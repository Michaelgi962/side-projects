He also led IBM's software sales efforts to large accounts in the United States and Canada where he was responsible for over $2,000 million annually in revenue. Similarly as a pioneering leader at IBM's Global Services Tony served as Program Director of Alliances to team with companies that began at zero, and in less than four years delivered more than $2,000 million/ year in incremental annual revenue to the company. Tony has also led the business development and strategy development efforts of several score small to mid-sized companies. He has also further honed his strategic skills with McKinsey and Company. 
Tony holds a B.S. in Mathematics obtained from work at the US Naval Academy, and the University of Oklahoma, as well as an MBA from Stanford University.

Thunderhawk (Dorney Park)

Thunderhawk (formerly known as The Coaster) is a wooden out and back roller coaster located at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom near Allentown, Pennsylvania. 
The coaster was built in 1923 and is one of the oldest operating roller coasters in the northeast.
History.
Thunderhawk was designed by Herbert Paul Schmeck and built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. When Thunderhawk opened in 1924 and for many years after the ride was known simply as the Coaster. The Coaster was renamed Thunderhawk with the addition of the Hercules roller coaster to the park in 1989.
Originally, the Coaster was built as an out-and-back coaster, meaning it went straight out from the first drop, turned around and came straight back. The ride was reconfigured in 1930 to its present design with a figure-eight twister section in the middle of the ride. Over the years, the ride has seen many cosmetic changes. At one point the ride featured a bright yellow paint job, which has since been painted over with an off-white color.
The original station pavilion featured a separate bumper car ride, around which wrapped the line for the Coaster, providing some entertainment to those waiting in line. Originally, the ride began with a tunneled section, and ended with another tunneled section, as the train went under the portion of the pavilion devoted to the bumper cars. However, the bumper cars were removed following Cedar Fair's purchase of the park in 1993, leaving the tunnel that began the ride as an open concrete trench. In addition, a set of brakes was placed in the middle of the return bunny hills causing the train to slow down and lose much of its trademark airtime. 
The Thunderhawk structure was maintained by carpenter Paul Hottenstein, nicknamed "Shorty" from 1961 until his sudden death in the winter of 2001. A plaque in the ride's station honors him and his work on the ride.
Thunderhawk continues to be one of the park's most popular and beloved rides. To this day, it remains a classic example of an early American wooden roller coaster.

Frost Valley YMCA

Frost Valley YMCA is a camping, environmental education, and conferencing center located in Claryville, New York, part of the Catskill Mountains. Founded in 1901 as Camp Wawayanda, the camp moved to its present location in 1958. 
During the summer, Frost Valley runs a camp for 6–15 year-olds, most of whom are from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Throughout the rest of the year, Frost Valley hosts school groups and other organizations for environmental education and conferencing activities.
Summer Camp.
The summer camp program at Frost Valley runs for eight weeks (four sessions, 12 days each). Each session starts on a Sunday and ends on a Friday, and nearly 500 campers attend each session. About 250 summer-time staff arrive the week before the first session, many of whom were campers when they were younger. Campers are broken up into villages by age and live together in cabin groups. Each village has a corresponding brother or sister village for the opposite gender of the same age. Camp is separated into two halves, Camp Wawayanda (ages 7–12) and Camp Henry Hird (ages 13–15). During the day, the camp schedule includes Specialties, Waterfront, Sports & Games, Feeling Good and an Evening Program.
The Wellness Philosophy has been a part of camp for several decades. The camp promotes growth in "mind, body, and spirit" and the motto is "Build Strong." Frost Valley focuses on keeping its guests healthy and happy.
The final week of summer is devoted to a Family Camp where family members from al generations come together for a week.
Villages.
Villages are groupings of cabins or lodges, and most villages accommodate 30–40 campers each. Campers live in cabins or lodges that sleep eight per room. There is a 1-to-4 or 5 counselor to camper ratio, except when a camper has dialysis, in that case, there is a 3:8 counselor to camper ratio.
The villages are:
There are also several mixed-gender villages with special focuses: Adventure Village (previously known as Woodwise), Sycamore, for the oldest campers, with special trips and leadership projects, and MAC (Mainstreaming at Camp, YAI National Institute for People with Disabilities, for children and young adults with developmental disabilities. 
Various other villages have also existed in the history of the camp, including Sequoia, an adventure village, and Phoenix, the precursor to Sycamore. Iscusfa was an arts program that was last ran in Summer 2006.
Dialysis program.
Established in 1975, over 1000 children and adolescents with kidney disease have attended the resident camp program at Frost Valley YMCA, under the supervision of the Ruth Gottscho Dialysis and Children's Kidney Program. The first program of its kind in the US, today the Frost Valley program is still unique in its efforts to mainstream the children with kidney disease into cabins and programs with other children. Children receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, in chronic renal failure, or post-transplant, are able to participate in a traditional residential camp experience, while gaining confidence and independence, in what may be their first time away from home. Campers are able to meet other children with medical problems similar to their own and are also able to be "teachers" to their counselors and cabin mates. They learn new skills and improve techniques for their own medical management. The children are part of the mainstream camp environment, and participate as fully as possible in all camping activities, meeting other campers from all walks of life, and from around the world. The program is based in a full-service, on-site dialysis unit, equipped for hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), as well as care of the post-transplant and pre-dialysis camper. The unit is staffed by pediatric nephrologists and nephrology nurses, under the supervision of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore. Special attention is given to the individual medical and developmental needs of each child, and treatment schedules are arranged to allow for maximum participation in camp activities.
Counselor-in-Training program.
The Counselor-in-Training (CIT) program is a month-long program for 16-year-olds who have an interest in becoming camp counselors. The program consists of three weeks at camp, training, working, and having an in-cabin experience, and one week hiking. During the in-camp portion, CITs work together to plan and run programs for campers. The out-trip has varied in length from 6 to 10 days and includes backpacking through the Catskill Mountains.
Adventure programs.
The Adventure Trip program has been in existence since 1968 when Henry "Bud" Cox took a group of teens on a 2-week backpacking trip throughout the Catskills. Today, Adventure Trips travel around the country and are expanding to international destinations as well. These trips are designed for boys and girls ages 11–17 who are looking for a different experience than the traditional resident camp. Trips vary from traditional backcountry adventures to service learning expeditions focused on giving back to needy communities. Activities available through the trip programs include whitewater rafting, rock climbing, backpacking, canoeing, surfing, skateboarding, spelunking, volunteer service, biking, sea kayaking, and high ropes. Other offerings are beginning to appear as well including a Spring Break trip to New Orleans to assist Habitat for Humanity.

Murder of Hannah Williams

The murder of Hannah Williams was an English case in which a 14-year-old schoolgirl was murdered after going missing during a shopping trip on 21 April 2001. Commentators, including the UK charity Missing People (formerly the National Missing Persons Helpline), have presented the contrasts in media coverage between this case and the cases of the murder of Danielle Jones and the murder of Amanda Dowler as examples of missing white woman syndrome.
Discovery of the body and conviction of the killer.
Williams's body was discovered on 15 March 2002 in an industrial area of Northfleet, Kent, beside the Thames estuary.
Initially the body was speculatively identified as that of Danielle Jones, who had been missing from East Tilbury in Essex since 18 June 2001, but it was soon firmly identified by Williams's distinctive clothing. The discovery of Williams's body overlapped with the investigation into the disappearance, and later murder, of Amanda Dowler from Surrey, who vanished on 21 March 2002.
Robert Lesarian Howard, a convicted sex offender who had known Williams since 1999, was arrested on 23 March 2002, eight days after her body was found. At his trial at Maidstone Crown Court in October 2003, Howard was found guilty of raping and murdering Williams, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
Contrasts in news media coverage.
There was a contrast between the girls' backgrounds and a parallel disparity between the news media coverage that each received: while images of Amanda, a middle-class girl from a stable family background who had never previously gone missing, were splashed on the front pages of national newspapers as her disappearance attracted national attention, and Danielle, similarly, fulfilled the news media's criteria for a model middle-class schoolgirl, Williams was a girl from a working-class single-parent home who had spent time in care and had a history of running away – she attracted scant coverage in the media.
A police spokesperson described Williams's mother as "not really press conference material" and, while Dowler and Jones continued to dominate newspaper headlines, Williams was almost immediately forgotten in the news media. The National Missing Persons Helpline noted, in commenting upon the case, that news media treating such stories would often ask for cases where the subject was female, within a particular age range and with a particular social background.
Most of the coverage of Williams, a total of 62 articles in British newspapers, was at the time of the initial discovery of her body and resulted from the initial interest in the possibility that the body was Jones. In contrast the media coverage of the two girls who were victims in the Soham murders generated 898 articles in under two weeks.
The only regular coverage was by the local newspapers "The Mercury" and the "South London Press" which covered the disappearance of Williams from two weeks after she first vanished to the day her body was found and beyond to the murder trial of her killer.
An anonymous Kent police officer was quoted in "The Guardian": 
"There are serious questions to be raised about the original missing persons investigation. This is very sensitive, but if Hannah Williams had been a Milly Dowler, she may not be dead now."

Fatherland and Liberty

The Fatherland and Liberty Nationalist Front (Spanish: Frente Nacionalista Patria y Libertad or simply Patria y Libertad, PyL) was a nationalist and authoritarian political and paramilitary group denounced by their opponents as being fascist and a front for Central Intelligence Agency activities in Chile.
The group was formed by Pablo Rodríguez Grez in 1970, and turned more and more clandestine throughout the presidency of Salvador Allende. It was officially disbanded on September 12, 1973, following Pinochet's coup.
In June 1973, the group attempted to carry out a coup against the Allende government but failed, in an event known as the Tanquetazo. In July 1973, it received orders from the Chilean Navy, which opposed the Schneider Doctrine of military adherence to the constitution, to sabotage Chile's infrastructure. The collaboration between Fatherland and Liberty and the Chilean Armed Forces increased after the failed October 1972 strike which had sought to overthrow the Allende administration. In agreement with the sectors opposing Allende in the military, the group assassinated on 26 July 1973 Allende's naval aide, Arturo Araya Peeters. The first sabotage was committed this same day. Others include creating a power outage while Allende was being broadcast.
Members of PyL were then recruited by Chilean security services and participated in the persecution of those opposed to Pinochet's junta. Since the transition to democracy, some small groups have since claimed to be its successor, but are not officially linked to the original PyL.
Creation of the group.
Headed by Pablo Rodríguez Grez, the group was spawned in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. It formally organized itself in 1970, a short time after the election of Salvador Allende. "Patria y Libertad" gathered mainly upper and middle-class students who, united by common anti-Communist beliefs and anti-parliamentarism, engaged in street brawls against leftist opponents, armed with nunchakus and molotov cocktails. "Patria y Libertad" criticized the division of Chile among various political parties, and hoped for the appearance of a ""caudillo"" which would transcend political divisions and become the "incarnation of the national sentiment". Along with the youth movement of the Christian Democracy and of the National Party, they participated in demonstrations against the Allende administration.
Financial support.
The group was funded by the CIA during the first year of Allende's presidency, including via the Agency's Track II program. According to Prof. Michael Stohl, and Prof. George A. Lopez, "After the failure to prevent Allende from taking office, efforts shifted to obtaining his removal. At least $7 million was authorized by the United States for CIA use in the destabilizing of Chilean society. This included financing and assisting opposition groups and right-wing paramilitary groups such as Patria y Libertad ("Fatherland and Liberty").". Although PyL was already dissolved, some of their former integrants continued collaborating with Pinochet's regime. Former head of DINA Manuel Contreras declared to Chilean justice in 2005 that the CNI, successor of DINA, handed out monthly payments between 1978 and 1990 to the persons who had worked with DINA agent Michael Townley in Chile, former members of PyL: Mariana Callejas (Townley's wife), Francisco Oyarzún, Gustavo Etchepare and Eugenio Berríos. Assassinated in 1995, Berrios, who worked as a chemist for the DINA in Colonia Dignidad, also worked with drug traffickers and DEA agents. Michael Townley has been convicted for the 1976 assassination of former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier, and was involved in the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires.
Clandestine activities.
June 1973 sabotage plan.
The Chilean Navy's June 1973 plan included sabotaging bridges, oil pipelines, energy towers and the fuel supply. The plan was revealed after the transition to democracy by Roberto Theime, leader of military operations for Fatherland and Liberty. Thieme exiled himself to Argentina after the failed "Tanquetazo", but returned to Chile in mid-July 1973, two months before the military coup. Thieme also revealed that in 1973, he was pressured by the military to assassinate Senator Carlos Altamirano, who had been the general secretary of the Chilean Socialist Party since 1971.
Olof Palme assassination.
The Swedish journalist Anders Leopold, in his 2008 book "Det svenska trädet skall fällas", makes the case that PyL leader Roberto Thieme was the assassin in the still-unsolved 1986 murder of Swedish prime minister Olof Palme. According to Leopold, the Swedish prime minister was killed because he had freely given asylum to so many leftist Chileans following the 1973 coup against Salvador Allende.
2004 declarations.
Roberto Thieme, leader of the military operations of PyL, signed on 2 December 2004, along with other leaders José Agustín Vásquez and Arturo Hoffmann, a declaration which referred to the Valech Report and begged pardon for their responsibilities in the repression against civilians operated by Pinochet's junta. They indicated that many members of the group had been recruited by the Chilean security services and had thus collaborated to the repression, including acts of torture and of forced disappearances. Thieme also opposed the neoliberal economic policies of Pinochet's regime, and criticized Pinochet's lack of repentance following his 1998 arrest in London and subsequent judicial procedures in Chile.
Judicial procedures.
Juan Patricio Abarzúa Cáceres, a former member of PyL, was arrested in 2005, charged of the "disappearance" of Juan Heredia, a Popular Unity government sympathiser "disappeared" on September 16th 1973

Ulmus chenmoui

Ulmus chenmoui W. C. Cheng, commonly known as the Chenmou, or Langya Mountain, Elm, is a small deciduous tree from the more temperate provinces of Anhui and Jiangsu in eastern China, where it is found at elevations below 200 m on the Langya Shan and Baohua Shan mountains.
Description.
Although the tree can grow to a height of < 20 m, the slender trunk rarely exceeds 0.5 m d.b.h.; the bark exfoliates in irregular flakes. The wing-less twigs bear comparatively large obovate to oblong leaves < 18 cm in length [http://www.asianflora.com/Ulmaceae/Ulmus-chienmoui.htm], with doubly serrate margins and caudate to acuminate apices. Leaves of specimens grown in the USA developed a thick pubescence, giving them a greyish appearance, but this has not been reciprocated in English - grown trees. The perfect wind-pollinated apetalous flowers are produced on second-year shoots in March; the samarae are obovate < 25 mm long by 17 mm wide and ripen in April.
Pests and diseases.
"U. chenmoui" has a very high resistance to Dutch elm disease, on a par with "Ulmus pumila", and is eschewed by the Elm Leaf Beetle "Xanthogaleruca luteola", but has a moderate susceptibility to Elm Yellows 
[http://www.sunshinenursery.com/survey.htm].
Cultivation.
The tree is rare in cultivation in the West, but is (2009) under evaluation at the Morton Arboretum in North America, and in Italy. It also featured in elm trials conducted by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) on gravelly soils in the Bois de Vincennes, Paris, but most specimens were killed by drought. Trees grown from seed obtained from the hills near Chu-hsien gave a more encouraging performance in the Netherlands where rather surprisingly, for a species accustomed to milder climes, they survived the cold winter of 1980/81 completely unscathed when temperatures fell to -19° C The tree is not currently known to be in commerce beyond the USA.
Notable trees.
The UK TROBI Champion grows at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens near Romsey, Hampshire; planted in 1994, it measured 8 m high by 22 cm d.b.h. in 2010. 
Cultivars & hybrid cultivars.
There are no known cultivars of this taxon. "U. chenmoui" has been hybridized with the Dutch clone '405' ("U. × hollandica" × "U. minor") by the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante (IPP), Florence, to create 'Morfeo', a robust, fast-growing tree patented and released to commerce in 2011. IPP also hybridized "U. chenmoui" with the early Dutch hybrid cultivar 'Groeneveld', identifying the new cultivar as FL '522', however there are no plans to release it to commerce.

GMCSD was managed by a Board of Directors composed of elected directors and community members. Elections were held each year during the Spring Concert period.
Origins.
GMCSD was a self-identified "gay" chorus that was incorporated January 1993 in San Diego, and began rehearsing in the Great Hall of the Cathedral Church of Saint Paul on 5th Avenue, under the artistic direction of Gary Holt.
The End of a Legacy.
In January 2010, The Gay Men's Chorus of San Diego formally merged with The San Diego Men's Chorus, forming a new performing arts entity titled the San Diego Gay Men's Chorus. Each of the two 'legacy' choruses participated under their separate names in a joint holiday concert at San Diego's Balboa Theatre in December 2009. Subsequently, they have been performing as a combined unit under the new name, with artistic direction by Gary Holt, and a combined total of about a hundred and twenty voices, making it one of the ten largest vocal ensembles in the GALA Choruses organization.

Doonfoot

Doonfoot is a part of the town of Ayr in south-west Scotland.
In 2008 there were many new houses built in Doonfoot, expanding the population substantially.
Doonfoot contains a primary school, a play park, and a local convenience shop. There are also plans for a new retirement home and community centre to be built along the Dunure Road sometime in the near future.
Belleisle Park, one of the largest parks in Ayr, borders Doonfoot. It contains two municipal golf courses run by South Ayrshire Council, Seafield and Belleisle. The latter was designed by James Braid and has hosted the Scottish Open and a number of amateur tournaments. It is often cited as one of the best public courses in Scotland, after courses such as St Andrews and Carnoustie. The park also houses a number of animals, including deer and an aviary. There is also a walled garden with a sundial in the middle, and a large glasshouse which contains tropical plants. In early 2009 two violent youths broke into the Pet's Corners grounds and shot two deer, this led to a decline in visitors and in the summer of 2009 forced the Pet's Corner to close indefinitely due to a lack of visitors. The large glasshouse containing tropical plants and an excellent statue is in a state of disrepair and closed to the public. The walled garden is still open, but rather quiet now as the Pets Corner was the main draw for families. 
Doonfoot is thought to extend westwards from the River Doon to the ruin of Greenan Castle, overlooking the seashore. The island of Arran is clearly visible across the Firth of Clyde from many points throughout Doonfoot. The beach at Doonfoot is popular in summer but, like many beaches along the Ayrshire coast, has failed to meet European Union standards for cleanliness under the Blue Flag scheme. The beach is often populated with a large number of seagulls.
The area known as Doonfoot was incorporated as part of the town of Ayr when the former Burgh of Ayr's boundaries were expanded in 1935 to take in the former villages of Alloway and Whitletts. Politically, since 1997 the area south of the Slaphouse Burn has been part of the Carrick, Cumnock & Doon Valley constituency rather than the Ayr constituency. Boundaries for UK Parliament constituencies were changed again in 2005, and Doonfoot was reunited with Ayr, but the division persists for the Scottish Parliament. This was unpopular locally, and former Member of Parliament Phil Gallie challenged this in court by way of a judicial review but this was unsuccessful.

"Safe in New York City" is a song by rock group AC/DC, from their 2000 album "Stiff Upper Lip". The song was also released as a single.
The video to the song, directed by Andy Morahan, shows the band playing a busy tunnel in the city, surrounded by armed police officers.
The promo CD single contained a live version of the song, which was recorded at America West Arena in Phoenix in September of 2000. This live version was later re-released nine years later on the box set "Backtracks."
The track gained poignancy after September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. Angus Young said that although originally the lyrics were meant to make fun of Rudy Giuliani's claim that he had cleaned up Manhattan: "to me New York is a city where you can never predict what's coming next." The song was later included in the 2001 Clear Channel memorandum, a list of "lyrically questionable" songs.
It reached #21 at the Mainstream Rock chart.

1977 Chicago Loop derailment

__NOTOC__
The 1977 Chicago Loop derailment occurred on February 4, 1977, when a Chicago Transit Authority elevated train rear-ended another on the northeast corner of the Loop at Wabash Avenue and Lake Street during the evening rush hour. The collision forced the first four cars of the rear train off the elevated tracks, killing 11 people and injuring over 180 as the cars fell onto the street below. The collision occurred less than a month after the Granville rail disaster in Australia.
Infrastructure layout.
"The Loop" not only refers to Chicago's central business district, but also a rectangular pattern formed by the city's elevated trains. Some trains entering the Loop do a complete circuit around the entire rectangular "loop", and after turning around all four corners, leave on the same path they came from. Other routes enter the Loop, turning only two of the corners, and then leave on a different route. Further complicating this is the fact that some trains' routes follow a clockwise pattern around the Loop, but others go counter-clockwise.
The 1977 crash itself involved trains from two lines. One was Ravenswood Line (today known as the Brown Line) and Lake–Dan Ryan Line (which no longer exists). However, a third train, from the Evanston Express (Purple Line), factored in as well.
Earlier in the day of the accident, a switching issue forced dispatchers to reroute the Evanston Express to run counter-clockwise around the Loop instead of its normal clockwise route. This put it on the tracks normally used by the Ravenswood and westbound Lake–Dan Ryan trains. Because of congestion caused by this abnormal track sharing, the Ravenswood train would be required to stop short, waiting for the rerouted Evanston Express to clear before proceeding. Additionally, this delay meant that the Ravenswood was still in place when the Lake–Dan Ryan train arrived on these tracks, and it too was required to stop and wait for the Ravenswood to clear the track before proceeding.
Collision.
At about 5:25 p.m., a Ravenswood train composed of 6000-series cars was waiting on the tracks, just past the northeast turn, waiting for the Evanston Express to clear the State/Lake platform. However, the Lake–Dan Ryan train, composed of 2000-series and 2200-series cars, did not stop as it approached the Ravenswood train. The Lake-Dan Ryan train proceeded against both track and cab signals, and struck the back of the Ravenswood. This initial impact was at a relatively slow speed, as the train had only started off a few seconds earlier and was still halfway through pulling out of . Passengers on the train reported the initial impact as nothing more than a slight bump.
However, after the impact, the motorman - Stephan A. Martin - continued to apply traction power. This resulted in the rear cars continuing to push forwards, pinning the front of the train against the waiting Ravenswood on the right-angle turn of the track. With the front Lake-Dan Ryan car unable to move forward, the pressure from behind caused the coupling bar between the first two cars to bend and the coupled ends of those two cars to be pushed in the air. As motor power continued to be applied, the first three cars were pushed further upwards, until they jackknifed and fell off the tracks. The second and third cars fell all the way to the street below, whilst the first fell onto a track support structure. The fourth car, pulled forward by the third, was derailed and dangled precariously between the track edge and surface street. The last four cars remained on the track - and, in fact, still in Randolph/Wabash station.
Investigation and CTA response.
Subsequent investigation revealed that Martin had been smoking marijuana and had four marijuana cigarettes in his shoulder bag. He also had a poor safety record and was responsible for an earlier derailment, and he had a tendency to talk to passengers while driving the train. It is theorized that, having made the normal station stop before the curve, Martin had caused the restrictive cab signal caused by the train ahead to be overridden. Distracted, he then left the station at under 15 miles per hour, which was slow enough to not trigger the automatic control, and then after the initial collision, panic or inertia caused him to move the Cineston controller forward resulting in the derailment.
As a result of the accident, the CTA forbade motormen to proceed past a red signal "on sight" without first getting permission from the Control Center.

Greenan Castle

Greenan Castle is a 16th-century tower house, possibly on the site of an ancient fort, around 2.5 miles south-west of Ayr in South Ayrshire, Scotland. The entrance lintel has the inscription, "JK 1603 FMD", for John Kennedy of Baltersan and his third wife, Florence MacDowell, who held the lands, Greenan Mill, and salmon fishing rights on the River Doon at that time. 
History.
The lands of Greenan were forfeited by John, Earl of Ross and Lord of the Isles in 1476 for treason against James III. In 1493 James IV granted the Lands of Greenan to William Douglas, son of Archibald, Earl of Angus. 
Beside the tower are traces of a walled courtyard and outbuildings -- probably stables and a kitchen block, as the small tower has no kitchen within its walls. In this courtyard on the morning of 12 May 1602, Sir Thomas Kennedy of Culzean and his servant, Lancelot Kennedy, mounted their horses to ride to Edinburgh, having spent the night before with Thomas's half-brother, John Kennedy of Baltersan. Just a few miles away in the woods of St Leonards (now a suburb of Ayr), they were ambushed by Thomas Kennedy (of Drummurchie), Thomas Kennedy (brother to the Laird of Bargany), Walter Muir of Cloncaird, Thomas M'Alexander, Thomas Wallace, a boy called Gilbert Ramsay and a borderer, Williame Irrwing. Sir Thomas was murdered in retaliation for the death of the young Laird of Bargany in December, 1601 at the Battle of Brockloch, near Maybole. Years later, the Muirs of Auchindrain (father and son) were executed for their "art and part" in this murder. The story inspired Sir Walter Scott to write a short play, "An Ayrshire Tragedy".

In 1975, Shabalala converted to Christianity and the group released their first religious album, "Ukukhanya Kwelanga". It earned a double platinum disc award, and the group's repertoire came to be dominated by hymns, mostly Methodist. Their 1976 "Ukusindiswa" became one of their most popular religious albums. By 1981, the group was well known throughout South Africa, and was allowed to travel to Cologne, Germany. The group toured the country and appeared on television, and learned some of the German language; the 1981 album "Phansi Emgodini" included a German-language song, "Wir Grüssen Euch Alle". The following year, the group traveled back to Germany to appear on a televised quiz show, bringing about requests for live appearances.

Magic Mike

Magic Mike is a 2012 American comedy-drama film directed by Steven Soderbergh and starring Channing Tatum, Alex Pettyfer, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, and Matthew McConaughey. The plot revolves around Adam, a 19-year-old who enters the world of male stripping, guided by Mike Lane, who has been in the business for six years.
The film is loosely based on the experiences of Tatum, who was an 18-year-old stripper in Tampa, Florida. "Magic Mike" was filmed in Los Angeles and Tampa. It premiered as the closing film for the 2012 Los Angeles Film Festival on June 24, 2012, and was widely released by Warner Bros. on June 29, 2012. The film received positive reviews upon its release and was a box-office success.
Plot.
Mike Lane has big plans for a business of his own but pays his bills through a series of odd jobs, most notably performing as the star stripper at Xquisite Strip Club, a club owned by Dallas, who has dreams of creating an "empire" of strip clubs.
Mike soon meets 19-year-old Adam, who has recently left school, and is looking for a construction job. Mike takes Adam under his wing and encourages him to begin stripping at Xquisite. Mike is introduced to Adam's sister Brooke. Despite his on-and-off relationship with a woman named Joanna, Mike finds himself attracted to Brooke and promises to look after Adam.
Adam falls further into the excessive lifestyle of the Xquisite dancers, using drugs and having sexual encounters with many clients. When Dallas announces he has a plan to move their act to Miami, Mike confides in Brooke that he is tiring of the lifestyle and wants to get a small business loan to pursue his dream of opening a custom furniture business. The bank declines his loan application and Mike realizes that he has to stay in the business to continue to pay his bills. Mike later attends a hurricane party at Dallas' house, where Adam becomes part of a scheme created by Tobias, Xquisite's DJ, to sell drugs to Xquisite's clients, and is eventually given a package of ecstasy. Adam begins using drugs regularly, and Mike notices more of Adam's reckless behavior to the chagrin of Brooke who is relying on Mike to protect him.
A few days later, Mike and Adam perform for a private party at a sorority house where Adam brings the package of drugs with him. At the party, Adam gives a young woman an ecstasy pill causing a brawl between Adam and the woman's boyfriend. Mike and Adam are forced to flee the scene. Later, at Xquisite, Dallas is infuriated to learn Mike didn't collect payment for the private show before the fight occurred. Also, Tobias becomes dismayed when he discovers that Adam had left the package of drugs, worth $10,000 in all, at the sorority.
After the next night's show at the club is finished, Mike and Adam take drugs and go to a club. Adam winds up vomiting and passing out, where Brooke finds him on the floor the next morning. Brooke angrily confronts Mike about his lifestyle, and ends her friendship with him. Later on, Tobias' suppliers break into Mike's house looking for Adam. After realizing Adam lied to him about the drugs' worth, Mike gives them $10,000 (most of his life savings) to pay Adam's debt (unbeknownst to Brooke).
Later, before the dancer's final performance at Xquisite, Mike decides he has had enough. Knowing that Dallas has no loyalty to any of them, and is driven by greed, Mike leaves through the club's exit. He drives away to end up at Brooke's apartment where he tells her he is through with stripping.
After realizing 'Magic Mike' is not coming back, Dallas invites Adam to replace Mike as the frontman of the dancers. Brooke and Mike realize they have an attraction for each other, and make plans for breakfast.
Production.
Development.
"Magic Mike" is directed by Steven Soderbergh based on a screenplay by Reid Carolin, who is also one of the film's producers. The screenplay is in part inspired by Channing Tatum's experiences as a stripper in Tampa, Florida, when he was 18 years old. Tatum told that he wanted to capture the atmosphere and energy of his past as a stripper, but that the film is fictional, which allowed them to create their own scenarios. The project, announced in April 2011 was co-financed by Soderbergh and Tatum. In 2010, Tatum told an Australian newspaper that he would like to make a movie about his experiences as a stripper, saying, "I've already got the director picked out. I'd like Nicolas Refn, who did the film "Bronson", to do it because he's insane for it." Refn initially agreed on doing the film because Tatum and he were going to do another movie together. However, since that project did not get off the ground and due to his busy schedule, Tatum, who was then working with Soderbergh on "Haywire," brought him the idea. After Soderbergh cast Tatum and Pettyfer in the lead roles, Carolin spent time revising the screenplay. He wrote the first draft in a month. Soderbergh suggested showing two points of view in the film: seeing through the eyes of young Adam and of his mentor Mike.
The dance numbers were choreographed by Alison Faulk, while Christopher Peterson was in charge of the costumes design and Frankie Pine supervised the music. Over the film, several dance numbers were performed. Music producer Jack Rayner created a special dubstep version of the song "It's Raining Men" sung by Countré Black for the dance sequence that features the ensemble for the first time together without The Kid. For that sequence, Peterson chose to use spray glitter on the umbrellas and raincoats to give them a wet effect. The Kid's first strip did not purposely have any choreography and it was Pettyfer's idea to show his bottom. Before doing his moves, Pettyfer did not know the song that was going to be played which ended up being Madonna's "Like a Virgin". The five-stripper group performed the song "Sound Off (The Duckworth Chant)" with lyric changes on the military-themed number. The scene during which Mike and Adam arrive at a sorority house dressed as cops was not in the original script but was Peterson's idea. Music supervisor Pine initially planned to use Kid Rock's "Cowboy" for the cowboy-themed number featuring The Kid. When it was not possible, she chose Big & Rich's "Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)" instead. Knowing Tatum's dance skills, Faulk gave him the permission to freestyle for Mike's last solo dance on the dubstep song "Calypso" by Excision and Datsik. McConaughey who had no stripping scene in the original script requested to have one which became the last dance number during which he first sings "Ladies of Tampa" and then strips. The song was written in three hours by music supervisor Frankie Pine, Matthew McConaughey and Martin Blasick, McConaughey's guitar coach. The thongs were made by company Pistol Pete.
Casting.
On August 16, 2011, it was reported that Matthew McConaughey had landed a role in the film. He was the first person cast, aside from Tatum. McConaughey told that Soderbergh called him to offer him the role of Dallas. After Soderbergh pitched him the story, McConaughey laughed and in 10 minutes he accepted the role. It was the second time he accepted a role over the phone; the first time was for a Richard Linklater film. Commenting on the role, the actor said: "I knew that I was just going to be able to fly. It was really fun to play someone so committed, in many ways." Joe Manganiello accepted the role of Big Dick Richie after talking to "What to Expect When You're Expecting" co-star Chris Rock who convinced him to do it. Cody Horn gave her insight on how she got the part of Brooke:
The cast visited a strip club to see what this world was like and the dance routines and to get information on the backstage life. To prepare for the role, McConaughey went in a Los Angeles strip mall to get used to regular waxing. Matt Bomer had to put on about 15 pounds for his part. Adam Rodriguez went through a cardio and weights training.
Filming.
Principal photography commenced in Playa del Rey, Los Angeles in September 2011 and concluded in Tampa by late October. The scenes that took place in the fictional club Xquisite were filmed in Studio City, Los Angeles. Locations in Florida included the Fort Desoto Bridge, the Dunedin coast, the Gulf of Mexico, Tampa, Ybor City, St. Petersburg, Tarpon Springs, and Tierra Verde. Soderbergh chose to shoot the entirety of the film with a double straw camera filter, except the interior of the club.
Music.
The soundtrack was released on June 28, 2012, through WaterTower Music. Other songs featured in the film include Cobra Starship's "#1Nite", Sean Paul's "Got 2 Luv U", and Ginuwine's "Pony".
Release.
Warner Bros. Pictures acquired US distribution rights to the independently produced film on October 27, 2011. "Magic Mike" was first screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival as the closing film on June 24, 2012, and was widely released on June 29, 2012, in the United States.
Marketing.
The first full-length trailer for "Magic Mike" was released on iTunes on April 18, 2012 with a poster indicating the film's name. The first poster featuring the cast was released on June 1, 2012, along with a new trailer. A second poster followed on June 4, 2012, and a fourth trailer was released on June 13, 2012. To promote the film, Channing Tatum, Matthew McConaughey, Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer participated in a photo shoot for "Entertainment Weekly" that came out in the May 25, 2012, issue. Tatum, McConaughey, and Manganiello attended the MTV Movie Awards where they presented the award for the best on-screen transformation. During the presentation, Manganiello arrived dressed as a fireman stripper.
The promotional campaign, which originally centered on women, also targeted the gay community after it had been made clear that there was a strong interest among them. Warner Bros. enlisted entertainment marketing agency the Kartel Group to market the film to gay men. Website AfterElton.com noted that gay men could not connect with the first trailer as the film "was marketed as a romantic comedy" through Tatum and Horn's relationship, but that it changed when the camapaign also focused on "the male form part of it film" through a red-band trailer (the fourth one). In June 2012, a "Magic Mike" float was included in the West Hollywood gay pride parade and in other gay pride events such as in New York and in San Francisco.
Box office.
"Magic Mike" proved to be a box office hit, grossing $113,721,571 and $53,500,000 outside North America with a total gross of $167,221,571 worldwide from a modest $7 million budget; it is the highest top-grossing movie under the Dance genre. On its opening day (June 29, 2012), the film performed better than expected, earning about $19 million including a $2 million midnight run. It finished the weekend at the second spot behind "Ted" with a total of $39,127,170. It was the first time two R-rated films grossed more than $21 million each during a weekend. CinemaScore reported that audiences gave a "B" average grade.
On its opening weekend, "Magic Mike" attracted an audience of 73% females, including 43% of women over the age of 35. Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. Pictures President of Domestic Distribution, said this phenomenon could be compared to "Sex and the City", which had also appealed to large groups of women.
Reception.
"Magic Mike" has received positive reviews. Based on 186 reviews collected by aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 80% approval rating, with an average score of 6.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, ""Magic Mike" sensitive direction, smart screenplay, and strong performances allows audiences to have their beefcake and eat it too." By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating in the 0–100 range based reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 72, indicating "generally positive reviews", based on 38 reviews. The movie also launched Academy Award buzz for Matthew McConaughey as Dallas. He, however, was not selected for inclusion among the nominees, which was described as a "snub" by many.
"Magic Mike" appeared on several critics' lists of the best films of 2012:
Home media.
"Magic Mike" was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on October 23, 2012. 698,497 DVD units were sold within its first week, generating revenue of $10,449,515. As of December 23, 2012, DVD sales totaled over 1.9 million units with $26,362,047 in revenue.
Sequel.
In a Twitter Q&A in July 2012, Tatum confirmed work on a sequel. The actor responded: "Yes, yes and yes! We're working on the concept now. We want to flip the script and make it bigger." By March 2014, "Magic Mike" first assistant director Greg Jacobs had been chosen to direct the sequel, title "Magic Mike XXL" and scheduled to begin shooting in Northern Hemisphere autumn 2014. The film is set for July 3, 2015 release.
In July 2014 Joe Manganiello stated on The Wendy Williams Show that he's interested in doing the sequel, and can't imagine a sequel without his character in it.
Stage musical.
Reid Carolin, who wrote the film, is adapting the film as a stage musical for Broadway.

The 7 Ps is a British Army adage for Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance.
The 7 Ps are normally referred to as ""the 7 Ps"" rather than as an acronym: (i.e. PPPPPPP). Educators and trainers in military or civilian situations find it useful to first introduce the phrase "the 7 Ps". When it is explained, the humour and shock of the mild expletive help make the adage memorable. This adage is often used in project planning, or when training for life-or-death situations.

David Dundas (politician)

Sir David Dundas QC (1799–1877) was a Scottish lawyer and Liberal politician.
Dundas was educated at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1823, and appointed Queen's Counsel in February 1840.
He was elected to represent Sutherland in Parliament as a Liberal in March 1840. In July 1846 he was appointed Solicitor General for England and Wales. At the time, it was the normal practice that accepting ministerial office caused a by-election; he was re-elected on 28 July. In February 1846 he was knighted, a traditional perquisite of the office, but he resigned the position in March 1848 due to ill-health and returned to the backbenches. In May 1849 he was appointed Judge Advocate General, again re-elected in a by-election on 5 June, and made a member of the Privy Council on 29 June.
He retired from politics in the 1852 general election, and was succeeded by the Marquess of Stafford, also a Liberal.
In retirement he lived and worked in his chambers at the Inner Temple; among other work, he served as a Trustee of the British Museum. His retirement from politics was not permanent; when Stafford was elevated to the House of Lords in March 1861 on becoming the third Duke of Sutherland, Dundas returned to Parliament. He stood down again in May 1867, being succeeded by Lord Ronald Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Duke's younger brother.

<doc id="5920634" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5920634" title="Discrete event simulation">
Discrete event simulation

In the field of simulation, a discrete-event simulation (DES), models the operation of a system as a discrete sequence of events in time. Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of state in the system. Between consecutive events, no change in the system is assumed to occur; thus the simulation can directly jump in time from one event to the next.
This contrasts with continuous simulation in which the simulation continuously tracks the system dynamics over time. Instead of being event-based, this is called an activity-based simulation; time is broken up into small time slices and the system state is updated according to the set of activities happening in the time slice. Because discrete-event simulations do not have to simulate every time slice, they can typically run much faster than the corresponding continuous simulation.
Another alternative to event-based simulation is process-based simulation. In this approach, each activity in a system corresponds to a separate process, where a process is typically simulated by a thread in the simulation program. In this case, the discrete events, which are generated by threads, would cause other threads to sleep, wake, and update the system state.
A more recent method is the three-phased approach to discrete event simulation (Pidd, 1998). In this approach, the first phase is to jump to the next chronological event. The second phase is to execute all events that unconditionally occur at that time (these are called B-events). The third phase is to execute all events that conditionally occur at that time (these are called C-events). The three phase approach is a refinement of the event-based approach in which simultaneous events are ordered so as to make the most efficient use of computer resources. The three-phase approach is used by a number of commercial simulation software packages, but from the user's point of view, the specifics of the underlying simulation method are generally hidden.
Example.
A common exercise in learning how to build discrete-event simulations is to model a queue, such as customers arriving at a bank to be served by a teller. In this example, the system entities are Customer-queue and Tellers. The system events are Customer-Arrival and Customer-Departure. (The event of Teller-Begins-Service can be part of the logic of the arrival and departure events.) The system states, which are changed by these events, are Number-of-Customers-in-the-Queue (an integer from 0 to n) and Teller-Status (busy or idle). The random variables that need to be characterized to model this system stochastically are Customer-Interarrival-Time and Teller-Service-Time. An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator is another example for a discrete event simulation.
Components of a discrete-event simulation.
In addition to the logic of what happens when system events occur, discrete event simulations include the following:
State.
A system state is a set of variables that captures the salient properties of the system to be studied. The state trajectory overtime S(t) can mathematically represented by a step function whose values change in correspondence of discrete events.
Clock.
The simulation must keep track of the current simulation time, in whatever measurement units are suitable for the system being modeled. In discrete-event simulations, as opposed to real-time simulations, time ‘hops’ because events are instantaneous – the clock skips to the next event start time as the simulation proceeds.
Events list.
The simulation maintains at least one list of simulation events. This is sometimes called the "pending event set"
because it lists events that are pending as a result of previously simulated event but have yet to be simulated themselves.
An event is described by the time at which it occurs and a type, indicating the
code that will be used to simulate that event. It is common for the event code to be parametrized, in which case, the event description also contains parameters to the event code.
When events are instantaneous, activities that extend over time are modeled as sequences of events. Some simulation frameworks allow the time of an event to be specified as an interval, giving the start time and the end time of each event.
Single-threaded simulation engines based on instantaneous events have just one current event. In contrast, multi-threaded simulation engines and simulation engines supporting an interval-based event model may have multiple current events. In both cases, there are significant problems with synchronization between current events.
The pending event set is typically organized as a priority queue, sorted by event time. That is, regardless of the order in which events are added to the event set, they are removed in strictly chronological order. Several general-purpose priority queue algorithms have proven effective for discrete-event simulation, most notably, the splay tree. More recent alternatives include skip lists, "calendar queues". and "ladder queues".
Typically, events are scheduled dynamically as the simulation proceeds. For example, in the bank example noted above, the event CUSTOMER-ARRIVAL at time t would, if the CUSTOMER_QUEUE was empty and TELLER was idle, include the creation of the subsequent event CUSTOMER-DEPARTURE to occur at time t+s, where s is a number generated from the SERVICE-TIME distribution.
Random-number generators.
The simulation needs to generate random variables of various kinds, depending on the system model. This is accomplished by one or more Pseudorandom number generators. The use of pseudo-random numbers as opposed to true random numbers is a benefit should a simulation need a rerun with exactly the same behavior.
One of the problems with the random number distributions used in discrete-event simulation is that the steady-state distributions of event times may not be known in advance. As a result, the initial set of events placed into the pending event set will not have arrival times representative of the steady-state distribution. This problem is typically solved by bootstrapping the simulation model. Only a limited effort is made to assign realistic times to the initial set of pending events. These events, however, schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its steady state. This is called "bootstrapping" the simulation model. In gathering statistics from the running model, it is important to either disregard events that occur before the steady state is reached or to run the simulation for long enough that the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior. (This use of the term "bootstrapping" can be contrasted with its use in both statistics and computing.)
Statistics.
The simulation typically keeps track of the system's statistics, which quantify the aspects of interest. In the bank example, it is of interest to track the mean waiting times. In a simulation model, performance metrics are not analytically derived from probability distributions, but rather as averages over replications, that is different runs of the model. Confidence intervals are usually constructed to help assess the quality of the output.
Ending condition.
Because events are bootstrapped, theoretically a discrete-event simulation could run forever. So the simulation designer must decide when the simulation will end. Typical choices are “at time t” or “after processing n number of events” or, more generally, “when statistical measure X reaches the value x”.
Simulation engine logic.
The main loop of a discrete-event simulation is something like this:
“Do loop” or “while loop”.
While (Ending Condition is FALSE) then do the following:
Common uses.
Diagnosing process issues.
Simulation approaches are particularly well equipped to help users diagnose issues in complex environments. The Goal (Theory of Constraints) illustrates the importance of understanding bottlenecks in a system. Only process ‘improvements’ at the bottlenecks will actually improve the overall system. In many organizations bottlenecks become hidden by excess inventory, overproduction, variability in processes and variability in routing or sequencing. By accurately documenting the system inside a simulation model it is possible to gain a bird’s eye view of the entire system.
A working model of a system allows management to understand performance drivers. A simulation can be built to include any number of performance indicators such as worker utilization, on-time delivery rate, scrap rate, cash cycles, and so on.
Hospital applications.
An operating theater is generally shared between several surgical disciplines. Through better understanding the nature of these procedures it may be possible to increase the patient throughput.
Example: If a heart surgery takes on average four hours, changing an operating room schedule from eight available hours to nine will not increase patient throughput. On the other hand, if a hernia procedure takes on average twenty minutes providing an extra hour may also not yield any increased throughput if the capacity and average time spent in the recovery room is not considered.
Lab test performance improvement ideas.
Many systems improvement ideas are built on sound principles, proven methodologies (Lean, Six Sigma, TQM, etc.) yet fail to improve the overall system. A simulation model allows the user to understand and test a performance improvement idea in the context of the overall system.
Evaluating capital investment decisions.
Simulation modeling is commonly used to model potential investments. Through modeling investments decision-makers can make informed decisions and evaluate potential alternatives.
Network simulators.
Discrete event simulation is used in computer network to simulate new protocols for different network traffic scenarios before deployment.

Texas Emerging Technology Fund

The Texas Emerging Technology Fund (often abbreviated as TETF or ETF) is a technology investment fund created by legislation in 2005 at the urging of Governor Rick Perry to provide Texas with an unparalleled advantage in the research, development, and commercialization of emerging technologies. The enabling legislation (Texas HB1188 of the 79th Legislature) launched the ETF with $200 million to help create jobs and develop the economy of Texas. Legislative revisions during the 2007 and 2009 sessions have expanded the total funds under management to approximately $500 million. 
As of October 2010, the program has given a total of $173 million to 120 companies as well as $161 million to educational institutions.
Fund administration.
Investment Focus.
The ETF focuses on three main investment areas: 
ETF's first investments were executed in May 2006. By October 1, 2009, the ETF was the single largest pre-seed investor for emerging technology companies in the entire United States. As of June 6, 2011, the ETF had invested $196M in 132 commercialization investments. Approximately 1/2 of ETF's commercialization investments have been made within the biotechnology and life sciences industry.
Deal Sourcing.
The ETF established seven Regional Centers of Innovation and Commercialization (RCICs) to foster technology commercialization throughout the entire state of Texas and act as an efficient deal sourcing mechanism. In addition, a statewide Life Science Regional Center of Innovation and Commercialization also was formed. The RCICs act as the regional agent to identify, evaluate, and submit promising proposals from their respective regions to the ETF Advisory Committee. The ETF Advisory Committee makes final decisions on awards. RCICs work closely with applicants in assisting with ETF proposal development, post-proposal debriefings, and commercialization activities. In addition, RCICs are a strong focal point to increasing cooperation and spurring collaboration between industrial, financial, and academic entities.
Accolades.
The ETF has been recognized nationally as the most active early-stage technology venture funds in the country. The fund estimates that portfolio companies and awardees have raised close to $1B in follow-on investment and private funding following ETF investment. Cardiospectra, Inc., an ETF portfolio company, was acquired by Volcano Corporation in December 2007 for $25M in cash with an additional $38M available upon the achievement of specific milestones. ETF's return on investment on the Cardiospectra deal was 216% as of January 2011.
Fund Management.
The ETF is housed within the Economic Development and Tourism division of the Texas State Government. Patrick Boswell currently serves as the TETF Acting Director. Prior ETF Directors include Jonathan Taylor, Mark Ellison and Alan Kirchhoff. You can visit the TETF website at: http://www.emergingtechfund.com
Debates and commentary about funding.
An October 2010 article by the "Dallas Morning News" editorial board argued for fundamental reform in how the fund works. The board stated, "The way Texas doles out money... raises such serious questions about the role of political donations in the fund's operation that the governor and the Texas Legislature should revamp it." Although the board considered it "a valuable program", it remarked that "other states have tried to keep politicians at arm's length from the selection and funding process... Texas needs to do the same".
In response to criticisms, Governor Perry has said that it "is a pretty rare occurrence" for him to know that political supporters have connections to firms that receive funding. 
Many involved in the ETF process firmly believe the implications and criticisms of the press, most notably the "Dallas Morning News", to be "inaccurate and ignoring the hundreds of individuals around the state that freely devote their time, energy and efforts to the process to ensure that Texas is pushing the technological envelope that will lead to scientific breakthroughs and a stronger economy." Despite criticism by the press, a majority of the ETF's 140 investments since 2005 are still operating as of February 2013.

<doc id="5920645" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5920645" title="First Maroon War">
First Maroon War

The First Maroon War was a conflict between the Jamaican Maroons and the British in Jamaica which reached a climax in 1731.
Background.
In 1655, the British defeated the Spanish colonists and took control of most of Jamaica. Following the flight of the Spanish, the Africans whom they had enslaved joined the Amerindian population (and some others who had previously escaped slavery) in the mountainous centre of Jamaica to form the Windward Maroon communities. The area is known as Cockpit Country. The British forces were unable to establish control over the whole island, a large portion remaining in the hands of the Maroons. For seventy six years, there were periodic skirmishes between the British and the Maroons, alongside occasional slave revolts. In 1673 one such revolt in St. Ann's Parish of 200 slaves created the separate group of Leeward Maroons. These Maroons united with a group of Madagascars who had survived the shipwreck of a slave ship and formed their own maroon community in St. George's parish. Several more rebellions strengthened the numbers of this Leeward group. Notably, in 1690 a revolt at Sutton's plantation, Clarendon of 400 slaves considerably strengthened the Leeward Maroons. In September 1728, the British sent more troops to Jamaica, changing the balance of power with the Windward Maroons.
The Leeward Maroons inhabited "cockpits," caves, or deep ravines that were easily defended, even against troops with superior firepower. Such guerrilla warfare and the use of scouts who blew the abeng (the cow horn, this was used as a trumpet) to warn of approaching British soldiers allowed the Maroons to evade, thwart, frustrate, and defeat the forces of an Empire.
The treaty.
In 1739-40, the British government in Jamaica recognized that it could not defeat the Maroons, so they came to an agreement with them instead. The Maroons were to remain in their five main towns (Accompong, Trelawny Town, Moore Town, Scott's Pass, Nanny Town), living under their own rulers and a British supervisor.
In exchange, they were asked to agree not to harbour new runaway slaves, but rather to help catch them. This last clause in the treaty naturally caused a split between the Maroons and the rest of the black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into Maroon settlements.
Another provision of the agreement was that the Maroons would serve to protect the island from invaders. The latter was because the Maroons were revered by the British as skilled warriors.
The person responsible for the compromise with the British was the Leeward Maroon leader, Cudjoe, a short, almost dwarf-like man who for years fought skillfully and bravely to maintain his people's independence. As he grew older, however, Cudjoe became increasingly disillusioned. He ran into quarrels with his lieutenants and with other Maroon groups. He felt that the only hope for the future was honorable peace with the enemy, which was just what the British were thinking. The 1739 treaty should be seen in this light.
A year later, the even more rebellious Windward Maroons of Trelawny Town also agreed to sign a treaty under pressure from both white Jamaicans and the Leeward Maroons, though they were never happy about it. This discontentment with the treaty later led to the Second Maroon War.

The Tuzla massacre was a massacre of civilians committed by the Army of Republika Srpska on 25 May 1995 in Tuzla during the Bosnian War.
The massacre.
Between 25 May and 28 May 1995 a number of artillery projectiles were fired at Tuzla from Army of Republika Srpska positions near the village of Panjik on Mount Ozren some 25 km west of Tuzla. On 25 May 1995 (Marshall Tito's birthday and Relay of Youth in former Yugoslavia) at 20:55 hours, a shrapnel shell fired by a 130mm towed artillery piece, detonated in the part of the city called Kapija. There were 71 people killed and 240 wounded. All of the victims were civilians and the majority were between the ages of 18-25.
War crime verdict.
Novak Đukić, a former Army of Republika Srpska officer was arrested in Banja Luka on 7 November 2007. At the time of the Tuzla massacre Đukić was the commander of the "Tactical Group Ozren" of the VRS. His trial began on 11 March 2008. On 12 June 2009, Đukić was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.
Denial.
In 2009, the prime minister of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, stated that the attack was staged and questioned the Markale massacres at Sarajevo. The Tuzla municipality filed charges against Dodik over these statements. The city of Sarajevo filed criminal charges against Dodik for abuse of power, and inciting ethnic, racial and religious hatred.
The Office of the High Representative said Dodik denied the war crimes committed and stated that "When such skewed facts come from an official in a position of high responsibility, an official who is obliged to uphold the Dayton Peace Accords and cooperate with the Hague Tribunal, then they are particularly irresponsible and undermine not only the institutions responsible for upholding the rule of law, but the credibility of the individual himself".

Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart

Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart is a private, Catholic college preparatory school located in Madison, Wisconsin. Edgewood has been sponsored since its inception by the Dominican Sisters of Sinsinawa, WI. Edgewood's mission is to educate the whole student for a life of learning, service and personal responsibility through a rigorous academic curriculum embracing the Sinsinawa Dominican values of Truth, Compassion, Justice, Partnership and Community.

History.
Edgewood has history dating back to Samuel Mazzuchelli. The school began in 1871 as Saint Regina Academy, an all-girls boarding school. Governor Cadwallader Washburn donated his official residence, "Edgewood Villa", after losing a bid for re-election. Saint Regina Academy continued to operate until a fire in 1895 destroyed the original building. Less than a year after the fire the school re-opened as the Academy of the Sacred Heart. In 1927, the original building was completed according to the design of Philadelphia architect Albert Kelsey, son-in-law of Governor Cadwallader Washburn, under the name Edgewood High School of the Sacred Heart. A large addition of a new classroom wing, gymnasium, swimming pool and Commons was completed in 1967. In the 1990s the school added another gym and a science center, which is used cooperatively by three Edgewood schools on the campus.
Academics.
The Edgewood curriculum encompasses 133 credit-eligible courses across twelve departments. The school also teaches 12 AP (Advanced Placement) courses, including English, Calculus, 2nd Year Calculus Honors, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Environmental Science, European History, U.S. History, Spanish, French & Latin. The school's student literary magazine, musical productions, remote environmental science field course and Latin oratory are all award-winning programs.

Ford BC-Series transmission

The BC-series manual transmissions are a series of manual transaxles produced by Ford in Europe for its front wheel drive automobiles from 1976 onwards. Originally debuting in the Mk.1 Ford Fiesta, the unit was later used in Ford's other front wheel drive vehicles, most notably the Ford Escort and Orion. 
The unit features a 20mm x 17 spline input shaft, uses a rod-based shift linkage and was originally only available in 4-speed format, designated as BC4, and designed to mate either with the Valencia version of the OHV Ford Kent engine, or the CVH unit.

Vassilis Spanoulis

Vassilis Spanoulis () (born August 7, 1982) is a Greek professional basketball player for Olympiacos Piraeus of the Greek Basket League and the Euroleague. A 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall combo guard, he is nicknamed Kill Bill, V-Span, and MVP ("Most Vassilis Player"). Spanoulis was named the Balkan Athlete of the Year in 2009, the All-Europe Player of the Year in 2012 and 2013, and the Euroleague MVP in 2013. He has earned five All-Euroleague Team selections.
Spanoulis first played for Gymnastikos S. Larissa, and enjoyed a highly successful career start, winning the Greek Basket League's Best Young Player award in 2002. His skill-set earned him a transfer to Athens and Maroussi. Following an impressive 2004–05 season, during which he helped to lead Maroussi to the Greek Basket League Finals, and the Eurocup quarterfinals, he moved to Panathinaikos, where he became one of European basketball's major stars.
In the 2005–06 Euroleague season, Spanoulis made his debut in impressive fashion, earning his first All-Euroleague Team selection as a rookie in the competition. After a stint in the NBA with the Houston Rockets during the 2006–07 season, he returned to Panathinaikos and helped to lead them to a Euroleague title in 2009, being voted as the Euroleague Final Four MVP. Spanoulis' transfer to Olympiacos, in the summer of 2010, marked a new step in his career. Within a young and rebuilding team, Spanoulis not only led a Euroleague title run in 2012, but went on to achieve a historical repeat in 2013. In the process he gained another two Euroleague Final Four MVP awards, thus joining Toni Kukoč as the only players to achieve that distinction on three occasions.
Spanoulis played an instrumental role on the Greek national team's FIBA EuroBasket 2005 gold medal team. Most importantly, he was one of the main stars of Greece's 2006 FIBA World Championship silver medal team, scoring 22 points in the victory over Team USA in the tournament's semifinals. It was however, Greece's bronze medal at the FIBA EuroBasket 2009, that emphasized Spanoulis' leadership within an injury-plagued Greek national team, consequently earning an All-EuroBasket Team honor.
Professional career.
Gymnastikos S. Larissa.
Spanoulis began his basketball career with the youth teams of Gymnastikos and Keravnos in Larissa, Greece, playing in the junior levels from 1994, until 1999. He made his professional debut in the year 1999, at the age of 17, with the senior club of Gymnastikos S. Larissa. In the two seasons of 1999–00 and 2000–01, he played in the Greek A2 League with Gymnastikos.
Maroussi.
After playing with Gymnastikos S. Larissa for three seasons, Spanoulis signed a four-year contract with Maroussi of the Greek Basket League, EuroChallenge, and later the Eurocup, and played there until 2005.
During the 2001–02 season, Spanoulis helped to lead Maroussi to the Greek Cup Final. This was the first time the team had ever made it to the Greek Cup Championship game. Maroussi also competed in the Korać Cup that year.
During the 2002–03 season, Spanoulis helped to lead Maroussi to the Final Four of the EuroChallenge. Spanoulis averaged 10.8 points per game and 6.4 assists per game off the bench for Maroussi. He also shot 40% from three-point range. He was named both the league 6th man of the year and rookie of the year.
In the 2003–04 season, Vassilis helped to lead Maroussi to the Greek Basket League Finals, and also to the EuroChallenge Final. He was named the Eurobasket.com website's Greek Basket League Most Improved Player of the Year. Spanoulis was drafted in the 2nd round of the 2004 NBA Draft, by the Dallas Mavericks, following this sudden emergence. He also made it onto the senior men's Greek national basketball team at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympic Games.
In the 2004–05 season, his last with Maroussi, Spanoulis averaged 15.9 points per game and shot 37.8% from 3-point range, in 35 games of Greek Basket League competition. He then averaged 15.2 points per game, and shot 40.0% from 3-point range, in 12 games of play in the Eurocup. For the year in total, Spanoulis averaged 15.7 points per game, and shot 38.3% from 3-point range, in 47 games for Maroussi. He played in the 2005 Greek League All-Star Game, and was named to the Greek Basket League's Best Five team. This was a breakthrough year for Vassilis, as he had averaged 11.1 points per game the previous year. He was considered to be one of the most improved players in Europe for the year. He helped to lead Maroussi to the 2nd place of the Greek Basket League, for the regular season. At the end of the year, Spanoulis was voted European 6th Man of the Year and Rookie of the Year in the Eurocup.
He was started being called, "The Greek Steve Nash", by some European fans in Europe after this year.
Panathinaikos Athens.
Following his outstanding season in 2004–05 with Maroussi, he signed a 3-year contract worth €1.6 million euros net income with Euroleague powerhouse Panathinaikos Athens. Spanoulis and his agent, Miodrag Ražnatović, set the contract terms so that Spanoulis would have a buyout clause after just one year, and set the buyout amount at US $400,000.
With Panathinaikos, in the Greek Basket League 2005–06 season, he won the both Greek Basket League championship and the Greek Cup. His team went 24–2 during the Greek Basket League regular season, and 8–0 during the playoffs, for an overall record of 32–2 in the league championship, and also went undefeated in the Cup, at 5–0, for an overall record of 37–2 in Greek competitions. He played in the 2006 Greek League All-Star Game, and was named to the Greek Basket League's Best Five team.
Spanoulis was also selected to the Euroleague 2005–06 season's All-Euroleague Second Team.
In 28.8 minutes per game of play, during the 2005–06 Euroleague competition, Spanoulis averaged 14.6 points, 3.1 assists, 2.0 rebounds, and 1.4 steals, in 23 games of Euroleague play, with Panathinaikos Athens for the season. He also shot 61.8% in 2-point shooting, and 36.8% from 3-point range; 53.4% overall.
He was the team's leading scorer, even though he often came off the bench. He won the Euroleague MVP of the Week Award twice during the season. In 2005–06, his team finished the Euroleague with a record of 16–7. Spanoulis was also voted as the 7th best worldwide European player of the year (including NBA players) in 2006, by FIBA Europe, in their FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award voting.
Many fans in Europe began calling him, "Euro Kobe", after such a dominant rookie season of Euroleague.
Houston Rockets.
On July 19, 2006, Spanoulis opted out of the final two years of his contract with Panathinaikos Athens, and signed a three-year deal (2 years guaranteed) with the NBA's Houston Rockets, who paid for his contract buyout from Panathinaikos. The contract was worth $5,832,000 USD, his buyout from his European club was $400,000 USD.
The contract amount was for an average of $1,944,000 USD per season. The Rockets had acquired the rights to Spanoulis on draft night (June 24, 2004), when Houston swapped draft pick #55 Luis Flores, and cash considerations of $300,000 USD with the Dallas Mavericks, for Spanoulis (pick #50).
“He’s a very versatile ball handler,” Rockets general manager, Carroll Dawson, said. “He’s a good finisher and a very good prospect. He wants to be a great player. Everybody is going to like this young man because he is a very hard-nosed player. We have watched his progress very closely,” Dawson said. “It’s a big adjustment to come to the NBA from Europe, but he is a hard worker.”
Rockets Director of Player Personnel, Dennis Lindsey, stated the following about Spanoulis prior to the team signing him. "We're very, very happy with his progress," said Lindsey. "He changed clubs this year from Maroussi to the bigger club this year, Panathinaikos. For those not familiar with European basketball, they are like the New York Yankees of Greece and one of the two or three better organizations in Europe. They are an NBA level club. From our standpoint, we really like what Vassilis has done. He is their leading scorer. They are 9–1 in the Euroleague and they have already qualified for the top sixteen."
Lindsey praised Spanoulis' offensive ability. "He's got a couple of characteristics that we like," added Lindsey. "He can really drive and get the ball in the paint, and he's relentless with it. He kind of plays basketball like a fullback a little bit, where he just kind of breaks through the line and there's contact on a lot of plays."
"The owner and Jeff and Carroll really like what they've seen so far and we've made a couple of trips over and hopefully in the near future we can have him as a Rocket because we think he can help us."
2006–07 NBA season.
Spanoulis saw limited playing time with the Houston Rockets during his rookie NBA year in 2006–07, averaging 2.7 points and 0.9 assists in 8.8 minutes per game, on 31.9% field goal shooting (17.2% from behind the 3-point line), in 31 games played off the bench.
During Spanoulis' first NBA season, there was a dispute between him and Rockets head coach, Jeff Van Gundy, over playing time. There was an issue between the team's management, Spanoulis, and the coach as well, over the contract that Spanoulis had signed. In order to sign with the Rockets, and fulfill his dreams of playing in the NBA, Spanoulis took a considerably smaller contract than the one that was being offered to him by his Greek team, Panathinaikos Athens. He still had two years under his contract with Panathinaikos, but his buyout was small, and could be paid by the Rockets.
Spanoulis agreed to play for Houston, at a price of $1,944,000 USD gross income per season, for 3 years, passing up on his former team Panathinaikos Athens' much larger offer of €1.6 million euros net income per season, over 3 years, just for a chance of playing in the NBA. Spanoulis made the Rockets' rotation, but eventually, there was a falling out between him and Rockets coach Van Gundy, after Van Gundy benched Spanoulis, after the coach claimed that he had played poorly, citing that rookie players are dangerous for coaches that are in contract years, and that Spanoulis was too turnover prone and lacking in outside shooting touch to be a good fit in Van Gundy's offensive system design. Said Van Gundy about the situation: "(Spanoulis) says, 'I was back home.' Great. McGrady is McGrady here," .. "I feel badly for him. He feels he was misled. Frankly, he's been his own worst enemy in many ways. Some of it is excuses. His turnovers have been high; his fouls have been high; his shooting percentage has been low. I would rather anybody start out with self-evaluation — what can I do better? — versus lash out and blame. Because I'm not playing him now doesn't mean he won't play in the future or we don't feel he could be a good player. I think he's allowed his disappointment to go to discouragement, which has, at times, stunted his improvement. We'll see. We'll see."
Spanoulis was traded by the Rockets, to the San Antonio Spurs, on July 12, 2007, along with a 2009 second-round draft pick, in exchange for center Jackie Butler, and the rights to Argentinian power forward Luis Scola. On August 19, 2007, the Spurs released Spanoulis, giving him the chance to return to Greece to play for Panathinaikos Athens, as he had requested. This was officially announced on August 23, 2007.
Allegedly, due to "family reasons," Spanoulis decided that he would not remain in the NBA, with his agent going as far as, comparing the Rockets reluctance to break his contract to slavery. Spanoulis, instead opted to return to Panathinaikos, to once again play in the Greek Basket League and the Euroleague. 
In June 2013, Spanoulis claimed that Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy told him on the first day he arrived at Houston that since he was a rookie, and unfamiliar to Van Gundy, he would be benched for the season. Spanoulis also claimed that the Houston Rockets' next head coach, Rick Adelman, wanted to keep him, and also that both Tony Parker and Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs were interested in having him on their team.
Back to Panathinaikos Athens.
On August 19, 2007, Spanoulis was released by the San Antonio Spurs, after deciding he wanted to play in Greece during the 2007–08 season. This was due to the fact that his mother was in poor health, and that Spanoulis wanted to be near her. Spanoulis signed a 3-year contract with Panathinaikos, the then defending Euroleague champions. He was signed to play both point guard and shooting guard, along with fellow Greek national team star, Dimitris Diamantidis. Former NBA player, Šarūnas Jasikevičius, would later join them in the team's guard rotation.
The contract Spanoulis signed was for 3-years, at €5,500,000 euros net income salary, plus a $1,166,400 contract buyout from his NBA San Antonio Spurs contract (Panathinaikos paid the buyout, so it did not count against the Spurs' salary cap). Spanoulis' agent set up the contract so that Spanoulis could opt out of it after one year. Spanoulis originally stated that, after the first year of his contract, he might opt out of it and return to San Antonio to play in the NBA again.
During the 2007–08 season, Spanoulis led his team, Panathinaikos, in both points scored (661) and assists (215), over 36 Greek Basket League, and 20 Euroleague games. He averaged 11.8 points per game and 3.8 assists per game for the season, in 56 games total. Spanoulis was the Greek Basket League assists leader. He was voted as a starter to the Greek League All-Star Game, and to the Greek Basket League's Best Five Team.
Spanoulis helped Panathinaikos win the Greek basketball double, as the club won both the Greek Basket League championship, and the Greek Cup in 2008. In the Greek Cup Final, against Panathinaikos' arch-rival Olympiacos, Spanoulis helped to lead his team to the championship cup victory, by scoring 20 points and dishing out 7 assists.
In 2009, Spanoulis led Panathinaikos to the coveted Triple Crown championship, as they won the Euroleague 2008-09 season championship, the Greek League 2008-09 season championship, and the Greek Cup championship, all in the same season. Spanoulis was named the 2009 Euroleague Final Four MVP, and also the 2009 Greek League MVP. Following this season, Spanoulis was named the Balkan Athlete of the Year in 2009, an award given to the best athlete of the Balkans region.
He also won the Greek League 2009-10 season championship with Panathinaikos.
Olympiacos Piraeus.
In July 2010, after much speculation concerning his free agency and his next contract, Spanoulis signed a three-year contract with the Greek Basket League club Olympiacos Piraeus, worth gross income, or net income.
In his first year with Olympiacos, Spanoulis won the Greek Cup, was named to the All-Euroleague Second Team, and was the Greek Basket League assists leader. In 2012, he won both the Euroleague and Greek Basket League championships. He was also named to the All-Euroleague First Team, and won the Euroleague Final Four MVP for the second time in his career. He became the fourth player to win the award multiple times. Furthermore, he once again led the Greek League in assists. Finally, Spanoulis was named the All-Europe Player of the Year in 2012.
Spanoulis was named the Euroleague MVP in 2013. He was also named the 2013 Euroleague Final Four MVP, after once again leading Olympiacos to the Euroleague championship. He became just the second player to win both the Euroleague MVP and the Euroleague Final Four MVP in the same season, along with Dimitris Diamantidis; and he also became just the second player to win the Euroleague Final Four MVP award 3 times, along with Toni Kukoč.
He signed a 3 year contract extension with Olympiacos in July 2013. With Olympiacos, he won the 2013 edition of the world basketball club championship, being named the MVP of the tournament. He was named the All-Europe Player of the Year for the second time in 2013. In May 2014, he was named to the All-Euroleague Second Team of the Euroleague, for the fourth time in his career.

Greece finished in 5th place in the tournament, losing to Manu Ginóbili and the eventual gold-medal winning Argentine national basketball team, 69–64, in the quarterfinals. This was tied for the 2nd highest finish for Greece, in basketball at the Olympics, in its history.

Enrico Albertosi

Enrico "Ricky" Albertosi (born 2 November 1939) is an Italian former footballer who played goalkeeper for the Italian national team in the 1966 World Cup and the 1970 World Cup. 
Born in Pontremoli, Albertosi made his debut for the national team in 1961, a 4–1 victory against Argentina. His final international game took place in June 1972, when Italy drew 1–1 with Bulgaria. 
In 1970 Albertosi was involved in the so-called "Game of the Century", when Italy played Germany. Despite conceding three goals in this match Albertosi won praise for a string of acrobatic saves. He later appeared in the 1970 World Cup Final, where Italy became tournament runners-up as they lost 4–1 to Brazil. 
Albertosi was an unused squad member in the 1962 World Cup and the 1974 World Cup. He was similarly an unused back-up goalkeeper at the 1968 European Football Championship, which Italy won. In all he played 34 times for the national team.
At club level Albertosi represented Spezia, before making his debut in Serie A for Fiorentina in 1959, playing in a goalless draw with A.S. Roma. Albertosi represented Fiorentina until 1968, winning a European Cup Winners' Cup and 2 Coppa Italia. He later transferred to Cagliari Calcio where he won the 1969–70 Scudetto. He later won another championship medal with AC Milan (1978–79), along with another Coppa Italia (1977).
Albertosi was involved with the Italian "Totonero" betting scandal of 1980 and was ultimately suspended for 2 seasons. After winning the 1982 World Cup in Spain, the Italian football federation let him play again. He ended his career playing for Elpidiense (Serie C2), aged 44.

Harmonic (color)

Colors or hues are said to be harmonic if their spacing on the color wheel meets certain criteria. Harmonic colors are said to be color coordinated, and work well together in principles of design and art.
Harmonics refers to the mathematical relationship between different wavelengths, and can be found in any type of wave, from sound waves to waves in the ocean. As an analogy, in music, harmonics can be used to tune a stringed instrument. If two notes, played together, are 1/2 of the wavelength (λ/2) out of sync, the waves will fit perfectly within each other and the note will be a steady sound. These notes are exactly the same, only in different octaves, so the waves form a continuous noise. If the notes are different, the wavelength of each note will be separated by a distance of less than λ/2. When the different notes are played together, they will sometimes reinforce each other, causing constructive interference, and at other times will counteract each other, causing destructive interference. The result is a combined note that has qualities of a wavelength in between. The notes will also have rhythmic oscillations, becoming louder and softer and louder again, caused by the waves falling into phase at regular intervals. These oscillations decrease in frequency as the notes are tuned. At λ/4 the oscillations will occur every fourth wave. However, as the string is tuned toward either λ or λ/2 the oscillations will occur less frequently, until they disappear entirely. At λ/2, the strings are said to be tuned to the second-generation harmonic.
In many respects, light waves behave in a very similar fashion as sound waves. A light wave that is λ/2 shorter than an accompanying light wave will be harmonically in-sync. However, every wave in the visual spectrum is less than λ/2 out of sync with every other wave. For every wave in the visual spectrum, the second-generation harmonic exists outside of the visual range. Therefore, different lightwaves always produce rhythmic oscillations when paired together. For example, 604 nm (orange) is exactly λ/14 shorter than 650 nm (red). Therefore, the oscillations will cycle every fourteenth wave. However, these light waves are too small and occur too frequently to discern any oscillations with the naked eye, although they can be exposed with the use of an optical flat. Typically, the combined interference of the waves will produce a perceived color that is between the two wavelengths, or multiple waves can produce colors that do not exist in the rainbow, such as pink, teal, maroon, or brown.
Colors that are λ/4 out of sync are harmonically opposite from each other. These are colors that usually form blackish hues when mixed as paints, such as green and red, blue and orange, or purple and yellow. These colors are opposites on the color wheel. When mixed as light waves, however (ie: such as pixels in a computer monitor), they will usually form a color in between. For example, when light waves of red and green are mixed, the result is a yellowish-orange light. When all light waves interfere with each other, the result is a harmonic pattern that is nearly random and repeats only after long intervals, forming white light. If a color wheel is attached to a fast motor (or even a twisted rubber band), when spinning the colors on the wheel will appear to turn white.
Harmonics are not just found in the visual spectrum, but occur all throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. These are often utilized by lasers, turning beams of invisible radiation into visible of even ultraviolet radiation. emit beams of infrared radiation at 1064 nm. By using a non-linear crystal, such as potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP), the frequency of the beam can be doubled and its wavelength cut in half, changing it into the second-generation harmonic. Thus, the 1064 beam of the laser can be turned into a green beam at 532 nm. By creating a 2/3 wavelength distance between the waves, the laser can be transformed into its third-generation harmonic, emitting a purple beam at 355 nm. High harmonic generation (HH) produces beams of fourth, fifth, and sixth-generation harmonics, typically making wavelengths shorter than visible, creating high-energy harmonics in the UV to x-ray range.

Belle Grove Plantation (Iberville Parish, Louisiana)

Belle Grove, also known as Belle Grove Plantation, was a plantation and elaborate Greek Revival and Italianate-style plantation mansion near White Castle in Iberville Parish, Louisiana. Completed in 1857, it was one of the largest mansions ever built in the South, surpassing that of the neighboring Nottoway. Nottoway is often cited as the largest antebellum plantation house remaining in the South. The masonry structure stood high and measured wide by deep, with seventy-five rooms (including a jail cell) spread over four floors.
History.
Belle Grove was owned by John Andrews, a wealthy sugar planter originally from Virginia. Andrews owned over spread over several plantations, with Belle Grove having of river frontage. He founded Belle Grove during the 1830s, with Dr. John Phillip Read Stone as a partner. Andrews assumed full ownership in 1844, when the partnership was dissolved. By the 1850s, his more than 150 slaves were producing over half a million pounds of sugar each year.
Andrews built the mansion from 1852 to 1857 at a cost of $80,000, not including the free (slave) labor or the plentiful cypress lumber and hand-made bricks produced on the plantation. The house was designed by New Orleans architect Henry Howard. Andrews had a legendary rivalry with the owner of Nottoway Plantation, John Randolph. This competition even extended to their mansions, with both massive structures designed by Howard in a mix of the Greek Revival and Italianate styles. 
Following the American Civil War and ensuing collapse of the plantation economy, Andrews sold the home and plantation in 1867 to James Ware, for the meager sum of $50,000. The Ware family continued to live and farm the plantation until the early 1920s. After several bad crop years, they were forced to sell the home. From 1925 onwards the house sat vacant.
The post-War era at Belle Grove saw the finely crafted home rot away in Louisiana's harsh environment. Neglect allowed a leaky roof to expand and destroy one wing of the mansion. Several owners purchased the home, each with aspirations of restoration, but none had the means necessary in the lean years of the Great Depression and World War II to stop the onslaught of rapid decay. On March 17, 1952, a mysterious fire during the night destroyed what remained of the house.
Dozens of books have been written regarding Belle Grove's beauty and charm, while hundreds of photographs have been published illustrating those narratives. During the late 1930s a comprehensive set of photographs and architectural drawings were produced for the Historic American Buildings Survey. This material, an inventory of the house's contents made on the death of James A. Ware in 1908, and a drawing of the missing wing, are all available on the website of the Library of Congress.
Famous photographer Clarence John Laughlin described Belle Grove in his work, "Ghosts Along the Mississippi":
When completed, its tremendous mass rose on huge brick foundation arches over twelve feet above the surrounding earth, its walls and mantels were plastered and carved by the most expert European craftsmen money could secure, its great flight of brick steps was covered with imported marble, its door knobs and keyhole guards were of silver, its pillars bore Corinthian capitals six feet high but of the utmost refinement. Its theatrical magnificence would have delighted the Bibiena family - seventeenth century designers of the most elaborate and grandiose stage sets for kings. Yet it was not heavy, or pompous. It managed somehow, to combine vastness with delicacy; titanic proportions with grace and warmth...

Bhayandar

Bhayandar(Marathi: भाईंदर ) is a city in Maharashtra, India, part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. It is in north Mumbai and is governed by the Mira-Bhayandar Municipal Corporation (MBMC). It is also a railway station on the Western Line of Mumbai Suburban Railway.
Like all railway stations on Mumbai suburban railway, Bhayandar is divided into two parts by the rail line: East and West. The West was traditionally residential, and the East was predominantly an industrial area. Another dictinct distribution between East and West Bhayandar is the food. East will provide you a huge range of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes whereas West region offers vegetarian food dominantly. Recent population growth and a flurry of construction has blurred the boundaries between Bhayandar and neighboring Mira Road on the east side of the rail tracks, turning it into a populous suburb. Government-owned salt pans and marshland in West Mira Road have restricted the southward spread of Bhayandar. There is a lot of scope for development of this land as it has the potential to house a gargantuan industrial complex.
The east Indian villages in Bhayandar are Murdha, Rai, Dongri, Uttan, Pali Chowk, Tarodi, etc. They were formed by Portuguese travelers when Vasai (formerly Bassein) was a famous port. One route for "Essel World" is via Gorai, one of the villages close to Bhayandar. Gorai is popular for its beach and nearby Manori beach and is a popular weekend getaway for Bhayandar residents. It also is a great place for meditators who visit the Pagoda.
In the 1970s Bhayandar was a village before the builders converted the fertile farming land into a concrete jungle.
The MBMC's (Mira Bhayandar Municipal Corporation) main office is in Bhayandar (West). Departments like Property Tax, Octroi, Transportation, Health, Ambulance for Emergency, Library, Water, Education, Birth-Death Registration, Tree, Advertising Fee, Animals, Public Construction, City Development, Accounts, etc. are a part of the MBMC's suite.
The recent success of real estate in Mumbai has helped Bhayandar become one of the populated stations on the Western railway circuit. There are trains starting and ending at this station; this shows the growth of Bhayandar in the last decade. Nowadays Mira Bhayandar Municipal Transport (MBMT) bus service are provided which runs in the Mira - Bhayandar city. Mahanagar Gas (MGL) pipeline service is available. Tata Power as well as Reliance Energy has 24-hour electric supply. Multiplex and hyper market called Maxus Mall which includes a six-screen multiplex and Big Bazaar. D-Mart and Sahakari Bhandar have made a mark in the city. Bhayandar has witnessed hike in property rates in a short time and have shown that Bhayandar is coming up as an important destination. The famous residential landmarks are Jesal Park, Sarvoday Paradise, Golden Nest, Indralok in the East side.
There are many hotels in Bhayandar. One of the best is the Veg Sagar near flyover end, Bhayandar west. There are many playing grounds for children such as Netaji SubhashChandra Bose Ground, Agarwal and Maxus cricket ground.
Most recent development has been noticed with regards to hospitals having world class facilities for all.
Schools.
There are many schools. Some of the well-known schools are:

Journal of Women's History

The "Journal of Women's History" is an academic journal founded in 1989. It was the first journal devoted exclusively to the field of international women's history. It explores multiple perspectives of feminism rather than promoting a single unifying form. The journal accepts articles from all timeperiods and geographical regions exploring a wide range of themes relating to women, gender, sexuality, and feminisms. The journal is published quarterly by the Johns Hopkins University Press. Circulation is 684 and the average length of an issue is 200 pages.
The Journal of Women's History moved from the University of Illinois to Binghamton University in June 2010. At Binghamton University, the Journal is currently under the editorship of Professor Jean Quataert and Professor Leigh Ann Wheeler, with Professor Elisa Camiscioli as the Book Review editor and Professor Benita Roth as an associate editor. In 2010 the Binghamton editorial team shifted to online submissions and peer review through the ScholarOne database. The editors have also expressed a goal of including more items focusing on Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East, and they have also made efforts to include articles on the intersection of women's studies with other fields of research including science, law, and queer studies.

Bic Cristal

The Bic Cristal (also known as the Bic pen) is an inexpensive disposable ballpoint pen mass-produced and sold by "Société Bic" of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France.
Background.
In 1945 after the Second World War, Marcel Bich and Edouard Buffard founded "Société PPA" (the French acronym standing for "pens, mechanical pencils and accessories") in Clichy, a suburb north of Paris. During the war Bich had seen a ballpoint pen manufactured in Argentina by László Bíró. Between 1949 and 1950 the Bic Cristal was designed by the "Décolletage Plastique" design team at "Société PPA" (later "Société Bic"). Bich invested in Swiss technology capable of cutting and shaping metal down to 0.01 millimetre, with the outcome a stainless steel, one millimetre sphere which allowed ink to flow freely. After many attempts Bich found a viscosity of ink which neither leaked nor clogged and under a licence from Bíró launched the Cristal in 1950.
Bich invested heavily in advertising, hiring poster designer Raymond Savignac. In 1953 advertising executive Pierre Guichenné advised Bich to shorten his family name to Bic as an easy-to-remember, globally adaptable tradename for the pen, which fit in with product branding trends of the post-war era. Called the "Atomic pen" in France, throughout the 1950s and 1960s the Bic Cristal's ballpoint writing tip and ergonomic design helped change the worldwide market for pens from fountain pens to mostly ballpoints.
In 1959 Bich brought the pen to the American market: the Bic pen was soon selling at 19 cents with the slogan "writes first time, every time." In 1965 the French ministry of education began allowing the use of ballpoint pens in classrooms.
The Bic Cristal is the best selling pen in the world; the 100 billionth was sold in September 2006.
Design.
The Bic Cristal's industrial design has been acknowledged by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City as part of the museum's permanent collection. Its hexagonal shape was taken from the wooden pencil and yields an economical use of plastic along with strength and three grip points giving high writing stability. The pen's transparent polystyrene barrel shows the ink-level. A tiny hole drilled in the barrel's body keeps the same air pressure both inside and outside the pen. The thick ink flows down due to gravity from a tube inside the barrel to feed a ball bearing which spins freely within a brass/nickel silver tip. In 1961 the stainless steel ball was replaced with much harder tungsten carbide which is vitrified by heat, then ground down and milled to an accuracy 0.1 micrometre between spinning plates coated with industrial diamond abrasives. Since 1991 the pen's streamlined polypropylene cap has had a small hole to reduce the risk of suffocation if the cap is inhaled.

The N-Men

The N-Men is a fictional group of superheroes that appeared in the Nickelodeon animated television series "".' The entire group only appeared once, in "The N-Men." In this episode, Jimmy, Sheen, Carl, Libby, and Cindy return from space after miniature golfing on Mercury. The quintet gets settled, and they all do various things. For instance, Carl repeatedly belches, Sheen sits on a vibrator chair, Libby uses vanishing cream, and Jimmy and Cindy arm wrestle. Jimmy also drinks orange juice. The spaceship enters cosmic radiation belts, translating the quintet's most recent activities into superhuman abilities. The N-Men are a spoof of mostly the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, although most members of the team are parodies of various other superheroes who do not belong on either of the respective teams. The only exceptions are Libby, the "Invisible Sister," whose counterpart the Invisible Woman is a member of the Fantastic Four, and Jimmy, whose counterparts the Thing is from the Fantastic Four. However, Jimmy and Cindy both use the battle cry "N-Men, assemble!" which is a parody of the term "Avengers, assemble!"
Upon return from space, each of the kids discovers their abilities, and they fight crime as the N-Men. They are captured by the military and imprisoned, however they break out in order to fight Jimmy, who has become a rampaging monster. However, the group's powers (Jimmy excepted) catch up with them, and they begin to die, but Cindy appeals to the human aspect of Jimmy, and he reverts to his human form in time to finish the formula that would demutate all of them.

Attack surface

The attack surface of a software environment is the sum of the different points (the "attack vectors") where an unauthorized user (the "attacker") can try to enter data to or extract data from an environment. 
Examples of attack vectors.
Examples of attack vectors include user input fields, protocols, interfaces, and services.
Surface Reduction.
The basic strategies of attack surface reduction are to reduce the amount of code running, reduce entry points available to untrusted users, and eliminate services requested by relatively few users. One approach to improving information security is to reduce the attack surface of a system or software. By turning off unnecessary functionality, there are fewer security risks. By having less code available to unauthorized actors, there will tend to be fewer failures. Although attack surface reduction helps prevent security failures, it does not mitigate the amount of damage an attacker could inflict once a vulnerability is found.

Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner

The Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner is a full-size two-door automobile with a retractable hardtop which was produced by the Ford Motor Company in the United States for the model years 1957, 1958 and 1959. Part of the Ford Fairlane range, the Skyliner had a complex mechanism which folded the front of the roof and retracted it under the rear decklid. It had three roof drive motors driving four lift jacks, four door-lock motors, ten solenoids, four locking mechanisms for the roof, and a total of of wiring. The large top took up vast amounts of trunk space, limiting the car's sales (however, unlike what most people believe, the mechanism had decent reliability). Production totaled 20,766 units in 1957, declining to 14,713 in 1958 and to 12,915 in 1959. An electric clock was standard. Fuel consumption was around 14 mpg overall. The fuel tank was placed under the rear seat, which inadvertently added safety in rear collisions.
The wheelbase of the Skyliner was and the overall length was .
During the 1959 model year the Galaxie series was added to Ford’s full-size range and the Skyliner model was absorbed into that series. Although the ’59 Galaxie was designated as a separate series, Galaxies carried both “Fairlane 500” and “Galaxie” badging, on the rear and sides respectively. It came with the standard with the 292CID 2-barrel 200 hp V8.
At the time of its introduction, the Skyliner was the only true hardtop convertible in the world. Today, it has become a very valuable collectible car, with high-point, well-restored examples costing upwards of $73,830 (inc. sales fees Mecum Indianapolis 2013).
Engines and transmissions.
The following engines, all V8s, were available on the Fairlane 500 Skyliner.
Two manual transmissions, a three-speed and three-speed with overdrive, plus three-speed Cruise-O-Matic automatic transmission, were available.
Crestline Skyliner & Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliner.
The Skyliner name had been used by Ford on earlier models, namely the Crestline Skyliner of 1954 and the Fairlane Crown Victoria Skyliners of 1955 and 1956. These models have a two-door hardtop body style with a clear acrylic glass roof panel over the front seats.

Past concerts have featured Janelle Monáe, Art Brut, The Rapture, Son Volt, Lyrics Born, Ladytron, Cut Chemist, Cold War Kids, Nada Surf, Juliette and the Licks, and Pete Yorn.
Wieden+Kennedy's exploration into original programming was started in late 2008 with WK Radio, and subsequently in Fall 2009 with WKEntertainment.
Awards.
Two of the agency's television ads for Nike have won Emmy Awards: "The Morning After," which featured a runner on New Year's Day in 2000, not noticing that every dire Y2K prediction has come to pass; and "Move," which edited seamlessly dozens of athletes and children moving from one sport or activity to another. The Morning After aired in late 1999 and won the Emmy in 2000; Move aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics and won the Emmy that year.
In 2002, the Gunn Report named W+K as the most-awarded agency in the world, and the agency was AdWeek's "Global Agency of the Year" in 2007.
"It's Mine", Wieden+Kennedy's advertisement for Coca-Cola which aired during Super Bowl XLII in 2008, was named as the best Super Bowl commercial of the decade by "Adweek" magazine. The magazine also picked W+K's "Grrr" for Honda as the overall commercial of the decade. Meanwhile, Bob Garfield of "AdAge" added Wieden+Kennedy's "Go Forth" for Levi's as one of the worst ads in 2009.
The next year "Adweek" named them as agency of the year for their work, which included the "The Man Your Man Could Smell Like" campaign for Old Spice.
Both "Creativity" and "AdAge" named Wieden+Kennedy agency of the year for 2010. In 2011, Fast Company named Wieden+Kennedy as one of the 50 most innovative companies.

TM 1517

TM 1517 is a fossilized skull and lower mandible of the species "Paranthropus robustus". It was discovered at Kromdraai, South Africa in 1938 by Robert Broom.
Its characteristics include bony ear tubes positioned below the plane of the cheek bones (more like humans than apes) and a forward set foramen magnum indicating a more erect posture than African apes. In comparison to the genus "Australopithecus", TM 1517 is a bit larger, more robust with a flatter face and smaller canines.

Port of Portland (Maine)

The Port of Portland is the largest tonnage seaport in New England as well as a major seaport along the east coast of the United States. It is also the second largest oil port on the East Coast, processing of oil in 2007, mostly through the Portland-Montreal Pipe Line, and the largest foreign inbound transit tonnage port in the United States.
A ferry company Casco Bay Lines, operated by the Casco Bay Islands Transit District, currently operates ferry services from the Port of Portland to several outlying islands.
From 1970-2008 the Port of Portland was connected by a seasonal (summer only) international ferry service to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. Lion Ferry operated the first vessels on this route, MS "Prince of Fundy" (1970–76), MS "Bolero" (1973-76), and MS "Caribe" (1976–81). CN Marine operated the MV "Marine Evangeline" from 1978-82. Prince of Fundy Cruises and later Scotia Prince Cruises operated the MS "Scotia Prince" from 1983-2004. Scotia Prince was the last ferry operator to use the old city-owned International Marine Terminal before air quality issues resulted in the building being condemned over the winter of 2004-2005. The issue with the terminal building coincided with Scotia Prince Cruises announcing its termination of service on the Portland-Yarmouth route so that no ferry operated on the route in 2005. Bay Ferries began operating the high speed catamaran HSC "The Cat" on the route in 2006 and used the new Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal for the 2008 and 2009 seasons. This service was canceled after the 2009 season.
Portland is the second largest port of call in Maine for cruise ships, after the Port of Bar Harbor, near Acadia National Park. Cruise ships dock at the Ocean Gateway International Marine Passenger Terminal which is currently the largest cruise ship terminal in the state.
The United States Coast Guard patrols the port from stations in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Boothbay Harbor, Maine.

Nonlinear management

Linear management is the application of reductionism to management problems, often relying on the ability to predict, engineer and control outcomes by manipulating the component parts of a business (organization, operation, policy, process and so on). Business process reengineering (BPR) is a popular example of linear management at work. The key defining characteristic of linear management is that order is imposed – usually from above.
However, many argue that such an approach – treating organizations as machines to be engineered in this way – simply doesn't work. Businesses are too complex and too unpredictable. The results of many BPR projects in the 1990s suggests that this argument might be correct.
Nonlinear management (NLM) is a superset of management techniques and strategies that allows order to emerge by giving organizations the space to self-organize, evolve and adapt, encompassing Agile, "evolutionary" and "lean" approaches, flextime, time banking, as well as many others. Key aspects of NLM, including holism, evolutionary design or delivery, and self-organization are diametrically opposite to linear management thinking.

Albert Borgmann

Albert Borgmann (born 1937) is a German-born American philosopher, specializing in the philosophy of technology. He was born in Freiburg, Germany, and is a professor of philosophy at the University of Montana. In 2013 Borgmann received the Golden Eurydice Award.
Philosophy.
"" (1984) contributed to the emerging philosophical discussions of issues surrounding modern technology. Following a Heideggerian viewpoint, Borgmann introduced the notion of the device paradigm to explain what constitutes technology's essence loosely based on Heidegger's notion of Gestell (enframing). The book explores the limitations of conventional ways of thinking about technology and its social context, both liberal democratic ideals and Marxist lines of thought.
"Crossing the Postmodern Divide" (1992) is a techno-religious book characterized in terms of hyperreality and hyperactivity. Hyperactivity is usually described as a pathological syndrome of the child and workaholic, and associated with the familiar symptoms of stress and overwork. Borgmann extends the concept of hyperactivity to society as a whole, and defines it as "a state of mobilization where the richness and variety of social and cultural pursuits, and the natural pace of daily life, have been suspended to serve a higher, urgent cause" (p. 14). Christopher Lasch sees this as a kind of militarization of society – "the suspension of civility, the rule of the vanguard, and the subordination of civilians." Meanwhile critics such as Douglas Kellner have challenged Borgmann's distinction between the real and hyperreal and his denigration of hyperreality as problematic. 
In "Real American Ethics" (2006), distancing himself from both conservative and liberal ideology, Borgmann explores the role of Americans in the making of American values, and proposes new ways for ordinary citizens to improve the country, through individual and social choices and actions.
Borgmann's work has been widely referenced by Catholic theologians, who typically interpret Borgmann's work in support of the position that technology is something to be overcome and that religion, especially some form of Roman Catholism, is to be humanity's saving grace. Meanwhile other Christian writers such as Marva Dawn have drawn on Borgmann's notion of the device paradigm to develop a critique of the church in its capitulation to commodification where worship, for example, becomes a device to attract and please.

Jamestown Glasshouse

The Jamestown Glasshouse is located in Jamestown, Virginia about 1 mile from Jamestown Island, location of the first permanent English settlement, and is a part of the Colonial National Historical Park. 
The original glasshouse was built soon after the first glassblowers (German & Polish) arrived in Jamestown in 1608. A series of small furnaces were built just a few yards away from the current exhibit. A small crew of glassblowers and laborers not only chopped down hardwood trees for fueling the furnace, (sometimes requiring up to 2 weeks to achieve the 2300 degrees needed to melt the basic ingredients-sand, soda ash, potash, & lime), they also collected the ingredients, wood ash, sand, crushed oyster shells, and burned seaweed. Since so much time was required for preparation, it is estimated that actual glassblowing probably only occurred for 5 or 6 days a month. 
The Glassblowers of 1608 were successful in that they were able to send a sample of their glassware home to England, however, operations did not likely survive the "Starving Time", when the colonist population dropped from around 500 to 60.
A second attempt was made around 1621, where four Italian Glassblowers and two assistants were to revive operations. However, this attempt was not productive, due to bad weather, the Indian massacre of 1622, illness, etc. 
It is believed that the furnace was abandoned in 1624.
The current glasshouse was built in the 1970s. The furnace is much larger than the one of 1608, and uses natural gas for fuel; their glass is made from a mix they purchase that is similar to that which was used at the time. Local artists blow glass there daily, as well as explain the art and history of glassblowing at Jamestown. Additional interpreters are available to answer questions.
The glass they make is available for purchase at the gift shop on site.

David Holliday

David Holliday (August 4, 1937March 26, 1999) was an American Broadway actor and television voice actor.
Career.
Stage.
Holliday's longest-running role on Broadway was that of Richard Kiley's alternate as Don Quixote in "Man of La Mancha", playing Don Quixote in matinees and Dr Carrasco in the evening performances, from 1965 to 1971 (and later took on the role of the innkeeper in the 1992 revival). His next performance, as Georges in "Coco", (1969 – 1970) earned him a Theatre World Award. He also appeared in the musicals "Nevertheless They Laugh" (Off Broadway 1971), "Music Is" (1976) and "Perfectly Frank" (1980).
In 1956 Holliday went to New York and auditioned for a part in "West Side Story"; he was given the minor role of Glad Hand, and to understudy Tony, in the London production. He then went on to play the lead role of Tony in the West End, also touring England, Scotland and Scandinavia, reprising this role again in 1963 and 1967 at the St. Louis Municipal Opera House. Holliday had two 1966 London Cast recordings to his credit; one with Jill Martin, and the other with Diane Todd, in the role of Maria. He would spend the next ten years commuting between Britain, Europe, the United States, and South Africa where he toured for six months in the role of Macheath in "The Beggar's Opera".
In 1962 a phone call from, and a subsequent meeting with, British actor-director Noël Coward led to the role of John Van Mier in the London production of "Sail Away" at the Savoy Theatre, London, with Elaine Stritch reprising her Broadway role as Mimi Paragon; the London production ran for 265 performances.
1964 saw Holliday in the lead role of Edward Middleton in "The Wayward Way", the musical version of "The Drunkard", at the New Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith; the cast included Roberta D'Esti as Mary, Jim Dale as William Dowton, Cheryl Kennedy as Agnes Dowton, John Gower as the villainous Squire Cribbs, and Bernard Clifton as the landlord and Arden Rencelaw.
September 1965 saw him at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin, in the role of Dr Seward, in the musical "Dearest Dracula", with John Gower as Dracula, Mary Millar as Lucy, Robert Hornery as Jonathan Harker, David Morton as Sir Arthur Holmwood, and Pitt Wilkinson as Dr Van Helsing.
In 1967, a meeting in New York with Danish actor-director Preben Kaas led to the role of Frank Butler in the Danish version of the musical "Annie Get Your Gun", at the Falconer Theatre in Copenhagen (1967–68), with Daimi Gentle as Annie; this meant an intensive study in phonetics as the role required Holliday singing and speaking in Danish, the success of which can be heard on the Danish Cast recording on Metronome Records HLP 10304 (1968). The production ran for six months.
Later in 1968, and back once more in the United States, Holliday made his Melody Top - Milwaukee Summer Stock Theatre debut in "Fanny" and "Where's Charley". His many lead roles included: Tommy Albright in "Brigadoon", 1973; Carl-Magnus in "A Little Night Music", 1976; Woody Mahoney in "Finian's Rainbow"; Frank Butler in "Annie Get Your Gun" with Jo Anne Worley as Annie, 1982; and Emile De Becque in "South Pacific", 1985. He also appeared many times with the Kenley Ohio Players; some of his roles were: as Tony in "West Side Story" with Anna Maria Alberghetti as Maria; as Robert Baker in "Wonderful Town" with Cloris Leachman as Ruth; as Edward Rutledge in "1776" (musical) with Joel Grey as John Adams; as Bill Sikes in "Oliver!" with Vincent Price as Fagin; as Beverly Carlton in "The Man Who Came to Dinner" with Jack Cassidy as Sheridan Whiteside; as Donald Marshall in "Irene" with Jane Powell in the lead role; and as Karl in "Music in the Air" with Giorgio Tozzi as Bruno.
Some of his non-singing roles include: Henry II in "The Lion in Winter", a 1981 production at Stage Company of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach; Martin Dysart in "Equus", 1982 production at Florida Atlantic University; in England he also toured as Starbuck in "The Rainmaker", and Nick in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?".
Television.
Holliday also had several film and television credits, including the voice of Virgil Tracy, pilot of "Thunderbird 2", in the first series (26 episodes) of "Thunderbirds" (1965–66). Holliday's other television credits include five episodes - aired in May 1973 - of the long-running British soap-opera "Coronation Street", in which he played the character of Tom Schofield, great-nephew of Ena Sharples. Episodes #1286 (14 May), #1287 (16 May), #1288 (21 May), #1289 (23 May), and #1291 (30 May). Episode # 1289 appears on the Coronation Street 1973 Classic 8 Episodes DVD.
Awards.
Holliday was a five-time nominee and four-time winner of the Carbonell Award for Best Actor in Musicals:
1978-79 Season: joint winner "Man of La Mancha",Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre (the other winner was Gregg Baker for "Timbuktu", Theatre of Performing Arts).

The Great Depression (book)

The Great Depression is a book written by Canadian author Pierre Berton. 
The period of time between the stock market crash of 1929 and the outbreak of war in 1939 had a terrible impact on the lives of all Canadians. The book, "The Great Depression" is a scalding indictment of the political leaders of the time, the police, the law and of big business. While successive governments at the Federal, Provincial and Municipal level squabbled over how to deal with the huge numbers of unemployed workers and who would pay for government works programs or “the dole”, tens of thousands of formerly middle class Canadians suffered in abject poverty while drought seared the western prairies and dust clouds blackened the sky. The entire decade became known in Canadian historical parlance as "the dirty thirties." At the nadir of the depression, half the wage earners nationwide were on some form of relief.
The book The Great Depression chronicles, through personal account and historical records, the events of the decade and the impact these events had on Canada and Canadian culture.

Servant songs

The Servant songs (also called the Servant poems or the Songs of the Suffering Servant) are songs in the Book of Isaiah. They were first identified by Bernhard Duhm in his 1892 commentary on Isaiah. The songs are four poems written about a certain "servant of YHWH." God calls the servant to lead the nations, but the servant is horribly abused. The servant sacrifices himself, accepting the punishment due others. In the end, he is rewarded. 
Some scholars regard Isaiah 61:1-3 as a fifth servant song, although the word "servant" is not mentioned in the passage.
Views.
Jewish interpretation.
The traditional Jewish interpretation is that the Servant is a metaphor for the Jewish people, an opinion shared by many contemporary scholars. According to Duhm, the servant was some otherwise unknown individual, and the songs' author was a disciple. Various interpretations have followed: Zerubbabel, Jehoiachin, Moses, Cyrus the Great. Duhm proposed in his commentary that the songs were added by a poet with leprosy. Sigmund Mowinckel suggested that the songs referred to Isaiah himself but later abandoned that interpretation.
However, several ancient rabbinic sources understood Isaiah 53 as referring to the Messiah. Here are quotations from some of them: 
Babylonian Talmud: "The Messiah --what is his name?...The Rabbis say, The Leper Scholar, as it is said, `surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him a leper, smitten of God and afflicted...'" (Sanhedrin 98b) 
Midrash Ruth Rabbah: "Another explanation (of Ruth ii.14): -- He is speaking of king Messiah; `Come hither,' draw near to the throne; `and eat of the bread,' that is, the bread of the kingdom; `and dip thy morsel in the vinegar,' this refers to his chastisements, as it is said, `But he was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities'"
Targum Jonathan: "Behold my servant Messiah shall prosper; he shall be high and increase and be exceedingly strong..."
Zohar: "`He was wounded for our transgressions,' etc...There is in the Garden of Eden a palace called the Palace of the Sons of Sickness; this palace the Messiah then enters, and summons every sickness, every pain, and every chastisement of Israel; they all come and rest upon him. And were it not that he had thus lightened them off Israel and taken them upon himself, there had been no man able to bear Israel's chastisements for the transgression of the law: and this is that which is written, `Surely our sicknesses he hath carried.'" 
Rabbi Moses Maimonides: "What is the manner of Messiah's advent...there shall rise up one of whom none have known before, and signs and wonders which they shall see performed by him will be the proofs of his true origin; for the Almighty, where he declares to us his mind upon this matter, says, `Behold a man whose name is the Branch, and he shall branch forth out of his place' (Zech. 6:12). And Isaiah speaks similarly of the time when he shall appear, without father or mother or family being known, He came up as a sucker before him, and as a root out of dry earth, etc...in the words of Isaiah, when describing the manner in which kings will harken to him, At him kings will shut their mouth; for that which had not been told them have they seen, and that which they had not heard they have perceived." (From the Letter to the South (Yemen), quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 374-5)
Rabbi Mosheh Kohen Ibn Crispin: This rabbi described those who interpret Isaiah 53 as referring to Israel as those: "having forsaken the knowledge of our Teachers, and inclined after the `stubbornness of their own hearts,' and of their own opinion, I am pleased to interpret it, in accordance with the teaching of our Rabbis, of the King Messiah...This prophecy was delivered by Isaiah at the divine command for the purpose of making known to us something about the nature of the future Messiah, who is to come and deliver Israel, and his life from the day when he arrives at discretion until his advent as a redeemer, in order that if anyone should arise claiming to be himself the Messiah, we may reflect, and look to see whether we can observe in him any resemblance to the traits described here; if there is any such resemblance, then we may believe that he is the Messiah our righteousness; but if not, we cannot do so." (From his commentary on Isaiah, quoted in The Fifty-third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters, Ktav Publishing House, 1969, Volume 2, pages 99-114.)
Christian interpretation.
Christians traditionally see the servant as Jesus Christ. Another Christian interpretation combines aspects of the traditional Christian and the Jewish interpretation. This position sees the servant as an example of 'corporate personality', where an individual can represent a group, and vice-versa. Thus, in this case, the servant corresponds to Israel, yet at the same time corresponds to an individual (that is, the Messiah) who represents Israel.
The Songs.
The first song.
The first poem has God speaking of His selection of the Servant who will bring justice to earth. Here the Servant is described as God's agent of justice, a king* that brings justice in both royal and prophetic roles, yet justice is established neither by proclamation nor by force. He does not ecstatically announce salvation in the marketplace as prophets were bound to do but instead moves quietly and confidently to establish right religion. Isaiah 42:1-4
The second song.
The second poem, written from the Servant's point of view, is an account of his pre-natal calling by God to lead both Israel and the nations. The Servant is now portrayed as the prophet of the Lord equipped and called to restore the nation to God. Yet, anticipating the fourth song, he is without success. Taken with the picture of the Servant in the first song, his success will come not by political or military action, but by becoming a light to the Gentiles. Ultimately his victory is in God's hands. Isaiah 49:1-6.
The third song.
The third poem has a darker yet more confident tone than the others. Although the song gives a first-person description of how the Servant was beaten and abused, here the Servant is described both as teacher and learner who follows the path God places him on without pulling back. Echoing the first song's "a bruised reed he will not break," he sustains the weary with a word. His vindication is left in God's hands. Isaiah 50:4-9
The fourth song.
The fourth of the "servant songs" begins at Isaiah 52:13, continuing through 53:12 where it continues the discussion of the suffering servant. There is no clear identification for the "servant" within this song, but if the reader pays close attention to the author's word choice, one can deduce that the song could refer to either an individual or a group. Those that argue the "servant" to be an individual, have "proposed many candidates from Israel's past." The song declares that the "servant" intercedes for others, bearing their punishments and afflictions. In the end, he is rewarded with an exalted position.
On the other hand it is argued that the "servant" represents a group of people, more specifically the nation of Israel, and they feel that they have paid their dues and continue to suffer on behalf of others (Isaiah 53:7,11-12). Also, through the author's choice of words, we, our, and they, one could also argue that the "servant" was a group*. Isaiah 53:1-11 
Early on the evaluation of the Servant by the "we" is negative: "we" esteemed him not, many were appalled by him, nothing in him was attractive to "us". But at the Servant's death the attitude of the "we" changes after verse 4 where the servant bears "our" iniquities, "our" sickness, by the servant's wounds "we" consequently are healed. Posthumously, then, the Servant is vindicated by God. Because of its references to the vicarious sufferings of the servant, many Christians believe this song to be among the Messianic prophecies of Jesus. Isaiah 52:13-53:12 and within the "Jewish tradition the servant was sometimes identified as a messianic figure of the future."

Custom song

Custom songs, or personalized songs consist of a non-songwriter providing information to a songwriter so that the information can then be turned into a piece of music. Unlike the Song poem of the 1960s and 1970s, these songs are more often than not purchased as gifts and do not claim any commercial intentions. The consumer demographic consists mostly of Generation Xers who are trying to be creative in their gift giving. With the Internet, songs can be written, recorded, and sent via email so that the whole process can take very little time.
The spectrum of services provided in this field are broad. Some agencies merely offer a song with a certain theme (e.g. an anniversary or birthday) on a CD with a personalized label. Others are a step up and provide a pre-recorded song with the name of the recipient inserted into the song. The most popular sites; however, offer completely original songs written and recorded from start to finish based on information provided by the customer. Some sites use a specific composer or songwriter to compose the music where others use crowdsourcing by allowing multiple songwriters and composers to compete for the project.
One example is Chris Staples' 2008 EP (under the pseudonym "Discover America") "Songs For Sale," in which he wrote songs put to lyrics submitted by fans.
Prices for a custom song can range anywhere from $99 to several thousands of dollars for premium custom song packages.
An example of a premium custom song package is "YourPremiumCustomSong.com" by Aurelio Sablone, which in addition to a professionally recorded original song, also includes: Song Video, Wooden and Silver Song-Plaque, "Heart-Song" Necklace, Original Framed Handwritten Draft of song lyrics, and Songwriter's Video Commentary of the song.
Additional options can also include a live performance of the custom song at a special event.

Second Maroon War

The Second Maroon War of 1795-1796 was an eight-month conflict between the Maroons of Trelawny Parish, Jamaica, and the British. The other Jamaican Maroon communities did not take part in this rebellion and their treaty with the British still remains in force. An article in the Independent Newspaper dated 21 November 2012 entitled "Duke Vin the Soundman who brought Sound Systems to Britain" is indicative of the treaty remaining in force. It stated that in the late sixties Duke Vin was sent to prison and on his release launched a successful legal process against the Inland Revenue for the return of his taxes as under the terms of the treaty he was tax exempt. Jamaica gained its independence in the early 1960s, therefore the Order in Council (Jamaica Constitution) 1962 did not annul the treaty; moreover, the Maroons of today will tell you that the treaty was a "blood oath" and therefore cannot be annulled. 
The Outbreak of the War.
Maroons felt that they were being mistreated under the terms of Cudjoe's Treaty of 1739, which ended the First Maroon War. The spark of the war was when two Maroons were flogged by a black slave for stealing two pigs. When six Maroon leaders came to the British to present their grievances, the British took them as prisoners. Fighting began in mid-August.
The War.
The war lasted for five months as a bloody stalemate. The British 5,000 troops and militia outnumbered the Maroons ten to one, but the mountainous and forested topography of Jamaica proved ideal for guerrilla warfare. The Maroons surrendered the war in December 1795. The British also had some one hundred bloodhounds and their handlers imported from Cuba.
Aftermath.
The treaty signed in December between Major General George Walpole and the Maroon leaders established that the Maroons would beg on their knees for the King's forgiveness, return all runaway slaves, and be relocated elsewhere in Jamaica. The governor of Jamaica ratified the treaty, but gave the Maroons only three days to present themselves to beg forgiveness on 1 January 1796. Suspicious of British intentions, most of the Maroons did not surrender until mid-March. The British used the contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport the entire Trelawny town Maroons to Nova Scotia. After a few years the Maroons were again deported to the new British settlement of Sierra Leone in West Africa.

Draft Mark Warner movement

The Draft Mark Warner for President committee was an effort to promote the candidacy of former Governor of Virginia Mark Warner. It was founded the day after the 2004 presidential election by Democratic Party activist Eddie Ratliff of Virginia. On October 23, 2007, the Draft Warner for President Committee received a letter from the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in response to the committee's declaration of intent to cease operations, dated October 2, 2007, and was allowed to terminate its affairs and cease filing with the FEC. Warner had announced his intent to become a Senate candidate prior to the committee's letter to the FEC.
History.
Ratliff created the 2004 Virginia for Wesley Clark network and was a lead organizer for Clark’s Virginia ballot initiative. Clark was the last to enter the democratic primary in Virginia and the first on the ballot. Soon after the website, http://www.draftmarkwarner.com was created, Ratliff was joined by Steve Deak and Eddie Hartman who were also initial Co-Founders of the draft movement. Steve Deak was a Loudoun County Democratic Party Chair and County Coordinator for Gov. Warner’s 2001 campaign, and became the Southern Regional Director for Draft Mark Warner committee. Hartman, a partner at LegalZoom, worked on efforts in Southern California. Delegate Onzlee Ware, of the Virginia House of Delegates and PR professional Mike Smith served as the Official DMW Spokespersons. 
After the election of Governor Tim Kaine in November 2005, the committee had activity in dozens of states, conducting events nationwide. On March 9th, 2006 the Draft Mark Warner filed papers with the Federal Elections Commission and officially became the Draft Mark Warner for President PAC. Terry Frye, the Bristol, Virginia Commissioner of Revenue serves as the PAC's Treasurer along with Virginia Democratic Activist Joan Baker Washburn as the Assistant Treasurer. 
Draft Mark Warner started its on-the-ground operations at the West Virginia Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson Dinner on April 27th, 2005. Since that time, the group has organized dozens of events nationwide publicizing the candidacy of Governor Warner and helping to up his name recognition.
When Gov. Warner announced his decision to not run in '08, the Draft committee had state & congressional directors in 39 states, along with affiliated groups such as Young Americans for Warner, Veterans for Warner, and Americans Abroad for Warner,
After becoming a political action committee, Draft Mark Warner raised the funds necessary to conduct events nationwide, attending such events as the National Young Democrats Convention, the National Federation of Democratic Women Convention, the National College Democrats Convention, the first Yearly KOS Convention (Las Vegas), and many others. 
The PAC started its fundraising campaign in Virginia, by gaining the endorsements of key business and legislative leaders to serve as Honorary Chairs in each region of the Commonwealth. These key officials lent credibility to the PACs goals and were instrumental in hosting events, raising money, making news, and promoting Gov. Warner's run for the White House.
Former State Senator Madison Mayre served as Honorary Chairman of the Draft in Southwest Virginia. Northern Virginia Honorary Chairs included Delegate Brian Moran (46th District), State Senator Richard S, Saslaw (35th District), and State Senator Mary Margaret Whipple (Chair of the Senate Democratic Causus). Richmond businessman and former Delegate R.S. (Major) Reynolds III, State Senator Henry Marsh III, and Delegate Frank Hall were named Honorary Co-Chairs of the greater Richmond Area. Delegate David E. Poisson served in Central Virginia.
Young Americans for Warner.
Young Americans for Mark Warner, was established in February 2006, in affiliation with Draft Mark Warner. YAFW kicked off their movement in March 2006 at the North Carolina Young Democrats State Convention, and have been working events like the Young Democrats Conventions, College Democrat Conventions, and other local and statewide Young Democrats events. YAFW currently has Coordinators in several states and the movement is growing rapidly. They are also in the process of creating a website http://www.yafw.com which will be online soon.
New Jersey Democratic Activist Marshall Spevak serves as National Chairman of YAFW, and is also the founder.
Governor Warner's decision.
When Governor Warner decided against seeking the Democratic nomination for President, Draft Mark Warner and Young Americans for Warner kept the PAC active until October 2007, while Gov. Warner pondered his political future. 
After Gov. Warner announced his U.S. Senate run, on the eve of the January '08 Iowa caususes, the leadership of the Draft group issued a press release endorsing the presidential candidacy of U.S. Senator Barack Obama. Former key Draft Warner organizers from more than a dozen states began to work to elect Senator Obama.
Draft Mark Warner co-founders Eddie Ratliff and Steve Deak, are profiled in author David Meerman Scott's July '07 book "The New Rules of PR & Marketing." Scott previously profiled Matthew Gross (who headed internet operations for Howard Dean's 2004 campaign) in his book "Cashing in with Content."

German submarine U-961

German submarine "U-961" was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. "U-961" was constructed at Hamburg during 1942 and 1943, completing her working-up cruises in the Baltic Sea in the spring of 1944. Due to extensive modifications and shortages of supplies during her construction and training, "U-961" took nearly two years to be ready for active service, an exceptionally long time.
War patrol.
"U-961" departed on her only war patrol on the 23 March 1944, under the command of Kptlt. Klaus Fischer, a veteran submariner. After leaving Marviken at Kristiansand in Norway, "U-961" headed directly for the North Atlantic Ocean, the main battleground of the Battle of the Atlantic. By 1944 however, the region had become a U-boat graveyard, as drastic improvements in submarine detection and destruction had been made, both by surface shipping and by allied aircraft.
Fate.
The patrol lasted just seven days, ending suddenly and brutally during an attack on convoy JW 58 north of the Faroe Islands on the 29 March. As "U-961" approached the convoy, she was discovered underwater by the detection equipment on the convoy escort and immediately destroyed with depth charges, at position . The boat never even managed to surface, sinking to the bottom with all 49 sailors on board.

Saint Aredius (c. 510–591), also known as Yrieix, was Abbot of Limoges and chancellor to Theudebert II, King of Austrasia in the 6th century. He founded the monastery of Attanum, and the various French communes called St. Yrieix are named after him.
Legend.
He was the son of Jocundus, a wealthy Roman. As a young boy he was sent to monastery at Vigeois to study. At the age of 14, he was sent to Metz, under Theudebert. He became the chancellor. Aredius left the court, where life was dissolute, to join Nicetius, bishop of Trier. He converted to Christianity; when he was singing psalms, a dove came down from the sky and flew around him, Aredius tried to shoo it away, but this one was placed above his head. The dove remained with Aredius during thirty days. When his father died, he joined his mother Pelagia in a villa in Attanum (Attane).

Hearts of Oak (play)

This article is about the play by Herne and Belasco, for other uses see Hearts of Oak (disambiguation).
Hearts of Oak is an 1879 play by Americans James Herne and David Belasco taken from the British play,"The Mariner's Compass", by Henry Leslie (1830-1881).
Hearts of Oak.
The play is a melodrama concerning a woman who marries her guardian out of gratitude, even though she loves another man. It was extraordinarily successful on tour, starring Belasco, and earning a fortune for him. "Hearts of Oaks" first opened as a five act and six tableaux production at the Hamlin's Theatre in Chicago on November 17, 1879. The actress Chrystal Herne was named after the character her mother, Katherine Corcoran, portrayed in the piece. The play's title is a quotation from a line spoken in Homer's "Odyssey" by Circe to Odysseus upon his return from the underworld , ""Hearts of oak, did you go down/ alive into the homes of death? One visit/ finishes all men but yourselves, twice mortal!""
Reviews.
The Daily Globe, St. Paul, Minnesota – January 23, 1882
The Hearts of Oak company began an engagements of four performances at Leubrie’s theater last night. They may be congratulated. The company has been improved and strengthened since last season and is now equal to any presenting dramas of like character on the road. Jas. A Hearne (sic) who replaces Frank Aiken as Terry Dennison is a type of the simple sailor who sacrifices his own hopes for happiness of the object of his love. His acting is spirited and perfect in keeping with the character. The strength of his love for Chrystal shown in his discovery of the affection existing between her and Ruby is faithfully and strongly portrayed. And in the scene with his child, to whom he dares not make himself known, his acting is worthy of the warmest praise. The restraint that his noble self-denying heart places as the barrier between himself and the fruition of his parental love – the blind man casting off for others all hope for the future in the care for wife and child was true to nature in delineation though unfortunately too elevated for nature in fact. Harry Mainhal was an excellent Ruby Darell and Catherine Corcoran a charming and natural Chrystal. Mr. Charles H. Clark (Uncle Davy) and F. Chippendale (Owen Garroway) deserve favorable mention. The Latter in the supper scene aroused a storm of laughter by his vicarious hospitality and awkwardness
The Michigan Argonaut, March, 1883
Herne's "Hearts of Oak" drew one of the largest audiences of the season at the Opera House Wednesday evening. The play is well named for surely none, but Hearts of Oak could stand the intense strain which finally did cause one heart to break. The shipwrecked orphan-girl in real life, who marries her protector out of a sense of duty, though desperately in love with one more equal in age, is an extremely rare and interesting object. The company was good from first to last. Herne, as Terry Dennison, played an unexceptional role. Miss Corcoran as Crystal, did justice to a difficult part, and was especially effective in the scene in the grave with Ruby. Uncle Davy and Aunt Betsey, ably assisted by Owen Garroway, caused many cunning side scenes which served to relieve the deep melancholy that pervades the whole play. Little Maud Thompson as Little Crystal is a "daisy," and we predict a brilliant future for her. The scenic effects, especially in the wreck scene, demand a large stage for their best representation, but were quite effective. The play does not follow the canons of Horace, having six acts. The interludes were rather too long, but the audience endured them each time with sweet anticipation of the treat to follow.

Brookville (band)

Brookville is a solo project of Andy Chase from Ivy. Brookville toured the United States in November 2006 with pop band Tahiti 80.
Bio.
Ivy co-founder Andy Chase released Brookville's second album, "Life in the Shade", on June 13, 2006, on his own label, Unfiltered Records. The album was recorded in New York at Stratosphere Sound, which is co-owned by Chase, Adam Schlesinger (Fountains of Wayne, Ivy) and James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins, A Perfect Circle). "Life in the Shade" is the follow-up to 2003's critically acclaimed "Wonderfully Nothing". Characterizing Brookville as a way to scratch a creative itch he can't quite reach with his other projects, including Paco, singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist/producer Chase explains, "As an artistic experience, it's incredibly satisfying, and I don't think there's anything closer to my heart."
Iha and Schlesinger contributed performances to the album, a highly collaborative effort that owes much of its easy-to-get-lost-in sonic depth to Cyril Moisson. The Paris-based sound editor, who is one of Chase's closest friends, lent his prowess as a multi-instrumentalist and brought his expertise in composition, programming and production to the proceedings as well. Other guests include Fountains of Wayne guitarist Jody Porter, Eric Matthews (trumpet, flugelhorn, vocals) and members of the Brazilian Girls (Didi Gutman and Sabina Sciubba). Greg Pliska (Hem) arranged and conducted much of the album's gorgeous, transporting string passages. Chase, meanwhile, shared mixing duties with Steve Osborne (the Cure, New Order, Doves).
"I'm singing on this album, and as a result there's so much freedom in the writing," Chase says. "With Ivy, Dominique is my muse but also my mouthpiece; I write lyrics that she feels represent her, and that means exploring more universal experiences. In that setting I'm also co-writing with Adam, so, in a sense, my original creative impulses have to go through two security checks, and that can be frustrating. Brookville allows me to be completely uncensored. There are no compromises. It's a bit cathartic, and the results are very personal, very specific to me."
To be sure, Brookville's thematic preoccupations are uniquely Chase's. Yet he's quick to acknowledge his collaborators. He credits Moisson with, among other things, "having these wonderfully strange influences." "Cyril's really into French composer Erik Satie," Chase says, "and a lot of obscure European music I don't know. He keeps everything interesting." Moisson, in turn, praises Chase: "Andy is very reactive and very quick ... he can take small elements of your work and turn it into a basic song in a few minutes. He's always positive about propositions, so you feel comfortable to experiment and you can trust him to keep the best parts."
"Working on material for Brookville is one of the most intuitive things I do," Chase says. "It allows me to follow every path I start down. The final result is as close as I can possibly come to realizing what was in my head when I conceived these things. That's why this music is so important to me. Then again, sometimes I think it's just a pretext for Cyril and I to hang out."
Brookville toured with Goldfrapp in support of "Wonderfully Nothing".
Chase released his third Brookville album, "Broken Lights", in September 2009.

Henry Spencer (Psych)

Henry William Spencer, Jr. is a fictional character on the American television dramedy "Psych". He is played by American actor Corbin Bernsen.
Fictional biography.
A retired police officer, Henry Spencer raised his only son, Shawn, to follow in his footsteps, schooling him in detective work from a young age. The character is based loosely on series creator Steve Franks' father, a police officer who wanted his son to choose a similar career path. He would sometimes try to hone Franks' observational skills by asking how many people were wearing hats in a restaurant, a tactic which Henry employs with Shawn in the series pilot.
In the penultimate episode of the second season (), Chief Vick set Henry up with her friend Susan "Sue B." from the Mayor's office (played by Corbin Bernsen's wife, Amanda Pays).
He's the son of Henry Spencer, Sr., played by Brian Doyle Murray, and followed his father's footsteps in becoming a detective, but does not seem to get along with him, and is estranged from his younger brother, Jack Spencer, played by Steven Weber. In "Psych's Guide to Crime Fighting for the Totally Unqualified" it's revealed that Shawn's Grandma Emma (Henry's mom) is still alive
In the 14th episode of the fourth season, "Think Tank", Police Chief Karen Vick offered Henry a job as police liaison between the SBPD and its external divisions (mainly Shawn's psychic detective agency). Henry initially declined the job offer, preferring retired life but later accepted it in the season four finale, while pursuing the serial killer Mr. Yin.
After solving one of his old cases in the season 6 finale, Henry turns down Chief Vick's offer to rejoin the department as a Detective and that he won't stay on in his current position, to the surprise of Shawn who seems to finally come to understand and (re)respect his father, saying that he is ready for retirement and that he has lost respect for the badge because his friends had been dirty cops and sabotaged his case years before. After leaving the police station he then goes to the house of a friend who had worked with him at the time of the case to tell him about what the other two friends had done, after Henry discovers that the last friend was involved as well, the old friend then shoots Henry so that knowledge of his involvement won't spread.
It is revealed in the Season Seven premiere that Henry survived the gunshot after undergoing surgery to remove the bullet, though he spent the entirety of the episode in the hospital. In Season Eight, he becomes a professor in criminology and in the series finale, helped Shawn solve his case, also bring his class.
Characterization.
Actor Corbin Bernsen describes Henry as "a guy who's very, very disciplined. He always has been disciplined. He believes order is what gets you through the day … The dynamic of the guy is that, though, his own order torments him and when he breaks his rules it drives him nuts, and he probably takes it out on Shawn."
Henry is disappointed by Shawn's unwillingness to conform to his ideals, and when the series begins the two appear to have been estranged for some time, to the point that Shawn is unaware that Henry has moved back to Santa Barbara. As the show progresses, the two begin to mend their relationship.
Bernsen says that, with Henry's career now behind him and his wife out of his life (he was divorced in 1992), Shawn is essentially the only family he has left, making him more willing to accept his son despite a lingering disappointment. Although Henry expresses disdain at Shawn's new career as a psychic detective, expressing his deep dislike of both private investigators and psychics, he appears to be secretly proud of his son's investigational skills and saves newspaper articles concerning Shawn's exploits.
Bernsen notes that Shawn is "being everything I want him to be, but he's not being it my [Henry's way," making Shawn's work a source of both pride and frustration.

Rockdust

Rock dust, also known as rock powders, rock minerals, rock flour, soil remineralization, and mineral fines, consists of finely crushed rock, processed by natural or mechanical means, containing minerals and trace elements widely used in organic farming practices.
The igneous rocks basalt and granite often contain the highest mineral content, whereas limestone, considered inferior in this consideration, is often deficient in the majority of essential macro-compounds, trace elements, and micronutrients.
Rock dust is not a fertilizer, for it lacks the qualifying levels of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.
Background.
Soil remineralization creates fertile soils by returning minerals to the soil which have been lost by erosion, leaching, and or over-farming. It functions the same way that the Earth does: during an Ice Age, glaciers crush rock onto the Earth's soil mantle, and winds blow the dust in the form of loess all over the globe. Volcanoes erupt, spewing forth minerals from deep within the Earth, and rushing rivers form mineral-rich alluvial deposits.
Rock dust is added to soil to improve fertility and has been tested since 1993 at the Sustainable Ecological Earth Regeneration Centre (SEER Centre) in Straloch, near Pitlochry, in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Further testing has been undertaken by James Cook University, Townsville, Far North Queensland.
Research.
SEER's research claims that the benefits of adding rockdust to soil include increased moisture-holding properties in the soil, improved cation exchange capacity and better soil structure and drainage. Rockdust also provides calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium, plus trace elements and micronutrients. By replacing these leached minerals it is claimed that soil health is increased and that this produces healthier plants.
Silicon is thought to be the major element effecting the strength of cell wall development. However it is the amount of available silica that has a dramatic effect on the plant strength and subsequent health. To highlight this, plants that are grown in very sandy soils, (being high in non available silica), often require a silica based fertiliser to provide available silicon.
Silicon comes in silicon multi-oxide molecules (e.g. SiO2, SiO4, SiO6, SiO8 etc.). Each molecule shape is thought to pack in different ways to allow different levels of availability.
Often phosphorus is locked in soils due to many years of application of traditional fertilisers. The use of micronutrient rich fertiliser enables plants to access locked phosphorus.
The elements high in available 2+ valence electrons, calcium, iron and magnesium in particular contribute to paramagnetism in soil which aid in cation exchange capacity.
The calcium and magnesium in high quality has the ability to neutralise pH in soils, in effect acting as a liming agent
Rockdust can be applied to soil either via hand application, via Broadcast spreader or fertigation. Where possible the rockdust can be worked into the ground either physically or by using water to wash in.
In some soils which display poor levels of nutrients, application rates of 10 tonnes per hectare are required. In Australia, namely the Riverland, Riverina, Langhorne Creek, Barossa and Mclaren Vale regions, rates are 3–5 tonnes per hectare. In a garden application, this might equate to 400 grams per square metre.
Rockdust is also the limestone-based product sprayed on walls inside underground coal mines to keep coal dust levels down. This is to prevent coal dust explosions and also to prevent the incidence of black lung disease.
History.
Rockdusting, also known as soil remineralization, was mentioned in the 19th century book "Bread From Stones" by chemist Julius Hensel.
In the 20th century, rockdusting was popularized by science writers John D. Hamaker, Larry Ephron, Alden Bryant, Don Weaver, Harvey Lisle, Arden Andersen and Dr. Lee Klinger. Dr. Klinger uses remineralization through rock dust to restore ailing trees.

Open Archival Information System

An Open Archival Information System (or OAIS) is an archive, consisting of an organization of people and systems, that has accepted the responsibility to preserve information and make it available for a Designated Community.
The term OAIS also refers, by extension, to the ISO OAIS Reference Model for "an" OAIS. This reference model is defined by recommendation CCSDS 650.0-B-1 of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems; this text is identical to ISO 14721:2003. The CCSDS's purview is space agencies, but the OAIS model it developed has proved useful to a wide variety of other organizations and institutions with digital archiving needs.
The information being maintained has been deemed to need "long term preservation", even if the OAIS itself is not permanent. "Long term" is long enough to be concerned with the impacts of changing technologies, including support for new media and data formats, or with a changing user community. "Long term" may extend indefinitely. In this reference model there is a particular focus on digital information, both as the primary forms of information held and as supporting information for both digitally and physically archived materials. Therefore, the model accommodates information that is inherently non-digital (e.g., a physical sample), but the modeling and preservation of such information is not addressed in detail. As strictly a conceptual framework, the OAIS model does not require the use of any particular computing platform, system environment, system design paradigm, system development methodology, database management system, database design paradigm, data definition language, command language, system interface, user interface, technology, or media for an archive to be compliant. Its aim is to set the standard for the activities that are involved in preserving a digital archive rather than the method for carrying out those activities.
The acronym OAIS should not be confused with OAI, which is the Open Archives Initiative.
The reference model.
The reference model:
Requirements of the system.
The reference model (ISO 14721:2003) includes the following responsibilities that an OAIS archive must abide by:
The OAIS Environment and Information Model.
The OAIS environment involves the interaction of four entities: producers of information, consumers of information (or the Designated Community), management, and the archive itself. The management component of the OAIS environment is not an entity that carries out day-to-day maintenance of an archive but a person or group that sets policies for the content contained in the archive.
The OAIS model also defines an information model. Physical or digital items which contain information are known as data objects. Members of the Designated Community for an archive should be able to interpret and understand the information contained in a data object either because of their established knowledge base or with the assistance of supplementary "representation information" that is included with the data object.
An information package includes the following information objects:
There are three types of information package in the OAIS reference model: 
These three information packages may or may not be identical to each other.
The Functional Model.
There are five functional entities in an OAIS:
Widespread Adoption.
Although originally developed by the CCSDS, a body dedicated to overseeing space agencies, as digital preservation has become a discipline unto itself, the OAIS has become the standard model for digital preservation systems at many institutions and organizations. OAIS-compliance has been a stated fundamental design requirement for major digital preservation and repository development efforts at the National Archives and Records Administration, Library of Congress, British Library, Bibliothèque nationale de France, National Library of the Netherlands, the Digital Curation Centre in the UK, OCLC (the Online Computer Library Center), the JSTOR (Journal Storage) scholarly journal archive, as well
as several university library systems. The OAIS has been the basis of numerous prominent digital preservation initiatives and standards including the working group and the Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification (TRAC) document from OCLC.

Bus Conductor

Bus Conductor is Malayalam film directed by V. M. Vinu.
Mammootty plays the male protagonist/hero. The film also stars Adithya, Jayasurya, Bhavana, Nikita Thukral, Mamta Mohandas, Innocent, Salim Kumar, Harisree Ashokan, etc.
Plot.
The story, set in the Malabar culture, revolves around Zakir Hussain aka Kunjakka (Mammootty). This bus conductor lords over the family that has a motley cast to it - mother (Bindu Panicker), sister (Poornima), her husband (Innocent), son (Jayasurya), daughters and his own sister Selina (Mamta Mohandas). Then there are his bus mates (Kalpana and Harisree Ashokan)and the villain police sub inspector Adithya
Being a good man, Kunjakka is faced with all kinds of troubles and responsibility. On the one hand he has to take on the wily cop (Adithya), who also runs a bus company on the sly. Then the problems within the family come to hand. Najeeb’s (Jayasurya) dalliance with a local girl (Bhavana) ends in her becoming pregnant. But Najeeb goes to Dubai leaving the girl in the lurch. So the responsibility of looking after her also falls on Kunjakka’s shoulders. There are misunderstandings in the family and his only solace is Noorjahan (Nikita Thukral).
The story then is about how Kunjakka unties all the knots of distrust and disappointments.
It is a story that is overweighed by treacle-soaked sentiments. In fact, the maudlin nature of the script makes you groan. Starting with Mammooty none of the artistes have let down the story. Every one chips in efficiently. But the director Vinu has chosen the wrong path. He gets himself tied up through over-the-top sentiments.
Music is by M. Jayachandran.

Peanut paste is a product of peanuts and is used as an ingredient in sauces, cookies, crackers (and other baked goods), breakfast cereals and ice cream.
Peanut paste is the main ingredient of peanut butter.
Method.
Peanut paste is obtained by several methods of known in the food arts in which raw peanuts are roasted, blanched, and ground to create the peanut paste.
On the other hand, peanut butter comprises of peanut paste as well as a stabilizing agent, a sweetening agent, salt, and optionally, an emulsifying agent. Peanut butter is mainly known for being sold as a spread, and peanut paste is regularly sold to be used as an ingredient in cookies, cakes and a number of other retail food products.
Distinction from peanut butter.
A number of peanut paste products have been used over the centuries, and the distinction between peanut paste and peanut butter is not always clearcut in ordinary use.
The term has been used in rural Queensland, Australia as a synonym for peanut butter. This followed pressure from dairy farmers who did not want peanut butter competing with butter for market share.
The product was known in Western Australia for many years as peanut paste because, by definition, 'butter' is a dairy product. The same product was available in other states - presumably Queensland excepted - as peanut butter. Manufacturers complained about having to produce different labels for different states and the Western Australian government changed the rules on the use of the word 'butter' to allow for one set of labels.
As ingredient of peanut butter.
Generally, peanut paste acts as the main ingredient in peanut butter, from 75% to as much as 99% of the recipe.

Bevilacqua is a "comune "with 1,927 inhabitants in the province of Verona, Italy.
History.
The Comune di Bevilacqua began as a settlement of ancient Venetic people on the banks of the Adige River, documented to 589 AD. The fortification of this settlement eventually came to be known as the Bevilacqua Castle, located in the Principality of Bevilacqua established on May 7, 1059.
In the 14th century, Count Guglielmo Bevilacqua began a restoration and expansion of the castle, completed by his son Francesco. In 1532, Count Gianfrancesco Bevilacqua commissioned Michele Sanmicheli to completely renovate the medieval building and convert it into a villa with a new and more comfortable interior. In 1756, Count Gaetano Ippolito Bevilacqua renovated part of the castle. After damage caused during the Napoleonic wars at the beginning of the 19th century, the castle was set on fire by Austrian troops in 1848. After 1860, Baroness Felicita La Masa Bevilacqua had the castle renovated in successive stages. The external walls were decorated with merlons and the entire building acquired a neo-gothic savour in line with the romantic spirit of that time.
In 1932, the family donated the castle to the Italian state and commissioned Engineer Eleuterio Mutto's design for converting the castle into a nursing home ("Asilo di Quiete Bevilacqua-La Masa"). In 1945 the castle was entrusted to the Salesian Society, who used it as a boarding school until 1966. In 1980, the castle underwent a total restoration program aimed at the architectural recovery of the magnificence of the 16th century.
Main sights.
The Bevilacqua Castle is between Padova and Verona and from Montagnana; it has been meticulously maintained and restored and is open to visitors. The external medieval architecture encloses a 16th-century interior ascribed to the famous architect Michele Sanmicheli. The first floor offers room to accommodate up to 500 guests and is surrounded on three sides by a hanging garden. The internal court, with its porticos, offers additional room for buffets or special evenings. The Bevilacqua Castle also hosts a standing exhibition of antique furniture.

Borough status in the United Kingdom

Borough status in the United Kingdom is granted by royal charter to local government districts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The status is purely honorary, and does not give any additional powers to the council or inhabitants of the district. In Scotland, similarly chartered communities were known as royal burghs, although the status is no longer granted.
Origins of borough status.
Until the local government reforms of 1973 and 1974, boroughs were communities possessing charters of incorporation conferring considerable powers, and were governed by a municipal corporation headed by a mayor. The corporations had been reformed by legislation beginning in 1835 (1840 in Ireland). By the time of their abolition there were three types:
Many of the older boroughs could trace their origin to medieval charters or were boroughs by prescription, with Saxon origins. Most of the boroughs created after 1835 were new industrial, resort or suburban towns that had grown up after the industrial revolution. Borough corporations could also have the status of a city.
For pre-1974 boroughs, see Municipal Corporations Act 1835, Boroughs incorporated in England and Wales 1835–1882, Unreformed boroughs in England and Wales 1835–1886, Boroughs incorporated in England and Wales 1882–1974, Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840
Modern borough status.
England and Wales.
Outside Greater London, borough status is granted to metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts under the provisions of section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972. This section allows the council of a district to petition the monarch for a charter granting borough status. The resolution must have the support of at least two-thirds of the councillors. Having received the petition the monarch may, on the advice of the Privy Council, grant a charter whereupon:
Charters granted under the 1972 Act may allow the borough council to appoint "local officers of dignity" previously appointed by an abolished borough corporation. Examples include:
There is no obligation on the council to appoint persons to these positions.
In some boroughs the mayor has the additional title as "Admiral of the Port", recalling an historic jurisdiction. The Lord Mayors of Chester and Kingston-upon-Hull are Admirals of the Dee and the Humber respectively, the Mayor of Medway is Admiral of the River Medway, and the Mayors of Poole and Southampton are Admirals of those ports.
Privileges or rights belonging to citizens or burgesses of a former borough can be transferred to the inhabitants of the new borough.
Borough councils are permitted to pass a resolution admitting "persons of distinction" and persons who have "rendered eminent service" to be an honorary freeman of the borough. This power has been used to grant freedom not only to individuals, but to units and ships of the armed forces.
England.
Borough charters granted under section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972 to metropolitan and non-metropolitan districts of England 
Greater London is divided into thirty-two London boroughs. Their borough status dates from 1965, although each of them had previously included municipal, county or metropolitan boroughs:
Wales.
Borough charters granted under section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972 to Welsh districts
The districts created in 1974 were abolished in 1996 by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994. The 1994 Act amended section 245 of the Local Government Act 1972, allowing for the new unitary county councils established by the Act to apply for a charter in a similar manner to the old district councils. On receiving a charter a county became a "county borough".
Welsh unitary authorities granted a charter in 1996 bestowing county borough status
Northern Ireland.
Since 1973, Northern Ireland has been divided into twenty-six local government districts. Under the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 districts can have borough status either by adopting the charter of a pre-1973 municipal or county borough, or by applying for a charter granting the status. It is intended that the planned reform of local government, creating eleven larger districts, will have similar provision for inheriting borough status. The privileges of borough status are that the council chairperson is called "mayor" and up to one quarter of councillors can be called "alderman".

Battle of Węgierska Górka

The Battle of Węgierska Górka was a two-day-long defence of a Polish fortified area in south of Silesia during the opening stages of the Polish Defensive War of 1939.
Although the Polish position was not completed and only five bunkers were manned, the line was defended for two days and nights against superior German forces of the German 7th Infantry Division. One of the bunkers was successfully evacuated by the Polish 1st Mountain Brigade, but the others lacked radio receivers and did not receive the order to retreat. Eventually, the Germans managed to break through the Polish positions, but with heavy casualties on their side and with a significant delay.
History.
Before the battle.
Following the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Poland's southern border became vulnerable to a possible German invasion. Because of that, in April 1939 the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces dispatched Col. Tadeusz Zieleniewski to prepare plans of fortifications along the border to cover the southern flank of the Kraków Army in case of an armed conflict with Nazi Germany. The plan assumed creation of four major fortified areas sealing all four river valleys in the area. The Soła valley was to be blocked by 20 large bunkers located around the village of Węgierska Górka, the Koszarawa was to be sealed in Korbielów, Krzyżowa and Przyborów, the Skawa shielded in Bystra and Jordanów, while the Raba River valley was to be defended by bunkers built in Raba Niżna. The plan was accepted on 24 June and the construction at Węgierska Górka and Korbielów started almost immediately, in early July.
The bunkers around Węgierska Górka were to form a crescent-shaped defensive position guarding the village and the town in the valley between the hills of over 1000 metres of altitude. All works were carried out by a mobilized unit of Work Battalions led by Major Śliwiński, with civilians forbidden to enter the construction area. The bunkers were of different types, but all of them were large, able to house at least one anti-tank gun, several heavy machine guns and a crew of up to 20 soldiers. The walls and ceilings were made of reinforced concrete mixed with dense porphyry rocks, which added to their impregnability. All bunkers in the area had code-names starting with the letter W. Despite the plans, in less than two months only five bunkers were more or less ready. On 1 September 1939, at the moment of the German invasion, only four were manned: Wędrowiec ("Traveller"), Wąwóz ("Gorge"), Waligóra (Mountaincracker - name of a folk tale hero) and Włóczęga ("Hobo"). The fifth one, Wyrwidąb (also named after a folk tale hero) had to be abandoned due to lack of crews. The remaining 15 bunkers were at different stages of construction and most of them were little more than concrete foundations.
The four bunkers were also only provisionally prepared. All of them lacked heavy machine gun (HMG) cupolas that were to be mounted on top of the ceilings to cover the battlefield with machine gun fire. There was neither electricity nor telephone network and the only means of communication were "signal pipes", steel tubes with reflectors for Morse code communication, completely unusable in the dense smoke of the battle. The lack of electricity also resulted in the crew resorting to usage of kerosene lamps and candles, while the electric water pumps were not operational at all. Finally, the bunkers were insufficiently supplied with ammunition, which was to be delivered on 1 September but in reality never reached the troops.
Opposing forces.
The four bunkers were manned with the 70 men strong "151st fortress company "Węgierska Górka"" under the command of Captain Tadeusz Semik. The trenches around the bunkers were manned by the Border Defence Corps battalion ""Berezwecz"" under Major Kazimierz Czarkowski and the position was reinforced with two batteries of light artillery and one battery of mountain artillery from the 55th Light Artillery Regiment of the Polish 1st Mountain Brigade. In addition, the Polish forces were reinforced with small detachments of other units, among them two platoons of reserve forces of the ""Żywiec"" National Defence battalion and a small detachment of the mobilized Border Guard. Altogether, Captain Semik had roughly 1,200 men at his command.
Against the Polish forces stood the entire German 7th Infantry Division, a part of the XVII Corps of the German 14th Army under Wilhelm List. The division, commanded by Major General Eugen Ott, was composed of three infantry regiments, reinforced with heavy artillery (150 mm). Altogether, the German commander had roughly 17,000 men at his disposal, more than ten times the number available to his opponent.
Battle.
At half past 4 in the morning, on 1 September, the German 7th Infantry Division crossed the Polish border in the area of Milówka and started their assault towards the Polish positions. Their orders were to break through the weak Polish defences and outflank the Kraków Army, thus preventing it from withdrawing eastwards. However, the division was stopped by a delaying action of two Polish infantry companies of the reserve National Defence and Border Defence Corps. Although the Germans outnumbered the Polish forces stationed along the border at least 100 to 1, it was not until the late evening that they finally arrived at the area of Milówka, located only from the border. Under such circumstance the weak Polish units withdrew to the main lines of the defence in front of Węgierska Górka. The Germans arrived there early in the morning of the following day.
The German infantry tried to storm the Polish positions on the run, but were bloodily repelled. The German commander then called for artillery and aerial bombardment of the Polish lines and repeated the assaults, which however were all repelled by the infantry battalion manning the field fortifications around the bunkers. By the end of the day the Poles claimed eight enemy armoured vehicles and tanks, while the Germans were forced back to their initial positions between Milówka and Węgierska Górka. However, other German units in the area were more successful and Janusz Gaładyk, the commander of the Polish 1st Mountain Brigade, ordered all Polish units in the area to withdraw overnight to the area of Oczków, where they were to shield the flank of the Polish 21st Infantry Division. However, as the battle continued throughout the night, the orders reached only the "Waligóra" bunker, artillery units and parts of the "Berezwecz" battalion, while the crews of the remaining three bunkers and the infantry units shielding them remained on their positions.
The heavy fighting for the area continued until the early morning. "Waligóra" was manned by seven soldiers from a routed unit and continued to fire at the Germans after the original crew withdrew. However, they were armed with their personal rifles only and had no ammunition left, which forced them to capitulate soon afterwards. All of them were subsequently executed by the Germans. With the Polish infantry and artillery units withdrawn, by dawn the Germans finally managed to outflank the Polish positions and partially encircle them. The crews however decided to continue the struggle until their ammunitions ran out. After a night-long heavy fight, the crew of the "Włóczęga" fired their last ammunition at half past 8 o'clock in the morning and capitulated. This sealed the fate of the nearby "Wędrowiec", as its sides were now open to enemy fire. The German infantry were now able to approach it and throw grenades through the unsealed MG turret shaft. Although no Polish soldiers were wounded, this allowed the Germans to tow anti-tank guns right outside the sealed bunker and fire directly into the MG and artillery nests. The crew withdrew to the safe part of the bunker and continued the fight with rifles, but the bunker's HMG and the 37 mm anti-tank gun were destroyed. Finally, at 5 o'clock in the evening "Wędrowiec" also capitulated. This allowed the Germans to gain free passage towards Kraków and the rear of the withdrawing Kraków Army. The crew of the "Wąwóz" continued the fight, but the German commander decided to avoid further losses and bypassed it. Realizing this, the crew withdrew overnight and joined other Polish units still in the area.

The RIAI Travelling Scholarship is an award made annually by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland to one or more students of architecture attending a school of architecture in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.
The award has been made annually since 1935 and has former the basis for the careers of many notable Irish architects, among them Arthur Gibney, Sam Stephenson and Trevor Leaker.
Over the course of its history, the scholarship has been competed for in numerous ways. Current practice is for the RIAI to set a competition brief, which is then the subject of the design of a building or landscape by the competitors. An appointed jury of distinguished and learned architects and pedagogues then selects the winning entry.

Storebø

Storebø is the administrative centre and largest village in Austevoll municipality, Norway. As of January 1, 2009, its population is 1,054. Storebø is situated on the northern part of the island Huftarøy.
History.
The Austevoll church, the parish church in Austevoll, was moved from the village of Austevoll and rebuilt at Storebø in 1891. Storebø was made administrative centre in 1964, and the meetings of the municipal council were moved from the small island of Bakholmen to Storebø.
Toponymy.
The name "Storebø" has been in use since the mid 17th century, prior to that the village was called "Bø" or "Bøe". It is thought that "store", literally meaning "large", was added to separate it from "Bø" at the island Stord, since both farms were part of the Saint Mary's Abbey, Lyse. The "Bø" at Stord was named Litlabø, with "litla" meaning "small". The last element, "bø", comes from Old Norse and translates to "farm".
Economy.
Traditionally fishing and farming have been the principal industries at Storebø. Farming has been largely replaced, whilst fishery grew increasingly important during the second half of the 20th century. In the late 1970s and early 80s fish farming and oil-related industry were developed in Austevoll. Today some of the largest companies in the world within these to industries are based at Storebø, among these DOF and Austevoll Seafood, both companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

Braided Path

The Braided Path is a critically acclaimed trilogy of novels written by the author Chris Wooding. The series starts with "The Weavers of Saramyr" which was Wooding’s first adult fantasy book - as he usually writes for the teenage market. This is reflected in the book not just in the style of writing, but also in the graphic scenes as well. "The Weavers of Saramyr" was released in 2003; the second book, The Skein of Lament, was published in 2004; and "The Ascendancy Veil" was published in 2005 to end the trilogy. 
The story encompasses a mix of low and high fantasy settings as well as romantic, political, and fantasy themes.
The novels.
"The Weavers of Saramyr".
The story follows the character of Kaiku as she sets off to find out why her family was murdered. Pursued by all manner of demonic creatures, Kaiku soon discovers her family's death was a repercussion of something much bigger and is thrown into a world of mystery and political intrigue.
"The Skein of Lament".
A war is brewing in the empire of Saramyr and in the centre of it all is the young and delicate Lucia. Blessed or hindered, she does not know which, with the ability to talk to spirits, she must go on a journey of self discovery and the state of the empire depends on the path she takes.
"The Ascendancy Veil".
The war has been in motion now for a few years. Armies of horribly mutated creatures, known as Aberrants, are plaguing city streets. Slowly the apocalypse is coming. It is up to Kaiku, Lucia and friends to stop the impending doom and restore peace to the empire.

Baade's Window

Baade's Window is an area of the sky with relatively low amounts of interstellar "dust" along the line of sight from the Earth. This area is considered an observational "window" as the normally obscured Galactic Center of the Milky Way is visible in this direction. It is named for astronomer Walter Baade who first recognized its significance. This area corresponds to one of the brightest visible patches of the Milky Way.
History.
Walter Baade surveyed the stars in this area in the mid-1940s using the Hooker telescope on Mt Wilson in California while searching for the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Up until this time the structure and location of the galactic center was not known with certainty.
Significance.
Baade's Window is frequently used to study distant central bulge stars in visible and near-visible wavelengths of light. Important information on the internal geometry of the Milky Way is still being refined by measurements made through this "window". It is in the direction of the constellation of Sagittarius. The window is now known to be slightly "south" of the main central galaxy bulge. The window is irregular in outline and subtends about 1 degree of the sky. It is centered around the globular cluster NGC 6522. 
Baade's Window is the largest of the six areas through which central bulge stars are visible.
OGLE and other observation programs have successfully detected extrasolar planets orbiting around central bulge stars in this area by the gravitational microlensing method.

The Ass Ponys went on hiatus in 2005, after releasing the compilation album "The Okra Years" - 4 years after their last original material was released in "Lohio". More importantly, it appears that core band members are focused on new projects, so new Ass Ponys output seems unlikely any time soon. Vocalist Chuck Cleaver is focusing his attention on a new band, Wussy. Bill Alletzhauser currently fronts the band "The Hiders". Randy Cheek plays with The Libertines US, The Fairmount Girls and The Ready Stance. In November 2013, the Ass Ponys reunited briefly to perform at TedxCincinnati.

Phonetic symbols in Unicode

Unicode supports several phonetic scripts and notations through the existing writing systems and the addition of extra blocks with phonetic characters. These phonetic extras are derived of an existing script, usually Latin, Greek or Cyrillic. In Unicode there is no "IPA script". Apart from IPA, these blocks also contain Uralic Phonetic Alphabet characters.
Phonetic scripts.
The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) makes use of letters from other writing systems as most phonetic scripts do. IPA notably uses Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters. Combining diacritics also adds meaning to the phonetic text. Finally, these phonetic alphabets make use of modifier letters, that are specially constructed for the phonetic meaning. A "modifier letter" is strictly intended not as an independent grapheme but as a modification of the preceding character resulting in a distinct grapheme, notably in the context of the International Phonetic Alphabet. For example, ʰ should not occur on its own but modifies the preceding or following symbol. Thus, is a single IPA symbol, distinct from . In practice, however, several of these "modifier letters" are also used as full graphemes, e.g. ʿ as transliterating Semitic ayin or Hawaiian okina, or ˚ transliterating Abkhaz ә.
From IPA to Unicode.
Consonants.
The following tables indicates the Unicode code point sequences for phonemes as used in the International Phonetic Alphabet. A bold code point indicates that the Unicode chart provides an application note such as "voiced retroflex lateral" for . An entry in bold italics indicates the character name itself refers to a phoneme such as 
Vowels.
The following figures depict the phonetic vowels and their Unicode / UCS code points. Vowels appearing in pairs in the figure to the right indicate rounded and unrounded variations respectively. Again, characters with Unicode names referring to phonemes are indicated by bold text. Those with explicit application notes are indicated by bold italic text. Those from borrowed unchanged from another script (Latin, Greek or Cyrillic) are indicated by italics.
Unicode blocks.
Apart from regular Latin and Greek characters like "m" and "ɛ", these symbols are in special phonetics blocks:
From Unicode blocks to scripts.
Phonetical scripts are encoded in six Unicode blocks.
Spacing Modifier Letters (U+02B0–02FF).
The characters in the "Spacing Modifier Letters" block are intended as forming a unity with the preceding letter (which they "modify"). E.g. the character isn't intended simply as a superscript "h" (h), but as the mark of aspiration placed after the letter being aspirated, as in "aspirated voiceless bilabial plosive". The block contains:

Unicode symbols

In computing, a Unicode symbol is a Unicode character which is not part of a script used to write a natural language, but can be used as part of a text.
Many of the symbols are drawn from existing character sets or ISO or other national and international standards. The Unicode Standard states that “The universe of symbols is rich and open-ended.” This makes the issue of what symbols to encode and how symbols should be encoded more complicated than the issues surrounding writing systems. Unicode focuses on symbols that make sense in a one-dimensional plain-text context. For example, the typical two-dimensional arrangement of electronic diagram symbols justifies their exclusion. (Box-drawing characters are a partial exception, for legacy purposes.) For adequate treatment in plain text, symbols must also be largely monochromatic. Even with these limitations—monochromatic, one-dimensional and standards-based—the domain of potential Unicode symbols is extensive. Two recent symbol genre additions are the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols (Unicode 3.1) and "Yijing" Hexagram Symbols (Unicode 4.0).

Mark and Marcellian

Mark and Marcellian (Latin: "Marcus" and "Marcellianus") are martyrs venerated as saints by the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. Their cult is sometimes associated with that of Saints Tranquillinus, Martia, Nicostratus, Zoe, Castulus and Tiburtius, though not in the official liturgical books of the Church, which mention only Mark and Marcellianus (in first place) among the saints for 18 June. Their mention in the General Roman Calendar on that date from before the time of the Tridentine Calendar was removed in the 1969 revision, because nothing is known about them except their names, the fact of their martyrdom, and that they were buried on 18 June in the cemetery of Balbina on the Via Ardeatina.
Their legend states that they were martyred at Rome under the Emperor Diocletian towards the end of the third century, most likely in the year 286. They are mentioned in most of the ancient martyrologies, including the Roman Martyrology, and their martyrdom is described in the "Acts of St Sebastian", which, though ancient, are largely legendary.
Legend.
According to tradition, Mark and Marcellian were twin brothers from a distinguished family. They lived in Rome and became deacons in the early Church. When they refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods, they were arrested. Their parents, Tranquillinus and Martia, visited them in prison, urging them to renounce their being Christians. 
However, Saint Sebastian convinced them not to abandon their faith. Sebastian converted Tranquillinus and Martia, as well as Tiburtius, the son of Chromatius, the local prefect. Nicostratus, another official, and his wife Zoe, were also converted. According to the legend, Zoe had been a mute for six years. However, she made known to Sebastian her desire to convert to the Church. As soon as she had, her speech returned to her. Nicostratus then brought the rest of the prisoners; these were sixteen people who were also converted by Sebastian.
Chromatius and Tiburtius became converts, and Chromatius set free all his prisoners, resigned his position, and retired to Campania.
Mark and Marcellian were concealed by Castulus, a Christian officer, but they were betrayed by an apostate, Torquatus. The twins were again taken into custody. Chromatius's successor, Fabian, condemned them to be bound head downwards to two pillars with their feet nailed to them. Mark and Marcellian hung there for a full day until they were pierced with lances. The twins were buried in the Via Ardeatina, near the cemetery of Domitilla.
Meanwhile, Zoe was hung to the branch of a tree and a fire was kindled underneath her feet, and she was killed. Nicostratus and five others were drowned in the Tiber. Tiburtius was thrown into a ditch and buried alive.
Veneration.
The bodies of Marcus and Marcellianus were moved, probably during the ninth century, to the Church of Santi Cosma e Damiano. They were discovered there in 1583 during the reign of Pope Gregory XIII.
The bodies remain there in a tomb, near an ancient painting of the two martyrs with a third person, who appears to be the Virgin Mary. In 1902, their basilica in the catacombs of Saint Balbina was rediscovered.

WSBS-TV

WSBS-TV, virtual channel 22 (VHF digital channel 3), is a Mega TV owned-and-operated television station located in Key West, Florida, United States. It serves as the flagship station of owner Spanish Broadcasting System. WSBS maintains studio facilities located on Northwest 77th Avenue in Miami, and its transmitter is located on Bahama and Simonton Streets in Key West. The station's signal is relayed on low-power translator station, WSBS-CD, UHF channel 50 (virtual channel 22.1), in Miami.
The station's Mega TV programming has been available nationally on DirecTV since October 17, 2007, with its high definition feed available on the satellite provider since September 29, 2010.
History.
The station was originally licensed as WYDH on October 2, 1989; the calls were changed to WEYS on October 11, 1989, and the station itself first signed on the air in June 1993. WSBS-TV has had numerous callsign changes over the years. This has caused much confusion, both among viewers and writers. In many places, the station is still referred to as WEYS TeleNoticias, and "WDLP Licensing, Inc." remained the licensee for several months after the call change to WSBS-TV. Some of these calls have been reused by low-power repeater stations, themselves often subject to similar callsign shuffles (for instance, the WDLP callsign is currently used by a repeater for rival WGEN-TV). On April 4, 2003, the station changed its call letters to WGEN-TV; it was then changed to WDLP-TV on November 24 of that year. The current WSBS-TV call letters were first adopted on July 1, 2004, before reverting to the WDLP-TV callsign on September 28, 2004. Prior to 2005, the station was co-owned with another Key West station, WGEN-TV, under the ownership of Sonia Broadcasting.
On March 1, 2006, the station became a charter station of Mega TV when the network was launched, and changed its callsign back to the previous WSBS-TV letters. Its original slate of programming includes productions aimed at young Hispanic viewers. Mega TV's format follows a very similar pattern traced by rival Telemundo station WSCV (channel 51) and Univision station WLTV (channel 25) decades earlier: by creating its own television personalities. 
Digital television.
Analog-to-digital conversion.
WSBS-TV terminated its analog signal, on UHF channel 22, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 3. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display WSBS-TV's virtual channel as 22. WSBS is one of the only television stations in the United States to operate its digital signal on the VHF low band, which is especially rare on channels 2 to 4 (54-72 MHz), due to interference that the band is subjected to. It chose to keep this channel in the first round of the digital channel elections.
WSBS-CA (analog UHF channel 50), which lists "Miami, etc." as its city of license, flash cut its signal to digital in early 2010, and accordingly changed its callsign to WSBS-CD. This station has a Class A broadcast license, meaning that although it is low-power, it has protection from RF interference as full-power stations do. Like the main station, it uses virtual channel 22.1, as it is likely just an RF passthrough with no demodulation. Its transmitter is located in the Andover section of Miami Gardens, immediately south of the tower facility that is used by several other Miami area television stations, and has a directional antenna that aims mostly southeast and southwest, covering far northeastern Miami-Dade County, the city of Miami and far southeastern Broward County, up to just south of Fort Lauderdale.

List of criminal organizations in comics

The villainous or shadowy group and or organization is a long standing trope in adventure fiction, from Professor Moriarty's band of villains, to the sinister Mole Men that bedeviled Superman in his 1951 television show. This page will attempt to provide a somewhat complete list and history of the many criminal and terrorist organizations present in comic books.
Dark Horse Comics.
Individual Eleven.
The Individual Eleven (or Particularist Eleven) is a fictional terrorist group dealt with by Public Security Section 9 from the Ghost in the Shell manga series. The Individual Eleven's motive for terror is an essay also entitled "The Individual Eleven", which was, in reality, a fake essay implanted with a computer virus that infected everyone who read it. The virus itself does not cause the members of the Individual Eleven to commit their acts of terror, it is their own political views which cause them to do so. The virus only seems to make them unwilling martyrs.
The Wallenquist Organization.
The Wallenquist Organization is a criminal organization in the fictional universe of Frank Miller's "Sin City". It is led by Herr Wallenquist, a German-American (though the name is actually Swedish) mobster shrouded in mystery. The organization has a broad base of criminal enterprise to its name, including drug smuggling, assassination, organ harvesting and human trafficking for the purpose of illegal adoption and slavery, as well as having many city officials on their payroll at one time or the other.
The Magliozzi Crime Family.
The Magliozzi Crime Family control the Cosa Nostra in Sin City. Led by Don Giacco Magliozzi and based at the Magliozzi Mansion (located in Sacred Oaks), they were wiped out in "Family Values".
Shogakukan.
Hwalbindang.
The Hwalbindang is a criminal organization featured in the Korean anime and manhwa series "Shin Angyo Onshi". The Hwalbindang is a seven member group of powerful martial arts specialists who began working as bandits, taking money from the rich so that they could provide help for the poor. 
At some point their ideals become corrupted by a desire for vengeance harbored by their leader Hong Gildong. Despite being more powerful than him, half of the group died fighting Munsu, the Angyo Onshi (bearer of justice). The other half died fighting his sometimes ally Wonsul of the Formless Sword and Munsu's sworn enemy the mad sorcerer known as Aji Tae. With the exception of their leader Hong Gildong, the individual members of Hwalbindang are the most powerful in the Shin Angyo Onshi universe.
VIZ Media.
Akatsuki.
The Akatsuki (meaning "Dawn" or "Daybreak") is a criminal organization featured in the Japanese anime and manga series "Naruto". It is first introduced midway into the first part "Naruto", and its members gain significance as the main antagonists during the second part "Naruto Shippuuden". Despite being composed of only ten members, Akatsuki is arguably the most powerful organization in the "Naruto" universe. Each member of Akatsuki is an S-class criminal.

Hank Kuehne

Henry August "Hank" Kuehne II (born September 11, 1975) is an American former U.S. Amateur champion and professional golfer who enjoyed some success on the PGA Tour.
Kuehne was born in Dallas, Texas. His father started him playing golf at a young age. He has a sister (Kelli) who plays on the LPGA Tour, and a brother (Trip) who finished second to Tiger Woods in the 1994 U.S. Amateur and remains an amateur. Kuehne began his college career at Oklahoma State University, but later transferred to Southern Methodist University, where he earned All-American honors three times as a member of the golf team (third team in 1996, second team in 1998, and honorable mention in 1999). He won the 1998 U.S. Amateur and played on the 1998 U.S. Eisenhower Trophy team. He graduated from SMU in 1999 with a degree in communications and turned professional.
Although he has several professional wins in non-Tour events, Kuehne's best finish on the PGA Tour has been a T-2 at both the 2003 Shell Houston Open and the 2005 John Deere Classic. His best result in a major is a 65th place finish at the 1999 U.S. Open. In 2003, he won the Tour's Driving Distance title, unseating John Daly who had won eight consecutive titles and 11 in total.
Kuehne missed the cut at the 2012 Honda Classic, his first PGA Tour event since 2007. Lingering back problems prevented Kuehne from playing for five years.
Personal life.
Kuehne lives in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and has a son, Henry August Kuehne III (born 2005), with ex-wife Nicole Kuehne. After his divorce, he was seen in public with tennis champion Venus Williams, whom he accompanied to the 2007 Wimbledon Championships and the 2007 U.S. Open. They broke up in 2010, after which Kuehne met his current wife Andy, whom he married in May 2011.
Kuehne was initiated into Sigma Nu Fraternity while at Oklahoma State University (Epsilon Epsilon chapter).

Entity–attribute–value model

Entity–attribute–value model (EAV) is a data model to describe entities where the number of attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe them is potentially vast, but the number that will actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest. In mathematics, this model is known as a sparse matrix. EAV is also known as object–attribute–value model, vertical database model and open schema.
There are certain cases where an EAV schematic is an optimal approach to data modelling for a problem domain. However, in many cases where data can be modelled in statically relational terms an EAV based approach is an anti-pattern which can lead to longer development times, poor use of database resources and more complex queries when compared to a relationally-modelled data schema.
Structure of an EAV table.
This data representation is analogous to space-efficient methods of storing a sparse matrix, where only non-empty values are stored. In an EAV data model, each attribute-value pair is a fact describing an entity, and a row in an EAV table stores a single fact. EAV tables are often described as "long and skinny": "long" refers to the number of rows, "skinny" to the few columns.
Data is recorded as three columns:
Example.
One example of EAV modeling in production databases is seen with the clinical findings (past history, present complaints, physical examination, lab tests, special investigations, diagnoses) that can apply to a patient. Across all specialities of medicine, these can range in the hundreds of thousands (with new tests being developed every month). The majority of individuals who visit a doctor, however, have relatively few findings.
No doctor would ever have the time to ask a patient about every possible finding. Instead, the doctor focuses on the primary complaints, and asks questions related to these. Still other questions are based on the responses to previously asked questions. Other questions or tests may be related to findings in the physical exam. The presence of certain findings automatically rules out many others — e.g., one would not consider pregnancy, and medical conditions associated with it if the patient were a male.
When the patient's record is summarized, one typically records "positive" findings — e.g., the presence of an enlarged and hardened liver — as well as "significant negatives" — e.g., the absence of signs suggestive of alcoholism (which is one of the causes to a hard, enlarged liver). In any case, one would not record the vast number of non-relevant findings that were not looked for or found in this particular patient.
Consider how one would try to represent a general-purpose clinical record in a relational database. Clearly creating a table (or a set of tables) with thousands of columns is not the way to go, because the vast majority of columns would be null. To complicate things, in a longitudinal medical record that follows the patient over time, there may be multiple values of the same parameter: the height and weight of a child, for example, change as the child grows. Finally, the universe of clinical findings keeps growing: for example, diseases such as SARS emerge, and new lab tests are devised; this would require constant addition of columns, and constant revision of the user interface. (The situation where the list of attributes changes frequently is termed "attribute volatility" in database parlance.)
The following shows a snapshot of an EAV table for clinical findings. The entries shown within angle brackets are references to entries in other tables, shown here as text rather than as encoded foreign key values for ease of understanding. They represent some details of a visit to a doctor for fever on the morning of 1/5/98. In this example, the values are all literal values, but these could also be foreign keys to pre-defined value lists; these are particularly useful when the possible values are known to be limited.
The example below illustrates symptoms findings that might be seen in a patient with pneumonia.
EAV databases.
The term "EAV database" refers to a database design where a significant proportion of the data is modeled as EAV. However, even in a database described as "EAV-based", some tables in the system are traditional relational tables.
EAV versus row modeling.
EAV data described above to the contents of a supermarket sales receipt (which would be reflected in a Sales Line Items table in a database). The receipt lists only details of the items actually purchased, instead of listing every product in the store that the customer might have purchased but didn't. Like the clinical findings for a given patient, the sales receipt is sparse.
Row modeling, where facts about something (in this case, a sales transaction) are recorded as multiple "rows" rather than multiple "columns", is a standard data modeling technique. The differences between row modeling and EAV (which may be considered a "generalization" of row-modeling) are:
In a clinical data repository, row modeling also finds numerous uses; the laboratory test subschema is typically modeled this way, because lab test results are typically numeric, or can be encoded numerically.
The circumstances where you would need to go beyond standard row-modeling to EAV are listed below:
This situation arises in ontology-modeling environments, where categories ("classes") must often be created on the fly, and some classes are often eliminated in subsequent cycles of prototyping.
Physical representation of EAV data.
The Entity.
In clinical data, the entity is typically a clinical event, as described above. In more general-purpose settings, the entity is a foreign key into an "objects" table that records common information about every "object" (thing) in the database – at the minimum, a preferred name and brief description, as well as the category/class of entity to which it belongs. Every record (object) in this table is assigned a machine-generated object ID.
The "objects table" approach was pioneered by Tom Slezak and colleagues at Lawrence Livermore Laboratories for the Chromosome 19 database, and is now standard in most large bioinformatics databases. The use of an objects table does not mandate the concurrent use of an EAV design: conventional tables can be used to store the category-specific details of each object.
The major benefit to a central objects table is that, by having a supporting table of object synonyms and keywords, one can provide a standard Google-like search mechanism across the entire system where the user can find information about any object of interest without having to first specify the category that it belongs to. (This is important in bioscience systems where a keyword like "acetylcholine" could refer either to the molecule itself, which is a neurotransmitter, or the biological receptor to which it binds.)
The Attribute.
In the EAV table itself, this is just an attribute ID, a foreign key into an Attribute Definitions table, as stated above. However, there are usually multiple metadata tables that contain attribute-related information, and these are discussed shortly.
The Value.
Coercing all values into strings, as in the EAV data example above, results in a simple, but non-scalable, structure: constant data type inter-conversions are required if one wants to do anything with the values, and an index on the value column of an EAV table is essentially useless. Also, it is not convenient to store large binary data, such as images, in Base64 encoded form in the same table as small integers or strings. Therefore larger systems use separate EAV tables for each data type (including binary large objects, "BLOBS"), with the metadata for a given attribute identifying the EAV table in which its data will be stored. This approach is actually quite efficient because the modest amount of attribute metadata for a given class or form that a user chooses to work with can be cached readily in memory. However, it requires moving of data from one table to another if an attribute’s data type is changed. (This does not happen often, but mistakes can be made in metadata definition just as in database schema design.)
Representing substructure: EAV with classes and relationships (EAV/CR).
In a simple EAV design, the values of an attribute are simple or primitive data types as far as the database engine is concerned. However, in EAV systems used for representation of highly diverse data, it is possible that a given object (class instance) may have substructure: that is, some of its attributes may represent other kinds of objects, which in turn may have substructure, to an arbitrary level of complexity. A car, for example, has an engine, a transmission, etc., and the engine has components such as cylinders. (The permissible substructure for a given class is defined within the system's attribute metadata, as discussed later. Thus, for example, the attribute "random-access-memory" could apply to the class "computer" but not to the class "engine".)
To represent substructure, one incorporates a special EAV table where the value column contains references to "other" entities in the system (i.e., foreign key values into the objects table). To get all the information on a given object requires a recursive traversal of the metadata, followed by a recursive traversal of the data that stops when every attribute retrieved is simple (atomic). Recursive traversal is necessary whether details of an individual class are represented in conventional or EAV form; such traversal is performed in standard object–relational systems, for example. In practice, the number of levels of recursion tends to be relatively modest for most classes, so the performance penalties due to recursion are modest.
EAV/CR (EAV with Classes and Relationships) refers to a framework that supports complex substructure. Its name is somewhat of a misnomer: while it was an outshoot of work on EAV systems, in practice, many or even most of the classes in such a system may be represented in standard relational form, based on whether the attributes are sparse or dense. EAV/CR is really characterized by its very detailed metadata, which is rich enough to support the automatic generation of browsing interfaces to individual classes without having to write class-by-class user-interface code.
The critical role of metadata in EAV systems.
In the words of Prof. Dr. Daniel Masys (formerly Chair of Vanderbilt University's Medical Informatics Department), the challenges of working with EAV stem from the fact that in an EAV database, the "physical schema" (the way data are stored) is radically different from the "logical schema" – the way users, and many software applications such as statistics packages, regard it, i.e., as conventional rows and columns for individual classes. (Because an EAV table conceptually mixes apples, oranges, grapefruit and chop suey, if you want to do any analysis of the data using standard off-the-shelf software, in most cases you have to convert subsets of it into columnar form. The process of doing this, called pivoting, is important enough to be discussed separately.)
Metadata helps perform the sleight of hand that lets users interact with the system in terms of the logical schema rather than the physical: the software continually consults the metadata for various operations such as data presentation, interactive validation, bulk data extraction and ad hoc query. The metadata can actually be used to customize the behavior of the system.
EAV systems trade off simplicity in the physical and logical structure of the data for complexity in their metadata, which, among other things, plays the role that database constraints and referential integrity do in standard database designs. Such a tradeoff is generally worthwhile, because in the typical mixed schema of production systems, the data in conventional relational tables can also benefit from functionality such as automatic interface generation. The structure of the metadata is complex enough that it comprises its own subschema within the database: various foreign keys in the data tables refer to tables within this subschema. This subschema is standard-relational, with features such as constraints and referential integrity being used to the hilt.
The correctness of the metadata contents, in terms of the intended system behavior, is critical and the task of ensuring correctness means that, when creating an EAV system, considerable design efforts must go into building user interfaces for metadata editing that can be used by people on the team who know the problem domain (e.g., clinical medicine) but are not necessarily programmers. (Historically, one of the main reasons why the pre-relational TMR system failed to be adopted at sites other than its home institution was that all metadata was stored in a single file with a non-intuitive structure. Customizing system behavior by altering the contents of this file, without causing the system to break, was such a delicate task that the system's authors only trusted themselves to do it.)
Where an EAV system is implemented through RDF, the RDF Schema language may conveniently be used to express such metadata. This Schema information may then be used by the EAV database engine to dynamically re-organize its internal table structure for best efficiency.
Some final caveats regarding metadata:
Information captured in metadata.
Advanced validation metadata.
Validation, presentation and grouping metadata make possible the creation of code frameworks that support automatic user interface generation for both data browsing as well as interactive editing. In a production system that is delivered over the Web, the task of validation of EAV data is essentially moved from the back-end/database tier (which is powerless with respect to this task) to the middle /Web server tier. While back-end validation is always ideal, because it is impossible to subvert by attempting direct data entry into a table, middle tier validation through a generic framework is quite workable, though a significant amount of software design effort must go into building the framework first. The availability of open-source frameworks that can be studied and modified for individual needs can go a long way in avoiding wheel reinvention.
Scenarios that are appropriate for EAV modeling.
EAV modeling, under the alternative terms "generic data modeling" or "open schema", has long been a standard tool for advanced data modelers. Like any advanced technique, it can be double-edged, and should be used judiciously.
Also, the employment of EAV does not preclude the employment of traditional relational database modeling approaches within the same database schema. In EMRs that rely on an RBDMS, such as Cerner, which use an EAV approach for their clinical-data subschema, the vast majority of tables in the schema are in fact traditionally modeled, with attributes represented as individual columns rather than as rows.
The modeling of the metadata subschema of an EAV system, in fact, is a very good fit for traditional modeling, because of the inter-relationships between the various components of the metadata. In the TrialDB system, for example, the number of metadata tables in the schema outnumber the data tables by about ten to one. Because the correctness and consistency of metadata is critical to the correct operation of an EAV system, the system designer wants to take full advantages of all of the features that RDBMSs provide, such as referential integrity and programmable constraints, rather than having to reinvent the RDBMS-engine wheel. Consequently, the numerous metadata tables that support EAV designs are typically in third-normal relational form.
Modeling sparse attributes.
The typical case for using the EAV model is for highly sparse, heterogeneous attributes, such as clinical parameters in the electronic medical record (EMRs), as stated above. Even here, however, it is accurate to state that the EAV modeling principle is applied to a "sub-schema" of the database rather than for all of its contents. (Patient demographics, for example, are most naturally modeled in one-column-per-attribute, traditional relational structure.)
Consequently, the arguments about EAV vs. "relational" design reflect incomplete understanding of the problem: An EAV design should be employed only for that sub-schema of a database where sparse attributes need to be modeled: even here, they need to be supported by third normal form metadata tables. There are relatively few database-design problems where sparse attributes are encountered: this is why the circumstances where EAV design is applicable are relatively rare. Even where they are encountered, a set of EAV tables is not the only way to address sparse data: an XML-based solution (discussed below) is applicable when the maximum number of attributes per entity is relatively modest, and the total volume of sparse data is also similarly modest. An example of this situation is the problems of capturing variable attributes for different product types.
Modeling numerous classes with very few instances per class: highly dynamic schemas.
Another application of EAV is in modeling classes and attributes that, while not sparse, are dynamic, but where the number of data rows per class will be relatively modest – a couple of hundred rows at most, but typically a few dozen – and the system developer is also required to provide a Web-based end-user interface within a very short turnaround time. "Dynamic" means that new classes and attributes need to be continually defined and altered to represent an evolving data model. This scenario can occur in rapidly evolving scientific fields as well as in ontology development, especially during the prototyping and iterative refinement phases.
While creation of new tables and columns to represent a new category of data is not especially labor-intensive, the programming of Web-based interfaces that support browsing or basic editing with type- and range-based validation is. In such a case, a more maintainable long-term solution is to create a framework where the class and attribute definitions are stored in metadata, and the software generates a basic user interface from this metadata dynamically.
The EAV/CR framework, mentioned earlier, was created to address this very situation. Note that an EAV data model is not essential here, but the system designer may consider it an acceptable alternative to creating, say, sixty or more tables containing a total of not more than two thousand rows. Here, because the number of rows per class is so few, efficiency considerations are less important; with the standard indexing by class ID/attribute ID, DBMS optimizers can easily cache the data for a small class in memory when running a query involving that class or attribute.
In the dynamic-attribute scenario, it is worth noting that Resource Description Framework (RDF) is being employed as the underpinning of Semantic-Web-related ontology work. RDF, intended to be a general method of representing information, is a form of EAV: an RDF triple comprises an object, a property, and a value.
At the end of Jon Bentley's book "Writing Efficient Programs", the author warns that making code more efficient generally also makes it harder to understand and maintain, and so one does not rush in and tweak code unless one has first determined that there is a performance problem, and measures such as code profiling have pinpointed the exact location of the bottleneck. Once you have done so, you modify only the specific code that needs to run faster. Similar considerations apply to EAV modeling: you apply it only to the sub-system where traditional relational modeling is known "a priori" to be unwieldy (as in the clinical data domain), or is discovered, during system evolution, to pose significant maintenance challenges.
Working with EAV data.
The Achilles heel of EAV is the difficulty of working with large volumes of EAV data. It is often necessary to transiently or permanently inter-convert between columnar and row-or EAV-modeled representations of the same data; this can be both error-prone if done manually as well as CPU-intensive. Generic frameworks that utilize attribute and attribute-grouping metadata address the former but not the latter limitation; their use is more or less mandated in the case of mixed schemas that contain a mixture of conventional-relational and EAV data, where the error quotient can be very significant.
The conversion operation is called pivoting. Pivoting is not required only for EAV data but also for any form or row-modeled data. (For example, implementations of the Apriori algorithm for Association Analysis, widely used to process supermarket sales data to identify other products that purchasers of a given product are also likely to buy, pivot row-modeled data as a first step.) Many database engines have proprietary SQL extensions to facilitate pivoting, and packages such as Microsoft Excel also support it. The circumstances where pivoting is necessary are considered below.
Relational division.
However, the structure of EAV data model is a perfect candidate for Relational Division, see relational algebra. With a good indexing strategy it's possible to get a response time in less than a few hundred milliseconds on a billion row EAV table. Microsoft SQL Server MVP Peter Larsson has proved this on a laptop and made the solution general available.
Optimizing pivoting performance.
Obviously, no matter what approaches you take, querying EAV will never be as fast as querying standard column-modeled relational data, in much the same way that access of elements in sparse matrices are not as fast as those on non-sparse matrices if the latter fit entirely into main memory. (Sparse matrices, represented using structures such as linked lists, require list traversal to access an element at a given X-Y position, while access to elements in matrices represented as 2-D arrays can be performed using fast CPU register operations.) If, however, you chose the EAV approach correctly for the problem that you were trying to solve, this is the price that you pay; in this respect, EAV modeling is an example of a space (and schema maintenance) versus CPU-time tradeoff.
Consideration for SQL Server 2008 and later: Sparse columns.
Microsoft SQL Server 2008 offers a (proprietary) alternative to EAV: columns with an atomic data type (e.g., numeric, varchar or datetime columns) can be designated as "sparse" simply by including the word SPARSE in the column definition of the CREATE TABLE statement. Sparse columns optimize the storage of NULL values (which now take up no space at all) and are useful when the majority records in a table will have NULL values for that column. Indexes on sparse columns are also optimized: only those rows with values are indexed. In addition, the contents of all sparse columns in a particular row of a table can be collectively aggregated into a single XML column (a column set), whose contents are of the form codice_1 In fact, if a column set is defined for a table as part of a CREATE TABLE statement, all sparse columns subsequently defined are typically added to it. This has the interesting consequence that the SQL statement codice_2 will not return the individual sparse columns, but concatenate all of them into a single XML column whose name is that of the column set (which therefore acts as a virtual, computed column).
Sparse columns are convenient for business applications such as product information, where the applicable attributes can be highly variable depending on the product type, but where the total number of variable attributes per product type are relatively modest. Limitations include:
For more details, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc280604.aspx
Alternative XML.
In the book "Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2008: T-SQL Programming" (Microsoft Press) by Itzik Ben-Gan and other authors, Dejan Sarka (author of the chapter on XML) provides an example of an Open Schema implementation using an XML column in a table to capture the variable/sparse information. This solution, which implements XML-schema-based validation, improves on a simpler version in the 2005 edition of this book, which did not implement validation.
This book provides an overview of approaches to modeling sparse attributes, and points out that building an application that has to manage data gets extremely complicated when using EAV models, because of the extent of infrastructure that has to be developed in terms of metadata tables and application-framework code. The author's XML example (which the authors advocate as simpler than building a framework on top of an EAV design) solves the problem of server-based data validation (which must be done by middle-tier and browser-based code in EAV-based frameworks), but has the following drawbacks:
All of the above drawbacks are remediable by creating a layer of metadata and application code, but in creating this, the original "advantage" of not having to create a framework has vanished. The fact is that modeling sparse data robustly is a hard database-application-design problem, and there are no shortcuts. Sarka's work, however, proves the viability of using an XML field instead of type-specific relational EAV tables for the data-storage layer, and in situations where the number of attributes per entity is extremely modest (e.g., variable product attributes for different product types) the XML-based solution is more compact than an EAV-table-based one. (XML itself may be regarded as a means of attribute-value data representation, though it is based on structured text rather than on tables.)
EAV and cloud computing.
Many cloud computing vendors offer data stores based on the EAV model, where an arbitrary number of attributes can be associated with a given entity. Roger Jennings provides an in-depth comparison of these. In Amazon's offering, SimpleDB, the data type is limited to strings, and data that is intrinsically non-string must be coerced to string (e.g., numbers must be padded with leading zeros) if you wish to perform operations such as sorting. Microsoft's offering, Windows Azure Table Storage, offers a limited set of data types: byte[], bool, DateTime, double, Guid, int, long and string The Google App Engine [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html offers the greatest variety of data types: in addition to dividing numeric data into int, long, or float, it also defines custom data types such as phone number, E-mail address, geocode and hyperlink. Google, but not Amazon or Microsoft, lets you define metadata that would prevent invalid attributes from being associated with a particular class of entity, by letting you create a metadata model.
Google lets you operate on the data using a subset of SQL; Microsoft offer a URL-based querying syntax that is abstracted via a LINQ provider; Amazon offer a more limited syntax. Of concern, built-in support for combining different entities through joins is currently (April '10) non-existent with all three engines. Such operations have to be performed by application code. This may not be a concern if the application servers are co-located with the data servers at the vendor's data center, but a lot of network traffic would be generated if the two were geographically separated.
An EAV approach is justified only when the attributes that are being modeled are numerous and sparse: if the data being captured does not meet this requirement, the cloud vendors' default EAV approach is often a mismatch for applications that require a true back-end database (as opposed to merely a means of persistent data storage). Retrofitting the vast majority of existing database applications, which use a traditional data-modeling approach, to an EAV-type cloud architecture, would require major surgery. Microsoft discovered, for example, that its database-application-developer base was largely reluctant to invest such effort. More recently, therefore, Microsoft has provided a premium offering – a cloud-accessible full-fledged relational engine, SQL Server Azure, which allows porting of existing database applications with modest changes.
One significant limitation of SQL Azure is that physical databases are limited to 150GB in size (as of Oct 2012). Microsoft recommends that data sets larger than this be split into multiple physical databases and accessed with parallel queries.
Tree structures and relational databases.
There exist several other approaches for the representation of tree-structured data, be it XML or other formats, in a relational database, like Nested set model (:de:Nested set, On the other hand, database vendors have begun to include XML support into their data structures and query features, like in IBM DB2, where XML data is stored as XML separate from the tables, or in PostgreSQL, with a XML data type [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/datatype-xml.html and Xpath queries as part of SQL statements. These developments accomplish, improve or substitute the EAV model approach.
It should be noted, however, that the uses of XML are not necessarily the same as the use of an EAV model, though they can overlap. XML is preferable to EAV for arbitrarily hierarchical data that is relatively modest in volume for a single entity: it is not intended to scale up to the multi-gigabyte level with respect to data-manipulation performance. XML is not concerned per-se with the sparse-attribute problem, and when the data model underlying the information to be represented can be decomposed straightforwardly into a relational structure, XML is better suited as a means of data interchange than as a primary storage mechanism. EAV, as stated earlier, is specifically (and only) applicable to the sparse-attribute scenario. When such a scenario holds, the use of datatype-specific attribute-value tables than can be indexed by entity, by attribute, and by value and manipulated through simple SQL statements is vastly more scalable than the use of an XML tree structure. The Google App Engine, mentioned above, uses strongly-typed-value tables for a good reason.
History of EAV database systems.
EAV, as a general-purpose means of knowledge representation, originated with the concept of "association lists" (attribute-value pairs). Commonly used today, these were first introduced in the language LISP. 
Attribute-value pairs are widely used for diverse applications, such as configuration files (using a simple syntax like "attribute = value"). An example of non-database use of EAV is in UIMA (Uniform Information Management Architecture), a standard now managed by the Apache Foundation and employed in areas such as Natural Language Processing (UIMA). Software that analyses text typically marks up ("annotates") a segment: the example provided in the UIMA tutorial is a program that performs Named Entity Recognition on a document, annotating the text segment "President Bush" with the annotation-attribute-value triple "(Person, Full_Name, "George W. Bush")". Such annotations may be stored in a database table.
While EAV does not have a direct connection to AV-pairs, Stead and Hammond appear to be the first to have conceived of their use for persistent storage of arbitrarily complex data.
The first medical record systems to employ EAV were the Regenstrief electronic medical record (the effort led by Clement MacDonald), William Stead and Ed Hammond's TMR (The Medical Record) system and the HELP Clinical Data Repository (CDR) created by Homer Warner's group at LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah. (The Regenstrief system actually used a Patient-Attribute-Timestamp-Value design: the use of the timestamp supported retrieval of values for a given patient/attribute in chronological order.) All these systems, developed in the 1970s, were released before commercial systems based on E.F. Codd's relational database model were available, though HELP was much later ported to a relational architecture and commercialized by the 3M corporation. (Note that while Codd's landmark paper was published in 1970, its heavily mathematical tone had the unfortunate effect of diminishing its accessibility among non-computer-science types and consequently delaying the model's acceptance in IT and software-vendor circles. The value of the subsequent contribution of Christopher J. Date, Codd's colleague at IBM, in translating these ideas into accessible language, accompanied by simple examples that illustrated their power, cannot be overestimated.)
A group at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center were the first to use a relational database engine as the foundation of an EAV system.
The open-source TrialDB clinical study data management system of Nadkarni et al. was the first to use multiple EAV tables, one for each DBMS data type.
The EAV/CR framework, designed primarily by Luis Marenco and Prakash Nadkarni, overlaid the principles of object orientation onto EAV; it built on Tom Slezak's object table approach (described earlier in the "Entity" section). SenseLab, a publicly accessible neuroscience database, is built with the EAV/CR framework. Additionally, there are numerous commercial applications that use aspects of EAV internally including Oracle Designer (applied to ER modeling), Kalido (applied to data warehousing and master data management), and Lazysoft Sentences (applied to custom software development).
An EAV system that does not sit on top of a tabular structure but instead directly on a B Tree is InfinityDB, which eliminates the need for one table per value data type.

Pitch (sports field)

A pitch or a sports ground is an outdoor playing area for various sports. The term is used in British and Australian English; the comparable term in American English is playing field. In most sports, the official technical term is field of play, although this is not regularly used by those outside of refereeing/umpiring circles.
In the sport of cricket, the cricket pitch refers not to the entire field of play, but to the section of the field on which batting and bowling take place in the centre of the field. The pitch is prepared differently from the rest of the field, to provide a harder surface for bowling.
A pitch is often a regulation space, as in an association football pitch.

Diósd

Diósd (), Hungary is a small town located between the larger cities of Budapest and Érd in the Budapest metropolitan area, Pest County. It's best found by travelling on road number 7 (earlier road number 70),(also known as "Balatoni út" to locals), which crosses the commune. The motorway M0 runs at the very edge of Diósd.
Though many residents commute to work to the capital city Budapest, the largest employers in the town are a manufacturing plant, named New MGM Zrt., that produces ball bearings and tapered roller bearing for worldwide OEM customers and dealers, an Interspar grocery store, and the International Christian School of Budapest[http://www.icsbudapest.org/], a school that serves missionary families, expatriates, and Hungarians.
Thanks to the presence of ICSB, the town has an international (mostly German and American population.
Diósd is also known in German by the name "Orasch". The reason for this phenomenon is that after the Turkish invasion, the area was fully uninhabited. Swabians arrived from Southern Germany to repopulate the town and they were in majority there until the end of the second world war, when many of the Swabes were chased away.
Diósd was first mentioned in 1417, under king Sigismund
At the beginning of 20th century was part of the Fejér county.
Nowadays many old, Swabian peasant houses can be seen in the town and there is, among others, a Museum for Radio and Television.
Since 1989, Diósd works in tight partnership with the German town Alsbach-Hähnlein in Hesse.

The Man and the City

The Man and the City is a dramatic television series which was aired on the ABC television network as part of its Fall 1971 lineup from September 15, 1971 to January 5, 1972.
"The Man and the City" stars the well-known Hollywood actor Anthony Quinn as Thomas Jefferson Alcala, the long-term Hispanic mayor of a major but unidentified city in the Southwestern United States (location shooting was done in Albuquerque, New Mexico). Quinn's WASP deputy, Andy Hays, was portrayed by Mike Farrell. Hays' main role was to make sure that the well-meaning Mayor Alcala did not become so engrossed in aiding individual constituents with their problems that he failed to address the issues facing the city as a whole.
Despite the vast talents of Quinn and the earnest Farrell, "The Man and the City" was a Nielsen ratings failure, finishing third in its Wednesday night time slot against the hit private eye show "Mannix" and the Rod Serling anthology series "Night Gallery", and was cancelled at midseason.

FCB (advertising agency)

Foote, Cone & Belding, aka FCB, is one of the largest global advertising agency networks. It is owned by Interpublic Group and was formed by the 2006 merger of the original Foote, Cone & Belding (FCB) and Draft, adopting the name "Draftfcb" until 2014. Although the merger of the two agencies is fairly young, the origins of the conglomerate date back to 1873, with the opening of Lord & Thomas ad agency, which later became Foote, Cone, & Belding. The Interpublic Group is one of the big four agency holdings conglomerates, the others being Publicis, WPP, and Omnicom.
History.
Founded as Lord and Thomas in Chicago in 1873, FCB was the world's third oldest advertising agency. Albert Lasker, a founding figure of modern advertising, went to work for the firm as a clerk in 1898, working his way up until he purchased it in 1912. Chicago, along with New York, was the center of the nation's advertising industry, and Lasker, known as the "father of modern advertising", made Chicago his base from 1898-1942. As head of the Lord and Thomas agency, Lasker devised a copywriting technique that appealed directly to the psychology of the consumer. Women seldom smoked cigarettes; he told them if they smoked Lucky Strikes they could stay slender. Lasker's use of radio, particularly with his campaigns for Palmolive soap, Pepsodent toothpaste, Kotex feminine hygiene products, and Lucky Strike cigarettes, not only revolutionized the advertising industry but also significantly changed popular culture.
In 1942, Lasker sold Lord and Thomas to its three top managers, Emerson H. Foote in New York, Fairfax Cone in Chicago, and Don Belding in California, who renamed it. In 2000, the agency reported billings of $9.5 billion and more than 190 offices serving clients in 102 countries.
The direct marketing agency, Kobs & Brady, founded in 1978, was the precursor for Draft. Howard Draft was an account executive at the agency, which in 1986 was acquired by Ted Bates Worldwide. The agency was renamed Kobs & Draft when Draft became its Chairman and CEO in 1988. In 1995, the agency regained its independence in a management buyout and was renamed Draft Direct Worldwide. A year later, Draft Direct Worldwide was purchased by The Interpublic Group of Companies.
Draft Direct Worldwide and Foote, Cone & Belding merged in June 2006, to form Draftfcb. The agency’s global corporate leadership team includes Howard Draft, executive chairman; Jonathan Harries, vice chairman emeritus and executive advisor, global creative; and Neil Miller, COO. In March 2013, Carter Murray was named the incoming CEO of Draftfcb.
Less than a year after the merger, in April 2007, Kmart switched its $740 million account from Grey New York to Draftfcb Chicago without a pitch. Kmart's chief marketing officer, Bill Stewart, said: "Grey has been a good partner over the years, but we feel Draftfcb is uniquely qualified to assist our needs right now." Howard Draft, Draftfcb's chairman at the time, commented: "Our two organizations have a shared commitment to accountability and loyalty."
In October 2008, "Ad Age" focused on the state of the agency two years after the merger, noting: “In truth, in the two years since the Chicago-rooted agencies Draft and Foote Cone & Belding merged, the agency has won more than 250 pieces of business around the globe including Kmart, Qwest and the U.S. Census Bureau.” The article goes on to list other major account wins including: MoneyGram International, Domino’s Pizza (Puerto Rico) and DirecTV.
Wins in 2012 include Cox Communications, SeaWorld/Busch Gardens, Amtrak/Acela, PaperMate, and Air New Zealand, plus nearly 200 other new clients in the global network.
In 2013, the FDA tapped Draftfcb to create campaigns to stem youth tobacco use.
On 10 March 2014, the agency was renamed as FCB.
Campaigns and awards.
Since its creation in 2006, the agency and its work have been recognized at a number of award competitions—Cannes, "The One Show", and industry competitions Echoes, El Ojo, Effies, and Caples—as well as agency-of-the-year honors for its New Zealand, Indonesia, and Durban São Paulo, Mexico City and Kuwait offices. And in January 2010, the agency was recognized on "Advertising Age"'s annual A-List, which honors "the agencies that showed moxie, innovation and effectiveness in 2009." David Novak, CEO of Yum! Brands, was quoted in the article saying "are client maniacs. They are genuine business partners who really care about the success of our brands"
"Ad Age" regularly lists Draftfcb-created spots for brands like KFC, Oreo and Taco Bell among IAG/Nielsen’s most-liked and most-recalled ads, and Time.com’s Lev Grossman noted in his Nerd World blog that the spot for EA Games’ Mercenaries 2: World in Flames, “Oh No You Didn’t,” created by Draftfcb San Francisco, was the greatest video game ad of 2008.
Draftfcb San Francisco's "Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2" campaign took home Gold in the Outstanding Overall Marketing Campaign of the Year category and a Silver in the Best Online Rich Media category for their work on Mass Effect 2 at the 2011 MI6 Game Marketing Conference and Awards Show. In addition, the San Francisco office won two Bronzes for the same campaign at the 2011 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival.
The 2010 U.S. Census campaign, led by Draftfcb New York, received Gold in the multicultural category and the Research Achievement Award at the 2010 Advertising Research Foundation David Ogilvy Awards for Excellence in Advertising Research.
Draftfcb won more than 345 awards globally in 2010, including six best workplace honors for Draftfcb Chicago. Draftfcb Spain's "Cutty Shark Shanghai-London" event was named one of the Top 10 events of the first decade of the 21st century, according to Spanish magazine Estrategias. Draftfcb Johannesburg won two Silver Radio Lions at Cannes for Toyota.
In 2011, judges awarded Draftfcb New Zealand the Best in Show, Media Agency of the Year and Leadership awards, as well as five gold and three silver awards at the CAANZ Awards. Draftfcb New Zealand was also named Media Agency of the Year at the Fairfax Media/AdMedia Agency of the Year Awards in 2011, 2010 and 2008. Draftfcb Malaysia was voted the number one creative agency in Malaysia in 2010 by "Cream Magazine".
Draftfcb Healthcare was named "Agency of the Year" by "Medical Advertising News" in 2006 and 2009 and by "Medical Marketing & Media" in 2007 and 2011. In 2010 and 2011, it was named Most Creative Agency by "Medical Advertising News". In 2013, Draftfcb Healthcare’s “Escape The Stall” work for the Crohn’s & Colitis Founding was named “Best Philanthropic Campaign” at the Manny Awards by Medical Advertising News. Draftfcb Healthcare also won for “Get Your Shift Together” in the “Best Nonbranded Campaign” category for its work for TEVA targeting shift workers.
At the 2011 IPG MERGE Diversity & Inclusion Awards, Draftfcb Chicago won Gold for Multicultural Agency/Practice of the Year and Draftfcb New York won Gold for Inclusive Marketing Initiative of the Year for its leadership role on the 2010 U.S. Census. Draftfcb's U.S. operations also won a Gold for Supplier Diversity, celebrating commitment to engaging and supporting minority vendors across the country.
In 2012, Draftfcb was named the Agency Champion of Inclusion at the Interpublic Group’s 2012 Inclusion Awards. The agency received 17 Cannes Lions, four ARF David Ogilvy Awards for Excellence in Advertising Research, more than any other agency, for PACCAR, US Postal Service, KFC and MilkPEP, and three CLIO Awards.
Some of the most talked about campaigns in 2012 were OREO “Daily Twist” and New Zealand’s MINI “Driving Dogs.” Chicago’s Halloween web video for Kmart, Argentina’s work for ZonaJobs and Orange County’s “Operation Alaska” for Taco Bell also created a lot of buzz.
In 2013, Draftfcb won the Facebook Blue Studio Award for OREO “Daily Twist.” Draftfcb won three Reggie Awards for OREO 100th Birthday Celebration, Sharpie and Taco Bell. Eight offices won 14 CLIO Awards, six One Show PENCIL Awards for Valspar “Cityscape,” UTEC University Potable Water Generator, Prime Television “Secret Diary of a Call Girl,” Engen Calendar Fire Blanket and SPCA/MINI New Zealand “Driving Dogs.” The agency also won five North American Effie Awards for OREO “Daily Twist,” PFLAG “Stories to Inspire Change” and SPIRIVA “Elephant,” in addition to 35 Lions and a Grand Prix at the 2013 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Adweek awarded Draftfcb the first-ever Project Isaac Gravity Award, its top honor.

Voice of God Collective

Voice of God Collective is a British jazz music group led by guitarist Billy Jenkins, working mainly in the 1980s and 1990s. 
He used many of Britain's finest young jazz musicians, whom he plucked from obscurity while they rehearsed at Wood Wharf Studios in Greenwich, such as Django Bates, Iain Ballamy, The Fun Horns of Berlin and Steve Arguelles. Albums have been released on VOTP Records and Babel Label.
The name of the band comes from the quote "Vox populi, vox Dei" (originally attributed to the monk Alcuin), which Jenkins rewrote to be "The Voice of God is the Voice Of The People. And the religion is MUSIC".

Monte de Fralães

Monte de Fralães is a Portuguese parish, located in the municipality of Barcelos. It has a population of 270 inhabitants and a total area of 1.80 km2.
The parish's patron saint is St. Peter and his feast has been celebrated for four centuries every 15 August by the Confraternity of Our Lady of Health.
The actual parish church was in ancient times the chapel of the Correias, a local noble family. Deeply modified, it is today a small and beautiful temple, which has substituted, since 1913, for the former church. It possesses a remarkable 18th-century "talha" (gilt wood) alter. Remarkable also, dating from the 1910s, are the two lateral retables which receive the images of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Our Lady of Health.
The parish, that was born in the Mount of Assaia, where there was a very ancient town, a "citânia", had some important priests, like Jácome Dias (16th century), João Rodrigues de Carvalho and the writer João Rosa (19th century). Its original name was S. Cristóvão de Silveiros (11th century), as can be seen in the Censual do Bispo D. Pedro.
In the 13th century Monte de Fralães (then S. Pedro do Monte) was born, the great conqueror Paio Peres Correia.
In the 14th century, in the Solar of the Correias (Solar of Fralães), has been created the Municipality of Fralães, known as Honra de Fralães (that included also Viatodos and part of Silveiros); it would be extinguished in December 1836. Varied documentation of this autarchy is conserved in the parish and in Barcelos archives.
The pianist and composer Luís Costa was born in Monte de Fralães.

Trinwillershagen

Trinwillershagen is a municipality in the north of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. It is situated in the Vorpommern-Rügen district. Trinwillershagen used to be part of the Amt Ahrenshagen, since 1 January 2005 it is part of Amt Barth.
Geography.
Trinwillershagen is situated between Stralsund (to the East) and Ribnitz-Damgarten (about 10 km to the West). On an area of 34,21 km² there are 1.377 inhabitants (June 2005).
History.
Trinwillershagen was founded in the 14th century during the German Ostsiedlung (colonisation of the East). Its name is derived from the Old High German "Tründel", the name for the round shaped type of settlement that is called Rundling. Maps dating from 1583 show the round or circular shape of the village with small ponds in its middle.
The village was first mentioned in 1320 in the "Pommersches Urkundenbuch 5" (Pomeranian Book of Deeds Nr. 5). During the Thirty Years' War peasants and serfs suffered substantial damage from Albrecht von Wallenstein's troops. From the second half of the 18th century onwards Trinwillershagen was part of a kight's country estate, whose owner changed rather often over the years. The last owner Matthies had the estate farmed until the 1945 land reform was imposed by the Soviets. His farmers were dwelling in the houses along the only road (Altes Dorf).
During World War II, some new houses were built to accommodate people from Stralsund, whose houses had been bombed.
After the GDR had been founded and following the land reform, the Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft (LPG) Trinwillershagen "Rotes Banner" was founded, which was dismantled only after the German reunification in 1991. During the 1990s some new family homes have been built and old houses have undergone diligent restoration work. Much of the former LPG area has been turned into meadows and park land.
Economy.
In Trinwillershagen there are some minor contractor's companies, farmers and one restaurant. There is also a bank, a shopping centre a dentist and a general practitioner. An industrial estate and a recently built wind farm add to Trinwillershagen's modest economical improvement.
Most inhabitants are commuting to Ribnitz-Damgarten, Barth, Stralsund or Rostock. Many people are unemployed, however, as there is a general lack of jobs in the area.
Transport.
The village is located near Bundesstrasse 105.
Education, culture and sports.
The village has its own primary school, which is soon to be closed, however, and a kindergarten. Cultural institutions are the regular dance and music events in the former "Kulturhaus", the family meeting of the Methodist church and a skittle alley. Annual village festivals add to the village's entertainment. The local soccer club "Rot-Weiss" is looking back on a long tradition.
Trivia.
Walter Ulbricht and Anastas Mikoyan, member of the Soviet Politburo, visited the LPG and the village in 1957 in order to see the "modern socialist" farming industry that had been installed there. On July 13, 2006, George W. Bush, President of the United States, visited Trinwillershagen during a state visit, as Trinwillershagen is located in Chancellor Angela Merkel's home district.

WGEN-TV

WGEN-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 8, is a MundoFox-affiliated television station located in Key West, Florida, United States. The station is owned by Mapale, LLC, the parent of Colombian-based holding company Valórem S.A.. WGEN-TV maintains studio facilities located on Northwest 75th Street in Miami's Medley neighborhood, and its transmitter is located on Simonton Street in Key West. WGEN's signal is relayed through a network of eight low-power translator stations throughout South Florida and the Florida Keys. 
History.
The station first signed on the air on May 26, 1996 as WWFD; it subsequently changed its call letters to WWTU on February 8, 2000, then to WVIB on February 8, 2002 and finally to its current calls as WGEN-TV on July 1, 2004. Prior to December 2005, WGEN was, under the ownership of Sonia Broadcasting, co-owned with another Key West station, WDLP-TV (channel 22, now WSBS-TV).
In December 2005, WGEN came under the control of Colombian broadcaster Caracol Televisión, which holds a 25% ownership stake in Mapale, LLC, the maximum allowed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations regarding foreign ownership of broadcast stations. On September 18, 2006, Caracol relaunched the station under the "GenTV" brand and began serving as its primary program supplier; programming on WGEN included Colombian and Brazilian telenovelas, a Colombian-produced news program, and a local version of "Desafío 20.06", a "reality show" similar to "Survivor".
On December 28, 2012 at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, MundoFox moved its Miami affiliation from WJAN-CD to WGEN-TV. While WGEN-TV is owned and operated by and airs programming from the Colombian television network Caracol Televisión, as a MundoFox affiliate, it shares an indirect connection with another Colombian television network as the network is half-owned by the competing RCN Televisión. RCN content comes from the network feed of MundoFox, while Caracol programming is distributed directly to WGEN-TV through its owners. WGEN-TV airs national newscasts from MundoFox through "Noticias MundoFox", which uses the resources of NTN24, RCN’s sister network and international Spanish-language news channel; WGEN-TV also airs Caracol's national newscast "Noticias Caracol".
Digital television.
Digital channels.
The station's digital signal is multiplexed:
Analog-to-digital conversion.
WGEN-TV terminated its analog signal, on UHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 12 to its analog-era VHF channel 8.
Programming.
As of December 2012, locally produced and outsourced programs broadcast by WGEN-TV include "ALAIN, Una Mano Amiga", "El Show con Tony Benitez" and "Club 10". Among the notable programs broadcast by WGEN-TV include: "Desafío 20.06", "¿Quién Manda a Quién?" (a remake of "Who's The Boss", produced by Caracol Television and Sony Pictures Entertainment), "La Boca Loca De Paul" (hosted by Paul Bouche), "La Ex" and "Maria Elvira".
Newscasts.
WGEN-TV presently broadcasts five hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with one hour on weekdays). The station's newscasts, which are branded as "Noticias MundoFox 8", air for a half-hour each weekday at 5:00 and 10:00 p.m. In 2012, WGEN began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.
Repeaters.
WGEN-TV's signal is relayed on eight translator stationss in the Miami area and the Florida Keys. From north to south, these translators are:
W21CL was established before 1979 as W65AP, until forced to move out of the 700MHz band by the digital television transition. W17DG-D was also established before 1979, as was W63AL, which was briefly W23BG from late 1990 to early 1991. WDLP-CA began operations in 1992 as W21BD, which was deleted in June 1994 after its permit expired, and restored the following December. In April 2003, its license was upgraded to Class A status and its calls were changed to WGEN-CA; it was then changed to WDLP-CA the following month, and later to WDLP-CD on August 11, 2011.
W49CL and WGEN-LP in Miami are both now listed as having WSBS-TV in Key West as their parent station, indicating that they may be leased to that station. Both are still owned by WGEN-TV owner Mapale, which does not identify them on the GenTV website's station map. Their successor "digital companion channels" respectively are W24DE-D and WGEN-LD, which both rebroadcast WGEN-TV (unlike full-power stations, they are separate facilities, and as LPTV stations they are not required to simulcast the analog feed on digital).
W38AA in Marathon and W39AC in Key West are listed as having WSBS-TV as their primary station, although in the past the two stations had retransmitted Miami CBS owned-and-operated station WFOR-TV (channel 4). Their respective digital companion channels W08ED-D (under construction) and W12DI-D are shown as having WGEN-TV as the primary station, and 12.1 is shown on WGEN's map as an additional channel for Key West (though only analog channel 21 is shown for Marathon). Because Key West and even Marathon are well within the broadcast range of both WSBS and WGEN, it is unclear why this would be necessary (or in Key West, useful at all), given the total flatness of the terrain and water and the complete lack of other obstructions like tall buildings. The only advantage for WSBS is to continue to be seen on analog television.
All translator stations are owned by Mapale (meaning roughly "map it") as they have always been. Digital stations (ending in -D, -LD, or -CD) may use virtual channel 8.1 as the main station does, or may use their physical (RF) channel numbers as their virtual channel. The -CA or -CD suffixes indicate Class A protection from other stations.

"Goodbye Marie" is a country-pop song written by Mel McDaniel and Dennis Linde. The song is about a man who has to leave his lover to head for "the lonesome highway" back to his home in Houston, Texas. 
Bobby Goldsboro took a version of the song to #17 on the Billboard Country chart in 1981. Kenny Rogers had previously covered the song on his 1979 #1 album "Kenny". Although the song was not issued as a single at the time, after Kenny Rogers signed to RCA Records his former label Liberty Records issued a newly overdubbed version as a single that went to #47 in 1986.
McDaniel also released the song on his "I'm Countryfied" album in 1981, and as the B-side of his single "I Call It Love."

Ayodhya 6 December 1992 (ISBN 0-670-05858-0) is a book written by P. V. Narasimha Rao and published on 1 August 2006, the tenth Prime Minister of India. Narasimha Rao had decreed that the book be published after his death, and accordingly it was published in August 2006. He claims that the book is not an "“exercise in self-righteousness or justification”", the content of the book indicate an attempt by him to absolve himself and his government of the responsibility for the failure to prevent the removal of the controversial structure known as "Babri Masjid". Narasimha Rao had assumed office in June 1991, and by that time the Ramjanamabhoomi-Babri Masjid issue was already in a state of serious alarm requiring intervention, including state intervention, to resolve the issue. 
The book attempts to offer the explanation rather than an answer to two baffling questions, namely,
The book endeavors to convince the readers that there was no lapse on his part as the head of the government of India or his government to protect the controversial structure. He concluded "“there was no lapse on the part of the Central Government and that if the State Government had at least made use of the central force in time and meaningfully, the Babari structure could certainly have been saved on December, 1992.”"

Miguel Domínguez

José Miguel Domínguez Alemán (January 14, 1756, most likely in Mexico City—April 22, 1830, Mexico City) was a New Spanish colonial official in New Spain who played a part in the Mexican independence movement. He was also a member of a transitional governing committee in the period between the abdication of Mexican Emperor Agustín de Iturbide and the installation of Guadalupe Victoria as the first president of independent Mexico. His wife, Josefa Ortiz de Domínguez, known as "La Corregidora", was a heroine of Mexican independence.
Background.
Domínguez was a Criollo (a Spaniard born in America), although his parents were from Spain. He studied law in the College of San Ildefonso, graduating and entering the legal profession. In 1791 he met Josefa Ortiz in the College of the Vizcainas and married her the same year. She was 12 years younger than him.
Domínguez occupied various positions in the treasury office and in other offices of the viceregal government. Viceroy Félix Berenguer de Marquina named him corregidor of the city of Querétaro. Domínguez was an opponent of Viceroy José de Iturrigaray's appropriation of the religious estates in 1805. In 1808, he proposed to the city government of Querétaro that they join with the government of Mexico City in establishing a junta for the colony, to govern New Spain in the name of the deposed King Ferdinand VII. Viceroy Iturrigaray at least tacitly supported this effort.
Independence conspiracy.
In Querétaro both Domínguez and his wife were involved in the independence conspiracy organized after the French occupation of Spain. Meetings were held in the guise of a literary society at the home of the priest José María Sánchez, and were under the protection of the corregidor himself. Besides the Domínguezes and Sánchez, the other conspirators included the licenciados Parra, Laso and Altamirano and the military officers Joaquín Arias, Francisco Lanzagorta Inchaurreri, Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama. The latter two were stationed in San Miguel el Grande, Guanajuato. They were in contact with Father Miguel Hidalgo in Dolores, Guanajuato, as was Domínguez. Also part of the conspiracy in Querétaro were the brothers Emeterio and Epigmenio González, as arms-makers for the rebels.
In addition there were organized conspiracies in San Miguel, Celaya, Guanajuato, San Felipe, San Luis Potosí and Mexico City. Father Hidalgo was chosen to lead. December 1, 1810 was chosen as the date for the insurrection, but this was later advanced to October 2.
However, the denunciations of Arias in Querétaro on September 10 and of Juan Garrido in Guanajuato on the 13th, forced the conspirators to take faster action. The corregidor was ordered to arrest the conspirators. He raided the house of Epigmenio González. Finding arms, he had González arrested. Aware of his wife's commitment, he had her locked in an upstairs room while he went to alert the militia. Josefa Ortiz was able to alert a fellow conspirator in the house next door, Ignacio Pérez. On September 15, 1810, Pérez rode to San Miguel, and from there to Dolores to give the warning.
In the early morning of the following day, September 16, 1810, Hidalgo gave the Grito de Dolores, signaling the beginning of the war for Mexican independence.
This led to the arrest of both the corregidor and the corregidora. They were held in the convent of La Cruz (Querétaro). Three years later, in 1813, the corregidora was sent to Mexico City, where she was held for several more years in the convent of Santa Clara. No longer a prisoner himself but deprived of his office, Domínguez moved to Mexico City to be near his wife. He was allowed to visit her occasionally. Recognizing his earlier service, Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca later granted him a small pension.
In the executive of the Republic.
In 1823 he served as a replacement in the triumvirate that exercised executive power in Mexico after the fall of Emperor Iturbide and before the selection of Guadalupe Victoria as president under the Constitution of 1824. From 1825 to 1827, he was named president of the Supreme Court.
He died in Mexico City in 1830, he was 74 years old, one year after the death of his wife.

Lamb Leer

Lamb Leer () is a 14.59 hectare (36.04 acre) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest between East Harptree and Priddy in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, notified in 1983. The cavern is a fragment of a very ancient major cave system which now contains one of the largest chambers on Mendip.
History.
Several explanations have been suggested for the origin of the name. One links to an old name for the area which was "Lambden". An alternative suggestion is that in the 1670s miners spoke of ""leirey places, that is cavernous"" which links to the German word "leer" which means void and may have been introduced by German miners. A more likely explanation is from the Anglo-Saxon word "lear" meaning empty or void.
Lamb Leer Cavern was first found by miners looking for lead around 1676, and in 1681 the geologist John Beaumont, the pioneer of pit caving, gave an account of his descent into the cave to the Royal Society. It was rediscovered in 1880, when a new shaft was driven in, and became something of a tourist attraction. By the 1920s the new shaft had become blocked and in 1936 the original entrance was re-opened. In the late 1930s a cablecar was in place across the Great Chamber. Additional chambers were discovered in the 1960s and 1970s.
In 1974, an un-lifelined caver fell off a ladder in Lamb Leer Cavern, and a novice caver who was at the bottom of the ladder was badly injured, resulting in legal action against the caving club for damages.
Access.
Access to this cave is not permitted by the landowner.
Description.
The system is dry, lying well above the present day water-table, and it is thought that the passages may well have originated before the Ice Age (Pleistocene Period) began. Sediments preserved in the caves are important as they allow geologists to study the record of the changing environmental conditions which occurred over this long period of time. 
The entrance shaft is known as Beaumont Shaft. The first large chamber encountered is The Beehive which contains a large stalagmite boss. Next is the Great Chamber which is high and across, and contains some formations. A passage from the roof of the Great Chamber leads to the St Valentine Series of passages, a number of which are well decorated.

Charmy Kaur

Charmi Kaur (also spelt as Charmee or Charmy) is an Indian film actress, who has predominantly appeared in Telugu films. She acted with stars such as Dileep, Mammootty, Amitabh Bachchan, Nandamuri Balakrishna, Akkineni Nagarjuna, Venkatesh, Jr. NTR, Prabhas, Siddarth, Ravi Teja, Sumanth, Nitin and Silambarasan. She is known for her dedication to learn Telugu in a short span of time. Charmi gave her voice to Kajal Aggarwal in the film "Chandamama" (2007). She was considered to be one of the best dancers in recent years. Her dance movements in movies like "Manthra" and "Pournami" are well received by audience and critics.
Early life.
Charmy was born in Mumbai and her family is of Punjabi-Sikh background. She studied in Carmelite Convent English High School in Vasai.
Career.
She made her acting debut in the 2002 Telugu film "Nee Thodu Kavali", in which she acted as a housewife at a young age of 13. This film was a flop, but helped Charmy in getting noticed by the south Indian film industry. Her next film was "Kadhal Azhivathillai" with Silambarasan, which was also a flop. During this time she acted in a Malayalam film directed by Vinayan named "Kattuchembakam". This film also bombed in box office. After that she acted in a couple more Tamil films but they bombed at the box office.
Her re-entry to Telugu films happened with "Neeke Manasichhaanu" a film with Sreekanth which was a failure; then in "Sri Anjaneyam", directed by ace director Krishna Vamsi which too was a failed attempt. It was followed by another failure with "Chanti", paired against Ravi Teja. She finally got a big break in Telugu with "Gowri" in which she was paired with Sumanth. The stupendous success of "Mass" with Nagarjuna strengthened her position in Tollywood. Charmy's most critically acclaimed film so far is "Anukokunda Oka Roju". It was a heroine-oriented thriller. Her performance in the film was acclaimed by critics.
In 2006 she acted in "Pournami" which was a total failure in spite of high expectations, but her performance was appreciated. Though she did not learn Indian classical dance, her Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi dances in the film were appreciated by audiences. Later that year she was paired for the second time with Sumanth in "Chinnodu" but it was not a successful venture. Her next film, "Rakhi" (with NTR), was a hit. In 2007 "Mantra", a thriller with Charmy in the lead role, was declared as a surprise hit. Her performance in the film was appreciated and fetched her the Nandi Award for Best Actress of 2007.
Then, she starred in several lady oriented roles, including "Anukokunda Oka Roju", "Mantra", "Manorama 2009", "Kavya's Diary", "Sye Aata", "Mangala" in Telugu and "Laadam" in Tamil, out of which "Anukokunda Oka Roju" and "Mantra" were very successful.
In 2011, she got a chance to work in Bollywood in the film "Bbuddah... Hoga Terra Baap" starring Amitabh Bachchan. She had a supporting role in the film , which performed averagely in the box office. In 2012, she mostly did special songs in high budget films like "Dhamarukam", "Naayak" and "Yaare Koogadali". She appeared in two more Bollywood films, "Zila Ghaziabad" and "R... Rajkumar". She starred in two female-oriented Telugu films, "Prema Oka Maikam", directed by Chandu of 10th class fame, in which she played a call girl character in the film and "Pratighatana" in which she played a journalist. "Pratighatana" was Charmy's 50th film.

The Andersonville Trial

The Andersonville Trial was a television adaptation of a 1959 hit Broadway play by Saul Levitt, presented as an episode of PBS's 1970-71 season of "Hollywood Television Theatre".
The play was based on the actual 1865 trial of Henry Wirz, played by Richard Basehart, commander of the infamous Confederate Andersonville prison, where thousands of Union prisoners died of exposure, malnutrition, and disease. A notable cast included William Shatner as the Chief JAG Prosecutor Norton Parker Chipman, Jack Cassidy (who was nominated for an Emmy) as Wirz's defense counsel, Cameron Mitchell as Lew Wallace, a Union general and the future author of "Ben-Hur", and Buddy Ebsen as a Georgia physician called in to testify about the fate of many of the Union prisoners.
The television adaptation was directed by actor George C. Scott, who had played Chipman in the original stage version.
In Leonard Probst's 1978 compilation of celebrity interviews, "Off Camera", Scott explained that what he found most difficult about playing Chipman onstage was that Henry Wirz, the defendant, came across as a tragic victim, although his negligence, according to the verdict, had a great deal to do with the deplorable conditions at Andersonville, and Scott found it very difficult to deal with the fact that the audience was compelled to dislike Chipman, who was, essentially, the hero of the piece.
The TV production of the play won 1971 Emmy Awards for "Outstanding Single Program," for "Technical Direction and Electronic Camerawork," and for Levitt's adaptation. It was also honored with a Peabody Award.

Moving to the Netherlands, she formed her own band, focusing more on original works and becoming one of the country's highest paid live performers.
Recording her first album "Wonderfool" in 2000 led to four music videos, five singles and well over 200 gigs. She also sang the title tracks for two major motion pictures and performed in a festival in Belgium supporting Joe Cocker and Stuff, K's Choice and Heather Nova to a crowd of more than 100,000 people. Dilana also performed at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, with Dutch performers.
Supernova.
Dilana was one of the finalists on the CBS reality television show of season two of "Rock Star", where she finished runner-up to Lukas Rossi. The show is a competition in which the band chooses a lead singer from a group of contestants. Although Dilana received the most consistent praise for her performances of all the contestants, she came under fire from fans, her competition, and from Rock Star Supernova because of comments she made during a staged press conference, in which she was forthcoming with her opinion of her competitors. Although she apologized repeatedly for her remarks afterwards, it appears that her first "bottom three" appearance was a result of this controversy. The controversy seemed to die down by the end of the program; on the final night of voting, she was said to have received the highest number of votes at least at one point during the evening, and ended up with the second highest number overall. After the show, Gilby Clarke revealed that Lukas Rossi defeated Dilana because "he made music sound more like a band, whereas Dilana sounded like a singer, with Rock Star Supernova backing her."
Post Supernova.
Gigs and tours.
Following her participation on "Rock Star", Dilana performed various venues with fellow "" finalist Magni; with Magni, she won an FM957 People's Choice Award for "Gig of the Year" in January 2007. From November to December 2006, Dilana headlined her first independent tour in the United States, sponsored by Urok clothing, which also distributes and sells her new clothing line. From January to February 2007, she opened for the Rock Star Supernova tour, playing an acoustic set with Magni on guitar. While critics generally panned Rock Star Supernova, Dilana's performances were met with positive reception. Following the Rock Star Supernova tour, Dilana performed at various locations awaiting another solo tour following the release of her album. This included opening for the band Aerosmith on April 28, 2007 at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. In 2008, she performed at several charity events for Livin' the Music in Nashville, Los Angeles, and Baton Rouge.
Dilana starred in her first movie entitled "Angel Camouflaged" which was filmed in Charleston, South Carolina on October 23, 2009. This was an independent project by a Beaufort, SC filmmaker. "Angel Camouflaged" was released on July 28, 2010.
In the studio: "Inside Out".
Dilana new album "Inside Out" was digitally released on November 17, 2009. "Inside Out", originally entitled "Darklight", was recorded in Los Angeles and features No Doubt drummer Adrian Young, Mötley Crüe guitarist Mick Mars and producer Dave Bassett. Although Dilana signed a contract with London based Hurricane Records (Hurricane Music Group Ltd) in early 2008 and was finished with recording her new album already in mid 2008, it was not released by said record company. In a later update from Dilana on hardrockhideout.com [3 she announced that not only did she get released from her contract with HMG due to the label's shutdown but also that the master recordings did not belong to her. Dilana then went into negotiations with Kabunk Records, LLC. Although Dilana was unable to sign a deal with Kabunk, the label did purchase the rights to the Inside Out album and will be releasing the album digitally.
Reception of the album has been initially, very positive. Music Reviewer Albert Watson, from Metromix music, writes,
Other singles.
Dilana has also released a series of singles, many of which will not be included on her debut album. Dilana has released covers of Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" and The Police classic "Roxanne". Dilana was also featured on a re-recording of "Black", a track on Gilby Clarke's best-of album released January 30. Dilana also released a version of Killer Queen; her version was featured on the final episode of the UK edition of When Woman Rule The World and the Women's Tennis Championship on Versus TV Network (formerly OLN) in November 2007. On Tuesday, June 9, 2009, Dilana released an original entitled "Hangover" on the AO Recordings label via iTunes.
"American Idol" connection.
In 2009, Dilana began to receive some national exposure because of "American Idol" as two contestants on the show credit her during post-"Idol" interviews. "American Idol" Season 8 contestant Adam Lambert sang an arrangement of "Ring of Fire" very similar to the one Dilana performed. In an interview with Michael Slezak of "Entertainment Weekly", Adam says he liked Dilana's arrangement a lot and that it was a source of inspiration for his cover of the song. Adam's cover of "Ring of Fire" did not go unnoticed by Dilana nor her record label:
Allison Iraheta, another "American Idol" Season 8 contestant, covered Dilana's song "Holiday" on her debut album, "Just Like You", slated for a December 1, 2009 release date. In an interview with Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music, who tells Allison that her cover of "Holiday" is the song on "Just Like You" she's most excited about because it's a cover of a Dilana song, said,
Later in the same interview, Allison said, "it is a little intimidating (to cover a song by someone you respect) at first cause I was like 'wow, this is so good,' but we're different." Dilana has said that Allison is "the only chic I would ever want to cover my song," calling her "so smart ... so talented" and saying that she had a "beautiful future ahead."

Twentieth Century (play)

Twentieth Century is a play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur based on the unproduced play "Napoleon of Broadway" by Charles B. Millholland, inspired by his experience working for the eccentric Broadway impresario David Belasco.
The Hecht-MacArthur comedy is set in the observation car of the "20th Century Limited", travelling from Chicago to New York's Grand Central Terminal. Aboard the luxury train are egomaniacal theatre producer Oscar Jaffe, desperately in need of a hit, and his former paramour and protégé, temperamental actress Lily Garland (born Mildred Plotka), who abandoned him for a Hollywood career.

Elgin-Butler Brick Company

The Elgin-Butler Brick Company manufactures structural ceramic glazed masonry products at a plant northeast of Austin, Texas, United States. The company enjoyed regional market dominance in structural brick and other ceramic products for much of the 20th century, until Acme Brick Company overtook its position.
The company was entirely family-owned and operated until the early 21st century, when lack of growth, heavy debt, and family infighting spurred the involvement of outside parties.
History.
Originally called Butler Brick Company, the firm was founded in 1873 five miles east of Elgin, Texas. Irish immigrant bricklayer Michael Butler discovered clay pits at the site shortly after the Texas and New Orleans Railroad arrived there in 1871. The community that grew up around it came to be known as Butler, a company town with a company store and brick houses for employees who farmed on the side.
The town's population reached about 150 and the company also mined clay from a site now in the Zilker Park soccer fields in Austin. The clay was transported in buckets hung from mule-drawn lines to kilns on the site of the present-day Austin High School. Another plant was located farther down the Colorado River at the site of the Zachary Scott Theatre. In 1912 the firm acquired the Austin Brick Company, and in 1965 it acquired its chief competitor, Elgin Standard Brick Company. The company supplied bricks for the Texas State Capitol, 80 percent of the brick structures at the University of Texas at Austin, fireplaces in many Austin residences, and many other brick buildings in Austin. Brick from the firm was also used for the façade of the United States Embassy in Mexico City.

Ptolus

Ptolus is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game written by Monte Cook. It was published by Malhavoc Press on August 10, 2006. Ptolus is also the name of the city featured in the campaign. It has received good reviews, and won the 2007 ENnie award for Product of the Year.
Setting.
Ptolus is based upon the setting for Cook's home game, which served as the initial campaign for the 3rd edition of "Dungeons and Dragons". The campaign centers around the city of the same name, which lies on the Whitewind Sea at the edges of the crumbling empire of Tarsis. The city lies in the shadow of an impossibly tall and narrow spire. Below the city are many dungeons, including the city's sewers and a forgotten dwarven city named Dwarvenhearth.
The book's author claims it is the "most deluxe roleplaying product ever published," weighing in at 672 pages with multiple special features, including a CD-ROM that includes a new adventure, "The Night of Dissolution," and two previous Malhavoc products with Ptolus connections: "The Banewarrens" and "Chaositech." The book was produced in hardback on full colour glossy paper. The first 1,000 pre-ordered copies of the Ptolus book had their copy signed and numbered by Monte Cook and also received a printed copy of "The Night of Dissolution", which was not otherwise available at the time, and five copies of "A Player's Guide to Ptolus".
"A Player's Guide to Ptolus" consists of the material of Chapter 1 of "Ptolus". It was available for separate sale from several months before "Ptolus" either individually or in packs of five. As well as five copies coming free with pre-orders of "Ptolus", it is also available in PDF format on CD that comes with all printed copies of the "Ptolus" book and available for free download. The contents of this book is designed to represent the common knowledge available to city residents or visitors to Ptolus. It is intended that each player in a Ptolus campaign should have access to a copy of this book.
World.
The world of Ptolus is called Praemal. 80% of its surface is covered with water, and it is currently in an ice age. The planet has two visible moons, and allegedly a third that disappeared eons ago.
Chaositech.
The technology of Ptolus is slightly better than usually found in other fantasy settings. Gunpowder and clockworks are quite mundane. In addition to "normal" technology, there is also chaositech, which is a mixture of fantasy settings' magic items and cyberpunks' cyberwares. It is considered an abomination in the world, although there are a few who consider it to hold great potential and would sell their own soul for a piece of it - as they usually do. As can be discerned from the name, this technology originates from chaos. Some of the greatest experts in chaositech are the drow.
New Races.
Although Praemal is populated by the standard D&D races, there are few new races as well, and some twist in the original races, too. Races that are considered savage in other settings are civilized people in Ptolus, like the minotaurs.
Shoal elves.
Seafaring elves; in the world of Ptolus, elves must sleep, and therefore they don't have the immunity of sleep spells and effects.
Harrow elves.
Despite the fact that dark elves exist in the world of Praemal (and, as usual, are greatly feared and despised), there is another twisted kind of elves. The harrow elves, which were created by Ghul, are terribly deformed and considered second-class citizens by most of Ptolus. They are very much like the orc race from Tolkien's mythos, elves that have been perverted by a powerful overlord. They are considered more apt to be tempted by evil and most often do not have good family lives. (Since every child produced by a harrow elf will be a harrow elf, there is a common conception that the race has a tendency towards rape.) Harrow elves have considerable magic abilities, and their favorite class is monk.
Cherubim elves.
Winged elves, who are more fragile, but very swift, too. They usually live in the mountains, and do not interfere with the life of other mortals. They have thin bones and pale skin.
Litorians.
Humanoid lions, who have a very strong sense of honour. They have extraordinary physical abilities and senses. This race also appears in The Diamond Throne, the setting introduced in Monte Cook's Arcana Unearthed.

Oscar Castillo

Oscar Aníbal Castillo (born 18 January 1954) is an Argentine Radical Civic Union (UCR) politician, currently a Senator for the Civic and Social Front of Catamarca and a former governor of that province. He is the son of the late Arnoldo Castillo, a leading figure in the Catamarca UCR.
Castillo was born in San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca. He studied at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral becoming a lawyer. He was active in student politics, serving as secretary of his faculty's student union and representing his university at the "Federación Universitaria de Buenos Aires" in 1980. He married the former Silvia Brocal, an accountant, and had two children.
Castillo has held high office in the UCR. He was President of the UCR youth wing in Catamarca Province (1981–83), and represented his province on the UCR national committee, in 1990-96 and 2001–04, and was vice-president and treasurer of the party. 
Castillo served as a provincial deputy (legislator) in Catamarca (1985–89), and was UCR-MPC caucus leader. He was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1989 and reelected, serving until 1997. Castillo ran for and was elected governor of Catamarca in 1999, serving until 2003. His tenure was marked by debates regarding the separation of church and state. Castillo, who had taken his oath as a legislator without mentioning God in two previous occasions, imposed mandatory religious education of a Roman Catholic nature in Catamarca schools; protest from the province's sizable Jewish community and others led to the policy's rescission in 2001, however.
Catamarca voters returned him to the Senate upon completion of his term as governor. His reelection campaign, however, was followed by a challenge of the results amid accusations of vote buying and collusion with Governor Eduardo Brizuela del Moral to that effect; his personal estate, which includes at least a dozen properties in the province, has also come under scrutiny.

Prince La La

Prince La La born Lawrence Nelson (1936 - 1963), from the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, was a songwriter and vocalist who released a couple of classic R&B recordings before his death from a drug overdose at 27.
Lawrence Nelson was born into a family rooted in the rich musical tradition of New Orleans. His father, Walter Nelson, was a noted jazz and R&B guitarist who played with R&B pioneer Smiley Lewis. His elder brother, Walter "Papoose" Nelson Jr., played extensively in the 50s and early 60s with Fats Domino and Professor Longhair, and was a featured session guitarist for seminal New Orleans bandlander and producer Dave Bartholomew. Sister Dorothy was married to the singer, songwriter and producer Jessie Hill.
It was Jessie Hill who was responsible for Nelson, who started out as a songwriter, becoming a recording artist. In 1961 Hill brought his latest discovery, 19-year-old Barbara George, in for a debut recording session with Harold Battiste's newly founded A.F.O. (All For One) label. Hill proposed that she sing Nelson's song "She Put the Hurt on Me", and played a demo with Nelson's vocal for her and Battiste to hear. Battiste liked Nelson's version so much he decided to
have Nelson sing the song instead and in 1962 it became the first release by the A.F.O. label, b/w "Don’t You Know Little Girl (I'm In Love)". (Barbara George would have a R&B #1 with her own composition "I Know (You Don't Love Me No More)" when A.F.O. issued its second release a little later.)
"She Put the Hurt on Me" was a national hit, reaching #14 on the R&B charts. It was credited to Prince La La - "La La" being Lawrence's nickname, and "Prince" tying in with the African prince costume adopted by Nelson in P.R. photos.
Nelson followed up with a second single at the tail-end of 1962, the Charley Julien song "Gettin’ Married Soon", b/w "Come Back To Me".
And that was it, Nelson suffering a drug overdose in 1963. It's notable that earlier the previous year, on the 28th February, 1962, Lawrence's brother Papoose died aged 31 in New York, also from a drug overdose.
Nelson's death was the subject of Oliver Morgan's 1964 hit song "Who Shot the La La?"
A further two Prince La La recordings are extant: "Things Have Changed", and a Jessie Hill song, "Need You".

Dissimilar air combat training

Dissimilar air combat training (DACT) was introduced as a formal part of US air combat training after disappointing aerial combat exchange rates in the Vietnam War.
Traditionally, pilots would undertake air combat training against similar aircraft. For example, pilots of F-8s would seldom train against F-4 Phantom IIs, and almost never against A-4 Skyhawks and never as part of a formal syllabus. From 1965 to 1968, US pilots found themselves over the skies of North Vietnam pitted against the smaller, more nimble subsonic Soviet MiG-17 and the supersonic MiG-21. US pilots in USAF F-105 Thunderchiefs were barely able to exceed parity, and pilots in Phantoms and Crusaders were not able to achieve the hugely lopsided win/loss ratio achieved over Korea and in World War II. In fact, Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) was not practiced by all fighter squadrons for a variety of reasons.
The USAF had deemphasized ACM since most air combat doctrine since the late 1950s, centered around delivering nuclear weapons over Europe, or firing missiles at beyond visual range at bombers, not daylight dogfighting, which was thought to be obsolete in the missile age. The primary US fighter used against North Vietnamese MiGs, the F-4 Phantom, did not even have an internal gun. Yet, US pilots were finding themselves hard-pressed to prevail over the nimble VPAF MiGs and by late 1966, they had grown to be a real threat to US aircraft operating over the North.
Even more vexing were rules of engagement (ROE) that did not even permit beyond-visual-range (BVR) firing of missiles. Radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrows experienced high failure rates, and the short range Sidewinder was ineffective in many dogfighting maneuvering situations.
It was found that Phantom training against other Phantoms did not reflect the reality of a target that was smaller, smokeless, and more agile. Ever since the success of the American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers), aerial tacticians have advocated exploiting known differences in aircraft to maximize one's own advantages while minimizing the disadvantages of one's own platform, thus neutralizing the superior maneuverability and climbing speed of, for example, a Zero compared to the rugged, fast-diving and powerfully armed P-40 Tomahawk. However, US pilots found themselves the victims of VPAF MiG-21s using Chennault's Flying Tiger tactics of hit and run attacks successfully against them.
In 1968, the Navy took a hard look at its air-to-air problems over North Vietnam and tasked Captain Frank Ault to come up with recommendations to improve the situation. His report became known as the Ault Report and it resulted in establishment of TOPGUN and incorporation of DACT into the syllabus. The United States Navy Fighter Weapons School adopted the nimble subsonic A-4 Skyhawk to simulate subsonic Soviet fighters, while the F-5E Tiger simulated the supersonic MiG-21 Fishbed fighter. Both the Skyhawk and Tiger were used in the 1986 film "Top Gun". After aerial combat resumed again in 1972 over North Vietnam, the Navy had numerous TOPGUN graduates who were ready to take on the VPAF MiG-17, MiG-19 and MiG-21 pilots that had also been training and were prepared for the resumption of hostilities. The Navy's exchange ratio soared to over 20:1 before loss of a Marine Phantom brought it to 12.5:1 by 1973; an unqualified testament to the value of the TOPGUN approach and DACT. The USAF did not improve its exchange ratio at all in the same timeframe and hurriedly began to adopt DACT even inviting Navy F-8 Crusaders to visit a base in Thailand in 1972 to conduct DACT with the F-4 Phantoms based there.
The A-4 Skyhawk has since been replaced by the T-45 Goshawk, a navalized British Hawk trainer. F-16s have been used to simulate later generation Soviet fighters such as the MiG-29. The now-retired F-14 Tomcat was also used in various paint schemes to simulate Iranian F-14s, as well as the large Su-27 Flanker. The Air Force has reportedly also used actual captured or purchased Soviet fighters on occasion.

Fort Buford

Fort Buford was a United States Army Post at the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers in Dakota Territory, present day North Dakota, and the site of Sitting Bull's surrender in 1881.
Company C, 2nd Battalion, 13th Infantry, 3 officers, 80 enlisted men and 6 civilians commanded by Capt. (Brevet Lt. Col.) William G. Rankin, first established a camp on the site on June 15, 1866, with orders to build a post, the majority of which was built using adobe and cottonwood enclosed by a wooden stockade. The fort was named after the late Major General John Buford, a Union Army cavalry general during the American Civil War.
Lakota attacks.
The second night after arrival the camp was attacked by a band of the Hunkpapa Lakota led by Sitting Bull, they were driven off with one soldier wounded. The next day, the same group attacked and attempted to drive off the company's herd of beef cattle, but were repulsed and two Lakota killed. Parties of men cutting and rafting logs from the mouth of the Yellowstone were often attacked and driven to camp, where the fighting often lasted from two to six hours with losses on both sides.
Hard Winter.
Three civilian wood cutters were killed at the mouth of the Yellowstone in December. Lieut. Hiram H. Ketchum with sixty men reacted, drove off the Indians and recovered the bodies with slight loss to his detachment. According to the regimental history, the Lakota boasted that they intended to annihilate the soldiers and during the winter they besieged the post. The siege cut off the garrison from the nearby Missouri River and forced them to sink shallow wells near their quarters in order to obtain fresh water. The shallow well water they drank was contaminated, by the post's livestock and/or human waste, and caused dysentery. From December 21–24 a large group of the Hunkpapas repeatedly attacked and captured the post's ice house and sawmill located near the river and opened fire on the post. The attackers were not repelled until Rankin ordered his two 12 pound Napoleons to return fire. Captain Rankin's wife spent the winter in camp, enduring the hardships and dangers with the troops in garrison.
Fort Buford Massacre Hoax.
The harassing raids and resulting lack of communication from the isolated post led to the perpetration of a hoax, the "Fort Buford Massacre", purporting that the fort had been wiped out, Capt. Rankin captured and tortured to death, and Rankin's wife captured and abused. The episode began when the "Philadelphia Inquirer" ran a story April 1, 1867, based on a letter allegedly written from the fort, which was then picked up and run the next day nationwide. It was given "legs" by a letter published April 6 in the "Army and Navy Journal", attributed to the wife of a prominent Army officer, confirming the massacre. Although by April 4 many newspapers had begun to question the validity of the report, The "Chicago Daily Times", "Detroit Free Press", "New York Daily Tribune", "New York Times", and "Boston Herald", among others, continued to feed the rumors with further stories for another month, many of them accusing the Army and the Johnson Administration of covering up the massacre. The hoax was eventually exposed by Rankin himself in correspondence to the war department.
Although the general harassing by the Lakota of Fort Buford lasted until the early 1870s, the worst was during that first year, June 1866 to May 1867. In May, the Missouri River thawed allowing the sternwheeler steamboat "Graham" to reinforce the garrison with additional riverboats arriving in June carrying Companies B, F, G, and part of E thereby enabling the garrison to better defend itself and allow for more permanent structures to be built.
Construction phases.
With the arrival of Companies B, F, G, and E, Fort Buford was expanded in 1867-1868 from the original 1866 one-company 360-foot square frontier stockade to a 540 x 1,080 feet 5 company fort with only three walls towards the West, North, and East. The South side, while not being walled off, was enclosed by the long portion of a reverse "L" of adobe barracks buildings and the Missouri River towards the South served as a natural moat. The reconstructed barracks on the site today is on the location of where the original that formed the short leg of the "L" was. In 1867, old Fort Union, A fur trading post dating back to 1829 and located 2 miles away by land, 7 by river, was bought by the Army and parts of it were demolished and used at Fort Buford during this construction phase. The reason being that the wood there had 30 years worth of age and was of superior quality to the green cottonwood available along the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers where the only native wood grew.
The post was expanded again in 1871-1872 with the arrival of Colonel William B. Hazen's 6th Infantry Regiment to a six-company infantry post covering approximately a square mile, including laundress' quarters and other civilian areas, using lumber shipped from the Eastern United States by steamboat but with no stockade. At that time the fighting had moved further westward into Montana Territory and the garrison was large enough to no-longer need the perimeter stockade. The original Commanding Officer's Quarters at the site today was part of this expansion and originally built in 1871-1872 and served as Hazen's residence from 1872-1880. This structure sits at the southern end of what once was a double row of Officer's Quarters that ran towards the North. Beyond this double row the stone Powder Magazine was built in 1875 out of sandstone quarried from an area located to the North of the fort. When in use the magazine held over a million rounds of ammunition for the fort's garrison, much of it being black powder cartridges one of which was the .45-70. At this time Fort Buford became a key element in the supply route for the military campaigns of 1876–1877 in Montana Territory. At the peak of occupation, which followed the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876 until 1881, there were just under 100 buildings and approximately 1,000 people occupying the post at any given moment including infantry and cavalry companies bivouacking in tents on the parade ground while being resupplied.
Following the 1871-1872 expansion there were several improvements to the fort. In 1873-1874 the 6 adobe barracks from the 1867-1868 expansion were rehabilitated in order to stabilize their crumbling adobe, this was done by adding wood sheathing to the outside of the building protecting it from the weather as well as plastering the interior and replacing the sod roof with a new lighter roof covered with tar and gravel. At the same time, the kitchen and mess hall for each barracks was relocated from the main building to a new addition connected by a short hallway. This new addition was built using the same quality lumber from the Eastern States as used in the other buildings of the 1871-1872 expansion, the existing reconstruction represents what the original building would have looked like in 1876. By 1880 however, all of the remaining adobe barracks buildings were collapsing, with a few having already collapsed and forcing the men to bivouac in tents on the parade ground. By 1881, the adobe structures were torn down and replaced with wooden structures relocated to the eastern side of the parade ground. In 1883, the Commanding Officer's Quarters' bay window was pushed out to the South adding on two rooms to the structure.
In 1889, the last of the expansions took place. A much larger Commanding officer's Quarters was built on the northern end of Officer's Row replacing the 1872 Hazen Quarters which then became the Field Officer's Quarters. A water tower was built towards the river and attempts were made at installing water mains to the structures. The attempt failed however, because they could not bury the pipes deep enough to keep them from freezing every Winter with the last attempt at 8 feet.
The remoteness of the post, poor quality of its original construction, and age resulted in the fort's deterioration with many of the original adobe and cottonwood structures constantly in a state of collapse due to unskilled labor, the elements, and poor construction methods when built.
Decommissioning and the site as it is today.
Due to the settlement of the region and the poor condition of the post, Fort Buford was decommissioned by the Army on October 1, 1895. In 1896, all of the remaining structures were sold at auction to be either hauled away or torn down. All but 3 were moved: the 1872 Commanding Officer's Quarters where Sitting Bull surrendered his rifle, the 1875 stone Powder Magazine, and a Duplex Officer's Quarters. The Duplex was used as a residence and the much smaller Commanding Officer's Quarters was used as a guest house and later as a granary by the Mercer family and the grounds were called "Villa Militare" until the grounds were given to the State of North Dakota in 1927. The Duplex burned down destroying with it many artifacts in 1937. In the 1990s the former Officer of the Guard/Officer of the Day building was found being used as a pump house for the nearby irrigation canal and was relocated to its original location. In 2004, an example of an adobe barracks was built at the location of an original barracks that was there from 1867 to 1881. From archaeological findings at the site prior to its construction, it was determined that this particular barracks held Co. G 6th Infantry Regiment while the 6th Infantry was stationed at the post from 1871 to 1880. Of the approximately 1 square mile sized fort only 40 acres is currently owned by the state of North Dakota. Today the North Dakota State Historical Society runs Fort Buford as Fort Buford State Historic Site.

Connecticut Route 57

Route 57 is a secondary state highway in western Connecticut serving as the "Main Street" of and connecting the towns of Westport and Weston. The road continues north through Redding to end at US 7 just after crossing into Wilton.
Route description.
Route 57 begins as "Kings Highway North" at the west bank of the Saugatuck River at an intersection with Route 33 north of downtown Westport. After crossing the river, it turns north onto "Canal Street" then onto "Main Street". Route 57 overlaps Route 136 for between Compo Road North and Weston Road. Route 57 then turns onto "Weston Road" as it intersects with the Merritt Parkway at an interchange (Exit 42). Continuing north, Route 57 crosses over the Aspetuck River and Saugatuck River before crossing into the town of Weston. Route 57 continues through Weston center, where it briefly overlaps Route 53. Past Weston center, the road becomes "Georgetown Road" and proceeds for another four miles (6 km) through Weston until it reaches Route 107 just across the town line in Redding. Route 57 then turns west along Route 107 ("Redding Road" and "School Street"), overlapping it for into the Georgetown section of the town of Wilton. Routes 57 and 107 end concurrently at US 7 in Georgetown.
History.
Route 57 was commissioned in 1932 running from Westport center to Weston center, then along the old Newtown Turnpike to Newtown. The portion of the original route north of Weston center ran from the current northern intersection with Route 53 across Route 58 in Redding to an intersection the old US 202, now Route 302, in Newtown. In 1935, Route 57 was truncated to the intersection of the Newtown Turnpike at Route 58. In 1954, the northern part of Route 57 was relocated to its current route along Georgetown Road towards Georgetown (former alignment of Route 53). The Newtown Turnpike portion of former Route 57 became unsigned SR 725, which was assigned in 1963 to a new alignment of Route 53.

Ludwig Andreas Olsen

Ludwig Andreas Olsen (1845 – February 20, 1886), also known as Louis Williams, was a United States Navy sailor and one of only 19 people to ever be awarded two Medals of Honor. Both awards were for peace-time actions rescuing fellow seamen.
Biography.
Olsen was born in Oslo, Norway, in 1845. He joined the Navy from California in 1870, under the name Louis Williams. He eventually achieved the rank of Captain of the Hold, an enlisted position that placed him in charge of keeping order in the ship's hold.
On 16 March 1883, aboard the screw sloop-of-war off Honolulu, Hawaii, Olsen jumped overboard and saved a fellow sailor from drowning. The next year, on 13 June 1884 off the coast of Callao, Peru, Olsen again saved a man from drowning, along with Ordinary Seaman Isaac L. Fasseur. For each of these peace-time actions he was awarded a Medal of Honor; Fasseuer also received the medal for the 1884 rescue. Both medals were presented to Olsen on 18 October 1884, making him one of only 19 people to receive two Medals of Honor and one of only 14 people to receive two Medals of Honor for two separate acts. Both medals were awarded under the name he had enlisted with, Louis Williams.
Olsen's awards were for peace-time actions; it can be argued that today he would be awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.
Olsen died on 20 February 1886 and is buried in Cypress Hills National Cemetery, Section 6, Grave 12616, in Brooklyn, New York City, New York.

Jean Baptiste Christophore Fusée Aublet

Jean Baptiste Christophore Fusée Aublet (November 4, 1720 – May 6, 1778) was a French pharmacist, botanist and explorer.
Born in Salon-de-Provence, he joined the French East India Company and in 1752 was sent to Mauritius (then known as "l'Île de France") to establish a pharmacy and a botanical garden. He worked there for nine years. During this time he was accused of having destroyed plants from the collection of Pierre Poivre, being jealous of the latter's success.
In 1762 he was sent to Cayenne in French Guiana, where he assembled a vast herbarium which allowed him to prepare his "Histoire des plantes de la Guiane françoise", published in 1775 and including almost 400 copperplate engravings.
When Fusée Aublet died at Paris in 1778, he left his herbarium to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, though the latter possessed it for only two months before he too died. It was eventually acquired by the "Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle" in 1953.

<doc id="5921769" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5921769" title="Human artificial chromosome">
Human artificial chromosome

A human artificial chromosome (HAC) is a microchromosome that can act as a new chromosome in a population of human cells. That is, instead of 46 chromosomes, the cell could have 47 with the 47th being very small, roughly 6-10 megabases (Mb) in size instead of 50-250 Mb for natural chromosomes, and able to carry new genes introduced by human researchers. Ideally, researchers could integrate different genes that perform a variety of functions, including disease defense.
Alternative methods of creating transgenes, such as utilizing yeast artificial chromosomes and bacterial artificial chromosomes, lead to unpredictable problems. The genetic material introduced by these vectors not only leads to different expression levels, but the inserts also disrupt the original genome. HACs differ in this regard, as they are entirely separate chromosomes. This separation from existing genetic material assumes that no insertional mutants would arise. This stability and accuracy makes HACs preferable to other methods such as viral vectors, YACs and BACs. HACs allow for delivery of more DNA (including promoters and copy-number variation) than is possible with viral vectors.
Yeast artificial chromosomes and bacterial artificial chromosomes were created before human artificial chromosomes, which first appeared in 1997. HACs are useful in expression studies as gene transfer vectors, as a tool for elucidating human chromosome function, and as a method for actively annotating the human genome.
History.
HACs were first constructed "de novo" in 1997 by adding alpha-satellite DNA to telomeric and genomic DNA in human HT1080 cells. This resulted in an entirely new microchromosome that contained DNA of interest, as well as elements allowing it to be structurally and mitotically stable, such as telomeric and centromeric sequences. Due to the difficulty of "de novo" HAC formation, this method has been largely abandoned.
HAC Construction.
There are currently two accepted models for the creation of human artificial chromosome vectors. The first is to create a small minichromosome by altering a natural human chromosome. This is accomplished by truncating the natural chromosome, followed by the introduction of unique genetic material via the Cre-Lox system of recombination. The second method involves the literal creation of a novel chromosome "de novo". Progress regarding "de novo" HAC formation has been limited, as many large genomic fragments will not successfully integrate into "de novo" vectors. Another factor limiting "de novo" vector formation is limited knowledge of what elements are required for construction, specifically centromeric sequences.
Applications.
In 2010, a refined human artificial chromosome called 21HAC was reported. 21HAC is based on a stripped copy of human chromosome 21, producing a chromosome 5 Mb in length. Truncation of chromosome 21 resulted in a human artificial chromosome that is mitotically stable. 21HAC was also able to be transferred into cells from a variety of species (mice, chickens, humans). Using 21HAC, researchers were able to insert a herpes simplex virus- thymidine kinase coding gene into tumor cells. This "suicide gene" is required to activate many antiviral medications. These targeted tumor cells were successfully, and selectively, terminated by the antiviral drug ganciclovir in a population including healthy cells. This research opens a variety of opportunities for using HACs in gene therapy.
In 2011, researchers formed a human artificial chromosome by truncating chromosome 14. Genetic material was then introduced as mentioned above, using the Cre-Lox recombination system. This particular study focused on changes in expression levels by leaving portions of the existing genomic DNA. By leaving existing telomeric and sub-telomeric sequences, they were able to amplify expression levels of genes coding for erythropoietin production over 1000-fold. This work also has large gene therapy implications, as erythropoietin controls red blood cell formation.
A 2009 study has shown additional benefits of HACs, namely their ability to stably contain extremely large genomic fragments. Researchers incorporated the 2.4 Mb dystrophin gene, in which a mutation is a key causal element of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The resulting HAC was mitotically stable, and correctly expressed dystrophin in chimeric mice. Previous attempts at correctly expressing dystrophin have failed. Due to its large size, it has never before been successfully integrated into a vector.
HACs have been used to create transgenic animals for use as animal models of human disease and for production of therapeutic products

Television presenter

A television presenter is a person who introduces or hosts television programmes. Nowadays it is common for minor celebrities in other fields to take on this role, but there are also a number of people who have made their name solely within the field of presenting, particularly within children's television series to become a television personality.
Roles.
Some presenters may double as an actor, model, singer, comedian etc. Others may be subject matter experts, such as scientists or politicians, serving as presenters for a programme about their field of expertise (for instance, David Attenborough). Some are celebrities who have made their name in one area, then leverage their fame to get involved in other areas. Examples of this latter group include British comedian Michael Palin who now presents programmes about travel (such as ""), and Alan Alda, who has presented "Scientific American Frontiers" for over a decade. Another example would be American stand-up comedian Joe Rogan, who is a commentator and post-fight interviewer in UFC.
The term is also use in other countries, such as Ireland and Sri Lanka. In the USA, such a person is typically called a host or an MC (Master of Ceremonies).

Villa Opicina

Villa Opicina, also spelled Opicina (, Triestine: "Opcina"), is a town in north-eastern Italy, close to the Slovenian border at Fernetti (). The first town in Slovenia after the border is Sežana, which is also where the first railway station in Slovenia is located after Villa Opicina. It is a "frazione" of the "comune" of Trieste, the provincial and regional capital.
Geography.
It is located on the Carso Plateau 3 miles north of Trieste, a seaport on the Adriatic Sea.
The railway station serves trains entering Italy from Slovenia, but does not provide a direct service to Trieste. The Opicina Tramway, a unique hybrid tramway and funicular railway links Villa Opicina village with "Piazza Oberdan" in Trieste city centre. There are also buses which link Villa Opicina railway station, the village center and Trieste.
History and culture.
Population.
It is mostly inhabited by a Slovene minority in Italy. According to the last Austrian census of 1911, over 89% of the population was of Slovene ethnicity. In the following decades, this number fell significantly: according to the census of 1971, just above half of the population of the settlement belonged to the Slovene speaking community, while the rest were mostly Italian speakers. 
In the last three decades, immigration from the city of Trieste and other predominantly Italian-speaking areas have most probably reduced the Slovene speakers to a minority. However, Slovene language is still widely used in the settlement, both in private and public life. Most of the official signs are bilingual, Italian and Slovene.
The local Slovenes speak a distinctive version of the Inner Carniolan dialect, which shows strong influences of the neighboring Karst dialect.
Name.
The name Opicina is of Slovene origin (meaning 'community'), thus being one of the many Italian towns and villages in Friuli-Venezia Giulia with a name of Slavic origin. Before World War I, it used to be known in Italian as Opcina, a name still used in the local Triestine dialect. During the Fascist regime, the name was first Italianized into Villa Opicina, and subsequently renamed to Poggioreale del Carso. In 1966 it was renamed again into Villa Opicina. However, it has been frequently referred simply as Opicina, including in the road signs.

Albert Weisbogel

Albert Weisbogel (1844 – May 27, 1919) was a 19th-century United States Navy sailor. He was twice awarded America's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for peace-time actions (for which he would now be awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal). He is one of only 19 people to be awarded two Medals of Honor, and one of only 14 to be awarded the Medal twice for two separate actions.
Biography.
Weisbogel was born in 1844 in New Orleans, Louisiana. He joined the Navy from Louisiana and by January 11, 1874, was serving on the . On that day, one of his shipmates, a U.S. Marine named Wolf, jumped overboard in a "fit of insanity" in an attempt to commit suicide by drowning. Weisbogel jumped in after and saved him. For this action, he was awarded a Medal of Honor two years later, on March 23, 1876. By that time, he was serving as Captain of the Mizzen Top on the . Weisbogel also at one point served on the and performed a similar feat on that ship.
Barely a month after being awarded his first Medal of Honor, on April 27, 1876, he again saved a crewmate from drowning. While "Plymouth" was entering the harbor of Kingston, Jamaica, Landsman Peter J. Kenny fell overboard and was rescued by Weisbogel. For that action he was awarded his second Medal of Honor, on June 9, 1876.
Weisbogel died at age 74 or 75 and was buried in an unmarked grave at Holy Cross Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.
Medal of Honor citations.
Weisbogel's official Medal of Honor citations are as follows:
For gallant conduct in jumping overboard from the U.S.S. "Benicia", at sea, and rescuing from drowning one of the crew of that vessel on 11 January 1874.
For gallant conduct in jumping overboard from the U.S.S. "Plymouth", at sea, and rescuing from drowning one of the crew of that vessel on 27 April 1876.

Carmel Jackson

Carmel Jackson (previously Roberts) is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Judith Jacob from 5 June 1986 to 24 August 1989. Carmel, a Health Visitor, was initially introduced in a recurring, minor role in 1986. Producers saw potential in the character, and script writers were asked to develop more promienent storylines, and Carmel became a regular character. She is portrayed as a well-meaning, caring individual who is forever getting everyone's problems dumped on her. She is featured in storylines about domestic violence and various family and career upsets. Jacob remained in the role until 1989, when she opted to leave. Off-screen, the character was the subject of criticism regarding the portrayal of her profession from the Health Visitors Association.
Storylines.
Carmel is first seen in Walford in June 1986 when she is assigned as Michelle Fowler's (Susan Tully) health visitor. West Indian by origin, British by education, Carmel is unmistakable with her long dreadlocks and colourful clothing. Carmel is kept extremely busy in Walford as she has all the difficult cases - Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), a prostitute, whose baby, Annie, has been removed; Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), a mentally unstable mother who is obsessed with her baby, Ali's, welfare; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), a self-destructing heroin addict, and jobless Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), among others. 
In December 1986, Carmel starts dating Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), much to his parents' dismay. Carmel later moves into the ground floor flat at number 3 Albert Square and she and Kelvin live together for a while. However, their age difference takes its toll on Carmel, who grows tired of Kelvin's immature behaviour. She eventually throws Kelvin out after publicly dumping him in The Queen Victoria public house. 
Shortly after Carmel moves to the Square, her brother Darren (Gary McDonald) and his children, Junior (Aaron Carrington) and Aisha (Aisha Jacob), join her. Darren and Carmel are complete opposite of each other; Darren is inconsiderate and often dabbles on the wrong side of the law with dodgy scams, such as porn video laundering and instigating a counterfeit money ring. Carmel despairs over his thoughtless behaviour and criminal antics, but he ignores her and she regularly takes over caring for his two young children. Junior proves to be troublesome, and after Carmel discovers that he has been playing truant from school for some time, she reports Darren to the truancy officer as an irresponsible parent. This does not please Darren and he is even more annoyed when Carmel refuses flatly to put up with his behaviour any longer. Animosity between the two increases when Carmel starts dating Matthew Jackson (Steven Hartley) later that year; Darren is unhappy about his sister dating a white man. Carmel defends Matthew against her brother's racism, and after Darren cons Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt), she throws him out. Darren then leaves alone, leaving his children so Carmel sends them to her parents as she only has a one bedroom flat. 
In September 1988, Matthew moves into Carmel's flat and the two are soon engaged. Matthew is well liked in the community, even convincing Carmel's skeptical father that he is genuine and Carmel begins planning their wedding. She wants to invite Matthew's mother, Lynna, but he is opposed to this as Lynna abandoned him at 15 and has had no subsequent contact. Carmel and Matthew marry in January 1989, but the day is ruined when Matthew sees his mother there. Carmel contacted her regardlesss, thinking Matthew would be pleased, but he is furious. After shunning their reception party, Matthew threatens to leave Carmel and when she tries to stop him, he grabs her by the throat, holds her up against a wall and berates her for her interference. Carmel is petrified and upon seeing her fear, Matthew releases her and begins apologising profusely. Carmel is shaken, but Matthew convinces her that his apology is sincere, so she drops the matter. 
More problems arise for the newlyweds when Carmel's sister, Maxine (Ella Wilder), announces that their parents can't cope with Junior and Aisha. She states that if Carmel does not take the children, they will be put into care. Matthew is unwilling but after Carmel's father has a stroke, Maxine brings the children to Carmel so they move in with her and Matthew. He resents them as Carmel's time is being diverted from him; finding Junior, in particular, difficult to cope with. They regularly clash, causing further animosity between Matthew and Carmel and Matthew becomes violent again, punching Carmel during an argument about Junior. She has some nasty bruises but once again a tearful Matthew convinces her to forgive him. Matthew's behaviour alternates between contrite and caring to hot-tempered and violent, for seemingly no reason. Nevertheless, Carmel loves him and stays with him as she believes she can help him combat and contain his rage but Junior soon realises why his aunt is constantly bruised and tries to stop the violence by telling people about the abuse but this only makes matters worse. Matthew becomes irrationally jealous of Carmel's friendship with Dr. David Samuels (Christopher Reich), and during a family meal, he turns violent again and attempting to protect Carmel, Junior stabs Matthew with a kitchen knife and he is rushed to hospital, where he tries to convince Carmel that he has changed. She allows him to come home and tries to get him professional help but Matthew refuses, appalled by the idea and begins smashing up the house and threatening Carmel with more violence. Finally realising that she cannot help Matthew, Carmel ends their relationship. She throws Matthew out and he leaves Walford in July 1989. The following month, Carmel's father dies, so she leaves Walford with Junior and Aisha to look after her mother. Her last appearance is in August 1989.
Character creation.
In July 1984, before "EastEnders" went to air, the show's creators, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, attended an opening evening at the Anna Scher Theatre School in North London, in order to find actors for roles in their upcoming serial. According to Holland and Smith, Anna Scher's school was unlike many other drama schools, where students were "ironed out", all looking and sounding the same. At Anna Scher's school, students' natural personalities and accents were encouraged, "her students aren't taught how to act, they're helped to dig inside themselves and be." In Holland and Smith's own words, this was "just the sort of non-acting that ["EastEnders"] was looking for".
Often, former students who were already working in the acting profession attended Scher's classes, and on the night Holland and Smith attended, actress Judith Jacob performed. Holland and Smith described Jacob as "an old friend", as they had previously worked with her on their medical drama "Angels", where Jacob had played nurse Beverley Slater between 1979 and 1981. Following the end of the class, Holland and Smith concluded that Judith Jacob "had been as good as ever", but that "there wasn't really a part for her" in the original character line-up. 
However, in 1986, a year after the soap had first aired, Jacob was recruited by Julia Smith and offered a part in the serial, the minor role of Carmel Roberts, a health visitor who tended to the character Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) after the birth of her baby Vicki. In his book, "EastEnders: The First 10 Years", author and "EastEnders" scriptwriter Colin Brake has used Carmel as an example of the way minor characters can develop in "EastEnders": "Often a new character is introduced for a limited number of episodes, to serve a particular storyline or the story function. If the casting is good and the character 'works' on the screen, then the writers may be asked if there is potential in the character for further appearances." This occurred with the character of Carmel, and later in 1986 she was reintroduced as a regular character, moving to the soap's focal setting of Albert Square.
Character development.
As Walford's health visitor, Carmel's principal purpose was to act as an advisor to the troubled residents of Albert Square. In the "EastEnders Handbook", author Hilary Kingsley describes Carmel as "saintly by nature", adding "if anyone deserved a medal for patience it was Carmel Roberts when she was working as Albert Square's health visitor".
In 1987, an extended family was introduced for Carmel, including her brother Darren (Gary McDonald), and his two children Junior (Aaron Carrington) and Aisha (Aisha Jacob). According to the "EastEnders Handbook", parents of young child actors were sometimes upset unavoidably during filming of "EastEnders". For instance, the parents of the baby who played Hassan Osman were affected when their baby was used in a storyline about cot death, as they had not been warned. This problem was avoided with the two-year-old girl who played Carmel's niece, Aisha Roberts, as she was the real-life daughter of actress Judith Jacob. The writers "obligingly" called the young character Aisha, to make it less confusing for the actors. The idea to use Jacob's real daughter had come from the serial's co-creator Julia Smith. Jacob was initially against the idea. In an interview she commented, "Children on the set can be so horrible", due to awkwardness inherent in disciplining someone else’s child in the workplace. However, she has said that she found it hard to turn Julia Smith down, and realised that she would get to spend more time with her daughter if she also was working on the set of "EastEnders". This caused a problem once on-screen, when Aisha referred to Carmel as "mummy", even though Aisha’s character was not Carmel’s daughter. Despite the inconsistency, the producers left the scene in. 
Carmel's storylines included a brief relationship with a toyboy, Kelvin Carpenter (Paul Medford), and numerous family and career-based problems. In 1988, Carmel gained a new partner, a white man named Matthew Jackson, played by Steven Hartley. The characters were shown to marry in a register office in January 1989, beginning a domestic violence storyline. By March 1989, Matthew was beating Carmel. This was the first time that "EastEnders" had dealt with the issue of domestic violence. After several months of abuse, a "particularly violent" incident ended with Junior stabbing Matthew with a kitchen knife to protect his aunt. By July 1989, the marriage "was as good as dead". Jacob has commented, "It was a great part to play. People couldn’t understand how a professional woman can stay with someone who beats her. That shows the durability of the character." 
Jacob opted to leave the serial in 1989, and she has since commented that "They didn’t want me to leave, and made me a couple of offers to stay", but leaving seemed like the right thing to do at the time. On-screen Carmel's marriage collapsed, and the following month her father died, so she left Walford to tend to her grieving mother. She last appeared in August 1989.
Reception.
Co-creator of "EastEnders", Julia Smith, has been quoted as saying, "Our EastEnd setting was chosen for the diversity of its past — the strong culture it has and the multi-racial community that has developed." However, the way that "EastEnders" treated their black characters during the 1980s has been criticized. Stephen Bourne, author of "Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television" has commented that "["EastEnders"'] black characters have rarely been as interesting as their white counterparts, or been given storylines of any substance...Viewers were more likely to tune in to watch the antics of Dirty Den, his wife Angie and bad boy Nick Cotton, than characters like the Carpenter family and Carmel." In Robert Clyde Allen's book, "To be Continued--: Soap Operas Around the World", Christine Geraghty has added "none of the black families "EastEnders" rivaled the Fowler/Beale position at the heart of the programme's structure, and black characters were pushed to the margins of the story-lines. Carmel and [her brother Darren clearly had an extended family along the lines of the Fowler/Beale nexus but its other members were rarely seen."
Conversely, in "The Black and White Media Show Book", edited by John Twitchin of BBC TV's Continuing Education Department (published in 1988), "EastEnders" is praised for portraying black people on mainstream television, and for giving them "respectable, fleshed-out parts which allow them to be the most difficult of things — 'normal people'." Additionally, actress Judith Jacob has said that she looks back on her three years in "EastEnders" only with "delight". She has also said that she disagrees with the criticism "EastEnders" gets for paying "token lip service to blacks and minorities, who are usually depicted stereotypically." In 2006, she commented to the "Walford Gazette", ""EastEnders" was the only show to employ black actors. soap "Coronation Street" just recently started bringing in black characters. There has always been a good flow of people in "EastEnders"."
Further criticism has been aimed at Carmel's portrayal as a health visitor. In the late 1980s, a specialist nursing magazine called "Nursing Times" had a feature on the character, remarking that she "has come in for quite a bit of stick from HVA Visitors Association members who haven't felt that the character gives a good impression of their role". HVA members expressed disappointment that the character "has not developed in a way which promotes the role of health visitors more positively." Roma Iskander, who had discussed the role with "EastEnders" scriptwriters on behalf of the HVA, said that "Carmel isn't a positive image of a black woman or a health visitor." The magazine article suggested that Carmel's personal problems with family and clients served her right "for moving to Albert Square in the first place. Health visitors be warned — don't live on your work patch". However, in Dominic Strinati's book, "Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain", Christine Geraghty has argued that "the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depended on her being part of the life of the Square, regularly and unproblematically available as a source of advice and support in her professional capacity as well as the focus of interest in terms of her personal life." Geraghty has said that tension arose from conflict in the 1980s soaps "between a desire to be positive about a particular issue and a commitment to credibility in terms of character and setting. The HVA, it would appear, want Carmel to be a model health visitor, demonstrating a wide range of skills in a professional manner. But the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depends on her being a character who is part of the life of the Square, a professional who makes mistakes and whose personal life is almost a source of interest. Quite clearly, the demands for a positive image for health visitors as a profession are less pressing than the necessiity to be able to deploy Carmel as a soap opera character. Those making the programme are quite certain that this is the way it must be."

Infrared spectroscopy correlation table

An infrared spectroscopy correlation table (or table of infrared absorption frequencies) is a list of absorption peaks and frequencies, typically reported in wavenumber, for common types of molecular bonds and functional groups. In physical and analytical chemistry, infrared spectroscopy (IR spectroscopy) is a technique used to identify chemical compounds based on the way infrared radiation is absorbed by the compound. 
The absorptions in this range do not apply only to bonds in organic molecules. IR spectroscopy is useful when it comes to analysis of inorganic compounds (such as metal complexes or fluoromanganates) as well. Phosphonates could also be characterized by two middle-sized bands between 2300 and 2400 cm−1.
Tables of vibrational transitions of stable and transient molecules are also available.

Gabriella di Vergy

Gabriella di Vergy is an "opera seria" in two acts by Gaetano Donizetti written in 1826 and revised in 1838, from a libretto by Andrea Leone Tottola, which was based on the tragedy "Gabrielle de Vergy" (1777) by Dormont De Belloy. Prior to that, the play was itself inspired by two French medieval legends, "Le châtelain de Coucy et la dame de Fayel" and "Le Roman de la chastelaine de Vergy".
The story had already been the subject of an opera by Michele Carafa (1816) and had previously been used by Johann Simon Mayr ("Raul di Créqui", Milan, 1809), Francesco Morlacchi ("Raoul de Créqui", Dresden, 1811), and Carlo Coccia ("Fayel", Florence, 1817). It was also subsequently used as "Gabriella di Vergy" by Saverio Mercadante in 1828.
"In its original form the opera was never performed", but parts of the original version were re-used by Donizetti in his other operas "Otto mesi in due ore" (Naples, 1827), "L’esule di Roma" (Naples 1828), "Il paria" (Naples 1829) and "Anna Bolena". For the revised version, Donizetti revisited "Gabriella di Vergy" and incorporated into the opera parts of "Ugo, conte di Parigi" (Milan 1832), "Rosmonda d'Inghilterra" (Florence 1834) and "Maria de Rudenz" (Venice 1838).
Performance history.
After Donizetti's death, his revised "Gabriella di Vergy" finally received its first performance on 29 November 1869 at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and with the title of "Gabriella"
The opera was rediscovered in 1978 by Don White and Patric Schmid of Opera Rara. Subsequently, it was given its first performance in the UK on 9 September 1978 in Belfast and recorded.

Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word

"Love is Just a Four-Letter Word" is a song written by Bob Dylan, and long associated with Joan Baez, who has recorded it numerous times, and performed it throughout her career. Written by Dylan somewhere around 1965, Baez immediately took to the song, and began performing it, even before it was finished. (In the film "Dont Look Back", a documentary of Dylan's 1965 tour of the UK, Baez is shown in one scene singing a fragment of the then apparently still unfinished song in a hotel room late at night. She then tells Dylan, "If you finish it, I'll sing it on a record.") Baez first included the song on "Any Day Now", her 1968 album of Dylan covers; she has since recorded it three additional times. Her 1968 recording was also released as a single.
Dylan himself appears to have never recorded the song.
Trivia.
In the 2005 PBS "American Masters" documentary on Dylan, "No Direction Home", Baez told a story of how she was with Dylan, when he first heard her recording of "Love is Just a Four-Letter Word" on the radio. He commented on it, "Hey, that's a great song!", apparently having forgotten that it was he who'd written it.
The title line "Love is just a four-letter word" derives from a line in the Tennessee Williams play "Camino Real".

Alcobaça Monastery

The Alcobaça Monastery () is a Mediaeval Roman Catholic Monastery located in the town of Alcobaça, in Oeste Subregion. It was founded by the first Portuguese King, Afonso Henriques, in 1153, and maintained a close association with the Kings of Portugal throughout its history.
The church and monastery were the first Gothic buildings in Portugal, and, together with the Monastery of Santa Cruz in Coimbra, it was one of the most important of the mediaeval monasteries in Portugal. Due to its artistic and historical importance, it was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1989.
History.
The Alcobaça Monastery is one of the first foundations of the Cistercian Order in Portugal. It was founded in 1153 as a gift to Bernard of Clairvaux, shortly before his death, from the first Portuguese King, Afonso Henriques, to commemorate his victory over the Moors at Santarém in March 1147. The foundation of the monastery was part of the strategy by Afonso Henriques to consolidate his authority in the new kingdom and promote the colonisation of areas recently taken from Moorish hands during the Reconquista.
The building of the monastery began in 1178, some 25 years after the arrival of the Cistercian monks in the Alcobaça region. Initially, the monks lived in wooden houses, and only moved to the new stone monastery buildings in 1223. The church was completed in 1252. The finished church and monastery were the first truly Gothic buildings in Portugal, and the church was the largest in Portugal. The last touch in the mediaeval ensemble was given in the late 13th century, when 
King Dinis I ordered the construction of the Gothic cloister, the "Cloister of Silence".
The monks dedicated their lives to religious meditation, creating illuminated manuscripts in a scriptorium. The monks from the monastery produced an early authoritative history on Portugal in a series of books. The library at Alcobaça was one of the largest Portuguese mediaeval libraries, but was pillaged by the invading French in 1810, and many items were stolen in an anti-clerical riot in 1834, when the religious orders in Portugal were dissolved. The remnants of the monastery library, including hundreds of mediaeval manuscripts, are kept today in the National Library in Lisbon.
During the Middle Ages, the monastery quickly became an important and powerful presence in Portugal. The monastery owned and developed extensive agriculture areas, and the abbot exerted influence over a large area. A public school was opened in 1269. The importance of the monastery can be measured by the fact that many royals were buried here in the 13th and 14th centuries. Kings Afonso II, Afonso III, and their Queens Urraca of Castile and Beatrice of Castile are buried here, as well as King Pedro I and his mistress, Inês de Castro, who was murdered on the orders of Pedro's father, King Afonso IV. After being crowned King, Pedro commissioned two magnificent Gothic tombs for him and his mistress, both of which can still be seen inside the monastery church.
During the reign of Manuel I, a second floor was added to the cloister and a new sacristy was built, following the characteristic Portuguese late Gothic known as "Manueline". The monastery was further enlarged in the 18th century, with the addition of a new cloister and towers to the church, although the mediaeval structure was mostly preserved. In the Baroque period, the monks were famous for their clay sculptures, many of them are still inside the monastery. Elaborate tiles and altarpieces completed the decoration of the church.
The great 1755 Lisbon Earthquake did not cause significant damage to the monastery, although part of the sacristy and some smaller buildings were destroyed. Greater damage was caused by invading French troops in the 1800s. In addition to looting the library, they robbed the tombs, and stole and burnt part of the inner decoration of the church. In 1834, with the dissolution of monastic life in Portugal, the last monks were ordered to leave the monastery.
Today, the Alcobaça Monastery is one of the main historic tourist destinations in Portugal.
Art and architecture.
The Alcobaça Monastery was built following an early Gothic style, and represents the arrival of this style in Portugal. The church and other main buildings were constructed from 1178 until the end of the 13th century. The church was consecrated in 1252. Following the precepts of the Order of Cistercians, the original monastic buildings were built under clean architectonic lines, without any decoration apart from some capital sculpture and a statue of the Virgin Mary.
Exterior.
The main façade of the Monastery has two plain-style wings with the church in the middle. The façade of the church is a mix of styles: the portal and the rose window above were part of the original church, while the statues and the two flanking towers were added in the beginning of the 18th century. The side walls of the church have crenellations and the apse has eight flying buttresses to support the weight of the vault of the apse, a typical feature of Gothic architecture.
Interior of the church.
The first architect(s) of the church, most probably of French origin, followed the design of the Abbey of Clairvaux (now mostly demolished), which had been founded by Bernard of Clairvaux in 1115. The church is a Latin-cross building with pronounced transept arms and three aisles. The lateral aisles of the nave are as high (20 metres) as the central one, which together with the relative slenderness of the church (17 metres) and large length (106 metres) conveys an impression of monumentality. Alcobaça remains, after 800 years, the largest Portuguese church. The vertical emphasis observed in the building is a typical gothic feature.
Columns and walls are devoid of decoration, as required in Cistercian churches, and the interior is very brightly illuminated by rows of windows on the walls and rose windows on the main façade and transept arms. The main chapel, like in Clairvaux, is surrounded by a gallery (ambulatory) and has a series of radiating chapels. The aisles are covered by simple Gothic vaulting.
Royal tombs.
In the transept of the church are located the tombs of King Pedro I and his mistress, Ines de Castro, assassinated, in 1355, under the orders of Peter's father, King Afonso IV. After becoming King, Pedro ordered the remains of his beloved to be transferred to her tomb in Alcobaça and, according to a popular legend, made her be crowned as Queen of Portugal and ordered court members to pay her homage by kissing her decomposing hand.
This pair of Royal tombs in Alcobaça, of unknown authorship, are among the best works of gothic sculpture in Portugal. The tombs are supported by lions, in the case of the King, and half-men half-beasts, in the case of Ines, and both carry the recumbent figures of the deceased assisted by a group of angels. The sides of Pedro's tomb are magnificently decorated with reliefs showing scenes from Saint Bartholomew's life, as well as scenes from Pedro and Ines' life. Her tomb is decorated with scenes from the life of Christ, including the Crucifixion and with the Last Judgement.
Chapel of Saint Bernard.
This chapel, located in the South side of the transept, has a sculptural group depicting the "Death of Saint Bernard", one of the best works authored by 17th-century Alcobaça monks. In each side of the chapel are buried Kings Afonso II and Afonso III.
Royal Pantheon.
From the right arm of the transept one reaches the Royal Pantheon, a room built in the end of the 18th century in neo-gothic style, being the earliest neo-gothic architectonic experience in Portugal.
The Royal Pantheon has the 13th century tombs of the Queens of Portugal, Urraca of Castile and Beatrix of Castile, married respectively to Kings Afonso II and Afonso III. Besides, there are smaller tombs of unidentified princes. The most remarkable tomb is that of Queen Urraca (died in 1220), buried in a richly-decorated late romanesque tomb. A relief showing the Queen is seen over the tomb, and the sides are decorated with the Apostles under round arched gallery. Other reliefs show the King, surrounded by their children, mourning the late Queen, as well as Christ surrounded by a mandorla and the symbols of the Four Evangelists. Other tombs are richly decorated with arabesques of mudéjar-romanesque style, as well as the Apostles.
Sacristy.
From the ambulatory the sacristy of the church can be reached. The sacristy had been built in manueline style in the early 16-th century, but had to be rebuilt after the 1755 quake. The corridor leading to the sacristy, covered by a splendid manueline rib vaulting, and the portal to the sacristy have survived the quake. The portal is a framed by intertwined vegetal branches that carry the coat-of-arms of Portugal.
Room of the Kings.
This room, located close to the entrance of the church, has a series of 17th-18th century statues representing the Kings of Portugal. The walls are decorated with blue-white 18th century tiles that tell the history of the Monastery of Alcobaça, since its foundation by Afonso Henriques.
Dormitory.
The dormitory is a big gothic room where the monks slept together: only the abbot was allowed to have his own room. In the 16th century the space was divided into individual cells. In the 1930s the cell walls were demolished.
Refectory.
The refectory was the room in which the monks had their meals everyday. While they ate, one of the monks read aloud passages of the Bible from a pulpit, which in Alcobaça is embedded on one of the walls. The access to the pulpit is done through an arched gallery with a staircase. The pulpit is one of the most harmonious architectural structures of the monastery. Like the dormitory, the refectory has many pillars separating aisles and is covered by early gothic rib vaulting.
Cloister of Silence.
The cloister of the monastery was built during the reign of, and sponsored by, King Dinis I. It is one of the largest mediaeval Cistercian cloisters in Europe. Its columns are decorated by capitals with animal and vegetal motifs. The builder was the Portuguese architect Domingo Domingues. The Gothic Fountain Hall has an elegant early renaissance water basin inside, decorated with renaissance motifs including the coat-of-arms of the monastery and reliefs of gryphs. The second floor of the cloister, in manueline style as revealed by its typical twisted columns, was built in the early 16th century.
Chapter House.
This room, where the monks gathered to discuss the daily matters concerning the monastery, was the most important room after the church. Their daily gathering began by listening to the reading of a chapter from the Rule of St Benedict. The entrance to the house is done through a romanesque-looking portal with two similar windows on each side. The room is now filled with baroque statues created by the monks for the main chapel of the church.
Kitchen.
The kitchen of the monastery was built and covered with tiles in the mid-18th century. The central chimney is enormous, supported by eight iron columns. Water and fresh fish were diverted from the river Alcoa to the kitchen basin through a specially-built canal.

Nuštar

Nuštar is a village in eastern Croatia, located northeast of Vinkovci and west of Vukovar, on the route D55. The population of Nuštar is 3,639, with a total of 5,772 people in the municipality, which also includes the nearby villages of Cerić and Marinci (census 2011).
90.79% declare themselves Croats (census 2001).
History.
The name Nuštar comes from "monasterium", because a Benedictine monastery of the Holy Spirit existed there in 1263. The nobleman Nikola Berzeta acquired the estate in the 14th century, and in the 15th century it was owned by the Gorjanski family. A castle that was owned by the Khuen-Belassy family was expanded and had a church built within it in the 18th century. This church was renovated during the 19th century and the castle is now surrounded by a park.
Nuštar suffered major damage during the Croatian War of Independence, when it was surrounded by the rebel Serb forces and often shelled. When Vukovar fell in the Battle of Vukovar, Nuštar was the main extraction point for survivors and the village itself became surrounded from three directions. The parish church of the Holy Spirit suffered extensive damage in the war, which has since been repaired.

He &amp; She

He & She is an American sitcom that aired on the CBS television network as part of its 1967–1968 lineup, originally sponsored by General Foods and Lever Brothers.
"He & She" is widely considered by broadcast historians to have been ahead of its time. Its sophisticated approach to comedy was viewed as opening doors to the groundbreaking MTM family of sitcoms of the 1970s, beginning with "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" in 1970. The character of Oscar was openly the pattern for the Ted Baxter character, for which creator Leonard Stern granted permission.
CBS aired reruns of "He & She" in prime time from June 1970 to September 1970.
Synopsis.
"He & She" stars real-life married couple Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss as Dick and Paula Hollister, a successful cartoonist and his wife, a social worker. Hollister's cartoon "Jetman" had in fact been so successful that it was now a network television series starring egomaniacal actor Oscar North (Jack Cassidy) as Jetman. North constantly argues with Hollister over the interpretation and direction of the Jetman character. Folksinger-actor Hamilton Camp played the role of handyman Andrew Hummel at the apartment building where the starring characters lived, and Kenneth Mars played firefighter Harry Zarakartos, who would often drop in on the Hollisters' apartment by a plank connected to the firehouse across the street.
Writers Chris Hayward and Allan Burns, who created the series "The Munsters", were hired by executive producer Leonard Stern (co-writer and producer of "Get Smart") as story editors for "He & She", for which they won the 1968 Emmy Award for comedy writing. The show received four other Emmy nominations that year, including nominations for Prentiss, Benjamin, and Cassidy. Burns would go on to be a writer and co-creator (among others) of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", of which "He & She" is considered a major forerunner. The show also earned three of the four Writers Guild nominations for Best Writing in a Comedy.
Despite the strong lead-in of "Green Acres" (a top-25 prime-time show that season), "He & She" was cancelled after one season, although selected episodes were later rerun as a summer replacement series by CBS in 1970. USA reran episodes and later in 1998 TV Land ran selected episodes of the series, but it has not been seen since then. Cast members, such as Richard Benjamin, felt that the "Green Acres" lead-in actually hurt the show because the two series were so different in their rural and urban approaches.
The series was also a pioneer in the portrayal of the working wife, which was not yet in vogue on television.

Wurt Pit and Devil's Punchbowl

Wurt Pit and Devil's Punchbowl () is a 0.2 hectare (0.5 acre) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest between East Harptree and the Priddy Circles in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, notified in 1987.
This site consists of the two largest subsidence depressions in the Mendips, formed by the underlying limestones having been dissolved by subterranean waters causing the surface rocks to collapse into the void. Clear evidence of their being collapsed structures rather than erosional or solutional features, is gained from the fact that the surface rocks at both localities are insoluble, being marls at Devil's Punchbowl and a series of limestones and clays which have been impregnated by silica at Wurt Pit. The silica-enrichment of the limestones and clays at Wurt Pit (known as the "Harptree Beds", of early Jurassic age) is also of considerable mineralogical importance since it took place as part of the main phase of mineralisation which emplaced the principal Mendip orefields during Jurassic times. The Harptree Beds show varying degrees of silica-enrichment, and also contain traces of other minerals, such as limonite and yellow ochre (hydrous ferric oxides), barite (barium sulphate), sphalerite (zinc sulphide) and galena (lead sulphide).
Wade and Wade, in their 1929 book "Somerset", described the Devil's Punch Bowl as one of the most notable Swallet Holes on the Mendips

Praise Chapel Christian Fellowship

The Praise Chapel Christian Fellowship is a group of Nondenominational Christian churches centered in Los Angeles, California, United States of America. Praise Chapel is an international family of churches and ministries. It has over 200 churches in the United States and 700 globally.
History.
In May 1975, pastor Michael Neville and his family came from Oklahoma to southeast Los Angeles to become pastor of a small church in Maywood, California, the then Rosewood Assembly. Maywood had changed from a middle-class white area to a predominantly Hispanic community, and it was Neville's conviction that the church should reflect its neighborhood. Members who were not comfortable with change left, but the church soon took on a much more multicultural profile, recruiting even among young gang members. The church grew through people getting saved, many felt called to preach the Gospel. Since they came from gangs and street life, denominations would not open doors for them to preach. Mike then began to send men out to pioneer churches. The movement spread when in 1980 the first church was established in Ontario, California. Since that time, over 200 churches have been planted across the United States and thousands more worldwide.
After Michael Neville.
Michael Neville died in January 1996 at 49 years of age.Thousands of lives have been greatly influenced by Pastor Neville’s leadership. He often embraced those who had never experienced genuine acceptance and convinced them that they could do anything. Those great qualities gave those around him the confidence to "go for it". His widow Donna Neville became the pastor of the church now located in Huntington Park, California. http://www.praisechapelhp.org/
Larry Neville became the senior leader of the movement. Larry pioneered churches in the US, the Philippines and Singapore before returning to pastor in Rancho Cucamonga, California in 1993. Under his leadership the movement has grown around the world. The Fellowship of Churches has multiplied into a network of over 18 Fellowships in the USA and many more Internationally. Larry has written a number on Church Planting and how to structure a Global Movement.
International work.
Praise Chapel goes to other nations in the world through their mission, Praise Chapel Missions. Praise Chapel is on a mission to send their people to other nations to harvest souls for Jesus Christ. Praise Chapel is a church planting movement, with churches in Ghana, Africa, Kenya, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kurdistan, Spain, England, France, Estonia, Holland, The Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, and many more nations. London. Praise Chapel is also the first church to establish a location in Iraq. Pastor Jack Harris is the pastor of this church. Praise Chapel has many other churches in Estonia, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, the Philippines, American Samoa, Israel, Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, and many more churches in South America.
Vision.
Praise Chapel's vision is summarized as "Evangelize the Lost, Disciple the Believers and Multiply through Church Planting" or more briefly "Win-Build-Send."
Conferences.
For years Praise Chapel held a World Bible Conference every year and then every two years. After the 2010 Globality Bible Bible Conference the Fellowship multiplied into 18 Fellowships called a Family of Fellowships. In 2009, PCCF President Larry Neville announced the theme of the 2010 World Conference: ""Globality: The Gospel to Everyone, By Anyone, From Anywhere." It was also announced that 2010 marks the last central World Conference for PCCF due to growth in the fellowship. Praise Chapel also holds further Bible Conferences in other parts of the United States and other countries. Yearly, Praise Chapel holds Youth Conferences, Men's Conferences, Women's' Conferences, Pastor's Retreats, and Marriage Retreats. Most of these conferences are held in Palm Springs, California.

Thomas Clement Fletcher

Thomas Clement Fletcher (January 21, 1827March 25, 1899) was the 18th Governor of Missouri during the latter stages of the American Civil War and the early part of Reconstruction. He was the first Missouri governor to be born in the state.
Early life and career.
Fletcher was born in Herculaneum, Missouri. His parents had immigrated to Missouri from Maryland in 1818. He received a public school education and was elected circuit clerk in Jefferson County, Missouri, from 1849 until 1856. He was admitted to the bar in 1857.
Fletcher became a land agent for the southwest branch of the Pacific Railroad (which later became the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway) whereupon he moved to St. Louis. Although he had been raised as a Democrat in a slave-owning family, he had been an ardent abolitionist since his boyhood and became a Republican after 1856.
Civil War.
Fletcher was a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago, where he supported the nomination of Abraham Lincoln. During the Civil War, he was Colonel of the 31st Missouri Volunteer Infantry in the Union army from 1862 until 1864, when he became Colonel of the 47th Missouri Volunteer Infantry. In 1862 he was captured at the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou and taken to Libby Prison, and then exchanged in May 1863. He was present at the fall of Vicksburg and the Battle of Chattanooga, and commanded a brigade in the Atlanta Campaign.
Returning home because of illness in the spring of 1864, Fletcher recovered in time to organize the 47th and 50th Missouri infantry regiments and to command a regiment at the Battle of Pilot Knob, Missouri, where General Sterling Price's advance on St. Louis was stalled. For this service, he was brevetted brigadier general of volunteers.
Political career.
Fletcher was nominated for governor of Missouri by the National Union Party and elected in 1864. He served from 1865 to 1869, and issued the proclamation abolishing slavery in the state. His administration was confronted with many problems, including amnesty for former Confederate soldiers, the disposition of the railroad property the state had acquired through default by the railroad companies failure to pay interest on bonds guaranteed by the state, and the reorganization of public education. The railroad property was sold under a guarantee of early completion and the state debt materially reduced. The public-school system was thoroughly reorganized and progress was made toward free education for all children.
He was unsuccessful, however, in his repeated efforts to obtain a constitutional amendment abolishing the test oath as a qualification for voting and for engaging in the professions. He supported normal schools for training teachers, greater funding for the state university, and special attention to agricultural education.
After serving as governor, Fletcher returned to St. Louis and practiced law for a time. He then moved to Washington, D.C., where he continued to practice until his death. He wrote "Life and Reminiscences of General Wm. T. Sherman" (1891).
He was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.
Fletcher, Missouri, is named after him, as was the U.S. Army's Fort Fletcher in Kansas.
