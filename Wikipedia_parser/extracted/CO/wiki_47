Professional Contractors Group

PCG is a British not for profit organisation. It was established in 1999 as The Professional Contractors Group, a protest group against the IR35 tax statute. Later, it expanded its responsibilities to cover wider interests of freelance consultants and contractors as full representative body for freelancing in the UK, in the form of a company limited by guarantee. It is a not-for-profit organisation owned and run by its members. Anyone may join, and while often members run their own limited companies, sole traders and contractors operating via partnerships or umbrella companies are also well represented within the membership. It represents members in numerous sectors, including IT, engineering, interim management, media, project management, healthcare, oil and gas extraction and marketing.
Member services.
PCG offers its members a range of services as part of its membership package. These include:
In addition, PCG runs a number of schemes for the benefit of its members, including:

Edward Hudson (dentist)

Edward Hudson (1743 – 4 October 1821) was born in Castlemartyr, County Cork, Ireland.
Hudson was an eminent dentist, at a time when dentistry was still very much a fledgling practice. Edward created a "Preservative and other Dentifrices" for the bettering of dental hygiene during his time as a Dentist.
Edward Hudson lived and practiced in Grafton Street, Dublin, and latterly lived at The Hermitage in Rathfarnham, Dublin (known in Edward's time as Fields of Odin, and subsequently as St. Enda's). This grand building on the outskirts of Dublin is now the home of the Pearse Museum, which celebrates the life of Patrick Pearse.
During his time at "The Hermitage", Hudson built several ruins along the edge of the grounds, which remain to this day. The ruins were deliberately built as such from new, using rough stone to create the impression that they had existed for many years. These include a small Watchtower (fortification), a hermit’s cave, a dolmen and a ruined abbey.
Amongst other vocations, Hudson was a Director of the Grand Canal of Ireland, a scientific experimenter and philosophiser, and a publisher of several anonymous scientific and political treatises.
Hudson was the uncle of Robert Blake, the first State Dentist of Ireland, who was inspired to become a Dentist by his uncle. Edward's son Henry Philerin Hudson subsequently succeeded Dr Blake as State Dentist.
In addition to his residences in Dublin, Hudson also owned "The Manor" in Glenville, County Cork, which he purchased sometime between 1776 and 1788. Edward Hudson is buried in Glenville Churchyard, along with other members of the Hudson family including his son William Elliott Hudson, the composer, collector of ancient Irish music and an Irish patriot.
It was Hudson's wish that when buried, his grave in the small churchyard at Glenville would be covered by:
Sadly, such a cone was never built, and the £500 left for this purpose must have gone to an alternative use.

Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon

Abraham ben Moses ben Maimon (אברהם בן רמב"ם; also known as Rabbeinu Avraham ben ha-Rambam, and Avraham Maimuni) (1186 – December 7, 1237) was the son of Maimonides who succeeded his father as Nagid of the Egyptian Jewish community.
Biography.
Avraham was born in Fostat, Egypt - his father, Maimonides, was fifty-one years old then. The boy was "modest, highly refined and unusually good natured"; he was also noted for his brilliant intellect and even while a youth became known as a great scholar. When his father died in 1204 at the age of sixty-nine, and Avraham was only nineteen, Avraham was recognised as the greatest scholar in his community. Thus, he succeeded "Rambam" as "Nagid" (head of the Egyptian Jews), as well as in the office of court physician, at the age of only eighteen. (The office of "nagid" was held by the Maimonides family for four successive generations until the end of the 14th century). Rabbi Avraham greatly honored the memory of his father, and defended his writings and works against all critics. Thanks to his influence, a large Egyptian Karaite community returned to the fold of Rabbinic Judaism.
Works.
Avraham Maimuni's best known work is his "Milhamoth ha-Shem" ("The Book of the Wars for God"), in which he answers the critics of his father's philosophical doctrines expressed in the "Guide for the Perplexed". He had initially avoided entering the controversy over his father's writings, however, when he heard of the alleged burning of his father's books in Montpellier in 1235, he compiled "Milchamot HaShem" which he addressed to the Hachmei Provence. His principal work is originally composed in Judeo-Arabic and entitled "כתאב כפיא אלעאבדין" "Kitāb Kifāyah al-`Ābidīn" ("A Comprehensive Guide for the Servants of God"). From the extant surviving portion it is conjectured that Maimuni's treatise was three times as long as his father's "Guide for the Perplexed". In the book, Maimuni evinces a great appreciation of and affinity for Sufism (Islamic mysticism). Followers of his path continued to foster a Jewish-Sufi form of pietism for at least a century, and he is righlty considered the founder of this pietistic school.
His other works include a commentary on the Torah in of which only his commentaries on "Genesis" and "Exodus" are now extant, as well as commentaries on parts of his father's "Mishneh Torah" and on various tractates of the Talmud. He also wrote a work on "Halakha" (Jewish law), combined with philosophy and ethics (also in Arabic, and arranged after his father's "Mishne Torah"). His "Discourse on the Sayings of the Rabbis" - discussing "aggadah" - is often quoted.
He also authored various medical works.

Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency

"Not to be confused with the smaller ward that existed since pre-independence era named as Jalan Besar Single Member Constituency, which is also where the ex-minister Lee Boon Yang made his debut."
Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency (Traditional Chinese: 惹蘭勿剎集選區;Simplified Chinese: 惹兰勿刹集选区) is a now defunct five-member Group Representation Constituency, and therefore an electoral district composed of several city suburbs surrounding the Central Area of Singapore, of which the street Jalan Besar it is named after and forms its centrepiece. The street itself is within the Kallang planning area, Kallang itself being part of the Jalan Basar Group Representation Constituency. The GRC has five divisions, namely Jalan Besar, Kampong Glam, Kolam Ayer, Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng and Whampoa.
Several elective areas such as Little India, colourful Desker Road, Kolam Ayer and Crawford, these of which border the Kallang River is located in the GRC. Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng itself includes the Singapore River and Chinatown whose Member of Parliament is Lily Neo. Whampoa which covers Balestier Road and Whampoa whose MP is Heng Chee How. These areas are relatively older compared to many of the newer suburbs of Singapore.
Jalan Besar GRC has been headed by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Yaacob Ibrahim since Dr Lee Boon Yang retired from the Cabinet on 1 April 2009.
Jalan Besar GRC is a favourite GRC to be contested by the opposition at every election, with the exception in 1991 GE.

<doc id="2882424" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882424" title="IR35">
IR35

IR35 is the United Kingdom tax legislation designed to tax "disguised employment" at a rate similar to employment. In this context, "disguised employees" means workers who receive payments from a client via an intermediary and whose relationship with their client is such that had they been paid directly they would be employees of the client.
Before IR35 was introduced workers who owned their own companies were allowed to receive payments from clients direct to the company and to use the company revenue as would any small company. Company profits could be distributed as dividends, which are not subject to National Insurance payments. Workers could also save tax by splitting ownership of the company with family members in order to place income in lower tax bands. (This latter practice was recommended by government publications advising on setting up family businesses, but attacked as tax fraud by other government departments, notably the Treasury. It came under separate, ultimately unsuccessful attack in 2007, see S660A.)
On 20 May 2010 the new Liberal Democrat/Conservative coalition Government's Programme for Government announced a commitment to ""review IR 35, as part of a wholesale review of all small business taxation, and seek to replace it with simpler measures that prevent tax avoidance but do not place undue administrative burdens or uncertainty on the self-employed, or restrict labour market flexibility."" On 10 Mar 2011 the Office of Tax Simplification recommended that the treasury should suspend IR35 or compel HM Revenue & Customs to make changes to its implementation until wider structural reform to integrate Income Tax and NIC is introduced. After that, the Chancellor announced the Government would keep IR35 'as is' during Budget 2011, but with changes to HMRC administration and to create a new IR35 Forum.
Background and contents.
In 1999, as part of that year’s Budget, the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, announced that measures would be introduced to counter tax avoidance by the use of so-called personal service companies. Properly known as the “intermediaries legislation”, it is more commonly referred to by the consecutively numbered Inland Revenue (now HMRC) budget press release number 35 in which it was announced (i.e. the 35th press release of that year), titled "IR35: Countering Avoidance in the Provision of Personal Services". The press release was issued on 9 March 1999, the same day as the Chancellor of the Exchequer's budget statement.
It came into force throughout the UK in April 2000. Although it was part of that year's Finance Act and was not law at the start of the Financial Year, the Act backdated its commencement to April 6, 2000. The legislation has been consolidated in the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and in the Statutory Instrument Social Security Contributions (Intermediaries) Regulations 2000, SI 2000/727.
Historically, it had been advantageous for the owners of a small company to take all of their wages in one month, thereby only incurring NI contributions once (up to the monthly ceiling) instead of paying a regular contribution every month like most employees. This ploy had been circumvented some years prior to the introduction of IR35 by imposing NI on the "total" annual income of directors as if it were spread over the year, even if only paid by one payment. The increased usage of dividend payments instead of wages was partly a reaction to this change. An additional sense of grievance felt by those who were driven to incorporate, for whatever reason, was the large disparity between the National Insurance burden on companies and employees (>20% if the employer's contribution is included) and that imposed on the self-employed.
The stated aim of the measure was to prevent workers from setting up limited companies via which they would work effectively as employees, but saving on tax. The so-called “Friday to Monday” scenario, that it was possible for a worker to leave a job on Friday and return on Monday to be doing the same work for the same company, but, as a contractor via their own limited company paying a lot less tax, was cited in the press release as the anomaly being corrected. In such a scenario, HM Revenue and Customs would be allowed to “look through” the contractual arrangement between the worker’s company and the client company and to formulate a “hypothetical contract” which showed that the worker was a “disguised employee”. The fee paid to the worker’s company would then be taxed as a salary. Normal employment status rules should be applied when considering IR35 status and the view of HM Revenue and Customs can be successfully challenged.
Support.
The main arguments adduced in favour of IR35 are:
Criticism.
IR35 has been strongly criticised by several bodies, including the Professional Contractors Group a professional association supporting freelancers, contractors and consultants, by former Ernst & Young tax partner Anne Redston, and by other accountancy bodies, employment agencies, and taxation experts. Some of the key criticisms levelled at the measure include:
Effectiveness.
It is hard to judge the effectiveness of the legislation, since as of 2010 the UK Inland Revenue have not published any figures. On 6 Jan 2004 Dawn Primarolo was asked in Parliament how many investigations under the IR35 regulation have (a) been initiated, (b) resulted in additional revenue and (c) been concluded without securing additional revenue. In a written answer she replied that it was not possible with any accuracy to isolate data relating solely to this legislation.
On 15 June 2009 in the House of Commons Labour MP Terry Rooney (Bradford North) asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer "how many investigations concerning IR35 were launched in each of the last five years; and how many of them resulted in (a) prosecution, (b) an increase in tax due and (c) no further action". Kitty Ussher speaking for the Chancellor replied, "The intermediaries legislation, commonly known as "IR35", was introduced with effect from 6 April 2000 to counter the avoidance of employed levels of tax and national insurance by individuals providing their services through intermediaries. Disclosure of HM Revenue and Customs' compliance data relating to the legislation would result in a risk of non-compliance with the legislation. Accordingly I am not able to provide the data requested." The July 2009 issue of "IT Now", the British Computer Society magazine, reported that between April 2002 and March 2008 the Government had raised £9.2 million under IR35 legislation compared to the £220 million that it was initially expected.
The Professional Contractors Group (PCG) claims 1462 wins to 6 losses in appeals for IR35 and S660A together, however this only applies to its own members and may not be typical of the wider picture.
Revenue raised.
The initial regulatory impact assessment for IR35 in 1999 stated that HMRC expected the measure to generate £220 million per year in National Insurance contributions, and a further £80 million in income tax.
On 6 Jan 2004 Dawn Primarolo was asked by the Shadow Paymaster General Mark Prisk MP about additional revenue secured from investigations under IR35. She replied that "Establishing whether or not the intermediaries legislation applies is undertaken as part of the Inland Revenue's Employer Compliance Review programme. As such it is not possible with any accuracy to isolate data relating solely to this legislation." She gave a similar answer when asked about administration and employment costs.
In May 2009 the Professional Contractors Group received a reply to a request under the Freedom of Information Act to HMRC, asking just how much tax revenue IR35 had in fact raised for the exchequer. The FOI reply revealed that in the tax years 2002/03 to 2007/08, IR35 directly raised just £9.2 million. This equates to an average of around only £1.5 million per tax year, less than 1% of the expected amount. It is not clear whether this includes the NI contribution, or is just income tax.
In September 2011 a Freedom of Information Request revealed that the number of cases reviewed had fallen from 158 (year ending April 2007) to 12 in year ending April 2010 and 23 in year ending April 2011. The same document also gives the "tax yield received for the requested years" as having fallen from £1,906,619 to £219,180. No details are given for the costs of the investigations or the costs of collecting the tax. It is not clear whether this figure relates to the revenue raised from investigations, or the total revenue from IR35. No figures were given for the cost of administrating the tax, or the cost of the investigations.

S660A

In its United Kingdom Tax Bulletin 64 (April 2003), the Inland Revenue (now HM Revenue and Customs) announced new guidance on the "settlements legislation". This is a body of law which seeks to prevent someone (known as the "settlor") from avoiding tax by reclassifying income as belonging to someone else (known as the beneficiary). The income is then taxed at the beneficiary’s lower rate although the settlor continues to benefit from it. The legislation targets spouses and also parents seeking to divert income via their minor children.
The section of the legislation is 660A of the UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Using the revised (April 2003) interpretation of s.660A, UK HMRC have been targeting businesses set up by spouses where they are aware that income is split between the spouses, and only one of them directly generates that income. In theory s.660A can apply to partnerships as well as limited companies, this has yet to be tested in the UK courts. In 2007 the interpretation was finally rejected by the Law Lords, resulting in the government proposing new leglisation to tackle the perceived abuse.
In the December 2008 pre-budget report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was deferring the introduction of the legislation, and giving no date for its introduction.

<doc id="2882447" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882447" title="Elorrio">
Elorrio

Elorrio, colloquially Elorrixo is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country, Spain. Elorrio is part of the "comarca" of Durangaldea and has a population of 7.117 inhabitants as of 2007 according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
Toponymy.
In the Basque language, "elorrio" is the word for the red fruit (haw) of the common hawthorn. The Basque word "elorri" means "hawthorn". The coat of arms of the town shows a hawthorn. Colloquially, the town was called "Elorrixo" in Basque.
History.
The Argiñeta tombs that today lie just outside the town of Elorrio are both pre-Christian and Christian (the earliest date of the latter is recorded as 893). In 1053, the San Agustín de Etxebarria monastery was founded, which in time was renovated and eventually became present-day church (an example of Gothic architecture). In 1356, Don Tello, Lord of Biscay, officially created Elorrio (through a foundational charter) on the land where the monastery stood, as a means of creating a town to defend his borders against invasion from neighboring Gipuzkoa. In 1468 the town was the site of a major battle between warring clan factions in the Basque Country (the Oñacinos and the Gamboinos). However, incidents of this type decreased, and between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries, the town's fortunes grew, gaining renown for its iron-forges, and especially the production of lances. 
As a result of this economic expansion, a number of important buildings were constructed (mostly during the sixteenth century) that are today considered monuments of significant historical and architectural importance. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Elorrio, although it remained a predominantly rural town, became a tourist destination, as people visited the locality to attend one of its two well-known spas. After the Spanish Civil War, Elorrio went through a period of industrialization, with a number of small, family firms and worker cooperative enterprises emerging. In 1964, the whole town was the first one in Biscay to be declared a Centre of Historical and Artistic Importance. Its population, which grew from 3,500 in 1950 to 8,000 in 1981, currently (2004 records) numbers just over 7,000 people.
Geography.
Elorrio is located at the easternmost point of Biscay, in the "comarca" of Durangaldea, northern Spain. It limits at north with Berriz and Zaldibar at northwest with Abadiño, at west with Atxondo, at east with the province of Gipuzkoa and at south with the province of Álava.
The town is surrounded by various mountains, such as Intxorta (797m) and Udalatx (1092m), and is traversed by the Zumelegi river that, after joining the River Arrazola in Atxondo, goes on to form the Ibaizabal river. 
The town is situated 39 km from the provincial capital of Bilbao.
Demographics.
The National Institute of Statistics estimates that the population of Elorrio was 7,294 in January 1, 2013.
Economy.
The economy of the municipality is based on the industrial activity. Nonetheless, the farming activities still have relevance in the area. Most of the rural exploitations are based on beef and milk production and, in less numbers, the exploitation of pines.
The most important economical activity in the area is the industry; Elorrio is home for several industries of metal processing.
Transport.
The only mean of transport is by road; the BI-634 road crosses the town and connects it with Durango, capital city of the "comarca", and Arrasate-Mondragón in the province of Gipuzkoa. In Durango the road connects with the AP-8 highway to Bilbao and Donostia-San Sebastián while in Arrasate-Mondragón it connects to the AP-1 highway to Eibar and Vitoria-Gasteiz. From Elorrio starts the BI-2632 road to Bergara and Elgeta (both in Gipuzkoa) and the BI-3321 road to Berriz.
Two lines of the Bizkaibus network have stations in Elorrio; the lines A3923 and A3914. Elorrio then has buses to Bilbao every hour and to Durango and other lesser municipalities every 30 minutes.

Leon Knight

Leon Leroy Knight (born 16 September 1982) is an English footballer who plays as a striker; he is currently without a club. A journeyman player, he has played for fifteen different clubs spanning five countries; England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Greece.
Having begun his career with Chelsea, he spent time on loan with Queens Park Rangers, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton & Hove Albion before joining the latter permanently in 2003. Knight spent three years with Brighton, scoring 30 goals in 106 league matches. He was transferred to Swansea City in 2006 and had a loan spell with Barnsley before joining Milton Keynes Dons and then Wycombe Wanderers.
Knight signed for Rushden & Diamonds in 2008, but left the club five months later when he was sacked for misconduct. Rushden retained his registration and would not release it to another English club unless they were compensated, which prevented Knight from playing in England for three years. He subsequently played in Greece for Thrasivoulos Fylis, Scotland for Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South and Northern Ireland for Coleraine, before joining Glentoran in January 2012. He was released by Glentoran in June 2012 after a probationary clause in his contract was invoked by the club.
Club career.
Knight began his career as a trainee at Chelsea (where he made one appearance in the UEFA Cup against Levski Sofia), before spending loan periods at Queens Park Rangers, Huddersfield Town, Sheffield Wednesday and Brighton & Hove Albion before joining Brighton on a permanent contract in August 2003. During his spell at Huddersfield, he reignited the Terriers' play-off push and formed an unlikely partnership with local hero Andy Booth, earning himself the nickname 'Neon Light'. Unfortunately, he was sent off in the penultimate game of the season and was suspended for the play-off games. Although his transfer was initially free, £50,000 was to be paid if Brighton were promoted. It was Knight himself who secured Brighton's promotion with his penalty against Bristol City in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff in 2004. Knight had a falling out with Brighton manager Mark McGhee, which culminated in Knight being thrown off the team bus in the middle of the New Forest en route to a match against Southampton on 2 January 2006.
Knight moved to Swansea City shortly afterwards, and scored a hat-trick on his debut against Milton Keynes Dons. His stay at the Liberty Stadium was short-lived, and he was placed on the transfer list in October 2006, due to a poor attitude. After a short spell on loan with Barnsley, he joined Milton Keynes Dons in January 2007. In January 2008, Knight signed for Wycombe Wanderers, just one year after joining MK Dons. On 19 August 2008, Knight's contract was "terminated by mutual consent", after he scored five goals in 20 appearances during his short stay with Wycombe.
Knight signed for Rushden & Diamonds on a three-year contract on 24 August 2008. but was transfer listed on 29 October, along with Lee Tomlin, Curtis Woodhouse, Andy Burgess, Phil Gulliver, Sagi Burton, Lee Phillips and Dean McDonald, after the club's poor start to the season. On 12 December, Rushden & Diamonds confirmed that Knight had been sacked after continual breaches of conduct between November and December 2008. Despite his contract having been terminated, Rushden & Diamonds retained the players registration, preventing Knight from joining another English club until the term of his contract had expired, unless £30,000 in compensation was paid to the club. The FA confirmed and validated the retaining of the registration, meaning Knight could not play at any level of English football until the contract had expired. The contract had initially been due to expire following the 2009–10 season, but Rushden & Diamonds invoked a clause allowing them to extend the contract by a further year.
On 13 January 2009, Knight joined Greek club Thrasivoulos Filis on a six-month contract. He made his Super League debut on 25 January as a second half sub playing 20 minutes against Skoda Xanthi. Knight made only 2 subsequent appearances as a sub, his last appearance coming on 8 February 2009. Knight had not been involved in any game for the club in over 3 months and looked certain to leave Thrasivoulos when his contract expired at the end of the season. After his contract expired he went on trial with Major League Soccer side San Jose Earthquakes. 
Knight joined Scottish side Hamilton Academical on 21 August 2009, and he made his SPL debut against Aberdeen as a second half substitute the following day. He made one start and six substitute appearances for the Lanarkshire side. He was sent off for his role in a tunnel brawl after a win over Heart of Midlothian, having been an unused substitute during the game. Knight was later released by Hamilton on 14 January 2010. The next day, Knight joined Dumfries club Queen of the South until the end of the season. He made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Dundee on 23 January. He was released at the end of the 2009–10 season, having made six league appearances for the club. In September 2010, Knight was set to return to English football with Conference side Darlington after a successful trial, but his transfer was blocked by previous club Rushden, who had held onto his registration and demanded £30,000 for the deal to be completed. Knight responded by criticising Rushden & Diamonds on his Twitter account, saying that he has chosen not to buy-out his contract as a matter of principle. "Rushden have said they don't want the money from Darlington, they want it from me – I refuse to pay them out of principle. If I wanted I could raise the money and pay them but I don't want to give them the satisfaction."
The following month, Knight elected to continue his career outside of England by signing for Northern Irish side Coleraine. He scored twice on his debut in a 2–1 win away to Glenavon on 16 October 2010. He agreed an 18-month contract extension with the club in January 2011, and finished the 2010–11 season with 14 league goals from 23 matches. In June, he went on trial with Swindon Town, but was released after two days because of insufficient fitness levels. "He's not the player for us. It's not his fault, we tried, but his fitness at the moment is not good," said Swindon manager Paolo Di Canio. "We are not in a position where we can wait for a player to be fit, we need a player to be ready and fit in the next two weeks, to compete and challenge during the season." Two weeks later, Knight was transfer-listed and suspended by Coleraine for failing to appear for training and matches. He also breached club rules by stating his desire to return to England and play for another IFA Premiership club. However, a fortnight later, Knight signed a new two-year contract with the club. "I said things about wanting to leave and at the time I felt it was right for me, but things change," he said. "I've spoken at great length with the manager over the last three or four days and I came back to him wanting to work something out. Agreeing a new two-year deal shows my commitment to the club and that I'm eager to put the last few weeks behind me."
In January 2012 however, Coleraine asked Knight to either live in Northern Ireland or pay his own travel costs, as he was still living in London and had to travel over to Northern Ireland for each game, which was costing Coleraine £1,000–£1,500 per month. An agreement could not be reached, and Knight joined Glentoran on 30 January 2012. His stay at Glentoran was relatively short lived, as the club released him in June 2012 when they invoked a probationary clause in his contract after he allegedly made homophobic comments on Twitter.
International career.
Knight has played for England at under 19 and under 20 level.
Personal life.
Knight was born in Hackney, London, to a Jamaican mother and St. Lucian father, and was educated at Raine's Foundation School, Bethnal Green, 
He has three sisters, and is the cousin of Bolton Wanderers defender Zat Knight. He is the cousin of Grime MC Trim.
Knight was a good all-around sportsman and a third dan black belt in karate as a child. 
He played schoolboy football for his school, the Hackney & Tower Hamlets District team and Senrab, and had trials with Charlton Athletic and Tottenham Hotspur before joining Chelsea as a trainee.
Knight's use of Twitter in May 2012 caused condemnation after he posted remarks opposing US President Barack Obama's support for same sex marriage.
Knight was suspended by Glentoran on 10 May 2012, pending investigation into the aforementioned remarks. This later led to his release by the club in June 2012.
On 12 May 2012, Knight announced on Twitter that he was fundraising for 'Help a London Child' and that he would donate himself every time he scored during the 2012–13 season. The Page is run and updated by Knight and his friend Steve Greenwood, a Nursery Nurse from Hertfordshire and aims to raise £20,000 by May 2013.

Erandio

Erandio is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the autonomous community of Basque Country, northern Spain.
In 1415, during the War of the Bands, the "corregidor", the royally-appointed governor of the Biscayan "hermandad", acting on royal orders, siphoned off Biscayan wheat to the Asturias, inciting a rebellion. The Biscayans were defeated at Erandio with the loss of sixty men and the wheat transfers continued.
Festivals.
Several annual festivals are celebrated in Erandio. Most of them are "fiestas patronales" (patronage festivals, held in the days around the date dedicated to the patron saints under whose advocation churches and hermits are).
The local public holiday of the municipality rotates yearly on August 10, August 28 and the corpus Christi day.
Erandio has also celebrated a street music festival called Musikale, with music bands marching and playing in the neighbourhoods of Altzaga and Astrabudua. Musikale was originally conceived in the neighbouring municipality of Leioa. For some years it was held simultaneously in Leioa, Erandio, Basauri and Sestao, but the other municipalities dropped it, and in 2013 only Erandio organised it.
Transport.
Erandio is connected to other municipalities of Biscay (like Barakaldo, Bermeo, Bilbao, Derio, Getxo, Larrabetzu, Laukiz, Leioa, Mungia and Muskiz) by Bizkaibus bus services and by Line 1 of Metro Bilbao, which has three stations in Erandio (Lutxana, Erandio, and Astrabudua). It is also connected to Barakaldo by regular fluvial transport over the Estuary of Bilbao.

Spinup cycles

Spinup Cycles (also called CSS, "on/off cycles" or "power cycles") is a value that hard disk manufacturers give for the average times a hard drive can spin up before it fails.
Usually server hard disks are specified for less spinup cycles than desktop hard disks, because servers are only very rarely rebooted. On the other hand server hard disks have much higher MTBF.

Rugby ball

A rugby ball is a diamond shape ball usee for easier passing. 
Richard Lindon and Bernardo Solano started making balls for Rugby school out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pigs’ bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig’s bladder, although early balls were more plumb-shape than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig’s bladder was. 
Until 1870, rugby was played with a near spherical ball with an inner-tube made of a pig's bladder. In 1870 Richard Lindon introduced rubber inner-tubes and because of the pliability of rubber the shape gradually changed from a sphere to an egg. In 1892 the RFU endorsed ovalness as the compulsory shape. The gradual flattening of the ball continued over the years.
The introduction of synthetic footballs over the traditional leather balls, in both rugby codes, was originally governed by weather conditions. If the playing surface was wet, the synthetic ball was used, as it didn't absorb water and become heavy. Eventually, the leather balls were phased out completely.
Rugby league.
Rugby league is played with a prolate spheroid shaped football which is inflated with air. A referee will stop play immediately if the ball does not meet the requirements of size and shape. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are synthetic and manufactured in a variety of colours and patterns. Senior competitions should use light coloured balls to allow spectators to see the ball more easily. The football used in rugby league is known as "international size" or "size 5" and is approximately long and in circumference at its widest point. Smaller-sized balls are used for junior versions of the game, such as "Mini" and "Mod". A full size ball weighs between . Rugby league footballs are slightly more pointed than rugby union footballs and larger than American footballs.
The Australasian National Rugby League and European Super League use balls made by Steeden. Steeden is also sometimes used as a noun to describe the ball itself.
Rugby union.
The ball used in rugby union, usually referred to as a rugby ball, is a prolate spheroid essentially elliptical in profile. Traditionally made of brown leather, modern footballs are manufactured in a variety of colors and patterns. A regulation football is long and in circumference at its widest point. It weighs and is inflated to .
In 1980, leather-encased balls, which were prone to water-logging, were replaced with balls encased in synthetic waterproof materials. The Gilbert Synergie was the match ball of the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

<doc id="2882473" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882473" title="Tetrafluoroethylene">
Tetrafluoroethylene

Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) is a chemical compound with the formula C2F4. It is the simplest alkene fluorocarbon. This gaseous species is used primarily in the industrial preparation of polymers.
Properties.
Tetrafluoroethylene is a colorless, odorless gas. Like all unsaturated fluorocarbons it is susceptible to nucleophilic attack. It is unstable towards decomposition to C and and prone to form explosive peroxides in contact with air.
Industrial use.
Polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene produces polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymers such as Teflon and Fluon. PTFE is one of the two fluorocarbon resins composed wholly of fluorine and carbon. The other resin composed purely of carbon and fluorine is the copolymer of TFE with typically 6–9% hexafluoropropene (HFP), which is known as FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer). TFE is also used in the preparation of numerous copolymers that also include hydrogen and/or oxygen, including both fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers. Typical TFE-based fluoroplastics include ETFE, the alternating 1:1 copolymer with ethylene, and PFA, which is a random copolymer similar to FEP but with a minor amount of a perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PAVE) rather than HFP. DuPont uses primarily perfluoro(methylvinylether), whereas Daikin uses primarily perfluoro(propylvinylether) in manufacturing PFA. There are numerous other fluoropolymers that contain TFE, but usually not at greater than 50% by weight.
Manufacture.
TFE is manufactured from chloroform. Chloroform is fluorinated by reaction with hydrogen fluoride to produce chlorodifluoromethane (R-22). Pyrolysis of chlorodifluoromethane then yields TFE, with difluorocarbene as an intermediate.
The reverse reaction – vacuum pyrolysis of PTFE at in a quartz vessel – is a convenient laboratory synthesis of TFE. The PTFE polymer cracks, and at a pressure below exclusively C2F4 is obtained. At higher pressures the product mixture contains hexafluoropropylene and octafluorocyclobutane.
Safety.
TFE is an alkylating agent, albeit a weak one, and as such is expected to be carcinogenic. LD50(rat, inhalation) = 40000 ppm. The compound is best handled diluted with an inert gas, as localized heating can provoke explosive decomposition to C and CF4. When working with TFE, oxygen must be carefully excluded, as it catalyzes autopolymerization, which can take place with great force.
There is also a danger of explosion when working with TFE, from adiabatic compression. If pressurized TFE is allowed into a vessel/pipework at a lower pressure the heat generated from compression may be sufficient to ignite the TFE, causing explosion/explosive decomposition.
In industry, pipework is flushed with pressurized nitrogen, before the introduction of TFE, both to exclude oxygen and to avoid adiabatic compression.

Garuda Purana

Garuda Purana (Devanagari गरुड़ पुराण) is one of the eighteen Puranas which are part of the Hindu body of texts known as smriti. It is a Vaishnava Purana and the epic is in form of conversation between Lord Vishnu and Garuda (King of Birds), primarily emphasizing the reason and meaning of Human Life form. It contains details of life after death, funeral rites and the metaphysics of reincarnation, thus it is recited as a part Antyesti (Antim Sanskar) or funeral rites (funeral liturgy) in Hinduism. The Padma Purana categorizes Garuda Purana as a Sattva Purana (Purana which represents goodness and purity). The epic purana which is considered to be lastly edited by Veda Vyāsa, speaks of different incarnations of Lord Vishnu, geographical description, origin of the Universe, Creation, Procreation, Genealogy of Gods and the journey of a soul after death. Garuda Purana also talks about the origin and propagation of Garuda himself and also describes different kinds of austerities, methods of worship, atonement for sin and divine & sacred Manthras.
Overview.
The Garuda Purana is a Vaishnava Purana and has nineteen thousand shlokas that are divided into two parts, a purva khanda (first part) and an uttara khanda (subsequent part). The others in this group are Vishnu Purana, Narada Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Padma Purana and Varaha Purana.
The Purana which has nineteen thousand shlokas (lines)is classified as a medium-sized Purana. The Skanda Purana, for example, has eighty-one thousand shlokas. And the Markandeya Purana only nine thousand. Each khanda has several chapters (adhyaya).
The purva khanda has two hundred and thirty-four chapters. It is also called Achara Khanda. It deals with astronomy, medicine, grammar and other subjects, such as gems. In this khanda we can find the explanation of Ayurveda(medicine)in detail. The Uttara khanda has only forty-five. The latter half of Garuda Purana deals with life after death. Hindus generally read this Purana while cremating their dead. The Garuda Purana is considered the authoritative Vedic reference describing ancient Indian gemology. Chapters 68-80 give primitive gemological information describing 14 primary gems, viz., Ruby, Natural Pearl, Yellow Sapphire, Hessonite, Emerald, Diamond, Cats eye, Blue Sapphire, Coral, Red Garnet, Jade, colorless Quartz, and Bloodstone. In Chapter 69 on pearls, the speaker, Suta Goswami, describes seven other types of pearls besides Oyster Pearl ("Chandra-moti"), viz., pearl from Conch shell ("Shankh-moti"), Wild Boar’s head ("Varaha-moti"), Elephant’s head ("Gaja-moti"), Cobra’s head ("Naga-moti" or "Nagamani"), Bamboo stems ("Venu-moti"), Fish head ("Matsya-moti"), and from the sky and clouds ("Akash-moti" or "Megh-moti").
Suta and the other sages.
Sūta was a learned sage. He was very well-versed in the Puranas and in the shastras (sacred texts). He was also devoted to Vishnu.
Vedavyasa taught the Puranas to one of his disciples named Romaharshana or Lomaharshana. He was thus named because the hair (roma) on his body was thrilled (harshana), leading to Goose bumps, when he heard the Puranas from his teacher. It was Romaharshana who related the stories of the Puranas to everyone else. The Bhagavata Purana says the Romaharshana had a son named Suta and it was this son who related the story of that particular Purana to the other sages . On the other hand, Romaharshana himself belonged to the suta class, so that he too could be addressed as Sūta. From reading the Garuda Purana, one does get the impression that it is Romaharshana himself who is relating the story, and not his son.
To come back to the point, Romaharshana came to a forest known as Naimisharanya. He sat there and contemplated the mysteries of the Lord Vishnu.
Several other rishis (sages) led by Shounaka also came to the forest. They told Romaharshana, "Sage, you know everything. Who is the god of all gods? Who is to be worshipped? What does one meditate on? Who destroys evil? How did the world come to be created? What is dharma (righteousness)? Tell us all these things and more".
"I will", replied Romaharshana. "I will recite to you the Garuda Purana. Many years ago, this Purana was told to the sage Kashyapa by the great bird Garuda himself. I learnt it from my teacher Vyasadeva. But first let me list for you the twenty-two avataras of Vishnu.
The first incarnation was a young boy. In this form, Vishnu adopted celibacy (brahmacharya) and performed difficult tapasya (meditation).
The second incarnation was as a boar (Varaha). In this form, Vishnu rescued the earth from the underworld.
The third incarnation was as a great sage (devarishi). In this form, Vishnu spread the knowledge of several texts (tantras).
The fourth incarnation was as two sages named Nara-Narayana.
The fifth incarnation was as the great sage Kapila. Kapila taught his disciple Asuri the wonderful philosophy known as Samkhya yoga.
The sixth incarnation was as the sage Dattatreya, the son of Atri and Anasuya.
The seventh incarnation took place in the manvantra known as svayambhuva. Vishnu was born as the son of Ruchi and Akuti and performed many yajnas (sacrifices).
In the eighth incarnation, Vishnu was born as Urukrama, the son of Nabhi and Meru. He taught everyone the righteous way of life.
In the ninth incarnation, Vishnu became the king Prithu and restored foodgrains and herbs to the earth.
The tenth of Vishnu’s incarnations was as a fish (Matsya). He saved Vaivasvata Manu from the flood that enveloped the world.
In the eleventh incarnation, Vishnu adopted the form of a turtle (Kurma). This was to help out the gods (devas) and demons (asuras) in the churning of the ocean (samudra manthana).
The twelfth incarnation was as Dhanvantari, physician of the gods and the originator of medicine.
The thirteenth was as Giant. Revealing his cosmic form to the Rishis of ancients.
In the fourteenth incarnation, Vishnu became Narasimha, a being who was half-man and half-lion, to kil the evil asura Hiranyakashipu.
The fifteenth incarnation witnessed Vishnu’s adoption of the form of dwarf (Vamana). This was to hoodwink the asura King Bali and restore the heaven to gods.
In the sixteenth incarnation, Vishnu became Parashurama, killed all the wicked Kshatriyas in the world twenty-one times.
The seventeenth incarnation was as Vedavyasa, the son of Parashara and Satyavati. Vedavyasa divided and classified the Vedas.
Vishnu’s eighteen incarnation was as the sage Narada.
The Nineteenth incarnation is Parasurama.
The Twentieth incarnation was Rama.
The twenty first incarnation was Krishna.
In the twenty-second incarnation, Vishnu was Bouddha (not to be confused with Buddha), His incarnation occurred between the dvapara Yuga and the Kali Yuga.
The twenty-third incarnation is yet to come. And Vishnu will come to destroy evil in the world and restore righteousness in the form of Kalki".
There have been several other incarnations of Vishnu. But the ones mentioned above are the major ones.

Leon Pryce

Leon Pryce (born 9 October 1981 in Bradford) is an English professional rugby league footballer of Jamaican descent. A Great Britain and England international representative backline player, he previously played for Bradford with whom he had Challenge Cup and Super League Championship success.
Pryce comes from a family of rugby league players; he is the older brother of Bradford player Karl Pryce, his father and uncle both played the sport at a high level. His cousin Steve Pryce has coached in Jamaica and he is also the cousin of Featherstone Rovers player Waine Pryce.
Bradford.
At age 16, Pryce captained the England schools side. Pryce came through the academy ranks at Bradford, after the club signed him from amateur side Queensbury in Bradford. Pryce played for Bradford Bulls on the wing in the 1999 Super League Grand Final which was lost to St Helens RLFC. He made his full debut for England against France in 1999, and has also represented his home county of Yorkshire.
Pryce played for the Bradford Bulls on the wing in their 2001 Super League Grand Final victory against the Wigan Warriors. As Super League VI champions, the Bulls played against 2001 NRL Premiers, the Newcastle Knights in the 2002 World Club Challenge. Pryce was selected for the interchange bench in Bradford's victory. Later that year Pryce played for the Bulls from the interchange bench in their 2002 Super League Grand Final loss against St Helens RFC. 
In 2003 Pryce escaped a custodial sentence for unlawful wounding, after assaulting Brian Carney. He received 120 hours community service. He played for the Bradford Bulls from the interchange bench in their 2003 Super League Grand Final victory against the Wigan Warriors. Having won Super League VIII, Bradford played against 2003 NRL Premiers, the Penrith Panthers in the 2004 World Club Challenge. Pryce played at stand-off half back and scored a try in the Bulls' 22-4 victory. He played for the Bradford Bulls on the wing and scored a try in their 2005 Super League Grand Final victory against Leeds Rhinos, winning the Harry Sunderland Award for a Man of the Match performance.
St Helens.
After Bradford did not renew his contract in 2005, in 2006 Pryce joined St. Helens. One of the key issues in the decision was that he would start at stand off, a position Pryce has long coveted.
Pryce won his first trophy with St Helens in August 2006, defeating Huddersfield in the Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham. St Helens reached the 2006 Super League Grand final to be contested against Hull FC and Pryce played at stand-off half back, scoring a try in Saints' 26-4 victory.
As 2006 Super League champions, St Helens faced 2006 NRL Premiers the Brisbane Broncos in the 2007 World Club Challenge. Pryce played at stand-off half back in the Saints' 18-14 victory.
He went on to win the Challenge Cup again in 2007 when Saints beat Catalans Dragons 30-8 at Wembley Stadium. He was a joint winner of the Lance Todd Trophy along with Paul Wellens.
In July 2007, Pryce was accused of squeezing Sam Burgess's testicles. He was later found guilty of the incident and banned for three matches. That year he was voted rugby league's dirtiest player by "RL Weekly" readers. He was again found guilty of a similar misconduct, against Bradford forward Andy Lynch on 22 February 2008. However, he escaped a possible eight-match ban as the disciplinary panel ruled the contact "minimal". 
His success at the club continued as he helped Saints to a 26-18 win over Hull in the 2008 Challenge Cup Final.
He was named in the England squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.
He was named in the Super League Dream Team for the 2008's Super League XIII season. He played in 2008's Super League XIII Grand Final defeat by Leeds. Pryce went with the England squad to compete in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup tournament in Australia. In Group A's first match against Papua New Guinea he played at stand-off half back in England's victory.
In 2008 Pryce was charged along with Stuart Reardon and appeared in court on charges of assault and violence following an alleged incident at Reardon's estranged wife's house in Queensbury, Bradford. They were charged with using violence to gain entry and common assault. The charge of using violence to gain entry against both defendants was dropped after the prosecution offered no evidence. In March 2009, having been found guilty of common assault, the pair were given a 12-week suspended sentence.
He also played in the 2009 Super League Grand Final defeat by Leeds.
Catalans Dragons.
Pryce will play for the Perpignan based Catalans Dragons in the 2012 season.

Etxebarri, Doneztebeko Elizatea () is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Autonomous Basque Community, in the North of Spain.
Since 13 January 2005, the name of "Etxebarri, Doneztebeko Elizatea" has been changed officially to "Etxebarri" to simplify the name. It translates as "new home/house" ("etxe" "home", "barri" "new"). Prior to the introduction of Standard Basque, the town's name was spelled "Echevarri".
Etxebarri has an area of 33.38 square kilometres and a population of 10,337 habitants (2012), with a density of 2421.72 inhabitants/km2.
Being so close to Bilbao (1.5 kilometres), this has had a direct effect on Etxebarri. Until a few decades ago, Etxebarri was a small nucleus in which its rural population worked in industrial areas. Both the population and the industrial land increased considerably because of the congestion of Bilbao and the need for space for the installation of industries. Therefore, there is a significant increase in new population that is installed in the locality. In addition, since 2004, the underground of Bilbao arrives at Etxebarri. In fact, the threshold stipulated for the town in 2012 is about 10,000 inhabitants. It has a metro station of the rapid transit service Metro Bilbao and a train station of the commuter rail service EuskoTren.

Arcanacon is a role-playing convention held in Melbourne annually. It is one of several Role-playing conventions of Victoria, Australia run through the year.
Arcanacon is the longest running role-playing convention in Victoria. 
In 1983 the convention was held at Melbourne University. As well as a Dungeons and Dragons major, it also included the second ever freeform to be run in Australia, as well as Traveller, DragonQuest, RuneQuest and Call of Cthulhu tournaments.
1984 saw the convention at University High School and the major appearance of Syd the Arcanasaur, the convention's mascot. In 1985 the convention moved to Melbourne College of Advanced Education. In 1988 it moved to Collingwood Education Centre, where it has remained until now.
Initially the convention was held in September, but it later moved to August and then to July, where it was run during the Victorian School holiday period. In 2001, the convention moved to the Australia Day Weekend (the weekend closest to 26 January). The move was in part due to a perceived change in the focus of CanCon (which is run in Canberra on the same weekend) from mixed roleplaying and wargaming to solely wargaming.
Although sections of the convention had been run with various theme over the years, at Arcanacon XII the convention itself started running an overall theme. In 2000 this theme became a part of the events run at the convention, and games in the theme were sought out to give each year a different feel.
In 2007, a short documentary about roleplaying was filmed at Arcanacan XXI for the Channel 31 television programme "Planet Nerd".

Octafluorocyclobutane

Octafluorocyclobutane, or perfluorocyclobutane, C4F8, is an organofluorine compound which enjoys several niche applications. It is related to cyclobutane by replacement of all C–H bonds with C–F bonds. Octafluorocyclobutane is produced by the dimerization of tetrafluoroethylene and the reductive coupling of 1,2-dichloro-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane.
Applications.
In the production of semiconductor materials and devices, octafluorocyclobutane serves as a deposition gas and etchant. It has also been investigated as a refrigerant in specialised applications, as a replacement for ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants. Exploiting its volatility and chemical inertness, octafluorocyclobutane may be found in some aerosolized foods. It is listed by the Codex Alimentarius under number 946 (E946 for EU). It is investigated as a possible replacement for sulfur hexafluoride as a dielectric gas.
Appendix.
Its critical point is at 115.3 °C and 2.79 MPa.

Towns and villages under the administration of Bretten include Bauerbach, Büchig, Diedelsheim, Dürrenbüchig, Gölshausen, Neibsheim, Rinklingen, Ruit and Sprantal.
History.
Bretten was first mentioned as "villa breteheim" in the "Lorsch codex" in 767. Since 1148 Bretten had the right to mint and issue coins. In 1254 Bretten received city rights. In 1492 Bretten was granted to hold four fairs by Pfalzgraf Philipp. Philipp Melanchthon was born in Bretten in 1497. The residents of Bretten successfully sallied against the Swabian besiegers around Ulrich of Württemberg in 1504. In 1803 Bretten became “Badische Amtsstadt”. After the industrial revolution, the local economy was dominated by cooker production for many years. In 1975 Bretten was given the status of a "Große Kreisstadt" (district city).
Transport.
Bretten station is on the Württemberg Western Railway and the Kraichgau Railway. Every two hours there are direct train connections to Stuttgart and Heidelberg. Many commuters live in Bretten and use S4 services of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, which runs three times an hour to Karlsruhe and back. In Bretten there are 5 Stadtbahn stations and five more stations in the villages that belong to the district of Bretten. The motorways A5, A6 and A8 are reachable within approximately 30 minutes.
Peter and Paul Festival.
The largest event in Bretten is the annual Peter and Paul Festival, which usually attracts up to 80,000 visitors. It is held one long weekend in summer. The main attractions are the numerous performances in countless camps and in the mediaeval lanes in the old town of Bretten. On Sunday, a huge procession of dressed up citizens and guest groups takes place.
Visitors may be irritated or amused by the mixture of costumes which are related to different centuries. You can see mediaeval men-at-arms, shepherds, musicians, jugglers as well as Biedermeier styled families and militias. But the festival has three different sources. The oldest is the successful sally of citizens and men-at-arms on June 28 in 1504 against Swabian besiegers. Bretten was also the place for a traditional competition called “shepherds’ jump”, that was celebrated by all local shepherds. During the 16th and the 18th century several shooting competitions took place, some of them on the Peter and Paul Day. In 1805 a citizen militia was founded in Bretten. Since then the Peter and Paul Festival has been celebrated regularly. After the Revolution in Baden the militias were not allowed to wear weapons anymore and the festival became a children’s festival. In 1923 the militia was refounded and the festival became bigger, with lots of guests and militias from other towns. After World War II the American administration allowed the festival to happen again in 1950, with a new militia and several societies that promoted the mediaeval aspects of the sally in 1504. Nowadays the organising society tends to advance the mediaeval aspects of the festival. Many citizens of Bretten are busy all the year round organising the Festival, preparing their costumes, studying old books, practicing music (especially drumming), fighting, dancing, juggling or practicing other performances. Since the 1980s, the organising society has also engaged professional artists.
The festival also provides a fairground that attracts mainly kids and teenagers. For most citizens and guests the festival is the most important meeting point for former, existing or new friendships, or - as a pupil told the Bretten newspapers: “For me the Peter-and-Paul-Festival is a festival of love”.

ETail

Etail is a sub-category of eCommerce (electronic commerce) that deals with Online Retail. Etail is exclusively related to trading of physical goods through a website with storefront such as a marketplaces. The name is derived from "Electronic Retail", be instead of calling it e-Retail, people started dropping the R. Etail is sometimes written e-Tail or eTail, but that is incorrect, since it would be referring to an electronic tail. Etail is simply a new word and should not be treated as an acronym.
Etail was first covered in The Retail Handbook published in 2011.
Etail was first covered in The Retail Handbook published in 2011: Extract from the Retail Handbook:
Retail has changed unrecognisably in the last few years and we have now seen a few years of strong growth in, and the emergence of, E-commerce – the selling of products to customers via the internet. There are many names for this: online shops, internet shops and E-commerce are the main names used.
I have been part of the ‘internet revolution’ from the late 1990s when I was lucky enough to have an internet connection at my university dormitory.
It was during this time that I realised that internet retailing has always been in retail ... R…etail... Remove the R and you have the word ‘etail’ – so it has always been a part of retail, we just never noticed it.
‘Etail’ is extremely important, and I would now say a pre-requisite for any serious retailer. Whatever you sell and wherever you sell it you must have a website and you should have a transactional E-commerce website.

Etail Conferences.
Etail Conferences is a series of several regional, annual business conferences organized by Worldwide Business Research (WBR) for e-commerce professionals. Etail events feature lectures, panel discussions, workshops, and meetings. 
Etail is any of several regional, annual business conferences organized by Worldwide Business Research (WBR) for e-commerce professionals. eTail events feature lectures, panel discussions, workshops, and meetings.
WBR hosted the first Etail conference in New York City in 1999. WBR, a subsidiary of the PLS Group, organizes business conferences internationally.
The attendance at the first eTail conference impelled WBR to start an eTail conference in the Western United States, as well as in six other countries: Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. The host city for each regional conference may change annually.
WBR did not coin the word "e-tail" or its variant, "etail". "E-tail" is a portmanteau of the words "electronic" and "retail" (cf. email). The earliest documented use of this word as a common noun occurred in 1995.

CEBus

CEBus(r), short for Consumer Electronics Bus, also known as EIA-600, is a set of electrical standards and communication protocols for electronic devices to transmit commands and data. It is suitable for devices in households and offices to use, and might be useful for utility interface and light industrial applications.
History.
In 1984, members of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) identified a need for standards that included more capability than the defacto home automation standard X10. X10 provided blind transmission of the commands ON, OFF, DIM, BRIGHT, ALL LIGHTS ON, and ALL UNITS OFF over powerline carrier, and later infrared and short range radio mediums. Over a six-year period, engineers representing international companies met on a regular basis and developed a proposed standard. They called this standard CEBus (pronounced "see bus"). The CEBus standard was released in September 1992.
CEBus is an open architecture set of specification documents which define protocols for products to communicate through power line wire, low voltage twisted pair wire, coax, infrared, RF, and fiber optics.
The CEBus Standard was developed on the foundation of an IR (infrared) protocol developed by GE (General Electric). This work was transferred to the EIA at the beginning of the EIA's involvement, under the plan that it would be expanded then maintained by the EIA.
Technology.
Powerline carrier.
The CEBus standard includes such things as spread spectrum modulation on the power line. Spread spectrum involves starting a modulation at one frequency, and altering the frequency during its cycle. The CEBus power line standard begins each burst at 100 kHz, and increases linearly to 400 kHz during a 100 microsecond duration. Both the bursts (referred to as "superior" state) and the absence of burst (referred to as the "inferior" state) create similar digits, so a pause in between is not necessary.
A digit 1 is created by an inferior or superior state that lasts 100 microseconds, and a digit 0 is created by an inferior or superior state that lasts 200 microseconds. Consequently, the transmission rate is variable, depending upon how many of the characters are "one" and how many are "zero"; the average rate is about 7,500 bits per second. A 400 microsecond burst is an "end of frame" indicator and also saves time. For example, if the 32-bit destination address field has some of its most significant bits zero, they need not be sent; the "end of frame" delimits the field and all receiving devices assume the untransmitted bits are zero.
CEBus transmissions are strings or packets of data that also vary in length, depending upon how much data is included. Some packets can be hundreds of bits in length. The minimum packet size is 64 bits, which at an average rate of 7,500 bits per second, will take about 1/117th of a second to be transmitted and received.
Other media.
Other media besides powerline carrier are specified: coaxial cable, infrared, radio frequency, and optical fiber. The initial offerings supported only a powerline carrier.
Addresses.
The CEBus standard involves device addresses that are set in hardware at the factory, and include 4 billion possibilities. The standard also offers a defined language of many object oriented controls which include commands such as volume up, fast forward, rewind, pause, skip, and temperature up or down 1 degree.
Common Application Language.
The CEBUS standard includes a large number of control and operation tables, called the CAL contexts. These tables identify a variety of control and monitoring commands that are used by remote devices (elsewhere in a home, or with the Internet, even elsewhere in the world) to communicate with CEBus certified products. The tables include commands for very simple actions, such as power on, power off, change channel, etc. Also included are the possibility for very sophisticated feature and functionality discovery and enumeration. For example, two products can communicate with each other, completely automatically, to discover what capabilities exist in Product A, such that Product B can then display that info, or simply use it to select services available, a sampling being: a list of channels/inputs/outputs available, special capabilities available (like Away Mode, Movie Mode, security parameters, etc.), or data tables within a residential electrical power meter.
This HPnP work expanded upon the EIA-600 foundation, which generally just provides the means by which residential products can physically get packets between each other. CAL contexts added language to further refine EIA-600 so that products can know what features others have to share.
The simplified CEBus standard stack includes HPnP, CAL contexts, CEBus standard, and EIA-600.
Some companies publicly acknowledged as working on HPnP in 1996 include Amp, Honeywell, Intel, IMS, Microsoft, Siemens Meter Division, Thomson Consumer Electronics (Technicolor).
Technologies developed in parallel with HPnP: 1394, IRDA, UPnP.
Manufacturers.
Presently, all of the communications hardware, language, and protocol is available on a chip produced by Intellon Corporation in Ocala, Florida and by Domosys Corporation in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Intellon or Domosys sell the chip to other manufacturers for use in their products, and offer to manufacture private label and OEM products using the CEBus standard. Intellon and Domosys also sell developer kits to develop a CEBus compatible product.
Having moved out of a laboratory and into the market, the CEBus trademark is owned by the EIA. Ongoing developments are conducted by a group known as the CIC (CEBus Industry Council). The CIC is a non-profit organization made up of the representatives of many national and international electronics firms, such as Microsoft, IBM, Compaq Computer Corp, AT&T Bell Labs, Honeywell, Panasonic, Sony, Thomson Consumer Electronics, Leviton, and Pacific Gas & Electric. Anyone can become a member of the CIC by paying an annual fee of $300 to $10,000 and fulfilling certain other requirements.
Although there is no restriction from anyone using the CEBus standard, the CIC is developing a non-profit testing laboratory which will be funded by certification charges. Manufacturers are encouraged to use the testing laboratory to verify the conformance of their product and its performance in a home network environment. When the performance is certified, the manufacturer pays a certification fee and is licensed to include the CEBus logo on their product.

Percy Scholes

Percy Alfred Scholes M.A., Hon.D.Mus. (Oxon), F.S.A., F.R.Hist.S., A.R.C.M., F.T.S.C. (24 July 1877 – 31 July 1958) was an English musician, journalist and prolific writer, whose best-known achievement was his compilation of the first edition of "The Oxford Companion to Music". His 1948 biography "The Great Dr Burney" was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.
He was born in Leeds in 1877 and was educated privately, owing to his poor health as a child. He became an organist, schoolteacher, music journalist, lecturer, an Inspector of Music in Schools to London University and the Organist and Music Master of Kent College, Canterbury (1900), All Saints, Vevey, Switzaland (1902) as well as Kingswood College, Grahamstown, South Africa (1904). He was Registrar at the City of Leeds (Municipal) School of Music (1908-1912). At various times he was music critic for the "Evening Standard", "The Observer" (1920–1927) and the "Radio Times" (1923–1929). He was made an Officer of the Star of Rumania in 1930. He was founder and general secretary of the Anglo-American Conference on Musical Education, Lausanne (1929 and 1931); the president of the Union of Directors of Music in Secondary Schools; founder and editor "The Music Student" (which later became "The Music Teacher"); and during the First World War he directed the Music section of the Y. M. C. A. for the troops at home and abroad. He ended his days in Cornaux, Chamby sur Montreux in Switzerland.
Work.
He wrote over 30 books, mainly concerning music appreciation, but his best-known work is "The Oxford Companion to Music", which was first published in 1938. This work took him six years to produce and consisted of over a million words (surpassing the length of the Bible). Scholes was assisted by various clerical assistants, but wrote virtually all the text himself. The only exceptions were the article on tonic sol-fa (for which he was dissatisfied with his own article) and the synopses of the plots of operas (which he regarded as too boring). Although the "Oxford Companion to Music" was (and is) regarded as authoritative, the text of the first edition is enlivened by Scholes' own anecdotal and sometimes quirky style.
Style.
In his writing for this work, and elsewhere, Scholes never believed in holding back his personal views in favour of a neutral point of view. He is credited with the description of harpsichord music as sounding like "a toasting fork on a birdcage"; when describing Handel and Bach, he said that "Handel was the more elegant composer, but Bach was the more thorough". 
In "The Oxford Companion to Music" itself some composers (Berg, Schönberg and Webern, for example) were described in somewhat unsympathetic and dismissive terms. His article on Jazz states that "jazz is to serious music as daily journalism is to serious writing"; similarly, his article on the composer John Henry Maunder states that Maunder's "seemingly inexhaustible cantatas, "Penitence, Pardon and Peace" and "From Olivet to Calvary", long enjoyed popularity, and still aid the devotions of undemanding congregations in less sophisticated areas."
Scholes' other activities included an early recognition of the possibilities of the gramophone as an aid to knowledge and understanding of music. His "First Book of the Gramophone Record" (1924) lists fifty records of music from the sixteenth to the twentieth century, with a commentary on each; a "Second Book" followed in 1925. From 1930 onwards, Scholes collaborated with the Columbia Graphophone Company in "The Columbia History of Music by Ear and Eye"; this comprised five volumes, each containing an explanatory booklet and eight 78rpm records specially made for the series, including Renaissance vocal and instrumental items performed by Arnold Dolmetsch and his family. 
Death.
Scholes died in 1958, aged eighty-one, in Vevey, Switzerland, where he had been living for many years. Shortly before his death, his "professional" library was acquired by the National Library of Canada. This comprised approximately 50 linear metres of research files and correspondence.
In 1983 Oxford University Press produced "The New Oxford Companion to Music", edited by Denis Arnold, which consciously tried to overcome some of the perceived deficiencies of the Scholes' work. This included taking a more eclectic line on music to be included. Unfortunately this resulted in a rather bulky two-volume work of some 2000 pages. The 2002 edition, edited by Alison Latham, reverted to the original title, and single-volume format.

König's theorem (kinetics)

In kinetics, König's theorem or König's decomposition is a mathematical relation derived by Johann Samuel König that assists with the calculation of kinetic energy of bodies and systems of particles.
For a system of particles.
The theorem expresses the kinetic energy of a system of particles in terms of the velocities of the individual particles.
Specifically, it states that the kinetic energy of a system of particles is the sum of the kinetic energy associated to the movement of the center of mass and the kinetic energy associated to the movement of the particles relative to the center of mass.
For a rigid body.
The theorem can also be applied to rigid bodies, stating that the kinetic energy T of a rigid body, as viewed by an observer fixed in some inertial reference frame N, can be written as:
formula_1
where formula_2 is the velocity of the center of mass of the rigid body, as viewed by an observer fixed in an inertial frame N; formula_3 is the angular momentum of the rigid body about the center of mass, also taken in the inertial frame N; and formula_4 is the angular velocity of the rigid body R relative to the inertial frame N.

Fruiz

Fruiz also known as Fruniz is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the autonomous community of Basque Country, northern Spain.
Place name.
Fruiz is one of the place names of the Basque Country finished in -iz. Julio Caro Baroja defended that the names came from a proper name + the Latin suffix ``-icus``
In the Basque area called vasconavarra Caro Baroja considered that -oz,-ez and-iz suffixes applied to the place names in antiquity indicated that the site had been owned by the person whose name was attached to one of those suffixes, being able to trace their origin from the Middle Ages until the time of the Roman Empire.
In the case of Frúniz, Julio Caro Baroja proposed that the name could come from a hypothetical "Furius" - a latin word. If it is added the -icus suffix to the latin word we get the word "Furicus". From a very similar latin "Furunicus" we could reconstruct the origin of the place-name Frúniz. Furunicus might also be a son of Furious.
Fruniz was established as the proper name of the village, and in the early nineteenth century it was change to Frúniz, after establishing the Royal Spanish Academy in 1763 which forced to use the Spanish accent. However, the name continued developing in the Basque language, losing the intervocalic -n-, a common phenomenon from ancient Basque, which makes the name end up like "Fruiz".
The current name of the town in Basque is Fruiz while the known name in Spain is Frúniz.
In 1994 the city council decided to formalize the Basque form of the name, and since then its has officially been called Fruiz.
History.
The origin of Fruniz dates back to the late eighth century, when Fortunio Fruniz won a battle against the Asturian in Asturiazaga, there he ordered to build a solar house. Their lands produced wheat, corn and beans. In 1781 it was established an annual cattle fair, which was held in the chapel of San Lorenzo. Nowadays it is celebrated on the second Sunday of August in the neighborhood of Aldai. The woods afforded good pasture for cattle fattening and abundant timber for the construction.
Festivities.
In Fruniz there are four main festivities that are celebrated:
On 6 August the "Big Day" of Fruniz is celebrated, "San Salvador". A meal typically called "Herry Bazkari" is typically organized for all the people who want to join whether they are from the village or not.
Agricultural-Livestock Fair is held the second Sunday of August.
On 10 August it is celebrated the feast of San Lorenzo in the chapel located in the Barrio Andeko.
On 29 September it is celebrated in Barrio Botiola the feast of St. Michael.

Owen McCann

Owen McCann (26 June 1907 – 26 March 1994), was a South African cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. Archbishop of Cape Town from 1951 to 1984, he was elevated to the cardinalate in 1965.
Biography.
McCann was born in Woodstock in Cape of Good Hope, and studied at Saint Joseph College in Rondebosch, University of Cape Town, and Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome. He was ordained to the priesthood on 21 December 1935. In 1941, he became editor of "The Southern Cross", South Africa's national Catholic newspaper, and held this post until 1948; he again became editor in 1986, this time for a five-year period. He did pastoral work in Cape Town from 1948 to 1950.
On 12 March 1950, McCann was appointed Apostolic Vicar of Cape Town and Titular Bishop of Stectorium. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 18 May from Archbishop Martin Lucas, SVD, nuncio to South Africa. Upon Cape Town's elevation to a diocese on 11 January 1951, McCann was appointed Archbishop of Cape Town, the first of metropolitan rank. Between 1961 and 1974, he served as President of the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference (SACBC). McCann attended the Second Vatican Council, at which he was elected to the Commission for Bishops and made four written and four oral submissions in his own name and five written ones as president of the SACBC.
McCann was created Cardinal Priest of Santa Prassede by Pope Paul VI in the consistory of 22 February 1965, becoming the first South African to receive the red hat. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the August 1978 papal conclave, which selected Pope John Paul I, and the October 1978 papal conclave, which selected Pope John Paul II. McCann was reportedly a supporter of Giovanni Benelli at the latter conclave, but still gave his praise to the newly elected Wojtyla. Cardinal McCann retired as Archbishop of Cape Town on 20 October 1984.
He died on 26 March 1994, at age 86, and is buried in the archdiocesan cathedral. President Nelson Mandela, in an official condolence statement on the following 28 March, described Cardinal McCann as "one of South Africa's great sons" and "a man of great ability and wisdom".

Clock hypothesis

The clock hypothesis is an assumption in special relativity. It states that the rate of a clock doesn't depend on its acceleration but only on its instantaneous velocity. This is equivalent to stating, that a clock moving along a path formula_1 measures the proper time, defined by:
The clock hypothesis was implicitly (but not explicitly) included in Einstein's original 1905 formulation of special relativity. Since then, it has become a standard assumption and is usually included in the axioms of special relativity, especially in the light of experimental verification up to very high accelerations in particle accelerators.

Holika

Holika () was a demoness in Hindu mythology, who was burnt to death with help of God Vishnu. She was the sister of King Hiranyakashipu and aunt of Prahlad.
The story of "Holika dahan" (Holika's death) signifies the triumph of good over evil. Holika is associated with the annual bonfire on the night before Holi, the Hindu festival of colors.
History.
According to one symbolic Hindu myth, there was a king named Hiranyakashipu who, like a lot of demons and Asuras, had the intense desire to be immortal. To fulfill this desire he performed the required Tapas (penance) until he was granted a boon by Brahma. Since the God's do not usually grant the boon of immortality, he used his guile and cunning to get a boon which he thought made him immortal. The boon gave Hiranyakashyapu five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by "astra" (weapons that are launched) nor by any "shastra" (weapons that are hand held), and neither on land nor in water or air. As this wish was granted, Hiranyakashyapu felt he was invincible, which made him arrogant. Hiranyakashyapu decreed that only he be worshiped as a God, punished and killed anyone who did not accept his orders. His son Prahlad disagreed with his father, and refused to worship his father as a god. He continued believing and worshipping Lord Vishnu.
This made Hiranyakashipu very angry and he made various attempts to kill Prahlad. During a particular attempt on Prahlad's life, King Hiranyakashyapu called upon his sister Holika for help. Holika had a special cloak garment that prevented her from being harmed by fire. Hiranyakashyapu asked her to sit on a bonfire with Prahlad, by tricking the boy to sit on her lap. However, as the fire roared, the garment flew from Holika and covered Prahlad. Holika burnt to death, Prahlad came out unharmed.
Vishnu appeared in the form of Narasimha - half human and half lion, at dusk when it was neither day nor night yet, took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep which was neither indoors nor outdoors, placed him on his lap which was neither land, water nor air, and then used the lion claws to fight Hiranyakashyapu - which was neither a hand held weapon nor a launched weapon. In this form, the boon of five special powers granted to Hiranyakashyapu were no longer useful. Hiranyakashyapu was killed. Prahlad and the kingdom of human beings were thus free from the compulsion and fear of Hiranyakashyapu. The good was victorious over evil.
This symbolic myth is common in some parts of India, where Holi is also called "Phagwah" and Holika is instead called "Pootana" or "Putana". Kamsa, king and uncle of Krishna, sensed danger to his life from his infant nephew when he grows up. Kamsa sends the she demon Putana disguised as a woman to poison the infant under the guise of breast feeding. Baby Krishna sucks not only the poisonous milk but her blood too - forcing her to re-appear in her true form of she demon. She runs, and bursts into flames. Putana dies, while baby Krishna transitions into his characteristic dark blue skin color. The day before "Phagwah" is celebrated by burning "Putana." According to the myth, in his youth, Krishna despairs about fair skinned Radha and whether she or other "Gopikas" (girls) will like him because of his skin color. His mother tired of the desperation, asks him to approach Radha and color her face in any color he wanted. This he does, and Krishna and Radha became a couple. The playful coloring of face of Radha has henceforth been celebrated as Holi.
Origin of Holika Dahan.
For many traditions in Hinduism, Holi celebrates the death of Holika in order to save Prahlad and we see where Holi gets its name. The night before Holi pyres are burnt in North India in keeping with this tradition. It should also be noted that in some parts of India the day is actually called Holika . There are other activities associated with the story of Prahlad, but the burning of Holika is the one that we can most directly associate with Holi. Fire burnt on the eve of Holi (Holika Dahan) symbolizes the burning of Holika. The story as a whole is testament to the power of devotion (bhakta) over the evil represented by King Hiranyakashyapu, as Prahlad never lost his faith.
The burning of Holika is the most common mythological explanation for the celebration of Holi. In different parts of India varying reasons are given for Holika's death. Among those are:

Getxo

Getxo is a town located in the province of Biscay, in the autonomous community of the Basque Country, in the north of Spain.
It is part of Greater Bilbao and Uribe, and has about 83,000 inhabitants. Getxo is mostly an affluent residential area, as well as being the third largest municipality of Biscay.
History.
Getxo was a parish ("elizatea, "anteiglesia'), originally a rural area, including a large beach at the mouth of the Estuary of Bilbao, centered on the little fishing village of Algorta. The parish council met at the church of "Getxoko Andra Mari" (Basque) or "Santa María de Getxo" (Spanish) (both mean Our Lady of Getxo), not far from the headland called Punta Galea.
The town's coat of arms has an oak with two cauldrons chained to its branches and the motto "Kaltea Dagianak Bizarra Lepoan" (Basque for "Who makes evil, the beard at the back").
With industrialisation in the 19th century, some parts of Getxo evolved into residential areas for the rich bourgeois class. A residential area called Neguri (Basque for "Winter Town") came into being. The village of Algorta grew around the church of San Nicolás and the canalisation of the firth, provided for the colonisation of the beach, where a district called Areeta in Basque and Las Arenas (Spanish for "The Sands") was built. Near "Areeta / Las Arenas", on the other side of the road to Bilbao, there grew a working-class district called "Erromo", similar to the one that grew near Neguri: Neguri Langile. Finally, in the 20th century, urban development reached the rural areas of Getxoko Andra Mari.
Getxo, as well as the surrounding area known as Uribe-Kosta, grew rapidly in the last decades of the 20th century. While in the early 80s the town had only 50,000 inhabitants, it has now more than 83,000. The surrounding towns of Leioa, Berango and Sopelana have also seen multiplied their population in the same period.
Getxo was hit by the Basque Conflict several times, with the town being the location of many ETA attacks. The deadliest of these was an ambush in October 1978 when three civil guards were killed and the most recent the car bomb attack on May 19, 2008. Many activists of the organisation have been born in Getxo, such as Arkaitz Goikoetxea.
Administration.
[[Image:Guecho, Gran Bilbao, España. Monumento a Churruca.jpg|thumb|200px|Monument to
Evaristo Churruca in Las Arenas.|left]]
Getxo's office of Mayor has been continuously in the hands of the Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ-PNV) since democracy was restored in 1978 (Local Elections). Since 1991, the major opposition party has been the Partido Popular(PP). Other parties represented on the Town Council are the Socialist Party of Euskadi (PSE-EE) and the United Left (IU).
Getxo has five different districts, which serve administrative and electoral purposes: Algorta, Las Arenas, Romo, Santa María de Getxo and Neguri.
Transport and Tourism.
It is possible to travel to Getxo from Bilbao using the city's modern underground Metro system, which has already 6 stations in the town (Areeta, Gobela, Neguri, Aiboa, Algorta and Bideazabal), and another one under construction (Ibarbengoa-Getxo). Getxo is also accessible from Portugalete, by means of both the "Vizcaya Bridge" transporter bridge and the regular fluvial transport over the Estuary of Bilbao.
The ferry "Pride of Bilbao" reaches Portsmouth from Getxo's neighbour Santurtzi, and Bilbao Airport is also not far away in Loiu.
Getxo has some tourist appeal with easy access to several beaches, and to the regional economic capital of Bilbao. It has a yacht harbour, a golf course, and several sports complexes (both public and private). A dynamic, semi-autonomous Department of Culture organises many events on a regular basis, including several international music festivals given over to jazz, the blues and folk.
The town has many houses of architectural interest, including the Town Hall and several churches, as well as private dwellings belonging to members of the wealthy industrialist class of Biscay. The Old Harbour district of Algorta and several parks with views across to the bay called the Bilbao Abra are also worth a visit.
Festivals.
Several annual festivals are celebrated in Erandio. Some of of them are "fiestas patronales" (patronage festivals, held in the days around the date dedicated to the patron saints under whose advocation churches and hermits are).
Getxo also has festivals for Christmas season. Several neighbourhoods of Getxo celebrate marches with Olentzaros (in Christmas Eve, December 24). And there is a longer Cavalcade of Magi through Algorta and then Las Arenas in January 5.
Basque.
This city offers also the possibility to learn the Basque language in several academies.
Sport.
Since 1924, the "Circuito de Getxo" (Getxo Circuit), a single-day road bicycle race, is held annually in July. Since 2005, the race is organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour.
Every year one of the rowing clubs of Getxo organises a regatta of traineras called Flag of Getxo. Besides, other annual trainera competitions, like the Flag of Santurtzi, the Flag of Getxo and the Grand Prix of Nervión ara also held partly in waters of Getxo.
There are several association football clubs in Getxo. The most famous is the Arenas Club de Getxo football, which plays season 2013-2014 in "Tercera División", but they took part in the first ever national Spanish football league season, stood seven seasons in its First Division and won the 1919 Copa del Rey.
Getxo Rugby Taldea (currently "Getxo Artea") is the local rugby team and play in the División de Honor.
Getxo also has other clubs for golf, Basque traditional sports, Basque pelota, skating, hitch-hiking, cycling, sailing, basketball, surf, fishing, athletics, triathlon, rhythmic gymnastics, handball, futsal, chess, tennis, paddle tennis, horse riding, hockey, boxing, and other sports.
Basque state.
According to the City of Getxo, the 48.56% of the citizens do not have enough knowledge of the basque language, 19.9% speak good Basque and the remaining 31.5% understand but do not dominate.
On the other hand, the percentage of people who can speak Basque has increased, which has risen from 9% in 1981 to 19.9% in 2001. According to the same source, only 4.83% of the population of Getxo uses Basque usually. This figure has grown since the previous measurements, especially among children (3.40% in 1989 to 4.68% in 1997) and youth (1.90% in 1989 to 5.15% in 1997).

In 2007 there were separate EA and PNV. The PNV was again the most voted, but obtained a simple majority of 40% of the valid votes (those of Basque Nationalist Action were considered null), which earned him only six of the 13 councillors. Emma Calzada of the Independent Group was elected mayor of Gorliz, with the votes of his group (4 councillors), the Basque PP (PP-PV, 1 councillor), Ezker Batua - Berdeak - Aralar (1 councillor) and Eusko Alkartasuna (EA, 1 councillor). 1 2 3

Izurtza

Izurtza (in Basque and officially, in Spanish "Izurza") is an elizate, town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country, Spain. Izurtza is part of the "comarca" of Durangaldea and has a population of 270 inhabitants as of 2010 and according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
History.
As happens with most of the elizates, the origins and date of foundation of the town are unknown. According to the local tales, the tower of Etxaburu, which is located on a hill above the town, was built following the orders of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius. The tower was afterwards destroyed by Henry IV of Castile and built again in the 16th century by Sancho López de Ibargüen. Also on this century the church of the town, named "San Nicolás Obispo" was built. Izurtza was part of the "merindad" of Durango, and it had voice and right to vote in the Juntas of Guerendiaga, where it occupied the seat number eleven.
Geography.
Location.
Izurtza is located in the southeastern part of the province of Biscay, northern Spain. It is one of the smallest municipalities of the province by extension. It limits at north and west with Durango, at south with Mañaria and at east with Abadiño. 
Izurtza is situated between the Mugarra and Untxillaitz mountains and the Mañaria River runs through it. The road BI-623 that connects Durango with Vitoria-Gasteiz crosses the town from north to south. Izurtza is made by a small urban core surrounding the BI-623 road and farming houses scattered through the hillsides.
Hydrography.
Izurtza is located in a valley formed by the Mañaria river that originates in the hillsides of the mountains and later joins the Ibaizabal river.
Economy.
Historically, the economy of the municiapality has been linked to the farming exploitations. Since the 20th century, the industrial expansion has caused the primary sector to lose its range as the main economical activity.
Transportation.
The transportation is based on road transportation by the BI-623 road, which connects the town with Durango, the capital city of the "comarca" of Durangaldea and only 1,5 km away. The same road by south connects the town with Mañaria and Urkiola and from there to Otxandio, Dima and the province of Álava. In Durango, the road is connected to the National Road N-634 and the highway AP-8 to Bilbao and Donostia-San Sebastián.

Freshers' Flu

Freshers' Flu is the name commonly given to a battery of illnesses contracted by as many as 90% of new students during the first few weeks at a university, in some form; common symptoms include fever, sore throat, severe headache, coughing and general discomfort
. The illnesses may or may not include actual flu, and is often simply a bad cold, but is so named simply due to alliteration. This is mostly a British term, and is rarely heard outside the UK.
Causes.
The most likely cause is the convergence of large numbers of people arriving from all over the world, many of whom carry pathogens to which they are immune, but others have not had a chance to acquire the necessary immunity. The poor diet and heavy consumption of alcohol during Freshers' Week is also reported as a cause for many of the illnesses contracted during this time. "Stress, which may be induced by tiredness, combined with a poor diet, late nights and too much alcohol, can weaken the immune system and be a recipe for ill health. All this can make students and staff working with the students more susceptible to infections within their first weeks of term." In addition to this, nearly all university academic years in the UK commence around the end of September or beginning of October, which "marks the start of the annual flu season". The increased susceptibility to illness from late nights, heavy alcohol consumption and stress peaks 2–4 weeks after arrival at university and happens to coincide with the seasonal surge in the outbreaks of colds and influenza in the Northern Hemisphere.
Other effects.
As well as the usual viral effects, Freshers' Flu can also have some psychological effects. These effects arise where the stress of leaving home and other consequences of being independent, not to mention various levels of homesickness and the attempts at making new friends, can further weaken the immune system, increasing susceptibility to illness.

Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra

Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra (BIT Mesra), is an autonomous engineering and technology oriented institute of higher education located in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. It is a Deemed University under section 3 of the "UGC Act, 1956".
Since the inception of main campus in Mesra (Ranchi) in 1955, BIT has established campuses in Lalpur (Ranchi), Allahabad, Kolkata, Noida, Jaipur, Patna and Deoghar, and overseas centres in Muscat (Oman)& Ras al-Khaimah (UAE).
History.
The Birla Institute of Technology was established in 1955 at Mesra, Ranchi, Jharkhand by the philanthropist and industrialist B M Birla. The institute was affiliated to Patna University until 1960 and then to Ranchi University. BIT was declared a deemed university in 1986 under section 3 of the "University Grants Commission Act, 1956" under notification No. F. 9-2/83-U.3 August 28, 1986.
BIT was the first institute in India to establish a department of space engineering and rocketry, in 1964. BIT introduced the concept of Small Industries Entrepreneurs' Park and became the first institute in the country not just to provide 'nursery sheds' and central designing and workshop facilities to young entrepreneurs, but also to facilitate the initial project funding.
Small Industries Research and Development Organization (SIRDO) was set up in 1970 as a launching pad for small manufacturing enterprises run by technical graduates of BIT. Companies born from this concept include Meditron, Alcast etc. This idea was appreciated by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and spread to other leading institutes of India such as IITs by the Government as a concept of Science and Technological Entrepreneurs Park (STEP).

Bermudo III of León

Bermudo III (1017 – 4 September 1037), king of León (1028 – 4 September 1037), son of Alfonso V of León by his first wife Elvira Mendes, was the last scion of Peter of Cantabria to rule in the Leonese kingdom. He was called "Emperor in Galicia" in 1025.
In 1029, Count García Sánchez of Castile was about to be married to Sancha of León, the elder sister of Bermudo, an arrangement apparently sanctioned by the king of Navarre, when the count was murdered in the city of León. Sancho III of Navarre then claimed the county of Castile in his wife's name and installed in it their son, Ferdinand, as the new count of Castile. The Navarrese king's policy turned to pure aggrandisement—sometimes ostensibly on behalf of his son and at other times simply on his own behalf. He seized the (linguistic) borderlands between the Cea and the Pisuerga rivers, right above León capital, long a bone of contention between León and Castile. After he had forced the marriage between Fernando and Sancha in 1032, those lands went to Castile as part of her also forced dowry. In 1034, he wrested the city of León itself from Bermudo, who retreated into Galicia. By the time Sancho died in 1035, the "meseta" north of the Duero was dominated by the Pyrenean pocket kingdom of Navarre.
However, for all of Sancho's diplomatic and military skill, one cannot help but think that such a situation was essentially the fortuitous result of having youthful opponents. Certainly the brute facts of geography and demography militated against its continuance. After his death, Bermudo III was immediately received back into León and soon began a campaign to recover from Castile and his brother-in-law the disputed territory between the Cea and Pisuerga. But Ferdinand defeated and personally killed Bermudo III at the Battle of Tamarón on September 4, 1037. Autopsy of his remains shows that he may have suffered death from infantry spears or pikes, after falling from his horse.
Since the latter died without an heir, the kingdom of León now recognized Sancha and her husband as its rulers, and Ferdinand was anointed king in the royal city on June 22, 1038. The dynasty of Navarre had triumphed perhaps, but the united realm of León and Castile with its rimlands of Asturias and Galicia, had become the political center of the north Iberian Christian society.
Marriage.
By his wife Jimena, daughter of Sancho III of Navarre, Bermudo had one child, a son named Alfonso, who was born and died in 1030.

Francie Bellew

Francis "Francie" Bellew (born 25 March 1976) is an Irish Gaelic footballer who played for Armagh. He has won an All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medal, five Ulster Championships and a National League title with the county. He was also awarded an All Star for his performances in 2003.
Bellew plays club football for Crossmaglen Rangers and has won four All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championships, seven Ulster Senior Club Football Championships and 13 Armagh Senior Football Championships with the club.
Bellew usually plays as full back for both club and county. He is known as a hard-hitting and tough old-fashioned full back and these attributes along with his quiet demeanor and reluctance to talk to the media has resulted in him having a cult following among Armagh and Crossmaglen fans. He features in 24 reasons "Why GAA is better than soccer" under #6: John Terry would run a mile if he came up against Francie Bellew.
Playing career.
Inter-county.
Bellew made his Senior inter-county debut for Armagh against Louth in early 2002, and subsequently made his Championship debut against Tyrone later that year. That year he helped Armagh win the Ulster Senior Football Championship as well as the county's first ever All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.
In 2003 Armagh once again reached the All-Ireland final, but were defeated by neighbours Tyrone. He received an All Star award for his performances that year. 2004 saw Bellew and Armagh again win the Ulster Championship.
In 2005 Bellew helped Armagh win the National League, beating Wexford in the final. Later that year he helped Armagh win another Ulster Championship.
Armagh completed a three-in-a-row of Ulster Championships in 2006. Bellew won another Ulster Championship medal with Armagh in 2008, his fifth in all.
Bellew retired from inter-county football in April 2009.
Club.
Bellew is part of the Crossmaglen team that has won 13 Armagh Senior Football Championships in a row between 1996 and 2008. This equals the national record for consecutive county football championships set by Ballina Stephenites of Mayo between 1904 and 1916. He has also won the Ulster Senior Club Football Championship seven times (1996, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008) and the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship four times (1997, 1999, 2000 and 2007) with the club. Bellew, along with Paul Hearty, John McEntee, Tony McEntee, Oisín McConville and Cathal Short is one of six Cross players to have shared in all these successes since 1996.

Payzac, Dordogne

Payzac is a commune in the Dordogne department in Aquitaine in southwestern France.
History.
The commune was written as "Peisac", "Peyzac", "Paysac" and since the late-19th century: "Payzac". The official name Payzac replaced the older name Payzac-de-Lanouaille in 1961.
During the French Revolution on Friday 23 August 1793, the communes of Boisseuilh, Coubjours, Génis, Payzac, Saint-Cyr-les-Champagnes, Saint Mesmin, Salagnac, Savignac, Saint-Trié (Sainte-Trie) and Teillots were detached from the Corrèze department, and reunited to the Dordogne department.
The commune is well known for its Rugby team "l'USPS" (lit. Payzac-Savignac Sporting Union), champion of France 3 in 2000 and in the Périgord-Agenais "regional honor promotion league" in 2007/2008.

Lekeitio

The most important monument is the church of "Santa María", a gothic basilica from the 15th century.
Lekeitio is also the birthplace of Resurrección María de Azkue, one of the most important Basque scholars of the 19th century.
Festivals.
San Antolines.
The festivities are in honor of the patron of the town, San Antolin, and are celebrated from 1 to 8 September. One of the most popular parts of the festival involves geese.
This is held on 5 September, the aim being to hold on for as long as possible to a goose that is hanging from a rope that crosses the harbor from one dock to the other. The rope has one side fixed and on the other side there is a group of men pulling the rope to raise and lower it. In the middle of the rope there is a goose drenched in oil (in previous times the bird was alive). There are a lot of boats that take part and all of them have to go, in the order assigned through a random lottery in the morning, to the place the goose is and one participant from each boat has to grab the goose by the neck as strongly as possible. Once the boat has advanced to the front, the men at the end of the rope start pulling it, lifting the goose with the member holding it. Once the participants reach the top, the men let him drop from there, before rapidly pulling him up again. They continue like that until the participant lets the goose go or until the neck of the goose gets broken. The one who makes most elevations wins the competition.
This day has been documented since the 5th century and it is said that its origins are older. This act has been celebrated since 1877.
The geese run, as it is also called, was also done on land, (and today is still held in Marquina Jemén). Several changes have taken place in this festival because in the past all the boats were sailed by 13 sailors. Only sailors were allowed to participate and there were strict regulations governing the speed and size of the boat, which had to be manned by 12 oarsmen and the captain. If there was any doubt about the winner they arranged a race that went to the island near Lekeitio.
The festival is controversial, especially among animal rights activists, who have called for it to be stopped. During the festival people wear denim work clothes, often combined with a white shirt.

Mallabia

Mallabia (in Basque and officially, in Spanish: "Mallavia") is an elizate, town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country, northern Spain. Mallabia is part of the "comarca" of Durangaldea and has a population of 1.135 inhabitants as of 2006 and according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
Toponymy.
The etymology of the word "Mallabia" may come from the Basque word "malla" ("step", "level" or "height") and "bi(a)" ("two" or "the one with two"), then refers to the place with "two levels" or "two heights".
History.
As it is common with the elizates, the date of foundation of Mallabia is unknown. Its origin is linked with the old "Tierra Llana" (Spanish for "flat lands") of the ancient "merindad of Durango". At some point, it possibly split from the elizate of Zanazaurra (in which lands the elizate of Ermua was founded). Since 1635, Mallabia had voice and right to vote in the "Juntas of Guerendiaga", where it occupied the seat number three. The local church was opened in the 11th century, it was reconstructed in the 16th century and finally finished in 1750.
Geography.
The municipality of Mallabia is located in the eastern part of Biscay. It limits at north with the municipalities of Markina-Xemein and Etxebarria, at south with Zaldibar at east with Eibar (province of Gipuzkoa) and Ermua and at west with Berriz.
Transportation.
The town is crossed by the roads BI-3301 (Ermua-Trabakua), BI-633 (Durango-Ondarroa) and the N-634, which connects the town with Bilbao, Donostia, Durango and Eibar, among others. The nearest highway is the AP-8, which cannot be accessed from the town; the closest access is located in Ermua.
The narrow-gauge regional railways Euskotren does not have a station in the town, despite crossing near to it.

<doc id="2882731" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882731" title="Mañaria">
Mañaria

Mañaria (both in Basque and Spanish) is an elizate, town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country, Spain. Mañaria is part of the "comarca" of Durangaldea and has a population of 459 inhabitants as of 2006 according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
History.
As happens with most of the elizates, little is known about the early history of the town and its foundation. Prehistoric deposits of Magdalenian and Neolithic origin have been found in the caves of Silibranka, Kobazar and Atxuri, among others. A Visigoth liturgical vase of the 7th Century has also been found.
Mañaria was part of the "merindad" of Durango, and it had voice and right to vote in the Juntas of Guerendiaga, where it occupied the seat number four. On the 18th Century the construction of the Royal Road connecting the city of Vitoria with the coast of Biscay going through Urkiola meant the realignment of the town's location, making it the central axis of the municipality. Since mid 18th Century and during the entire 19th Century, Mañaria lived a period of splendor because of the exploitation of its quarries. The church is extended, and the school, the Basque pelota fronton, the tower of the clock and the cemetery are built.
Geography.
Location.
Mañaria is located in the southeastern part of the province of Biscay, which is located in northern Spain. It limits at north with the municipalities of Izurtza and Durango, at west with Dima and at east and south with Abadiño. 
Mañaria is situated on a valley within the course of the Mañaria River and surrounded by mountains; the Mugarra and Untxillaitz the most significant ones. Other important mountains that surround the municipality are the Arrietabaso and Saibi. The road BI-623 that connects Durango with Vitoria-Gasteiz crosses the city from north to south before ascending to Urkiola. More than 70% of the territory of the municipality is part of the Urkiola Natural Park.
Hydrography.
The valley is formed by the Mañaria River that originates in the hillsides of the mountains that surround it. This river later joins the Ibaizabal river.
Economy.
The economy of the municipality is based on mining and industry.
Primary Sector.
The primary sector is based on the exploitation of resources as limestone and marble in quarries, being this the main economical activity of the municipality. Some small farming activities are also present.
Secondary Sector.
The secondary sector is based on the metallurgical transformation. Most of the industries are located in the deeper area of the valley.
Tertiary Sector.
It is almost non-existent due the proximity of bigger cities, as Durango or Bilbao, where most of the services are located.
Transportation.
The transportation is based on road transportation by the BI-623 road, which connects the town with Durango, the capital city of the "comarca" of Durangaldea and 5 km away. The same road by south connects the town with Urkiola and from there to Otxandio, Dima and the province of Álava. In Durango, the road is connected to the National Road N-634 and the highway AP-8 to Bilbao and Donostia-San Sebastián.

Mefo bills followed the scheme for which the Öffa bills were the blueprint.
As Germany was rearming against the terms of the Treaty of Versailles they needed a way to fund rearming without leaving a paper trail; Schacht created this system as a temporary method to fund rearming with only one million Reichsmarks in capital. Schacht has later said that the device "enabled the Reichsbank to lend by a subterfuge to the Government what it normally or legally could not do".
Funding rearmament.
The German government needed to spend a large amount of money to fund the depression era reconstruction of its heavy industry based economy, and ultimately its re-armament industry. However, it faced two problems. First, rearmament was illegal under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and secondly there was a legal interest rate limit of 4.5%.
The government would normally borrow extra funds on the money market by offering a higher interest rate. However, because of the limit it was unable to do so. And a large, visible government deficit would have attracted attention.
An imaginary company.
Hjalmar Schacht formed the limited liability company Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft, m.b.H., or "MEFO" for short. The company's "mefo bills" served as bills of exchange, convertible into Reichsmark upon demand. MEFO had no actual existence or operations and was solely a balance sheet entity. The bills were mainly issued as payment to armaments manufacturers.
Mefo bills were issued to last for six months initially, but with the provision for indefinite three-month extensions. The total amount of mefo bills issued was kept secret.
Essentially, mefo bills enabled the German Reich to run a greater deficit than it would normally have done. By 1939, there were 12 billion Reichsmark of mefo bills, compared to 19 billion of normal government bonds.
This enabled the government to reinflate their economy, which culminated in its eventual rearmament.
Fueling growth.
This strengthened the German economy by providing the government with various goods and services which it was then able to reinvest in the economy, fueling its growth, and preparing it for Hitler's aggressive foreign and domestic policies. Not only did the bills serve the above functions, but they also concealed the military expenditure forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles.

Ray &quot;Gunner&quot; Kelly

Ray "Gunner" Kelly, MBE, (Broken Hill, New South Wales, 1906 - Sydney, 11 August 1977) was an Australian police officer who became famous during his career owing to his high-profile cases and results, but who was later alleged to have been deeply involved in corruption and organised crime.
Biography.
Variously nicknamed "Machine Gun" "Gunner" or "Verbal", Kelly gained national fame as the head of the investigation into the notorious kidnapping and murder of Sydney schoolboy Graeme Thorne in 1960.
Kelly gained further renown in 1966 thanks to his highly-publicised capture of prison escapees Ronald Ryan and Peter John Walker in 1966. However, according to writer Tony Reeves (the biographer of Sydney crime boss Lenny McPherson), Kelly was able to capture the pair easily because they had been betrayed by McPherson. They had come to McPherson seeking his help to leave the country, but McPherson then set up a bogus meeting with Ryan and Walker at Concord Hospital in Sydney and tipped off Kelly.
Kelly often leaked stories to journalist Bill Jenkings of the now-defunct Sydney newspaper "The Daily Mirror". He retired in 1966 as the best-known and best-regarded police officer in Sydney. In March 1966, soon after his retirement, Kelly was hired for a private investigation into the disappearance of the Beaumont children by a Sydney newspaper; he flew to Adelaide, where the South Australian Police welcomed him politely, but he left after only one day.
By the time he died in 1977, however, his reputation had been tarnished by serious corruption allegations, many of which were canvassed in David Hickie's 1985 book "The Prince and The Premier". Hickie and others have alleged that Kelly and Detective Fred Krahe were involved in the protection rackets that fed on Sydney's notorious illegal abortion industry. Kelly also made "no secret" of his association with figures such as notorious abortionist Dr Reginald Stuart-Jones, illegal gaming czars Perc Galea and Joe Taylor and leading Sydney gangsters Charles "Paddles" Anderson and Lenny McPherson.
Reeves quoted a former police officer who said that Kelly "ran" Lenny McPherson as an informant for many years, According to Reeves, Kelly kept the lid on numerous crimes to reward or gain influence over McPherson and others and learned early in his career that he could exert a powerful influence over criminal activities by setting up underworld killings of criminals who could not be controlled by other means.
Kelly was also legendary for his prowess in "verballing" alleged criminals. This practice involved coercing verbal confessions from suspects for offences they may not have committed; Kelly used the practice so effectively that barrister (later Justice) Simon Isaacs nicknamed him "Verbal Kelly".
Kelly acquired the "Gunner" nickname after two incidents early in his career when he drew his service revolver and fired at suspects. It was his successes as a detective that made his name, however, and his talents were used in situations when particular approaches were warranted.
For example, when the British gangster Billy Hill sailed into Sydney with the intention of starting a new life in Australia, Kelly was detailed to ensure that he didn't land. Hill had a legal right to enter the country, so an unorthodox approach was required. Kelly met Hill in his cabin, identified himself, and told Hill that if he stepped off the boat he would return to Britain a week later, in a coffin. Kelly succeeded; Hill stayed on the boat and returned to Britain, and never tried to visit Australia again.
Honours.
Kelly was awarded an MBE in 1975 on the advice of controversial NSW Premier Robert Askin. By this time he was reputed to be the part-owner of an illegal casino in Gosford, New South Wales in partnership with the then NSW Police Commissioner Fred Hanson.
Kelly was later found to be one of the most corrupt police officers in Australia by The Wood Royal Commission into police corruption. This commission described Kelly's involvement in the Mr Asia organised crime syndicate.
Death.
Kelly died of natural causes on 11 August 1977.

Markina-Xemein

Markina-Xemein is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, Bizkaia, in the Basque Autonomous Community, also known as the Basque Country, located in northern Spain. The origin of the town's name lies in its geographic location. The last town in the province of Bizkaia, Markina lies between Gipuzkoa and Bizkaia. Coming from the Spanish word "marca" meaning "mark", Markina-Xemein marks the location where the Gipuzkoanos (the people of Guipuzcoa province) often battled the Bizkainos (the people of Biscay province).
Geography.
Markina-Xemein is located in the north east of Biscay, and it is next to the border with Gipuzkoa. Although the village centre is plain, it is surrounded by hills and mountains, most of them 400 to 700 metres high.Oiz, located to the southwest, is 1,026 metres high.
The main river is Artibai, which passes through Markina-Xemein from southwest to northeast. Near the village centre, it is joined by another river from the southeast, Urko.
Markina-Xemein enjoys a mild climate throughout the year, thanks to being located only 10 kilometers from the coast. Winters tend to be a little bit cool and wet, but not snowy. Although summers are relatively hot, temperatures hardly ever go above 35º Celsius. Apart from that, all the seasons are wet and rainy, so yearly rainfall is above 1550 mm.
History.
The village of Markina (called, in that time, "Villaviciosa de Marquina" in Spanish) was founded by Don Tello, Lord of Biscay (Bizkaia), on May 6, 1355. Don Tello gave permission to the local nobility ("jauntxoak" in Basque or "hidalgos" in Spanish) to create and defend the new village from the attacks of the Gipuzkoan nobility.
One of the most astonishing aspects of that foundation was that Markina was not given a parish church for itself. Moreover, it has had to use the existing church of Xemein, which, at that time, was an independent town (an elizate). The patronage of that church was a hot point in their relations, especially in the Middle Ages, and several disputes took places between local nobility. Last century, (September 29, 1952) Markina and Xemein joined each other to found what we know today as the town of Markina-Xemein.
A further enlargement took place on 1969, when Ziortza-Bolibar (a smaller town located to the southwest of Markina-Xemein) joined the village. That union lasted until January 1, 2005, when all the parts concerned reached an agreement by which Ziortza-Bolibar become an independent town.

Kota Rani

Kota Rani was the last Hindu ruler of Kashmir in Medieval India, ruling until 1339. 
She was the daughter of Ramachandra. Ramachandra had appointed an administrator Rinchan, a Ladakhi. Rinchan became ambitious. He sent a force in the fort in the guise of merchants, who took Ramachandra's men by surprise. Ramachandra was killed and his family was taken prisoners.
To earn local support, Rinchan appointed Rawanchandra, the son of Ramachandra appointed as administrator of Lar and Ladakh, and married his sister Kota Rani. He employed Shah Mir as a trusted courtier, who had entered Kashmir earlier and had been given an appointment in the government.
Rinchan's rule was hard and stern. Richan converted to Islam and adopted the name of Sultan Sadruddin. He died as a result of an assassination after ruling for three years. 
Kota Rani was first appointed as a regent for Rinchan's young son. Later she was persuaded to marry Udayanadeva by the elders. Udayanadeva died in 1338.
Kota Rani had two sons. Rinchana's son was under the charge of Shah Mir and Udayanadeva's son was taught by Bhatta Bhikshana. Kota Rani became the ruler in her own right and appointed Bhatta Bhikshana as her prime minister. 
Shah Mir pretended to be sick, and when Bhatta Bhikshana visited him, Shah Mir jumped out of his bed and killed him. He asked Kota Rani to marry him, but she declined. Shah Mir then attacked her and was forcing her to marry him. Rather than marry him, according to the historian of that period Jonaraja, she committed suicide and offered her intestines to him as a wedding gift.
It is not known what happened to her sons.
Her legacy.
She was very intelligent and a great thinker. She saved the city of Srinagar from frequent floods by getting a canal constructed, named after her and called "Kute Kol". This canal gets water from Jhelum River at the entry point of city and again merges with Jhelum river beyond the city limits.

Plus (TV channel)

Plus was a digital channel run by Granada Sky Broadcasting. It was launched on 1 October 1996 under the original name of Granada Plus, and during its availability it underwent successive rebrands as G Plus, G+ and then simply Plus. However, it remained widely referred to by the public at large by its original name. On 1 November 2004, it was permanently closed down by ITV plc in an attempt to bring its replacement, ITV3, on Sky.
History.
Granada Plus was launched on 1 October 1996 at 19:00. From launch, the channel initially showed only programmes made originally by Granada Television and London Weekend Television (itself recently acquired by Granada Television), such as "On the Buses", "Crown Court", "The Comedians" and "The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club". One of the channel's biggest attractions was a thrice-daily repeat of classic "Coronation Street" episodes from 1976. Broadcasting hours were shared with Granada Men & Motors.
Many of these programmes would have been unshown since their original transmissions, and hence were of value to those interested in classic television, but these early schedules lacked the commercial appeal of rival channel UK Gold, which had long since moved from showing little-seen gems to showing TV's 'greatest hits'.
It wasn't long before Granada Plus revamped their on-screen identity, and in order to look more contemporary, they started showing more recent programmes made by the ITV network (at the time, Granada were busy buying up old rivals such as Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television, in preparation for a unified ITV plc), as well as programme stock which had been originally shown on the BBC. Granada Plus also began screening many classic US shows popular with British viewers and airing promos with the stars of those shows (such as James MacArthur for "Hawaii Five-O", Cheryl Ladd for "Charlie's Angels", Philip Michael Thomas for "Miami Vice" and Ben Murphy for "Alias Smith and Jones"). The channel also aired British premieres of at least three US series: "10-8", "Fortune Hunter" and the 1988 revival of "".
Many of the channel's programmes were cut by up to 5 minutes for commercial timing purposes, which was not a popular choice with viewers. However, come 1 November 2004 — ITV3's launch date — it was looking increasingly likely that ITV plc's new channel would not be launched on Sky Digital. However, frantic discussions were going on behind the scenes: ITV wanted the 7 million or so Sky viewers available; Sky didn't want to give Freeview any advantage; and to further complicate matters, ITV wanted the new channel to be as high up on the EPG as possible. ITV looked into Plus, which was in a high EPG slot, channel 118.
At 15:00 on that day, just 6 hours before launch, ITV and Sky finally reached a deal: ITV would buy out Sky's 49.5% stake in GSB for £10 million. This meant ITV plc completely took full control of the two GSB channels, Plus and Men & Motors.
Shortly afterwards, ITV plc decided to close Plus, and moved ITV2 to channel 118 making room for ITV3. 
An hour-and-a-half later that afternoon, while in the middle of a commercial break, Plus suddenly cut to a closedown slide, and, on digital cable and satellite platforms, shortly afterwards disappeared. The final programme on Plus was "Pie in the Sky", but only half of it was shown before ITV ceased transmission of Plus. Transmission of Plus officially ceased at 17:15, when it was replaced by holding slides for ITV3. The channel was replaced on digital cable and satellite, but on analogue cable, the closedown slide remained for over 5 years. it was removed in the spring of 2011.
The team at Plus were caught unaware as they had sent out their regular highlights email at 15:50. ITV3 launched at 21:00.

Premium-Cola

Premium-Cola is a soft drink brand founded on November 23, 2001, in Hamburg, Germany, by a collective of fans of the German brand Afri-Cola, at the time reduced in caffeine.
The collective (which named itself "Interessengruppe Premium") started by running a protest campaign for more than two years against recipe changes in Afri-Cola.
This well-known German brand (founded 1931) had just been bought by the Mineralbrunnen Überkingen-Teinach AG in 1999, which then secretly changed the recipe: the new Afri-cola contained a reduced amount of caffeine (the original Afri-cola contained 250 mg/L), and the rather strong taste was significantly softened, in order to meet the taste of a wider variety of customers.
The protests of the "Interessengruppe Premium" led to some public awareness, but remained unsuccessful as far as Afri-cola was concerned, so they started producing the original recipe cola on their own and named it Premium-Cola.
To avoid legal issues with the Mineralbrunnen AG, one ingredient had to be changed later in 2004: phosphoric acid instead of malic acid. This didn't change the taste at all, but marked a change of attitude for the collective: The afri-cola brand itself was no longer of interest.
Structure.
There is no office, no salaries, and no actual boss. Members of the company choose to which percent of their time they are going to work for the company. For some members Premium is sort of a hobby next to their actual work or studies, for others it is a full-time job. All issues are decided on collectively, there is hardly any advertising - instead, art pictures are printed on the inside of the bottles' labels.
The collective puts much thought into "proper" brand leading and acting ethically in the economy instead of expanding or selling for any price. Premium-Cola is being sold in selected outlets (not only Clubs and Bars) only, whose philosophy must be similar to that of the brand.

Kütahya

Kütahya () is a city in western Turkey with 237,804 inhabitants (2011 estimate), lying on the Porsuk river, at 969 metres above sea level. It is the capital of Kütahya Province, inhabited by some 564 294 people (2011 estimate). The region of Kütahya has large areas of gentle slopes with agricultural land culminating in high mountain ridges to the north and west.
The city's Greek name was Kotyaion, Latinized in Roman times as Cotyaeum.
History.
Lequien (I, 851) mentions ten bishops, the last in the 14th century. The first is Cyrus, sent thither by Theodosius II, after four bishops had been slain by the inhabitants.
Economy.
The industries of Kütahya have long traditions, going back to ancient times. Kütahya is famous for its kiln products, such as tiles and pottery, which are glazed and multicoloured. Modern industries are sugar refining, tanning, nitrate processing and different products of meerschaum, which is extracted nearby. The local agricultural industry produces cereals, fruits and sugar beet. In addition stock raising is of much importance. Not far from Kütahya there are important mines extracting lignite.
Kütahya is linked by rail and road with Balıkesir to the west, Konya to the southeast, Eskişehir northeast and Ankara east.
Climate.
Kütahya has a warm summer continental climate (Köppen climate classification "Dsb"), with cold and snowy winters and warm and dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn, but can be observed throughout the year.
Culture.
Kütahya's old neighbourhoods are dominated by traditional Ottoman houses made of wood and stucco, some of the best examples being found along Germiyan Caddesi. It has many historical mosques such as Ulu Camii, Cinili Camii, Balikli Camii and Donenler Camii. The Şengül Hamamı is a famous Turkish bath located in the city
The town preserves some ancient ruins, a Byzantine castle and church. During late centuries Kütahya has been renowned for its Turkish earthenware, of which fine specimens may be seen at the national capital. The Kütahya Museum has a fine collection of arts and cultural artifacts from the area.
The house where Hungarian statesman Lajos Kossuth lived in exile between 1850-1851 is preserved as a museum.[http://www.rodosto.hu/en/kutahya.html]
Education.
The Main Campus and the Germiyan Campus of the Kütahya Dumlupınar University are located in the city.

Benazir Bhutto Road

Benazir Bhutto Road, alternatively known as Murree Road (Urdu: مری روڈ), is a major road that runs from Islamabad and Rawalpindi to Murree in Pakistan. It has been a hot spot for various political and social events. Nala Lai, famous for its floods, is located along the road in Rawalpindi. History describes that Nala Lai's water was pure enough to wash clothes, but now it has become polluted with waste water from all sources including factories and houses. Liaquat National Bagh (Park), famous place for political gatherings as well as being the site of the assassinations of two former prime ministers and bystanders is also located along the Murree Road.
On 22 May 2008, it was renamed Benazir Bhutto Road by Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani., but people still call it Murree Road.

Parameter space

In science, a parameter space is the set of all possible combinations of values for all the different parameters contained in a particular mathematical model. The ranges of values of the parameters may form the axes of a plot, and particular outcomes of the model may be plotted against these axes to illustrate how different regions of the parameter space produce different types of behaviour in the model.
Often the parameters are inputs of a function, in which case the technical term for the parameter space is domain of a function.
Parameter spaces are particularly useful for describing families of probability distributions that depend on parameters. More generally in science, the term parameter space is used to describe experimental variables. For example, the concept has been used in the science of soccer in the article "Parameter space for successful soccer kicks." In the study, "Success rates are determined through the use of four-dimensional parameter space volumes."
In the context of statistics, parameter spaces form the background for parameter estimation.
As Ross (1990) describes in his book:
The idea of intentionally truncating the parameter space has also been advanced elsewhere.
Examples.
For some values of "r", this function ends up cycling round a few values, or fixed on one value. These long-term values can be plotted against "r" in a bifurcation diagram to show the different behaviours of the function for different values of "r".
The famous Mandelbrot set is a subset of this parameter space, consisting of the points in the complex plane which give a bounded set of numbers when a particular iterated function is repeatedly applied from that starting point. The remaining points, which are not in the set, give an unbounded set of numbers (they tend to infinity) when this function is repeatedly applied from that starting point.
History.
Parameter space contributed to the liberation of geometry from the confines of three-dimensional space. For instance, the parameter space of spheres in three dimensions, has four dimensions—three for the sphere center and another for the radius. According to Dirk Struik, it was the book "Neue Geometrie des Raumes" (1849) by Julius Plücker that showed
The requirement for higher dimensions is illustrated by Plücker's line geometry. Struik writes

Kate Ziegler

Kate Marie Ziegler (born June 27, 1988) is an American freestyle and long-distance swimmer. Ziegler has won a total of fifteen medals in major international competition, including eight golds, five silvers, and two bronze spanning the World Aquatics and the Pan Pacific Championships. She was a member of the 2012 United States Olympic Team, and competed in the 800-meter freestyle event at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Early years.
Ziegler was born in Fairfax, Virginia in 1988, the daughter of Don and Cathy Ziegler. She attended Bishop Denis J. O'Connell High School in Arlington County, Virginia, a Washington, D.C. suburb. At Bishop O'Connell, she excelled throughout her four years, earning "Washington Post" All-Met honors four straight years, including being Swimmer of the Year on more than one occasion. As a freshman, she finished third in the 200-yard freestyle (1:51.59) and won the 500-yard freestyle (4:47.78) at the 2003 Metros Swimming and Diving Championships, breaking the then-15-year-old record in the 500 held by Pam Minthorn. She also anchored O'Connell's 200-yard freestyle (24.51 split) and 400-yard freestyle (53.65 split) to seventh and sixth place finishes, respectively. The following year, as a sophomore, she won both the 200-yard freestyle (1:46.15) and the 500-yard freestyle (4:41.91) in record time, and anchored the winning 200-yard freestyle (24.14 split) and third place 400-yard freestyle (51.63 split) relays. Her times continued to drop rapidly, and as a junior she again won both the 200-yard freestyle (1:45.43) and 500-yard freestyle (4:37.67) in record time, the latter being an Independent National High School record. As a senior, she continued to excel, tying the National High School record in the 200-yard freestyle (1:45.49) and breaking Janet Evans' USA Record in the 500-yard freestyle (4:35.35).
Ziegler initially attended George Mason University, and later transferred to Chapman University in 2011.
She is a devout Roman Catholic and talked about her faith life on the national sports radio show Blessed2Play hosted by Ron Meyer.
International career.
2004-2005.
At the 2004 Short Course Worlds, she finished second to Japan's Sachiko Yamada in the 800-meter freestyle with a time of 8:20.55. Her 400-meter split would have placed fourth in the event at the meet.
In February 2005, at the FINA World Cup stop in New York, Ziegler won the 800-meter freestyle in 8:16.32, breaking Cynthia Woodhead's 25-year-old American record, which at the time was the oldest American record on the books.
In 2005, Ziegler won the 800-meter freestyle (8:25.31) and 1,500-meter freestyle (16:00.41) at the World Championships in Montreal. The latter time made her the third-fastest woman (and second American) in the history of the event, following only world-record holder Janet Evans's 15:52.10 and German Hannah Stockbauer's 16:00.18. She qualified for Worlds after winning the 800-meter freestyle at World Trials in Indianapolis with a time of 8:34.83. She failed to qualify in the 400-meter fresstyle, finishing third in a time of 4:12.09.
2006-2008.
At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, she swam the 1,500-meter freestyle in 15:55.01 making her the second fastest swimmer of all time in that event and only the second person to break the sixteen-minute mark. The third person was Hayley Peirsol who finished the event just two seconds later.
In 2007, at a in-season meet, Ziegler broke Janet Evan's long standing world record in the 1500-meter freestyle with 15:42.54. It stood for 6 years, until Katie Ledecky broke the record in 2013.
At the 2007 World Championships, she won the 800-meter freestyle and 1,500-meter freestyle, to defend the titles she had won in 2005.
In 2008, Ziegler qualified for the Olympic Games by placing second to Katie Hoff in both the 400-meter (4:03.92) and 800-meter (8:25.38) freestyle events. In Beijing, however, Ziegler failed to qualify for the finals in either event. Notably, her best time in the 800-meter would have netted her a silver medal.
2012 Summer Olympics.
At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, the U.S. qualifying event for the Olympics, Ziegler made the U.S. Olympic team for the second time by placing second in the 800-meter freestyle with a time of 8:21.87, behind first-place finisher Katie Ledecky. She also competed in the 400-meter freestyle and finished seventh in the final (4:09.17).
At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Ziegler, swimming in the fastest qualifying heat of 800-meter freestyle, posted a time of 8:37.38 behind Rebecca Adlington of Great Britain and Lauren Boyle of New Zealand. Only the top eight swimmers of all five qualifying heats advanced to the 800-meter finals (with 8:27.15 as the slowest times of those eight), and Ziegler did not advance.

<doc id="2882854" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882854" title="Longitude by chronometer">
Longitude by chronometer

Longitude by chronometer is a method, in navigation, of determining longitude using a marine chronometer, which was developed by John Harrison during the first half of the eighteenth century. It is an astronomical method of calculating the longitude at which a position line, drawn from a sight by sextant of any celestial body, crosses the observer's assumed latitude. In order to calculate the position line, the time of the sight must be known so that the celestial position i.e. the Greenwich Hour Angle (Celestial Longitude - measured in a westerly direction from Greenwich) and Declination (Celestial Latitude - measured north or south of the equational or celestial equator), of the observed celestial body is known. All that can be derived from a single sight is a single position line, which can be achieved at any time during daylight, when both the sea horizon and the sun are visible. To achieve a fix, more than one celestial body and the sea horizon must be visible. This is usually only possible at dawn and dusk.
The angle between the sea horizon and the celestial body is measured with a sextant and the time noted. The Sextant reading is known as the 'Sextant Altitude'. This is corrected by use of tables to a 'True Altitude' . The actual declination and hour angle of the celestial body are found from astronomical tables for the time of the measurement and together with the 'True Altitude' are put into a formulae with the assumed latitude. This formulae calculates the 'True Hour Angle' which is compared to the assumed longitude providing a correction to the assumed longitude. This correction is applied to the assumed position so that a position line can be drawn through the assumed latitude at the corrected longitude at 90º to the azimuth (bearing) on the celestial body. The observer's position is somewhere along the position line, not necessarily at the found longitude at the assumed latitude. If two or more sights or measurements are taken within a few minutes of each other a 'fix' can be obtained and the observer's position determined as the point where the position lines cross.
The azimuth (bearing) of the celestial body is also determined by use of astronomical tables and for which the time must also be known.
From this it can be seen that a navigator will need to know the time very accurately so that the position of the observed celestial body is known just as accurately. The position of the sun is given in degrees and minutes north or south of the equational or celestial equator and east or west of Greenwich, established by the English as the Prime Meridian. 
The desperate need for an accurate chronometer was finally met in the mid 18th century when an Englishman, John Harrison, produced a series of chronometers that culminated in his celebrated model H-4 that satisfied the requirements for a ship-board standard time-keeper. 
Other nations, notably the French, proposed their own reference longitudes as a standard, the world’s navigators have generally come to accept as the standard the reference longitude adopted by the British who, incidentally, were also the first to create a working chronometer. The reference longitude adopted by the English became known as the Prime Meridian and is now accepted by most nations as the starting point for all longitude measurements. The Prime Meridian of zero degrees longitude runs along the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England. Longitude is measured east and west from the Prime Meridian. To determine "longitude by chronometer", a navigator requires a chronometer set to the local time at the Prime Meridian. Local time at the Prime Meridian has historically been called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) but now, due to international sensitivities, has been renamed as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
Noon sight for longitude.
Noon on the Prime Meridian occurs at 1200 hours UTC. The Sun moves west from that point at a rate of 15 degrees each hour. Therefore, solar noon at 15 degrees west longitude would take place at exactly 1300 hours UTC. Solar noon at 30 degrees west longitude would take place at 1400 hours UTC. A navigator uses his sextant to track the rise of the Sun in the sky to determine the exact moment that it reaches its highest point in the sky—local apparent noon. The navigator then notes the UTC (on his chronometer) at this local apparent noon. By subtracting from the UTC of local apparent noon, 1200 UTC and multiplying the result by the Sun’s movement of 15 degrees for each hour's difference, a navigator can calculate the number of degrees of longitude the Sun has crossed from the Prime Meridian to his current meridian of longitude. For example, if the navigator reads 1704 hours UTC on his chronometer at his local apparent noon, he can subtract 1200 hours UTC to arrive at 5 hours and 4 minutes of travel time for the Sun at a rate of 15 degrees per hour or one degree in 4 minutes. Multiplication results in a calculation of 75 degrees west longitude plus one additional degree of west longitude to account for the :04 minutes of time past 1700 hours for a total of 76 degrees west longitude. In the time lapse from local apparent noon at the Prime Meridian to the local apparent noon at the navigator's position, the Sun has travelled 76 degrees west. Incidentally, with the same sextant sight values, the UTC of local apparent noon and the Nautical Almanac, the navigator can also determine his latitude thereby achieving a positional fix with a single noon shot of the Sun. The significance of the noon sight of the Sun has made it an integral component of nautical lore.
Longitude cannot accurately be measured at noon, when it is very easy to determine the observer's latitude without knowing the exact time. At noon the sun's change of altitude is very slow so determining the exact time that the sun is at its zenith is impossible to measure to the degree of accuracy necessary to give an accurate longitude.
Corrections to the process.
Unfortunately, the Earth does not make a perfect circular orbit around the Sun. Due to the elliptical nature of the Earth’s true orbit around the Sun, the speed of the Sun’s apparent orbit around the Earth varies throughout the year and that causes it to appear to speed up and slow down very slightly. Consequently, noon at the Prime Meridian is rarely if ever exactly at 1200 UTC, but rather it occurs some minutes and seconds before or after that time each day. This slight daily variation has been calculated and is listed for each day of the year in the Nautical Almanac under the title of “Equation of Time”. This variation must be added to or subtracted from the UTC of local apparent noon to improve the accuracy of the calculation. Even with that, other factors, including the difficulty of determining the exact moment of local apparent noon due to the flattening of the Sun’s arc across the sky at its highest point, diminish the accuracy of determining longitude by chronometer as a method of celestial navigation. Accuracies of less than error in position are difficult to achieve using the "longitude by chronometer" method. Other celestial navigation methods involving more extensive use of both the Nautical Almanac and sight reduction tables are used by navigators to achieve accuracies of one nautical mile (1.9 km) or less.
Time sight.
Time sight is a general method for determining longitude by celestial observations using a chronometer; these observations are reduced by solving the navigational triangle for meridian angle and require known values for altitude, latitude, and declination; the meridian angle is converted to local hour angle and compared with Greenwich hour angle.
If Dec is the declination of the observed celestial body and Ho is its observed altitude, the local hour angle, LHA, is obtained for a known latitude B by:
formula_1
The time sight was a complement to the noon sight or latitude by Polaris in order to obtain a fix.

Knut Ahnlund

Knut Emil Ahnlund (24 May 1923 – 28 November 2012) was a Swedish literary historian, writer, and member of the Swedish Academy.
Ahnlund, who was born in Stockholm, was an expert on 19th and 20th century Nordic, especially Danish, literature. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on Henrik Pontoppidan, and later wrote on Gustav Wied and Sven Lidman, among others. He was also a novelist and published translations of various writers such as Julio Cortázar. He received his doctorate from Stockholm University, and was a professor of Nordic Literary History at the University of Aarhus. He was elected a member of the Swedish Academy in 1983.
Due to conflicts with the former permanent secretary of the Academy, Sture Allén, and his successor, Horace Engdahl, Ahnlund had only participated minimally in the work of the Academy from 1996 until his death in 2012. On 11 October 2005, just a few days before the announcement of the 2005 Nobel laureate for literature, he declared in a piece in "Svenska Dagbladet" that he would leave the Academy in protest against the choice of recipient of the prize the previous year, Elfriede Jelinek; he characterized Jelinek's work as chaotic and pornographic. As a membership in the Academy is for life, Ahnlund was not able to formally leave the Academy during his lifetime, but did not participate in its work from 1996 and his chair was left empty until his death.

Perfect 10 (song)

"Perfect 10" is a song by The Beautiful South, released in 1998. It reached number two in the UK charts. The song also appeared on their album "Quench".
The song consists of a series of comments and puns about a relationship between a man and woman using clothing sizes and penis length in the lyrics. The title itself is a pun in that it is reference to the men's magazine of the same name. It also has a double meaning – "Perfect 10" referring to a person who scores 10 out of 10 for attractiveness and desirability, but also referring to a size 10 (in UK women's clothing measurement) which the male singer (Paul Heaton) suggests is the perfect size for his woman, while the female singer suggest 8 inches is the perfect penis size.
Other weight and size-related lyric puns in the song include: ""Anorexic chicks, the model 6, they don't hold no weight with me"", and from the female singer (Jacqui Abbott): ""If he's XXL, well what the hell, every penny don't fit the slot"" and ""When he's at my gate, with a big fat 8, you wanna see the smile on my face"".
"Perfect 10" was seen as a 'tour classic' by The Beautiful South and it has been stated by Dave Stead that "There are certain songs you just can't leave out...I think we would be lynched if we didn't play "Keep It All In", "Don't Marry Her" and "Perfect 10"."
This song also features in a episode of sitcom "Phoenix Nights", where compere Jerry St Clair sings it in his own style.
"Perfect 10" also featured as the theme song of UK television series "Fat Friends".
Paul Weller guested on guitar.

KDAY

KDAY in Redondo Beach, California, (93.5 FM) is one of a pair of synchrocasting radio stations based in South Los Angeles that airs a Urban Contemporary format aimed at African Americans in the 18-49 range. KDAY is owned by Meruelo Radio Holdings, LLC and broadcasts at 93.5 MHz on the FM dial.
From 2004 to 2008, KDAY and KDAI in Ontario, California were a pair of synchrocasting radio stations serving LA/Orange County and Riverside/San Bernardino. But on August 14, 2008 both stations ended their simulcast as KDAY increased its signal coverage and began focusing on the Los Angeles area as a hybrid Urban/Talk outlet targeting 18-49-year-olds, while KDAI became KWIE and flipped to a Rhythmic Adult Contemporary format covering the Inland Empire. In September 2009, KWIE dropped the Rhythmic AC format and returned to simulcasting KDAY as KDEY-FM.
The studios for KDAY are located in the Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles, and its transmitter is located on a site in Baldwin Hills.
History.
The "Original" KDAY.
KDAY is a resurrection of the original R&B/dance/pop and Hip-Hop station of the 1970s and 1980s, KDAY AM 1580. During the 1980s, KDAY featured R&B, Hip-Hop and 1980s L.A. Disco/HI-NRG, and became the first station in the world to go Hip-Hop around the clock. KDAY also helped bring into prominence the West Coast rap scene. Its musical director, afternoon host Greg Mack 'The Mack Attack', brought prominence to hip-hop group N.W.A. It also had earlier launched the careers of N.W.A. core members Dr. Dre and DJ Yella with their World Class Wrecking Cru, a popular mix show of the time.
Those instrumental in bringing "The Original" KDAY's R&B/Dance music format (during the 1970s and early 1980s) to a 4.0 Arbitron rating prominence, included early radio pioneers; Russ Parr, Steve Woods, JJ Johnson, Don Tracy, Dereke Clements (PR/Pub. Aff. Dir.), Roy Latimer (News), Doug Banks, Jack Patterson, Roger Aldi (News), and Jon Badeaux (Director of Production and Music Director). Community-based public affairs involvement and larger than life promotions including; 1580 KDAY Gold Give-A-Way, basketball games at the L.A. Lakers Forum with The Jacksons and Cameo, Bike-A-Thon with the Sylvers and Funkadelics, and the Annual KDAY Toys for Tots Drive with Lakeside, Shalamar and Side Effect, helped to make 1580 KDAY 'the most popular music radio station' in the Los Angeles market.
Lee Marshall 'King News', 'The Brown Beauty On Duty' Jesse Torrero, Lisa Canning, Mark Morganella, Tony G, The High Energy Mixers Hazze (aka Hamburgar Helper), and DJ Eddie (aka La Flavour), Rory Kaufman, Ed Kirby (General Manager), Andy Laird (chief Engineer), and so many others during this era, helped to make 'AM Stereo 1580 KDAY' the power house of innovation, change, and musical leadership in the Hip-Hop, R&B, and Dance Music Worlds. With shows like the Traffic Jam, Friday Night Live, The High Energy Show, World On Wheels, Skateland USA, custom song mixes, interviews, heavy community service in schools, community centers, youth and church groups, community events, and the in street cutting edge programing, contests, and freshness, many major players in the radio and record business got their careers going on this odd 50,000 watt AM directional signal in Los Angeles. If an artist came to the West Coast, KDAY was their destination in Los Angeles.
AM 1580 was sold in 1991 to realtor Fred Sands (who also owned iconic heavy metal station KNAC); it officially went off the air on March 29 of that year. Hours before that, phone calls were streaming into the station as the on-the-air DJs encouraged KDAY listeners to protest against the shutting down of the station. It was too late and KDAY turned into business-oriented radio station KBLA later that day. The final songs played that signaled the end of the original KDAY was "Ain't No Future in Yo' Frontin'" by MC Breed and "Turn Off the Lights" by Teddy Pendergrass. After that, silence came to one of the AM band's last new music stations in the Los Angeles market.
Currently, KBLA is a Spanish-language evangelical Christian station.
Current KDAY.
KDAY was resurrected on 93.5 FM in September 2004, offering a rhythmic contemporary format that emphasized on old school hip-hop, a nod to their AM heritage. In April 2006, KDAY began moving away from a Rhythmic Contemporary direction to an Urban Contemporary approach as 
the station refocused its target audience towards African Americans. This was probably in response to competitor KPWR tilting back from Urban to Rhythmic in order to target Hispanic listeners. Due to sinking ratings, a month later, long-time hip-hop/R&B station KKBT eliminated hip hop from the format in favor of becoming a mixture of Urban AC and urban talk radio, similar in format to KHHT and KJLH. (Only afterwards did KKBT change its calls and name to KRBV "V-100"). In addition, KDAY brought Steve Harvey on board on Memorial Day Weekend, 2006. Harvey had been released by KKBT the previous year. Weeks later, rival KKBT signed on Tom Joyner to carry his syndicated morning show there, but in December 2006, KKBT would ax Joyner due to low ratings, partly attributed to Harvey's success. Technically, the Steve Harvey Show plays R&B music on an Urban AC format, which backs up KDAY's Urban Contemporary format. Since the format altering, KDAY added slow jams during late evening hours and gospel music on Sunday mornings.
On July 23, 2007, KDAY/KDAI temporarily moved from an Urban Contemporary format to a rhythmic format under the consultancy of Harry Lyles and newly installed PD Theo. In a statement to the website All Access, Lyles commented to the changes: "I am very excited and thrilled to be working with Don McCoy, Roy Laughlin and Theo. All we're doing is playing to the taste of Los Angeles and if we play what they want, they will listen. With PPM coming, this will make things a lot more interesting in Los Angeles." The format turnback might have been spurred by Magic's sale of KWIE. The KDAY call letters were originally intended to be dropped in favor of the station changing to "Wild 93.5" and picking up KWIE calls in its place. For a time, the station only referenced itself as "93.5" in the promos until it could come up with a name and calls to fit the rhythmic format. This happened in July 2007, when the sale of KWIE "Wild 96.1" was completed to Liberman Broadcasting and that station became KRQB. The KWIE call sign moved to the Ontario station, which was KDAI. After the sale was completed, it turned out that the format altering was only temporary so they could have the KWIE listeners in the Riverside/San Bernardino area migrate to the 93.5 signal, as KDAY reverted to urban contemporary the following August.
On April 8, 2008, Radio One inked a deal with KDAY, which saw the station pick up the former "Beat" logo and several syndicated shows from Radio One. The move came after Radio One sold KRBV to Bonneville International, who in turn dropped KRBV's Urban AC format the previous day (April 7, 2008); that station is now KSWD. From that point, the station used the slogan "The Beat of LA," a nod to the popular hip-hop station during the 1990s and early 2000s (decade). Michael Baisden, host of the syndicated afternoon show "Love Lust and Lies", returned to Los Angeles on KDAY on August 18, 2008, as KRBV previously aired the show until the format switch.
On August 14, 2008, KDAY was upgraded from 3.4Kw to 4.2Kw, thanks to a new tower that gave the station more coverage in the metro. The new tower will replace its former one, which had been in use for fifty years. Another move was the alteration of its Mainstream Urban format, as KDAY tweaked its direction to a hybrid Urban Adult Contemporary/Urban Talk approach (a direction similar to Urban AC, but featuring current adult-friendly R&B music with and on-air talk personalities and some Hip-Hop product) targeting an 18-49 audience, with most of its programming being filled by syndicated shows during the day, except for DJ Theo's slow-jam show "Theo After Hours," which aired live from 8PM to 12AM weekdays. The move also ended the simulcasts of both KDAY and KWIE, as the latter flipped to Rhythmic Adult Contemporary and targeted the Inland Empire on the same day.
Despite the changes, there had been criticism from listeners over KDAY's decision to move away from being a station that once supported Hip-Hop and a live airstaff to one that featured syndicated shows and an Urban Adult Contemporary/Talk format, claiming that the owners had ruined the legacy of both KDAY and "The Beat". Those upset with that new approach predicted its demise as it was already tried before (and failed) at KKBT, while also feeling that Los Angeles could not support two Adult R&B outlets (referring to KDAY's main competitor, KJLH; KHHT is a Rhythmic AC aimed at Hispanics). But according to station management, the decision to tweak the format was due to Arbitron's plans to implement the PPM in the Los Angeles radio market and where they feel they can tap into certain areas where they can attract the African American audience. The new changes resulted in R&R and BDS removing the station from the Urban reporting radio panel in its August 29, 2008 issue.
Changes.
There had been hints of possible changes coming over the past several months, which became evident in its decision to replace Mo'Nique's syndicated show in October 2008 for more music-driven local content. Another move would come with Theo's exit several weeks later. As a result, KDAY made a shift back to Urban and was reinstated to R&R/BDS' Urban panel in January 2009. The following March, KDAY re-added local air personalities to its lineup, with DJ Dense taking middays and Tha Goodfellas, who had been handling afternoons and weekends, was moved to the 7–10 pm slot. The Steve Harvey morning show was dropped on May 29, 2009, but later resurfaced on KJLH. In addition, Michael Baisden's nationally syndicated show, which aired in the afternoon drive, was dropped on Friday, July 31, 2009. Keith Sweat's nationally syndicated show, "The Keith Sweat Hotel", was next in line to be dropped from KDAY.
At the "Fresh Fest" concert in Downtown Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre, hints were made on stage that a full-blown format flip to resemble the original KDAY's Classic Hip Hop sound would occur on Monday, August 17, 2009 at 7:30 am, when they would drop the branding of The Beat and become simply KDAY. The new logo was shown on all stage banners and screen graphics.
As promised, the change came that very Monday morning with Boyz II Men's "End Of The Road" signaling the wrap of the old format, and Snoop Dogg's "Gin & Juice" being the first song under the new format. Station spots in between songs indicated that the previous syndicated fare was a programming mistake that did not reflect what Los Angeles fans were looking for and that the station would "never do that again." It officially left Los Angeles as the largest market without an urban contemporary station, unseating Houston, Texas in that title.
In a press release, the station's PD/OM, Adrian (A.D.) Scott, explained in detail: "The landscape of Los Angeles radio has been ever changing over the last several years and the programming at 93.5 is taking an exciting turn for the better. “The Beat” will be dropped as focus is placed on the brand equity in KDAY and its deep musical roots. Los Angeles has been missing the west coast sound. By eliminating syndicated programming, KDAY can now focus on its strengths as a local, independent station that connects with the diverse culture that is Los Angeles. With a mix of the old school and the new music that is enjoyed today, I feel we have a unique and winning recipe." While they may have returned to the format, KDAY still plays many classic hip hop songs without live DJs on the air. In September 2009, KWIE, after splitting from KDAY to broadcast a Rhythmic Hot AC format to target the Riverside-San Bernardino market, returned to simulcasting KDAY's format.
In November 2009, station management at KDAY made more changes by bringing in veteran programming consultants Bill Tanner and Steve Smith to help evolve the station alongside PD Scott, new OM Brian Bridgman and new GM Zeke Chaidez. In an interview from All Access, Tanner explained what was in store for KDAY pertaining to the future adjustments for the format: "Brian, Steve and I have offered some refinements based on our many years of experience in Los Angeles," then added that "We’re just getting started with the music. We will be adding jocks and more surprises in the weeks ahead." Mixing was soon brought back to the station with the additions of Mr. A.D, Eddy Xpress, DJ Class1c and DJ Dense.
As of early 2012, KDAY has added more current Hip hop and R&B into its playlist, but still retains old school.
Currently, KDAY competes with urban contemporary radio station KJLH and rhythmic oldies station KHHT.
Change of Ownership.
On December 27, 2010, Radio-Info reported that the KDAY/KDEY simulcast had been sold by Magic Broadcasting to SoCal935, LLC for $35 million. The principal investors Warren Chang and John Hearne also have a financial stake in recent Riverside Rhythmic Top 40 station KQIE. The FCC approved the sale on December 8, 2011. However, even after three extensions of time to consummate the sale, the transfer of ownership never took place.
On April 10, 2013, Lance Venta of RadioInsight reported that KDAY/KDEY were both sold again, this time to RBC Communications, a group led by Chinese/Hong Kong broadcaster Phoenix Television and its editor-in-chief and current affairs anchor Anthony Yuen. However, on October 1, LA Weekly reported that RBC had pulled out from the deal marking the 2nd failed attempt by Magic to sell off KDAY.
History of 93.5 FM.
The 93.5 frequency, in Redondo Beach, signed on in the early 1960s as KAPP-FM. Chuck Johnson and Lonnie Cook came to 93.5 from 103.9 in Inglewood. The frequency was shared as the signal's programming came from Redondo Beach in the daytime, and the Pop / Blues / Doo Wop / Jazz format being aired by Johnson and Cook(from Chuck's home) at night. It has been determined that their FM Top 40 chart is the oldest one known to exist. In 1960 Alan Freed [http://alanfreed.com], who signed off at WABC in NYC, appeared for a short while on KDAY.
The next known transmission of 93.5 was KKOP and it played mellow pop music. One of the station's early owners was game show producer Jack Barry, who later stated that he bought the station specifically because it would require him to have a license from the FCC, and that if the FCC would be willing to grant him a license, it would effectively show that he no longer was "tainted" by the game show scandals.
Later in the 1970s the call letters KFOX were assigned to the station, which like its predecessor at 1280AM (now KFRN) played country music. The format in the early 1980s was an adult contemporary hit music station, with several soon to be very well known disc jockeys like Brian Thomas and Steve Lehman. In 1981/1982, 93.5 KFOX employed LA's Youngest Disc Jockey at the time, a 16 year old student of Torrance High School, Brett Nordhoff, who later changed his on air name to Kidd Kelly. By 1983, the owner decided to sell blocks of air time to various producers; KFOX evolved into a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual format such as Radio Rangarang (Persian), Radio Omid (Persian) and Radio Naeeri (Armenian). In the mid-1990s, this became "Radio Korea USA" with an all-Korean format. This continued until 1999, when the Church of the Foursquare Gospel, which, as a condition of selling 96.3 KXOL-FM moved the KFSG call letters and format to 93.5, which was acquired by 96.3's new owners, Spanish Broadcasting System, specifically for the purpose of relocating KFSG. In 2002, the lease arrangement with Foursquare ended, and SBS switched to a Spanish-language outlet, first as KMJR (La Mejor) and later KZAB.
Notable alumni.
Comedian George Carlin got his West Coast break at KDAY with original comedy partner Jack Burns as a morning team in the early 1960s. The pair spent much of their down time rehearsing their sketches for local coffee house performances. When those performances went well, they soon left radio for touring and television. Carlin asked that his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame be placed outside the KDAY studios.
Wolfman Jack did a program in the early 1970s at the original KDAY(AM) (licensed to Santa Monica) after his departure from border blaster station XERB (then at 1090-AM which is now XEPRS).

George Chinnery

George Chinnery (Chinese: ; 5 January 1774 – 30 May 1852) was an English painter who spent most of his life in Asia, especially India and southern China.
Early life.
Chinnery was born in London, where he studied at the Royal Academy Schools. His father was an exponent of the Gurney system of shorthand; his elder brother William Chinnery owned what is now Gilwell Park in Essex, before he was discovered to have committed large-scale fraud, and fled to Sweden. George Chinnery moved in 1796 to Ireland, where he enjoyed some success as an artist, and married Marianne (née Vigne) on 19 April 1799 in Dublin.
Career.
Chinnery returned to London in 1801 without his wife and two infant children. In 1802 he sailed to Madras (Chennai) on the ship Gilwell. He established himself as a painter there and then in Calcutta (Kolkata), where he became the leading artist of the British community in India.
By 1813 Chinnery was a freemason, listed as a member of Calcutta's well-to-do masonic lodge "Star in the East". This was one of three masonic lodges in that city which took part in the official welcome for Lord Moira (1754-1826), also a freemason, on his arrival there (1813) as the new Governor-General of India. Chinnery's masonic career is otherwise little documented, and its connection with his artistic output unexplored.
Some of his most famous paintings are of the Indian family of Colonel James Achilles Kirkpatrick British Resident to the Nizam of Hyderabad who had set up home, to some scandal among his fellow Europeans, with the Indo-Iranian great niece of the Nizam of Hyderabad's chief minister. He painted "The Kirkpatrick Children" presenting them " a sympathy that is rare in portraiture of the period; the boy looking straight at the viewer with a self-conscious stance, hand on hip, while the girl looks uncomfortably at the floor." Mounting debt prompted a move in 1825 to southern China.
From 1825 until his death in 1852 Chinnery based himself in Macau, but until 1832 he made regular visits to Canton (now Guangzhou). He painted portraits of Chinese and Western merchants, visiting sea-captains, and their families resident in Macau. His work in oil paint was closely imitated by the Cantonese artist Lam Qua, who himself became a renowned portrait painter. Chinnery also painted landscapes (both in oils and in watercolours), and made numerous drawings of the people of Macau engaged in their daily activities. 
In 1846 he made a six-month visit to Hong Kong, where he suffered from ill health but made detailed studies of the newly founded colony. He died in Macau on May 30 1852 and is buried in the Old Protestant Cemetery there.
Works.
Other than artistic value, his paintings are historically valuable as he was the only western painter resident in South China between the early and mid 19th century. He vividly depicted the life of ordinary people and the landscape of the Pearl River Delta at that period. Among the subjects of his portraits are the Scottish opium traders William Jardine and James Matheson as well as the diarist Harriet Low.
George Chinnery learnt the Gurney system shorthand from his father and grandfather (both writing-masters), and he used his own modified version of this shorthand for jotting quick notes on his pencil sketches.
Legacy.
Substantial collections of Chinnery's drawings are to be found in London in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum; and in Salem, Mass., at the Peabody Essex Museum. Other notable groups are held in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, UK; the Hong Kong Museum of Art; the Macau Museum; and the Macau Museum of Art. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation can claim to have the outstanding corporate collection of Chinnery's works. Loan exhibitions of his pictures have been held recently in Centro Cultural de Belém, Lisbon (1995); Metropolitan Teien Art Museum, Tokyo (1996); Hong Kong Museum of History, Hong Kong (2005); and Macau Museum (2010).

Bill Jenkings

William Charles Jenkings (1915–1996) was an Australian writer, newspaper reporter and well known Bondi Beach identity.
Jenkings was a news and crime reporter for the Sydney newspaper "The Daily Mirror", joining the paper in 1944. The Daily Mirror was then owned by Ezra Norton and was later owned by Rupert Murdoch's "News Ltd." Jenkings worked as reporter for the Daily Mirror until his retirement in 1991 - a remarkable career that spanned 47 years. He covered high-profile cases during the 1950s and 1960s, including the Graeme Thorne kidnapping, the Bogle-Chandler case, and the Wanda Beach murders. One of his sources was Detective Ray "Gunner" Kelly, who benefited from the publicity, becoming one of Australia's best-known policemen.
Jenkings published two books. "Crime Reporter" was a pulp-paperback about some of his highest-profile reporting cases. "As Crime Goes By..", his life story, which was mostly ghost-written for him just after he retired, became a best-seller. The book featured interesting accounts of the lives of many famous Sydney criminals such as Kate Leigh, Tilly Devine, John Frederick "Chow" Hayes, William "Joey" Hollebone, Nellie Cameron, "Pretty" Dulcie Markham, Robert "Pretty Boy" Walker, Richard "Dick" Reilly, "Greyhound" Charlie Bourke, Stewart John Regan and Darcy Dugan. In it he suggested that he knew the solutions to the Bogle-Chandler and Wanda Beach cases, although the suspect he named for the latter commenced legal action against Jenkings for the allegation. This litigation was not finalized, and it ceased with Jenkings' death.
Jenkings was also unabashed at his support for several of the men he'd met in his working life. He had known Rupert Murdoch when Murdoch ran the Daily Mirror, and Jenkings insisted that he was a great boss. He also refused to believe allegations about the involvement of Sydney policemen Ray "Gunner" Kelly, Fred Krahe and Frank Farrell in corrupt activities, saying that he had known them personally.
Bill Jenkings married "Noreen Cecilia Simpson" at St.Anne's Catholic Church, Bondi, New South Wales, on 30 March 1940. He lived with his family for most of his life in Bondi Beach, New South Wales. Gifted with a sharp mind, Jenkings made and maintained legendary contacts both in the underworld and the police force. He was regarded as the foremost crime reporter in Sydney for over 50 years.
He was known to many people as " "Bondi" Bill Jenkings", and was a Life member of the "Bondi "Surf Lifesaving Club.
Bill Jenkings died on 12 May 1996. He was later cremated at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park at Botany.
He was survived by his wife and four children.

Environmental journalism

Environmental journalism is the collection, verification, production, distribution and exhibition of information regarding current events, trends, issues and people that are associated with the non-human world with which humans necessarily interact. To be an environmental journalist, one must have an understanding of scientific language and practice, knowledge of historical environmental events, the ability to keep abreast of environmental policy decisions and the work of environmental organizations, a general understanding of current environmental concerns, and the ability to communicate all of that information to the public in such a way that it can be easily understood, despite its complexity.
Environmental journalism falls within the scope of environmental communication, and its roots can be traced to nature writing. One key controversy in environmental journalism is a continuing disagreement over how to distinguish it from its allied genres and disciplines.
History.
While the practice of nature writing has a rich history that dates back at least as far as the exploration narratives of Christopher Columbus, and follows tradition up through prominent nature writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau in the late 19th century, John Burroughs and John Muir in the early 20th century, and Aldo Leopold in the 1940s, the field of environmental journalism did not begin to take shape until the 1960s and 1970s.
The growth of environmental journalism as a profession roughly parallels that of the environmental movement, which became a mainstream cultural movement with the publication of Rachel Carson’s "Silent Spring" in 1962 and was further legitimized by the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. Grassroots environmental organizations made a booming appearance on the political scene in the 1960s and 1970s, raising public awareness of what many considered to be the “environmental crisis”, and working to influence environmental policy decisions. The mass media has followed and generated public interest on environmental issues ever since.
The field of environmental journalism was further legitimized by the creation of the Society of Environmental Journalists [http://www.sej.org] in 1990, whose mission “is to advance public understanding of environmental issues by improving the quality, accuracy, and visibility of environmental reporting.” Today, academic programs are offered at a number of institutions to train budding journalists in the rigors, complexity and sheer breadth of environmental journalism.
Advocacy debate.
There exists a minor rift in the community of environmental journalists. Some, including those in the Society of Environmental Journalists, believe in objectively reporting environmental news, while others, like Michael Frome, a prominent figure in the field, believe that journalists should only enter the environmental side of the field if saving the planet is a personal passion, and that environmental journalists should not shy away from environmental advocacy, though not at the expense of clearly relating facts and opinions on all sides of an issue. This debate is not likely to be settled soon, but with changes in the field of journalism filtering up from new media being used by the general public to produce news, it seems likely that the field of environmental journalism will lend itself more and more toward reporting points of view akin to environmental advocacy.
Genres.
Environmental communication is all of the forms of communication that are engaged with the social debate about environmental issues and problems.
Also within the scope of environmental communication are the genres of nature writing, science writing, environmental literature, environmental interpretation and environmental advocacy. While there is a great deal of overlap among the various genres within environmental communication, they are each deserving of their own definition.
Nature writing.
Nature writing is the genre with the longest history in environmental communication. In his book, "This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing", Thomas J. Lyon attempts to use a “taxonomy of nature writing” in order to define the genre. He suggests that his classifications, too, suffer a great deal of overlap and intergrading. “The literature of nature has three main dimensions to it: natural history information, personal responses to nature, and philosophical interpretation of nature” (Lyon 20). In the natural history essay, “the main burden of the writing is to convey pointed instruction in the facts of nature,” such as with the ramble-type nature writing of John Burroughs (Lyon 21). “In essays of experience, the author’s firsthand contact with nature is the frame for the writing,” as with Edward Abbey’s contemplation of a desert sunset (Lyon 23). In the philosophical interpretation of nature, the content is similar to that of the natural history and personal experience essays, “but the mode of presentation tends to be more abstract and scholarly” (Lyon 25). "The Norton Book of Nature Writing" adds a few new dimensions to the genre of nature writing, including animal narratives, garden essays, farming essays, ecofeminist works, writing on environmental justice, and works advocating environmental preservation, sustainability and biological diversity. Environmental journalism pulls from the tradition and scope of nature writing.
Science writing.
Science writing is writing that focuses specifically on topics of scientific study, generally translating jargon that is difficult for those outside a particular scientific field to understand into language that is easily digestible. This genre can be narrative or informative. Not all science writing falls within the bounds of environmental communication, only science writing that takes on topics relevant to the environment. Environmental journalism also pulls from the tradition and scope of science writing.
Environmental interpretation.
Environmental interpretation is a particular format for the communication of relevant information. It “involves translating the technical language of a natural science or related field into terms and ideas that people who aren’t scientists can readily understand. And it involves doing it in a way that’s entertaining and interesting to these people” (Ham 3). Environmental interpretation is pleasurable (to engage an audience in the topic and inspire them to learn more about it), relevant (meaningful and personal to the audience so that they have an intrinsic reason to learn more about the topic), organized (easy to follow and structured so that main points are likely to be remembered) and thematic (the information is related to a specific, repetitious message) (Ham 8–28). While environmental journalism is not derived from environmental interpretation, it can employ interpretive techniques to explain difficult concepts to its audience.
Environmental literature.
Environmental literature is writing that comments intelligently on environmental themes, particularly as applied to the relationships between man, society and the environment. Most nature writing and some science writing falls within the scope of environmental literature. Often, environmental literature is understood to espouse care and concern for the environment, thus advocating a more thoughtful and ecologically sensitive relationship of man to nature. Environmental journalism is partially derived from environmental literature
Environmental advocacy.
Environmental advocacy is presenting information on nature and environmental issues that is decidedly opinionated and encourages its audience to adopt more environmentally sensitive attitudes, often more biocentric worldviews. Environmental advocacy can be present in any of the aforementioned genres of environmental communication. It is currently debated whether environmental journalism should employ techniques of environmental advocacy.
Topics.
The field of environmental journalism covers a wide variety of topics. According to "The Reporter’s Environmental Handbook", environmental journalists perceive water concerns as the most important environmental issue, followed by atmospheric air pollution concerns, endocrine disruptors, and waste management issues. The journalists surveyed were more likely to prioritize specific, local environmental issues than global environmental concerns.
Environmental journalism can include, but is not limited to, some of the following topics:

Jatayu

In the Indian epic "Ramayana", Jatayu (Sanskrit: जटायुः "Jatāyu", Tamil: "Chatayu", Thai: "Sadayu", Malay: "Jentayu" or "Chentayu", Indonesian: "Burung Jatayu" meaning "Jatayu bird") is the son of Aruṇa and nephew of Garuda. A demi-god who has the form of a vulture, he was an old friend of Dasharatha (Rama's father). He tries to rescue Sita from Ravana when Ravana is on his way to Lanka after kidnapping Sita. Jatayu fought valiantly with Ravana, but as Jatayu was very old Ravana soon got the better of him. As Rama and Lakshmana chanced upon the stricken and dying Jatayu in their search for Sita, he informs them of the fight between him and Ravana and the direction in which Ravana had gone (i.e., south).
Jatayu and his brother Sampati, when young, used to compete as to who could fly higher. On one such instance Jatayu flew so high that he was about to get seared by the sun's flames. Sampati saved his brother by spreading his own wings and thus shielding Jatayu from the hot flames. In the process, Sampati himself got injured and lost his wings. As a result, Sampati lived wingless for the rest of his life. 
While Jatayu was wounded and lying on the ground when Lord Rama arrived, Lord Rama sensed the end result and decided that Jatayu get moksha. Lord Rama hit an arrow in the ground so as to call all seven sacred rivers, called teertha. Six rivers' waters arrived, one river water failing to obey Lord Rama's call. Since Lord Rama was himself an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, He forced the Gaya teertha to arrive at the spot. 
According to legend, Lepakshi is the place where Jatayu fell after being wounded by Ravana, and Ramarkal Mettu is the place where the last rites were performed. Rama is said to have commanded the bird to rise "Le Pakshi", and hence the name for that town.

Masaki Sumitani

Early life.
Masaki Sumitani was born December 18, 1975 in Harima, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. After graduating from Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Higashi High School, he entered Doshisha University and majored in Commerce.
Professional wrestling career.
While at college he picked up wrestling as a hobby and soon joined the Doshisha Professional Wrestling Alliance (DWA). Under his performing name "GiveUp Sumitani", he won the heavy class Kyoto pro-wrestling championship co-hosted by DWA and the Ritsumeikan Wrestling Alliance (RWA) of nearby Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. Former IWGP Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi and fellow comedian Makoto Izubuchi were also participant of these events.
Sumitani continued his wrestling aspirations in late 2005, working in the comedically off-beat HUSTLE promotion and defeating Yinling the Erotic Terrorist in his debut match; he has since gone to team with Naoya Ogawa and Yoshihiro Tajiri in leading the HUSTLE Army against Generalissimo Takada’s Monster Army.
In early 2006, he started working with manzai partner Izubuchi again, with Izubuchi taking the name Razor Ramon RG ("RG" meaning "Real Gay"). Izubuchi’s character was not nearly as well received as Sumitani’s, but is still an active wrestler in HUSTLE, recently teaming up with The Great Muta. Sumitani's character is that of an underdog face that has a never say die attitude and uses his quickness to defeat his larger opponents. "Daily Sports" in Japan reported that Razor Ramon HG retired from pro wrestling after Hustle Mania, which took place November 23, 2006 at Yokohama Arena with Sumitani being defeated by The Esperanza. However, as with most retirements in wrestling, Sumitani returned to action, wrestling at Hustle 21 on March 18 and Hustle 22 on April 21.
Hard Gay rose up to become one of the top faces of the HUSTLE promotion, but his wrestling career came to an abrupt end in July 2009 when he shattered his left foot while diving from the ring during an event at Korakuen Hall. He needed 12 bolts to put his foot back together. Upon his recovery, he hoped to return to TV comedy.
Comedy.
It was through wrestling in their college years, that Sumitani met Makoto Izubuchi, with whom he would later form the comedy duo "Razor Ramon", the name inspired by the character portrayed by professional wrestler Scott Hall, in 1997. During their college years, Razor Ramon won the Fukuwarai award in the Imamiya Kids’ Ebisu Manzai Contest and gained experience on the stage through the audition live performance SABUKI at 2chome-gekijo, an Osaka comedy club opened by the Yoshimoto Kogyo comedy troupe at which many comedians from the Kansai area start their career.
After completing his degree at the prestigious Doshisha University, Sumitani got a job at CO-OP KOBE, as a grocery delivery man. His desire to pursue a career as a professional comedian led him to quit his job after four months, when he joined Yoshimoto Kogyo with his partner Makoto Izubuchi. Razor Ramon made their TV debut in 1999 and won the Judges Special Award in the ABC Owarai (Comedy) Grand-Prix in 2000. Both Sumitani and Izubuchi joined the Yoshimoto Kogyo-produced program Yoshimoto Shin-kigeki in 2001, often playing yakuza, salaryman, udon restaurant owners, construction workers, and others.
Hard Gay.
A character (introduced in 2002) developed and portrayed by Sumitani is . The term "Hādo Gei" is a Japanese reference to American gay subculture in similar fashion to, say, "punk". In Japan, gender subculture with distinct dress style are in fact transgender or drag, which in Japan is referred to as "Gei ゲイ". In turn, the term "hard gay" became the reference to more masculine oriented "drag" seen to be prevalent in America. The fact that Hard Gay does not portray any Japanese gay subculture also explains why the sketch was allowed to be aired on Japanese TV, which has its own code of political correctness.
The official name is Razor Ramon HG. Dressing in a tight black PVC gay fetish outfit, he performed acts of charity ("yonaoshi", “social improvement”) for unsuspecting bystanders while performing trademark pelvic thrusts and vocalizations, often accompanied by "Livin' la Vida Loca" by Ricky Martin.
According to some accounts the name "Hard Gay" was the suggestion of Sumitani’s senior comedian in the Yoshimoto Kogyo group, Kendo Kobayashi, in reference to his hard dancing. The name has also been described as a pun on 芸, "gei", which means "skill" or "art." However, to develop his character, Sumitani visited gay bars in Doyama-cho, Osaka’s biggest gay area, and his costume, which consists of hot pants, a small vest, and cap, all in black PVC, along with aviator sunglasses, was purchased at a shop called VFTQ in Minami-Horie, Osaka, which specializes in gay fashion. Hard Gay makes regular use of a number of catchphrases in his act; he usually makes his entrance in front of the camera shouting ""Dōmō Haadogei desu"" ("Hello, it's Hard Gay"), with arms thrust out and a spin afterwards. His self-introduction is then followed by his dance moves. He often shouts ""Hoooooo"" (フゥ～!) or ""Foohhhh!"" (フォー！), a running joke in his performances. He often stops people saying unfavorable things to him by shouting ""Sei sei sei sei sei"" with his palm in front of the person’s face. Whether this means anything is debatable, although Sumitani has commented that ""sei sei"" is something that comes out from his mouth when he is not happy, and that he does not mean "" as in to speak something, although one might compare this action to the "talk to the hand" gesture. A possible interpretation might be that the origin lies in the word "urusai" (lit. "noisy," meaning "Be quiet!"), which is often pronounced "urusē" うるせー in Kansai dialect, shortened to "sei". Another theory is the word "sei" written by kanji 静, meaning "quiet." Also, "sei" 性, means "sex" or "gender" in Japanese.
Sumitani’s supposed homosexuality was exposed as a gimmick when he was caught in the midst of a date, with Japanese actress and swimsuit model Anna Suzuki whom he has since married. He has been criticised for his stereotypical depiction of gay men and for building a career on using bizarre and extreme antics to "parody" a social minority. A spokesperson for the Hokkaido Sexual Minority Association Sapporo Meeting, a support group for gay, lesbian and transgender people, has said: "Hard Gay’s acceptance by the Japanese public shows me that there is a strong tendency here to see homosexuality as something to be laughed at. That is sad."
He then announced that he would start to reappear on television as Masaki Sumitani instead of Razor Ramon HG. His first reappearance as Masaki Sumitani was April 18, 2008 in a theatrical production of the jidaigeki take, "HAKANA" 
Prior to his transition back to television comedy, Sumitani revealed that during his hiatus between his career ending wrestling injury and his impending TV return that he has fallen on hard times and has been making the equivalent of $70 USD a month. He is planning to reinvent himself because he does not want to go down in Japanese television history as a "one hit wonder". Whether this entails a new "neta" (comic hook) for his HG character or a brand new character altogether for Sumitani remains to be seen.
Sumitani once reprised his role as Hard Gay for a teaser for the video game, Devil's Third. Unlike his early appearances, he wears a suit but retains his signature cap and glasses.
Other media.
Razor Ramon HG made a small cameo in the May 2006 chapter of "Gantz" (chapter 233), shown on a television in Kurono Kei’s apartment. He also made a small cameo in episode 12 of "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya", at 2:29, with Akihiro Miwa. A picture of him is shown in Ğ. In addition, a reference to Razor Ramon HG is made in Chapter 2 of the manga "Asu no Yoichi", with a character attempting to silence someone much like HG would with "Sei!"
Sumitani released his first single entitled "Young Man" on 8 February 2006, which is a Japanese rendition of the Village People’s song "YMCA."
He has also appeared in several television programs. HG (as himself) portrayed a gym teacher in the high school episode of the "batsu" game series from the Japanese variety show "Gaki no Tsukai". He also did a cameo on the set of "Hana Yori Dango". Razor Ramon was a contestant on "", even making it to the final and finished in 2nd place. He was featured on "The Soup"’s "Souper Fantastic Ultra Wish Time." He was featured on "Lost in Tokyo", a Dutch and Flemish game show. He has also appeared in multiple episodes of Jonathan Ross' "Japanorama" on the BBC. In May 2009, He made an appearance in the comical Drama, "Atashinchi no Danshi", where his character was in love with one of the male characters named Fuu. There were repeated shoots of his catch phrase "Fuuuu!" while he walked round the family house in search of Fuu.
Hard Gay, dressed differently, makes a cameo as a construction worker in the game "Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland". After he fixes one of the bridges for Tingle, he proceeds to do his trademark pelvic thrusts while a smooth jazz style song plays in the background.
Seeking to shed his former image and strike out on his own, he's turned to modeling. He is now the new male face for boots retailer Luan. 
Personal life.
The registration of his marriage to Anna Suzuki was announced on August 10, 2006. Suzuki has stated she will end her modeling career after her commitments are finished and concentrate on starting a family. The two officially became married on November 27, 2006, only four days after his supposed retirement. The couple had their first child in 2008.

Gokula

Gokula or Gokul Singh (died 1670 AD) was a Jat chieftain of Sinsini village in Bharatpur district in Rajasthan, India. Later, he became a chieftain of Tilpat in Haryana. His father's name was Madu. Madu had four sons namely, Sindhuraj, Ola, Jhaman and Saman. The second son Ola later became famous as Gokula. Gokula provided leadership to the Jat peasants who challenged the Imperial power. Gokula inspired the Jats to fight the Mughals.
The first serious outbreak of anti-imperial reaction took place among the Jats of Mathura district Uttar Pradesh, where the imperial faujdar, Abdun-Nabi, had oppressed them greatly. In 1669 the Jat peasantry rose under a leader, Gokula, zamindar of Tilpat, killed the faujdar, but the freedom of the district could not be maintained for more than a year, and they were suppressed by Hasan Ali Khan, the new faujdar of Mathura aided personally by Mughal tyrant Aurangzeb. Gokula was put to death.
Gokula left Sinsini.
Around 1650-51, Madu and his uncle Singha had fought against the Rajput Raja Jai Singh backed by Mughal support in which Sindhuraj died and second son of Madu Ola became the successor. After this war Singha along with other Jat families in the fortress 'Girsa' moved to Mahavan beyond River Yamuna. Ola (Gokula) also moved with Singha to this place.
Rise of Gokula.
Gokula came on the scene when the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb attempted to convert Dar-ul-Hurb (Hindustan) to Dar-ul-Islam forcibly through persecution and dogmatic policies. The 1669 Jat uprising in India under Gokula occurred at a time when the Mughal government was by no means weak. This period of Aurangzeb’s reign witnessed the climax of the Mughal Empire. During the early medieval period frequent breakdown of law and order often induced the Jats to adopt a refractory course. But with the establishment of Mughal rule, law and order was effectively established and there were no major Jat revolts during the century and a half preceding the reign of Aurangzeb, though in 1638 Murshid Quli Khan, the Mughal faujdar of Mathura, was killed during an operation against Jats. During the reign of Aurangzeb, the faujdar of Mathura in 1669 was Abdunnabi, who incurred the wrath of the people.
In early 1669, Aurangzeb appointed a strong follower of Islam, Abdunnabi, as faujdar of Mathura to curb the Hindus of this area. Abdunnabi established a cantonment near Gokul Singh and conducted all his operations from there. Gokula organized the farmers not to give taxes to the Mughals. The Mughal soldiers retaliated, beginning the struggle of the farmers. Meanwhile Aurangzeb issued orders on 9 April 1669 to abolish the Hindu temples. As a result, a large number of Hindu temples and ancient heritages from the period of Kushans were damaged. During May 1669 the faujdar Abdunnabi seized the village Sihora. Gokula was there and there was a fight in which Abdunnabi was killed. Gokula and his fellow farmers moved further, attacked and destroyed the Sadabad cantonment. Sadullakhan had founded Sadabad during the period of Shahjahan. This incidence inspired the Hindus to fight against the Mughal rulers. The fights continued for five months.
Rebellion.
In 1669 the Jats rebelled under the leadership of Gokula. Although dominated and led by Jats, the rebel forces included other local communities such as the Mev, Meena, Ahir, Gujjar, Naruka, and Panwar. The rebels gathered at the village of Sahora (about 6 miles from Mathura). Abdun Nabi, the faujdar of Mathura, attacked them. At first he appeared to be gaining ground, but in the middle of the fighting he was killed on 12 May 1669.
The turbulence spread to Agra district also whereto Radandaz Khan was sent (13 May – 22nd Zil-Hijja) with a force to put down the rebels. Aurangazeb appointed Saf Shikan Khan as the new faujdar of Mathura. As arms failed to prevail, diplomacy was resorted to. The Mughal government offered to forgive Gokula provided he surrendered his spoils. But Gukula spurned the offer. On the other side, as the situation was assuming serious proportions, the Emperor had to proceed (28 November 1669) in person to the Disturbed area. On his way on 4 December 1669 (20th Rajab) Aurangazeb learnt of the circumstance of rebellion in the villages of Rewara, Chandarakanta and Sarkhud. He dispatched Hasan Ali Khan to attack these places. Till noon the insurgents fought with bows and muskets. Getting desperate thereafter, many of them having performed the jauhar of their women fell upon the Khan, A fierce fight raged till the evening in which many imperialists and 300 rebels were killed. Hasan Ali Khan returned to the Emperor, taking 250 male and female prisoners. Aurangazeb was pleased with his performance. He made him the faujdar of Mathura in place of Saf Shikan Khan who had obviously failed in suppressing the rebels.
Under Hasan Ali Khan, were placed 2,000 barqandaztroops 1000 archers 1000 musketeers 1,000 rocketmen, and 25 pieces of cannons. Amanulla, the faujdar of the environs of Agra, was also ordered to help Hasan Ali. The latter immediately got engaged in quelling the rebellion.
Battle of Tilpat.
Gokula, with 20,000 followers, rushed forward to face the imperialists 20 miles from Tilpat. Both sides suffered many casualties but the rebels could not cope with the trained Mughals and their artillery. They retreated to Tilpat, where Hasan Ali followed and besieged them. Fighting continued for three days in which muskets and bows were used by the contestants. On the fourth day, the royalists charged the besieged from all sides and having made a breach in the walls entered Tilpat. Then ensued a bloody conflict. The experienced Mughals won the day but not before losing 4000 men. Of the vanquished, 5000 lay dead, while 7000 were arrested.
Aurangzeb marched on November 28, 1669 from Delhi to curb the Jat threat. The Mughals under Hasan Alikhan and Brahmdev Sisodia attacked Gokula Jat.
Death.
Gokula and his two associates were captured alive through the efforts of Shaikh Razi-ud-Din, the peshkar of Hassan Ali. They and other prisoners were presented to the Emperor. Being furious, he ordered Gokula and Uday Singh to be hacked to death at Agra Kotwali on 1 January 1670. Other captives either met fate of their leader or were put in chains.

Beverly Clock

The Beverly Clock is a clock situated in the 3rd floor lift foyer of the Department of Physics at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. The clock is still running despite never having been manually wound since its construction in 1864 by Arthur Beverly.
Operation.
The clock's mechanism is driven by variations in atmospheric pressure, and by daily temperature variations; of the two, temperature variations are more important. Either causes the air in a one cubic-foot (28 liter) air-tight box to expand or contract, which pushes on a diaphragm. A temperature variation of six degree Fahrenheit (3.3 °C) over the course of each day creates approximately enough pressure to raise a one-pound weight by one inch (1.1 Newtons of force), which drives the clock mechanism.
A similar clock mechanism operating on the same principle is known as the Atmos clock.
While the clock has not been wound since it was made by Arthur Beverly in 1864, it has stopped on a number of occasions, such as when its mechanism needed cleaning or there was a mechanical failure, and when the Physics Department moved to new quarters. As well, on occasions when the ambient temperature has not fluctuated sufficiently to absorb the requisite amount of energy, the clock will not function. However, after environmental parameters readjust, the clock begins operating again.

The Entertainer (film)

The Entertainer is a 1960 drama film directed by Tony Richardson, based on the stage play of the same name by John Osborne. It starred Laurence Olivier as a failing third-rate music-hall stage performer who tries to keep his career going even as the music-hall tradition fades into history and his personal life falls apart.
The film was adapted by Osborne and Nigel Kneale from Osborne's play, and was produced by Harry Saltzman. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Olivier). It was filmed on location in the Lancashire seaside town of Morecambe.
Plot.
Jean Rice, a young London art teacher, travels to a seaside resort (not specified but partly filmed in Morecambe) to visit her family. She is emotionally confused, having had a row with her fiancé, who wants her to emigrate with him to Africa. She is also deeply concerned about the Suez Crisis, having seen her soldier brother off to the war. She has attended a peace rally in Trafalgar Square, directed against prime minister Anthony Eden.
She finds that the resort has declined from its pre-World War II heyday and is now drawing waning crowds, despite being in mid-season. The music-hall act of her father Archie Rice (Olivier) plays out to a small number of increasingly uninterested spectators. Her family is deeply dysfunctional. Her beloved grandfather, once one of the leading stars of the music hall, lives in quiet retirement with his daughter-in-law and grandson.
Jean goes to the theatre where her father is playing. As well as being an undischarged bankrupt and a semi-alcoholic, he is desperately short of money and is hounded by creditors – the income-tax people as well as his unpaid cast. He is adored by his cynical son and watched with mild amusement by his father; but his relationship with Phoebe, his second wife, is strained. He is a womaniser and she is well aware of his tendencies, openly commenting on them to the rest of the family. She is often found drinking heavily.
With his latest show drawing to a close, Archie is desperate to secure a new show for the winter season. While acting as master of ceremonies at a Miss Great Britain beauty contest he charms the young woman who finished in second place. Soon he is conducting an affair with her. Her wealthy and ambitious parents want her to have an entertainment career and are willing to put up the money for Archie's new show, if it includes her. They shake hands on the deal.
While this is going on, the radio reports that Archie's son Mick has been captured by the Egyptians at Suez after a major firefight. Archie seems oblivious of the news and the distress of his family. He is fixated with his dream of restarting his stalled career and his affair. His daughter discovers the affair and tells her grandfather. He, acting out of what he believes are his son's best interests, goes to the girl's parents and tells them that Archie is already married and a bankrupt. They swiftly break off all connections with him, ending their financing for his next show.
While he is still digesting this turn of events, news arrives that Archie's son has been killed in Egypt. His body is returned and a civic commemoration is attended by the whole town. It is reported that he will be awarded a Victoria Cross for his actions. Archie is still too busy fixating on his career to notice how his family is falling apart at the news. His brother-in-law wants to help the family to relocate to Canada and help him run a hotel but Archie rebuffs him. Instead he persuades an impresario to promote a new show, with his father as the headline attraction. His father, despite his age is still extremely popular and there is a public demand for his return.
On the opening night his father collapses and dies, completing the estrangement of the family. His wife and son are determined to go to Canada, while Archie is set on staying in Britain, even if it means going to jail. The film ends with Archie making an apparently final performance to an apathetic audience.
Cast.

Stephen Graham Jones

Stephen Graham Jones is a Blackfeet Native American author of experimental fiction, horror fiction, crime fiction, and science fiction. He shares a fan base with fellow authors Will Christopher Baer and Craig Clevenger known as The Velvet. 
Biography.
Stephen Graham Jones is the author of 10 novels, 2 collections, 1 novella, and countless short stories. Stephen has been a Shirley Jackson Award finalist three times, a Bram Stoker Award finalist, a Black Quill Award finalist, an International Horror Guild finalist, a Colorado Book Award Finalist, a Texas Monthly Book Selection, and has won the Texas Institute of Letters Award for Fiction and the Independent Publishers Award for Multicultural Fiction. He's also been a Texas Writers League Fellow and an NEA fellow in fiction. His short fiction has been in Cemetery Dance, Asimov's, Weird Tales, The Magazine of Bizarro Fiction, etc., as well as all the journals: Open City, Black Warrior Review, Alaska Quarterly Review, Literal Latte, Cutbank, and on and on, some hundred and thirty stories, total, through every letter of the alphabet.
Though Blackfeet, Stephen was born in 1972 in West Texas. This is often confusing, as most Blackfeet are in Montana and he grew up working from tractors and horses and in all kinds of welding and automotive shops. There was also lots of hunting and basketball and various scrapes with the law. After getting his PhD from Florida State University in a record two years, Stephen, twenty-eight then, went to work in the warehouse at Sear's (all he ever planned), but injuries forced him into teaching. And it's not a bad life, being a professor. Stephen made full professor at thirty-six--likely the youngest full prof in the humanities at The University of Colorado at Boulder (and maybe all of Colorado) and is into fiction, comics, film, screenwriting, and anything horror or fantasy, western or science fiction. Or, just anything that tells an interesting story in an interesting way.

Steven Sweet

Steven Sweet (born "Steven Chamberlin" on October 29, 1965 in Wadsworth, Ohio, USA) is a Los Angeles-based drummer who is most famous for being a member of Warrant.
Personal information.
Before joining Warrant he was in the glam metal band Plain Jane with Jani Lane. He lives with his wife Beth, a graduate of the Carnegie Mellon drama program and a musical artist in her own right. In addition to touring with the band Warrant, Steven divides his time between studio session work, songwriting and portrait painting. He has a daughter. Steven has his own business: painting portraits of pets.
Steven grew up playing the drums and whatever instruments were available in the household. The second son in a family of three multi-talented boys, Steven showed artistic talent from an early age, creating illustrations, paintings and gifts. He also displayed an ability to mimic the styles of his favorite drummers. Along with this ability came a remarkable vocal range. At age 15 he was performing the music of Rush, Van Halen, AC/DC and many others in bar bands with his brother, David (a studio owner and musical producer based out of the Los Angeles area.) Steven designed logos, album artwork and marketing materials while still in his teens.
Warrant.
Steven Sweet replaced original Warrant drummer Max Asher. He joined the band with lead singer and songwriter, Jani Lane (John Oswald) both of whom were born and raised near Cleveland, Ohio (specifically, the Akron area). After touring the club circuit in southern Florida in separate bands, Steven and Jani moved to the Los Angeles area. Steven, along with Jani were signed to the Columbia record label within two years of their arrival and subsequent collaboration with Erik Turner and Jerry Dixon of Warrant. Steven played the driving rhythms and sang backup vocals on the album "Dirty, Rotten, Filthy, Stinkin Rich" which quickly sold 500,000 units thus making it a certifiable "Gold Record." The album produced a number two hit on the Billboard Top 40, a ballad entitled "Heaven". Only the duo Milli Vanilli stood between Warrant and a number one hit. The band toured heavily, pushing the album into Platinum and quickly followed up with a second album, "Cherry Pie" which also went Platinum.
The band's videos were iconic, particularly "Cherry Pie" which featured a young blonde beauty serving up homemade pie in back of a cherry red convertible. Steven participated in the recording and video performance of a collaborative single, along with stars of television, screen, and the Billboard charts - the proceeds of which benefitted AIDs research. The video captured the kind of energy evident in the previously released, "We Are The World" single. Steven can also be seen mugging for the camera on the band's own concert video which features videos, back-stage footage, interviews and a sample of the road trip that was Steven's life during the early years.
Warrant's sudden success and notoriety played havoc with the personal lives of its members. Steven experienced sudden prosperity and was soon living in the Hollywood Hills, visiting his home whenever there was a break in the touring schedule. Fortunes changed however with the commercial disappointment of Warrant's third release, "Dog Eat Dog", despite the fact that the album was the band's most mature effort to date. Jani Lane was responsible for a couple of masterpiece tracks and the band never sounded so tight.
After Warrant's third studio album with Columbia, "Dog Eat Dog", Steven Sweet was excluded from further touring with the band amidst the walkout of singer Jani Lane. With Joey Allen's departure soon after, the band members were not on good terms, though each continued to record on other projects. Steven and Joey remained good friends during the following decade.
Steven has since rejoined the new lineup of Warrant, consisting of all the original members, other than Jani Lane. Robert Mason, ex Lynch Mob vocalist has taken over vocal duties. Current lineup consists of Robert Mason, Joey Allen, Erik Turner, Jerry Dixon, and Steven. In 2008, the Steven and Warrant announced a summer amphitheater tour with Cinderella and (George Lynch's) Lynch Mob.
Steven continues to record his own compositions when not touring. His vocal style is multifaceted, ranging from heavy rock, to soulful blues and R&B.

The Entertainer (rag)

"The Entertainer" is a 1902 classic piano rag written by Scott Joplin.
One of the classics of ragtime, it returned to top international prominence as part of the ragtime revival in the 1970s, when it was used as the theme music for the 1973 Oscar-winning film "The Sting". Composer and pianist Marvin Hamlisch's adaptation reached #3 on the "Billboard" pop chart and spent a week at #1 on the easy listening chart in 1974. "The Sting" was set in the 1930s, a full generation after the end of ragtime's mainstream popularity, thus giving the mistaken impression that ragtime music was popular at that time.
The Recording Industry Association of America ranked it #10 on its "Songs of the Century" list.
Music.
"The Entertainer" is sub-titled "A Rag Time Two Step", which was a form of dance popular until about 1911, and a style which was common among rags written at the time.
Its structure is: Intro AA BB A CC Intro2 DD.
It is primarily set in the key of C Major; however, for the C section (commonly referred to as the 'Trio'), it modulates to the subdominant, F Major, then through a transitional passage modulates back to C Major for the D section. The "B" section contains an indication that the melody is to be played an octave higher on the repeat.
In the June 7, 1903 "St. Louis Globe-Democrat", contemporary composer Monroe H. Rosenfeld described "The Entertainer" as "the best and most euphonious" of Joplin's compositions to that point. "It is a jingling work of a very original character, embracing various strains of a retentive character which set the foot in spontaneous action and leave an indelible imprint on the tympanum."
Suggested by the rag's dedication to "James Brown and his Mandolin Club", author Rudi Blesh wrote that "some of the melodies recall the pluckings and the fast tremolos of the little steel-stringed plectrum instruments..." In fact, Stark issued an arrangement of the piece for two mandolins and a guitar.
Publication history.
The copyright on "The Entertainer" was registered December 29, 1902, along with two other Joplin rags, "A Breeze from Alabama" and "Elite Syncopations", all three of which were published by John Stark & Son of St. Louis, Missouri. The centerpiece of the original cover art featured a minstrel show caricature of a black man in formal attire on a theater stage.
"The Entertainer" also appeared in orchestration as part of "The Red Back Book" of "Standard High Class Rags" popular with ragtime bands.
Popularity and legacy.
In November 1970, Joshua Rifkin released a recording called "" on the classical label Nonesuch, which featured as its second track "The Entertainer". It sold 100,000 copies in its first year and eventually became Nonesuch's first million-selling record. The Billboard "Best-Selling Classical LPs" chart for September 28, 1974 has the record at #5, with the follow-up "Volume 2" at #4, and a combined set of both volumes at #3. Separately both volumes had been on the chart for 64 weeks. The album was nominated in 1971 for two Grammy Award categories, Best Album Notes and Best Instrumental Soloist Performance (without orchestra), but at the ceremony on March 14, 1972, Rifkin did not win in any category. In 1979 Alan Rich in the "New York Magazine" wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin's music on disk, Nonesuch Records "created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival."
Marvin Hamlisch lightly adapted and orchestrated Joplin's music for the 1973 film "The Sting", for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation on April 2, 1974. His version of "The Entertainer" reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the American Top 40 music chart on May 18, 1974, prompting the "New York Times" to write, "the whole nation has begun to take notice." Thanks to the film and its score, Joplin's work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music worlds, becoming (in the words of music magazine "Record World"), the "classical phenomenon of the decade."
In the United States, "The Entertainer" is one of many songs commonly played by ice cream trucks, in order to attract attention.

It was first published in March 1999 and is produced four times a year. "Mslexia" has about 11,000 subscribers.
Mslexia: meaning.
Its name is an amalgam of "Ms", meaning woman, and "lexia", meaning words.
According to the official "Mslexia" website:
Mslexia means women’s writing (ms = woman lexia = words). Its association with dyslexia is intentional. Dyslexia is a difficulty, more prevalent in men, with reading and spelling. Mslexia is a difficulty, more prevalent in women, with getting into print. Mslexia is the complex set of conditions and expectations that prevents women, who as girls so outshine boys in verbal skills, from becoming successful authors. The magazine Mslexia aims to define, explore and help overcome the condition of mslexia and provide a platform and playground for women writers. Its intention is to provide information, guidance and inspiration for published and unpublished authors, and improve the quality and standing of women’s literature."
Availability.
It is available by subscription or from Borders bookshops around the UK, larger branches of Waterstones and some independent bookshops such as Foyles in London (UK), Arnolfini Books in Bristol (UK), Mercurysubs in Auckland (NZ), as well as a few shops in Europe.

Jakob Martin Strid

Jakob Martin Strid (born 1972) is a Danish cartoonist, who is known throughout Denmark for his successful series "Strid" in the Danish newspaper "Politiken".
Before his mainstream success he drew for the socialist paper "Socialisten"; both runs consisted mostly of satire on political events. He is decidedly on the political left, but every public figure is a target. His "Strid" series in "Politiken" featured (mostly) the artist himself (as his sobriquet "Strid") drawing, inviting guests and wandering off into intentionally far-fetched plots. There was much controversy around the strip when it ran in "Politiken" as he expressed sympathy with the Rote Armee Fraktion.
He has recently published several children's books.

<doc id="2882985" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2882985" title="Load-link/store-conditional">
Load-link/store-conditional

In computer science, load-link and store-conditional (LL/SC) are a pair of instructions used in multithreading to achieve synchronization. Load-link returns the current value of a memory location, while a subsequent store-conditional to the same memory location will store a new value only if no updates have occurred to that location since the load-link. Together, this implements a lock-free atomic read-modify-write operation.
They were originally proposed by Jensen, Hagensen, and Broughton for the S-1 AAP multiprocessor at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Load-link is also known as "load-linked", "load and reserve", or "load-locked".
Comparison of LL/SC and compare-and-swap.
If any updates have occurred, the store-conditional is guaranteed to fail, even if the value read by the load-link has since been restored. As such, an LL/SC pair is stronger than a read followed by a compare-and-swap (CAS), which will not detect updates if the old value has been restored (see ABA problem).
Real implementations of LL/SC do not always succeed if there are no concurrent updates to the memory location in question. Any exceptional events between the two operations, such as a context switch, another load-link, or even (on many platforms) another load or store operation, will cause the store-conditional to spuriously fail. Older implementations will fail if there are "any" updates broadcast over the memory bus. This is often called "weak" LL/SC by researchers, as it breaks many theoretical LL/SC algorithms. Weakness is relative, and some weak implementations can be used for some algorithms.
LL/SC is more difficult to emulate than CAS. Additionally, stopping running code between paired LL/SC instructions, such as when single-stepping through code, can prevent forward progress, making debugging tricky.
Implementations.
All of Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS, and ARM provide LL/SC instructions: ldl_l/stl_c and ldq_l/stq_c (Alpha), lwarx/stwcx (PowerPC), ll/sc (MIPS), and ldrex/strex (ARM version 6 and above).
Most platforms provide multiple sets of instructions for different data sizes; e.g., ldarx/stdcx for doubleword on the PowerPC.
Some CPUs require the address being accessed exclusively to be configured in write-through mode.
Some CPUs track the load-linked address at a cache-line or other granularity, such that any modification to any portion of the cache line (whether via another core's store-conditional or merely by an ordinary store) is sufficient to cause the store-conditional to fail.
All of these platforms provide weak LL/SC. The PowerPC implementation allows an LL/SC pair to wrap loads and even stores to other cache lines (although this approach is vulnerable to false cache line sharing). This allows it to implement, for example, lock-free reference counting in the face of changing object graphs with arbitrary counter reuse (which otherwise requires double compare-and-swap, DCAS).
The ARM implementation defines platform dependent blocks, ranging from 8 bytes to 2048 bytes, and an LL/SC attempt in any given block fails if there is between the LL and SC a normal memory access inside the same block. The ARM implementation is the strongest and most practical.
LL/SC has two advantages over CAS when designing a load-store architecture: reads and writes are separate instructions, as required by the design philosophy (and pipeline architecture); and both instructions can be performed using only two registers (address and value), fitting naturally into LSA encoding schemes. CAS, on the other hand, requires three registers (address, old value, new value) and a dependency between the value read and the value written. x86, being a CISC architecture, does not have this constraint; though modern chips may well translate a CAS instruction into separate LL/SC micro-operations internally.

FR-V (microprocessor)

The Fujitsu FR-V (Fujitsu RISC-VLIW) is one of the very few processors ever able to process both a very long instruction word (VLIW) and vector processor instructions at the same time, increasing throughput with high parallel computing while increasing performance per watt and hardware efficiency. The family was presented in 1999. Its design was influenced by the VPP500/5000 models of the Fujitsu VP/2000 vector processor supercomputer line. 
Featuring a 1-8 way very long instruction word (VLIW, Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD), up to 256 bit) instruction set it additionally uses a 4-way single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) vector processor core. A 32-bit RISC instruction set in the superscalar core is combined with most variants integrating a dual 16-bit media processor also in VLIW and vector architecture. Each processor core is superpipelined as well as 4-unit superscalar. 
A typical integrated circuit integrates a system on a chip and further multiplies speed by integrating multiple cores. Due to the very low power requirements it is a solution even for battery-powered applications.
Variants.
The family started with the FR-500, includes FR-300, FR-400, FR-450, FR-550 and FR1000 architecture 32-bit processors, can run Linux, RTLinux, VxWorks, eCos, ITRON or cryptlib and is also supported by the Softune Integrated development environment and the GNU Compiler Collection or GNUPro.
It is often used for image processing or video processing with most variants including a dual 16-bit media-processor.
Technology.
The 2005 presented FR1000 uses a core with 8-way 256-bit VLIW (MIMD) filling its superpipeline as well as a 4-unit superscalar architecture (Integer (ALU)-, Floating-point- and two media-processor-units), further increasing its peak performance of each core to up to 28 instructions per clock cycle. Like other VLIW-architectures 1 way is needed to load the next 256-bit instruction: 7-ways usable. Due to the used 4-way single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) vector processor-core, it counts to up to 112 data-operations per cycle and core. The included 4-way vector processor units are a 32-bit integer arithmetic logic unit and floating point unit as well as a 16-bit media-processor, which can process up to twice the operations in parallel.
The included integer- and floating-point unit enables the FR-V to execute complex tasks fully independent without need for help from a control unit; for example the Nikon EXPEED needs only a slowly clocked, quite simple Fujitsu FR controller as the main control unit for all included FR-V, DSP and GPU processors and data communication and other modules. Some processors have integrated memory management unit (MMU), allowing to run virtual multitasking operating systems (also real-time operating systems) with hardware memory protection.
Applications.
They are used to built the Milbeaut signal processors specialized for image processing, with the newest version additionally including an FR-V based HD video H.264 codec engine. 
The Milbeaut image engines are included in the Leica S2 and Leica M, Nikon DSLRs (see Nikon EXPEED), some Pentax K mount cameras and for the Sigma True-II processor.

Murder of Farah Noor Adams

Farah Noor Adams (1970/1971 – October 7, 2005) was a Scottish woman who was murdered in Glasgow in 2005. She was a part-time youth worker, aged 34, a Muslim, separated from her husband, bringing up a daughter aged eight. She was raped twice, beaten with a brick then murdered while exercising on a footpath beside the River Kelvin in Maryhill. Volunteers working on the Forth and Clyde Canal discovered her body around two hours after she dropped her daughter off at school. The case shocked many Glaswegians because it took place in broad daylight in a fairly busy area of the city. Adams' estranged husband had previously been jailed for six years for attempting to murder her, but the police quickly eliminated him from the enquiry. Glasgow Muslim community leaders Bashir Maan and Mohammad Sarwar M.P. have visited her family.

On October 11, Thomas Waddell, aged 18, from Maryhill, was arrested in connection with the case. On February 6, 2006 he pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Adams. Waddell has received a minimum of 16 years in prison.

Matthias Jabs

Matthias Jabs (born October 25, 1955) is a German guitarist and songwriter. He is best known for being the lead guitarist in the heavy metal band Scorpions. He has played on all Scorpions studio albums starting with Lovedrive (1979) to Sting in the Tail (2010). He has a music store, MJ Guitars, in Munich, Germany. 
Career.
Before joining the Scorpions, Jabs played for the bands Lady, Fargo and Deadlock. Jabs was hired to join the Scorpions upon the departure of guitarist Ulrich Roth in August 1978.
According the Scorpions wiki (under the Rise to fame and Commercial Success sections):
Departure of Uli Roth
"For the follow-up Taken by Force, RCA Records made a determined effort to promote the album in stores and on the radio. The album's single, "Steamrock Fever", was added to some of RCA's radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band's Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, Electric Sun prior to the release of the resultant double live album Tokyo Tapes. Tokyo Tapes was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid 1978, after auditioning around 140 guitarists, Scorpions recruited guitarist Matthias Jabs."
Michael Schenker's short stint back in the group
"Following the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for Mercury Records in the United States and Harvest/EMI Electrola worldwide to record their next album Lovedrive. Just weeks after being ejected from UFO for his alcohol abuse, Michael Schenker also returned to the group for a short period during the recordings for the album. This gave the band three guitarists (though Schenker's contribution to the final release was limited to only three songs). The result was Lovedrive, an album which some critics consider to be the pinnacle of their career. Containing such fan favourites as "Loving You Sunday Morning", "Always Somewhere", "Holiday" and the instrumental "Coast to Coast", it firmly cemented the 'Scorpions formula' of hard rock songs mixed with melodic ballads...
After the completion and release of the album the band decided to retain Michael in the band, forcing Jabs to leave. However after a few weeks of the tour, Michael, still coping with alcoholism missed a number of gigs and at one point collapsed on stage. Jabs was brought back to fill in for him on those occasions when he could not perform. In April 1979, during their tour in France, Jabs was brought in permanently to replace Michael."
Jabs' playing style was a large part of "Lovedrive"'s fresher, newer, heavier sound. This "Van Halen-like" sound would become the band's signature as it would propel them into superstardom in the 1980s. 
In the year 2000, he was awarded the city of Hanover plaque and the Cross of Merit on Ribbon (Verdienstkreuz am Bande) of the Lower Saxony Order of Merit.
Jabs was discovered by Francis Buchholz, who helped him learn mathematics. 
Equipment.
During the 1980s, he had a 1963-64 black Fender Stratocaster, called his "trouble guitar". It had had a Floyd Rose floating bridge and a Bill Lawrence L90 pickup. The guitar was featured on many tracks that needed a tremolo, including "Blackout". A copy of this guitar (with a black Gibson humbucker) is seen on the 'Make a Difference Foundation' video filmed in Russia. This event had other guests including Ozzy Osbourne and Gorky Park.
Jabs favours Gibson Explorer guitars, he even designed a model for them, called the Explorer 90 (due to the body being 90% the size of a regular Explorer) in the late 1980s. He also has a signature Fender Stratocaster dubbed the "Jabocaster". Nowadays, Jabs and the rest of the Scorpions play the German-made Dommenget brand of guitars. All of the band's signature models are made by them. His most recent signature guitar is his "Mastercaster" which was used mostly on stage and on their Humanity - Hour 1 album. Jabs is also notable for using a Talk box on some songs (such as "The Zoo" on "Animal Magnetism", "To Be No. 1" on "Eye II Eye", "Money and Fame" ("Crazy World"), "Can You Feel It" ("Unbreakable"), "Media Overkill" ("Savage Amusement") ), and "Raised on Rock" ("Sting in the Tail").
Jabs replaces the Marshall amplification logo on his amplifier cabinets with his own name, in the same font style as the Marshall logo. Besides Marshall, Matthias also uses Wizard cabinets, Hiwatt, ENGL, Fender Prosonic and Soldano amplifiers and cabinets, Kitty Hawk preamps, D'andrea picks, and Seymour Duncan JB pickups. Back in the 1980s, he used marshall JCM 800 2210 amplifiers which you can see on the World Wide Live DVD. Jabs also currently uses Ovation 6 and 12 string acoustic guitars, D'addario strings (which are tuned to E-flat and D), and talk boxes from Heil. In 2010, Cort Guitars collaborated with Matthias to develop his own signature line of electric guitars called the Garage 1 and Garage 2.

SECR C class

The South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) C Class is a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive, designed by Harry Wainwright and built between 1900 and 1908. They were designed for freight duties, although occasionally used for passenger trains. They operated over the lines of the railway in London and south-east England until the early 1960s. One example was rebuilt as an S Class saddle tank
History.
The SECR held trials in November 1898 to decide on a standard freight locomotive design. Two existing 0-6-0 locomotives were tested: former London, Chatham and Dover Railway B2 class No. 194 designed by William Kirtley; and former South Eastern Railway O class No. 436 designed by James Stirling. The Kirtley design proved superior and a new order for 40 locomotives based on it was placed. These new locomotives were designed by Harry Wainwright, the new Chief Mechanical Engineer of the railway, and formed the first of the C class. 
The first fifteen locomotives were constructed by Neilson, Reid and Company and delivered in June 1900, followed by a further fifteen from Sharp, Stewart and Company. The remainder were built by the SECR workshops at Ashford (70 examples 1900-1908) and Longhedge Works (9 examples 1903-4).
Operational use.
The locomotives were used on freight services and occasional passenger excursion trains (such as hop-picking specials), throughout the SER between Reading railway station and the Kent Coast. The last twelve locomotives were fitted with steam carriage heating equipment to enable them to be used to haul prepare empty stock for express trains. The remainder of the class were also so equipped by the Southern Railway after 1923.
Withdrawal.
In common with other freight locomotives in Southern England, the class was very heavily used during the Second World War and repairs and maintenance deferred. As a result one locomotive had to be withdrawn in December 1947, but the remaining 107 examples entered service with British Railways in 1948. Withdrawals of the remainder of the class began in 1953, but accelerated after the Kent Coast electrification in 1959-1960. However, three examples (31271, 31280, 31592) remained in Departmental stock as shunters at Ashford Works until 1966.
S class conversion.
In 1917 one example, no. 685 was converted into an S class 0-6-0ST for use as a heavy-duty shunter at Richborough port which was then being used to ship locomotives and armoured equipment to the Western Front. After the War it was used as a shunter at Bricklayers' Arms until 1951.
Preservation.
One, No. 592 (Southern Railway 1592, BR 31592), has been preserved on the Bluebell Railway. It has recently returned to traffic after its most recent overhaul in 2007. In 1999, it featured as "The Green Dragon" locomotive in the a television film "The Railway Children".

Mundaka

Mundaka is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the autonomous community of Basque Country, northern Spain. On the coast, Mundaka is internationally-renowned for its surfing scene.
Mundaka is accessible from Bilbao by EuskoTren on the Bermeo line.
History.
Mundaka is known as one of the most important places of the Lordship of Biscay, it was the birthplace of Jaun Zuria, the first Lord of Biscay, son of the Scottish princess who arrived in Mundaka escaping from an English King. The name of the town has Danish origin, it has been proven that the Vikings arrived there 900 years ago. According to the history of the Lordship, Mundaka has the oldest temple of Biscay, as a result, it has the first seat of the General Parliament.
The port is in the center point of the town, from there the old part of the town grew. All the houses are medieval, fishermen's houses, always looking to the sea.
The anteiglesia of Mundaka is already mentioned in the year 1051 in the donation of the Dominion of Biscay to the Monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla and in 1070 in the donation of the aforementioned church to the Monastery of San Juan de la Peña.
Toponym.
There is a well-known legend that attributes the name "'Mundaca"' to the Latin phrase "munda aqua" ('clean water'). This legend appears in the Chronicle of Biscay written by Lope García de Salazar in the 15th century. According to this story, a ship from Scotland carrying a princess who had been banished from her homeland arrived on the coast of Mundaka. The Scots called the place "in their Latin language" (sic) "Munda aqua" since there they had found a source of very clean water that contrasted with the murky waters of the estuary of Urdaibai. This princess would have a son who would come to be called Jaun Zuria and would become, according to legend, the first Lordship of Vizcaya. This legend may also explain why Mundaca is ranked "first" among the anteiglesias of Biscay.
Apart from legendary explanations, the etymology of Mundaka is uncertain. The first written mention of Mundaka dates from 1070, when it was referred to as "Mondaka".
"Ego Mome Nunnuç placuit in animis meis mitto in Sancti Johannis de Orioli de Aragone uno monasterio in Bickaga (Vizcaga) in locum quae dicitur Mondaka (Mondacha)"
Some have sought a Norse origin for the name, based on the likely presence of a medieval Viking settlement in the area. In Danish, "mund" means "mouth", and Mundaka lies precisely at the mouth of the estuary of the same Oka river .
Others have related the name "Mundaca" to a stock of Basque toponyms with the endings "-aka", "-eka", "-ika", which are especially abundant in Biscay and which can be linked with the Celto-Italic suffix "-aka". To some the origin of the name would be much older and it could be traced back to an era in which Vizcaya could have been populated by a Celtic people.
Traditionally the name was written as "'Mundaca"', but nowadays it is more commonly written as "'Mundaka"', which is an adaptation to the modern rules of spelling of the Basque language. Mundaka is usually regarded as the formal name in Castilian and Mundaka in Basque. Since 1982 the official name of the municipality has been Mundaka. The new denomination was published in BOE in 1989.
The demonym is "'mundaqués / a"' in Spanish and "'mundakarra"' Basque.
Mundaca, like Munitibar (Munditibar), stem Munio, Mundio (Muniozguren, Munitiz) which means Hill, hillock. Aka is a suffix known as slope, slope, as also is Ika and Eka. And seeing where Mundaca is located this is very logical: slope of the entangled or the Hill.
Note the similarity of Mundi and Mendi, as well meaning a hill and a mountain.
Physical Geography.
Mundaca borders to the West with the town of Bermeo, to the South with Pedernales, and to the East and North with the Cantabrian Sea. The island of Ízaro (Bermeo) and the extensive Laida arenal are located off its coast. The municipal area is concentrated around the port, at the feet of Mount Katillotxu (337 & nbsp; m) and the alto de Betrocol.
On the beach in Laidatxu flows the stream Errekatxu.
Its coastal location allows you to enjoy a mild climate both in summer and in winter, with infrequent frost.
Population.
The area has been populated since the lower Paleolithic, as attest the caves of Santimamiñe on the other side of the estuary and deposits found in Portuondo.
There are speculations with the arrival in the area of Vikings, who according to some authors justify the presence of blond types of blue eyes on the Basque coast, unlike the Basque type of interior. Anton Erkoreka asserts its presence in the 9th century based on Arabic chronicles, medieval stories and other anthropological data, while Jon Juaristi believed to have actually been a few exiled Saxons dethroned by the Vikings.
Before them the Romans arrived attracted by the marble of Ereño and whose presence bears witness to a branch of Roman roads in Balmaseda that reaches Bermeo.
Since the first census that has news until the 1900s (decade), the population increased reaching 2284 residents in 1910, with different ups and downs due to various avatars of the time. In the 1950s, the population had already dropped to 1500 residents, stabilizing the successive censuses around 1650 inhabitants. Since 1990 the town shows a slight positive trend.
Government.
The municipal power while the "immunity of Vizcaya" continued was exercised by the inhabitants. These were the only ones who could adopt ordinances, usages and customs that were to govern themselves, due to their nature of autonomous community and without having to submit to the terms for the granting of the Charter puebla, as happened to the villas. Thus, all mundaqueses, including the widows who were head of the family and could vote, gathered in Assembly or "stop cross" to achieve their agreements, chairing the "' faithful Alderman"'. Between the faculties of the faithful was the representation of the autonomous community in the County Councils of Biscay until they ceased to meet due to the abolition of immunity in 1876. Since then, the post became known as Mayor. Since the transition, the Basque nationalist party governs the Town Hall with an absolute majority.
Municipal Elections 2011.
Four parties stood in the 2011 municipal elections; EAJ-PNV, Bildu, PSE-EE and PP. These were the results:
This gave PNV control of the council. Bildu, a pro-Basque independence coalition, won 3 seats, while PSE-EE and popular failed to achieve representation due to the low number of votes obtained.
Culture and tourism.
Cuisine.
The main dish of its kitchen is, by maritime tradition, fish, and especially the bass of Mundaka.
Sports.
Surfing.
Mundaka is well renowned world wide for its quality of surf. Huge swells roll in from the Bay of Biscay and slam into the rocky coastline of the Basque Country. The estuary at Mundaka has created a perfect sandbar which forms hollow waves that can be watched from the town's harbor wall. Mundaka was formerly one of the sites of the World Championship Tour of Surfing.[http://www.surfline.com/surf-report/mundaka-spain_6894/travel/]
Some great surfers have marked their legacy on Mundaka such as Andy Irons, Taj Burrow, Bobby Martinez, Kelly Slater, Mark Occilupo and Joel Parkinson.

Mungia

Mungia is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country of northern Spain. The
town has 15,000 inhabitants.
Geography.
Mungia lies 20 metres above sea level in an area full of open spaces, with a landscape of rolling hills; among these last are Gondramendi (217 m), Tallu (342 m) and Berreaga (366 m). The more important mountains nearby are Sollube (684 m) and Jata (592 m); these surround the valley of the Butroi river, which rises at the mountain of Bizkargi (536 m) and flows to the sea at the Plentzia estuary.
There are many small streams and underground springs, such as the Atxuri, Trobika, Lauromendi, Atebarri, or Mantzorriko Erreka, which are all tributaries of the Butroi river and provide water to the numerous fountains built in the town. In the past those waters helped to run more than 20 mills, some of which are still standing today.
History.
Although there are still traces which show that the area where Mungia stands today was inhabited in prehistoric times (there is a castro - a fortified place where an army used to camp - in Berreaga, and some steles of various ages have been found in neighbouring towns) the first documented reference we have dates back to the year 1051, when an abbot from Mungia ( "Mome Munchiensis abba" ) confirmed a gift from the Lord of Biscay to the Monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla.
At the beginning, Mungia, whose name comes from the Basque "Mune - Ganean"(which refers to its location at the edge of the Butroi river), was not much more than a tiny village with a very dispersed population. At that time the church was the only focus of the community, but the settlement later began to acquire its own significance as a result of the presence of an abbot and of its location in a strategic pass between the interior of the feudal holding and the coast, primarily at Bermeo, which had begun to stand out as an export harbour. Under these conditions, important families belonging to the nobility settled in the surrounding areas of the village and built there their tower houses. The economic power of these noblemen was based on landholdings.
However, as a consequence of a stockbreeding and agricultural crisis at the end of the 13th century, these families began to suffer. To face this situation they sought very hard to improve their income streams, and usually the easiest recourse they could have was to violence. On the pretext of "being more worthy" they fought with each other, and their peasants were decimated and deprived of their scarce belongings, or even involved in faction fights themselves.
In the area of Mungia, we find representatives of two factions: the Billela family which was part of the Ganboar faction. and the Butroi family which led the faction of Oinaz. As the tower houses of both families were next to each other their fights were a common event.
The borough of Mungia came to be as a consequence of this situation. Some of the inhabitants in the area, witnessing the outrages of the nobility, requested the then Lord of Biscay, the Infante Juan, to grant the title of borough to their town, in order to enable the fortification of the town and thus effective defence against attacks.
By this means on 1 August 1376, under the Fueros of Logroño, the borough of Mungia was created in the centre of an "anteiglesia" (a village or municipal district specific to the Basque provinces) similar in extent to the Parish) of the same name. Both belonged to the merindad of Uribe (an important and bigger borough which defended and governed all the towns and country houses inside its boundaries), and each had an autonomous municipality. In the same way, they each had their own representation in the Juntas of Gernika (the governmental council representing the people of Biscay), numbering 69 for the anteiglesia and 15 for the borough. But the fact of designating a borough did not avoid a great number of fights in the area. Thus, there were various episodes of different nature, arising from the wars between the factions. Just to name a few of the most important of those small skirmishes, we mention the battle of Berteiz or the battle of Mungia, which took place on 27 April 1479 and in which the factions of Oinaz and Ganboa, enemies up to that moment, formed an alliance to fight against the Earl of Haro.
Leaving these episodes aside, life in Mungia is thought to have been calm. Economic activity was mainly based on farming, with a few mills located on the banks of the many streams which washed the area, as well as small craft workshops settled down in the borough.
The daily round was rarely disturbed. In 1602 there was a fire, and a larger fire 1778 on 9 November with fourteen of the main buildings in the village burned down. From this time, to prevent accidents happening, all inflammable products such as straw, wood and coal were stored in a place outside the enceinte. This site was known as "Atzekaldeta", a basque name which refers to the location of the place in the rear part of the town.
Thus time passed quietly for both the borough of Mungia and the "anteiglesia" of the same name. They were independent entities, although they joined together for the sake of some services and improvements. Thus, the school was common to both, and when the time arrived to canalise the water from the Gondramendi mountain to the village both shared the expenditure. Little by little, more tasks were performed together and as a result of this co-operation even bigger problems arose leading to the idea of joining both bodies and becoming one unique entity.
This happened on 6 October 1900 when a ceremony was held; thereafter, the borough and the "anteiglesia" merged and became one for the future. The fountain which today lies in "Beko Kale", in front of "Arnaga", is the symbol of this unity under the motto "Biak bat eta biena" (Both only one and for both).
Up to 1936 life for the inhabitants passed by without major events, based on fundamental rural and agricultural activities, but with an increasing development of crafts and trade. During the Spanish Civil War Mungia was one of the towns most heavily punished in bombardments by fascist troops. Moreover, while withdrawing from Mungia anarchist groups out of control burned some of the buildings in the town.
The war stopped growth taking place in Mungia. And yet, at the beginning of the 1960s, industrialisation in the area would appeal to many potential workers, in a migration not only from neighbouring towns but also from the rest of Spain. A few years later a large number of new buildings and streets were erected, expanding the town centre remarkably.
The recession at the end of the 1970s brought a short period of recession in Mungia, which had repercussions in the whole town; up to then Mungia had experienced a huge growth of population.
For the long years of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, the resistance movement was based on civic associations. Various groups looked for help in institutions such as the Church which worked as an umbrella to support cultural, sporting and educational activities. Those activities sought the preservation and recovery of Basque culture and the establishment of a democratic culture.

Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.

Spring Valley is an affluent neighborhood in 
northwest Washington, D.C., known for its large homes and tree-lined streets and more recently for being a military superfund site of former Camp Leach. It houses most of the main campus of American University, which gives its name to the neighborhood to Spring Valley's northeast, American University Park.
Description.
The neighborhood houses the main campus of American University at 4400 Massachusetts Avenue, the Wesley Theological Seminary at 4500 Massachusetts Avenue, and Washington College of Law at 4801 Massachusetts Avenue and 4910 Massachusetts Avenue. Nebraska Avenue and Loughboro Road are to its south, Dalecarlia Parkway is to its west, and Massachusetts Avenue is to its northeast. Paradoxically, the neighborhood to the northeast is called American University Park, even though the bulk of the main campus is located in Spring Valley.
Spring Valley's residents include notable media personalities (e.g., Ann Compton, Jim Vance), lawyers (e.g., United States Attorney General Eric Holder, Brendan Sullivan), politicians, corporate officers, and elite Washington society (e.g., Washington Nationals principal owners Ed Cohen and Debra Cohen). After the second world war, General of the Army Omar Bradley moved to a house on Indian lane in Spring Valley. Richard Nixon lived in neighboring Wesley Heights before becoming President; his immediate predecessor, Lyndon B. Johnson, after becoming Vice President under John F. Kennedy, purchased a three-story mansion named Les Ormes (The Elms) in Spring Valley along 52nd Street NW that had previously been the home of socialite and ambassador Perle Mesta. George H. W. Bush also lived in the neighborhood prior to his White House years. Presently it is the residence of the ambassador of Algeria. Warren Buffett and sister Doris Buffett lived on 49th Street during their years attending Wilson High School. Other notable residents include celebrity Monty Bullock and Erasmus B. Draggen.
Several embassy residences are located in the neighborhood, such as the ambassador's houses of South Korea, Canada, Croatia, Mexico, Bahrain, Qatar, Uganda, Chile, Luxembourg, Algeria and Yemen. Spring Valley's median home sale price in 2007 was US$2.725 million and in 2008 $3.022 million.
Military Superfundsite.
During World War I Spring Valley was an undeveloped area on the main campus of American University that the Army was allowed to use for testing chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, therefore also known as the "American University Experimental Station" or Camp American University and Camp Leach. In 1993, during excavations of a utility trench, construction workers found unexploded ordnance, and scientists found high levels of arsenic in the soil. This touched off a cleanup effort by the Environmental Protection Agency and Army who call it the "Spring Valley Formerly Used Defense Site". Cleanup lasted merely two years at first. A decade later, in 2003 many more dangerous sites in the area were uncovered, including perchlorate in groundwater and three burial pits on grounds of the South Korean ambassador’s residence. In 2005 ATSDR issued a "Health Consultation", and 2 years later Johns Hopkins University was contracted for a health study, and reported in 2007. A review of all site data and previous health studies was supposed to be completed by 2013. As of 2014, the work is still ongoing with tons of earth being replaced and at least one house being scheduled for demolition. 
A Restoration Advisory Board is in place. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the lead agency in clean up.

<doc id="2883042" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2883042" title="Abney Park">
Abney Park

Abney Park is situated in Stoke Newington, London, England. It is a 13ha (32 acre) park dating from just before 1700, named after Lady Mary Abney and associated with Dr Isaac Watts. In the early 18th century, the park was accessed via the frontages and gardens of two large mansions — her own manor house (Abney House), and the neighbouring Fleetwood House. Both mansions fronted onto Church Street in what was then a quiet Nonconformist village.
Parkland.
In the early 18th century, Lady Mary Abney laid out Abney Park after inheriting the Manor of Stoke Newington in 1701 from her brother Thomas Gunston. Initially she and her husband Sir Thomas Abney lived there part-time, also living at his residence in Hertfordshire. She began work on the park in those years. 
After her husband's death in 1722, Lady Mary moved to Abney House full-time, becoming the first Lady of the Manor of Stoke Newington in her own right. She was said to be helped in designing the landscaping of the grounds as an English garden by the learned Dr Isaac Watts, who had been a long-term house guest of her and her late husband, and continued to live in her household. The neighbouring Hartopp family of Fleetwood House, who leased the eastern part of the park to Lady Mary, also helped with the park.
Her improvements included planting of the Great Elm Walk and Little Elm Walk, which established shady walkways down to the island heronry of the Hackney Brook at the bottom of the park. Both Wych Elm and English Elm were planted. The Hartopp family had already completed one of the early plantings of a Cedar of Lebanon tree in Great Britain, adjacent to an ornamental pond. This tree survived into the 1920s and is illustrated in many engravings of the period.
Other trees planted at an early date at Abney Park (either in the portion leased by Fleetwood House, or that attached solely to Abney House) included American Larch and Tulip Trees from the New World. The Nonconformists of Stoke Newington had strong connections to colonists in New England.
Abney House.
Abney Park was dominated by Abney House. For some time in the early decades of the 19th century, it was the residence of James William Freshfield and his family. 
In its final years, it was adapted for use as a Wesleyan Methodist training college or seminary (c.1838/9-1843). Rev. John Farrar was the governor of the college. He was elected Secretary of the Methodist Conference on fourteen occasions and twice its President. When the Methodists moved into their first purpose-built college at Richmond, south of London in 1843, Farrar was appointed as the Classical Tutor. He worked there until 1857.
After 1843, Abney House was 'recycled' (broken up for sale as building materials) for the building trade of the rapidly expanding metropolis, as was common in the Victorian era.
Fleetwood House.
Fleetwood House was built in the 1630s for Sir Edward Hartopp. By marriage the estate passed to Charles Fleetwood, one of Oliver Cromwell's generals, and was named for him. It was later owned by various parties. from whom it got its name, and then through various parties. It served as a meeting place for Dissenters and Nonconformists, for which residents Stoke Newington was known.
In the grounds was a third building, called the Summerhouse. From 1774, it was used as a summer residence by the family of young James Stephen (1758-1832). Although not a Quaker, he became closely with the abolitionist cause, which they supported. In 1800, he married a sister of his friend William Wilberforce, who visited Stoke Newington regularly. Between them, the two men drafted the Slave Trade Act 1807, to prohibit the international slave trade originating in Africa.
In 1824, Fleetwood House was adapted for use as a new Quaker school, known as Newington Academy for Girls (also Newington College for Girls). In a time when girls' educational opportunities were limited, it offered a wide range of subjects (including sciences) "on a plan in degree differing from any hitherto adopted", according to the prospectus. It commissioned the world's first school bus, designed by George Shillibeer. 
One of the school's founders was William Allen, a Quaker active with the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. His marriage to Grizell Hoare was the subject of a satirical cartoon, in which the school is referred to as the Newington Nunnery. Joseph Pease, later the first Quaker MP, wrote a doggerel verse praising Allen's marriage.
Fleetwood House was demolished in 1872. A fire station was constructed on the site.

Ruby Allen

Ruby Allen is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera "EastEnders", played by Louisa Lytton. Her first appearance was on 18 March 2005 and her last was on 23 November 2006. Ruby and her casting were announced on 3 February 2005. In December 2009, Lytton said she would have liked her "EastEnders" exit to have been more dramatic. Lytton also said that she will always be grateful for the part of Ruby.
Storylines.
Ruby arrives in Walford, having run away from boarding school to look for her father, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). On her arrival, she is befriended by Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), who grills Ruby about her family. After storming out of the café where they are talking, she is mugged by a vagrant in Bridge Street, who grabs hold of Ruby's coat and steals her mobile phone. She is then almost run over by Tina Stewart's (Charlotte Avery) taxi. Ruby feels that Johnny is pushing her away and reminds him that he only saved her by accident when their house caught fire. He was actually trying to save her sister, Scarlet. Scarlet and their mother, Stephanie, died in the fire in March 2004. Ruby is livid when Johnny reveals his mistress Tina (the woman who had almost run her over), but later accepts the relationship. Ruby overhears Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) telling people that Johnny is a violent, murdering bully. Ruby confronts him and he denies it. She knows he is lying and stays with Stacey initially and then Peggy at Pat Evans' (Pam St. Clement) house.
Ruby catches Johnny having an affair with Amy (Nina Fry) while he is engaged to Tina. She tells Tina and Tina leaves. Ruby eventually forgives her father and moves back in with him but later moves in with boyfriend, Juley Smith (Joseph Kpobie), to whom she lost her virginity. Johnny doesn't take kindly to this, as he has already warned Juley about Ruby. Ruby defends Juley and even turns against her dad for him, but she is devastated to learn that Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) was paying Juley to sleep with her as part of his feud with Johnny. She reacts by getting drunk and collapsing on the floor. Phil, who has broken into Johnny's house to have it out with him, takes her to hospital. Juley attempts to get Ruby back, and she eventually agrees to try again. However, she realises that she couldn't trust him when she found herself questioning his phone calls.
Ruby discovers that Johnny was an alcoholic in "Get Johnny Week" and she left him to Phil. She and Grant have a heart to heart, and Grant discovers that Phil paid Juley to sleep with Ruby. Grant is furious and burst into Johnny's office where Phil is holding Johnny until he confesses to Dennis's murder. This gives Johnny a chance to get away. There is a big chase, which results in Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) handcuffing the brothers and marching them into the forest. He is about to kill Grant when Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) shot him instead and kills him. Ruby persuades Johnny to hand himself in, and then returns with Jake to Walford. She is furious with him when he reveals he had killed Danny. Jake becomes obsessed with Ruby's welfare, but took over the running over her club until she turned 18 in October. Ruby withdraws £2000 for a holiday but decides to return it and is mugged by Juley. Ruby then had a relationship with Sean Slater (Robert Kazinsky), Stacey's brother. Ruby finds out that her father had had a heart attack after an argument with Sean in prison. On the day of Johnny's funeral, Ruby goes missing and Sean finds her, slumped behind the desk in the Scarlet office, with a bottle of vodka. Later, she speaks to Pat who made her think, by saying that her father was normally right about people, including Jake and Sean. Ruby later left Walford in the back of a cab, having fallen out with Stacey once again.
Character creation.
Ruby and her casting were announced on 3 February 2005. Louisa Lytton was cast in the role. Speaking of her casting, Lytton commented "I'm nervous and excited all at the same time to be joining "EastEnders". This is an amazing opportunity and I can't believe that I'm going to be working alongside some of my favourite actors and actresses." On 8 July 2006, Daniel Saney of Digital Spy reported Lytton would be written out of "EastEnders" following a mutual decision between the producers and the actress herself. It was decided that the character had no further purpose after the departure of her on-screen father, Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). A spokesperson said "The way the storylines pan out means there's not really much scope for Louisa's character any more." Lytton revealed that she had enjoyed her time at "EastEnders", and called it a great experience. She added that she was looking forward to trying new things. Executive producer Kate Harwood stated that Lytton was popular with fans and her character would get a "dramatic" exit.
In December 2009, Lytton said she would have liked her "EastEnders" exit to have been more dramatic. Speaking to an "FHM" writer, Lytton explained that her exit, which saw Ruby leave in a black cab with her father's ashes, would have been better if it was something "massive" and "dramatic". In August 2011, Lytton said that she would love to return to the show. She stated that she would immediately cause trouble and come back as a "hard-faced bitch", as Ruby often let people walk over her and constantly cried. Lytton also said that she will always be grateful for the part of Ruby. Speaking to a writer from "OK Magazine", Lytton admitted that the experience was brilliant and helped give an insight of what she wanted to do in her career. She added "But there is so much I still want to do at home, like theatre, and build myself up, because I have missed out on things like drama schools. It's funny because when I was there they thought I was a huge star back in Britain!."

Polysomy

Polysomy is found in many species, including fungi, plants, insects, and mammals. Most eukaryotic species are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes, whereas prokaryotes are haploid, containing a single chromosome in each cell. Polysomy is a condition in which an organism has at least one more chromosome than normal, i.e., there may be three or more copies of the chromosome rather than the expected two copies. Aneuploids possess chromosome numbers that are not exact multiples of the haploid number and polysomy is a type of aneuploidy. A karyotype is the set of chromosomes in an organism and the suffix -"somy" is used to name aneuploid karyotypes. This is not to be confused with the suffix, -"ploidy", referring to the number of complete sets of chromosomes. Polysomy is usually caused by non-disjunction (the failure of a pair of homologous chromosomes to separate) during meiosis, but may also be due to a translocation mutation(a chromosome abnormality caused by rearrangement of parts between nonhomologous chromosomes). Polysomy is found in many diseases, including Down syndrome in humans where affected individuals possess three copies (trisomy) of chromosome 21. Down syndrome was initially described in 1866 by John Landon Down and almost a century passed before Jerome Lujeune correlated it with Trisomy 21 in 1959. 
Types.
Polysomy types are categorized based on the number of extra chromosomes in each set, noted as a diploid (2n) with an extra chromosome of various numbers. For example, a polysomy with three chromosomes is called a trisomy, a polysomy with four chromosomes is called tetrasomy, etc:
In mammals.
In canines.
Polysomy plays a role in canine leukemia, hemangiopericytomas, and thyroid tumors. Abnormalities of chromosome 13 have been observed in canine osteoid chondrosarcoma and lymphosarcoma. Trisomy 13 in dogs with lymphosarcoma show a longer duration of first remission (medicine) and survival, responding well to treatments with chemotherapeutic agents. Polysomy of chromosome 13 (Polysomy 13) is significant in the development of prostate cancer and is often caused by centric fusions. Since canine chromosome 13 is similar to human chromosome 8q, research could provide insight to treatment for prostate cancer in humans.
Polysomy of chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 25 are also frequently involved in canine tumors. Chromosome 1 may contain a gene responsible for tumor development and lead to changes in the karyotype, including fusion of the centromere, or centric fusions. Aneuploidy due to nondisjunction is a common feature in tumor cells.
In humans.
Sex chromosomes.
Some of the most frequent genetic disorders are abnormalities of sex chromosomes, but polysomies rarely occur. 49,XXXXY chromosome polysomy occurs every 1 in 85,000 newborn males. The incidence of other X polysomies (48,XXXX, 48,XXXY, 48,XXYY) is more rare than 49,XXXXY. Polysomy Y (47,XYY; 48,XYYY; 48,XXYY; 49,XXYYY) occurs in 1 out of 975 males and may cause psychiatric, social, and somatic abnormalities. Polysomy X may cause mental and developmental retardation and physical malformation. Klinefelter syndrome is an example of human polysomy X with the karyotype 47, XXY. X chromosome polysomies can be inherited from either a single maternal (49, X polysomies) or paternal (48, X polysomies) X chromosome. Polysomy of sex chromosomes is caused by successive nondisjunctions in meiosis I and II.
Chromosome 8.
Tetrasomy and hexasomy 8 are rare compared to trisomy 8, which is the most common karyotypic finding in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). AML, MDS, or myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) with a high incidence of secondary diseases and a six month survival rate are associated with a polysomy 8 syndrome.
Chromosome 17.
Overexpression of the HER2/neu gene on chromosome 17 and some type of polysomy has been reported in 8-68% of breast carcinomas. If theHER-2/neu gene does not amplify in the case of polysomy, proteins may be overexpressed and could lead to tumerogenesis. Polysomy 17 may complicate the interpretation of HER2 testing results in cancer patients. Chromosome 17 polysomy may not be present when the centromere is amplified, so it was later discovered that polysomy 17 is rare. This was discovered using array comparative genomic hybridization, a DNA-based alternative for clinical evaluation of HER2 gene copy number.
Trisomy 21.
Trisomy 21 is a form of Down syndrome that occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. The result is a genetic condition in which a person has 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46. During egg or sperm development the 21st chromosome does not separate during either the egg or sperm development. The end result is a cell that has 24 chromosomes. This extra chromosome may cause problems with the manner in which the body and brain develop.
Tetrasomy 9p.
Tetrasomy 9p is a rare condition in which people have a small extra chromosome that contains two copies of part of chromosome 9, in addition to having two normal chromosome 9’s as well. This condition may be diagnosed by analyzing a person’s blood sample since 9p is found in high concentrations in the blood. Ultrasound is another tool that may be utilized to identify tetrasomy 9p in infants prior to birth. Prenatal ultrasound may reveal several common characteristics including: growth restriction, ventriculomegaly, cleft lip or palate, and renal anomalies.
Tetrasomy 18p.
Tetrasomy 18p occurs when the short arm of the 18th chromosome appears four times, rather than twice, in the cells of the body. It is considered to be a rare disease and usually is not inherited. The mechanism of 18p formation appears to be the result of two independent events: centromeric misdivision and nondisjunction. Characteristic features of tetrasomy 18p include, but are not limited to: growth retardation, scoliosis, abnormal brain MRI, developmental delays, and strabismus.
In insects.
Germ line polysomy in the grasshopper.
Germ line cells develop into eggs and sperm and the associated inherited material can be passed down to future generations. As shown in the associated karyotype image, chromosomes 1-22 are grouped A-G. A population of male grasshoppers ("Chorthippus binotatus") from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) are polysomic mosaics (coming from cells of two genetically different types) possessing an extra E group chromosome(chromosomes 16, 17 & 18) in their testicles. Parents that exhibited polysomy did not pass the E chromosome abnormality to any of the offspring, so this is not something that is passed down to future generations. Male grasshoppers ("Atractomorpha similis") from Australia carry between one and ten extra copies of chromosome A9, with one being the most common in natural populations. Most polysomic males produce normal sperm. However, polysomy can be transmissible through both the male and female parents through nondisjunction.
Heterochromatic polysomy in the cricket.
Heterochromatin contains a small number of genes and densely staining nodules in or along chromosomes. 
The mole cricket chromosome number varies between 19-23 chromosomes depending on which part of the world in which they are located, including Jerusalem, Palestine, and Europe. Heterochromic polysomy is seen in mole-crickets with 23 chromosomes and may be a factor contributing to their evolution, specifically within the species "Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa", along with various living environments and mating systems.
X-chromosome polysomy in the fruit fly.
In the fruit fly, "Drosophila", one X chromosome in the male is almost the same as two X chromosomes in the female in terms of the gene product produced. Despite this, metafemales, or females having three X chromosomes, are unlikely to survive. It is possible that the extra X chromosome decreases gene expression and could explain why the metafemales rarely survive this X-chromosome polysomy.
In plants.
A karyotype rearrangement of individual chromosomes takes place when polysomy in plants in observed. The mechanism of this type of rearrangment is “non-disjunction, mis-segregation in diploids or polyploids; mis-segregation from multivalents in interchange heterozygotes.” Incidences of polysomy have been identified in many species of plants, including:
In fungi.
Few fungi have been researched so far and this may be due to the low number of chromosomes in fungi, 
as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. 
Polysomy of Chromosome 13 has been observed in the Flor strains of the yeast species "Saccharomyces cerevisiae". 
Chromosome 13 contains loci, specifically the ADH2 and ADH3 loci, which encode for the isozymes of alcohol dehydrogenase. 
These isozymes play a primary role in the biological aging of wines via ethanol oxidative utilization. 
Polysomy of Chromosome 13 is promoted when there is disruption of the yeast RNA1 gene with LEU2 sequences.
Diagnostic tools.
Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a cytogenetic technique that has proven to be useful in the diagnosis of patients with polysomy. Conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been used to detect various polysomies, including the most common autosomies (trisomy 13, 18, 21) as well as polysomy X and Y. 
Testing for chromosomal aneuploidy with Fluorescence in situ hybridization may increase the sensitivity of cytology and improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis. The Cervical Cancer, TERC, Fluorescence in situ hybridization test, detects amplification of the human telomerase RNA component (TERC) gene and/or polysomy of chromosome 3.
Spectral karyotyping.
Spectral karyotyping (SKY) looks at the entire karyotype by using fluorescent labels and assigning a particular color to each chromosome. SKY is usually performed after conventional cytogenic techniques have already detected an abnormal chromosome. FISH analysis is then used to confirm the identity of the chromosome.
Giemsa banding (G-banded karyotyping).
Karyotypes are commonly analyzed using Giemsa banding (G-banded karyotyping)). Each chromosome shows unique light and dark bands after they are denatured with trypsin and polysomies can be detected by counting the stained chromosomes. Several cells have to be analysed to detect mosaicism.
Microarray analysis.
Submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities that are too small to be detected via other means of karyotyping, may be identified by chromosomal microarray analysis. There are several existing microarray techniques that may be utilized during the prenatal diagnosis phase, and these include SNP arrays and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). CGH is a DNA-based diagnostic tool that has been used to detect polysomy 17 in breast cancer. CGH was first used in 1992 by Kallionemi at UC San Francisco. When used in conjunction with ultrasound findings, microarray analysis may be instrumental in the clinical diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities.
Prenatal diagnostic tests.
Prenatal and other diagnostic techniques such as immunocytochemistry (ICC) evaluation are usually followed by FISH or Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect chromosomal aneuploidies. Maternal blood sampling for fetal cells, often used to identify risk of trisomies 18 or 21, poses less risk as compared to amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling (CVS). Chorionic villus sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, amniocentesis can be used to obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970’s. The odds of having a child with polysomy increases as the age of the mother increases, so pregnant women over the age of 35 are tested.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.
RFLPs can be used to determine the origin and mechanism involved with Polysomy X and other chromosome heteromorphisms or chromosomes that differ in size, shape, or staining properties. Restriction enzymes cut DNA at a specific site and the DNA fragments that are left are called restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs. RFLP also aids in the identification of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene which is predictive of an adult-onset autosomal disorder called Huntington’s disease (HD). Mutations in chromosome 4 are able to be visualized when RFLP is used in conjunction with Southern blot analysis.
Flow Cytometry.
Human lymphocyte cultures may be analyzed by flow cytometry to assess chromosomal abnormalities, such as polyploidy, hypodiploidy, and hyperdiploidy. Flow cytometers have the ability to analyze thousands of cells each second and are commonly used to isolate specific cell populations.

Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Coimbatore

Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya, Coimbatore is a group of educational institutions with 19 wings offering courses from pre-school to doctoral levels. The Vidyalaya was established in 1930 in the suburbs of Coimbatore, India, and affiliated to Ramakrishna Mission in 1934. Ramakrishna Mission's official General Reports start giving reports of its activities from 1936.
The Vidyalaya strives to infuse the educational and spiritual ideas of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda into the daily lives of its students. Values such as self-reliance, self-control, patriotism and dedication to duty are taught in practical ways. A band of monks and brahmacharis of the Ramakrishna Order manage the activities of the Vidyalaya assisted by teaching and non-teaching staff.
History.
Ramakrishna Mission Vidyalaya was founded by Sri T.S. Avinashilingam in 1930 with an investment of Rs. 5.75 and with one harijan boy on its roll. While studying in college, Sri T.S.Avinashilingam met Swami Shivananda, a direct disciple of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna whose famous disciple was Swami Vivekananda. It was from Vivekananda that Shivananda absorbed the idea of the prime importance of education for the revival of India. The 'sacred touch' of Swami Shivananda, as Sri Avinashilingam later described it, awoke in him the vision for his future mission in the field of education. Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation, laid the foundation stone of the Vidyalaya in 1934 and wished that the students of the Vidyalaya would be intensely patriotic followers of truth. The Vidyalaya was affiliated to Ramakrishna Mission in the same year.
Campus.
Vidyalaya is located 19 km from the city of Coimbatore on the highway to Ooty. The campus is spread over nearly 300 acres of wooded land. It is home to hundreds of bird species including peacocks.
Institutions.
Special Institutions.
The Polytechnic institute embodies the ethos and values of the Ramakrishna Misison. The Ramakrishna Mission strives to infuse the educational and spiritual ideas of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda into the daily lives of its students. Values such as self-reliance, self-control, patriotism and dedication to duty are taught in practical ways.
The courses offered are Diploma In Information Technology, Diploma In Civil Engineering, Diploma In Mechanical Engineering and Diploma In Electrical and Electronics Engineering.
Social services.
The Swami Akhandananda Rural Development Scheme started in 2002. Under this scheme, Arivoli Nagar and other rural areas are provided with tuitions and medical services.
Notable events.
Apart from technical seminars and workshops, Vidyalaya is known for the following events:
Guru Puja.
Guru puja, the public celebration of the birthday of Bhagavan Sri Ramakrishna, is the most important cultural activity of Vidyalaya and is celebrated every year on the first Sunday of January. The day long celebration includes bhajans, talks by personalities, drama, educational exhibition, music and cultural programmes. The highlight of the function is Maheswara Puja in which around 40,000 people are given a sumptuous feast.

NBR C Class

The NBR C Class (LNER Class J36) is a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotive designed by Matthew Holmes for freight work on the North British Railway. They were introduced in 1888 and had inside cylinders and Stephenson valve gear. A total of 168 locomotives was built, of which 123 came into British Railways ownership at nationalisation in 1948. This was the last class of steam engine in service in Scotland.
Technical information.
As built they had a saturated (non-superheated) boiler at ( for the last 24) and Stephenson valve gear with slide valves. Between 1913 and 1923 the class was rebuilt with bigger boilers set at 165 psi and the Reid side-window cab.
Ownership.
NBR.
After the introduction of the Drummond Class C (LNER Class J32) 18-inch (cylinder diameter) 0-6-0s, essentially for the Waverley Route in 1876, the NBR reverted to the 17-inch design with the Drummond Class D (J34) in 1879 and the Holmes Class D (J33) in 1883. 
With the opening of the second Tay Bridge in July 1887 and the upcoming opening of the Forth Bridge in March 1890 the NBR needed more powerful goods locos. The result was the Holmes Class C (J36). Introduced in 1888 it was built in regular batches until 1900, eventually totalling 168 locos. 138 were built at the NBR's Cowlairs Works while the other 30 were split equally between Neilson and Company and Sharp, Stewart and Company. 
During the First World War 25 of the class were sent to France for service with the Railway Operating Division. On return to Scotland they were given names of battles, generals and a cartoon soldier in recognition of their service. The names were hand-painted on the splasher above the middle driving wheel so often disappeared during repaints.
LNER.
On 1 January 1923 all 168 locos passed into the hands of the LNER and became Class J36. As with all ex-NBR locos they had 9000 added to their number. The final 8 unrebuilt locos were rebuilt in 1923. In 1937 locomotives 9714 and 9716 (later 5285 and 5287) were rebuilt with cutdown chimney and dome for use on the Gartverrie Branch. In 1946 the remaining locos were renumbered from 5210 to 5346. A number of locos had tender cabs fitted for use with snow ploughs.
BR.
On 1 January 1948 at nationalisation, 123 locos passed into the hands of British Railways and had 60000 added to their number. On 5 June 1967 65288 of Dunfermline (62C) and 65345 of Thornton (62A) were withdrawn. They were the last steam locomotives in service in Scotland.
Preservation.
One, 673 "Maude" (LNER number 9673; LNER 1946 number 5243; BR number 65243) has been preserved by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society at the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway.
Trivia.
65288 was adopted by Dunfermline High School Railway Society and was repainted by society members while still in BR service [http://andycarr.net/page20.htm]. It was fitted with one small and one normal sized buffer at the front end.

Antoni Tàpies

Antoni Tàpies i Puig, 1st Marquess of Tàpies (; 13 December 1923 – 6 February 2012) was a Spanish painter, sculptor and art theorist, who became one of the most famous European artists of his generation.
Life.
The son of Josep Tàpies i Mestre and Maria Puig i Guerra, Antoni Tàpies Puig was born in Barcelona on December 13, 1923. His father was a lawyer and Catalan nationalist who served briefly with the Republican government. At 17, Tàpies suffered a near-fatal heart attack caused by tuberculosis. He spent two years as a convalescent in the mountains, reading widely and pursuing an interest in art that had already expressed itself when he was in his early teens.
Tàpies studied at the German School of Barcelona. After studying law for 3 years, he devoted himself from 1943 onwards only to his painting. He lived mainly in Barcelona and was represented by the Galerie Lelong in Paris and the Pace Gallery in New York. Tàpies died in early February 2012. He was 88.
Work.
Tàpies was perhaps the best-known Catalan artist to emerge in the period since the Second World War. He first came into contact with contemporary art as a teenager through the magazine "D’Ací i D’Allà", published in Barcelona, and during the Spanish Civil War (1936–9), while he was still at school, he taught himself to draw and paint. On a French government scholarship in the early 1950s he lived in Paris, to which he often returned. Both in Europe and beyond, the highly influential French critic and curator Michel Tapié enthusiastically promoted the work of Antoni Tàpies.
In 1948, Tàpies helped co-found the first Post-War Movement in Spain known as "Dau al Set" which was connected to the Surrealist and Dadaist Movements. The main leader and founder of "Dau al Set" was the poet Joan Brossa. The movement also had a publication of the same name, "Dau al Set". Tàpies started as a surrealist painter, his early works were influenced by Paul Klee and Joan Miró; but soon become an informal artist, working in a style known as "pintura matèrica", in which non artistic materials are incorporated into the paintings. In 1953 he began working in mixed media; this is considered his most original contribution to art. One of the first to create serious art in this way, he added clay and marble dust to his paint and used waste paper, string, and rags (Grey and Green Painting, Tate Gallery, London, 1957).
Tàpies' international reputation was well established by the end of the 1950s. From the late 1950s to early 1960s, Tàpies worked with Enrique Tábara, Antonio Saura, Manolo Millares and many other Spanish Informalist artists. In 1966 he was arrested at a clandestine assembly at the University of Barcelona; his work of the early 1970s is marked by symbols of Catalan identity (which was anathema to Franco). In 1974 he made a series of lithographs called "Assassins" and displayed them in the Galerie Maeght in Paris, in honour of regime critic Salvador Puig Antich's memory. From about 1970 (influenced by Pop art) he began incorporating more substantial objects into his paintings, such as parts of furniture. Tàpies's ideas have had worldwide influence on art, especially in the realms of painting, sculpture, etchings and lithography. Examples of his work are found in numerous major international collections. His work is associated with both Tachisme and Abstract Expressionism.
The paintings produced by Tàpies, later in the 1970s and in the 1980s, reveal his application of this aesthetic of meditative emptiness, for example in spray-painted canvases with linear elements suggestive of Oriental calligraphy, in mixed-media paintings that extended the vocabulary of Art informel, and in his oblique allusions to imagery within a fundamentally abstract idiom, as in "Imprint of a Basket on Cloth" (1980). Among the artists' work linked in style to that of Tàpies is that of the American painter Julian Schnabel as both have been connected to the art term "Matter".
Graphic work.
Alongside his production of pictures and objects, from 1947 onward Tàpies was active in the field of graphic work. He produced a large number of collector’s books and dossiers in close association with poets and writers such as Alberti, Bonnefoy, Du Bouchet, Brodsky, Brossa, Daive, Dupin, Foix, Frémon, Gimferrer, Guillén, Jabès, Mestres Quadreny, Mitscherlich, Paz, Saramago, Takiguchi, Ullán, Valente and Zambrano.
Essays.
Tàpies has written essays which have been collected in a series of publications, some translated into different languages: "La pràctica de l’art" (1970), "L’art contra l’estètica", (1974), "Memòria personal" (1978), "La realitat com a art" (1982), "Per un art modern i progressista" (1985), "Valor de l’art (1993)" and "L’art i els seus llocs" (1999).
Exhibitions.
In 1950, Tàpies' first solo show was held at the Galeries Laietanes, Barcelona, and he was included in the Carnegie International in Pittsburgh. In 1953 he had his first shows in the United States, at the Marshall Field Art Gallery in Chicago and the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. His first retrospective exhibitions were presented at the Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, in 1973 and at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York, in 1977. Later he was the subject of retrospective exhibitions at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 1994, kestnergesellschaft in Hannover in 1998, and at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid in 2000.
Legacy.
In 1984, Tàpies created the Tàpies Foundation, dedicated to the study of modern art. In 1990 it opened a museum and library in the premises of a former publishing house in Barcelona. Its holdings include nearly 2,000 examples of his work.
Recognition.
Tàpies was awarded in 1958 the First Prize for painting at the Pittsburgh International, and the UNESCO and David E. Bright Prizes at the Venice Biennale. He received the Rubens Prize of Siegen, Germany, in 1972. On 9 April 2010, he was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos I with the hereditary title of Marqués de Tàpies (English: Marquess of Tàpies). In the Academic Sphere, he received an Honorary Doctorate from the Rovira i Virgili University in 1994. Furthermore, he designed Rovira i Virgili University’s logo, which is characterized by the letter “a”, symbol of universal’s knowledge principle.

Ortuella

Ortuella is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Autonomous Community of Basque Country, northern Spain.
Nowadays part of Greater Bilbao region, until the beginning of 19th century it was integrated in the Valley of Somorrostro of the Encartaciones next to the Santurtzi. In 1901 the locality segregated from the Council of the Santurtzi, those days happening to denominate the Santurce-Ortuella. This segregation was motivated by an increase of population due to the mining height of end of 19th century, being the district of Ortuella the one of greater population in the Council. In the 1980s, and by means of the resolution of March 27, 1981, the name of the municipality definitively lost the term " Santurce", simply being " Ortuella", which was the ususual name used by their citizens.
The patron saint of Ortuella is Saint Felix of Cantalica (May 18), name of the main church of the municipality.
Neighborhoods.
Ortuella is administratively divided into 6 neighborhoods or wards:

Christian Frederik Hansen

Christian Frederik Hansen (29 February 1756 – 10 July 1845), known as C.F. Hansen, was the leading Danish architect between the late 18th century and the mid 19th century, and on account of his position at the Royal Danish Academy of Art ("Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi") the most powerful person in artistic circles for many years. He was known as "Denmark’s Palladio" on account of the architectural style he promoted. His buildings are known for their simplicity, strength and scale.
Upbringing and training.
He was born in Copenhagen into the poor household of shoemaker and leatherworker Matthias Hansen and his wife Anna Marie, who had been nursemaid for Prince Christian VII. He was the youngest son in the family, and there was not much money to spend on his upbringing. His parents sent him to train in business, but he wanted to draw. His mother used her connections at the royal court, and found some influential people who interested themselves in his education and training.
He was brought into training as a bricklayer, and at the same time he attended classes at the Academy of Art starting in 1766. He studied at the Academy under architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff, but probably also received some training from Nicolas-Henri Jardin. He won the Academy’s small silver medallion in 1772-1773, the large silver medallion in 1774-1775, and the large gold medallion in 1779.
Career start.
He was taken into Harsdorff's private studio where he worked on the construction of Frederik V's chapel at Roskilde Cathedral in 1780.
He received no travel grant from the Academy, in spite of his receiving the gold medallion. Instead he received economic support from Dowager Queen Juliane Marie and King Christian VII for a shorter tour, and he traveled out of the country starting in late 1782, travelling over Vienna and Venice to Rome, where he studied ancient Roman art. His student drawings from the trip are kept in the Academy’s Library to this day.
He returned home September 1784, and became a member of the Academy in 1785.
18 years in Altona.
Shortly afterwards he was named to the position of Regional Architect for the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, with residence in Altona, a position for which he had applied in 1782. He held this position from 24 November 1784 until his retirement on 31 October 1844.
He was named titular Professor at the Academy in 1791. In 1792 he married Anne Margrethe Rahbek.
He prospered during his 18 years in Altona and Hamburg, with a private practice that made up for the meager earnings he made in his official position. He built fine houses for the well-to-do, both in town and out in the country, estates, and small churches. He designed many fine houses along Altona's elegant boulevard Palmaillen, including some investment houses at his own expense, which helped boost his earnings substantially when sold. He used a simple Roman Palladio-style in his work.
When Harsdorff died in 1799 a number of public building projects were transferred to Hansen, among these the completion of Frederik's Church, also known as The Marble Church ("Marmorkirken") in Copenhagen.
Return to Copenhagen.
He returned to Copenhagen in 1804, where he lived until his death. He had a large, social household in a fabulously appointed apartment in Copenhagen. In 1808 he was named Professor of Architecture, Chief Building Director, and given the position of State Advisor ("etatsråd"). He held the title of Chief Building Director until his retirement.
Hansen was responsible for the building of the City Hall and Courthouse on Nytorv (1805–1815), and the rebuilding of Church of Our Lady ("Vor Frue Kirke") along with the surrounding square (1811–1829), after the church was burned down during the bombing of the second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807.
He overtook Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard's leading position at the Academy, and was chosen eight times as Director of the Academy, 1811–1818, 1821–1827, and 1830-1833.
He was responsible for the Town Hall and Court Building at the site of the old Waisenhus, which was completed in 1815. That same year Metropolitan School was completed on Frue Plads.
The other major work he did was the rebuilding of Christiansborg Palace, which had burned down during the fire of 1794. The chapel was completed in 1826, and the rest of the building was completed in 1828.
In 1823 his church in Hørsholm, on the site of the former Hirschholm Palace, was dedicated. In 1826 he was named ‘’Konferensråd’’. In 1830 he established a medallion to be given to young architects. He became titled with the Order of the Dannebrog in 1840.
His marble bust of sculptor Hermann Ernst Freund is in the Academy’s Assembly Hall, as is his portrait of artist Conrad Christian August Bøhndel.
He died at his home in Frederiksberg at the age of nearly 90, and is buried in the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen.

Pitchstone

Pitchstone is a dull black glassy volcanic rock formed when viscous lava or magma cools quickly. It is similar to but coarser than obsidian. It is a volcanic glass with a conchoidal fracture (like glass), a resinous lustre, or silky in some cases, and a variable composition. Its colour may be mottled, streaked, or uniform brown, red, green, gray, or black. It is an extrusive rock that is very resistant to erosion. 
The pitchstone ridge of An Sgùrr on the Isle of Eigg, Scotland, was originally formed as a lava flow in a valley.

Otxandio

Otxandio (in Basque and officially, in Spanish "Ochandiano") is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Basque autonomous community, Spain. Otxandio is part of the "comarca" of Durangaldea and has a population of 1.269 inhabitants as of 2010 according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute.
Toponymy.
The name of the town is documented for the first time in the 12th century. However, it would not be considered a town until the 18th century. The name in Spanish, "Ochandiano" is an anthroponym formed by a name and the "-ano" suffix, of Latin origin, probably from the evolution of the suffix "-anum". The origin of the word seems to come from the Basque words "Ochoa Handia", that may be translated as "big wolf". 
The name in Basque, "Otxandio" comes from the phonetic evolution of the Spanish variation, Ochandiano, given due the loss of the intervocalic "n"; from "Ochandiano" to "Ochandiao" and then "Ochandio". Then, the adaptation to the Basque ortographic rules changes "Ochandio" to "Otxandio". 
Since 1984, the official name of the municipality is Otxandio.
Geography.
Otxandio serves during centuries as the port of entry of Biscay from Álava. It is located at the southernmost part of the province and limits with Abadiño at north, Dima at north and west, Ubide at southwest and the province of Álava at south.

Nobuo Fujita

Early life and military career.
Nobuo Fujita joined the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1932 and became a pilot in 1933. Fujita also had a younger brother who was killed in the war.
Pearl Harbor and U.S. West Coast.
Fujita was on board "I-25" during the attack on Pearl Harbor, where the "I-25" and three other submarines patrolled a line north of Oahu. Fujita's plane, a Yokosuka E14Y "Glen" seaplane, did not function properly, and he was unable to participate in the reconnaissance mission planned before the attack.
After the attack on Pearl Harbor, "I-25" patrolled along the West Coast of the United States with eight other submarines. They attacked U.S. shipping before returning to their base in Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. They arrived there on January 11, 1942 to refuel and be refurbished.
South Pacific.
"I-25"s next mission was to reconnoitre the Australian harbours of Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, followed by the New Zealand harbours of Wellington and Auckland. On 17 February 1942, Nobuo Fujita took off in the "Glen" for a reconnaissance flight over Sydney Harbour to examine the city's airbase. By 07:30, he had returned to "I-25", disassembled the "Glen" and stowed it in the water-tight hangar.
The next mission was a similar flight over Melbourne, Australia. Fujita took off from Cape Wickham on King Island at the western end of Bass Strait, about halfway between Victoria and Tasmania. The floatplane was launched on 26 February for its flight to Melbourne over Port Phillip Bay.
Fujita's next reconnaissance flight in Australia was over Hobart on 1 March. "I-25" then headed for New Zealand, where Fujita flew a reconnaissance flight over Wellington on 8 March. He flew over Auckland on 13 March, followed by Fiji on 17 March. The submarine returned to its base at Kwajalein on 31 March.
Pacific Northwest.
On 28 May, Fujita performed a reconnaissance of Kodiak, Alaska in preparation for the invasion of the Aleutian Islands. On 21 June, "I-25" shelled the U. S. base of Fort Stevens, near Astoria, Oregon. Fujita was on the deck of "I-25" during the attack.
Bombing continental United States.
Fujita himself suggested the idea of a submarine-based seaplane to bomb military targets, including ships at sea, and attacks on the U.S. mainland, especially the strategic Panama Canal. The idea was approved, and the mission was given to "I-25". Submarine aircraft carriers such as the giant "I-400"-class submarines would be developed specifically to bomb the Panama Canal.
At 06:00 on 9 September, "I-25" surfaced west of the Oregon/California border where she launched the "Glen", flown by Fujita and Petty Officer Okuda Shoji, with a load of two incendiary bombs. Fujita dropped two bombs, one on Wheeler Ridge on Mount Emily in Oregon. The location of the other bomb is unknown. The Wheeler Ridge bomb started a small fire due east of Brookings, which U.S. Forest Service employees were able to extinguish. Rain the night before had made the forest very damp, and the bombs were rendered essentially ineffective. Fujita's plane had been spotted by two men, Howard Gardner and Bob Larson, at the Mount Emily fire lookout tower in the Siskiyou National Forest. Two other lookouts (the Chetco Point Lookout and the Long Ridge Lookout) reported the plane, but could not see it due to heavy fog. The plane was seen and heard by many people, especially when Fujita flew over Brookings in both directions. At about noon that day, Howard Gardner at the Mount Emily Lookout reported seeing smoke. The four U.S. Forest Service employees discovered that the fire was caused by a Japanese bomb. Approximately of fragments, including the nose of the bomb, were turned over to the United States Army.
After the bombing, "I-25" came under attack by a USAAF aircraft on patrol, forcing the submarine to dive and hide on the ocean floor off Port Orford. The American attacks caused only minor damage, and Fujita flew a second bombing sortie three weeks later on 29 September. Fujita used the Cape Blanco Light as a beacon. After 90 minutes flying east, he dropped his bombs and reported seeing flames, but the bombing remained unnoticed in the U.S.
The submarine torpedoed and sank the "SS Camden" and "SS Larry Doheny", and then sailed for home. On its way to Japan, "I-25" sank the Soviet submarine "L-16", which was in transit between Dutch Harbor, Alaska and San Francisco, California, mistaking it for an American submarine (Japan and the USSR were not at war at the time).
The two attacks on Oregon in September 1942 were the only World War II aircraft bombings on the continental United States.
Later life.
Fujita continued as an Imperial Japanese Navy pilot, mainly in reconnaissance duties, until 1944, when he was transferred to the training of "kamikaze" pilots. After the war he opened a hardware store in Ibaraki Prefecture, and later worked at a company making wire.
Fujita was invited to Brookings in 1962, after the Japanese government was assured he would not be tried as a war criminal. He gave the City of Brookings his family's 400-year-old samurai sword in friendship. Ashamed of his actions during the war, Fujita had intended to use the sword to commit seppuku if he were given a hostile reception. However the town treated him with respect and affection, although his visit still raised some controversy.
Impressed by his welcome in the United States, Fujita invited three female students from Brookings to Japan in 1985. During the visit of the Brookings-Harbor High School students to Japan, Fujita received a dedicatory letter from an aide of President Ronald Reagan "with admiration for your kindness and generosity."
Fujita returned to Brookings in 1990, 1992, and 1995. In 1992, he planted a tree at the bomb site as a gesture of peace. In 1995, he moved the samurai sword from the Brookings City Hall into the new library's display case.
Honorary citizenship and death.
He was made an honorary citizen of Brookings several days before his death at a hospital in Tsuchiura, Japan on September 30, 1997, at the age of 85.
In October 1998, his daughter, Yoriko Asakura, buried some of Fujita's ashes at the bomb site.

Elephant Parts (comic)

Elephant Parts was a short-lived British adult comic from the 1990s, similar in tone and content to Gas comic, only with a cruder layout and a willfully "amateurish" feel overall. 
The most notable strip was Charlie Brooker's "Horny Estelle", which told the story of various twenty-something losers and their unrequited love for the title character, a blonde baggage who was allegedly insatiable. Similar in tone to Peter Bagge's "Hate" comics and employing similarly exaggerated drawings, the strip was indicative of the level of humour to be found in the magazine.

Parametric model

In statistics, a parametric model or parametric family or finite-dimensional model is a family of distributions that can be described using a finite number of parameters. These parameters are usually collected together to form a single "k"-dimensional "parameter vector" "θ" = ("θ"1, "θ"2, …, "θ""k"). 
Parametric models are contrasted with the semi-parametric, semi-nonparametric, and non-parametric models, all of which consist of an infinite set of “parameters” for description. The distinction between these four classes is as follows:
Some statisticians believe that the concepts “parametric”, “non-parametric”, and “semi-parametric” are ambiguous. It can also be noted that the set of all probability measures has cardinality of continuum, and therefore it is possible to parametrize any model at all by a single number in (0,1) interval. This difficulty can be avoided by considering only “smooth” parametric models.
Definition.
A parametric model is a collection of probability distributions such that each member of this collection, "Pθ", is described by a finite-dimensional parameter "θ". The set of all allowable values for the parameter is denoted Θ ⊆ R"k", and the model itself is written as
When the model consists of absolutely continuous distributions, it is often specified in terms of corresponding probability density functions:
The parametric model is called identifiable if the mapping "θ" ↦ "Pθ" is invertible, that is there are no two different parameter values "θ"1 and "θ"2 such that "P""θ"1 = "P""θ"2.
Regular parametric model.
Let "μ" be a fixed σ-finite measure on a probability space (Ω, ℱ), and formula_3 the collection of all probability measures dominated by "μ". Then we will call  formula_4  a regular parametric model if the following requirements are met:

Plentzia (Plencia in Spanish) is a town and municipality located in the province of Biscay, in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (Euskal Herria). The town has 4,146 inhabitants (2008). 
Plentzia is located 27 km north-east of Bilbao. It is part of the Greater Bilbao metropolitan area, as well as being the terminus of the first line of the city's Metro. In addition to the Metro, two BizkaiBus bus routes serve the town, with further destinations served from Urduliz, the next stop on the Metro.
Plentzia is a resort town with a large beach beside the Plentzia River estuary, in the round, shell-shaped Bay of Plentzia, shared with neighbouring Gorliz and Barrika. The beach is very popular as it is clean and the sea is calm due to the shelter of the bay and the town has a lot of amenities for visitors.
Plentzia and its neighbouring municipalities are popular locations for better-off families from Bilbao to buy weekend–holiday homes and during the summer months the town's beach and bars and restaurants become much busier thanks to these residents and other visitors from Bilbao.
As in most Basque towns, Plentzia has a number of restaurants and bars ranging from small bars offering "Pintxos" to restaurants with formal dining. There is also a small Council-run museum telling the town's history and in particular dealing with its history as a merchant marine port. The town also has an indoor municipal Jai Alai Fronton where the traditional Basque sport of pelota is played and competitive matches can often be seen.

Santurtzi

Santurtzi (; ) is a port town in the province of Biscay, in the autonomous community of Basque Country, Spain. It is located in the Bilbao Abra bay, near the mouth of the Nervión river, on its left bank, 14km downriver from Bilbao and forms part of the "Greater Bilbao" agglomeration. It has a population of 47,320 (2006) and a land area of 6.77 km².
The district of Santurce of the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico derives its name from Santurtzi.
Geography.
Santurtzi has a very rough orography although excluding "Mount Serantes" (452m) - one of its most symbolic topographic elements, it is not at high altitude, the significant heights being spurs of the Serantes: "The Mallet" (245m) and the "Fortified heights" (123 and 106m). Its relief is within the north flank of the anticline of Biscay. It is a relief of a structural type corresponding to a series of materials of the Cretaceous period (limestone) throughout Punta Lucero-Serantes smoothly inclined towards the Estuary of Bilbao.
The climate in Santurtzi is of the humid oceanic climate type. The temperatures are moderate throughout the year, with more frequent rains in spring and autumn, winters are benign and summers not excessively warm. The average temperature is 20°C (70ªF) in summer and 8°C (48ªF) in winter.
Tourism.
The beauty of the landscape and the quality of the gastronomy along with the hospitality of the "Santurtziarrak" are some of the attractions which the visitor can enjoy. 
Santurtzi is a marine town that has succeeded in conserving many of its traditions, in spite of its great growth. 
The life in this area is focused on the sea, which inspires its work and its leisure. Fishing boat and rowing boat races, and the celebrations of the Virgin of the Carmen keep their traditions alive. 
Gastronomy is based on fish, especially sardines.

Wanda Beach Murders

The Wanda Beach Murders refers to the case of the unsolved murders of Marianne Schmidt and Christine Sharrock at Wanda Beach near Sydney on 11 January 1965. Their partially buried bodies were discovered the next day.
The victims, both aged 15, were best friends and neighbours. The brutal nature of the slayings and the fact that the twin killings occurred on a deserted, windswept beach brought publicity to the case. It remains one of the most infamous unsolved Australian murder cases of the 1960s, perhaps second in notoriety only to the disappearance of the Beaumont children.
The Victims.
Marianne Schmidt.
Marianne Schmidt had arrived in Melbourne from West Germany with her family in September 1958. At the time, the Schmidt family consisted of parents Helmut and Elizabeth and Marianne's siblings, Helmut Jr., Hans, Peter, Trixie and Wolfgang. Another child, Norbert, was born in Australia the following year. After arriving in Australia, the Schmidts lived in a migrant hostel in Unanderra before settling in Temora. In 1963 Helmut Schmidt moved the family to Sydney after contracting Hodgkin's disease and they found a home in the suburb of Ryde. In June the next year, Helmut Schmidt died.
Marianne's next-door neighbour was Christine Sharrock.
Christine Sharrock.
Christine Sharrock lived with her grandparents Jim and Jeanette Taig. Her father died in 1958 and her mother Beryl remarried and was living in the north-western Sydney suburb of Seven Hills. Christine moved in with her grandparents by choice and when the Schmidts arrived next-door she developed a strong friendship with Marianne, who was the same age.
Last movements and Murder.
Disappearance.
On 1 January 1965, Christine and Marianne visited the beach at Cronulla, which had been a popular picnic spot for the Schmidts. The following day the Schmidt children visited the beach there again without Christine. Elizabeth Schmidt had meanwhile been admitted to hospital for a major operation, leaving Helmut Jr and Marianne in charge of the household. On 9 January, Marianne and Christine asked Elizabeth if they could take the younger children to Cronulla the next day and were given permission; however, rain prevented the trip.
On Monday 11 January, accompanied by Marianne’s youngest four siblings, the girls again set off for Cronulla. They arrived at about 11am, but it was very windy and the beach was closed. The group therefore walked down to the southern end of the beach and sheltered among the rocks. Eight-year old Wolfgang Schmidt still wanted to swim however, so Marianne went with him to a shallow part of the surf away from the rocks. After they returned to the group, they had a picnic. At some point during this time, Christine left the others and went off by herself. There is no evidence of her whereabouts during this period, but after her death it was discovered she had consumed alcohol and some food that was different from the rest of the party; it is suspected this occurred while she was alone. It was also during this time that Wolfgang noticed a boy hunting crabs. Later, he claimed to have seen the same boy twice more, once in the company of his sister and Christine and again sometime much later. There has been doubt about his description of this person, as Wolfgang variously suggested he had a homemade speargun, a knife, or both.
When Christine returned to the group, it was decided to take a walk into the sandhills behind Wanda Beach. Around 1pm, the group had reached a point around 400 metres beyond the Wanda Surf Club, they stopped to shelter behind a sandhill as the younger children were complaining about the conditions. Marianne told her younger siblings that she and Christine would return to the rocky area at the south end of the beach where they had hidden their bags, then return to fetch the children and head home. Instead, however, the girls continued into the sandhills. When Peter Schmidt told them they were going the wrong way, they laughed at him and walked on.
The Schmidt children remained waiting behind the sandhill until 5pm. They returned to collect their bags and then went home. The girls were reported missing at 8:30pm.
Last sighting.
The last official sighting of Marianne and Christine was by local fireman Dennis Dostine, who was walking in the area with his son and saw the girls walking about 800 yards north of the surf club. He told police that they seemed to be hurrying, and one of the girls was looking behind her as if she were being followed. Dostine did not see anybody else.
Bodies discovered.
On Tuesday, 12 January Peter Smith was taking his three young nephews for a walk through the Wanda Beach sandhills. Some distance north of the surf club, he discovered what appeared to be a department store mannequin buried in the sand. He brushed away sand from the hand and realised that it was a body. The police were called from the surf club, however at this point Smith believed he had found only one young woman.
When the bodies were uncovered, Marianne Schmidt was found lying on her right side with her left leg bent. Christine Sharrock was face down, her head against the sole of Schmidt's left foot. From a 34-metre long drag mark leading to the scene, police determined that Sharrock had fled, possibly while Schmidt was dying, only to have been caught, murdered and dragged back to the body of her friend. Attempts had been made to rape both girls. Sharrock's skull had been fractured by a blow to the back of the head and she had been stabbed multiple times. Schmidt's throat had been slashed and she too had been stabbed several times.
Investigation.
A large police investigation failed to identify the killer. There had been a number of people seen in the area who were never identified; Sydney in 1965 was a conservative place and the area around Wanda Beach attracted a range of people, who did not necessarily want to identify themselves to police. This frustrated the police investigation. In February 2012, however, the NSW Police's Cold Case Unit announced that a weak male DNA sample had been extracted from a pair of jeans worn by one of the girls. While admitting that current technology was unable to provide more information, police were confident that future advances would give more assistance.[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-02-27/dna-advances-may-solve-cold-case-murders/3855916]
Linked cases.
Two murders occurred during early 1966 which, police at the time speculated, might have been the work of the Wanda Beach killer.
Suspects.
Cec Johnson, a former detective who had investigated the Wanda Beach murders, was given a painting in 1975 by Alan Bassett. Bassett had been jailed for murdering Carolyn Orphin, a 19 year old woman, in June 1966. Sent to prison for life, he served 29 years before being released in 1995.
The painting that Bassett gave Johnson showed an abstract landscape. Looking at the picture, however, Johnson became convinced that it showed a scene from the Wanda Beach murders that only the killer would know, as well as clues to the murders of Kruger and Dowlingkoa. The painting was believed by Johnson to show blood trails, a broken knife blade and the body of a victim. He became convinced that Bassett was the Wanda Beach killer. Other detectives were far less convinced, but Johnson wrote a book about the case. Before it could be published, however, he was knocked down and killed in an accident. The book was never published. Other detectives, while retaining professional respect for Johnson, concluded that he was wrong in his belief that Bassett was the killer.
One person he convinced, however, was crime reporter Bill Jenkings. Jenkings repeated Johnson’s claims in his ghostwritten memoirs, "As Crime Goes By," devoting a whole chapter to the Wanda Beach murders. Most of the chapter was essentially a repeat of what he’d written in his earlier book "Crime Reporter," but he mentioned Johnson, Bassett and the painting as well. Bassett threatened legal action, but Jenkings died shortly afterwards, and Bassett did not go through with his threat. Since his release, Bassett has voluntarily given a DNA sample to clear his name, but whether or not he has been eliminated as a suspect by DNA has yet to be publicised.
Another suspect is Christopher Wilder. Two years prior to the Wanda beach murders he had been convicted of a gang-rape on a Sydney beach which led police to include him as a suspect for Wanda beach. Wilder emigrated to the United States in 1969 and later become infamous after he became a serial killer in the early 1980s. In the first half of 1984, he committed eight murders and attempted several more. He accidentally killed himself during a struggle with police in New Hampshire on 13 April 1984.
A third suspect, not well publicised until 1998, is Derek Percy. Percy has been imprisoned since 1969 for the murder of a child on a beach in Victoria. He was considered too dangerous to be released and is the prime suspect for a number of other murders of children in Melbourne and Sydney. Derek Percy died 24 July 2013 from cancer. While Percy can be linked to the location on the date of the murders there were no other links found. It was hoped he would make confessions on his deathbed but these confessions never came. Percy is considered a leading suspect for Wanda beach by the police.
None of the three suspects fit the description of the youth seen talking to the girls by witnesses. This person has never been identified.
The case was reopened as a cold case in 2007 and in 2012 blood from a possible knife wipe mark found on the clothing of one of the girls was identified as that of a male but DNA testing could learn nothing more from the sample. Police are optimistic that future improvements in DNA technology will eventually identify the killer.
Media.
The murders were the focus of the "Crime Investigation Australia" season 1 episode "The Wanda Beach Murders".

The Leamside Line (originally part of the Durham Junction Railway) is a railway line in the North East of England, branching off from the main East Coast Main Line (ECML) at Tursdale in County Durham, and continuing north through Washington and Wardley, finally joining the Newcastle upon Tyne to Sunderland line at Pelaw.
It is currently out of use, having been mothballed by British Rail in 1991 after the closure of the Freightliner freight terminal at Follingsby, near Washington, which was the recipient of most of the line's traffic in its last years. A short section of the line from Pelaw Junction remained in operation for a number of years, serving the open-cast coal mine at Wardley, but this too has now closed.
History.
The first section of the line was opened by the Durham Junction Railway on 24 August 1838 between Washington, on the Stanhope & Tyne Railway, and Rainton Meadows. The Newcastle & Darlington Junction Railway bought the railway in 1843 and used it as part of its route between Darlington and Newcastle from 18 June 1844. Trains traveled via until the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway, the successor of the Newcastle & Darlington Junction, opened the direct line between Washington and Pelaw on 1 September 1849.
The stone arch Victoria Viaduct over the river Wear is inspired by the design of the Alcántara Bridge in Spain, with The rails pass over the valley, carried on four arches, two of span , and two of span . It constituted part of the original East Coast Main Line route from Edinburgh to London, eventually being incorporated into the North Eastern Railway. The line's main source of revenue, as with most of the early railways, was mineral traffic, principally coal from the Durham coalfield. The line was linked to many private colliery branch lines and wagonways.
During the line's period of operation, passenger stations served were: Usworth; Washington; Penshaw; Fencehouses; Leamside; Sherburn; and Shincliffe.
The line was part of the east coast main line until 1872 when the route was bypassed by the NER's Bishop Auckland to Gateshead line and Croxdale link, which became part of the ECML. Thereafter it continued to carry local passenger services and freight traffic, as well as serving as a useful diversionary route from the ECML. Passenger services between Leamside and Ferryhill were withdrawn in 1941 and Leamside station closed in 1953. The last regular passenger service was withdrawn in May 1964 as part of the infamous Beeching Axe although, in its latter days, this had only consisted of an early morning 'newspaper' train from Newcastle to Fencehouses and Durham only and a single workers' return service from Newcastle to Washington on Mondays to Fridays. Coal and other freight continued to be carried until the gradual closure of the Durham coalfield in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in a severe drop in the line's traffic. It was mothballed in 1991.
South of Victoria Viaduct, the line merged with the direct Durham to Sunderland Line for a short distance. This also fell to the Beeching Axe in 1964.
The line today.
After mothballing, the double track was reduced to a single line in some places, and the track was severed at some level crossings along the line. Initially, its engineering features remained intact but the embankment which carries the line over Moors Burn, 500 yards to the north of the site of Fencehouses station, had partially collapsed, leaving the former down track suspended.()
Part of the Durham to Sunderland line that left the Leamside Line near the south-east end of the Victoria Viaduct was brought back into use in 2002 for the Sunderland Extension of the Tyne and Wear Metro, terminating at South Hylton, around 3 miles from the former junction with the Leamside Line.
Around one mile (1.6 km) of track to the south of Penshaw was stolen in 2003 and would have had to be replaced if the line were to eventually reopen. This theft, which took place over a six-day period using a gang of workers who were unaware that the work was illegal, substantially raised the costs of reopening the route.
Substantial parts of the line and infrastructure were also missing from around the former Usworth station which also became severely overgrown.
Re-opening plans.
On 4 December 2006, Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority announced that it had commissioned a study into the future use of the line, with a view to possible re-opening as a suburban railway linking into the local transport network. The next day, it was announced that Network Rail had also signed up to the study, although current plans for removal of the track "(see below)" would still proceed. The study concluded in 2008 that the most appropriate use of the line would be to carry a regional service linking the Tees Valley and Tyne and Wear regions, with the highest level of wider economic benefits achieved by minimising the journey time between the end points, rather than serving a large number of intermediate stations. According to the report, passenger demand would be great enough to produce a farebox revenue of over £2 million per year. Such a service would also allow scope for freight trains to operate.
The line had been briefly considered in 2000 for reopening by Railtrack as a diversionary freight route to take the burden from the congested ECML. A number of studies have advocated re-opening the line, for example The vision for passenger rail services in the Tees Valley. Re-opening the line would provide economic benefits to areas depressed since the demise of the coal mining industry. However, these plans were put on hold.
Durham County Council's Local Transport Plan (LTP) indicates that the Council supports passenger traffic return to the Leamside Line, and would promote the service. See Railwatch for more details.
If the Leamside line is opened to passenger traffic, it would lead to the reopening of several railway stations along the route. The Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions has expressed concern at the delays in determining the future of this line.
On 15 June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) included Washington as one of a number of towns in the UK that would benefit from the resinstatement of existing rail links that were closed or mothballed in the second half of the twentieth century. This would entail the opening of all or part of the Leamside Line either as part of the National Rail network, or as an extension of the Tyne and Wear Metro. Both systems could potentially be connected at the northern end of the line at Pelaw Junction, while the Leamside line continues to link with the East Coast Main Line to the south. A third option would be to form a loop line with the Sunderland Metro extension, which runs on the trackbed of the Durham to Sunderland Line as far as South Hylton, with the disused trackbed continuing to its junction with the Leamside Line. Although the historical junction only allowed trains to merge onto the Leamside Line in a southerly direction, space is available to create a short section joining the two tracks in the other direction.
Re-opening of the line has been suggested by many stakeholders including the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority (on 28 January 2010), the Association of Train Operating Companies and Durham City Council. The case for re-opening the line includes providing a Tyneside to Teesside commuter express train between Newcastle Central Station and Middlesbrough which, according to the 2007 report produced by AECOM Faber Maunsell, would have a passenger patronage level of over 700,000 per annum with 90,000 of those utilising Park and Ride facilities at Washington and Durham (Belmont). In addition, the route would become a strategic diversionary route from the East Coast Main Line and could accommodate expansion of the Tyne and Wear Metro system between Washington and Pelaw.
TyneTees Express railway stations, as stated by the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority, would include: Newcastle Central Station; East Gateshead (Park Lane); Washington Parkway (Glover Road); Washington (Station Road); Penshaw (Coxgreen Road); Fencehouses (level crossing); Durham Parkway (Belmont); Ferryhill; Stockton; Thornaby; and Middlesbrough.
Track removal.
On 14 September 2006, Network Rail announced plans to lift the track along the full length of the line. It was maintained that the track, after 15 years out of use, would need replacing anyway if the line was ever to re-open, and that this move would have no implications for any future use of the railway. The company also pledged that all bridges would be left in place, with no sales of land attached to the line. A former British Rail engineer, who oversaw a major upgrade of the line just two years before its closure, has countered Network Rail's claims, saying that the track is still in excellent condition and would need only minimal refurbishment to bring it back into use. In July 2010 the government said they have no plans to reopen the line, but the land the track runs on will not be sold. The track remained largely in place until its complete removal early in 2013.

List of England international footballers

The England national football team represents the country of England in international association football. It is fielded by The Football Association, the governing body of football in England, and competes as a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), which encompasses the countries of Europe. England was one of the teams which competed in the first ever international association football match on 30 November 1872. As hundreds of players have played for the team since it started officially registering its players in 1872, only players with 25 or more official caps are included.
Despite the first England international game taking place on 30 November 1872, the first player to reach 25 caps for his country was Bob Crompton, who played his 25th match against Hungary on 29 May 1909. His final match, and 41st cap, was the 3-1 defeat against Scotland on 14 April 1914. Crompton's record stood for over 38 years when Billy Wright overtook his tally when he appeared for England against Austria on 25 May 1952. Wright far surpassed Crompton's earlier record, playing 105 times for England, his final match being against the United States on 28 May 1959. Wright's tally was only just surpassed by Bobby Charlton, who made his 106th appearance for England in their 3-2 loss to West Germany in the 1970 FIFA World Cup quarter finals.
Charlton's record did not last as long, with it being overtaken by his former team mate Bobby Moore on 14 June 1973. Moore only made one further appearance for England, leaving a record standing at 108 caps set on 14 November 1973. Goalkeeper Peter Shilton broke this record on 7 June 1989 in a friendly match against Denmark. Shilton's last match for England was the third/fourth place playoff against Italy in the 1990 FIFA World Cup, having set a new record for England appearances at 125 caps.

Black liquor

In industrial chemistry, black liquor is the waste product from the kraft process when digesting pulpwood into paper pulp removing lignin, hemicelluloses and other extractives from the wood to free the cellulose fibers.
The equivalent material in the sulfite process is usually called brown liquor, but the terms red liquor, thick liquor and sulfite liquor are also used.
Composition.
Approximately 7 tonnes of black liquor are produced in the manufacture of one tonne of pulp.
The black liquor is an aqueous solution of lignin residues, hemicellulose, and the inorganic chemicals used in the process. The black liquor comprises 15% solids by weight of which 10% are organic chemicals and 5% are inorganic chemicals. Normally the organics in black liquor are 40-45% soaps, 35-45% lignin and 10-15% other organics.
The organic matter in the black liquor is made up of water/alkali soluble degradation components from the wood. Lignin is degraded to shorter fragments with sulphur content at 1-2% and sodium content at about 6% of the dry solids. Cellulose and hemicellulose is degraded to aliphatic carboxylic acid soaps and hemicellulose fragments. The extractives gives tall oil soap and crude turpentine. The soaps contain about 20% sodium.
The residual lignin components currently serve for hydrolytic or pyrolytic conversion or just burning only. Hemicellulosis may undergo fermentation processes, alternatively.
History.
Early kraft pulp mills discharged black liquor to watercourses. Black liquor is quite toxic to aquatic life, and causes a very dark caramel color in the water. The invention of the recovery boiler by G.H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s, was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.
By 2000, the better kraft mills recovered 99.5% or more of the black liquor, and purified the remainder in biological treatment plants, reducing the environmental impact of the waste waters below the level of scientific significance, except perhaps in very small streams. Even in the 21st century, some small kraft mills remained (producing at most a few tons of pulp per day) that discharged all black liquor. However, these are rapidly disappearing. Some kraft mills, particularly in North America, still recovered under 98% of the black liquor in 2007, which can cause some environmental issues, even when biologically treated. The general trend is for such obsolete mills to modernize or shut down.
Usage.
The black liquor contains more than half of the energy content of the wood fed into the digester of a kraft pulp mill. It is normally concentrated to 65 - 80% by multi-effect evaporators and burned in a recovery boiler to produce energy and recover the cooking chemicals. The viscosity increases as the concentration goes up. At about 50 - 55% solids the salt solubility limit is reached. Tall oil is an important byproduct separated from the black liquor with skimming before it goes to the evaporators or after the first evaporator stage.
Energy source for the pulp mill.
Pulp mills have used black liquor as an energy source since at least the 1930s.
Most kraft pulp mills use recovery boilers to recover and burn much of the black liquor they produce, generating steam and recovering the cooking chemicals (sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide used to separate lignin from the cellulose fibres needed for papermaking). This has helped paper mills reduce problems with water emissions, reduce their use of chemicals by recovery and reuse, and become nearly energy self-sufficient by producing, on average, 66 percent of their own electricity needs on-site.
In the United States, paper companies have consumed nearly all of the black liquor they produce since the 1990s. As a result, the forest products industry has become one of the United States' leading generators of carbon-neutral renewable energy, producing approximately 28.5 million megawatt hours of electricity annually.
Use as biofuel feedstock.
Gasification.
New waste-to-energy methods to recover and utilize the energy in the black liquor have been developed. The use of black liquor gasification has the potential to achieve higher overall energy efficiency than the conventional recovery boiler while generating an energy-rich syngas from the liquor. The syngas can be burnt in a gas turbine combined cycle to produce electricity (usually called "BLGCC" for Black Liquor Gasification Combined Cycle; similar to IGCC) or converted through catalytic processes into chemicals or fuels such as methanol, dimethyl ether (DME), or F-T diesel (usually called "BLGMF" for Black Liquor Gasification for Motor Fuels). This gasification technology is currently under operation in a 3 MW pilot plant at Chemrec’s test facility in Piteå, Sweden. The DME synthesis step will be added in 2011 in the "BioDME" project, supported by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) and the Swedish Energy Agency.
Used for biofuels production the black liquor gasification route has been shown to have very high conversion efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction potential.
Extraction of lignin.
Where recovery boiler capacity is limited and a bottleneck in the pulp mill the lignin in the black liquor may be extracted and exported or used as fuel in the mill's lime kiln, thereby often replacing fossil based fuel with biofuel.
U.S. tax credit 2007 - 2010.
A tax credit created by the U.S. Congress in 2005 as part of the to reward and support the use of liquid alternative fuel derived from hydrocarbons in the transportation sector was expanded in 2007 to include non-mobile uses of liquid alternative fuel derived from biomass. This change meant that, in addition to fish processors, animal renderers and meat packers, kraft pulp producers became eligible for the tax credit as a result of their generation and use of black liquor to make energy. For one large company (International Paper) this could amount to as much as $3.7 billion in benefits. Weyerhaeuser announced in May 2009 that it was also pursuing the tax credit. While some have criticized the paper industry's eligibility for the alternative fuel mix tax credit on the grounds that it is increasing fossil fuel use, the industry has countered that adding a fossil fuel is actually a requirement of the law and that, regardless, this does not result in a net increase in fossil fuel use since companies are merely replacing the existing fossil fuel they already mix with black liquor—natural gas—with one of the three fuels specified by the law: gasoline, kerosene or diesel. The bio-fuel credit for Black Liquor ended on Jan 1, 2010.

Doryanthes excelsa

Doryanthes excelsa, known as Gymea Lily, is a flowering plant indigenous to the coastal areas of New South Wales near Sydney.
The plant has sword-like leaves more than a meter long. It flowers in spring and summer, sending up a flower spike up to 6 m high, which at its apex bears a large cluster of bright red flowers, each 10 cm across.
The name "Gymea Lily" is derived from a local Eora dialect. "Dory-anthes" means spear-flower in Greek, and "excelsa" is Latin for exceptional. The Sydney suburbs of Gymea and Gymea Bay are named after the lily. 
History.
The genus "Doryanthes" was first described in 1802 by the Portuguese priest, statesman, philosopher and botanist José Francisco Correia de Serra (1750–1823), a close friend of Sir Joseph Banks. "Doryanthes excelsa" has also inspired the naming of Doryanthes, the journal of history and heritage for Southern Sydney founded by Dharawal historian Les Bursill.

Neat Stuff

Neat Stuff is an American alternative comic book series created by Peter Bagge and published by Fantagraphics. It ran from 1985 to 1989 for fifteen issues. Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology. Described by Dez Skinn in "Comix: The Underground Revolution" as the work which "threw Peter Bagge into the limelight", Bagge soon retired the title in preference of continuing the Bradleys characters's story in "Hate.
"Neat Stuff'"s contents were collected in four books: "The Bradleys", "Studs Kirby", "Junior and Other Losers", and "Stupid Comics".

Charlton Kings

Charlton Kings is a suburb of Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, England. The area constitutes a civil parish. Prior to the Local Government Act 1972 coming into force on 1 April 1974, it had been an urban district. Its population is just over 10,000. The River Chelt enters the suburb of Charlton Kings from the easterly direction. The Cotswold Way National Trail is on its eastern boundary and runs alongside Dowdeswell Reservoir dam and Woods.
It is in the heart of the Cotswolds with beautiful surroundings. Lineover Wood SSSI lies on the Cotswold District side of the eastern boundary. Charlton Kings Common and Leckhampton Hill are designated an SSSI by Natural England.
History.
The name Charlton Kings comes from Anglo-Saxon times, the word "Charlton" evolved from the term "ceorls' tun", a ceorl or churl being the Saxon term for an independent peasant landowner and tun meaning a fenced enclosure with a dwelling. This particular ceorl's tun was established as part of the royal manor and Hundred of Cheltenham, hence the term "Kings" in the name.
Early settlement.
Evidence of settlement in Charlton Kings as early as the middle Iron Age was found underneath a Roman villa discovered in 1980. There are many other Roman settlements close by such as Chedworth, Whittington and notably a field called Wycomb (formerly Wickham), and the area of Charlton Kings is well suited to settlement due to the well drained sand and gravel composition of the soil making early settlement much more likely. It is also believed that Chuck Norris was once a resident here, occupying the main stately home in the centre of Charlton Kings, he ran a small martial arts school on the green on Sunday Mornings. Much of early Charlton Kings was used for agriculture, tended to by small homesteads. This is evidenced by place names surviving until today. These small homesteads gave way to larger manor houses, for example, Charlton House which is now the headquarters of the engineering company Spirax Sarco. There is evidence in local place today of the crops previously grown in Charlton Kings, such as Hempcroft (hemp), Flaxley (flax) and Crab End (crab apples). Other crops known to be grown in the area were cherries and grapes. There is no evidence to suggest that Charlton Kings was badly affected by the Black Death and subsequent plagues as other areas of England were.
Transport.
Charlton Kings is served by Stagecoach West, the local division of the Stagecoach Group. Stagecoach West provide a regular bus service around Charlton Kings and into Cheltenham. Main roads to London and Oxford (A40), Bath (A46) and Cirencester (A417) all run through Charlton Kings providing good connections, buses from Stagecoach and National Express also serve these destinations with stops in Charlton Kings.
Plans for a railway line through Charlton Kings were first drafted in 1872. The Charlton Kings section of the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway line had a troublesome construction mainly due to the clay in the soil, progress was slow, and the line was opened in 1881 with a small station in Charlton Kings. From 1891 the line was also part of the Midland and South Western Junction Railway (M&SWJR) between Cheltenham and Swindon, a north-south route that went on through Swindon to Andover and the south coast ports. Between 1899 and 1914, the Charlton Kings line had frequent services to Cheltenham, Banbury and Swindon as well as major expresses to destinations such as Manchester, Birmingham and Southampton using the line. Rail traffic along the M&SWJR line greatly increased due to the transportation of men and munitions southwards during World War I and World War II. After the war, the line was used much less. The M&SWJR closed on 9 September 1961 and the Cheltenham to Banbury line closed on 15 October 1962, when the station at Charlton Kings finally shut.
Electric trams operated by the Cheltenham and District Light Railway were also used in Charlton Kings between 1903 and 1930 when they were replaced by buses.
Churches.
Charlton Kings has four churches:
Glenfall Church (formerly Glenfall Fellowship) now meets outside the parish.
St Mary's Church.
St Mary's church, dedicated to Mary in 1190 by William de Vere, Bishop of Hereford, is the oldest church in Charlton Kings. It was built to ease the nearby Cheltenham parish church due to increasing congregation size. 
It houses numerous historical artifacts, including an old alms chest used for collecting money to donate to the Third Crusade which may date back to 1190. The church also contains a stained glass window which was donated by Japanese naval officers to the church in 1907 in memory of Robert Podmore. St Mary's church houses one of the oldest royal arms in the country, it was acquired in 1660 to celebrate the restoration of Charles II and restored in 1988 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of George III's visit to Charlton Kings. Robert Burns's granddaughters, Sarah and Annie Burns and his great-granddaughter Margaret Constance Burns Hutchinson were all buried at St Mary's church between 1909 and 1925.
Holy Apostles Church.
Holy Apostles Church is located in a triangular junction between the roads to London and Cirencester. This location for the church was contested early in its development as local people thought that if another church was to be built, it would be better to have it in a location where it could serve more isolated parishioners. The foundation stone of the church was laid in 1866.
Sports and recreation.
Local community organisations include:
Politics.
Charlton Kings is in the Charlton Kings ward of Cheltenham Borough Council, the Charlton Kings division of Gloucestershire County Council and the parliamentary constituency of Cheltenham.

Pachyuromys

Pachyuromys duprasi is a rodent belonging to subfamily Gerbillinae. It is the only member of the genus Pachyuromys. These rodents are the most docile species of the Gerbil subfamily. Often called the fat-tailed gerbil or duprasi gerbil. Other common English names: fat-tailed jird, fat-tailed rat, beer mat gerbil. Names in other languages: ' (أبو ليه) in Egyptian Arabic, and ' (عضل أليان) in Standard Arabic, ' (French), ' (German), ' (Danish), ' (Finnish), "" (Dutch). They have a fluffy and soft fur. Fat-tailed gerbils are very new on the pet market.
Appearance.
The fat-tailed gerbil is a medium sized gerbil. Its body length is about 10 cm (4”), with a tail length of about 5 cm (2”). This gerbil has a thick, soft, fluffy coat. The hair at the back and the head is yellow-coloured, with a dark grey basis and a small black tip. The belly is clear white. Fat-tailed gerbils weigh about 40 grams. Their body is round and somewhat flattened. They have no clear neck and a very sharp face, with large oval-shaped black eyes. The ears of this species are low positioned, which gives this species a fox-like head. The legs are comparatively short for a gerbil. They look similar to a hamster, but unlike a hamster they have a pointed snout and a fat, almost bald, club-shaped tail from which they gets their common name of 'fat-tailed gerbil'. The fat-tailed gerbil stores fat and water in its tail, in the same way that the camel stores fat in its hump. Therefore, a healthy fat-tailed gerbil should have a nicely rounded tail. It is this tail which makes them easy to distinguish from all other gerbil species.
Lifespan.
Captive specimens of the fat-tailed gerbil have a life span of between 5 and 8 years. In the wild, they are unlikely to reach this age.
Origin.
The French zoologist Fernand Lataste discovered "Pachyuromys duprasi" in 1880 in Laghouat, Algeria. He was the first to describe the animal in detail in Le Naturaliste.
Fat-tailed gerbils are originally found in the Northern Sahara (North-western Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria). There they live in sparsely vegetated sand sheets or rocky deserts. In the wild, fat-tailed gerbils live in simple burrows about one meter deep, in hard sandy soil. They may also occupy burrows of other species'.
Food.
Fat-tailed gerbils are, as their pointed snout would suggest, mostly insectivorous in the wild, but will eat also a variety of plants. In captivity, they are kept on normal basic rodent mix, used to feed Mongolian gerbils or hamsters. They are particularly fond of mealworms, crickets, moths, and almost any other insect, even beetles. In addition, they can also be given some vegetables and fruit, like carrots, cauliflower, chicory, and apples. Because fat-tailed gerbils originated in dry areas and are not used to food which has high moisture content, they can get diarrhea after eating too much fruit and vegetable matter. Branches and twigs are rich in vitamins and very suitable besides their basic food, especially in winter. It is also good for their teeth, because they keep growing their whole life and by gnawing they keep their incisors at the right length. Hay is also very good for fat-tailed gerbils, because of its high fibre content.
Housing.
The best way to keep fat-tailed gerbils is in a tank (aquarium / terrarium). It should measure at least 60x40 cm (24” x 16”) for 2-4 gerbils. Fat-tailed gerbils are fond of digging, so it is important to provide them with a thick layer of bedding. Wood shavings can be used, but not pine or red cedar wood shavings; many rodents can react allergically to them, and may develop respiratory problems. Aspen wood shavings are considered to be the best. They also need to take a sand bath regularly to prevent their fur from becoming greasy. Fat-tailed gerbils will make a nest; this may be underground in their burrow, on the surface in the bedding, or in a nesting box. Fat-tailed gerbils can be kept occupied by giving them gerbil toys, for example an exercise wheel. Keeping a breeding pair can be somewhat difficult. It is possible to keep fat-tailed gerbils singly, like Syrian hamsters.
Behavior.
Fat-tailed gerbils are sociable animals, and sometimes live in colonies, but can also live solitary (alone). In the wild fat-tailed gerbils become active at dusk. In captivity fat-tailed gerbils seem to be diurnal. This gerbil species is active for some very short periods in between longer periods of sleep, and they are very deep sleepers. They sometimes go into a state similar to hibernation, but not true hibernation. Fat-tailed gerbils are very docile and almost never bite. People say even that wild fat-tailed gerbils that are trapped can even be handled right away without being bitten. They seem to lack the curiosity of the Mongolian gerbil, and behave more like a Syrian hamster than a gerbil. Fat-tailed gerbils spend a lot of time grooming their fur and washing their face. They like to dig a lot and take sand baths. They also enjoy running on exercise wheels.
When they fight,they shriek loudly and bite each other's tails . The mating ritual of the fat-tailed gerbil may also be confused with fighting.
Male fat-tailed gerbils, like most other rodents, have scent glands on their stomach and engage in marking their territory by stretching out and rubbing their bellies on the ground and furnishings. Their scent markings don’t seem to be discernible to people and there is no noticeable odour from their cage like with hamsters or mice.
Breeding.
Fat-tailed gerbils are sexually mature when they are 2 months old, and in captivity they reproduce the whole year round. The gestation period of the fat-tailed gerbil is 19 days. Their average litter size is 3 to 6, and the pups are weaned at 3–4 weeks.
Breeding fat-tailed gerbils in captivity can be hard, as the females can be very aggressive when they are pregnant or nursing pups. They will attack the male, and even kill her mate if he is not housed separately after mating has taken place. The chance of a female housed with a male becoming pregnant is much less than it is with Mongolian gerbils. A proven method to breed fat-tailed gerbils it putting a male and a female together in a rather small tank with nothing else in it than some bedding material. No nesting box, nothing to play with, no food dish. This way there is really nothing the animals can fight about. They can’t become territorial because of the small space and because there are no points to use as demarcation. With this method it is needed to keep the male and female together for one week and then separate them and put them in a nice big tank with all kind of furnishings, most likely the female is already pregnant.
The mating ritual of the fat-tailed gerbil is rather unusual. Both male and female stand on their hind legs and wrestle, making squeaking noise. They never seem to actually bite each other, but they get rather rowdy. If the female is not receptive and the male doesn’t give up, the female will turn and kick bedding at the male. The female will make a nest and get a little nippy when she will be ready to have her litter. They are good mothers.
Sexing.
The difference between a male and a female fat-tailed gerbil is the same as with other small rodents. This difference can be seen at the distance between the urinary and anal openings. The distance between these openings in male fat-tailed gerbils is much larger than it is in females. Adult males have a large bulge at the base of the tail that is their scrotum. So their testicles are clearly visible. This is totally absent from females. When the pups have an age of about 2 weeks the hairs on the belly start to grow and bald spots can be seen on the belly of the females. These are her nipples. These bald spots are absent in males.
Colour mutations.
It appears that in Japan and other places either a grey (g) or chinchilla (cch) mutation has appeared. This fat-tailed gerbil is greyer in colour. But not everyone is sure that it is a colour mutation. It is also possible that these grey fat-tailed gerbils are from the Egyptian subspecies "Pachyuromys duprasi natronensis". The juvenile coat of these gerbils is very grey but faded with age to a much more sandy colour. Some hybrids of the Egyptian and the Algerian subspecies have this grey coat as well, although it does lighten with age but is still greyish. Nothing else is known at this time.
Purchase.
Duprasi are very new to the pet market, so they are not available on many places. In some countries they are not available, in some they are rare, (Germany, France,Denmark and the UK) and in some countries, like the Netherlands they are quite common. Occasionally they can be found in a pet shop, but most don’t have them.
Ailments.
A healthy fat-tailed gerbil has bright eyes, is lively, and has a soft coat. Their behind is dry and clean. Sick fat-tailed gerbils get lethargic and are not lively. Preventing is always better than curing, especially for small rodents, such as the fat-tailed gerbil. It's not always easy to cure a fat-tailed gerbil. Fat-tailed gerbils are so small that even a vet won't always know how he must treat the animal. For fat-tailed gerbils can catching a cold could be very dangerous and even fatal. The biggest threats for a fat-tailed gerbil are draught and moisture, but also too high temperatures, wrong or bad food, and stress can lead to health problems. There is not much known about diseases of fat-tailed gerbils, because this small rodent has not been kept as a pet that long and often. But small rodents have generally the same ailments. An ailment that relatively often can be seen in fat-tailed gerbils are bite wounds at their tail, because fighting fat-tailed gerbils try to bite in each other's thick tail.

Smooth (radio network)

smoothfm is a network of two Australian commercial radio stations operated by NOVA Entertainment in Sydney and Melbourne.
The format is focused on providing 'more music and less talk' along with an eclectic easy-listening playlist. 
Vega first launched in August 2005 in Sydney and September 2005 in Melbourne where the format was aimed at baby boomers including a mix of news and talk. In March 2010, it was rebranded under the name Classic Rock after failing to gain a significant audience under the name Vega. In March 2011, the network was quietly rebranded again as Sydney 95.3FM and Melbourne 91.5FM until smoothfm was launched in May 2012. 
In February 2013, smoothfm extended broadcasting nationally on DAB+ to Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.

TV Channel.
Smooth is a 24 hour Australian pay television music channel available via Foxtel satellite and cable services. It launched on 3 December 2013, dedicated to easy listening adult contemporary music.
Vega.
Vega launched in 2005 to target the baby boomer market of listeners in the 40 to 60 age bracket, with a mix of talk and music from the 1960s to the 2000s.
Survey results.
During its first ACNielsen ratings survey (No. 8, 2005, covering mid-September to November of that year), Vega's stations had failed to attract a significant audience. The Sydney station reached a 1.8 percent audience share, and the Melbourne station gained a 1.2 percent share, placing it second last (ahead only of ABC NewsRadio) and last out of surveyed stations in each market, respectively. However, station management state that the slow take-up was to be expected, claiming the target audience will be slower than some audience groups to try a new station. In June 2006 [http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/we-dont-talk-any-more/2006/06/03/1148956582643.html] the Sydney and Melbourne stations stopped sharing programmes. Both stations dropped their "40 years of music" slogan and moved drive-time hosts Rebecca Wilson and Tony Squires to share the Sydney breakfast slot with former host Angela Catterns. The changes have been slow to grow market share, with the Sydney audience falling to 1.7% in Sydney (No. 6, 2006, but climbing slowly to 1.8% in Melbourne, which, at the time, was their highest audience share to date in Melbourne.
By the end of 2006, Vega had increased their ratings share in both cities. The Sydney station reached 2.8%, while the Melbourne station reached 3%.
In January 2007, Vega expanded its "Vega Variety" positioner to include "the 70s, 80s and the best new songs", and also put out advertisements in the form of billboards and on the side of buses, based around that expanded positioner. It was hoped that this would encourage more listeners to sample the station.
In the first radio survey of 2007, Vega in Sydney and Melbourne again both had small increases, with the Sydney station reaching 3% and the Melbourne station reaching 3.3%. The station's best demographic performer on both stations in that survey, is the 25-39 age group.
By the 4th radio survey of 2007, Vega in Sydney and Melbourne had gone over the 4% mark, with the Sydney station rating 4.6% and the Melbourne station rating 4.4%. In the 40-54 age group, Vega in Sydney was the second highest rating FM station in that age group after classic hits station WS-FM, who, traditionally, have been the highest rating FM station in that age group.
In the 5th radio survey of 2008, Vega in Sydney had surpassed the 5% mark for the first time, rating very closely behind main rival FM stations Triple M & WS-FM. The station also became the highest rating FM station in the 40-54 age group, knocking WS-FM off that position.
Classic Rock.
Consistently low ratings led to DMG's decision to rebrand Vega as 'Classic Rock' and relaunch it on Friday 12 March 2010 as a competitor to similar stations Gold 104.3/101.7 WSFM and Triple M.
Sackings and low ratings.
Melbourne newspaper The Age reported on July 22, 2010 that ""Following last week’s sacking of breakfast hosts Ian ‘‘Dicko’’ Dickson and Dave O’Neil, Classic Rock now has the dubious distinction of being the only commercial FM station without any programs.
"Sure, it broadcasts the externally produced Cover to Cover with Barry Bissell and the American Nights with Alice Cooper — both of which are music-oriented — but it has no talk-based breakfast or drive show and no announcers in the morning, afternoon or night shifts. Instead, listeners will get wall-to-wall classic rock songs with news, weather and sport updates.""

Caledonian Railway 439 Class

The Caledonian Railway 439 Class is a class of 0-4-4T steam locomotive. It was a development of earlier Caledonian Railway 0-4-4T locomotives, including the 19 Class and 92 Class, and predecessor of the 431 Class. The 439 Class was introduced by John F. McIntosh in 1900 and a modified version was introduced by William Pickersgill in 1915.
Introduction.
Ninety-two engines of the class were built between 1900 and 1925, a few under LMS auspices. Seventy-four Class 439s passed into British Railways ownership in 1948 and they were numbered 55159-55236 (with gaps).
Earlier versions.
The 19 and 92 Classes were originally fitted with condensing apparatus for use on Glasgow Central Low Level lines. Twenty-four of them passed into British Railways ownership and they were numbered 55119-55146 (with gaps).
Later versions.
In 1922 Pickersgill introduced the 431 Class with larger cylinders and cast-iron front buffer beam for banking. The idea was, presumably, to move the centre of gravity forwards and put more weight on the driving wheels. However, it seems strange to use a large-wheeled 0-4-4T (rather than a small-wheeled 0-6-0T) for banking. The 431 Class was numbered 431–434 by the Caledonian, 15237–15240 by the LMS, and 55237–55240 by British Railways.
In 1925 the LMS introduced their own version of the 439 Class and these were numbered 55260-55269 by British Railways.
In the 431 and LMS classes, the cylinder bore was increased to 18¼" and this increased the tractive effort to .
Preservation.
One, CR 419, (later LMS number 15189, BR 55189) has been preserved and is the flagship of the Scottish Railway Preservation Society.
419 is currently undergoing a major overhaul and is temporarily out of service.

Cloone

Cloone () is a village in County Leitrim, Ireland. The village is located in the south of the county, just off the R201 regional road; its nearest town is Mohill. 
Its name is an Anglicised version of the Irish-language word "cluain", meaning meadow.
Buildings.
St. James's Church Tower.
The bell tower of St James's Church of Ireland is all that is left of a building that was erected by the Board of First Fruits in 1822. The tower was restored in the mid-1990s and a clock installed, which was manufactured by Samuel Elliott of Dublin. It is a local landmark from which some of the finest angling waters in the area can be seen off the Cloone to Ballinamore Road.
World War I (1914-1918) casualties from Cloone.
A total of eleven men from Cloone Village and the surrounding area are known to have died whilst on active service during the Great War (1914–1918), having given the locality as their place of birth or permanent domicile at the time of their enlistment.
Those bodies recovered and identified were interred in various military cemeteries administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Belgium (La Laiterie Military Cemetery), France (Cabaret-Rouge British Cemetery, Cuinchy Communal Cemetery, Philosophe British Cemetery & Savy British Cemetery), Israel (Beersheba War Cemetery) and Turkey (Lala Baba Cemetery). However, those men who lost their lives at the Battle of the Somme with no known graves have their names recorded on the 'Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme' in France.

Hydlide 3

Story.
Many years after the events of "Hydlide II", an explosion of flames appeared near The City of the Woods. After that, enemies were everywhere. A young man is chosen to find the source of the evil.
Gameplay.
The game incorporates a 'good/evil character' morality/alignment system. Like its predecessor "" (1985), the player has a morality meter that can be aligned with either Justice, Normal, or Evil. The game has both good and evil monsters. Evil monsters attack the player character on sight, while good monsters only attack if the player character attacks them first. Killing any monster, good or evil, results in a reward of experience points, money, and occasionally a piece of equipment. However, if the player kills a good monster, points are lost from a statistic called "MF" (Moral Fiber). If the player's MF stat drops to zero, frequent traps will appear across the world. If the player manages to keep it over 100, rewards appear in the form of random items found around Fairyland. The player can also kill good monsters, which usually lowers the morality meter. Unlike "Hydlide II", however, the morality meter no longer has an impact on the way in which the townsfolk react to the player.
The game also features an in-game clock setting day-night cycles, where the character must eat two times a day and sleep regularly. If the characters fails to eat at a scheduled time or stays up past 11 p.m., his HP and attack power will begin to gradually drop. Staying at an inn will take care of both the character's sleep needs and all meals scheduled during his stay. Thus, if the character buys a room at an inn at 10:45, he will not need to purchase any rations. Meals taken during adventuring are taken care of by carrying food rations; if the character has an available food ration at a scheduled meal time (and is not staying at an inn), the food ration is automatically consumed, restoring some HP and averting hunger.
Another aspect of the game is the weight system. Every item in the game (including money) has weight. If the total weight of items the player character carries exceeds his "Load Capacity" (LC), he will move much more slowly. The game also makes use of cut scenes for the opening and ending, a combat system that is similar to "Ys", the choice between four distinct character classes (with the Fighter and Thief being melee with minor spell access, while the Monk and Cleric are more adept spell casters), and a wide variety of equipment and spells.

G.I. Joe (comics)

G.I. Joe has been the title of comic strips and comic books in every decade since 1942. As a licensed property by Hasbro, comics have been released from 1967 to present, with only two interruptions longer than a year (1977–1981, 1997–2000). As a team fighting Cobra since 1982, the comic book history of "" has been covered by three separate publishers and four main-title series, all of which have been based on the Hasbro toy line of the same name.
The first series was produced by Marvel Comics between 1982 and 1994, running for 155 issues, and spawning several spin-off titles throughout the course of its run; the second and third series, published by Devil's Due Productions from 2001 to 2008, totaled 80 issues and included several spin-off titles as well. The fourth series has been published by IDW Publishing since October 2008, and various spin-off titles have also been launched.
King Features Syndicate.
In 1937, after receiving a $30 check from "The Saturday Evening Post", Dave Breger arrived in New York and began freelancing to "Collier's", "Parade", "This Week", "Esquire", "Click" and "The New Yorker". Early in 1941, he was drafted into the United States Army and sent to Camp Livingston in Louisiana, where he repaired trucks. He drew at night in the bakery or while sitting in a truck with netting overhead to keep the bugs away. "The Saturday Evening Post", under the heading "Private Breger", began publishing these cartoons as a series starting August 30, 1941.
The Army became aware of his talent and transferred him to the Special Services Division in New York, where he married Brooklyn-born art agent Dorathy Lewis on January 9, 1942. In the early spring of 1942, he was assigned to the New York staff of "Yank, the Army Weekly".
"Yank" wanted Breger to do cartoons like those in "The Saturday Evening Post", but the editors asked him to devise a new title. He came up with the title "G.I. Joe" from the military term "Government Issue", and the character's full name was Joe Trooper. His "G.I. Joe" cartoon series began in the first issue of "Yank" (June 17, 1942). That summer, Breger arrived in the UK in 1942 as one of the first two "Yank" correspondents, covering the American military in England as a photo-journalist, while also producing his weekly "G.I. Joe" cartoon for "Yank".
King Features Syndicate took an interest and signed Breger on to do a "Private Breger" (aka "Private Breger Abroad") daily panel for domestic distribution. It was launched October 19, 1942 and continued until October 13, 1945.
Ziff-Davis.
Ziff-Davis's "G.I. Joe" was set during the Korean War. Ziff-Davis was in the habit of numbering their first issues "10". When the series became popular, they reset the numbering system, so there are two issues for each number from 10 to 14, and no issues numbered 1 through 5.
Volume 1 started in 1950 and lasted five issues, numbered 10 through 14. Volume 2 continuing from the previous volume was published from 1951, and lasted 46 issues numbered 6 through 51.
DC Comics.
In 1964-65, DC Comics released two issues of "Showcase" (#53 and 54) titled "G.I. Joe", which took place during World War II.
Custom Comics.
In 1967, Hasbro released a single small comic book titled "America's Movable Fighting Man", with its action figures produced by Custom Comics, Inc.
In 1969, issues of a larger format comic with more elaborate stories were released with toys as "The Adventures of G. I. Joe". From 1970 to 1976, Hasbro continued to reprint and publish new comics in-house as "The G. I. Joe Adventure Team" (see the Hasbro section).
Marvel Comics.
A Real American Hero (main series).
Hasbro relaunched their G.I. Joe franchise with , which was supported by a Marvel Comics series of the same name. It was unique at the time in that it was a comic book series that was promoted on television commercials which also supported the toy line. This 155-issue series is considered to be one of the longest-running comic book tie-ins to a toy line. Much of its success is to be credited to Larry Hama, who wrote the entire series save for a few issues with guest writers. Rather than treating the stories as a mere promotion for the toys, Hama wrote the series with seriousness and infused it with doses of realism, humor, and drama. To keep the series up-to-date on military technology and terminology, Hama continuously read through technical manuals. Other than Transformers, no other series based on a toy line was able to duplicate its success. Notable artists include Herb Trimpe, Ron Wagner, Rod Whigham and Marshall Rogers.
A number of differences existed between the comic book and the animated TV series. Certain characters who were very prominent in the comic book, such as Stalker, were featured very little in the cartoon, while characters who were less prominent in the comic book, such as Shipwreck, were very prominent in the cartoon series. Another difference was that in the comic book featured a romance between Scarlett and Snake-Eyes, whereas in the cartoon, they are not a couple. The most notable difference between the comic and the cartoon, however, is in its handling of combat. While the cartoon had the characters use semi-futuristic laser rifles and pistols (due to an edict for "no bullets" from the studio), the comic book did not shy away from using real-world pistols, rifles, SMGs and ammunition; The cartoon characters would almost comically wade through waves of enemy fire untouched, while the comic book would routinely have characters suffer injuries from bullets or shrapnel; the cartoon showed that nearly every soldier in every battle survived (for example, many shots of aircraft being shot down were shown to have its pilot escape in a parachute), while the comic did not shy away from character deaths; for example, issue #109 included the deaths of a large number of Joes, including fan-favorites like Doc, Breaker, and Quick-Kick, while other storylines included the deaths of Serpentor and Dr. Mindbender.
"G.I. Joe: Order of Battle" was a 4-issue mini series which ran from December 1986 - March 1987. Written by Larry Hama, with art by Herb Trimpe, the first issue spotlighted G.I. Joe characters with code names from A-K. Subsequent issues spotlighted G.I. Joe characters from M-Z, Cobra characters, and vehicles respectively. The second issue erroneously listed Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa character as a member of G.I. Joe. While negotiations had taken place to license the character, the deal had fallen through. The third and fourth issues contained a retraction stating that Rocky Balboa was not and had never been a member of G.I. Joe. A trade-paperback including material from all four issues, was published in 1987, and removed mention of the Rocky character entirely.
G.I. Joe: Special Missions.
The success of the main title lead Marvel Comics to produce a secondary title, "G.I. Joe: Special Missions" which lasted 28 issues. Herb Trimpe was the artist for nearly the entire run, with Dave Cockrum providing pencils on several issues. Spinning out of issue #50 of a story in the main title, the series featured more intense violence and a more ambiguous morality than the main title, while the enemies were conventional terrorists as well as Cobra itself. The first four issues, as well as the backup story from issue #50 of the main title, were later republished as a trade paperback.
Reprints.
The first 37 issues of the main series were released in thirteen digests titled "G.I. Joe Comic Magazine".
"Tales of G.I. Joe" reprinted the first 15 issues of "G.I. Joe" on a higher quality paper stock than that used for the main comic.
Shortly after the final issue, a "G.I. Joe Special" #1 was released, with alternate art for issue #61 by Todd McFarlane. The cover features Snake Eyes in a crouched-down position, in a homage to the "" title that McFarlane illustrated during his tenure at Marvel.
In 2001, with the success of Devil's Due Comics run of "G.I. Joe", Marvel Comics collected the first 50 issues in five trade paperbacks, with ten issues in each book. All covers for the trade paperbacks were drawn by J. Scott Campbell. The Marvel trades were heavily criticized due to printing errors, as the first three volume featured missing pages and pages published out of order. Production of the trade paperback series ultimately ended after the fifth volume, due to low sales and the fact that Marvel only had the original artwork and film negatives for the first 50 issues; further volumes would require tracking down and scanning the uncollected issues and remastering them for publication, which was deemed to be not cost effective given the poor sales of the books.
In 2009, IDW Publishing began to publish the series again. It is called "Classic G.I. Joe" and collected all 155 issues (minus back-up features) over fifteen volume. The first five volumes use the same covers as the Marvel trades (and correct printing errors found in the Marvel trades) and volumes six through nine feature covers from the Devil Due series, a practice which was abandoned due to fan complaints over how the covers did not align with the contents of the issues collected. Volumes ten through fifteen would ultimately feature new artwork commissioned for the trade paperbacks.
Foreign language versions.
G.I. Joe was published in a number of languages, sometimes by local publishers. Issues were translated into German, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, French, French (Canada), Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Japanese, Arabic, Indonesian, and other languages.
Additional series.
A four issue limited series titled "G.I. Joe and the Transformers" teamed-up the Joes with the other popular Hasbro property of the 1980s, Transformers. Written by Michael Higgins, and with art by Herb Trimpe, set inside the continuity of both series, this was not acknowledged until the Transformers showed up in the main G.I. Joe comic years later. The final issue introduced the Transformers character Goldbug, who later appeared in the main "The Transformers" comic book series. A trade paperback later collected all four issues.
"Action Force" was the British counterpart to the 3-inch G.I. Joe toy line. The Action Force comic was launched by Marvel UK in 1987, tying into the previous Battle Action Force, and publishing original strips as well as modified reprints of the U.S. comic, with the team renamed "Action Force". The title lasted fifty issues before merging with Marvel UK's "The Transformers" in early 1988.
Later in 1988, a second series, "Action Force Monthly", was launched due to Marvel UK's decision to produce comics in the American monthly format, and ran for fifteen issues before it was cancelled. The "Action Force Monthly" title was published in the U.S. as "G.I. Joe: European Missions", which kept all of the dialogue from the UK version without attempting to incorporate the reprinted stories into the continuity of the U.S. "G.I. Joe" comic. The comic also included a tie-in story for the UK release of "".
After the cancellation of "Action Force Monthly", the U.S. "G.I. Joe" comic continued to be reprinted in Marvel UK's "The Transformers" comic as a back-up feature, with the dialogue kept intact, until it was dropped in 1991.
Blackthorne Publishing.
Blackthorne Publishing released six issues of "G.I. Joe in 3-D" and one annual. These issues were meant to be read with 3-D glasses. The stories didn't contradict the ongoing Marvel Comics series, but weren't considered canon.
Blackthorne also published three issues of "How to Draw G.I. Joe", as part of their Official "How to Draw" series.
Dark Horse Comics.
In 1996, the G.I. Joe toy line was relaunched with the "G.I. Joe Extreme" series. Dark Horse Comics acquired the rights to publish comics based on the G.I. Joe Extreme property. The first series was a four-issue limited series written by Mike W. Barr and drawn by Tatsuya Ishida, which introduced the main characters. The ongoing "G.I. Joe Extreme" series that was launched afterward dropped the word "Extreme" from the title. The ongoing series lasted four issues before being canceled, although Dark Horse referred to the title as being on hiatus.
Benchpress Comics.
In the spring of 1999, Benchpress Comics announced the acquisition of the rights to produce new G.I. Joe and Transformers comics. The G.I. Joe project was to have included Larry Hama as writer. Benchpress's initial plan was to release two G.I. Joe titles; one would feature a core cast of characters (similar to the Marvel Comics series), while the other would have featured a rotating cast (similar in style to the Special Missions title). For unknown reasons, negotiations over hiring Larry Hama stalled, and Benchpress went bankrupt, losing the license in the process. Larry Hama's series proposal and the three sample pages of the comic that were produced are available online.
Devil's Due Publishing.
"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero" (Reinstated).
In July 2001, Devil's Due acquired the rights to G.I. Joe and released a four-issue limited series through Image Comics, written by Josh Blaylock with John Larter and Steve Kurth as the artists. The title quickly became known to the fans as "A Real American Hero" (vol. 2) (following from Marvel's original series), or "G.I. Joe Reinstated" (the title of the first four-issue arc). A comics convention special was released before the first issue. Strong sales on the limited series led to it being upgraded to an ongoing series, with the publication of a fifth issue and a monthly schedule.
The new series picked up seven years after the end of the Marvel Comics series, and also used elements from the animated TV series. Several older characters were featured in the title alongside several new recruits. Devil's Due later broke with Image Comics and took over the publishing of the book. The series ended with issue #43, and the introduction of a new enemy. Most G.I. Joe titles published by Devil's Due Publishing are available in both comic and trade paperback formats.
"G.I. Joe: Battle Files" gave profiles of the G.I. Joe and Cobra teams, as well as information on their vehicles. "Battle Files" was published between April and September 2002. A "Sourcebook" trade paperback was published in February 2003, which collected issues one through three with additional profiles added.
"G.I. Joe: Frontline" lasted eighteen issues, and featured a rotating creative team for every story. The stories explored what happened to G.I. Joe and Cobra concurrently with the main title's continuity, with the exception of the first arc. Larry Hama wrote "Frontline's" initial offering, "The Mission That Never Was," a four-part series set one month after the events of the Marvel series' issue #155.
There were two four-issue limited series titled "G.I. Joe: Master and Apprentice", written by Brandon Jerwa. The first series was about how Snake Eyes met and trained his apprentice Kamakura, while the second series focused on Storm Shadow and his apprentice/lover Junko Akita.
A single digest titled "Arashikage Showdown" featured Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow, Jinx, Scarlett, Kamakura, T'Jbang, Nunchuk and Budo. The martial arts experts try to recover the secret scrolls of the Arashikage Ninja Clan, to which several of them belong. This book has been considered to be non-canon by fans, as it incorporates magical and fantasy elements not present in the main series.
G.I. Joe: America's Elite.
"G.I. Joe: America's Elite" (officially entitled "G.I. Joe" Volume 2 on the inside cover), started with a "zero" issue, and picked up the story one year after the events of the last issue of "G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero" (vol. 2). The series featured a darker tone and a smaller group of Joes than in "Reinstated". The series started off with the president asking General Joseph Colton, the original G.I. Joe, to be the team's C.O., replacing General Hawk, who was paralyzed in the previous series. Character profiles were provided in the Data Desk Handbook, as well as in individual issues. Joe Casey wrote the first eighteen issues before editor Mike O'Sullivan wrote issues #19 and 20. Mark Powers and Mike Bear became the current writer and penciller on the book with #21. The twelve issue "World War III" story arc ran from issue #25 to #36. The series concluded in July 2008 with issue #36, after Devil's Due lost the G.I. Joe license.
An original one-shot titled "Data Desk Handbook" published files for "G.I. Joe: America's Elite" main characters at the launch of the series. The files are presented as computer entries written by General Joseph Colton. Several other files were later published in individual issues of "America's Elite", "Special Missions" and several trade paperback volumes. An updated version in two issues (A-M and N-Z) was released in October and November 2007.
The one-shot issue "The Hunt for Cobra Commander" was set in the year between the Devil's Due "A Real American Hero" series and "America's Elite" series, and featured G.I. Joe team member Spirit.
Storm Shadow.
"Storm Shadow", written by Larry Hama, lasted seven issues and focused on former Cobra and G.I. Joe team member Storm Shadow. The series began in May 2007, and, while not bearing the "America's Elite" subtitle, the events occurred in the same time frame as the main series.
Special Missions.
"Special Missions" was a series of one-shots featuring reservist Joes, and set in different parts of the world. The series bore the subtitle "America's Elite".
Declassified.
The various "Declassified" series and one-shots explore the origins of the characters, and are set before #1 of Marvel's "G.I. Joe" series.
Alternate universes.
DDP also published comics in three alternate continuities.
G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers.
"G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers" was a series of cross-productions with Dreamwave Productions, who, at the time of publication, held the license to create Transformers comics. Each studio released their own six-issue mini-series, which featured their own take on a crossover between the two franchises. Unlike previous efforts to bring the two properties together, the Devil's Due story takes place in an alternate present day, where Cobra, just rising to prominence, has uncovered the Ark. Cobra steals the Transformers found inside, such as Optimus Prime, Ironhide and Ratchet, and adapt them into Cobra assault vehicles such as Cobra H.I.S.S. tanks. G.I. Joe is formed to stop Cobra, and receive unexpected help from Wheeljack and Bumblebee, who managed to avoid being taken by Cobra.
The second mini-series was a sequel to the first story. Cybertronian technology has augmented both G.I. Joe and Cobra's forces, who are still fighting each other. During a battle, an accident causes several Joes and members of Cobra to be accidentally transported to Cybertron. The backlash of the accident also pulls several Transformers to Earth, as well as scattering them through time. The Joes and Cobra must travel into the past and future, to retrieve the missing Autobots and Decepticons before the Earth is destroyed. This is complicated by the fact that most of Cybertron is under the control of the Decepticon Shockwave.
The third mini-series, entitled "The Art of War", followed on from the second mini-series, using elements of the first. The new story focused on a re-imagined version of Serpentor, in this continuity a cyborg created from the DNA of great war leaders, and the mechanical components of Megatron. Inadvertently freed by a Cobra raid, Serpentor journeyed to Cybertron. Now Hawk, Grimlock and the other Autobots and Joes must stop him before he takes the Autobot Matrix of Leadership for himself.
A fourth mini-series consisting of two double-sized issues, entitled "Black Horizon", was released in early 2007. After Hawk resigned from G.I. Joe in the wake of the events of "The Art of War", he formed a loose alliance with the Autobots to stop the spread of Cybertronian technology. However, a much bigger threat looms: the serpent cult Cobra-La and the dark god of the Transformers Unicron. Hawk, Flint, and Optimus Prime go the Himalayas to confront Cobra-La, and find a long lost hero: Joe Colton, the original G.I. Joe.
G.I. Joe Reloaded.
"G.I. Joe Reloaded" was a fourteen-issue ongoing series published by Devil's Due which was set in an alternate universe, and featured a more realistic take on the G.I. Joe franchise. The ongoing series was preceded by the "Cobra Reborn" and "G.I. Joe Reborn" one-shots, which introduced the main characters and showed the formation of G.I. Joe and the Cobra Organization.
In this universe, Snake-Eyes is Storm Shadow's half-brother and a former Cobra agent. The African-American woman Carla "Doc" Greer, (an alternative version of the character Carl "Doc" Greer from the main continuity), is G.I. Joe's field medic, and Duke is an undercover Cobra agent who betrays the group. The series had no connection to the main comic series and was canceled after fourteen issues due to low sales.
G.I. Joe: Sigma 6.
"" was a six-issue mini-series written for a younger audience, based on the toyline and animated TV series of the same name. While the series was out of continuity with the main comic universe, the characters are largely the same: Hawk is the commanding officer, Duke is the field leader, and there is a connection between the ninjas Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow.
IDW Publishing.
After Devil's Due lost the G.I. Joe comics license in January 2008, the license was given to IDW Publishing, which was officially announced on May 29, 2008. IDW's G.I. Joe series is a complete reboot of the property, ignoring the continuity from the Marvel and Devil's Due incarnations of the comic.
G.I. Joe.
Issue #0 was released in October 2008, containing three stand-alone stories which acted as previews for the main G.I. Joe series, the "G.I. Joe: Origins" and "G.I. Joe: Cobra" spin-off mini-series. The #0 issue is followed by an ongoing monthly "G.I. Joe" series, written by Chuck Dixon, and drawn by Robert Atkins, which started in January 2009. After issue #27, the series was rebooted in April 2011 with a new #0.
"G.I. Joe: Origins" was an ongoing series that started in February 2009, and ended with issue #23 in January 2011. The first five issues, written by Larry Hama with art by Tom Feister and Mike Hawthorne, focus on the formation of the G.I. Joe team several years before the events of the main series. After this story arc, rotating creative teams - featuring creators such as JT Krul, Joe Benitez, Marc Andreyko and Ben Templesmith - took over the title to focus on origin and background tales of individual Joe and Cobra operatives.
"", co-written by Christos Gage and Mike Costa and drawn by Antonio Fuso, was a four-issue mini-series that started in March 2009 and focused on the inner working of the Cobra Organization as viewed through the eyes of undercover G.I. Joe agent Chuckles. By the end of the series, Chuckles is forced to kill his handler, Jinx, and loses contact with his Joe superiors. A "G.I. Joe Cobra II" mini-series began in January 2010, picking up with General Hawk recruiting a new—also female and Japanese—soldier to recover Chuckles. It was later upgraded to an ongoing series that ended in February 2011 with issue #13. A new #1 is scheduled for May 2011.
"G.I. Joe: Special" is a series of one-shot issues focusing on different characters. So far, only a "Helix Special" was published in August 2009.

Christmas Evans

Christmas Evans (25 December 1766 – 19 July 1838) was a Welsh Nonconformist minister, regarded as one of the greatest preachers in the history of Wales.
Life.
Evans was born near the village of Llandysul, Ceredigion. His father, a shoemaker, died early, and the boy grew up as an illiterate farm labourer. At the age of seventeen, he became the servant of a Presbyterian minister, David Davies. Under the influence of a contemporary religious revival, he learned to read and write in English and Welsh. The itinerant Calvinistic Methodist preachers and the members of the Baptist church at Llandyssul further influenced him, and he soon joined the latter denomination.
In 1789 he went into North Wales as a preacher and settled for two years on the remote Llŷn peninsula, Caernarfonshire, from where he moved to Llangefni in Anglesey. Here, on a stipend of £17 a year, supplemented by the selling of tracts, he built up a strong Baptist community, modelling his organization to some extent on that of the Calvinistic Methodists. Many new chapels were built, the money being collected on preaching tours which Evans undertook in South Wales. In 1826 Evans accepted an invitation from a congregation at Caerphilly, where he remained for two years, moving on from there in 1828 to Cardiff. In 1832, in response to urgent calls from the north, he settled in Caernarfon and again undertook the old work of building and collecting. He was taken ill on a tour in South Wales, in 1838, and died at Swansea.
In spite of his early disadvantages and personal disfigurement (he had lost an eye in a youthful brawl), Evans was a remarkably powerful preacher. To a natural aptitude for this calling he united a nimble mind and an inquiring spirit; his character was simple, his piety humble and his faith fervently evangelical. For a time he came under Sandemanian influence, and when the Wesleyans entered Wales he took the Calvinist side in the bitter controversies that were frequent between 1800 and 1810. His chief characteristic was a vivid and affluent imagination, which absorbed and controlled his other abilities, and earned for him the name "The Bunyan of Wales".
Works.
His works were edited by Owen Davies, in three volumes, and were published in Caernarvon between 1895 and 1897.

Bōkun Habanero

Bōkun Habanero is the brand name of a Japanese snack food. The name means "Tyrant Habanero", a reference to the habanero pepper, which is one of the world's hottest chili peppers. Its name derives from a play on words linking "habanero" with "Tyrant Nero".
The snack consists of potato rings, and is moderately spicy by Japanese standards.
The package features the brand mascot, Tyrant Habanero, a chili pepper with an evil or maniacal grin. The "bebiita" version features his younger sister, and the "bebinero" version features a younger version of the regular character.
Each 55g packet contains 297.3 calories.
Cultural references.
Bōkun Habanero is the focus of a popular Japanese internet meme that started on the popular Japanese internet Bulletin board system Futaba Channel. The meme revolves around an anthropomorphic caricature based on Bōkun Habanero and its mascot. The caricature, Habanero-tan, is a young, naive girl in a red dress who resembles the personification of an habanero pepper.

Nera River (Danube)

The Nera (, or Нера, ) is a long river running through Romania and Serbia, and the left tributary of the Danube.
Romania.
The Nera rises in the Semenic mountains, the easternmost part of the Banat region, south of the city of Reşiţa, in the Caraş-Severin County of Romania. The river starts at the junction of headwaters of the Nergana and Nerganiţa then flows straight to the south from the Piatra Grozbe peak, under which it springs. Reaching the village of Borlovenii Vechi, the Nera turns southwest, flowing between the Semenic and Banat Mountains. In this section, the Nera receives its left tributary, the Rudăria, and passes next to many villages (Prilipeț, Dalboșeț, Moceriș), until it reaches Șopotu-Nou, where it sharply turns to the northwest, still curving around the Semenic mountains. It passes next to the villages of Sasca Română, Sasca Montana, Slatina Nera and Naidăș, at which point it becomes the border between Romania and Serbia for the remaining .
Border River.
In the border section, the Nera flows through the depression of Bela Crkva (Belocrkvanska kotlina; Cyrillic: Белоцркванска котлина), and settlements on the Romanian side include Lescovița, Zlatița and Socol, while on the Serbian side there is only one village on the river itself, Kusić, with several settlements in the vicinity of the river: Kaluđerovo, the town of Bela Crkva, Vračev Gaj and Banatska Palanka. At Vračev Gaj the river turns south and empties into the Danube near the village of Stara Palanka.
In the final section, the Nera is wide with varying depths, and as the riverbed is made mostly of gravel, it spills over in series of limans, filled with murky waters. The mouth itself is a popular fishing spot.
The Nera drains an area of of the Black Sea drainage basin and it is not navigable.
Settlements located near the river.
In Romania: Prigor, Bozovici, Dalboşeţ, Şopotu Nou, Sasca Montană, Naidăş, Socol
In Serbia: Kusić, Bela Crkva, Vračev Gaj, Banatska Palanka, Stara Palanka

Anel Viário José Magalhães Teixeira

The Anel Viário José Magalhães Teixeira (official designation SP-083) is the Campinas Beltway, a ring of high-speed highways surrounding the city of Campinas, in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The Campinas Beltway is the Northern vertex of the Macrometropolitan Highway System of Greater São Paulo and one of the few complete metropolitan beltways in the country. It is an extensive structure, which directly interconnects 6 large double-lane highways to all quadrants of the state. Furthermore, it is superdimensioned, i.e., it has enough capacity to accommodate huge traffic loads without getting congested, even in peak hours.
The beltway itself is formed by a short (13 km) connection between the highways Rodovia Anhanguera and Rodovia Dom Pedro I, and those highways. They encircle the urban core of Campinas, with a total length of 42 km.
The highways directly connected to the Campinas hub are:
Less than 60 km from the hub, other important highways can be reached via high speed double-lane accesses from Campinas:
Through São Paulo City, the Campinas Beltway connects to the Southern vertex of the Macrometropolitan Ring of Sâo Paulo, to highways Rodovia dos Imigrantes, Rodovia Anchieta and Rodovia Régis Bittencourt.
The greatest part of the Campinas Beltway runs inside the urban zone (i.e., there are several highly populated sections of the cities of Campinas and Valinhos on the outside of the ring), thus its traffic is quite high. The highways which are part of it are now for all practical purposes used like urban avenues, with dozens of points of entrance, bridgeworks, viaducts, vicinal roads and streets, etc. The segments which comprise the ring are not tolled, due to a prohibition by the municipality of Campinas.
The region surrounding the beltway has one of the highest rates of urban growth and development in the city. Many high-technology companies have established their factories and offices alongside the Ring's highways, such as Lucent and Samsung. The majority of the city's shopping malls are also located along the Ring, such as the Dom Pedro, Campinas Outlet, Galleria and Iguatemi malls. In addition, the Ring's Northern and Eastern sections have witnessed a large and fast growth of luxury horizontal condominia, such as Alphaville and Gramado.
The structure is so named in honour of deceased, twice mayor of Campinas, Dr. José Roberto Magalhães Teixeira.

<doc id="2883337" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2883337" title="José Mari">
José Mari

José María Romero Poyón (born 10 December 1978), commonly known as José Mari, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a forward.
Over the course of 11 seasons he amassed La Liga totals of 270 games and 49 goals, mainly with Atlético Madrid – for which he signed at the age of 18 from Sevilla – and Villarreal (four years apiece). He also played in Italy for Milan.
Club career.
José Mari was born in Seville, Andalusia. After growing through the ranks of local Sevilla FC (first appearing with the main side aged just 18, in a 0–2 defeat at Rayo Vallecano on 5 March 1997, and making 21 La Liga appearances with seven goals during that season, as his team was finally relegated), he moved to Atlético de Madrid.
At Atlético, José Mari scored 18 league goals in his first two seasons combined. Highlights included scoring at both home and away wins against Real Madrid in the year 1999 (separate seasons, both by 3–1); these happened to be Atlético's only competitive victories in the Madrid derby in a span covering almost 20 years.
José Mari failed to settle in Italy after a big-money move to A.C. Milan in January 2000 (Atlético were relegated at the end of that season), and was subsequently loaned out to the "Colchoneros" during 2002–03 (Atlético's first back in the top flight after a two-year absence). His second spell there was less successful, with the high point being a hat-trick in a 3–3 home draw against Athletic de Bilbao on 10 November 2002.
José Mari moved to Villarreal CF in the summer of 2003, for an undisclosed fee, and went on to play a key role in that year's UEFA Intertoto Cup triumph and the club's best ever league finish (third in 2004–05, with four goals in 30 matches).
In 2007, after falling out of favour at Villarreal with the arrival of Giuseppe Rossi and the recovery of longtime injury absentee Nihat Kahveci, José Mari returned to Seville, joining Real Betis on a one-year deal. He scored his first goal for his new club more than a year after his arrival, on 24 September 2008, in a 2–3 defeat at FC Barcelona; despite still having a contract running until June 2010, he was released in late December and, late in the following month, moved to the second division and joined Gimnàstic de Tarragona.
In June 2010, after one 1/2 seasons of regular playing time, with six league goals in his last year, José Mari's contract expired and he was released. In the following month, the 31-year-old signed for Xerez CD, freshly relegated into level two. He netted a career-best 17 goals in his first season (33 games, all starts), helping his team to the eighth position.
International career.
José Mari represented Spain on four occasions in a two-year span. His debut came on 25 April 2001 as he played the second half of a 1–0 friendly win over Japan, in Córdoba.
Previously, José Mari was a member of the national squad which won the silver medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He scored three goals during the competition.
