Digby Fairweather

Digby Fairweather (born 25 April 1946, Rochford, Essex) is a British jazz cornettist and broadcaster.
Biography.
Digby Fairweather has been a full-time jazz musician since 1 January 1977, and he worked part-time for seven years before that with several local jazz bands in Essex and London. He recorded his first album in 1975 with Alex Welsh's band, as deputy for Welsh. When turning professional, Fairweather helped found the Keith Nichols Midnite Follies Orchestra. From 1978 he recorded solo albums, and joined a quartet known as Velvet, with guitarists Denny Wright and Ike Isaacs plus bassist Len Skeat. Before becoming a professional musician he was a librarian and has retained a strong interest in jazz bibliography and archiving.
In 1979, Fairweather became co-director of the non-profit Jazz College along with pianist Stan Barker. He also joined the Pizza Express All Stars. From 1983 he began leading bands of his own and helped to revitalise the Kettners Five, co-led with veteran double-bassist Tiny Winters. In 1983, Fairweather and Winters collaborated in a touring tribute to Nat Gonella, and they worked on various projects together over the next decade. Fairweather's musical style has been influenced by a number of artists, particularly Louis Armstrong, Ruby Braff, Billy Butterfield, Bobby Hackett, Red Nichols and Gonella. Digby’s Half Dozen was formed in 1995 and they toured and recorded with singer George Melly in the later years of his career (2003–07). Thereafter, Fairweather's band toured with former Manfred Mann lead singer Paul Jones in their presentation titled 'Rocking in Rhythm' (2007–present). Apart from his playing and bandleading, Fairweather has long pursued a parallel career as a broadcaster and writer on jazz.
From 1985 to 1988 he worked and recorded with Brian Priestley's Special Septet and Tony Milliner's Mingus Music, and he wrote the book "How to Play Trumpet". By 1990 he had embarked on a dual vocation as broadcaster for BFBS, BBC World Service, Jazz FM (1991–92) and BBC Radios 2/3 (1992–98), including occasionally deputising for Humphrey Lyttelton on the show "Best of Jazz" and successively presenting "Jazz Parade" and "Jazz Notes". In 1987 Fairweather founded the Association of British Jazz Musicians and the National Jazz Archive. That same year he formed the Jazz Superkings (with Dave Shepherd, Brian Lemon, Allan Ganley, "et al"). Fairweather also helped bring jazz musicians into the British Musicians' Union by proposing, then founding, its Jazz Section in 1992. In 1994 (with trombonist Pete Strange) he co-founded The Great British Jazz Band and continues to teach and do solo work. Following the death of Humphrey Lyttelton, he was invited to succeed Lyttelton as the Patron of the Birmingham International Jazz Festival. In 2013 he continues to lead his Half Dozen (winners of the Best Small Group category at the 2012 British Jazz Awards) and to perform as a soloist.

Mrs. John L. Strong

Mrs. John L. Strong is a privately held American luxury company and manufacturer of custom papers and stationery. Founded in 1929 by Mrs. John L. (Flora) Strong, the company has created papers and custom luxury products for seven presidential families, royal houses, prominent members of international society, film stars and celebrities. Called the "ne plus ultra of chic stationery companies," Mrs. John L. Strong has an important international clientele.
Mrs. Strong offers hand-engraving to its clients. Mrs. Strong's bespoke products display a range of crafts which are rarely used by others in the industry, including hand engraving of dies in steel, hand-stamping of dies, hand-mixing of custom varnish inks, hand-beveling and bordering, and hand-lining of envelopes. Mrs. Strong creates its own 100% cotton archival quality papers in its signature color "Strong's Vanilla" based on Mrs. Strong's original formulas.
History.
Mrs. John L. Strong (née Flora Feldstein) established her eponymous firm in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929. Joining forces with her sister, the owner of a luxury trousseau shop called Bournefield Linens, Mrs. Strong began selling wedding and social papers to New York's elite from Bournefield's location at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue.
Mrs. Strong's business soon outstripped the space at Bournefield, and she moved her location twice, first to 714 Madison Avenue, and later to the landmark 699 Madison Avenue, originally built as a New York home for the firm Fortnum & Mason, where the firm remains with a fifth floor atelier for private clients and a duplex ground floor boutique.
Mrs. Strong joined the "Street of Shops" on the first floor at Henri Bendel's in the 1950s. Mrs. Strong also sold through Gump's Department store in San Francisco. From her locations Mrs. Strong created papers for the Duke of Windsor and Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor, Barbara Hutton, the Rockefeller, Astor, Vanderbilt, and DuPont families, as well as Bette Davis, Diana Vreeland, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, Barbara Paley, and other icons of style.
After the death of Mrs. Strong in 1979, the firm was sold by Strong's heirs to Robert and Joy Lewis. As director, Joy Lewis maintained Strong's standards of quality, refusing to adopt modern methods, and preserving vital techniques of the crafts of artist-engraving and hand-stamping. The Lewises brought master engraver Fred Diefenbach to the firm, where he created dies for twenty years before retiring from engraving in his 90's, leaving Mrs. Strong with one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of dies from the 19th through the 20th century. The firm now boasts a collection of thousands of artist-engraved dies.
In 2002, the company was purchased by financier Jeffrey Lubin and his wife, designer Nannette Brown. Since 2002, Brown has pioneered the launch of seasonal collections based on fashion trends, known as "ready to write" collections, and has expanded the offerings of the company at its various locations by creating new goods in leather and silver. The company continues to expand, attracting an ever-younger and more fashion-oriented clientele, including important fashion designers, architects, artists, and interior designers, in addition to its long-standing clientele of social and international leaders.
On May 21, 2009, Nannette Brown announced that she would close the business.
On September 29, 2009, Crane's New York Business reported that the brand had been purchased in an auction (after filing for Chapter 11 protection in the Southern District of New York in August) by Houston-based private equity firm J.P. Kotts & Co., under the name The 1929 Paper Co.

Eupatorium perfoliatum

Eupatorium perfoliatum or (Common) Boneset is a common perennial plant native to the Eastern United States and Canada, with a range from Nova Scotia to Florida, as well as from Louisiana and Texas through North Dakota. It is also called "agueweed", "feverwort" or "sweating-plant". It was introduced to American colonists by Indians who used the plant for breaking fevers by means of heavy sweating. It is nearly always found in low, wet areas and is often found near "Phalaris arundinacea" (Reed canary grass).
Description.
The "Eupatorium perfoliatum" plant grows about 1m tall, with leaves that clasp the stems and dense clusters of white heads held above the foliage.
The leaves growing together around the stem lead to a past superstition that wrapping the leaves in bandages around splints would help mend broken bones. Boneset also had other medical uses, and was a very common remedy in the United States in the 19th century. The common name boneset apparently derives from the plant's historical use in treating dengue fever (which is also known as breakbone).
"E. perfoliatum" can form hybrids with other species of the genus "Eupatorium", for example "Eupatorium serotinum".
Medicinal uses.
"Eupatorium perfoliatum" was used in the traditional medicine of Native Americans and extracts are now used in herbal medicine for fever and colds. The effects of "Eupatorium perfoliatum" have not been confirmed by clinical study. However, animal studies and "in vitro" experiments with plant extracts indicate possible anti-inflammatory effects and activity against "Plasmodium falciparum", the parasite that causes malaria.
Butterflies.
"Eupatorium perfoliatum" is a specific Butterfly food and habitat plant.

Henderson Hall (Arlington, Virginia)

Henderson Hall is a military installation of the United States Marine Corps (USMC) located in Arlington County, Virginia, near the Pentagon, on the southern edge of the Arlington National Cemetery and next to Fort Myer. Currently, it is part of Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. Henderson Hall is named for Brevet Brigadier General Archibald Henderson, the fifth and longest-serving Commandant of the Marine Corps.
History of Henderson Hall.
Most of the land occupied by Henderson Hall was originally owned by the Syphax family. Maria Custis Syphax, the matriarch of the family, was the mulatto daughter of George Washington Parke Custis, grandson of Martha Washington and founder of the Arlington Estate on the banks of the Potomac River (later the home of Robert E. Lee). The Spyhax family sold the land to John Dormoyle in 1901, who then sold it to Frederick Rice in 1924.
Much of the rest of the land beneath Henderson Hall was part of the Arlington Estate as well. In 1941, the federal government built a temporary warehouse on this land, calling Federal Office Building No. 2. It quickly was converted into office space for use by the U.S. Navy, and informally renamed the Navy Annex.
The USMC headquarters moved to the Navy Annex in November 1941. A Headquarters and Service Company was organized on March 1, 1942, and a Women Marine Company (part of the United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve) organized as part of the Headquarters unit on April 1, 1943. To house both companies, the Marine Corps began acquiring, through purchase, easement, eminent domain, and other means, property to the west and northwest of the Navy Annex Building. This included most of the Syphax land, except for that already purchased by Abbey Mausoleum. Henderson Hall was built on this property in September 1943 to house both companies. All told, were acquired, and athletic fields, a bowling alley, chapel, firing range, gas station, gym, hobby shop, officers' and enlisted men's clubs, post exchange, post office, radio station, supply depot, and swimming pool were all built on the site.
The Women's Reserve was released from active duty in August 1946, and the women's barracks at Henderson Hall renovated into billeting space for male Marines.
Land acquisition ended in 1952, and on February 1, 1954, the state of Virginia executed a document ceding political jurisdiction over the land to the U.S. federal government.
About Henderson Hall today.
Covering of land, Henderson Hall is home to the USMC headquarters company unit and associated educational facilities. Since 2005, Henderson Hall is jointly managed by the Marine Corps and Fort Myer as a Myer-Henderson Hall.
Little at Henderson Hall is historic. All 19th and early 20th century buildings were demolished during its construction, and grading and construction at the site have destroyed whatever archeological artifacts might have existed. Nearly all the buildings on the campus today are from the late 20th century.

Essex pig

The Essex is a breed of domestic pig originating in the United Kingdom.
Characteristics.
The Essex, in its traditional form, was a smallish pig with 'pricked' ears and a black ground colour, with a broad band of white 'sheeting' across the shoulders.
History.
Like other old British pig breeds, the ancestor of the Essex may have originated in the county of the same name from selective breeding of local wild pigs. It was originally a smallish, 'coarse' black-and-white pig that was noted for being easy to keep and cheap to feed, qualities that ensured its popularity with smallholders. The Old Essex, as it came to be known, was deliberately 'improved' in the mid 19th century by crossing it with imported pigs.
The Essex pig remained locally popular until as recently as the mid 1950s, and had actually increased in numbers during the Second World War and immediately afterwards, based on its reputation for hardiness and its ability to feed itself by foraging. In 1954, 488 Essex boars (2% of the total British stock) were still licensed, and 3,716 sows registered.
The position of the Essex breed changed markedly after the publication of a 1955 report by the Advisory Committee on the Development of Pig Production in the United Kingdom, chaired by Sir Harold Howitt. The report, issued after the end of wartime rationing, expressed concern that the UK's pig farms were poorly placed to compete with European and Scandinavian pork and bacon producers, particularly those of Denmark, and identified that the wide variety of local breeds still used in the UK hampered development. It was therefore recommended that pig farmers concentrate on three breeds: the Welsh, the Landrace, and the Large White, and as a result the Essex pig went into a steep decline.
While the breed societies of the Wessex (another breed featuring a black ground colour and white shoulder markings, although with a different origin) and Essex pigs had amalgamated as early as 1918, the formal end of the Essex pig came in 1967, when the stud books were also amalgamated with the intention of merging the two breeds into the British Saddleback. This was intended to improve the breed's characteristics, produce hybrid vigour, and prevent inbreeding in the remaining small herds. For many years the Essex pig was considered to have become extinct in 1967, although it was thought a few pure-bred individuals might survive on small farms. 
Re-creation of the breed.
Later research showed that one farmer, John Croshaw, had refused to amalgamate his herd of Essex pigs (the "Glascote Herd"), which retained a pure Essex bloodline despite being officially registered as British Saddlebacks: Croshaw had carefully managed his stock to avoid inbreeding. The Essex Pig Society was formed in 1997, and since that time Jimmy Doherty and Michaela Furney of Jimmy's Farm have made further efforts to publicise and re-establish the breed.

Good Life Delivery

Good Life Delivery () is a 2004 Argentine, French, and Dutch film, directed by Leonardo Di Cesare, and written by Di Cesare and Hans Garrino. The film features Ignacio Toselli as Hernán, Mariana Anghileri as Pato, and Oscar Nuñez as Venancio, Pato's manipulative father, among others. The film was partly funded by INCAA.
Plot.
This black comedy is about average people who live in González Catán, a working-class suburb southwest of Buenos Aires, and are having a hard time making a living.
In the beginning, Hernán helps his brother and his wife get ready for a their big move to Spain. His parents are forced to leave Argentina in order to escape the ravages of the country's economic crisis. Hernán is left alone in the Buenos Aires suburbs. He works at an agency delivering messages on a small motorcycle. One day, at a gas station, he meets Pato, an attractive woman working the pumps. Hernán invites Pato to rent the room his brother vacated.
Pato is a mysterious young woman. She realizes Hernán likes her and she decides to go along in returning his advances. Yet, Hernán is quite surprised when he comes home one night. Pato's parents and her young daughter have moved in without giving Hernán a warning. The father, Venancio (Oscar Nuñez), a slick character, thanks Hernán, who thinks the move-in is temporary.
However, it seems that Pato's parents have come to stay. Dispossession laws in Argentina can be quite lengthly and costly. Venancio and his wife turn the kitchen into a small bakery making churros that are sold on the streets. Nothing that Hernán does to get rid of Pato's family who occupy the house. That is until he takes matters into his own hands and scares Pato's family.
Pato, who is not able to have a relationship with Hernán, is being pursued by a handsome young man, Jose Luis, a client at the gas station. Pato realizes a her chance when she discovers that Jose Luis is much wealthier than Hernán. Venancio, his wife, and the young girl appear at Jose Luis' building. In the next scene, Venancio is seated at the dinner table thanking Jose Luis with the same speech he used to thank Hernán.
Background.
The film's backdrop is the economic crisis Argentina faced from 1999-2002. The poverty rate of Argentina grew from an already high 35.9% in May 2001 to a peak of 57.5% in October 2002. In addition, the May 2000 unemployment rate was 15.4%; it climbed to 18.3% in December 2001.
Distribution.
The picture was first presented at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in the Netherlands on January 27, 2004. Later it was shown at the Toulouse Latin America Film Festival in France on March 22, 2004.
The film was screened at various film festivals, including: the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, Czech Republic; the "Rencontres Internationales de Cinéma à Paris"; France; Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival, South Korea; Copenhagen International Film Festival, Denmark; the Biarritz La Cita Film Festival, France; the Chicago International Film Festival, USA; the Valladolid International Film Festival, Spain; and others.
Critical reception.
Deborah Young, film critic for "Variety" magazine and reporting from the International Film Festival Rotterdam, liked the film and wrote, "Argentina's economic crisis furnishes fertile background material in "Buena Vida (Delivery)", a clever social drama spiked with black humor...Well-written and acted, pic vividly conveys the country's dire straits with clenched-teeth humor and compassion for all. It should benefit from the growing aud for Argentine product...From a low-key naturalistic drama, pic turns into an ironic comedy that catches the viewer up in seemingly unsolvable social and personal problems."
Film critic Ed Gonzalez, who writes for "Slant Magazine", liked the film and the way director Leonardo Di Cesare approached the material and wrote, "Nostalgia sweetly and sensitively tinges the sobering film's emotional politics, as it does in Leonardo Di Cesare's "Buena Vida Delivery", the story of a female gas station employee, Pato (Mariana Anghileri), who moves in with a young man, Hernán (Ignacio Toseli), whose parents leave Argentina in order to escape the ravages of the country's economic crisis. Infinitely more charming than Daniel Burman's self-obsessed "Lost Embrace", the film is a romantic comedy that accommodates the dejected mood of the country's people...where "Lost Embrace" worried only for its main character, "Buena Vida" frets for an entire nation."
British film critic K.H. Brown liked considered the film deeply ironic and wrote, "Making black comedy out of national economic disaster, the title of this Argentine drama can only be understood as deeply ironic. No one is being delivered a particularly good life. Rather, everyone is struggling to get by, doing what they feel is best for them and theirs...Straightforward, unflashy direction – one suddenly notices the previous absence of music when a few ominous chords signal the beginning of act three, for instance – is counterbalanced by well-observed and nuanced performances and a satisfactorily bittersweet resolution. If "Buena Vida Delivery" probably won't put film-maker Leonardo Di Cesare up there with the likes of Walter Salles and Gonzales Innaritu at the forefront of current Latin American cinema, it's a pleasing enough way to spend 90 minutes."

The Guns () is a 1964 Brazilian-Argentine drama film directed by Ruy Guerra. 
Plot.
The plot is divided into two stories; both are set in the Northeast Region of Brazil in 1963. In the first, peasant people follow a ox deemed as sacred, eating it in the end. The second story follows soldiers as they are sent to prevent poor people to plunder local warehouses. 
Production.
Originally, Ruy Guerra planned to film it on Greece but local authorities denied him from doing it in 1958. The plot would revolve around soldiers trying to defend a village from a pack of wolves. In 1964, he produced "The Guns", with its filming taking place in Bahia and adapting its screenplay to incorporate Brazilian culture elementes. 
Reception.
It was entered into the 14th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear Extraordinary Jury Prize. "The New York Times" called it "exceptionally good".

Juanelo Turriano

Juanelo Turriano (; born Giovanni Torriani, c. 1500 — 1585) was an Italo-Spanish clockmaker, engineer and mathematician. He was born in Cremona.
Called to Spain in 1529 by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, he was appointed "Court Clock Master" and built the "Cristalino", an astronomical clock that made him famous in his time. Philip II of Spain named him "Matemático Mayor". He worked and lived in Toledo, where he built the "Artificio de Juanelo", an engine that, driven by the river itself, lifted water from the Tagus to a height of almost 100 meters, to supply the city and its castle (Alcázar).
Turriano is attributed as the creator of the "Clockwork Prayer", an automaton representing a monk manufactured in the 1560s based on a commission from Philip II of Spain. Another automaton associated with Turriano is a figure of a lady playing a lute housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.
He died at Toledo in 1585.

Protocadherin

Protocadherins (Pcdhs) are the largest mammalian subgroup of the cadherin superfamily of homophilic cell-adhesion proteins. They were discovered by Shintaro Suzuki's group, when they used PCR to find new members of the cadherin family. The PCR fragments that corresponded to Protocadherins were found in vertebrate and invertebrate species This prevalence in a wide range of species suggested that the fragments were part of an ancient cadherin and were thus termed "Protocadherins" as the "first cadherins" although, of the approximately 70 Pcdhs genes identified in mammalian genomes, over 50 are located in tightly linked gene clusters on the same chromosome and this kind of organisation and genes can only be found in vertebrates.
In mammals, two type of Pcdh genes have been defined: the non-clustered Pcdhs which are scattered throughout the genome; and the clustered Pcdhs organized in three gene clusters designated α, β, γ which in mouse genome comprises 14, 22 and 22, respectively, large variable exons arrayed in tandem(Fig.1). Each exon is transcribed from its owner promoter and encodes: the entire extracellular domain; a transmembrane domain; and a short and variable intracellular domain of the corresponding Pcdh protein which differs from the Cadherin intracellular domain due to lack of attachment to the cytoskeleton through catenins(Fig.2).
Moreover, these clustered Pcdh genes are predominantly expressed in the developing nervous system and since different subsets of Pcdhs genes are differentially expressed in individual neurons, a vast cell surface diversity may arise from this combinatorial expression. This has led to speculation and further to the proposal that Pcdhs may provide a synaptic-address code for neuronal connectivity or a single-cell barcode for self-recognition/self-avoidance similar to that ascribed to DSCAM proteins of invertebrates. Although vertebrate DSCAMs lack the diversity of their invertebrate counterparts, the selective transcription of individual Pcdh isoforms can be achieved by promoter choice followed by alternative pre-mRNA cis-splicing thus increasing the number of possible combinations.
Homophilic interactions and Intracellular signaling.
Clustered Pcdhs proteins are detected throughout the neuronal soma, dendrites and axons and are observed in synapses and growth cones. Like classical cadherins, members of Pcdhs family were also shown to mediate cell-cell adhesion in cell-based assays and most of them showed to engage in homophilic trans-interactions. 
Schreiner and Weiner showed that Pcdhα and γ proteins can form multimeric complexes. If all three classes of Pcdhs could engage in multimerization of stochastically expressed Pcdhs isoforms, then neurons could produce a large number of distinct homophilic interaction units, amplifying significantly the cell-surface diversity more than the one afforded by stochastic gene expression alone.
As for cytoplasmic domain, all the three classes of clustered Pcdhs proteins are dissimilar, although they are strictly conserved in vertebrate evolution, suggesting a conserved cellular function. This is corroborated by a large number of other interacting proteins including phosphatases, kinases, adhesion molecules and synaptic proteins Furthermore, it was shown that Pcdhs are proteolitically processed by γ-secretase complex, which releases soluble intracellular fragments into the cytoplasm which might have a broad range of functions as acting locally in the cytoplasm and/or even regulate gene expression similarly to other cell-surface proteins such as Notch and N-cadherin. 
Since these molecules are involved in so many developmental processes like axon guidance and dendrite ariborization, mutations in Pcdhs genes and their expression may play a role in Down, Rett as well as Fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases

Chronicle of a Boy Alone

Chronicle of a Boy Alone (), also known as Chronicle of a Lonely Child, is a 1965 Argentine film directed by Leonardo Favio. It won the Silver Condor Award for Best Film.
Plot.
Polin is an eleven-year-old troublemaker in reform school for unknown reasons. After suffering from harsh treatment at the hands of the staff there, Polin finally reaches a breaking point and snaps, punching one of the supervisors in the face. He is then sent to the police station where he is locked up in a cell and left alone. Polin soon breaks out and travels back to his hometown, a rural fishing village, where he meets up with his best friend and falls back into his old routine—smoking, pickpocketing, shoplifting, skinny dipping with his friends and picking fights with the neighborhood bullies—all the while trying to avoid a run-in with the law, which he knows is inevitable.
Reception.
Controversy.
While on the surface a film about children, at the time of its release in 1965 the film was viewed by many as a critique on Argentina's fascist regime. In addition to this, the film's brutal and realistic depiction of Argentina's state-run orphanages at the time caused a great deal of controversy.
The film also contains a controversial scene containing extensive, explicit nudity involving several young Argentine boys skinny dipping.
This controversy led the Argentine Government to ban the film shortly after its release. The film remained banned for over thirty years.
Release.
In 1996, over three decades after being banned, the film was finally released on VHS by Award Films International, and later on DVD.

Moon Lee

Moon Lee Choi-Fung (; born 14 February 1965) is a former Hong Kong actress who frequently played roles related to the action and martial arts genre in TV serials and films. She was particularly notable in the sub-genre known as girls with guns.
Biography.
From age 6 to 12, Lee lived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan for 6 years with her father, who had business there. She attended Youchang Elementary School. During her stay in Taiwan, she learned Mandarin Chinese and developed her piano and dance expertise. As a result, she often had performances.
When she first returned to Hong Kong to attend middle school, her Cantonese was not perfect and she was sort of rustic. At age 15, Lee was accidentally discovered by a television director, Hsiao Hsianhui, during a school dancing performance. She was recommended to play a role in a television series "Fatherland". Since the play did not require too much of her time and she could still study at school, her parents agreed to let her play. In the series, she was a country girl, by the name of A Mun, who looked just like Lee. Ever since then, people liked to call her A Mun. Her performance in the series was so impressive that she began her career as an actress. Since she has been practicing dances from her childhood, it is easy for her to perform action movies with her agile and flexible movements. After her first martial art movie in ancient costumes (Zu Warriors from the magic Mountain), she has not left the stage of action movies.
At 18, freshly graduated from middle school, she signed contracts with both Asia Television Limited and Golden Harvest. Lee Choi Fung was sent to Japan to make an advertisement for Mitsubishi automobile company. The company asked her to pick an English name. She chose Moon, as the pronunciation of Mun in Cantonese is close to the English word, Moon.
She played in many television series, exceeding 400 episodes. Subsequently she focused her efforts wholly on movies, mostly action movies.
In the late 1990s, she gradually left the movie field and was passionately involved in the promotion of the art of dance and established a dancing school to cultivate talented dancers. Her students won excellent awards in Hong Kong dance competitions.
Stunt accident.
While performing the final stunt in Devil Hunters (1989), Lee sustained a third degree burn. Lee was supposed to jump off a window from a second story building to evade an explosion. Due to bad timing by the pyrotechnicians, she was engulfed in flames before she jumped down, resulting in severe burns to her hands and face. The epilogue of the film accounts the details about the accident, along with a message of commendation from the director for her courage and hardwork.

Watkins Glacier

The Watkins Glacier is a glacier situated on the southeastern flank of Mount Shasta, in the U.S. state of California. It occupies a small cirque in the Clear Creek drainage. It is the smallest officially-named glacier on Mount Shasta, and it was not accorded that status until 1976, following a decades-long campaign by local resident R. Harry Watkins, Jr., to bring recognition to the previously-ignored glacier. 
The Watkins is one of three small cirque glaciers on the southern side of Shasta, along with the Konwakiton and Mud Creek Glaciers located about west. It has the lowest average elevation of any of Shasta's glaciers, extending only between .
In 2002, scientists made the first detailed survey of Mount Shasta's glaciers in 50 years. They found that seven of the glaciers (including the Watkins) have grown over the period 1951-2002, with the Hotlum and Wintun Glaciers nearly doubling, the Bolam Glacier increasing by half, and the Whitney and Konwakiton Glaciers growing by a third.

Albertino Mussato

Albertino Mussato (1261 – 31 May 1329) was an Early Renaissance Italian statesman, poet, historian and dramatist credited with providing an impetus to the revival of literary Latin. He was a pupil of Italian poet and humanist Lovato Lovati.
A native of Padua, a major city in the northern Veneto region, Mussato was a chronicler of his times, whose 1315 Latin verse play "Ecerinis", based on the tyrannical career of Ezzelino III da Romano, was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times and so is considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. Its literary and political qualities earned Albertino a crown as Poet Laureate, a revival of an antique custom, partly at the prompting of Rolando della Piazzola.
In addition to his prolific writings, he is also remembered in contemporary accounts as a champion of poetry which he defended in a 1317 polemical exchange of letters with a Dominican friar, Giovannino of Mantua.
Albertino Mussato died in Chioggia in the year of his 68th birthday.

Elitserien (speedway)

Elitserien (literally, "The Elite League") () is the highest league in the league system of speedway in Sweden and currently comprises the top 9 Swedish speedway teams. The first season began in 1982. Before that Allsvenskan was the highest division.
History.
From the start of Swedish league speedway in 1948 until 1981 the highest speedway league in Sweden was Division 1, in those days commonly known as Allsvenskan. But in 1982 Elitserien was formed, consisting of only six teams where the top four teams qualified for the play offs. Getingarna became the first winners after defeating Njudungarna in the finals. The league size was increased to seven teams in 1983 and to eight teams in 1984, a league size that was maintained until the 1996 season when the league expanded to nine teams and then to ten teams the following season. In 1986 the play offs lost its championship status and instead the winner of the league became Swedish champions. However, in 2000, play offs was reintroduced as a championship final.
Rules.
Play offs.
The play offs decides the winner of the Swedish Speedway Team Championship. It is run in three rounds; quarter finals, semi finals and final. The first six teams of the main series are split into two quarter final groups with three teams each. The two best teams in the quarter final groups qualifies for the semi finals. In the semi finals and the final the teams meet once home and once away. The team with the highest rider points aggregate after two matches goes through to the next round.
Squads.
Each team has a squad of nine riders with an initial match average above 2,00 and an unlimited number of riders with an initial match average of 2,00. In addition most teams has a farm club agreement with a team in another league which makes it possible to farm Swedish riders with an Elitserien initial match average less than or equal to 6,00. A team can use a maximum of two riders from the farm club in each match.
Team selection.
To each match a team has to select seven riders from its squad. The selected team must include at least one Swedish junior rider (under 21). The total initial match average of the team must not exceed 42,00 and not be lower than 35,00. The two riders with the lowest consecutive match average must be placed as reserves in jackets number 6 and 7. An additional reserve can be added to the team in jacket number 8 if the rider is a Swedish junior rider and has a lower consecutive match average than all other riders in the team. The 8th rider has no scheduled rides.
Initial match average.
In the beginning of each season, each rider in the league is provided an initial match average by the Swedish motorcycle sports association, Svemo. This average remains unchanged throughout the season and is used for team selection.
Calculation of initial match averages.
From the 2010 season a riders initial match average is equal to the Calculated Match Average of the last season the rider competed in the Swedish league system. Before 2010 the last consecutive match average was used.
The first initial match average for a Swedish rider that has not yet competed in the Swedish league system is 2,00. Foreign riders that has not yet competed for a Swedish team get a first initial match average equal to the rider's last official home league average, bonus points excluded. Since some foreign leagues are not of the same quality as the Swedish leagues the initial match averages for foreign riders are modified by multiplying it to a factor according to the table below. However, a foreign rider cannot be awarded a first initial match average below 5,00.
Consecutive match average.
A rider's consecutive match average is calculated after each match and is used to determine which riders that are allowed to race as reserves in a match. The last consecutive match average of the season becomes the initial match average for the next season.
Calculation of consecutive match average.
At the start of the season the consecutive match average is equal to the initial match average. The consecutive match average is calculated according to the following formula
formula_1
"Where:"
N is the New consecutive match average
C is the Current consecutive match average
M is the total number of league rounds
I is the first consecutive match average of the season. i.e. the Initial match average
p is the total points in the latest match
h is the number of heats the rider participated in in the latest match
The new consecutive match average is rounded down to two decimals.
"Example:"
A rider has a current consecutive match average (C) on 8,11 and an initial match average (I) on 7,76. In the following match he rides 5 heats (h) scoring 14 points (p). The number of rounds in his league (M) is 12. This leaves the rider with a new consecutive match average on 8,39

Lake Cadagno

Lake Cadagno (Italian: "Lago di Cadagno") is a meromictic lake in the Piora valley (canton of Ticino), Switzerland. As one of a few meromictic lakes in Europe, it is the object of numerous scientific studies. The Piora valley - located in the Gotthard massif (central Swiss Alps) in the Southern part of Switzerland near Airolo at an altitude of 2000 m above sea level - is a landlocked alpine valley whose scientific value has been recognized for more than two centuries. In the past, the lake was used as a reservoir.
Lake Cadagno is a rare example of crenogenic meromixis. Its waters show a permanent stratification due to a natural geological phenomenon. The lower abounds with dissolved mineral salts (sulphate, magnesium, calcium, carbonate) originating from sublacustrine springs, whereas the separate upper layer is permanently oxygenated. Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria – among them "Chromatium okenii" -- thrive between the two layers where they find the ideal conditions for their development. Such an ecosystem provides a good opportunity to study the metabolisms connected with eutrophication on a stable model, as it is well known that one of the advanced stages of eutrophication is biogenic meromixis.
Research.
For the last 25 years the area has been increasingly used for scientific purposes, both for teaching and researching various environmental subjects. In view of stimulating educational and scientific activities at a university level, the Alpine Biology Center (ABC) has been set up by the Canton of Ticino, in cooperation with the universities of Geneva and Zurich. For this purpose, two 16th century buildings of the Alpe Piora have been turned into a laboratory and lodgings. The Microbiology Institute of the canton of Ticino is responsible both for managing the center and coordinating its activities.
Cyclobotryococcatriene, a botryococcene-related hydrocarbon, was isolated from and identified in organic-rich sediments in Lake Cadagno in 2000.

Leonardo City Tower Hotel () is the third-tallest building in Israel and the tallest hotel (although it also contains residential apartments). It was the tallest building in Ramat Gan from its construction in 2000, until 2001, when it was surpassed by the Moshe Aviv Tower.
History.
The Leonardo City Tower was constructed from a design which won first place in a competition. The construction rate of the tower was incredibly quick with one story every five days, without failure. The building was completed in 2000 and operated as a Sheraton until 2009, when it joined the Leonardo chain. The building also contains 200 apartments which boast the benefits of hotel service.
Apartments.
The 200 apartments in the tower can access the hotel service from below, in addition to their own entrance to the building through a mini-mall.
Hotel.
The Leonardo City Tower hotel operates on fourteen of the forty-two floors of the tower. Under the instructions of Sheraton, there is no thirteenth floor in the building, so the hotel operates from floors four to eighteen. The hotel has 167 guest units, including a Smart Presidential Suite, 31 Smart Executive Suites, 69 Smart Rooms and 66 Deluxe Rooms. The Sheraton City Tower was the first 5-star hotel in Ramat Gan.

Dating

Dating is a part of human mating process whereby two people meet socially for companionship, beyond the level of friendship, or with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a partner in an intimate relationship or marriage. It can be a form of courtship consisting of social activities done by the couple. While the term has several meanings, it usually refers to the act of meeting and engaging in some mutually agreed upon social activity in public, together, as a couple.
The protocols and practices of dating, and the terms used to describe it, vary considerably from country to country, and vary from time to time. The most common idea is two people trying out a relationship and exploring whether they are compatible by "going out together" in public as a couple who may or may not yet be having sexual relations. This period of courtship is sometimes seen as a precursor to engagement or marriage.
History.
Dating as an institution is a relatively recent phenomenon which has mainly emerged in the last few centuries. From the standpoint of anthropology and sociology, dating is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the family which have also been changing rapidly and which have been subject to many forces, including advances in technology and medicine. As humans have evolved from the hunter-gatherers into civilized societies and more recently into modern societies, there have been substantial changes in the relationship between men and women, with perhaps the only biological constant being that both adult women and men must have sexual intercourse for human procreation to happen.
Humans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior. Neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being tournament species, in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females, and pair bond arrangements, in which a male and female will bond for life. According to Sapolsky, humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum, in the sense that humans form pair bonds, but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners. These species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of human reproduction, including dating. However, one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction. In modern times, emphasis on the institution of marriage, generally described as a male-female bond, has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transsexual couples, and the fact that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring, or that often pairs that do have offspring separate. Thus, the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries.
Historically, marriages in most societies were arranged by parents and older relatives with the goal not being love but legacy and "economic stability and political alliances," according to anthropologists. Accordingly, there was little need for a temporary trial period such as dating before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman. While pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements, marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature, where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband, and who would have to serve the function of reproduction. Communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as Europe; in China, according to sociologist Tang Can, society "demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship" and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating children as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates.
Generally, during much of recorded history of humans in civilization, and into the Middle Ages in Europe, weddings were seen as business arrangements between families, while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly, such as covert meetings. The 12th-century book "The Art of Courtly Love" advised that "True love can have no place between husband and wife." According to one view, clandestine meetings between men and women, generally outside of marriage or before marriage, were the precursors to today's dating.
From about 1700, however, according to professor David Christian of Macquarie University in Australia in a course entitled "Big History", a worldwide movement perhaps described as the "empowerment of the individual" took hold, leading to the emancipation of women and the equality of individuals. Men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. Women won the right to vote and own property and receive equal treatment by the law, and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women. Parental influence declined. In many societies, individuals could decide––on their own––whether they should marry, who they should marry, and when they should marry. A few centuries ago, dating was sometimes described as a "courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, under the watchful eye of a chaperone," but increasingly, in many Western countries, it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together. Still, dating varies considerably by nation, custom, religious upbringing, technology, and social class, and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages, request dowries, and forbid same-sex pairings. Although in many countries, movies, meals, meeting in coffeehouses and other places is now popular, as are advice books suggesting various strategies for men and women 
in other parts of the world, such as in South Asia and many parts of the Middle East, being alone in public as a couple with another person is not only frowned upon but can even lead to either person being socially ostracized.
In the twentieth century, dating was sometimes seen as a precursor to marriage but it could also be considered as an end-in-itself, that is, an informal social activity akin to friendship. It generally happened in that portion of a person's life before the age of marriage, but as marriage became less permanent with the advent of divorce, dating could happen at other times in peoples lives as well. People became more mobile. Rapidly developing technology played a huge role: new communication technology such as the telephone, Internet and text messaging enabled dates to be arranged without face-to-face contact. Cars extended the range of dating as well as enabled back-seat sexual exploration. In the mid twentieth century, the advent of birth control as well as safer procedures for abortion changed the equation considerably, and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges. New types of relationships formed; it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without having to deal with children. Information about human sexuality grew, and with it an acceptance of all types of sexual orientations is becoming more common. Today, the institution of dating continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up.
Dating as a social relationship.
Wide variation in behavior patterns.
Social rules regarding dating vary considerably according to variables such as country, social class, religion, age, sexual orientation and gender. Behavior patterns are generally unwritten and constantly changing. There are considerable differences between social and personal values. Each culture has particular patterns which determine such choices as whether the man asks the woman out, where people might meet, whether kissing is acceptable on a first date, the substance of conversation, who should pay for meals or entertainment, or whether splitting expenses is allowed. Among the Karen people in Burma and Thailand, women are expected to write love poetry and give gifts to win over the man. Since dating can be a stressful situation, there is the possibility of humor to try to reduce tensions. For example, director Blake Edwards wanted to date singing star Julie Andrews, and he joked in parties about her persona by saying that her "endlessly cheerful governess" image from movies such as "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music" gave her the image of possibly having "lilacs for pubic hair"; Andrews appreciated his humor, sent him lilacs, dated him and later married him, and the couple stayed together for 41 years until his death in 2010.
Different meanings of the term.
While the term "dating" has many meanings, the most common refers to a trial period in which two people explore whether to take the relationship further towards a more permanent relationship; in this sense, dating refers to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date, perhaps by corresponding by email or text or phone. Another meaning of the term "dating" is to describe a stage in a person's life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people. If two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together, they are often described as "dating" which means they were seen in public together, and it is not clear whether they are merely friends, exploring a more intimate relationship, or are romantically involved.
Evaluation.
One of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one another’s suitability as a long term companion or spouse. Often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and as a result feelings can be hurt, and confidence shaken. Because of the uncertainty of the whole situation, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection, dating can be very stressful for all parties involved.
While some of what happens on a date is guided by an understanding of basic rules, there is considerable room to experiment, and there are numerous sources of advice available.
There are now more than 500 businesses worldwide that offer dating coach services—with almost 350 of those operating in the U.S. And the number of these businesses has surged since 2005 Frequency of dating varies by person and situation; among singles actively seeking partners, 36% had been on no dates in the past three months, 13% had one date, 22% had two to four dates and 25% had five or more dates, according to a 2005 U.S. survey. Traumatic events can sometimes cause people to start dating; for example, two passengers aboard US Airways Flight 1549, which crashed in the Hudson River but without loss of life, began dating afterwards.
Meeting places.
There are numerous ways to meet potential dates, including blind dates, classified ads, dating websites, hobbies, holidays, office romance, social networking, speed dating, and others. A Pew study in 2005 which examined Internet users in long-term relationships including marriage, found that many met by contacts at work or at school. The survey found that 55% of relationship-seeking singles agreed that it was "difficult to meet people where they live." One writer suggested that meeting possible partners was easier in pedestrian-oriented cities such as Berlin or Barcelona rather than Los Angeles since there were more chances for face-to-face contact. Work is a common place to meet potential spouses, although there are some indications that the Internet is overtaking the workplace as an introduction venue. Some couples met because they lived in the same building and shared a common bathroom. Hobbies can be an informal way for people to meet. In Britain, one in five marry a co-worker, but half of all workplace romances end within three months. In India, there are incidents of people meeting future spouses in the workplace. One drawback of office dating is that a bad date can lead to "workplace awkwardness."
Gender differences.
There is general perception that men and women approach dating differently, hence the reason why advice for each sex varies greatly, particularly when dispensed by popular magazines. For example, it is a common belief that heterosexual men often seek women based on beauty and youth. Psychology researchers at the University of Michigan suggested that men prefer women who seem to be "malleable and awed", and prefer younger women with subordinate jobs such as secretaries and assistants and fact-checkers rather than executive-type women. Online dating patterns suggest that men are more likely to initiate online exchanges (over 75%) and extrapolate that men are less "choosy", seek younger women, and "cast a wide net". In a similar vein, the stereotype for heterosexual women is that they seek well-educated men who are their age or older with high-paying jobs. Evolutionary psychology suggests that "women are the choosier of the genders" since "reproduction is a much larger investment for women" who have "more to lose by making bad choices."
All of these are examples of gender stereotypes which plague dating discourse and shape individuals' and societies' expectations of how heterosexual relationships should be navigated. In addition to the deterimental effects of upholding limited views of relationships and sexual and romantic desires, stereotypes also lead to framing social problems a problematic way. For example, some have noted that educated women in many countries including Italy and Russia and the United States find it difficult to have a career as well as raise a family, prompting a number of writers to suggest how women should approach dating and how to time their careers and personal life. Yet the advice comes with the assumption that the work-life balance is inherently a "woman's problem". In many societies there is a view that women should fulfill the role of primary caregivers, with little to no spousal support and with few services by employers or government such as parental leave or child care. Accordingly, an issue regarding dating is the subject of career timing which generates controversy. Some views reflect a traditional notion of gender roles. For example, Danielle Crittenden in "What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us" argued that having both a career and family at the same time was taxing and stressful for a woman; as a result, she suggested that women should date in their early twenties with a seriousness of purpose, marry when their relative beauty permitted them to find a reliable partner, have children, then return to work in their early thirties with kids in school; Crittenden acknowledged that splitting a career path with a ten-year baby-raising hiatus posed difficulties. There are contrasting views which suggest that women should focus on careers in their twenties and thirties. Columnist Maureen Dowd quoted comedian Bill Maher on the subject of differing dating agendas between men and women: "Women get in relationships because they want somebody to talk to -- men want women to shut up."
It is increasingly common today, however, with new generations and in a growing number of countries, to frame the work-life balance issue as a social problem rather than a gender problem. With the advent of a changing workplace, the increased participation of women in the labor force, an increasing number of men who are picking up their share of parenting and housework, and more and more governments and industries committing themselves to achieving gender equality, the question of whether or not, or when to start a family is slowly being recognized as an issue that touches (or should touch) both genders.
Love.
If there is any aspect of dating which is common for both sexes, then perhaps the idea of being in love can be scary; one said "being really intimate with someone in a committed sense is kind of threatening" and described love as "the most terrifying thing." In her Psychology Today column, research scientist, sex columnist and book author Debby Herbenick compared it to a roller coaster:
One dating adviser agreed that love is risky, and wrote that "There is truly only one real danger that we must concern ourselves with and that is closing our hearts to the possibility that love exists."
Controversy.
What happens in the dating world can reflect larger currents within popular culture. For example, when the 1995 book "The Rules" appeared, it touched off media controversy about how men and women should relate to each other, with different positions taken by "New York Times" columnist Maureen Dowd and British writer Kira Cochrane of "The Guardian". and others. It has even caused anthropologists such as Helen Fisher to suggest that dating is a game designed to "impress and capture" which is not about "honesty" but "novelty", "excitement" and even "danger", which can boost dopamine levels in the brain. The subject of dating has spun off popular culture terms such as the "friend zone" which refers to a situation in which a dating relation evolves into a platonic non-sexual union.
Stranger danger.
Since people dating often don't know each other well, there's the risk of violence, including date rape. According to one report, there was a 10% chance of violence between students happening between a boyfriend and girlfriend, sometimes described as "intimate partner violence", over a 12–month period. Another estimate was that 20% of U.S. high school girls aged 14–18 were "hit, slapped, shoved or forced into sexual activity". There is evidence that violence while dating isn't limited to any one culture or group or religion, but that it remains an issue in different countries. It is usually the female who is the victim, but there have been cases where males have been hurt as well. Sara McCorquodale suggests that women meeting strangers on dates meet initially in busy public places, share details of upcoming dates with friends or family so they know where they'll be and who they'll be with, avoid revealing one's surname or address, and conducting searches on them on the Internet prior to the date. One advisor suggested: Don't leave drinks unattended; have an exit plan if things go badly; and ask a friend to call you on your cell phone an hour into the date to ask how it's going. In some regions of the world, such as Chechnya, bride stealing is fairly common, enough to provoke leader Ramzan Kadyrov to urge young men to use persuasion instead. Kadyrov advised:
Technology.
The internet and several websites are shaping the way new generations date. Facebook, Skype, Whatsapp, and other applications like Lulu and Grindr have made remote connections possible. Particularly for the LGBTI community, where the dating pool can be more difficult to navigate because of discrimination and having a 'minority' status in society, online dating tools are an alternate way to meet potential dates. New software applications such as Grindr has also provided a means for gays to meet with other gays in close proximity.
Dating worldwide.
Dating customs and habits vary considerably throughout the world. The average duration of courtship before proceeding to engagement or marriage varies considerably throughout the world.
Africa.
Ethiopia.
One Ethiopian writer described a couple, when dating, as happy, at parties and movies and recreation centers and swimming pools, while they appeared to be less so after being married; still the writer thought marriage was the "lesser of two evils" when compared with the single life. Marriages link families in Ethiopia since the dowry paid by the family of the bride is often significant financially. According to one source, there are four ways that marriage can happen in Ethiopia: (1) arranged marriage, when well-respected elders are sent to the girl's family on behalf of the boy's family; (2) courtship or dating after a friendly meeting between boy and girl such as at a market place or holiday where there's dancing; (3) abduction, such as during a blood feud between families; (4) inheritance.
Asia.
Asia is a mix of traditional approaches with involvement by parents and extended families such as arranged marriages as well as modern dating. In many cultural traditions, including some in South Asia, and the Middle East and to some extent East Asia, as in the case of Omiai in Japan and the similar "Xiangqin" (相親) practiced in the Greater China Area, a date may be arranged by a third party, who may be a family member, acquaintance, or professional matchmaker.
China.
Patterns of dating are changing in China, with increased modernization bumping into traditional ways.
One report in "China Daily" suggests that dating for Chinese university women is "difficult" and "takes work" and steals time away from academic advancement, and places women in a precarious position of having to balance personal success against traditional Chinese relationships. Women have high standards for men they seek, but also worry that their academic credentials may "scare away more traditional Chinese men." It is difficult finding places to have privacy, since many dormitory rooms have eight or more pupils in one suite. And dating in restaurants can be expensive. One commentator noted: "American couples drink and dance together. But in China, we study together." Professional single women can choose to wait:
The game show "If You Are the One", titled after Chinese personal ads, featured provocative contestants making sexual allusions and the show reportedly ran afoul of authorities and had to change its approach. The two-host format involves a panel of 24 single women questioning a man to decide if he'll remain on the show; if he survives, he can choose a girl to date; the show gained notoriety for controversial remarks and opinions such as model Ma Nuo saying she'd prefer to "weep in a BMW than laugh on a bike", who was later banned from making appearances.
A new format of Internet "QQ" chat rooms is gaining ground against so-called "traditional dating agencies" in Changsha (Hunan Province); the QQ rooms have 20,000 members, and service is much less expensive than dating agencies which can charge 100 to 200 yuan ($13 to $26 USD) per introduction. Internet dating, with computer-assisted matchmaking, is becoming more prevalent; one site supposedly has 23 million registered users. Speed dating has come to Shanghai and other cities. Worldwide online matchmakers have explored entering the Chinese market via partnerships or acquisitions.
There are conflicting reports about dating in China's capital city. One account suggests that the dating scene in Beijing is "sad" with particular difficulties for expatriate Chinese women hoping to find romance. One explanation was that there are more native Chinese women, who seem to be preferred by Chinese men, and that expat women are seen as "foreigners" by comparison. According to the 2006 report, expat Chinese men have better luck in the Beijing dating scene. A different report, however, suggested that Chinese men preferred Western women who they consider to be more independent, less girlish, and more straightforward than Chinese women. Another account suggested that western women in Beijing seem "invisible" and have trouble attracting Chinese men.
Each year November 11 has become an unofficial holiday known as China's Singles' Day when singles are encouraged to make an extra effort to find a partner. Worried parents of unmarried children often arrange dates for their offspring on this day as well as others. Before the day approaches, thousands of college students and young workers post messages describing their plans for this day. Why November 11? In Arabic numerals, the day looks like "1111", that is, "like four single people standing together," and there was speculation that it originated in the late 1990s when college students celebrated being single with "a little self-mockery" but a differing explanation dates it back to events in the Roman Empire. For many, Singles' Day offers people a way to "demonstrate their stance on love and marriage.
There is concern that young people's views of marriage have changed because of economic opportunities, with many choosing deliberately not to get married, as well as young marrieds who have decided not to have children, or to postpone having them. Cohabiting relationships are tolerated more often. Communities where people live but don't know each other well are becoming more common in China like elsewhere, leading to fewer opportunities to meet somebody locally without assistance. Divorce rates are rising in cities such as Shanghai which recorded 27,376 divorces in 2004, an increase of 30% from 2003.
A government-sponsored agency called Shanghai Women's Activities Centre (Chinese: Jinguoyuan) organized periodic matchmaking events often attended by parents.
Chinese-style flirtatiousness is termed "sajiao", best described as "to unleash coquettishness" with feminine voice, tender gestures, and girlish protestations. Chinese women expect to be taken care of ("zhaogu") by men like a baby girl is doted on by an attentive and admiring father. They wish to be almost "spoiled" ("guan") by a man buying gifts, entertainment, and other indulgences. It's a positive sign of "heartache" ("xinteng") when a man feels compelled to do "small caring things" for a woman without being asked such as pouring a glass of water or offering a "piggyback ride if she's tired." These are signs of love and accepted romantic notions in China, according to one source.
Romantic love is more difficult during times of financial stress, and economic forces can encourage singles, particularly women, to select a partner primarily on financial considerations. Some men postpone marriage until their financial position is more secure and use wealth to help attract women. One trend is towards exclusive matchmaking events for the 'rich and powerful'; for example, an annual June event in Wuhan with expensive entry-ticket prices for men (99,999 RMB) lets financially secure men choose so-called "bikini brides" based on their beauty and education, and the financial exclusivity of the event was criticized by the official news outlet "China Daily".
There was a report that sexual relations among middle schoolers in Guangzhou sometimes resulted in abortions which, according to a report in "China Daily", resulted in greater statistical chances of subsequent sterility. There have been reports of scams involving get-rich-quick schemes; a forty-year-old migrant worker was one of a thousand seduced by an advertisement which read "Rich woman willing to pay 3 million yuan for sperm donor" but the worker was cheated out of his savings of 190,000 yuan (27,500 USD).
India.
Indian dating is heavily influenced by the custom of arranged marriages which require little dating, although there are indications that the institution is undergoing change, and that "love marriages" are becoming more accepted as India becomes more intertwined with the rest of the world.
The majority of Indian marriages are arranged by parents and relatives, and one estimate is that 9 of every 10 marriages are arranged. Sometimes the bride and groom don't meet until the wedding, and there is no courtship or wooing before the joining. In the past, it meant that couples were chosen from the same caste and religion and economic status. There is widespread support for arranged marriages generally. Writer Lavina Melwani described a happy marriage which had been arranged by the bride's father, and noted that during the engagement, the woman was allowed to go out with him before they were married on only one occasion; the couple married and found happiness. Supporters of arranged marriage suggest that there is a risk of having the marriage fall apart whether it was arranged by relatives or by the couple themselves, and that what's important is not how the marriage came to be but what the couple does after being married. Parents and relatives exert considerable influence, sometimes posting matrimonial ads in newspapers and online. Customs encourage families to put people together, and discourage sexual experimentation as well as so-called "serial courtship" in which a prospective bride or groom dates but continually rejects possible partners, since the interests of the family are seen as more important than the romantic needs of the people marrying. Indian writers, such as Mistry in his book "Family Matters", sometimes depict arranged marriages as unhappy. Writer Sarita Sarvate of "India Currents" thinks people calculate their "value" on the "Indian marriage market" according to measures such as family status, and that arranged marriages typically united spouses who often didn't love each other. She suggested "love" was out of place in this world because it risked passion and "sordid" sexual liaisons. Love, as she sees it, is "Waking up in the morning and thinking about someone." Writer Jennifer Marshall described the wife in an arranged marriage as living in a world of solitude without much happiness, and feeling pressured by relatives to conceive a son so she wouldn't be considered as "barren" by her husband's family; in this sense, the arranged marriage didn't bring "love, happiness, and companionship." Writer Vijaysree Venkatraman believes arranged marriages are unlikely to disappear soon, commenting in his book review of Shoba Narayan's "Monsoon Diary" which has a detailed description of the steps involved in a present day arranged marriage. There are indications that even the institution of arranged marriages is changing, with marriages increasingly being arranged by "unknown, unfamiliar sources" and less based on local families who know each other. Writer Lavina Melwani in "Little India" compared Indian marriages to business deals:
Relationships in which dating is undertaken by two people, who choose their dates without parental involvement and sometimes carry on clandestine get-togethers, has become increasingly common. When this leads to a wedding, the resulting unions are sometimes called "love marriages". There are increasing incidences when couples initiate contact on their own, particularly if they live in a foreign country; in one case, a couple met surreptitiously over a game of cards. Indians who move abroad to Britain or America often follow the cultural patterns of their new country: for example, one Indian woman met a white American man while skiing, and married him, and the formerly "all-important relatives" were reduced to bystanders trying to influence things ineffectively. Factors operating worldwide, such as increased affluence, the need for longer education, and greater mobility have lessened the appeal for arranged marriages, and these trends have affected criteria about which possible partners are acceptable, making it more likely that pairings will cross previously impenetrable barriers such as caste or ethnic background. Indian-Americans in the U.S. sometimes participate in "Singles Meets" organized by websites which happen about once a month, with 100 participants at each event; an organizer did not have firm statistics about the success rate leading to a long-term relationship but estimated about one in every ten members finds a partner through the site.
Dating websites are gaining ground in India. Writer Rupa Dev preferred websites which emphasized authenticity and screened people before entering their names into their databases, making it a safer environment overall, so that site users can have greater trust that it is safe to date others on the site. Dev suggested that dating websites were much better than the anonymous chatrooms of the 1990s.
During the interval before marriage, whether it is an arranged or a love marriage, private detectives have been hired to check up on a prospective bride or groom, or to verify claims about a potential spouse made in newspaper advertising, and there are reports that such snooping is increasing. Detectives investigate former amorous relationships and can include fellow college students, former police officers skilled in investigations, and medical workers "with access to health records."
Transsexuals and eunuchs have begun using Internet dating in some states in India.
The practice of dating runs against some religious traditions, and the radical Hindu group Sri Ram Sena threatened to "force unwed couples" to marry, if they were discovered dating on Valentine's Day; a fundamentalist leader said "drinking and dancing in bars and celebrating this day has nothing to do with Hindu traditions." The threat sparked a protest via the Internet which resulted in cartloads of pink panties being sent to the fundamentalist leader's office.
Japan.
There is a type of courtship called "Omiai" in which parents hire a matchmaker to give resumes and pictures to potential mates for their approval, leading to a formal meeting with parents and matchmaker attending. If the couple has a few dates, they're often pressured by the matchmaker and parents to decide whether or not to marry. There are reports of men falling in "love" with digital simulations of women from video games, manga, and anime; one 27-year-old man known by the handle of "Sal 9000" staged a wedding in 2009, watched by thousands online, in which he married his waifu named "Nene Anegasaki".
Korea.
The Reasons for dating in Korea are various. Research conducted by Saegye Daily showed that teenagers choose to date for reasons such as “to become more mature,” “to gain consultation on worries, or troubles,” or “to learn the difference between boys and girls,” etc. Similarly, a news report in MK Daily showed that the primary reasons for dating for workers of age 20 ~ 30 are “emotional stability,” “marriage,” “someone to spend time with,” and etc. An interesting feature in the reasons for dating in Korea is that many Koreans are somewhat motivated to find a date due to the societal pressure that often views single persons as incompetent.
Present Korean dating shows a changing attitude due to the influence of tradition and modernization. There are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life as traditional values. Patriarchy in Korea has been grounded on Confucian culture that postulated hierarchical social orders according to age and sex. Patriarchy and Women Patriarchy is "a system of social structure and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women” which is well reflected in the ways of dating in Korea. Adding to it, there is an old saying that says a boy and a girl should not sit together after they have reached the age of seven. It is one of the old teachings of Confucianism and reveals its inclination toward conservatism.
Most Koreans tend to regard dating as a precursor to marriage. According to a survey conducted by Gyeonggi-do Family Women’s Researcher on people of age 26-44, 85.7% of respondents replied as ‘willing to get married’. There is no dating agency but the market for marriage agencies are growing continuously. DUO and Gayeon are one of the major marriage agencies in Korea. Also, “Mat-sun,” the blind date which is usually based on the premise of marriage, is held often among ages of late 20s to 30s. But the late trend is leaning towards the separation between dating and marriage unlike the conservative ways of the past. In the survey conducted by a marriage agency, of 300 single males and females who were asked of their opinions on marring their lovers, about only 42% of the males and 39% of the females said yes. There are also cases of dating without the premise of marriage. However, the majority still takes getting into a relationship seriously.
Dating in Korea is also considered a necessary activity supported by society. Korean adults are constantly questioned whether or not they are dating by the people around them. During family gatherings on holidays one of the questions that people hate getting asked the most is related to marriage. According to a survey it was the highest ranked by 47.3 percent according to working singles.
College students in their sophomore to junior year who have not been in a relationship feel anxious that they are falling behind amongst their peers. Most of them try “sogaeting”, going out on a blind date, for the first time to get into a relationship. Dating is a duty that most people feel they must take on to not seem incompetent. 
In recent trends, even dramas such as “”Shining Romance” (“빛나는 로맨스”), and “Jang Bo-ri is Here!” (“왔다 장보리”), and in a variety show called, “Dad! Where Are We Going!” (“아빠 어디가?”) there are elementary children confessing their love.
Dating has also been depicted to be an activity of fun and happiness. There are Korean TV programs that film celebrities together as married couples supporting this depiction of dating such as “We Got Married” (“우리 결혼했어요”), “With You” (“님과 함께”) and “The Man Who Gets Married Daily” (“매일 결혼 하는 남자.”)
According to a survey by wedding consulting agency, men consider a physical relation as a catalyst of love, otherwise, women regard it as a confirmation of affection. Adding to it, both 79.2% of men and 71.0% of women stated that how deep their physical relation in dating is concerned in the decision of whether to marry.
Pakistan.
Marriages and courtship in Pakistan are influenced by traditional cultural practices similar to those elsewhere in the Indian subcontinent as well as Muslim norms and manners. Illegitimate relationships before marriage are considered a social taboo and social interaction between unmarried men and women is encouraged at a modest and healthy level. Couples are usually wedded through either an arranged marriage or love marriage. Love marriages are those in which the individuals have chosen a partner whom they like by their own choice prior to marriage, and usually occur with the consent of parents and family. Arranged marriages on the other hand are marriages which are set and agreed by the families or guardians of the two individuals where the couple may not have met before. In either cases and in consistency with traditional marital practices, individuals who marry are persuaded to meet and talk to each other for some time before considering marrying so that they can check their compatibility.
Singapore.
Singapore's largest dating service, SDU, Social Development Unit, is a government-run dating system. The original SDU, which controversially promoted marriages among university graduate singles, no longer exists today. On 28 January 2009, it was merged with SDS Development Services, which just as controversially promoted marriages among non-graduate singles. The merged unit, SDN Social Development Network seeks to promote meaningful relationships, with marriage touted as a top life goal, among all resident singles within a conducive network environment of singles, relevant commercial and public entities.
Taiwan.
One report suggested that in southern Taiwan, "traditional rules of courtship" still apply despite the influence of popular culture; for example, men continue to take the initiative in forming relationships. A poll in 2009 of students at high schools and vocational schools found that over 90% admitted that they had "no clear idea of how to approach someone of the opposite sex who interested them". What caused relationships to break up? 60% said "changes of heart" or "cheating". Dating more than one person at a time was not permissible, agreed 70%.
Europe.
Britain.
In Britain, the term "dating" bears similarity to the American sense of the tentative exploratory part of a relationship. If two people are "going out together", it may mean they're dating but that their relationship has advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend relationship although they're not cohabitating. Although Britons are familiar with the term "dating," the rituals surrounding courtship are somewhat different from those commonly found in North America. Writer Kira Cochrane advises daters to "get out there and meet people" while noting a trend of temporary suspension of marriage until an individual reaches his or her thirties. She sees a trend for developing new ways of meeting people. In contrast, writer Bibi van der Zee found dating etiquette rules to be helpful, and found that supposedly liberated advice such as "just be yourself" to be the "most useless advice in history." She expresses frustration following fruitless sexual relationships, and that her mid twenties saw dating relationships with partners who were less willing to return phone calls or display interest in long-term commitment. She felt "clueless and unwanted", she wrote, and found advice books such as "The Rules" helpful. British writer Henry Castiglione signed up for a "weekend flirting course" and found the experience helpful; he was advised to talk to and smile at everyone he met. Emailing back-and-forth, after meeting on a dating website, is one way to get to know people in Britain, and elsewhere. In the U.K., one estimate is that 15 million people are single, and half of these are seeking a long-term relationship; three-quarters of them have not been in a relationship for more than 18 months. In a twelve-month period, the average number of dates that a single person will have is four. When dating, 43% of people google their dates ahead of time. Almost five million Britons visited a dating website in the past twelve months. A third admitting to lying on their profile. A fifth of married individuals between 19 and 25 met their spouse online, according to one estimate. One poll in 2009 of 3,000 couples suggested that the average duration of their courtship period, between first meeting to the acceptance of a marriage proposal, was three years.
France.
A speed dating event at a hotel in Cerizay was "open to anyone aged 20 and above and starts at 20.00 with a light buffet and apéritif, price €15," and required reservations. One Internet dating site will "allow people to share their single friends in the same way they share files."
German-speaking countries.
While analysts such as Harald Martenstein and others suggest that it is easier for persons to initiate contact in America, many Germans view the American dating habits as "unspontaneous", "ridiculous" and "rigid". Until the 1960's, countries such as Germany, Switzerland and Austria had a more formal approach for first contacts that was eased during seasonal festivals like carnival and festivals and funfairs like the Oktoberfest, which allowed for more casual flirts.
Membership in voluntary associations is relatively high in German-speaking countries and these provided further chances for possible partners to meet. Strolling on Esplanadess and Promenade walkways such as the one in Hamburg called the Jungfernstieg (maidens way), have been another venue for introductions as early as the 19th century. Analyst Geoffrey Gorer described dating as an American idiosyncrasy focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as American proms. In contrast German speaking countries and the longstanding musical tradition there provided ample opportunity of persons of varying ages enjoying social dances, such as the Vienna Opera Ball and other occasions.
Romantic encounters were often described with French terms like rendezvous or tête-à-tête. The German term of "Stelldichein" (as translated by Joachim Heinrich Campes) is used to signify dating when the age of consent to marriage was relatively high. German traditions to signify lovers who met in hiding were described with terms like "Fensterln" (windowing) or "Kiltgang" (dawn stroll) used in Bavaria and Switzerland. Analyst Sebastian Heinzel sees a major cultural divide between American dating habits and European informality, and leads to instances in which European expatriates in cities such as New York keep to themselves.
Today, most German couples in long-term relationships get to know each other through mutual friends, at work or while going out at night; the first few months of dating often involve sexual intercourse, but are still rather casual and do not imply a serious wish to get married.
Spain.
One report suggested Spanish women were the "greatest flirts", based on an unofficial study by a dating website which ranked countries based on initiations of contact.
Middle East.
Egypt.
In Egypt, like in many parts of the Middle East, sex without marriage is considered unacceptable. Dating in Egypt is predominantly done under family supervision, usually in a public area.
Iran.
People of different sexes are not allowed to "mix freely" in public. Since 1979, the state has become a religious autocracy, and imposes Islamic edicts on matters such as dating. Clerics run officially sanctioned internet dating agencies with strict rules. Prospective couples can have three meetings: two with strict supervision inside the center, and the third being a "brief encounter on their own"; afterwards, they can either (1) choose to marry or (2) agree to never see each other again. This has become the subject of a film by Iranian filmmaker Leila Lak. Iran has a large population of young people with sixty percent of the 70-million population being under the age of thirty. However, economic hardship discourages marriage, and divorce rates have increased in Tehran to around a quarter of marriages, even though divorce is taboo. While the Iranian government "condemns dating and relationships", it promotes marriage with (1) online courses (2) "courtship classes" where students can "earn a diploma" after sitting through weekly tests and "hundreds of hours of education" (3) "marriage diplomas" (4) matchmaking and arranged marriages. Authorities push a conservative approach and shun unmarried romantic relationships and encourage "traditional match-making". But young people have disobeyed the restrictions; one said "It is wiser to have different relationships" and believed in defying religious rules which suggest "short-term illegitimate relationships harm dignity." Adultery can be punished by death. While youths can flout selected restrictions, there are almost no instances in which unmarried people move in together. There have been efforts to promote "Sigheh" (temporary marriage).
Lebanon.
One report suggests the "Lebanese dating game" is hampered by "the weight of family demands upon individual choice" and that there were difficulties, particularly for people seeking to marry across religious lines, such as a Christian seeking to marry a Muslim.
Saudi Arabia.
The "Saudi Gazette" quoted a Wikipedia article on domestic violence, suggesting it was an issue for Saudis, including abusive behavior while dating by one or both partners.
North America.
Canada and United States.
One report suggested the United States as well as other western-oriented countries were different from the rest of the world because "love is the reason for mating," as opposed to marriages being arranged to cement economic and class ties between families and promote political stability. Dating, by mutual consent of two single people, is the norm. British writer Kira Cochrane, after moving to the U.S., found herself grappling with the American approach to dating. She wondered why it was acceptable to juggle "10 potential partners" while weighing different attributes; she found American-style dating to be "exhausting and strange." She found dating in America to be "organized in a fairly formal fashion" with men approaching women and asking point blank for a date; she found this to be "awkward." She described the "third date rule" which was that women weren't supposed to have sex until the third date even if they desired it, although men were supposed to try for sex. She wrote: "Dating rules almost always cast the man as aggressor, and the woman as prey, which frankly makes me feel nauseous." Canadian writer Danielle Crittenden, however, chronicling female angst, criticized a tendency not to take dating seriously and suggested that postponing marriage into one's thirties was problematic:
There is evidence that couples differ in the pace and timing with which they initiate sex in their relationships. Studies show that approximately 50% of premarital young adult couples become sexually involved within the first month of dating, while 25% initiate sex one to three months after beginning to date and a small proportion of couples wait until marriage before initiating sexual relations.
Teenagers and college-aged students tend to avoid the more formal activity of dating, and prefer casual no-strings-attached experiments sometimes described as "hookups". It permits young women to "go out and fit into the social scene, get attention from young men, and learn about sexuality", according to one report by sociologists. The term "hookup" can describe a wide variety of behavior ranging from kissing to non-genital touching to make-out sessions; according to one report, only about one third of people had sexual intercourse. A contrary report, however, suggested there has been no "sea change" in sexual behavior regarding college students from 1988 onwards, and that the term "hookup" itself continued to be used to describe a variety of relationships, including merely socializing or passionate kissing as well as sexual intercourse.
Muslims living in the United States can choose whether to use traditional Islamic methods, or date American-style; Muslims choosing to stick to Islamic tradition can "only marry another Muslim", according to one Malaysian account. Mosques have been known to try to bring people together––one in California has a dating service for Muslims.
Oceania.
Australia.
There are reports that guys are asking out girls for dates by text messaging. A recent study revealed that 50% of Australians agreed it was permissible to request a date via a text message but not acceptable to break up with them this way. Flirting while texting, dubbed "flirtext", was more likely to be done by girls after a relationship was started. A survey of newspaper readers suggested it was time to abandon the "old fashioned rule" of men paying for the first date, based on women's greater earning capacity. A dating show on TV features three couples who live under one roof, but who can only have contact in a "specially created dark room", and the show is scheduled to be hosted by Miss Australia model Laura Dundovic.
South America.
Brazil.
In Brazil, according to one report, there's a longer time interval before children move out of the house, which affects dating. As a result, parents offer advice about dating although it may not be heeded. Men interested in Brazilian women are advised to befriend them first. Even though Brazilians can be viewed as warm people, they are less likely to "share intimacies" until they are well into the relationship. Different from North America, there is no "multi-dating" in Brazil: that is, when in a relationship, it is assumed that both parties are exclusive to each other.
Impact of sexual orientation.
A report in "Psychology Today" found that homosexual men were attracted to men in their late teens and early twenties and didn't care much about the status of a prospective partner; rather, physical attractiveness was the key. Gay men, on average, tend to have more sexual partners, while lesbians tended to form steadier one-on-one relationships, and tend to be less promiscuous than heterosexual women. One gay man found dating online difficult, and found that there is an element of deception on dating website profiles just like everywhere else:
The deception got worse. When he met his date who he had befriended online who he dubbed "Facebook Guy" for the first time, he wrote:
In India, transsexuals and eunuchs have used Internet dating to help them find partners, but there continue to be strong societal pressures which marginalize these groups.
Matchmakers.
People can meet other people on their own or the get-together can be arranged by someone else. Matchmaking is an art based entirely on hunches, since it is impossible to predict with certainty whether two people will like each other or not. "All you should ever try and do is make two people be in the same room at the same time," advised matchmaker Sarah Beeny in 2009, and the only rule is to make sure the people involved want to be set up. One matchmaker advised it was good to match "brains as well as beauty" and try to find people with similar religious and political viewpoints and thinks that like-minded people result in more matches, although acknowledging that opposites sometimes attract. It is easier to put several people together at the same time, so there are other candidates possible if one doesn't work out, according to Hannah Pool. And, after introducing people, don't meddle.
Friends as matchmakers.
Friends remain an excellent way for people to meet people, according to sociologist Edward Laumann of the University of Chicago, who wrote that "A real person––whatever his relationship to you, be it friend or kinsman or co-worker––is still far and away the most reliable kind of way to meet someone." However, the Internet promises to overtake friends in the future, if present trends continue, according to an article in "USA Today". A friend can introduce two people who don't know each other, and the friend may play matchmaker and send them on a blind date. In "The Guardian", British writer Hannah Pool was cynical about being set up on a blind date; she was told "basically he's you but in a male form" by the mutual friend. She googled her blind date's name along with the words "wife" and "girlfriend" and "partner" and "boyfriend" to see whether her prospective date was in any kind of relationship or gay; he wasn't any of these things. She met him for coffee in London and she now lives with him, sharing a home and business. When friends introduce two people who do not know each other, it is often called a blind date.
Family as matchmakers.
Parents, via their contacts with associates or neighbors or friends, can introduce their children to each other. In India, parents often place matrimonial ads in newspapers or online, and may post the resumes of the prospective bride or groom.
Matchmaking systems and services.
Dating systems can be systematic and organized ways to improve matchmaking by using rules or technology. The meeting can be in-person or "live" as well as separated by time or space such as by telephone or email or chat-based. The purpose of the meeting is for the two persons to decide whether to go on a date in the future.
Computers as matchmakers.
Computer dating systems of later 20th century, especially popular in the 1960s and 1970s, before the rise of sophisticated phone and computer systems, gave customers forms that they filled out with important tolerances and preferences, which were "matched by computer" to determine "compatibility" of the two customers. The history of dating systems is closely tied to the history of technologies that support them, although a statistics-based dating service that used data from forms filled out by customers opened in Newark, New Jersey in 1941. The first large-scale computer dating system, The Scientific Marriage Foundation, was established in 1957 by Dr. George W. Crane. In this system, forms that applicants filled out were processed by an early IBM card sorting machine. In the early 1980s in New York City, software developer Gary Robinson developed a now–defunct dating service called "212-Romance" which used computer algorithms to match singles romantically, using a voice–mail based interface backed by community-based automated recommendations enhanced by "collaborative filtering" technologies. Compatibility algorithms and matching software are becoming increasingly sophisticated, according to one report.
Online dating services are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. They charge a fee to enable a user to post a profile of himself or herself, perhaps using video or still images as well as descriptive data and personal preferences for dating, such as age range, hobbies, and so forth. One report suggests that online dating businesses are thriving financially, with growth in members, service offerings, membership fees and with many users renewing their accounts, although the overall share of Internet traffic using online dating services in the U.S. has declined somewhat, from 2003 (21% of all Internet users) to 2006 (10%), and that dating sites must work to convince users that they're safe places having quality members, according to Jupiter Research. While online dating has become more accepted, it retains a slight negative stigma, according to one writer. There is widespread evidence that online dating has increased rapidly and is becoming "mainstream" with new websites appearing regularly. One study suggested that 18% of single persons had used the Internet for dating purposes. Reports vary about the effectiveness of dating web sites to result in marriages or long–term relationships. Pew Research, based on a 2005 survey of 3,215 adults, estimated that three million Americans had entered into long-term relationships or marriage as a result of meeting on a dating web site. While sites have touted marriage rates from 10% to 25%, sociologists and marriage researchers are highly skeptical that valid statistics underlie any such claims. The Pew study (see table) suggested the Internet was becoming increasingly prominent and accepted as a way to meet people for dates, although there were cautions about deception, the risk of violence, and some concerns about stigmas. The report suggested most people had positive experiences with online dating websites and felt they were excellent ways to meet more people. The report also said that online daters tend to have more liberal social attitudes compared to the general population. In India, parents sometimes participate in websites designed to match couples. Some online dating sites can organize double dates or group dates. Research from Berkeley suggests there's a dropoff in interest after online daters meet face–to–face. It's a "lean medium" not offering standard cues such as tone of voice, gestures, and facial expressions. There is substantial data about online dating habits; for example, researchers believe that "the likelihood of a reply to a message sent by one online dater to another drops roughly 0.7 percent with every day that goes by". Psychologist Lindsay Shaw Taylor found that even though people said they'd be willing to date someone of a different race, that people tend to choose dates similar to themselves.
Internet "QQ" chat rooms. This type of dating approach, cheaper than traditional websites and agencies, is gaining ground in China.
Media.
In board games.
"Mystery Date" is a board game from the Milton Bradley Company, originally released in 1965 and reissued in 1970, 1999, and in 2005, whose object is to be ready for a date by acquiring three matching color-coded cards to assemble an outfit. The outfit must then match the outfit of the date at the "mystery door". If the player's outfit does not match the date behind the door, the door is closed and play continues. The game has been mentioned, featured, or parodied in several popular films and television shows.
In television.
Numerous television reality and game shows, past and current, address dating. For example, the dating game shows "The Dating Game" first aired in 1965, while more modern shows in that genre include "The Manhattan Dating Project" (US Movie about Dating in New York City), "Blind Date", "The 5th Wheel", and "The Bachelor" and its spinoff series, in which a high degree of support and aids are provided to individuals seeking dates. These are described more fully in an article on them alone and in the related article on "reality game shows" that often include or motivate romantic episodes between players. Another category of dating-oriented reality TV shows involves matchmaking, such as "Millionaire Matchmaker" and "Tough Love".
Age groups.
Dating can happen for people in most age groups with the possible exception of children. Teenagers and tweens have been described as dating; according to one report by the CDC, three-quarters of eighth and ninth graders in the United States described themselves as "dating", although it is unclear what is exactly meant by this term.
Young persons are exposed to many in their high schools or secondary schools or college or universities. There is anecdotal evidence that traditional dating—one-on-one public outings—has declined rapidly among the younger generation in the United States in favor of less intimate sexual encounters sometimes known as "hookups" (slang), described as brief sexual experiences with "no strings attached", although exactly what is meant by the term "hookup" varies considerably. Dating is being bypassed and is seen as archaic, and relationships are sometimes seen as "greedy" by taking time away from other activities, although exclusive relationships form later. Some college newspapers have decried the lack of dating on campuses after a 2001 study was published, and conservative groups have promoted "traditional" dating. When young people are in school, they have a lot of access to people their own age, and don't need tools such as online websites or dating services. Chinese writer Lao Wai, writing to homeland Chinese about America, considered that the college years were the "golden age of dating" for Americans, when Americans dated more than at any other time in their life. "Once they are way past school, it's harder to find a partner," according to dating coach Evan Marc Katz, who urges singles to go online. There are indications people in their twenties are less focused on marriage but on careers; according to "National Public Radio", "marriage is often the last thing on the minds of young people leaving college today."
People over thirty, lacking the recency of a college experience, have better luck online finding partners. Economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett in 2002 found that 55% of 35-year-old career women were childless, while 19% of male corporate executives were, and concluded that "the rule of thumb seems to be that the more successful the woman, the less likely it is she will find a husband or bear a child."
While people tend to date others close to their own age, it's possible for older men to date younger women. In many countries, the older-man-younger-woman arrangement is seen as permissible, sometimes with benefits. It's looked on more positively in the U.S. than in China; older men are described as more knowledgeable sexually and intellectually, supportive, skilled in the ways of women, and financially more secure so there's "no more going Dutch." In China, older men with younger women are more likely to be described as "weird uncles" rather than "silver foxes." One Beijing professor reportedly advised his male students to delay dating:
A notable example of the older-woman-younger-man is Demi Moore pairing with 15-years her junior Ashton Kutcher. Older women in such relations have recently been described as "cougars", and formerly such relationships were often kept secret or discreet, but there is a report that such relationships are becoming more accepted and increasing.
Since divorce is increasing in many areas, sometimes celebrated with "divorce parties", there is dating advice for the freshly divorced as well, which includes not talking about your ex or your divorce, but focusing on "activities that bring joy to your life." Adviser Claire Rayner in "The Guardian" suggests calling people from your address book with whom you haven't been in touch for years and say "I'd love to get back in contact." Do activities you like doing with like-minded people; if someone seems interesting to you, tell them. It's more acceptable for this group for women to ask men out.

Pillar Box War

The Pillar Box War refers to a number of politically motivated acts of vandalism against post boxes in Scotland during the early 1950s in a dispute over the correct title of the new British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II.
Background.
Ascending to the throne in February 1952 following the death of her father, George VI, the former Princess Elizabeth adopted the Royal style of Elizabeth the Second of the United Kingdom. This was reflected in the Queen's Royal Cypher, which took the Latin form 'EIIR'.
Some objected to this usage as the new Queen was in fact only the first Elizabeth to reign over the United Kingdom or indeed Great Britain, Elizabeth I having been solely the Queen of England. In 1953, John MacCormick took legal action against the Lord Advocate in the case of MacCormick v. Lord Advocate challenging the right of the Queen to call herself Elizabeth the Second. The case failed on the grounds that the matter was within the Royal Prerogative and thus the Queen was free to adopt any title she saw fit, however a submission by the Crown stated that the Royal title was decided to reflect the highest number from either the Kingdom of England or the Kingdom of Scotland and whilst Elizabeth II was not the second Elizabeth of the United Kingdom, she was the second Elizabeth in the territory which now made up the United Kingdom.
Actions and legacy.
Some occasions of vandalism and even explosions of post boxes which carried the Queen's EIIR insignia were recorded. One particular pillar box in Edinburgh's Inch district was repeatedly vandalised with tar, paint and a hammer before being blown to pieces less than three months after its unveiling 
The folksongs "Sky High Joe" and "The Ballad of the Inch" [http://www.scotsindependent.org/songbook/balladof_theinch.htm commemorate these events.
After 1953, new post boxes were placed in Scotland carrying only the Crown of Scotland image rather than the EIIR cypher, which continued to be used in the rest of the United Kingdom, and indeed in some of the Queen's other realms and territories.

Carl E. Walsh

Carl Eugene Walsh is an American economist. He has been an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz since 1987, and Distinguished Professor of Economics and chair of the Economics Department at the university since 2010. He has also served in several positions in the Federal Reserve System. 
Walsh's work is primarily in the fields of central banking and monetary policy.
Early life and education.
Walsh received his B.A. in mathematics and economics in 1971 and his Ph.D. in economics in 1976, both from the University of California, Berkeley.
Career.
Walsh was a lecturer at the University of Auckland in New Zealand from 1976 to 1978 and assistant professor at Princeton University from 1979 to 1985. Walsh was senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco from 1985 to 1987. Walsh moved to the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1987, becoming associate professor. Walsh was named full professor in 1991 and was named distinguished professor in 2010.
Walsh has held visiting appointments at several institutions, including UC Berkeley economics department (visiting lecturer, 1979; visiting assistant professor, 1985), the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (visiting scholar, 1982-1983), the International Finance Division of the Federal Reserve Board (visiting scholar, July 1984), the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (visiting senior economist, 1984-1985), the UC Berkeley School of Business (visiting lecturer, 1986-1987), the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (visiting scholar, 1987-present), and Stanford University (visiting professor, fall 1995). Walsh was vice provost of the UC Santa Cruz's Silicon Valley Initiatives from 2005 to 2007. He is a co-editor of the "International Journal of Central Banking".
Walsh is an international research fellow at Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
Work.
Walsh has become best known for his paper "Optimal Contracts for Central Bankers," published in 1995 in the "American Economic Review". His theory is commonly referred to as the "Walsh Contract."

Bang Camaro

Bang Camaro is an American hard rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. Founded by guitarists Bryn Bennett and Alex Necochea in 2005, it is composed of members of various indie rock bands from the area. In 2009, the group is signed with Black Sword Records, 8th Impression Music, and Fontana/Universal.
History.
"Break-up" (2009) and "reunion" (2010).
It was widely believed that Bang Camaro broke up after performing at Game Unicon 2009 in Marlboro, MA, or after their performances at Rocklahoma 2009 in Norman, OK, and had their final performance in December 2009 in Boston, MA. Founder and rhythm guitarist Alex Necochea addressed their broken-up status as ultimately incorrect on the band's official blog in the weeks leading up to their fall 2010 show in Boston, MA.
Musical style and influences.
The band is composed of a bassist, a drummer, 2 guitarists, and a lead singer complement which comprises anywhere from eight to twelve vocalists. Their style is similar to late '70s–80s glam and anthem rock music. The basic song structure highlights catchy choruses and integrates frequent guitar solos.
The band cite Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly, plus metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Skid Row, Def Leppard, and Dokken, as influences. Discussing their anthem rock style, band member Alex Necochea said, "We're really not heavy metal. I think our focus is more on writing great singles, as best as we can make them. That's just something Bryn and I grew up on. We're big fans of melody and big driving hooks, that sort of thing."

The Trust Company.
Founded in Japan in 1977, The Trust company LTD has become a major player in automotive performance products. With popular brand names like GReddy, GREX, and GRacer, the Trust Company offers one of the widest varieties of performance automotive components. They are most well known for their complete cat-back exhaust systems with unique straight-through muffler design and bolt-on turbocharger kits.
Since 1994, the development and distribution of Trust Company products in the United States has been accomplished by GReddy Performance Products, based in Irvine, California. Trust was unable to use its own name there as it was already copyrighted, therefore they became officially known as GReddy.
In August 2008 the TRUST Company in Japan consolidated their supply of GReddy products throughout Australia and New Zealand which has culminated in the establishment of GReddy Oceania based in Sydney Australia.
GReddy.
The division that makes exhaust systems, turbo kits, cooling systems, electronics and accessory lines for Japanese and American cars.
Greddy is pronounced "GRED-dy", . The name originated from two words "GREAT" and "Eddy," as in a strong swirling wind current, referring to the strong swirling intake air of a turbocharger.
The "GR" in uppercase and the "eddy" in lowercase to show where the two words were combined. It also works well for the GReddy trademarked logo.
Bankruptcy and Reorganization.
According to various reports, by 2008 TRUST was approximately $60 million in debt and, after reporting a serious decline in sales since February 2008 and amassing $43 million in loan payments, they filed for "Minji-saisei-hou" in Tokyo District Court on September 10, 2008, the Japanese equivalent of a Chapter 11 reorganization plan in the U.S. The U.S. division was unaffected by the bankruptcy.
It was not until March 2009 that TRUST Co. LTD successfully completed reorganization through Minji-saisei-hou.

Paul Cummings

Paul Richard Cummings (5 September 1953 – 17 September 2001) was a world-class middle and long distance runner who ran competitively from the 1,500 meters to the marathon, breaking several American records and one world record. His ability to have a middle distance runner's kick and also have the stamina to compete in distances up to the marathon place him as one of the most versatile American track and road racers in history.
Early life.
Paul Cummings was born in Tempe, Arizona but his family moved to Santa Maria, California when he was 11 years old. Cummings was the third of thirteen children and had ten sisters. Cummings did not always see running as his strength. He played basketball in junior high, and wanted to continue in high school, but failed to make the team. However, when he came in first in his Physical Education class in the mile run, a new opportunity opened up for him; he was asked to join the track team at Ernest Righetti High School, and by his senior year was running the mile in 4:10, the second best time in California, seventh best in the country. Cummings was recruited by several top universities and chose to attend Brigham Young University.
Brigham Young University (1971-1975).
Cummings was named All-American five years in a row while running on the Brigham Young University Track and Cross Country teams. However, after his Freshman year, he was diagnosed with an extra bone in his foot and in order to run again, would have to undergo surgery to remove the bone. Cummings recovered, and by his junior year became the NCAA champion in the mile run. Cummings was the first runner from the Intermountain West to break the Four-minute mile barrier. His personal best for the mile, 3:56.4, was run at his birthplace, Tempe, Arizona on March 16, 1974.
Cummings was a Latter-day Saint. He wanted to serve a two year LDS mission, but since LDS Missions are served voluntarily and missionaries serve without compensation, he was unable to raise the required funds. After meeting with LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball, Paul was encouraged to stay in school on an athletic scholarship, earn his degree, and continue to run and compete, sharing his beliefs with those he met through running. Paul did this well and shared his beliefs with many athletes and friends.
BYU Track Coach Clarence Robison said Cummings was "a great performer and has great courage. He's a tenacious, fierce competitor."
Middle distance track racing.
Cummings was invited to several of the most prestigious track and field meets during the 1970s. He competed against Steve Prefontaine, Frank Shorter, Tony Waldrop, Marty Liquori, Filbert Bayi, Wilson Waigwa, John Walker, Steve Scott, Eamonn Coghlan, Dick Buerkle, and several other top tier runners of the era, besting everyone on this list at least once. He ran in the Millrose Games Wanamaker Mile in 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977, winning the event in 1976 in a Millrose Games record time of 3:57.6. He won events at the Sunkist Invitational, the LA Times Indoor Games, the Jack in the Box Indoor Games, the Modesto Relays, and other events.
On April 25, 1976, Cummings won the Penn Relays 1500 Meter event at Franklin Field in Philadelphia in 3:38.9.
In 1976 he won the 3,000 meter event at Los Angeles's Sunkist Invitational Track Meet in 8:29.6, just five seconds off Steve Prefontaine's American Record set at the same meet the year before. In 1977 he won the Sunkist Invitational indoor mile in 3:57.2. Also in 1977, Cummings, representing the USA, won the mile at Canada's Tri-Country indoor track and field meet, competing against Canada and the Soviet Union.
In January 1978 at the Muhammad Ali Track and Field Invitational at the Long Beach Arena in California, Cummings broke the indoor American record for the 1500 meters by .4 with a time of 3:39.8.
A year later, in January 1979 at the same Muhammad Ali Track and Field Invitational at the Long Beach Arena in California, both John Walker and Cummings finished under the indoor world record for the 1500 meters by .4 and .2 seconds respectively. Walker set a world record with a time of 3:37.4. Cummings set an American Record with a time of 3:37.6.
Cummings ran at a time when there was very little financial support for athletes after college. When attending track meets, several athletes would share the same hotel room, sleeping on floors, and carpool together to save costs. He worked at a steel mill rebuilding open hearth furnaces to support his family and ran for the Tobias Striders, Beverly Hills Striders and Pacific Coast track clubs to maintain his amateur status.
1984 US Olympic Team.
Hoping to earn a spot on the 1980 US Olympic Team, working out over five hours per day, and working full-time six days a week at a steel mill, Cummings was one of many athletes disappointed by the U.S.'s boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Games. Due to work demands and disappointment at the 1980 boycott, Cummings came close to retiring altogether from running. When he was laid off from the mill in late 1980, he began running full-time.
In 1984, Cummings won the US Olympic Trials in the 10,000 Meter run in Los Angeles, CA and finally became a member of the US Olympic Team. He was able to compete in the 10,000 meter run at the Olympics held in Los Angeles, but did not make the finals. Cummings suffered from allergies that hindered his performance at the games.
Road racing, American and World records.
In 1981, Cummings shifted his focus from track to road racing. One of his first marathons was the St. George Marathon, which he won in 2:15.16, a course record that stands to this day.
Taking advantage of new rules that enabled runners to compete professionally, Cummings represented New Balance shoes beginning in 1982. 
On June 5, 1982, Cummings ran his PR in the 5,000 meters at the Prefontaine Classic track meet in Eugene, Oregon, running against some of the best American middle distance runners of the time, including Matt Centrowitz, Alberto Salazar and Doug Padilla. He ran towards the front for most of the race and ran 13:19.62, a Personal Record by 9 seconds, and just short of the American Record set by Matt Centrowitz in the same race. The following link shows the entire race on video in two parts. Part 1. Part 2.
Paul Cummings was very busy and successful running road races in 1983. He ran in the Boston Marathon with the lead pack for most of the race. The following link shows a picture of Paul running with Benji Durden and Greg Meyer (eventual race winner and last American Male to win) in the 1983 race. He set an American Record in the 15K by almost 28 seconds at the Cascade Run Off in Portland, Oregon on June 26, 1983. Cummings placed in the top 10 at Spokane Washington's Bloomsday 12K Run (8th in 1983 and 2nd in 1984). Paul also ran in the New York City Marathon in 1983. 
On September 25, 1983, Cummings set the World Record in the Half marathon at the Dayton River Corridor Classic in Dayton, Ohio, with a time of 1:01:32.
Cummings was included in Runner's World Magazine's list of the top 20 highest paid runners, ranked 15th worldwide, in 1984. That same year, Cummings began running for Converse shoes.
Paul's best marathon time came in winning the 1986 Houston Marathon in 2:11:31. His best finish at the Boston Marathon was 8th place overall in 1986. 
Cummings is the only runner to finish second in San Francisco's Bay to Breakers 12K road race (Guinness World Record largest road race) three years in a row (1984, 1985, and 1986).
On March 15, 1987, Cummings broke the American Record in the 20K, at New Bedford, Massachusetts, in a time of 59.13.
Cummings continued running into his 40's. He won the US Master's National Championship for the Marathon in 1993 at the Twin Cities Marathon. He was also awarded the USA Track and Field (USATF) Master's Age Division (Age 40+) Runner of the Year in 1993.
Contributions.
In the late 1980s, Cummings, along with fellow Utah world class runners Ed Eyestone and Paul Pilkington started a summer high school high altitude running camp in Park City, Utah which ran for 15 years and helped hundreds of high school runners from across the country reach their potential.
In 1990, Cummings created a running video entitled "Running Theory: From Mile to Marathon" that expounded on "Consistency Training" which is an adaptation to Arthur Lydiard's four step "Phase Training". The four components of consistency training include: upper body strength training, endurance training, 70% effort training, and anaerobic capacity training.
Cummings explored the outer reaches of human endurance in his road race and marathon training, approaching the legendary endurance strategies of Gerry Lindgren. He ran up to 240 miles in one week, training three times a day with runs of 13 miles in the morning, 14 in the afternoon, and another 13 in the evening for six days. He rested on Sundays.
Cummings was inducted into the Brigham Young University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1986. He was posthumously inducted into the Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 2003.
Death.
Cummings enjoyed fishing, especially with his best friend Jay Woods. While fishing together on September 17, 2001, their canoe capsized under high winds at Strawberry Reservoir, Utah. He drowned in the accident. Paul was married for 27 years to Debra Gaye Anhder. They were the parents of four children; Heidi, Scott, Holly and Kelly. He is interred at the Lehi City Cemetery, Lehi, Utah.

Musical career.
Before receiving his PhD, he founded the first folk-rock Jewish music group named "Rashi and the Rishonim" at the age of 17. He gave concerts in the U.S. and in Israel often performing with the likes of Shlomo Carlebach (The Singing Rabbi), the Rabbis' Sons and Theodore Bikel (a very famous Jewish folk singer and actor) and others of their ilk and reputation. The band received critical acclaim for their first album, but Rashi abruptly quit the band to pursue religious training in Israel.
The album is, today, hailed by record collectors as one of the rarest and most desirable records in the genre of Jewish Folk Music.
""This band was a groupie’s dilemma. Four single guys. A rock and roll lifestyle. A thumping folk sound that dripped from their hits such Chayil . The liner notes explain: “There once lived a great sage named Rashi whose prophetic commentary on both the written and oral Torah shed glorious light on its cosmic intricacies. Rashi is truly the name of the arranger of this album. His parents named him Rashi in the hope he would strive to attain even some of the greatness of the great sage. He developed the ability to play nine musical instruments including the Cordovox.” For the record, the Rishonim are Josh, Shelly, Heshy, Abbi, Steven, and Yussie.""
Personnel on the LP were Rashi Shapiro (vocals, Cordovox, guitar, harpsichord); Heshy Gruenberger (vocals (alto-tenor)), Shelly Lang (vocals, Duovox); Josh Neustein (vocals (baritone)); with Abby Warshaw, Yussie Lieber and Steven weiss on additional guitars, Yisroel Lamm and Sam Weiss on trumpets, Elliott Federman on drums, and Mickey Lane on bass guitar.

A Family Affair (musical)

A Family Affair is a musical with a book by James Goldman and William Goldman, lyrics by James Goldman and John Kander, and music by Kander. This was Kander's first show, and his only one written without Fred Ebb.
Production history.
Originally planned as a project for Gertrude Berg to be directed by Jerome Robbins, it opened in Philadelphia directed instead by Word Baker, who recently had staged "The Fantasticks" off-Broadway. With everything from the script to the score to the set in disarray, theatre producer Hal Prince was brought in to replace Baker and repair the damage. Poor box office prevented the out-of-town tryout from being extended and Prince, making his directorial debut, brought the show to New York City knowing it was better but still in need of serious work.
The Broadway production opened on January 27, 1962 at the Billy Rose Theatre, where it ran for 65 performances and five previews. The cast included neurotic comic Shelley Berman as Alfie, Eileen Heckart as Tillie, Rita Gardner as Sally, and Larry Kert as Gerry, with Morris Carnovsky, Cathryn Damon,
Bibi Osterwald, and Linda Lavin in supporting roles.
An original cast recording was released by United Artists Records.
Synopsis.
In Chicago, Gerry Siegal and Sally Nathan, a young suburban Chicago couple, decide to marry. The bride's Uncle Alfie (her guardian) wants an intimate wedding and wages a war of words with the groom's entire family. The groom's brassy Jewish mother Tillie commandeers the planning, steering it towards a large country club wedding (despite her husband's scolding her for taking over). Caterers, dressmakers, band leaders, rabbis, florists, photographers and a bossy wedding planner are pushed to the limit by the madcap preparations. The bride and groom, who have retained their sanity, realize that their families have almost destroyed the wedding. They announce their intention to have a quiet family affair.

<doc id="9919947" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9919947" title="Quietism">
Quietism

Quietism in philosophy is an approach to the subject that sees the role of philosophy as broadly therapeutic or remedial. Quietist philosophers believe that philosophy has no positive thesis to contribute, but rather that its value is in defusing confusions in the linguistic and conceptual frameworks of other subjects, including non-quietist philosophy. By re-formulating supposed problems in a way that makes the misguided reasoning from which they arise apparent, the quietist hopes to put an end to man's confusion, and help return to a state of intellectual quietude.
Quietist philosophers.
By its very nature, quietism is not a philosophical school as understood in the traditional sense of a body of doctrines, but still it can be identified both by its methodology, which focuses on language and the use of words, and by its objective, which is to show that most philosophical problems are only pseudo-problems.
The genesis of the quietist approach can be traced back to Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose work greatly influenced the Ordinary Language philosophers. One of the early Ordinary Language works, Gilbert Ryle's "The Concept of Mind", attempted to demonstrate that dualism arises from a failure to appreciate that mental vocabulary and physical vocabulary are simply different ways of describing one and the same thing, namely human behavior. J. L. Austin's "Sense and Sensibilia" took a similar approach to the problems of skepticism and the reliability of sense perception, arguing that they arise only by misconstruing ordinary language, not because there is anything genuinely wrong with empirical evidence. Norman Malcolm, a friend of Wittgenstein's, took a quietist approach to skeptical problems in the philosophy of mind. More recently, the philosophers John McDowell and Richard Rorty have taken explicitly quietist positions.

Chinese social structure

The social structure of China has an extensive history which stems from the feudal society of Imperial China to the contemporary era.
Confucianism.
The teaching of Confucius (551 BCE – 479 BCE) taught of five basic relationships in life:
For dynasties that used Confucianism (Not LegalismSon;2nd noted.
Early Imperial Period.
From the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty (221 BC-AD 1840), the Chinese government divided Chinese people into four classes: landlord, peasant, craftsmen, and merchant. Landlords and peasants constituted the two major classes, while merchant and craftsmen were collected into the two minor. Theoretically, except for the position of the Emperor, nothing was hereditary.
During the 361 years of civil war after the Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD), there was a partial restoration of feudalism when wealthy and powerful families emerged with large amounts of land and huge numbers of semi-serfs. They dominated important civilian and military positions of the government, making the positions available to members of their own families and clans. After the Tang dynasty's yellow emergence, the government extended the Imperial examination system as an attempt to eradicate this feudalism. 
Qing dynasty.
In the Qing dynasty, the lower classes of ordinary people were divided into two categories: one of them the good "commoner" people, the other the "mean" people. Prostitutes, entertainers, and low level government employees were the people in the mean class. The mean people were heavily discriminated against, forbidden to take the Imperial Examination, and mean and good people could not marry each other.
Social structure in modern China.
1911 to 1949.
After 1911, China entered the Warlord Era. During this time, industrialization was slow to non-existent; between the years 1920 and 1949, the industrial sector had only increased by less than three million members, mainly women and children working in cotton mills. The main changes in social structure were military.
In 1924, the Soviet Union helped Sun Yat-sen rebuild the Nationalist Kuomintang, GMT, and KMT military force, most notably through the Military Academy, an island on Pearl River near Guangzhou. Many military leaders of the following decades were Huangpu graduates, including Lin Biao, as well as nationalist Chinese generals.
After the allied forces of the Kuomintang and the Communists reunified China, Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of underworld forces such as the Green Gang, attacked the Communists. This had the effect of suppressing labor unions. 
1949 to 1976.
After 1949, the revolutionaries became the ruling class. The Communist Party cadres became the new upper class. The misuse and manipulation of the ration system by members of the cadre class threatened to change them into a new class of privileged bureaucrats and technicians, mere descendants of the pre-revolutionary ruling class of cadre technocrats and selected representatives of the old proletariat. Whereas in the past, their position had been accessed primarily through acceptance to the best schools, now cadre status came to give them access to materials and options not fairly distributed amongst all. Housing had always been in demand in China, particularly in the larger cities, and cadres were protected from the intense competition for living space.
In the countryside, the landlord class was eliminated during the land reform. In 1959, there were ten million state cadres, thirty-five million state workers, and two hundred million peasants. Chinese society was typical of agrarian societies because the peasant class composed the majority of the population.
Following the implementation of land reforms, Mao instituted a process of collectivization in response to the selling of land by peasants to the new generation of rich land owners. Afraid of creating a new landlord class, Mao instituted a system of communes where land was supposed to be worked equally by peasants. His idea was to capitalize on the sheer number of peasants and effectively produce a surplus harvest that would help industrialization. This was known as the Great Leap Forward, which was a failure and resulted in the deaths of twenty to thirty million peasants. 
Just as farmers were put into communes, state workers were placed in large work units called danweis. Since urban education reform was growing at a much faster rate than in rural areas, more and more workers were high school graduates. The slowing down of state industries and the increasing number of qualified middle class candidates contributed to the fact it became more and more difficult to obtain a position as a state worker. 
At this time, the hukou system was implemented, which divided the population into urban and rural residents. This was done to make distribution of state services through danweis and communes easier and to better organize the population in preparation for a possible invasion from the Soviet Union. The hukou system made it illegal to migrate from the countryside to the city. 
During the Cultural Revolution, the composition of society changed again. Schools were closed and many youth were sent down to the countryside putatively to learn from the peasants. Concern for peasants was reflected in the rural medical and educational services known as barefoot doctors and barefoot teachers. The life expectancy of peasants increased from less than forty years before 1949 to more than sixty years in the 1970s. At the same time, peasants were still the most illiterate, most powerless, and poorest social class. 
Access to state bank loans.
In all the annual meetings of the national congress and national political consultative conference, capitalist legislators and representatives always complain about the difficulties in getting loans from state banks. Most of them said that during the process of their development they never got one cent in loans, and complained that in their localities the standard bribe for a loan is as high as 20 to 30% of the loan. (Tsai, 2002)

Format.
The first half of the hour was an episode of "Dino-Riders"; the second half an episode of "RoboCop". Reruns of the 1981 "Spider-Man" cartoon (alternating with "Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends") were aired, making the program 90 minutes long in the US.

Series overview.
First-run series.
"Dino-Riders".
Dino-Riders was introduced primarily as a promotion to launch a new Tyco toy line. The series told the story of the Valorians, a peaceful race of telepathic humans whose home planet was conquered by the Rulon Empire. 400 survivors escaped on a space ship and time traveled to prehistoric Earth using the experimental Space-Time Energy Projector (also known as the S.T.E.P). But Emperor Krulos and his lead commanders accidentally followed them into the past when a tractor beam locked onto the Valorians' ship during the time jump. Stranded in the past, the two groups recruited the planet's dinosaur population into their struggle. The Valorians used their telepathy for taming dinosaurs to ride and for domestic use. The Rulons captured dinosaurs with 'brain boxes'. These were large metal helmets which fit onto dinosaur's heads and control their brains. Both Valorians and Rulons would often fit dinosaurs with huge arrays of laser and weapon platforms, upon which people could ride, and attack one another. Battles were mostly motivated by the Rulon's desire to steal the S.T.E.P. from the Valorians, and almost always inconclusive, seldom accomplishing more for either side than restoring the status quo from the beginning of the episode.
"Pryde of the X-Men".
Pryde of the X-Men is an unsold animated television pilot from 1989 starring the X-Men. The title is a pun based on the name of X-Men member Kitty Pryde, with the episode told, mostly, from her point of view. The pilot aired infrequently, often in the time slot held by "RoboCop".
"RoboCop: The Animated Series".
The animated version of RoboCop is based on the character and events of the movie of the same name. The series is a continuation from the movie, with Alex Murphy (RoboCop) still fighting to save the city of Old Detroit from assorted rogue elements, and on occasion, fighting to reclaim aspects of his humanity and maintain his usefulness in the eyes of the "Old Man", president of Omni Consumer Products (OCP). Many episodes see RoboCop's reputation put to the test or soured by interventions from Dr. McNamara, the creator of ED-260, the upgradable version of the Enforcement Droid Series 209 and the top competitor for the financial backing of OCP. McNamara often develops other mechanical menaces that frequently threaten RoboCop. On the home front, RoboCop is befriended as always by Officer Anne Lewis, but is also picked on and lambasted by the prejudiced Lieutenant Hedgecock, ever determined to be rid of him.
Rebroadcasts.
"Defenders of the Earth".
The animated television series from 1986, featuring characters from three comic strips distributed by King Features Syndicate—Flash Gordon, the Phantom, and Mandrake the Magician—battling the Flash Gordon villain Ming the Merciless in the year 2015. Supporting characters include their children Rick Gordon, Jedda Walker (daughter of the Phantom), Kshin (adopted son of Mandrake), Mandrake's assistant Lothar, and Lothar's son L.J. The show lasted for 65 episodes; there was also a short-lived comic book series published by Star Comics (an imprint of Marvel Comics). The closing credits credit Rob Walsh and Tony Pastor for the main title music, and Stan Lee for the lyrics.
The plot begins with Flash Gordon and his son Rick escaping from Ming the Merciless. Ming has exhausted all the natural resources of his home planet Mongo and has set his sights on Earth. Flash's wife Dale Arden is captured and Ming tries to brainwash her. She resists to the point of death.
"Dungeons & Dragons".
The 1983 animated television series based on TSR's "Dungeons & Dragons" role-playing game. A co-production of Marvel Productions and TSR. The show's story editors were Hank Saroyan (who voice directed the series) and Steve Gerber, both of whom contributed episodes and had a firm hand in the writing of the series. The level of violence was controversial for American children's television at the time, and the script of one episode, "The Dragon's Graveyard", was almost shelved because the characters contemplated killing their nemesis, Venger. In 1985, the National Coalition on Television Violence demanded that the FTC run a warning during each broadcast stating that "Dungeons & Dragons" had been linked to real life violent deaths. The series spawned more than 100 different licenses, and the show led its time slot for two years.
The general premise of the show is that a group of children are pulled into the "Realm of Dungeons & Dragons" by taking a magical dark ride on an amusement park roller coaster. Invariably, the children try to return home, but often take detours to help people, or find that their fates are intertwined with the fate of others.
Upon arriving in the Realm, the children are a little out of place, but the Dungeon Master, named for the referee in the role-playing game, assuming the role of their mentor, appears and gives them each a class and a magical item to suit that class.
"The Incredible Hulk".
The 1982 animated series based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. The series was based upon the Hulk comic in regards to the origin story (albeit with supposedly alien involvement rather than Soviet spies), as well as featuring characters from the comics including Rick Jones (who would often refer to Bruce as "Doc"), Major Ned Talbot, who was essentially the same character as Glenn Talbot (although perhaps a little less intelligent and more clumsy than his comic book counterpart and as a result of this is referred to by his men as Noodlehead Ned), Betty Ross, and General Ross, along with the first cartoon appearance of the She-Hulk. Yet only one classic Hulk villain appeared in a single episode of the series, The Leader, with a number of villains normally associated with other Marvel characters and newly created foes filling out the other episodes.
Also introduced were the Hispanic family of Rio and his daughter Rita, the father and his efforts to advertise his restaurant (Rio's Rancheros) providing more chances for comic relief and Rita providing a love interest for Rick Jones.
"The New Fantastic Four".
The 1978 animated series based on Marvel's comic book series Fantastic Four. The series replaced the character of the Human Torch with a robot named H.E.R.B.I.E., (Humanoid Experimental Robot, B-type, Integrated Electronics). A long-lasting rumor stated that this change was made by the TV network (NBC) because executives did not want young viewers to imitate the Human Torch by setting themselves on fire. This rumor proved to be untrue, as the 1978 television rights to use that character were tied up by a proposed television pilot movie in development by Universal Studios (now a sister company to NBC) that ended up never being produced.
"Spider-Man"/"Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends".
The 1981 syndicated version of Spider-Man was based on the popular Marvel Comics character of the same name. The series featured Peter Parker having to balance his alter ego crimefighting with his responsibilities as a university student, a part-time photographer for the "Daily Bugle" and caring for his elderly Aunt May. Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, which originally aired on NBC around the same time, featured Spider-Man, Iceman, and Firestar. In this incarnation, the three superheroes are all college students at Empire State University, who operate as the "Spider-Friends" as the superheroes battle various supervillains.
"Spider-Woman".
The 1979 animated television series, based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Woman. According to the title sequence, Jessica Drew (voiced by Joan Van Ark) was bitten by a poisonous spider as a child; her father saved her life by injecting her with an experimental "spider serum," which also granted her superhuman powers. As an adult, Jessica is editor of Justice Magazine, with two other employees featured; photographer Jeff and Jessica's teenage nephew Billy. When trouble arises, Jessica slips away to change into her secret identity of Spider-Woman.
The animated Spider-Woman's powers are noticeably modified; her enhanced strength in particular seems entirely missing, as she is shown in several episodes being restrained by means (such as ordinary rope) that her super-strong comic-book counterpart could easily break. In addition to the ability to cling to walls. The animated Spider-Woman also has the ability to change into costume merely by spinning around.
"Marvel Action Hour".
During the second season of "The Marvel Action Hour", the series was given the revived "Marvel Action Universe" banner in some markets.

Trevelyan College Boat Club

Trevelyan College Boat Club (TCBC) is the boat club of Trevelyan College, at Durham University.
An active north eastern rowing club, it competes on a national level, for example at Henley Royal Regatta and the Head of the River Race. It is recognised as one of the more prominent Durham College Rowing Clubs. The club runs under the leadership of a structured executive committee and benefits from an annual intake of around thirty novice rowers each year. The club was founded officially in 1976, although there was a history of rowing at the college earlier with the first boat bought in 1966. It is recorded that an all fresher crew won the Ladies Invitation Race at the university Epiphany Term Regatta in 1967.
The alumni club for ex-TCBC members is Drowning Horse Boat Club, a humorous play on Trevelyan College's Coat of Arms.
Boathouse and facilities.
The club is currently housed opposite Durham Amateur Rowing Club east of the city centre and upstream of the 750m racecourse, in a boathouse shared by Josephine Butler College Boat Club, St John's College Boat Club and Durham Amateur Rowing Club, although other colleges have been known to store boats there. In the past the club has been housed at Hatfield College's Boathouse.
The club's fleet include two 8+s, six 4+s, one 4x+, one 2x/2- and five 1xs. The club also uses Trevelyan College's gym for fitness training and runs a circuit session once a week in term time.
Executive committee.
The club is run under a structured exec that is elected at the AGM of the boat club, run at the end of epiphany term. The social secretaries of the boat club organise the annual boat club ball held in easter term; "Bash on the Bish" (although recently entitled Gash on the Bish and Lashy on the Bishy), which is held on the Prince Bishop river boat.
Recent history.
In recent years the club has been highly successful. In 2007, the club won the S4 4+ category at the Rutherford Head on the River Tyne, and the Tees Small Boats Head in the S3 4+ Category. In inter-colliegiate events the club won the Senate Cup.
In 2008 the success of the boat club resulted in members being chosen along with members of St Cuthbert's Society to represent the University in the Junior 8+ category at BUSA Regatta in Glasgow. At the same time a crew composed entire of Trevelyan rowers competed as the University in the Junior 4+ category, where they won a bronze medal. That year the club also won Durham Small Boats Head S4 4+ category, won the Chester-Le-Street Regatta WN 4+ category, and lost in the final of Durham Regatta in the S4, S3 and S2 4+ categories, in composite crews with Ustinov and Van Mildert Colleges. The club also won the Dyfrig Williams Trophy for the fastest men's 4+ overall in the University Pennant Series. The men's first 4+ also qualified for the Prince Albert Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta, losing to the University of Bristol. 
In 2009 it was decided that the club had been too long without owning any 8+s, previously the club would train in 8+s owned by Josephine Butler College. The club now owns two 8+s. 2009 also saw TCBC win the 4+ category in the Butler College Novice Head of the River race, at the same time setting the fastest time record for any category.
In summer 2010, the clubs novice men's four won Hexham Regatta. In 2010-11 TCBC club entered many head races starting with The Fuller's Head of the River Fours. The Mens 4+ won the Senate Cup Intercollegiate Race regaining the trophy from when the college was last victorious in 2007. The regatta season saw a victory at Durham City Regatta in a Novice Double, a series of successful races saw the 1st four advance to the final of Durham Regatta, but a clash of blades in the opponent's lane in the first part of the race saw the four disqualified, even though they finished two lengths ahead of the opponent.

"Smallville".
On the hit TV series "Smallville" James Marshall had an important role throughout the history of the show. As go-to-guy Greg Beeman stopped directing the high profile "Smallville" episodes (due to his commitment to the Heroes) TV series, series creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar began to look to James Marshall, who first began directing on "Smallville" during the second half of the first season. After producing "Smallville" for many years, starting at season seven Marshall became an executive producer on the show. With this position Marshall began directing fewer episodes, and in season nine he directed no episodes, returning to the director's chair once in season 10.

Henry Stanhope, Lord Stanhope

Henry Stanhope, Lord Stanhope KB (died 29 November 1634), known as Sir Henry Stanhope until 1628, was an English nobleman and politician.
He was the second and next surviving son of Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield and his first wife Catherine Hastings, daughter of Francis Hastings, Lord Hastings, oldest son of George Hastings, 4th Earl of Huntingdon. Amongst his younger brothers were Ferdinando Stanhope and Arthur Stanhope, while his nephew was James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope. He entered the English House of Commons in 1625, sitting for Nottinghamshire in the following two parliaments until 1626. In the third parliament of 1628, he represented East Retford until the next year. At the coronation of King Charles I of England in 1625, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Bath.
On 4 December 1628, he married Katherine Wotton, daughter of Thomas Wotton, 2nd Baron Wotton in Boughton Malherbe in Kent. They had two daughters and two sons. The first son, Wotton, died in infancy and the second, Philip, succeeded his grandfather as earl. Stanhope died intestate in St Martin-in-the-Fields, London and was buried in Boughton Malherbe three days later. Having been governess of Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange and having supplied the royal troops with money and weapons during the English Civil War, his wife was created Countess of Chesterfield for life by King Charles II of England after the English Restoration.

<doc id="9920139" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9920139" title="Ground dipole">
Ground dipole

In radio communication, a ground dipole, also referred to as an earth dipole antenna, transmission line antenna, and in technical literature as a horizontal electric dipole (HED), is a huge, specialized type of radio antenna that radiates extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves. It is the only type of transmitting antenna that can radiate practical amounts of power in the ELF frequency range of 3 Hz to 3 kHz. A ground dipole consists of two ground electrodes buried in the earth, separated by tens to hundreds of kilometers, linked by overhead transmission lines to a power plant transmitter located between them. Alternating current electricity flows in a giant loop between the electrodes through the ground, radiating ELF waves, so the ground is part of the antenna. To be most effective, ground dipoles must be located over certain types of underground rock formations. The idea was proposed by U.S. Dept. of Defense physicist Nicholas Christofilos in 1959.
Although small ground dipoles have been used for years as sensors in geological and geophysical research, their only use as antennas has been in a few military ELF transmitter facilities to communicate with submerged submarines. Besides small research and experimental antennas, three full-scale ground dipole installations are known to have been constructed with one more under construction; two by the U.S. Navy at Republic, Michigan and Clam Lake, Wisconsin, one by the Russian Navy on the Kola peninsula near Murmansk, Russia. and one in India under construction and expected to be operational by 2015. The U.S. facilities were used between 1985 and 2004 but are now decommissioned.
Antennas at ELF frequencies.
ELF frequencies (according to one of several definitions) range from 3 Hz to 3 kHz, with corresponding wavelengths from 100,000 km to 100 km. The frequency used in the U.S. and Russian transmitters, about 80 Hz, generates waves 3750 km (2300 miles) long, roughly one quarter of the Earth's diameter. ELF waves have been used in very few manmade communications systems because of the difficulty of building efficient antennas for such long waves. Ordinary types of antenna (half-wave dipoles and quarter-wave monopoles) cannot be built for such extremely long waves because of their size. A half wave dipole for 80 Hz would be 1162 miles long. So even the largest practical antennas for ELF frequencies are very electrically short, very much smaller than the wavelength of the waves they radiate. The disadvantage of this is that the efficiency of an antenna drops as its size is reduced below a wavelength. An antenna's radiation resistance, and the amount of power it radiates, is proportional to (L/λ)2 where L is its length and λ is the wavelength. So even physically large ELF antennas have very small radiation resistance, and so radiate only a tiny fraction of the input power as ELF waves; most of the power applied to them is dissipated as heat in various ohmic resistances in the antenna. ELF antennas must be tens to hundreds of kilometers long, and must be driven by powerful transmitters in the megawatt range, to produce even a few watts of ELF radiation. Fortunately, the attenuation of ELF waves with distance is so low (1 - 2 dB per 1000 km) that a few watts of radiated power is enough to communicate worldwide.
A second problem stems from the required polarization of the waves. ELF waves only propagate long distances in vertical polarization, with the direction of the magnetic field lines horizontal and the electric field lines vertical. Vertically oriented antennas are required to generate vertically polarized waves. Even if sufficiently large conventional antennas could be built on the surface of the Earth, these would generate horizontally polarized, not vertically polarized waves.
History.
In 1958, the realization that ELF waves could penetrate seawater led U.S. physicist Nicholas Christofilos to suggest that the U.S. Navy use them to communicate with submarines. The U.S. military researched many different types of antenna for use at ELF frequencies. Cristofilos proposed applying currents to the Earth to create a vertical loop antenna, and it became clear that this was the most practical design. The feasibility of the ground dipole idea was tested in 1962 with a 42 km leased power line in Wyoming, and in 1963 with a 176 km prototype wire antenna extending from West Virginia to North Carolina.
How a ground dipole works.
A ground dipole functions as an enormous vertically oriented loop antenna "(see drawing, right)". It consists of two widely separated electrodes "(G)" buried in the ground, connected by overhead transmission cables to a transmitter "(P)" located between them. The alternating current from the transmitter "(I)" travels in a loop through one transmission line, kilometers deep into bedrock from one ground electrode to the other, and back through the other transmission line. This creates an alternating magnetic field "(H)" through the loop, which radiates ELF waves. The axis of the magnetic field produced is horizontal, so it generates vertically polarized waves. The radiation pattern of the antenna is directional, with two lobes (maxima) in the plane of the loop, off the ends of the transmission lines. In the U.S. installations two ground dipoles are used, oriented perpendicular to each other, to allow transmission in all directions.
The amount of power radiated by a loop antenna is proportional to (IA)2, where I is the AC current in the loop and A is the area enclosed, To radiate practical power at ELF frequencies, the loop has to carry a current of hundreds of amperes and enclose an area of at least several square miles. Christofilos found that the lower the electrical conductivity of the underlying rock, the deeper the current will go, and the larger the effective loop area. Radio frequency current will penetrate into the ground to a depth equal to the "skin depth" of the ground at that frequency, which is inversely proportional to the square root of ground conductivity σ. The ground dipole forms a loop with effective area of A = Lδ / √2, where L is the total length of the transmission lines and δ is the skin depth. So ground dipoles are sited over low conductivity underground rock formations (this contrasts with ordinary radio antennas, which require "good" earth conductivity for a low resistance ground connection for their transmitters). The two U.S. Navy antennas were located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, on the Canadian Shield (Laurentian Shield) formation, which has unusually low conductivity of 2×10−4 siemens/meter. resulting in an increase in antenna efficiency of 20 dB. The earth conductivity at the site of the Russian transmitter is even lower.
Because of their lack of civilian applications, little information about ground dipoles is available in antenna technical literature.
U.S. Navy Project ELF antennas.
After initially considering several larger systems (Project Sanguine), the U.S. Navy constructed two ELF transmitter facilities, one at Clam Lake, Wisconsin and the other at Republic, Michigan, 145 miles apart. They could operate independently, or phase synchronized as one antenna for greater output power. The Clam Lake site, the initial test facility, transmitted its first signal in 1982 and began operation in 1985, while the Republic site became operational in 1989. The total radiated output power of both sites working together was 8 watts. However due of the low attenuation of ELF waves this tiny radiated power was able to communicate with submarines over about half the Earth's surface.
Both transmitters were shut down in 2004. The official Navy explanation was that advances in VLF communication systems had made them unnecessary.
Russian Navy ZEVS antennas.
The Russian Navy operates an ELF transmitter facility, named ZEVS ("Zeus"), to communicate with its submarines, located northwest of Murmansk on the Kola peninsula in northern Russia. Signals from it were detected in the 1990s at Stanford University and elsewhere. It normally operates at 82 Hz, using MSK (minimum shift keying) modulation. although it reportedly can cover the frequency range from 20 to 250 Hz. It reportedly consists of two parallel ground dipole antennas 60 km long, driven at currents of 200 to 300 amperes. Calculations from intercepted signals indicate it is 10 dB more powerful than the U.S. transmitters. Unlike them it is used for geophysical research in addition to military communications.
Radiated power.
The total power radiated by a ground dipole is
where
The radiated power of an electrically small loop antenna normally scales with the fourth power of the frequency, but at ELF frequencies the effects of the ionosphere result in a less severe reduction in power proportional to the square of frequency.
Receiving antennas.
Ground dipoles are not needed for reception of ELF signals. The requirements for receiving antennas at ELF frequencies are less stringent than transmitting antennas, because the signal to noise ratio in ELF receivers is dominated by the large atmospheric noise in the band. The level of signal strength at the antenna is far above the noise in the receiver circuit, so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used. Various types of coil and ferrite loop antennas have been used for reception.

Kitty Walker

Katherine Anne "Kitty" Walker (previously McCallister) is a fictional character on the primetime show 
"Brothers & Sisters". She is played by actress Calista Flockhart. In a two-part 2010 episode, actress Kay Panabaker portrayed a teenage Kitty Walker in flashback sequences set in 1986.
Character history.
Background.
Kitty Walker is the second eldest of the Walker family, born in late September 1968, although she is first child of William and Nora (as Sarah Walker was not of William's, biologically). Kitty shared the conservative beliefs of her father, William, and brother, Tommy. Being Republican, Kitty always clashed with her mother, Nora, who is more liberal. Even though they love each other, their relationship is somewhat complicated.
One of the reasons for their misunderstanding was because of younger brother Justin. Kitty supported his decision to join the army whereas Nora was completely against it, especially after Justin was deployed to Afghanistan. From that point until Kitty's return to Los Angeles the two had barely spoken to each other. Until she returned for a visit for her birthday, Kitty had not been home in several years. She had been living in New York City, and witnessed the fall of the Twin Towers during the September 11 attacks.
Season 1.
Kitty quit her job in New York as a radio host after she was offered the opportunity to be a part of the political show ("Red, White and Blue") in Los Angeles, despite the fact that her then fiancé, Jonathan, didn't want her to. Unable to work things out, they broke up.<br> After the sudden death of her father, Kitty discovered, alongside with the rest of the Walker family, that her father had been cheating on her mother and had embezzled money from the company pension fund, putting the family business at risk. Feeling betrayed and vulnerable, Kitty slept with cohost Warren Salter, further complicating things with Jonathan, who wanted to reconcile with her. Soon after, they ultimately decided it was for the best if they broke up permanently. Jonathan returned to New York. Kitty was therefore free to pursue an affair with Warren but he was hesitant, as he was already involved with his young assistant, Amber. Warren finally asked Kitty out, and she accepted on the condition that he set things straight with Amber. When Kitty discovered that he didn't do so, she realized they didn't have a future together.
When Kitty's brother Justin was called to fight in Iraq, she asked one of her guests, Senator Robert McCallister, for his help, but he refused. After another failed attempt to make him change his mind, Kitty apologized in front of her audience. Even though she admitted she had made a mistake, she didn't regret it and decided to leave the show. Robert was nonetheless impressed by her frankness. After much persuasion from Robert, Kitty became his communications director. Even though it was obvious that they were attracted to each other, Kitty was reticent at first, wanting to take a "man fast". The two of them nevertheless started dating soon after. Most recently after the campaign helicopter that she and Robert were scheduled to fly on crashed, Kitty asked McCallister to marry her. Later, the Senator proposed and Kitty accepted.
Season 2.
In Season 2, Kitty continues to plan her wedding to Robert, but when she discovers she is pregnant, the wedding is pushed forward to save the Senator from scandal of having a child out of wedlock. When Kitty eventually miscarries her child, the wedding is put off. After Kitty and Robert marry, their main goal is to have another child; after in vitro fertilization fails, the couple decide to look at adoption. Kitty is also revealed to have written a tell all book about the campaign with Robert and calls in an old friend, Isaac Marshall (played by Danny Glover) to help with the press and Robert's political image. When brother Kevin marries Scotty at the end of the season, it's Kitty who performs the ceremony.
Season 3.
In Season 3, Kitty and Robert are married and starting the adoption process. She asks Sarah to write a recommendation for her and Robert. However, Sarah asks Nora to do it as she doesn't have time. Kitty, suspicious, questions Sarah about the letter and finds out that Nora wrote it, leading to a slight rift between them. Sarah then writes the letter. 
Later, Robert tells Kitty that he has heard rumours that someone in his administration has written a book about his failed presidential campaign. It is revealed that Kitty wrote the book and accidentally leaves it at her mother's home. Nora and Justin read the book and tell the others. They read the book and see that Kitty is talking about them negatively. Kitty and Robert then have them all over for a regular Walker dinner for the social worker. The dinner goes horribly, Nora spills water on the social worker, who leaves. Nora and Kitty then get into an argument. Robert, to everyone's surprise, stands up to Nora and defends Kitty. She explains that she used her family to describe certain aspects about the typical voter. Robert, who is slightly angry about the book, reads it and tells her it's brilliant. However, if Kitty publishes it, she will have to resign as his Communications Director. In the episode "Bakersfield", Kitty is upset because Robert told her he was going to Washington but, in fact, went to Iraq to see the effects of the war. She is initially hurt, fearing he will always put his career ahead of his family. While Robert is away, Kitty gets a call from the adoption agency with the news that a woman who is six months pregnant would like them to have her child. When she calls Robert with the news, his overjoyed reaction persuades her to forgive him.
When Robert returns to the States, they set up a meeting with the birth mother at the hospital she works at. She is a brain surgeon who plainly didn't have time for the baby. After the conversation, everything seemed to be going well and both parties were excited. This was until Kitty decided to go back to the hospital and question Trish (the birth mother) if she was 100% sure that she would go through with the adoption, and Trish was insulted that Kitty would doubt her. She ultimately told Kitty that she would find another set of adoption parents. Kitty was devastated that she had messed their chance up and Robert was upset with Kitty for returning to the hospital without discussing it with him. In a later episode, Trish phoned Robert and Kitty apologizing for "freaking out" when Kitty had questioned her, and thanked her for giving her a chance to rethink her decision, which remained the same. She told them that if they can trust her again, she would be happy to give them her baby. Although Robert was skeptical, Kitty was elated.
After Robert suffers a heart attack, her and Robert's marriage begins to deteriorate as he sinks into a deep depression and secretly launches plans to run for governor of California and, Kitty is left to deal with a recovering Robert and their infant son, Evan. She then meets a man named Alec who is a single father and they two slowly bond and become flirtatious. When Robert eventually discovers things it snaps him out of his depression but he becomes upset with Kitty. While in Mexico visiting Tommy, he asks her if she loves him and at first she doesn't know but chases after him, only to find herself too late as his chopper has already taken off.
Season 4.
In season 4, it is known that Kitty has been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, which will bring the family closer than ever. She starts chemotherapy, then considers stopping it in lieu of herbal remedies and positive thinking. She discovers hair loss from the treatment and shaves her head. She, Robert and Evan all move in with Nora during Kitty's treatment so she can help with Evan during Kitty's weakened state. Though the cancer is seemingly awful news it seems to bring Kitty and Robert closer and repairs their relationship. On the day of Justin and Rebecca's wedding Kitty learns that the chemotherapy has not worked and that in fact her cancer has spread. However, she purposely neglects to tell Robert and her family because she doesn't want to spoil the occasion. During the ceremony as she is reading a poem by e.e. cummings, Kitty passes out and her family rushes to her aid. Justin reveals that she isn't breathing and starts mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Kitty is resuscitated at the hospital where her doctor reveals that her cancer has indeed advanced and spread and suggests a dangerous bone marrow transplant, which Kitty favors but Nora doesn't.
Robert becomes angry with Kitty for keeping her advanced cancer from him, but they reconcile and he asks her to renew their vows when Kitty chooses the bone marrow transplant over more chemo-therapy. However, all the Walker siblings are tested and it is revealed that none of them are a match. In desperation Nora turns to Ryan and asks him to get tested and it is revealed that he is a match but doesn't want to donate his marrow as he blames the Walkers (in place of William) for his mother's suicide. Nora tries to tell him that she is angry with William as well but that he must move on. Nora also tells Ryan that by not helping Kitty, Evan will lose his mother, like Ryan did. However, it appears he leaves town in order to escape his sabotaging the wine at Ojai. Just as everyone begins to lose hope, Ryan returns after sorting through what Nora said and donates his marrow to his half-sister. The story then jumps three weeks later as Robert holds a press conference, it is revealed that the transplant was a success and Robert concedes his bid for governor and Ryan seemingly makes amends with the Walker family.
Kitty has since begun to run for Robert's senate seat after he decided to step down. Robert is now involved with a group trying to gather evidence on Stanton, a politician. After he catches on to Robert he threatens to derail Kitty's campaign should he go ahead with his information. In the season finale, the Walker family is involved in a massive highway accident. Robert is severely injured, but persuades Justin, who is a med student, to help the others while he waits for an ambulance. Kitty stays with Robert in the car and pleads with him to survive.
Season 5.
A year later, Kitty is tending to Robert, who has been in a vegetative coma since the accident. She insists he can recover, ignoring the rest of the family's doubts. She's offered a job taking his spot in the RNC, but she refuses as it would take her away from him. She blames Justin for what happened, saying Justin should have tended to Robert at the accident site, but Justin replies Robert wanted him to help Holly. A talk with Nora makes Kitty realize Robert will never wake up and finally decides to shut off his life support. Mourning her husband, she decides she'll be okay as she prepares to move on with her life.
Eventually she rents a house in Ojai to 'find herself' again. She meets a man, Jack, and they soon evolve their relationship into a romantic one. Kitty is worried to begin with that their relationship won't work because of their different personalities. Jack reveals that he used to work in the city and would move back there if he got to be with Kitty. Once there, however, he begins to become heavily involved in his job and makes plans to move to a different country. Kitty says she can't go because of her family and her son. When they realize that their lives are at different points, they end their relationship.
Soon after this, Kitty is offered a job as a lecturer at Waxley University, which she accepts. Whilst there, a young graduation student named Seth asks her out. Although hesitant because of their age gap, Kitty agrees to go out with him. Their relationship goes well until she finds out his mother is the Dean at Waxley and worries she may lose her job. It turns out that she believes her son is not good enough for Kitty, which only makes Kitty more sure of her feelings. When Kitty leaves for DC, she tells her family she is going for business meetings and breaks things off with Seth. It is later revealed that there were some complications with her bone marrow and her cancer was at risk of returning. Once being given the all clear, she returns home and asks Seth for another chance to which he agrees. They then take a trip to Boston together. Kitty returns to support Sarah when she finds out that Brody is her father. On Sarah's wedding day, she reveals that she is pregnant with Seth's child.

Ontario Highway 98

King's Highway 98, commonly referred to as Highway 98, was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario, designated as part of the provincial highway system from 1938 to 1970. The route travelled through the northern part of Essex County and through south-central Chatham-Kent, extending from Windsor to Blenheim.
The route's function within the provincial transportation network was eventually superseded by Highway 401, and the highway was decommissioned in 1970. The road is now in operation solely as a network of county roads.
Route description.
Highway 98 travelled from Windsor to Blenheim via Maidstone, Tilbury, Merlin and Charing Cross. The route is known by various names today: Howard Avenue, Provincial Road, Middle Road and Middle Line; as well as by various designations: Essex County Road 46 and Chatham-Kent Road 8.
The route began in downtown Windsor at the intersection of Outlette Avenue and Riverside Drive. That intersection also served as the terminus for Highway 3B, Highway 18, and Highway 39; Highway 2 continued through the intersection to meet Highway 3 at the Ambassador Bridge. Highway 2, Highway 3B, Highway 39 and Highway 98 travelled south concurrently along Oulette Avenue to Tecumseh Boulevard, at which point Highway 3B branched west along that road while the others turned east. At Howard Avenue, Highway 39 continued east while Highway 2 and Highway 98 turned south. They travelled concurrently to Cabana Road / Division Road, where Highway 2 split onto Division Road and Highway 98 onto Provincial Road.
Highway 98 left Windsor as it encountered an interchange with Highway 401 (Exit 14). It travelled southeast, parallel to and north of Highway 3, to Maidstone. There, the highway curved and became Middle Road. It followed this road east, occasionally jogging northeast, while passing through Comber and south of Tilbury, where it left Essex County and entered what is now the municipality of Chatham-Kent. Continuing east, now as Middle Line, the route encountered the communities of Valetta, Stewart and Merlin before curving northeast. It bisected South Buxton before encountering Charing Cross and turning east. It continued for a short distance into Blenheim, where it ended at Highway 3 (Talbot Street).
History.
This road's purpose was to be an alternate route for people travelling on Highways 2 and 3 before Highway 401 opened in 1952. The highway's original length was only 55 km (stretching from Windsor to Tilbury), and was originally known as Highway 2A from 1929 to 1938.
In 1941, the road was extended by 40 km when a new township road in Kent County, extending to Blenheim, was uploaded as Highway 98. This brought the highway up to its maximum length.
Originally, this road was designated as Highway 2. When Highway 2 was first numbered (in 1925, though it was in provincial power since 1917), it started at the ferry dock between Dougall Avenue and Ouellette Avenue in downtown Windsor, concurrent with Highway 3. Highways 2 and 3 travelled down Ouellette Avenue to Tecumseh Road, where it made a short three-block jog west to Dougall Avenue. It then travelled south to Talbot Road, and headed east along Talbot Road to Malden Road in Maidstone.
From here, Highways 2 and 3 parted ways. Highway 3 continued to Essex and Leamington (via County Road 34's present alignment), while Highway 2 travelled up Malden Road to Middle Road (Essex CR 46), and continued to Tilbury, Chatham, London and points east.
Before 1929, Highway 18 connected Windsor to Tilbury along today's County Road 42/Division Road, while Highways 2 and 3 were concurrent along Ouellette Avenue from the Ferry Docks (located between Howard Avenue and Ouellette Avenue) to Talbot Road. They split company at Maidstone (today's junction of County Road 34 and Former Highway 114). Highway 3 would continue through Essex, Ontario to Leamington and points east, while Highway 2 followed Malden Road (Former Highway 114) to Middle Road (What would become Highway 2A, then Highway 98, ultimately today's County Road 46).
1929: The Great Renumbering.
In 1929, the Ambassador Bridge opened, offering the first direct and permanent link to Detroit. This caused a cascade of route re-numberings in the Windsor and Maidstone areas.
Highway 2 was rerouted along North Talbot Road, and diverted onto the newly built Provincial Road, leading northwest to Howard Avenue. At Howard, the road turned west along Tecumseh Road to Ouellette Avenue, turning north and terminating at the ferry docks. Highway 3 would be routed along the newly built Huron Church Road to the Ambassador Bridge.
Since Base Line Road (today's County Road 42/Division Road) was much quicker than Highway 2's former alignment along Middle Road, the province decided to extend Highway 18 from Tilbury to Leamington, and to have Highway 2 absorb its Windsor-Tilbury segment. The former routing of Highway 2 (along Middle Road) became Highway 2A (then Highway 98, and today's CR 46).
In 1931, Highway 2 was re-routed along County Road 42's current path, and the precursor to Highway 98 was re-designated as Highway 2A, and this lasted until 1938, when it was re-designated as Highway 98.
Replacement by Highway 401.
When the section of Highway 401 opened in 1952 between Windsor and Tilbury, traffic began to decline, favouring the more direct and faster freeway over the two-lane road. Upon the completion of Highway 401's four lanes (having been twinned in 1965), traffic declined rather sharply, and this once-important alternate highway had lost its reason for existence, almost overnight. It was downgraded and removed from the provincial highway network in early 1970.
Until the great highway downgrading spree of 1997-98, this was the longest provincial highway entirely lost to downgrading.
Today the route is split into Essex County Road 46 and Chatham-Kent Municipal Road 8.

Russian School Defense Staff

Russian School Defense Staff or Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools (; ) — movement in Latvia for protection of public secondary education in Russian. Leaders: Vladimir Buzayev, Gennady Kotov, Yury Petropavlovsky, Miroslavs Mitrofanovs, Mihail Tyasin, Viktor Dergunov, Vladislav Rafalsky, for some time also Alexander Kazakov (deported out of Latvia in 2004), one of the most prominent spokesmen — Yakov Pliner.
Aims of the movement.
Cancelling the Education law provisions, which originally ordered the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) to be only Latvian (later - at least 60% Latvian) since 2004. It also supports providing effective learning of Latvian language in the Latvian language and literature lessons and specific preparation of teachers for Russian schools.
History.
The Staff was founded in April 2003 as a coalition of various organizations, most prominent being ForHRUL, and later expanded, involving nonpartisan people. In 2003–2004, the Staff has organized political demonstrations (according to the Freedom House and political scientist T. Boguševiča, the biggest ones in Latvia since the beginning of the 1990s) to protest to expanding use of Latvian language in Russian schools.
As a result, the Education law was amended in February 2004, allowing to teach up to 40% in the forms 10-12 in minority languages. The proportion of teaching 60% of subjects in Latvian and 40% in Russian, according to BISS research, was supported by 20% of the teachers, 15% of pupils and 13% of parents in minority schools and most stated that they would rather support bilingual instruction in all subjects; only 15% of teachers thought that no reform was needed, while this opinion was expressed by 36% of parents and 44% of pupils. The parliamentary opposition started two cases before the Constitutional Court of Latvia (abjudicated in May and September, 2005) with most of its demands being refused.

Lou Dillon

Lou Dillon (1898, near Santa Ynez, California—January 15, 1925, near Santa Barbara, California) was a Standardbred trotting horse. She was the first trotter to trot a mile in under 2:00, at Memphis in 1903.
The mare Lou Dillon, by Sidney Dillon out of Lou Milton, was foaled in 1898 by the Pierce Brothers Stock Farm near Santa Ynez, California. She was a two-time great-great-granddaughter of Hambletonian. Her owner was Henry Pierce, who never raced her professionally. She was trained initially by Charles Tanner, who drove her in many amateur events. Later her workouts under Millard Sanders (1856-1928) were sensational, and she attracted a lot of attention. She was high strung and hard to handle. Sanders was the only man who knew her.
Henry Pierce refused to sell her, even for the $20,000 offered by E.E. Smathers in 1903. Ten days after this offer was made, Pierce suddenly died in San Francisco. All his stock was sold at a dispersal sale in Cleveland. C.K.G. Billings bought Lou Dillon, and she again went into training with Millard Sanders. Billings, too, refused to race her professionally. She did run exhibitions against time, to sulky, high-wheeler and saddle, but no Grand Circuit stakes.
In 1903 at the Readville Trotting Park, she became the first trotter to register 2:00 for the mile. On October 24, 1903 she bettered her own mark, trotting 1:58½ at Memphis. This record astounded the racing world. Four days later in Memphis she raced 2:00 drawing a four-wheel wagon, Billings driving. With her new-found fame, she began an exhibition tour of the United States and Europe, driven by Billings and Sanders. She thrilled spectators in Berlin, Moscow and Vienna.
Lou Dillon never returned to the great form she had shown in 1903. In 1904 she was involved in a doping scandal at the Memphis Gold Cup (innocently — a rival doped her to prevent her from winning.) She was retired in 1906, and died at the age of 26 in 1925. She was buried in Santa Barbara, near where Lou Dillon Lane is found today. Her original gravestone is now on display at the Harness Museum in Goshen, New York.

Jamie Pierre

Matthew Jamison "Jamie" Pierre (February 22, 1973 – November 13, 2011) was a professional free skier. Pierre set a world-record cliff jump of at the Grand Targhee Resort in Wyoming. He skied away with a bleeding cut lip from being hit by a shovel when his partners dug him out of his 12 foot bomb hole. Google's Sergey Brin had estimated that Pierre was almost at terminal velocity when he hit the ground. Pierre died in November 2011 in an avalanche.
Life.
Matthew Jamison Pierre was born February 22, 1973. According to the London Daily Telegraph, out of eight children, Jamie was third; he was born a son of Pam and Gerard Pierre. Jamie started skiing at age ten at Buck Hill, Minnesota, and quickly picked up the craving for more. He graduated high school and decided to live life as a “skibum”. Jamie worked menial jobs to pay for his expensive passion at various resorts with his brother, Chris Pierre. In 1995, he was able to enter an extreme skiing competition, the beginning to many adventures. Jamie Pierre spent the next ten years progressing his skiing and the size of cliffs he jumped. However, at age 32 in 2005 he got married and had a daughter. Pierre decided, ”The plan is to ski more, fall out of the sky less”.
Film career.
By being one of the few skiers known for going the biggest, Pierre played a key role in some of the major ski films of his time. This work included parts in many different film companies, including Warren Miller, Teton Gravity Research, Matchstick Productions Flying Circus and Rage Films. While working for Warren Miller, Pierre took parts in five movies: Cold Fusion in 2001, Journey in 2003, Off the Grid in 2006, Playground in 2007 and Children of Winter in 2008.
World Record Huck.
Jamie Pierre was known for pushing the limits of skiing off cliffs. He began to be followed by the media in 1999 when a black and white photo appeared in Powder Magazine of Pierre leaping off a forty foot cliff. The size of the cliffs he was jumping were increasing quickly, starting at 50 feet, and soon were up to 90 feet. His first 100 footers were off of crags in Utah. “Pierre began to question how high he could go. What were the limits?” Soon Jamie Pierre was jumping a cliff 165 feet in Wolverine Cirque Utah; he cleared this monster cliff in 2003. In Engelberg, Switzerland he cleared a 185 foot cliff around March 2004. Before settling down, Pierre wanted to go big, bigger than anyone else had before. The record at the time was jumped at 225 feet and Jamie Pierre wanted to beat it. After scoping out many cliffs, he finally decided on one, a 255 footer in the backcountry of Grand Targhee resort. “Hail Mary” are the words Jamie yelled before hucking his body off this world record cliff. Around a dozen people were watching, including photographers, family, friends, and spectators. Plunging headfirst into the snow, Jamie Pierre got that three seconds of the feeling he had always craved. Finally, he held the world record for landing the tallest cliff on skis on Jan 25, 2006. In 2008 Fred Syversen beat this record by surviving a 351 foot cliff, unintentional by Syversen, and may or may not count.
Life with Drugs and Christianity.
Born into a Lutheran family, Jamie Pierre went to church with his family every Sunday as a kid. As he grew up, however, he fell out of religion; he still believed in God, but he did not follow his religion devoutly. At age fourteen, he began to smoke marijuana, a habit that followed him for the next fifteen years. He also drank excessive amounts, sometimes to the point that he would just blackout and not wake up until the next morning. This continued for many years as he lived his life as a skier and through his pro career. He chose to rededicate his life to Jesus, and practiced his faith for the rest of his life.
Death.
On November 13, 2011 Jamie Pierre was hiking at Snowbird Resort in Utah to ski some early season snow. The resort was not open and no avalanche control had been done. Pierre and his friend, Jack Pilot, were planning to ski the area known as South Chute. He triggered an avalanche that rolled him over rocks for 800 feet. According to "The New York Times", “He came to a stop partly buried and died of trauma”. He is survived by his wife, and two children, a daughter and a son.

Rock 'n' Roll Children

"Rock 'N' Roll Children" is the sixth single released by heavy metal band Dio, appearing on their 1985 LP, "Sacred Heart". It reached number 26 on the "Billboard" Top Album Tracks chart.
Rock 'n' Roll fairy tale.
Rock 'N' Roll Children is a song exemplary for Dio’s style of blending the theme of rock ‘n’ roll with fantasy elements. It is about boy and a girl, meant for each other and at the same time hostile opposites, ending up alone in the dark. The song seems to be closely connected to the song Sacred Heart of the same album, which is about a quest imposed by a wizard to find the sacred heart bleeding in the night; in Rock 'N' Roll Children the fall in the darkness of the couple is expressed as the breaking of a heart. 
Some of the elements in the lyrics of the song Sacred Heart are used in the music video of Rock 'N' Roll Children. In this video, two kids get in trouble and end up in antique store named Curios. The store belongs to the wizard played by Ronnie James Dio, who seems to have some secret involvement in the matter of their trouble. They hide in a closet and disappear in the nightmare world of the wizard, separate of each other. This dark world of the wizard reflects ordinary society, a hostile world for children of rock 'n' roll, because they don’t want to be enslaved by its rules and authority figures. In the end they find each other and the wizard's game is over.

Morris Almond (born February 2, 1985) is an American professional basketball player who is currently a free agent.
High school.
Almond was born in Dalton, Georgia and attended McEachern High School in Powder Springs, Georgia, where he was a teammate of fellow professional basketball player Josh Smith.
College career.
Almond played college basketball at Rice University, where he was a member of Martel residential college. During his junior season, Almond's scoring average jumped to 21.9 points per game (up from 7.2 points per game as a sophomore). His scoring average led all players in Conference USA.
During his senior year, Almond's scoring average increased to 26.4 points per game, ranking third in the nation. He was named Conference USA Player of the Year and was named AP All-America Honorable Mention.
Almond finished his career at Rice with 121 games played and a scoring average of 15.1 points per game. He was also the first Rice basketball player to appear on the cover of a national publication. After graduation, he was selected by the Utah Jazz in the first round (25th pick) in the 2007 NBA Draft.
Professional career.
Almond played in 9 games during his rookie season with the Jazz, averaging 4.3 minutes. His NBA career high is currently 12 points, at Sacramento on December 2, 2008. He scored his first NBA points on January 8, 2008 against the Indiana Pacers, with 2 points on 1-of-5 shooting. However, he spent most of the season with the team's D-League affiliate, the Utah Flash, to whom he was assigned. He led the D-League in scoring during the season, averaging 25.6 points per game. In just his fifth game with the team on December 21, 2007, he tied a league record with 51 points in a 118–116 victory over the Austin Toros. Later in the season, he broke the record with a 53-point performance against the Bakersfield Jam in a 102–87 win. The record was tied by Will Conroy in 2009 and surpassed by Pierre Jackson in 2014 (58).
On September 18, 2009, Morris Almond signed with the Orlando Magic. He was waived on October 21, 2009. Almond later played for the Maine Red Claws and Springfield Armor of the NBA Development League. He then signed with Real Madrid Baloncesto of the Spanish ACB. In July 2010 he left Real Madrid and joined the Italian club Scavolini Pesaro.
In January 2012, Almond returned to the United States and signed with the Maine Red Claws for the second time. On the 16th of April 2012, the Washington Wizards announced they would be signing Almond to contract for the rest of the 2011-12 season. At the end of the 2011-2012 season he was selected to the All NBA D-League Third Team after averaging 23.4 points and 6.0 rebounds per game for the Red Claws.
Almond briefly played for Red Star Belgrade during the 2012–13 season. He then returned to the Maine Red Claws, who traded him to the Iowa Energy.
On January 30, 2013, he and Mike Taylor were traded to the Los Angeles D-Fenders in exchange for Jarrid Famous.

Dunwoody High School is a public high school in Dunwoody, an incorporated city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. Dunwoody High School also serves students in the unincorporated areas and sections of Doraville.
Dunwoody, with students attending in grades 9-12, follows a four by four block schedule, in which students attend four classes every day for 90 minutes. The school is operated by the DeKalb County School System.
In 1988, Dunwoody merged with another local high school, Peachtree High School. Peachtree became a middle school and Dunwoody remained as the high school. Dunwoody's previous colors were crimson and gold and their mascot was the Wildcats. Peachtree's colors were red, white, and blue and their mascot was the Patriots. As part of a compromise between the two schools during the merger, Dunwoody agreed to change its colors to red, white, and blue while keeping its wildcat mascot. Prior to the merger, Dunwoody High School had an eighth grade, which is now part of Peachtree Middle School.
On December 17, 2012, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools announced that it had downgraded the DeKalb County School System's status from "on advisement" to "on probation" and warned the school system that the loss of their accreditation was "imminent." On January 21, 2014, the association announced that the Dekalb County School System was no longer in danger of losing accreditation.

<doc id="9920481" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9920481" title="Reggae Reggae Sauce">
Reggae Reggae Sauce

Reggae Reggae Sauce is a Jamaican jerk spice, popularised by creator Levi Roots' appearance on BBC2's "Dragons' Den".
Dragon's Den investor Peter Jones has since classified the product as one of his most successful investments from the show.
History.
On 7 February 2007, Levi Roots appeared on "Dragons' Den" and convinced Peter Jones and Richard Farleigh to invest £50,000 in return for 40% of his company. The sauce gained fame as a result of his memorable television appearance and on 9 February, Sainsbury's were confirmed to be interested in stocking it. On 7 March, the sauce went on sale nationwide.
The product's catch line is "Put some music in your food". Levi Roots released an accompanying single of his "Reggae Reggae Sauce Song" which he sang whilst pitching his product on "Dragons' Den", and also on Harry Hill's "TV Burp". The song was released as a download with proceeds going to Comic Relief. In September 2008, Reggae Reggae Sauce was voted as a CoolBrand by a panel of experts and the British public.
Controversy over the product's origins.
The origin of the recipe is disputed by Tony Bailey, who runs a West Indian takeaway in Brixton, South London; "The recipe is mine. People round here know, but we don’t say."
In 2010, Bailey filed a preliminary claim in the High Court for more than £300,000 claiming that, as the inventor of the sauce, he was entitled to a share of profits.
Roots ran a jerk chicken stall at the Notting Hill Carnival for 15 years with Bailey. Levi Roots gave evidence to the High Court and admitted that previous claims made by him on Dragons Den and in marketing for his product, including the claim that the recipe was his grandmother's, were untrue.
However, Judge Mark Pelling QC dismissed Mr Bailey's claims for breach of contract and breach of confidence. He told the court: "This was a dishonest claim, dishonestly advanced." No solid evidence had been offered to support Mr Bailey's claim that he was the original inventor of the sauce. Lawyers said they estimated the legal battle had cost more than £1m in total and the judge said Mr Roots was entitled to have his costs paid.
Production and Expansion.
Reggae Reggae Sauce is manufactured by "G Costa", a division of Associated British Foods.
Despite Levi saying he wanted production of his sauce to continue in the UK, production moved from Wales to Poland in March 2007.
Initially the sauce was carried exclusively in Sainsbury's supermarkets but now many supermarkets in the UK and Ireland stock the sauce. A follow-up episode of "Dragons' Den", aired on 18 July 2007, revealed that Sainsbury's had expected the sauce to sell 50,000 bottles in its first year. In fact it sold 40,000-50,000 bottles per week.
In the first half of 2008, Roots launched "Love Apple Tomato Sauce" and "Fiery Guava Dipping Sauce" in the same style as Reggae Reggae sauce. A cookbook called "Reggae Reggae Cookbook" was released in June 2008. The "Love Apple Tomato Sauce" was later renamed "Reggae Reggae Tomato Ketchup".
Restaurants Subway, JD Wetherspoon, Hungry Horse, Slug and Lettuce as well as the Scream Pub chain now offer the sauce on various menu items. In July 2009, Birds Eye released chicken Chargrills in Reggae Reggae Sauce.
In the summer of 2010, snacks were added to the range of products with the launch of Reggae Reggae Peanuts and Cashews. These peanuts are covered in the original Reggae Reggae Sauce and seasonings. Subsequently a range of Reggae Reggae flavoured Caribbean ready meals was launched.
In September 2010, Morrisons supermarket announced it would be carrying a range of Levi Roots sandwiches.
In April 2011, Domino's Pizza in the UK launched a limited edition "Reggae Reggae Pizza", a combination of toppings with the Reggae Reggae sauce. In 2012 KFC launched a reggae reggae box meal.
The range has expanded into other areas such as Levi Roots Jamaica Ginger Cake and Levi Roots Caribbean Crush drink which is sold in mainstream UK supermarkets.
In 2012, a new "Mild" variant of the sauce was released. A new advert was made at the same time.

I Epomeni Kinisi

I Epomeni Kinisi is a Greek album by singer Anna Vissi released in Greece and Cyprus in 1986 by CBS Greece. This album is all written by Nikos Karvelas. In spite of her previous albums, it featured a clear pop sound, very distinctive of Vissi's next albums. The album reached platinum status and was one of the best-selling albums of 1987 in Greece.
Album information.
As the two number one singles from the previous album "Kati Simveni" were written by Karvelas, her label accepted Vissi's suggestion for the next album to be written entirely by Karvelas. The result was a pop album with 10 songs. Notable is the fact that this is the first album CBS Greece released on CD, simultaneously with the original vinyl release, though it was re-released in 1996.
Music.
Music and lyrics on the album are by Nikos Karvelas. Anna Vissi and Giorgos Mitsigas contributed as the lyricists of two songs.

<doc id="9920555" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9920555" title="Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome">
Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome

Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe insulin resistance. The disorder is caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Symptoms include growth abnormalities of the head, face and nails, along with the development of acanthosis nigricans. Treatment involves controlling blood glucose levels by using insulin and incorporating a strategically planned, controlled diet. Also, direct actions against other symptoms may be taken (e.g. surgery for facial abnormalities) This syndrome usually affects children and has a prognosis of 1-2 years.
Symptoms.
The symptoms of Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome vary from case to case. Major symptoms of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome include abnormalities of the teeth and nails, such as dental dysplasia, and deformities of the head and face, which include a coarse prematurely-aged facial appearance with a prominent jaw. A skin abnormality known as acanthosis nigricans, which involves a discoloration (hyperpigmentation) and “velvety” thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the skin around skin fold regions of the neck, groin and under arms is also a common symptom. Symptoms will negatively impact the daily life of the patient, and will persist until treated.
Minor symptoms may include an enlargement of the genitalia and precocious puberty and a deficiency or absence of fat tissue. Due to the fact that individuals with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome fail to use insulin properly, they may experience abnormally high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) after eating a meal, and abnormally low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) when not eating.
Diagnosis.
A combination of clinical findings and laboratory tests are used to diagnose Rabson-Mendenhall Syndrome. Initially, individuals are screened for symptoms and have their blood sugar levels analyzed. The two principle tests used to determine insulin resistance are the fasting plasma glucose test (FPG) and the oral glucose tolerance test (GTT). Results from a patient with severe insulin resistance will show values exceeding healthy ranges (≤99 mg/dL for FPG and ≤139 mg/dL for GTT) by over 50 units. A genetic history is also established to determine risk of recurrence in the family. Based on the combination of these findings, an appropriate diagnosis is made.
Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is commonly associated with donohue syndrome, also known as "leprechaunish'. Both diseases are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations on chromosome 19. Severe insulin resistance and an irregular enlargement of the genitalia are also overlapping symptoms.
Mechanism.
The condition is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait, and often affects children of consanguineous parents. The physical findings and symptoms vary greatly among each individual.
Genetic diseases are determined by two genes, one from the mother and one from the father. Recessive genetic disorders occur when an individual inherits the same abnormal gene for the same trait from each parent. If one of the inherited genes is normal, while the other is for the disease, the person will only be a carrier and will not display any symptoms. 
The risk for two carrier parents to both pass the defective gene and, therefore, have an affected child is 25 percent with each pregnancy. The risk to have a child who is a carrier like the parents is 50 percent with each pregnancy. The chance for a child to receive normal genes from both parents and be genetically normal for that particular trait is 25 percent. 
Researchers have determined that the Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is caused by mutations of the insulin receptor gene. The insulin receptor gene is located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 19. Mutations of the insulin-receptor gene lead to an alteration of structure or reduced number of insulin. This results in reduced binding of insulin, and may also lead to abnormalities in the post-receptor pathway. 
Individuals with Rabson-Mendenall syndrome will need ways to compensate for their insulin resistance, and may do this by increasing insulin secretion. This can lead to excessive insulin levels in the blood (hyperinsulinemia), which can be responsible for multiple symptoms. Definitive genotype–phenotype correlation for insulin receptor defects is difficult to establish primarily due to the rarity of these syndrome. However, researchers believe more severe phenotype changes are due to a mutation in the alpha subunit of the receptor.
Treatment and Prognosis.
There is no known cure for Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. However, a series of steps can be directed towards treating the specific symptoms. For example, surgery may be performed to treat dental abnormalities. Furthermore, the goal of the treatment is also to maintain blood glucose levels as constantly as possible. Insulin is not as effective at normal doses, and even large doses show minimal effects. Frequent feeding is the most effective treatment to control blood glucose levels. Well thought out meals with complex combinations of carbohydrates are put together and assigned to the patient in hope of seeing a constant glucose level maintained. Though effective, these treatments tend to show more of an impact initially, and can become ineffective within months.
Treatment of Rabson–Mendenhall syndrome with pharmacologic doses of human leptin may result in improvement of fasting hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, basal glucose, and glucose and insulin tolerance.
Quality of life is impacted severely and the prognosis of patients with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome remains poor. This is due to the lack of a long term treatment. Life expectancy is 1-2 years.
Clinical presentation.
Rabson and Mendenhall described 3 sibling (2 girls, 1 boy) who initially presented with dental and skin abnormalities, abdominal distention, and phallic enlargement. The children demonstrated early dentition, a coarse, senile-appearing facies, and striking hirsutism. An "adult growth of hair of head" at 5 years of age was pictured in the case of one of the girls. In the older girl the genitalia were large enough at the age of 6 months to permit vaginal examination for diagnosis of a left ovarian tumor which was removed soon afterward. The children were mentally precocious. Prognathism and very thick fingernails as well as acanthosis nigricans were also described. Insulin-resistant diabetes developed, and the patients died during childhood of ketoacidosis and intercurrent infections. At autopsy pineal hyperplasia was found in all three.
Biologically, infants display fasting hypoglycemia, postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, which progress to permanent hyperglycemia and recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis.
Recent Research.
Recent research has been directed towards finding better treatment options. Multi-drug therapy using insulin sensitizers, such as metformin and pioglitazone, has been linked to improving residual insulin action. High doses of insulin-like growth factor 1 has also been effective in patients with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. Future studies are also focusing on the relation between genotype and phenotype. Though there is no cure, researchers remain optimistic on finding a cure.

Political positions of John Edwards

Here are some of Senator John Edwards's votes and remarks on various issues.
Economic Policy.
End Poverty in 30 Years.
One of Edwards' main themes as a political figure is the problem of poverty in America. He believes that poverty can be cut by one third by 2016 and eliminated by 2036. He supports adoption of the National Academy of Science's recommendations for measuring poverty, which he claims would add 1 million people to the "poverty" class. His plan involves several tactics. These include stronger families, better schools and government-funded housing vouchers. Edwards argues in favor of creating one million housing vouchers over five years in order to place poor people in middle-class neighborhoods and in areas where jobs are available. He also supports strengthening labor unions and raising the minimum wage to $8.40. Edwards has stated, "If we truly believe that we are all equal, then we should live together too."
College for everyone.
Edwards has stated that if people agree to work part-time during their first year at a public-college, the government should pay for their tuition, books and fees.
Edwards has advocated his College for Everyone program based on proposal made in his 2004 campaign and the successful College for Everyone pilot program that Edwards and the Carolina non-profit organization Promise and Opportunity Foundation began at Greene Central High School in Snow Hill, North Carolina, a high school in rural eastern North Carolina with a high percentage of economically disadvantaged students.
Under Edwards' College for Everyone program, the government would help all qualified students pay for college tuition, fees and books for college students who agree to work part-time ten hours a week if they "complete coursework that prepares them for further education, stay out of trouble, and enroll in a participating public university or community college." Funds would be provided for two million students.
Other aspects of the plan include strong preparation in high school, with College for Everyone students being required to complete a college-prep curriculum in high school and Edwards administration "working with school districts to strengthen high school curricula." 
The most significant part of the College for Everyone is its proposed overhaul of the student loan program. Edwards has called for an end to large federal subsidies for banks that make student loans, which would free up $6 billion. Instead, subsidies would be replaced with loans directly from the U.S. Department of Education, "receiving loans that have very similar terms but are far less expensive for taxpayers."
Energy Independence and Stopping Global warming.
John Edwards' positions on energy are documented on his 2008 Presidential Campaign website.
In March 2007 he was the first presidential candidate to make his campaign “carbon neutral.” He started buying carbon offsets to reduce his carbon emissions and having his offices buy recycled paper products. 
One of the main focuses of his campaign was fighting global warming. He has said "Why has America not addressed global warming in a serious way? There's a very simple answer for that. Oil companies, power companies, gas companies and their lobbyists in Washington, D.C." He voted against drilling in the Arctic five times, and supports the standard that would require renewable sources to be the source of 10 percent of America's electricity by 2020.
Edwards endorses the widespread goal of 80% reductions of greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by the year 2050. He has denounced the Bush administration for not signing the Kyoto treaty and supports the McCain-Lieberman bill to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This would involve capping emissions, reducing the cap every year, and auctioning off the right to emit a certain quantity of greenhouse gases. He would then use this estimated $10 billion to fund research for alternative energy sources, in an effort to end the United States reliance on imported foreign oil.
Social Policy.
National Service.
John Edwards opposes a military draft.
Abortion.
Edwards supports legal access to abortion. He received a 100% rating from NARAL each year he was in the Senate, indicating a pro-choice voting record. He also supports public funding for abortion services for low-income women. Edwards issued a press statement saying he was "saddened" by the passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and described this law as "offensive to women." Although absent from the official vote, Edwards had voted against the bill in previous versions.
LGBT issues.
During his 2004 Vice Presidential run, Edwards stated he was opposed to same-sex marriage. In late December 2006, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, Edwards said, "Do I believe they should have the right to marry? I'm just not there yet..." Edwards opposes a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, preferring to leave that decision up to individual states. He supports the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). He does support letting states decide on civil unions and partnership benefits.
Immigration.
Edwards supported the expansion of the H-1B visa program to increase the number of work visas for immigrant workers. Edwards supports expanding legal immigration to the United States while working with Mexico to provide better border security and stop illegal trafficking.
On February 7, 2007 Edwards said in a Cox News Service Q&A that "We want to change the immigration system, so people can get on the path to citizenship."
Civil liberties.
Edwards voted in favor of the 2001 version of the USA PATRIOT Act along with all but one senator, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin. He subsequently criticized the Bush administration for "abusing its powers in implementing the Act." Edwards was no longer in the Senate when the Patriot Act was reauthorized.
Cannabis legalization.
Edwards has said he is against the legalization of recreational "Cannabis". He currently supports legal use of marijuana for medical purposes. He said that if given doctors' approval, seriously ill patients should be allowed to use marijuana.
Health care.
On February 5, 2007, Edwards unveiled his plan for universal health care. The plan subsidizes health insurance purchases for poorer Americans, requires that all Americans purchase health care, "requires that everybody get preventive care," and requires employers to offer health insurance through the Medicare system as one option for their workers. Since Medicare has lower administrative costs — under 4%, versus 20% or more for many HMOs — Edwards believes that individuals will be able to save on health care by using the public option. While it is not a single-payer plan, the plan states that "over time, the system may evolve toward a single-payer approach if individuals and businesses prefer the public plan." and make Medicare the de facto national health program.
Edwards said "The bottom line is we're asking everybody to share in the responsibility of making health care work in this country. Employers, those who are in the medical insurance business, employees, the American people — everyone will have to contribute in order to make this work." The plan includes methods for cutting costs in the health care system and creation of revenue sources.
Cost Containment.
There are six ways in which Edwards proposes to reduce costs in the health care system.
Revenue sources.
The total public cost of the plan would be $90–$120 billion per year, paid for by eliminating the 2001 tax cuts for individuals earning more than $200,000 per year. Employers would be required to either cover their employees or to pay a payroll tax that will be used to partially fund regional health insurance pools (called "Health Markets") that are overseen by the federal government. Individuals who are not covered by their employers or by an expanded Medicaid program (covering individuals and families with incomes up to 250% of the poverty level) or Medicare will be required to purchase insurance from these Health Markets. Insurance companies must compete to win the right to be one of the providers in these Health Markets and must provide full comprehensive care (including mental health parity). In addition, one of the insurance plans will be directly provided by the federal government (similar to, but separate from Medicare). If a majority of individuals choose to purchase their insurance from the government plan, Edwards has stated that this could eventually lead to a single-payer health care system. In addition, there will also be a broad subsidy for those individuals who have to purchase insurance on their own. The subsidy is given on a sliding scale to individuals and families making up to roughly $100,000 per year (this is a significantly larger subsidy than is provided in the Massachusetts health care plan, another mandated insurance program).
Foreign Policy.
War on Terrorism.
Edwards has criticized the handling of the War on Terrorism by the Bush Administration. Edwards feels that the War on Terrorism was misnamed: "It is now clear that George Bush's misnamed 'War on Terror' has backfired — and is now part of the problem."
He went on later to say, "The War on Terror is a slogan designed only for politics, not a strategy to make America safe. It's a bumper sticker, not a plan."
Iraq and the Middle East.
Edwards voted for the 2002 Iraq War Resolution, and was one of 16 Senators to co-sponsor an early version of that bill, Joe Lieberman's S.J Res 46, which was not brought to the floor for a vote. Three years after the war began, in November 2005, Edwards said that the decision to go to war in Iraq was a mistake. He apologized for his vote, saying that the intelligence reports which led to the decision were "deeply flawed and, in some cases, manipulated to fit a political agenda." He favors gradual troop withdrawal and concurrent training of Iraqi troops, as well as removing American contractors, instead awarding such reconstruction contracts to Iraqi businesses to promote the Iraqi economy and reduce unemployment in Iraq.
On January 14, 2007 Edwards spoke at New York City's Riverside Church as keynote speaker at a Martin Luther King Day commemoration. In the speech Edwards criticized silence on the "escalation of the war in Iraq," reminding people about King's vocal opposition to the Vietnam War forty years earlier. 
In a February 2007 appearance on "Meet the Press", Edwards told Tim Russert, "over time, when I reflected on what I thought was going to be necessary going forward, to have some moral foundation to work on issues like poverty and genocide, things that I care deeply about, I could no longer defend this vote. It was pretty simple. And I got to the place I felt like I had to say it and had to say it publicly. And so— what? — a year — a year or so ago I did that." He subsequently apologized for that military authorization vote.
Edwards was a vocal critic of the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, calling the surge the "McCain Doctrine" in reference to Sen. John McCain's support for the strategy. He has stated that he cannot guarantee to pull all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by the end of the next presidential term in 2013, but added he would "immediately draw down 40,000 to 50,000 troops." In October 2007, Edwards called for limits on the role of private military contractors in Iraq and elsewhere. At the beginning of 2008, Edwards proposed withdrawal of all troops from Iraq in the first 10 months if he became president.
Despite President Bush's vetoes of funding bills with withdrawal timetables, Edwards urged Congressional Democrats to not acquiesce, but instead to continually present bills that include such timetables.
Crime.
When asked how to prevent inner city kids from participating in violence, Edwards said, with implied criticism of "The idea that we're just gonna keep incarcerating, keep incarcerating, pretty soon we're not going to have a young African-American male population in America. They're all going to be in prison, or dead. One of the two." Instead of supporting such a notion, he said the government should spend more money on health care and education in order to prevent young people from leading a life of crime.
The Media.
Edwards supports net neutrality. In addition, he has outlined a plan that will establish high-speed internet availability to all American homes and business by the year 2010.
He is also a vocal critic of the Fox News Channel. He has accused the network of having a "right-wing agenda" and lacking objectivity in their reporting. He has boycotted debates hosted by the network, saying "there's just no reason for Democrats to give Fox a platform."

May–Hegglin anomaly

May–Hegglin anomaly (MHA), also known as Dohle leukocyte inclusions with giant platelets and macrothrombocytopenia with leukocyte inclusions, is a rare genetic disorder of the blood platelets that causes them to be abnormally large.
History.
MHA is named for German physician Richard May (January 7, 1863 – 1936) and Swiss physician Robert Hegglin. The disorder was first described by Richard May in 1909 and was subsequently described by Robert Hegglin in 1945.
Pathogenesis.
MHA is believed to be associated with the "MYH9" gene. The pathogenesis of the disorder had been unknown until recently, when autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA ("MYH9") were identified. Unique cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are aggregates of nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA, and are only present in granulocytes. It is not yet known why inclusion bodies are not present in platelets, monocytes, and lymphocytes, or how giant platelets are formed. Interestingly, "MYH9" is also found to be responsible for several related disorders with macrothrombocytopenia and leukocyte inclusions, including Sebastian, Fechtner, and Epstein syndromes, which feature deafness, nephritis, and/or cataract. MHA is also a feature of the Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis with sensorineural hearing loss).
Presentation.
In the leukocytes, the presence of very small rods (around 3 micrometers), or Dohle bodies can be seen in the cytoplasm.
Treatment.
In many cases, MHA requires no treatment. However, in extreme cases, blood platelet transfusions may be necessary

The one million masterpiece

The One Million Masterpiece (abbreviated OMM) is the largest artistic collaboration ever attempted. It is an ongoing project to produce a true piece of global artwork. As of October 16, 2007, 26,582 artists from 174 countries have participated, with $19,348.57 raised for charities worldwide.
The original project website was launched on July 14, 2006 by London based artist Paul Fisher. The site uses an Adobe Flash drawing tool to enable members to contribute images drawn on screen using a mouse or digipad, and an AJAX viewer which displays the whole artwork mosaic.
The website has developed and further social networking elements have been added. Artists can rate one another's contributions, communicate via messages and maintain a profile page.
Participation.
Participation is free to anyone with access to the internet. Participants are each given a square where they can use a built-in drawing tool to create an image. (These individual images combined are what will make up the final project as a giant mosaic.) The project is open to, and intended for, all willing participants. One need not be artistically trained, in order to participate.
Celebrity Involvement
Celebrity contributors include Peaches Geldof, electric violinist Linzi Stoppard, playwright Tom Stoppard, doctor and health commentator Miriam Stoppard, Frankie Goes to Hollywood frontman and artist Holly Johnson, cult comedy icon Karl Pilkington, businessman and socialite Sebastien Sainsbury and Supremes band member Susaye Greene.
Aims.
Artistic and Charitable
The One Million Masterpiece aims to produce a piece of public artwork that will provide a snapshot of global society. It is intended that the final artwork be completed for unveiling on World Population Day 2008 and hopes to raise over $1 million for the projects charity partners Save the Children, Oxfam, ActionAid and World Cancer Research Fund. 
World Record
The artwork also officially qualifies as a new world record. The previous official record for the most artists completing a single picture was held by the painting A Little Dab of Texas, designed by Jim Campbell of Brenham, Texas, USA. The picture was painted by 25,297 people and was completed in 3 years, 7 months on June 14, 1998.
Recurring Elements Within Image (Space Monkeys).
As the project is still underway, it is largely wondered whether the final image will have a thematic unity or if it will be a chaotic series of unrelated images. Many recurring elements can be found throughout the work. The most notable of these recurring elements are what have been dubbed "space monkeys." Space monkeys are small circular faces, typically cartoonish in nature and rudimentary in style. They are believed to have originated within Laura Dixon's picture -- but they soon began to appear in pictures throughout the project.
Other common recurring elements include: views of the earth from space, eyes, hearts, and flowers.
Video Replay of Drawing Process.
The OMM site's adobe drawing tool includes a feature that enables a video replay of the drawing process for each picture. This feature has led several participants to not only create digital paintings, but also digital videos. Angeli Arndt uses this feature in her artwork entitled "I'm Always Changing For You," to show a human face changing over time. This video functionality adds a dimension to the project that is not noticeable when simply viewing still images of the project. 
Exhibition.
When completed The One Million Masterpiece will measure 80 metres in width and 31 meters in height and each individual contribution will be a 5cm by 5cm square. It is proposed that the final piece will be printed and unveiled in Central London on World Population Day 2008. 
Controversy.
There has been controversy within the OMM community regarding content of individual artworks. Some participants have complained that certain artworks are pornographic and/or obscene. Occasionally, a participant will demand that the artwork of another participant be deleted.

<doc id="9920687" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9920687" title="Turks in the Netherlands">
Turks in the Netherlands

Turks in the Netherlands (occasionally "Dutch Turks" or "Turkish-Dutch") (; ) are the ethnic Turks living in the Netherlands who form the third largest ethnic group after the Dutch people, other European Union people and Indonesians.
History.
Until 1961, more people left the Netherlands than moved into the country. It began to face a labour shortage by the mid 1950s, which became more serious during the early 1960s, as the country experienced economic growth rates comparable to the rest of Europe. At the same time, Turkey had a problem of unemployment, low GNP levels and high population rates. So the import of labour solved problems on both ends. The first Turkish immigrants arrived in the Netherlands in the beginning of the 1960s at a time were the Dutch economy was wrestling with a shortage of workers. On 19 August 1964, the Dutch government entered into a 'recruitment agreement' with Turkey. Thereafter, the number of Turkish workers in the Netherlands increased rapidly.
There were two distinct periods of recruitment. During the first period, which lasted until 1966, a large number of Turks came to the Netherlands through unofficial channels. An economic recession began in 1966. Some of the labour migrants were forced to return to Turkey. In 1968, the economy picked up again and a new recruitment period, which was to last until 1974, commenced. The peak of Turkish labour migration occurred during these years. The Turks surpassed other nationalities in numbers and came to represent the Dutch image of "guest workers".
Demographics.
Turkish immigrants first began to settle in big cities in the Netherlands such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht as well as the regions of Twente and Limburg, where there was a growing demand for industrial labour. However, not only the capital cities but also medium-sized cities, and even small villages attracted the Turks.
The Turkish population is mostly concentrated in large cities in the west of the country some 36% of Turks live in the Randstad region. The second most common settlements are in the south, in the Limburg region, in Eindhoven and Tilburg, and in the east, in Twente region, in Enschede, Deventer, and Almelo.
According to Statistics Netherlands, as of 2009, the total population of the Netherlands is 16,485,787. The Turkish population is 378,330, thus 2.29% of the total population. This consisted of some 196,000 first generation Turks and 183,000 second generation Turks whose parents originated from Turkey. The total number of third generation Turks is not recorded in Statistics Netherlands. However, Turkish language is spoken by 700,000 people in the Netherlands.
Other Turkish communities.
The official estimates of the Turkish immigrant population in the Netherlands does not include Turkish minorities whose origins go back to the Ottoman Empire. In the Netherlands, there are also Bulgarian Turks and Western Thracian Turks. These populations, which have different nationalities, share the same ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious origins as Turkish nationals.
Bulgarian Turks.
10,000-30,000 people from Bulgaria live in the Netherlands. The majority, of about 80%, are ethnic Turks from Bulgaria; most of them have come from the south-eastern Bulgarian district of Kardzhali ("Kırcaali") and are the fastest-growing group of immigrants in the Netherlands.
Western Thrace Turks.
A minority of Western Thrace Turks can be found in the Netherlands, especially in the Randstad region. They are registered as Greeks due to their Greek nationality. After Germany, the Netherlands is the most popular destination for Turkish immigrants from Western Thrace.
Culture.
Language.
The first generation of Turkish immigrants is predominantly Turkish-speaking and has only limited Dutch competence. Thus, for immigrant children, their early language input is Turkish, but the Dutch language quickly enters their lives via playmates and day-care centres. By age six, these children are often bilinguals.
Adolescents have developed a code-switching mode which is reserved for in-group use. With older members of the Turkish community and with strangers, Turkish is used, and if Dutch speakers enter the scene, a switch to Dutch is made. The young bilinguals therefore speak normal Turkish with their elders, and a kind of "Dutch-Turkish" with each other. 
Religion.
When family reunification resulted in the establishment of Turkish communities, the preservation of Turkish culture became a more serious matter. Most Turks consider Islam to be the centre of their culture. Thus, the majority of Dutch Turks adheres to Sunni Islam, although there is also a considerable Alevi fragment. According to the latest figures issued by Statistics Netherlands, approximately 5% of the Dutch population (850,000 persons), were followers of Islam in 2006. Furthermore, 87% of Turks were followers of Islam. The Turkish community accounted for almost 40% of the Muslim population; thus are the largest ethnic group in the Netherlands adhering to Islam.
Turks are considered to be the best organised ethnic group with its activities and organisations. The "Turkish Islamic Cultural Federation" (TICF) which was founded in 1979, had 78 member associations by the early 1980s, and continued to grow to reach 140 by the end of the 1990s. It works closely with the "Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs" (Diyanet), which provides the TICF with the imams which it employs in its member mosques.
In April 2006, the Turkish Mevlana Mosque had been voted the most attractive building in Rotterdam in a public survey organised by the City Information Centre. It had beaten the Erasmus Bridge due to the mosques 'symbol of warmth and hospitality'.
Politics.
Turks generally support parties on the left (PvdA, D66, GroenLinks, and SP) over parties on the right (CDA, VVD and SGP). In the past, migrants were not as eager to vote, however they are now aware that they can become a decisive factor in the Dutch political system. There has been some criticisms that certain parties (such as the Social Democrats) are becoming "the parties of migrants" because of the votes they receive from migrants and the increase in the number of elected Turkish candidates. During the Dutch general election (2002), there were 14 candidates of Turkish origin spread out over six party lists which encouraged 55% of Turks to vote, which was a much higher turnout than any other ethnic minorities.
Literature.
A number of Turkish-Dutch writers have come to prominence. Halil Gür was one of the earliest, writing short stories about Turkish immigrants. Sadik Yemni is well known for his Turkish-Dutch detective stories. Sevtap Baycili is a more intellectual novelist, who is not limited to migrant themes.

Vance Longden

Vance Longden (March 14, 1930 - January 7, 2003) was an American Thoroughbred horse trainer based in California.
Vance Longden was the son of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey Johnny Longden and his first wife, Helen. He was raised around horses and apprenticed with trainer William Molter. At age twenty-three, Vance Longden was training on his own and using his father to ride some of his horses. Together, and as part of the Alberta Ranches, Ltd. partnership, they successfully raced a number of horses including the 1953 Hollywood Gold Cup winner Royal Serenade, the 1955 U.S. Champion Turf Horse St. Vincent, plus Four-and-Twenty, winner of the 1961 Santa Anita Derby. The North American Pari-Mutuel Regulators Association says they are perhaps the only father-son, jockey-trainer duo ever to win major races at major tracks.
Longden also raced a few seasons at Hastings Racecourse in Vancouver, British Columbia where he won thirty-six stakes races. In 1961 Vance Longden had two starters in the Kentucky Derby, both finishing off the board.
Vance Londgen battled throat cancer for several years and eventually was only able to speak through the use of a voice box. His illness forced his reirement from racing and he was living in Arcadia, California at the time of his death in 2003.

Everything I Am

Everything I Am is the title of the debut English-language album by Greek singer Anna Vissi. It was created under Vissi's affiliation with Sony Music Entertainment international who granted her collaboration with successful American songwriters and producers. However, the album was never officially released in the United States after Sony Music Entertainment decided to withdraw from supporting Vissi's global career expansion. The album was subsequently first released in Greece and Cyprus on October 24, 2000 by Columbia Records. The album was certified gold in Greece, and platinum in Cyprus.
Album information.
Release.
The album was released internationally in select countries through Sony Music Entertainment Netherlands, the branch which also housed the Sony Music Entertainment international office who commissioned the album, and in countries like Japan and Australia where it was promoted in those markets. However the album and singles failed to attract mainstream success.
Music.
The album features the participation of a number of notable pop music producers and songwriters. They include Nikos Karvelas, Paul Berry, Mark Taylor, Graham Stack, Paul Stanley, Vini Poncia, Steve Torch, Russ Ballard, Tina Shafer, Julian Harris, Danielle Gerber and David Campbell.
Covers.
The album contained three cover versions of tracks originally or later recorded by other artists. "On A Night Like This" was originally recorded by Swedish artist Pandora for her 1999 album "No Regrets" and later recorded by Kylie Minogue in late 2000 for her album "Light Years". "So In Love with Yourself" was originally recorded by Dannii Minogue in 1997 for her album "Girl". I Was Made For Lovin' You was originally recorded by the band Kiss. "No More the Fool" was originally recorded by Elkie Brooks.

Career.
Youth and college.
Cristman graduated from Mills Godwin High School in Richmond, Virginia, where as a senior in 2003 he helped seal a perfect 22–0–0 record for the team on way to an AAA state championship and No. 1 national ranking. He played college soccer at the University of Virginia, where he scored 34 career goals and accumulated 15 assists. During his college years Cristman also played for the Richmond Strikers and Richmond Kickers Future in the USL Premier Development League.
Professional.
Cristman was selected in the fourth round of the 2007 MLS SuperDraft by New England Revolution and signed a developmental contract with the club. He began his debut season as a starter with Pat Noonan out with injury, and later settled into a role as a regular sub and spot starter, appearing in almost every game of the season. His solid play quickly earned him a bump up to the senior roster in midseason.
After the 2008 season, Cristman was traded to Kansas City Wizards for allocation money and a third round 2009 MLS SuperDraft selection. On July 25, 2009 after being plagued by injury for the first few months of the year, he made his debut coming on as a second-half sub in an MLS game against LA Galaxy.

Beagle B.206

The Beagle B.206 is a 1960s British seven-seat twin-engined liaison and communication aircraft built by Beagle Aircraft Limited at Shoreham Airport and Rearsby Aerodrome.
Design and development.
The design of a twin-engined light transport began in 1960 and the prototype registered "G-ARRM" (designated the B.206X) first flew from Shoreham Airport, West Sussex on 15 August 1961. The prototype aircraft was a five-seat all metal low-wing monoplane powered by two Continental flat-six engines. Owned since 1990 by Brooklands Museum and recently restored by volunteers at Shoreham Airport, this historic aeroplane is now on loan to the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust Museum at Farnborough, Hampshire, arriving there by road on 10 December 2011. 
The second prototype (registered "G-ARXM" and designated B.206Y) was slightly larger with a larger span wing and seating for seven. Two aircraft were built for evaluation by the Ministry of Aviation at Boscombe Down and an order for twenty aircraft for the Royal Air Force followed. The RAF aircraft were designated Basset CC.1 and were built at Rearsby Aerodrome, Leicestershire. 
A Series 2 aircraft (a converted Series 1, "G-ASMK") with 340 hp Continental turbocharged engines first flew on 23 June 1965. The production Series 2 (initially known as the B.206S) was also fitted with a large freight door. The aircraft was soon in demand with air taxi companies and as a light transport for companies. Three aircraft were delivered to the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Australia.
A Series 3 was developed with a raised rear fuselage to carry 10-passengers but only two were converted from Series 2 airframes (G-35-28 c/n B.074 and G-AWLN, c/n B.080) and the former was later re-converted back to a Series 2. When the company needed the room at Rearsby to build the Beagle Pup, production of the B.206 ended with the 80th aircraft.
Operational history.
A competition was held at RAF Northolt in March 1963 between the B.206 and the de Havilland Devon for an aircraft to replace the Avro Anson, resulting in 20 Bassets being ordered for the RAF.
The first delivery to RAF communications squadrons was made in May 1965. It was powered by two Rolls-Royce/Continental GIO-470 six cylinder horizontally-opposed engines giving it a maximum speed of 220 mph and a range of 1,645 miles. Up to eight persons could be carried. 
The Northolt aircraft were originally based at RAF Bovingdon near Watford, Hertfordshire with the Southern Communications Squadron until the 'SCS' moved to Northolt and became 207 Squadron on 4 February 1969. Another squadron, the Northern Communications Squadron, operated Bassets from RAF Topcliffe near Thirsk in North Yorkshire, later becoming 26 Squadron at RAF Wyton. Most aircraft were removed from RAF service on 2 May 1974 and sold for civil use. 
The first civil ordered aircraft (a Series 1 registered "G-ASWJ") was delivered in May 1965 to Rolls-Royce Limited at Hucknall. 
An unusual use for one of the first aircraft registered "G-ATHO" which was bought by Maidenhead Organ Studios Limited for transporting electronic organs. Other examples were operated by UK-based air charter firms including Air Kilroe. 
The type was sold to and operated by civilian firms and individuals in several countries including Australia, Brazil and the United States. Bassets were sold after RAF service to Paraguay.

Mitsubishi SUW

The Mitsubishi SUW (Smart Utility Wagon) is a series of concept cars sharing a common design theme, and first exhibited by Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors at the 1999 Frankfurt and Tokyo Motor Shows.
The Smart Utility Wagon theme was introduced late in 1998 as a demonstration of the company's corporate slogan of the time, "Innovation in Motion", which was itself to represent "smart design" and "ecology consciousSpecifically, SUWs shared the company's gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine technology, a taller roofline for easier entry and exit, and interior space competitive with larger vehicles. The three individual vehicles Mitsubishi produced were the SUW Advance, a five door hatchback family car, the SUW Compact a three door hatchback small car, and the SUW Active sport utility vehicle.
SUW Advance.
The SUW Advance hatchback was designed with accommodation for five adults and high fuel economy as its highest priorities. Externally, it measured , wide, and high, while suicide doors at the rear and no central vertical pillar allowed easier entry and egress. The car was powered by a GDI-HEV hybrid electric powertrain; a 1.5 litre internal combustion engine using gasoline direct injection and an array of lithium ion batteries, mated to a continuously variable transmission. With a lightweight body and a drag coefficient of 0.28, Mitsubishi claimed it to be capable of .
SUW Compact.
The SUW Compact was designed for urban environments, so compactness and manoeuvrability were prioritised alongside fuel economy. The Compact was long, wide and high, and it benefited from a turning circle of . The powertrain also utilised GDI technology, this time as a 1.1 litre with "ASG" (Automatic Stop-Go), a system which turns off the engine when it is idling and restarts it on demand. Combined with its drag coefficient of 0.30, the Compact claimed fuel consumption of .
SUW Active.
The SUW Active did not appear alongside its siblings at Frankfurt, debuting instead in Tokyo in October. Another GDI powertrain was used, this time fitted with a turbocharger. The car measured long, wide and high.

Jacques Pâris de Bollardière

Jacques Pâris de Bollardière (16 December 1907, Châteaubriant, Loire-Atlantique – 22 February 1986) was a French Army general, famous for his non-violent positions during the 1960s.
Biography.
Early life.
Bollardière studied at the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr; he graduated in 1930 with the rank of sergeant, for insubordination (Saint-Cyr cadets normally graduate as commissioned officers, with the rank of sous-lieutenant). He was quickly promoted to sous-lieutenant and to lieutenant in 1932.
He joined the French Foreign Legion in February 1935 and was posted to Algeria until 1940.
Second World War.
In February 1940, Bollardière was assigned to the 13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade, and promoted to captain. He took part in the Battles of Narvik, and was back in Brest on the 13th of June. Seeing the debacle of the French armies, he crossed the Channel on a fishing boat and was among the very first to join Charles de Gaulle (the momentous rallying call that founded the Fighting French was broadcast on the 18th of that month); the Vichy regime sentenced him to death. 
Bollardière fought in Gabon, and in Eritrea during the East African Campaign. Leading a 90-man strong party, he managed to seize and occupy an Italian fort in Massawa, taking over 300 prisoners. He was made a Compagnon de la Libération for this action.
Promoted to commandant (Major) in 1941, he took part in the capture of Damascus that summer. The following year, he took part in the Battle of Bir Hakeim, and the First Battle of El Alamein. He was severely wounded by a mine.
In October 1943, he volunteered for Special Forces training and was put on a parachute-training course. On 12 April 1944, Bollardière was parachuted in France to take a command of the maquis in Ardennes, under the "nom de guerre" "Prisme". His maquis units engaged German troops and sustained heavy casualties, but made a successful link with the advancing Allied ground forces. In September 1944, Bollardière returned to England. 
He was then posted to the Airborne Forces and joined the "Red Berets" of the 3e "Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes" (Parachute Light Infantry), which was part of the Special Air Service Brigade. He parachuted into Holland.
Indochina war.
Bollardière was in command of a paratrooper demi-brigade at the outbreak of the First Indochina War. He took part in commando actions in Laos, Cambodia and Tonkin.
Algerian War.
From October 1953, Bollardière taught paratrooper strategy and tactics at the Paris "École de Guerre", the prestigious school for staff officers.
At the outbreak of the Algerian War, in July 1956, Bollardière was put in command of two brigades in the Algerian Atlas Mountains. He was promoted to général de brigade in December, becoming the youngest general of the French army of the time.
In opposition to government policy regarding usage of torture among French units, Bollardière requested to be relieved of command, and returned to France in January 1957. He was sentenced to 60 days of fortress arrest at La Courneuve for publicly supporting Servan-Schreiber. The only military to support him was captain Pierre Dabezies (1925–2002), a left-wing Gaullist who would later lead the 11e Choc elite troop and get close to the socialist Jean-Pierre Chevènement. Bollardière was later assigned to French Equatorial Africa and Germany. 
He resigned from the Army after the Algiers putsch, as he was not able to obtain a command in Algeria.
Retirement and pacifist activism.
Bollardière became a pacifist after a talk by the writer Jean-Marie Muller in Lorient, on 23 October 1970. He was president of the association "Logement et Promotion Sociale" between 1968 and 1978. In July 1973, he was arrested by the French Navy during protests against nuclear trials in Mururoa, along with journalist Brice Lalonde, priest Jean Toulat and Jean-Marie Muller. The Council of Ministers, then headed by Georges Pompidou, imposed him as disciplinary measure a forced pension.
Jacques Paris Bollardière died on 22 February 1986 at his residence Vieux-Talhouët and was buried in Vannes, Brittany.

Atlanta Union Station (1930)

The Union Station built in 1930 in Atlanta was the smaller of two principal train stations in downtown, Terminal Station being the other. It was the third "union station" or "union depot" (usage varied in the 19th century), succeeding the 1853 station, burned in the Battle of Atlanta, and the 1871 station.
The station was located over the tracks between Forsyth and Spring Streets, 3 blocks west and 1 block south of the predecessor union stations. The site is the block immediately west of Five Points MARTA station.
Opening in 1930, the third Union Station served the Georgia Railroad, Atlantic Coast Line (previously the Atlanta, Birmingham and Coast Railroad), and Louisville and Nashville (previously the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway). It replaced earlier stations on the same site.
After the tenant railroads of Union Station had discontinued all their passenger trains—the last such train operated on April 30, 1971, the day before Amtrak came into existence—the station was razed in 1972. Remnants of the platform may be seen behind the "Atlanta Journal Constitution" building although construction of Underground Atlanta and MARTA largely obliterated the site.

<doc id="9920876" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9920876" title="Undefined (mathematics)">
Undefined (mathematics)

In mathematics, the word undefined has several different meanings, depending on the context.
Undefined terms in geometry.
In ancient times, geometers attempted to define every term. For example, Euclid defined a point as "that which has no part". In modern times, mathematicians recognized that attempting to define every word inevitably led to circular definitions, and therefore left some terms, "point" for example, as undefined (see primitive notion).
Undefined operations in arithmetic.
The reasoning behind leaving division by zero undefined is as follows. Division is the inverse of multiplication. If formula_4, then formula_5. But if formula_6, then any multiple of formula_7 is also formula_8, and so if formula_9, no such formula_10 exists. On the other hand, if formula_11 and formula_7 are both zero, then every real number formula_10 satisfies formula_14. Either way, it is impossible to assign a particular real number to the quotient when the divisor is zero. Therefore, the operation is undefined for zero.
In calculus, formula_15 is sometimes used as a symbol, and is called an indeterminate form, but the symbol does not represent division in the sense the word is used in ordinary arithmetic.
Another common operation that is undefined is that of raising zero to the zero power. On the one hand, if formula_16, then formula_17. On the other hand, if formula_18 is any positive number, formula_19, while if formula_18 is negative, formula_21 implies division by zero, which is undefined. Thus, to make the laws of exponents work in every case where exponents are defined, formula_22 is left undefined. That said, there are branches of higher mathematics where various definitions of zero to the zero power are given (see exponentiation).
Values for which functions are undefined.
The set of numbers for which a function is defined is called the "domain" of the function. If a number is not in the domain of a function, the function is said to be "undefined" for that number. Two common examples are formula_23, which is undefined for formula_24, and formula_25, which is undefined (in the real number system) for negative formula_26.
Notation using ↓ and ↑.
In computability theory, if "f" is a partial function on "S" and "a" is an element of "S", then this is written as "f"("a")↓ and is read as ""f"("a") is "defined"."
If "a" is not in the domain of "f", then this is written as "f"("a")↑ and is read as ""f"("a") is "undefined"".
The symbols of infinity.
In analysis, measure theory, and other mathematical disciplines, the symbol formula_27 is frequently used to denote an infinite pseudo-number in real analysis, along with its negative, formula_28. The symbol has no well-defined meaning by itself, but an expression like formula_29 is shorthand for a divergent sequence, which at some point is eventually larger than any given real number.
Performing standard arithmetic operations with the symbols formula_30 is undefined. Some extensions, though, define the following conventions of addition and multiplication:
No sensible extension of addition and multiplication with formula_27 exist in the following cases:
See extended real number line for more information.
Singularities in complex analysis.
In complex analysis, a point formula_41 where a holomorphic function is undefined is called a singularity. One distinguishes between removable singularities (the function can be extended holomorphically to formula_42, poles (the function can be extended meromorphically to formula_42), and essential singularities, where no meromorphic extension to formula_42 exists.

Prinzhorn Dance School

Prinzhorn Dance School consists of two artists, Tobin Prinz and Suzi Horn.
They have taken their name from Dr Hans Prinzhorn, who collected art by mentally ill patients under his care.
Biography.
In 2006 Prinz and Horn signed a recording contract with the New York record label DFA Records. Their debut release for the label was a self recorded and self produced 7-inch single featuring the tracks "You Are The Space Invader" and "Eat, Sleep".
Live performances.
They have thus far completed UK and European tour dates. The debut album was toured with a three-piece line-up (with the addition of a drummer). However, in August 2008 they headlined the Experimental Circle Tent at Offset Festival bringing the event to a close as a 2-piece (using a specially modified shared drumkit), the first time they have performed without a separate drummer. They retained this live formation for recent shows in Luxembourg, Istanbul, Bucharest and Lausanne.
Recycling clause.
Negotiations with EMI (who licensed the debut album in the UK) were protracted while the band insisted upon the inclusion of special recycling clauses, ensuring that all their record sleeves, CD sleeves and promotional material be produced using recycled materials. All releases to date have used recycled paperstock.
In popular media.
In 2008 their song "You Are The Space Invader" was used as the soundtrack to the HBO Cinemax trailer.
In 2007 The Sunday Telegraph included Prinzhorn Dance School's debut album in a "best 120 albums of all time" list.
In 2010 a poster of the Prinzhorn Dance School album can been seen in the movie Greenberg. DFA Records boss James Murphy was responsible for the soundtrack.

Bubbly Creek

Bubbly Creek is the nickname given to the South Fork of the Chicago River's South Branch, which runs entirely within the city of Chicago, Illinois, US. It marks the boundary between the Bridgeport and McKinley Park community areas of the city. The creek derives its name from the gases bubbling out of the riverbed from the decomposition of blood and entrails dumped into the river in the early 20th century by the local meatpacking businesses surrounding the Union Stock Yards directly south of the creek's endpoint at Pershing Road. It was brought to notoriety by Upton Sinclair in his exposé on the American meat packing industry entitled "The Jungle".
History.
The area surrounding Bubbly Creek was originally a wetland; during the 19th century, channels were dredged to increase the rate of flow into the Chicago River and dry out the area to increase the amount of habitable land in the fast-growing city. The South Fork became an open sewer for the local stockyards, especially the Union Stock Yards. Meatpackers dumped waste, such as blood and entrails, into the nearest river. The creek received so much blood and offal that it began to bubble methane and hydrogen sulfide gas from the products of decomposition.
In 1906, author Upton Sinclair wrote "The Jungle", an unflattering portrait of America's meat packing industry. In it, he reported on the state of Bubbly Creek, writing that:
Present situation.
Two heavily polluted streams that joined to create the South Fork were later filled in, but their courses can still be seen today in the configuration of streets and railroad tracks in the area.
The area has been increasingly occupied by residential development such as Bridgeport Village; a program to oxygenate the creek by continuously injecting compressed air into the water has met with limited success; the creek's odor is much reduced, and some fish and vegetation have returned in recent decades. Areas near the creek have been designated for recreational uses including parks, and developers and the city agreed on a setback to allow for remediation. However, during heavy rains, millions of gallons of wastewater continue to be dumped into the stagnant creek by the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.
As of 2007, the City of Chicago and the Army Corps of Engineers were considering a $2.65 million feasibility study to look at restoration options, which would have implications for the remainder of the Chicago River system due to the unusual challenges of Bubbly Creek. The creek's waters are largely stagnant, having little gravitational flow; the study will look into possibilities including a meandering stream amid a wetland to restore an oxygenated system.

B'Day Anthology Video Album

"B'Day Anthology Video Album" is the first video album by American recording artist Beyoncé Knowles. It features thirteen music videos for songs from her second studio album, "B'Day" (2006) and its deluxe re-release (2007). It was released by Columbia Records exclusively through Wal-Mart stores on April 3, 2007 alongside the deluxe album, but was later serviced to other retailers. Knowles shot nine videos for the album, and four pre-filmed videos were also included. "B'Day Anthology Video Album" has been certified double-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Outside of North America, the album featured as a bonus disc to the "B'Day Deluxe Edition". The "Still in Love (Kissing You)" video was the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit, therefore only initial pressings of the album contain its video.
Background.
Knowles said that she filmed "B'Day Anthology Video Album" because she "always wanted to do a video album" so that her fans would not have to log on to YouTube to watch her music videos, but could instead play them via DVD. Knowles knew what the videos' choreography would be before the filming began. She also planned her hairstyles, outfits and make-up. Knowles wanted each video to look different, and therefore she used different film techniques, fashion and styling. "B'Day Anthology Video Album" contains thirteen music videos and behind the scenes footage. The videos for "Déjà Vu", "Ring the Alarm", "Irreplaceable" and "Listen" had been shot prior to the album's filming. The other nine videos were filmed in a two-week period. "B'Day Anthology Video Album" contains music videos for all of the songs from the standard issue of "B'Day" except for "Resentment". It also includes videos for "Beautiful Liar", "Flaws and All" and "Still in Love (Kissing You)", which featured only on the deluxe edition. According to "Vibe", the thirteen videos on "B'Day Anthology Video Album" gave Knowles the record of the most music videos released in a twelve-month period.
Release and reception.
"B'Day Anthology Video Album" was released by Columbia Records exclusively through Wal-Mart on April 3, 2007, the same day that the "B'Day Deluxe Edition" was released. The video album was made available to other retailers on June 19, 2007. Outside of North America, the video album was featured as the second disc on the deluxe edition of "B'Day" albeit without the behind-the-scenes footage. "Irreemplazable", an EP featuring Spanish-language recordings, was included as the bonus disc in the United States. Prior to its release, copies of the videos were ripped from an advance album and leaked onto the internet in MP4 form. Knowles promoted the album by appearing on television shows "Today" and "The Early Show", while television channel VH1 Soul aired several of its videos. "B'Day Anthology Video Album" debuted at number twenty-four on the US Top Music Videos chart of April 28, 2007, and has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting the shipment of 200,000 copies. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized the music videos for the songs on "B'Day Anthology Video Album", writing that "none of them are anything special, though most will please narrow-minded fans".
Copyright infringement lawsuit.
Knowles covered Des'ree's song "Kissing You" for the deluxe edition of "B'Day" and retitled it "Still in Love (Kissing You)". She filmed a video of the song for "B'Day Anthology Video Album"; however one of the conditions set out by Des'ree's publishers, the Royalty Network, was that Knowles did not release the song in video form. The Royalty Network filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the involved parties seeking US$150,000 in damages. Infringing copies of "B'Day Anthology Video Album" were recalled in April 2007, and in October 2007 the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice. Later copies of the album did not contain "Still in Love (Kissing You)".

Antanas Kavaliauskas

Antanas Kavaliauskas (born September 19, 1984) is a Lithuanian professional basketball player who plays for Lietuvos Rytas of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LBL). He is also a former Texas A&M University college basketball player.
Early years.
Antanas Kavaliauskas was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, to Birutė Kavaliauskienė. After his parents divorced when he was eleven, Kavaliauskas lived with his mother, grandmother, and younger sister Eglė in a small apartment in Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania. His mother is a former volleyball player who spent years working as a hairdresser before supporting her family with a job as a security guard. When Lithuania declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Birutė Kavaliauskienė sent her son away for several weeks to protect him from the Soviet troops who were occupying the city. Once the situation became safer, Antanas returned home, but remembers seeing Soviet troops for several more months before they finally left the country.
Despite the fact that he was neither a very good student nor an exceptional basketball player (averaging only 5 minutes per game for his club team), Kavaliauskas's height () brought him to the attention of a scout, who recommended him to the coach of the basketball team at Barton County Community College in Great Bend, Kansas, United States.
Barton County Community College.
Kavaliauskas entered the U.S. on September 4, 2003 knowing only three words of English: Yes, no, and okay. A fellow international teammate, Brazilian J. P. Batista, became Kavaliauskas's mentor. Within three months Kavaliauskas was fluent in English, his fourth language (after Lithuanian, German, and Russian). During his first year at school he gained 45 pounds eating McDonald's double cheeseburgers, bringing his weight to a more athletic 245 pounds.
In his second year at the school, he earned first-team all-region and all-conference honors for averaging 17.6 points per game. He led the region in rebounds (10 per game), and offensive rebounding (3.9 per game). In his sophomore season he completed 50.9 percent of his attempts from the field, leading his team and ranking fifth in the region, and also led the team in blocked shots (29). His career field goal percentage (58) ranks second in the history of Barton County Community College.
After being recruited by South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia Tech, Kavaliauskas chose to attend Texas A&M University to play under coach Billy Gillispie. Gillispie had originally intended to recruit another player on the Barton County team, but after watching several practices he was very impressed with the mobility of such a large man as Kavaliauskas.
Lithuanian junior national team.
Before joining the Aggies for the 2005–2006 season, Kavaliauskas spent the summer playing with the Lithuanian junior national team. He led the team to the gold medal at the 2005 FIBA Under-21 World Championship in Argentina, scoring nine points with five rebounds in a close 65–63 victory over Greece in the championship game. He also participated in the Lithuanian Junior National Team's bronze medal run at the Global Games in Dallas, Texas, in which their only loss was to Team USA. In the bronze medal game, Kavaliauskas scored 22 points with seven rebounds.
Texas A&M University.
Junior year (2005–2006).
In his first 21 games with Texas A&M, Kavaliauskas averaged only 5.4 points, and his team had compiled only a 4–6 record in the Big 12. Over the last ten games, however, he improved to an average of 8.6 points per game. Overall, Kavaliauskas averaged 6.5 points and 3.4 rebounds per game and was the team leader in field goal percentage (.584). Twice scoring a career-high fifteen points, against Iowa State and Savannah State, Kavaliauskas also posted a career-high nine rebounds against Colorado in the Big 12 Tournament. He also earned a spot on the media Big 12 All-Newcomer Team. He played in 30 games during the season,
As their record improved throughout the second half of the season, the Aggies earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987. During the tournament, Kavaliauskas averaged 10.5 points and 4.0 rebounds. After winning their first round match-up against Syracuse, the Aggies appeared poised to reach the Sweet 16 when, with 18 seconds left in their second-round game against LSU, teammate Acie Law hit a jumper, giving the Aggies a 57–55 lead. The dream was dashed fifteen seconds later, however, when Darrell Mitchell completed a three-point shot for LSU over the head of Kavaliauskas. Convinced that he was the reason the team lost, Kavaliauskas found a photo of Mitchell's game-winning shot and hung it in his locker as a daily reminder of what he needs to work on.
Senior year (2006–2007).
Shortly after beginning play in the 2006–2007 season, the Aggies reached Number 6 in the rankings, the highest rank the school had ever achieved. The team had their best start since opening 16–2 in the 1959–1960 season, as well as their best conference opening since the inception of the Big 12.
In a historic moment on February 3, 2007, the Aggies became the first Big 12 South team (in 32 attempts) to ever beat the then-Number 6 Kansas Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse. Less than two days later the team beat then-Number 25 Texas, their twenty-first straight home win, making them the sole leader of the Big 12.
After a "Dallas Morning News" article profiled Kavaliauskas, mentioning that he had only seen his mother twice since he moved to the USA, many Texas A&M fans inquired about raising money to reunite the family temporarily. Texas A&M discovered that the NCAA-financed Student-Athlete Opportunity Fund could be used, and paid for Birute Kavaliauskiene to travel to the US for the first time to see her son play in his last home game for A&M. In the Aggies' 94–78 win over Missouri, Kavaliauskas, whose mother traveled all the way from Lithuania to see him play, scored a career-high 26 points on 11-of-12 shooting. The win assured the Aggies of a second-place finish in the Big 12 regular season, the highest the team has ever finished in this conference.
For the season Kavaliauskas ranks first in the Big 12 in field goal percentage (58.0). He has averaged 12.5 points per game, and was awarded second-team All Big 12 honors.
Although the Aggies were the number two seed for the Big 12 Conference Tournament, they played poorly in their first game in the quarterfinals of the tournament and were eliminated in a loss to Oklahoma State.
On Selection Sunday, however, the Aggies were rewarded for their regular-season play with a Number 3 seed in the South region of the 2007 NCAA Tournament. The Aggies won their first-round game against Penn to advance to the second round of the tournament. The team's 72–69 victory over Louisville earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 1980.
Professional career.
In July 2011 he signed a one-year contract with BK VEF Rīga in Latvia.

County Route 106 (Rockland County, New York)

County Route 106 (CR 106) is a east–west county route in Rockland County, New York, in the United States. It serves as an eastward continuation of the like-numbered CR 106 in Orange County, extending from the Orange County line to U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) and US 202 in Stony Point via Harriman State Park. CR 106 intersects with several county highways in Rockland County along the way. The route is only one of two in Rockland County to keep its numbering from Orange County, with the other being CR 72. CR 106 had one spur route, CR 106A, which was recently decommissioned.
The route was originally designated County Highway 416 in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1930, it became the easternmost part of New York State Route 210 (NY 210), a state highway continuing westward into Orange County. In 1982, NY 210 was truncated to end in Greenwood Lake, and its former routing east of NY 17 was replaced by CR 106 in Orange and Rockland counties.
Route description.
CR 106 begins at the Orange County line in Harriman State Park as a continuation of that county's CR 106. The route is only one of two county routes that have the same number in both Rockland and Orange counties; the other is CR 72.
CR 106 proceeds east from here providing a border between Harriman State Park (to the west) and Bear Mountain State Park (to the east). It then intersects Lake Welch Parkway, a seasonal road which provides a route to Lake Welch Beach on the northern side of the lake. Then, CR 106 splits Lake Welch in two different locations on the southern side of the lake. CR 106 then begins its trek out of Harriman State Park and into the town of Stony Point.
Immediately after entering Stony Point, CR 106 intersects CR 98 where CR 106 makes a left turn. CR 106 then proceeds east toward its intersection with the Palisades Parkway. This is at exit 15 and is the last residential exit northbound on the PIP, with everything north of this point being exits within Harriman and Bear Mountain. 
Just after its intersection with the PIP, the road intersects two former Rockland County Routes (CR 106A & CR 69). Also, at this point CR 106 enters the village limits of Stony Point, and becomes a , highway with extra lanes in some places. The highway intersects CR 108, CR 47, and CR 33 as Central Drive. CR 106 comes to an end shortly after these intersections at US 9W and US 202 in downtown Stony Point, about a mile west from the Hudson River and the Stony Point Marina.
History.
CR 106 originated in 1824, when the road was chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at a fork in the road. At the fork, part of the road became NY 210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road became known as the Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway 416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY 17A.
The responsibility for maintaining NY 210 was turned over the county in 1982. The road was replaced with CR 106.
CR 106A.
CR 106A was a spur which began at CR 106 and ended at a dead end near CR 69 in Stony Point.

"B'z" is the first album for the Japanese rock duo B'z. It was released on September 21, 1988, and reached #47 on the Japanese charts. The album sold 3,790 copies in its first week and eventually sold 338,360 in total.
The band did not tour in support of the album, because its nine songs were all the material they had at the time, and they felt it would not be a proper show with just 40 minutes of material. Unlike the hard-rocking music that most associate with B'z, the album was very much a product of its times, with synthesizers and samplers sharing equal time with Tak's guitar.

<doc id="9921166" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9921166" title="Bali people (Nigeria)">
Bali people (Nigeria)

The Bali people (also known as Bibaali, Maya, Ibaale, Abaali, Ibaale or Ibaali) are the communities, numbering 2,000 people, that settled the villages of Farabaune, Tashan Gurgu, Geidam/Tamgum, Tagombali Center, Duwo, Tamwa, Badan, Kwafara, Gidan-Rimi, Tamshe, Bali, and Bomni, located on Numan-Jalingo Highway about 20 km from Numan. Others who settled in the interior are: Janawuri, Salem (Babgye), Tagombali Dutse, Tangshi, Guri, Guri Kasuwa, Dingle, Kwabak, and Ubgo (Dingle Dutse) who speak the Bali language. Presently, Bali people are found in Demsa, Numan, Mayo Belwa Local Government areas of Adamawa State and Lau Local Government area of Taraba State. Majority of the people are agriculturalist, though there are traders, herders and civil servants among them.
History.
Like any other ethnic groups in Nigeria, the Bali claims that they entered the Nigeria region from the east. The Bali, for example claim that they entered the Nigerian region from the Republic of Congo and through gradual process; they came and settled in their present geographical location. The Kpasham and Bomni denied any knowledge of distance movement. They claim that they came from Bachama land, probably from Lamurde to the area they are now occupying. The evidence points to Republic of Congo as their original homeland.
It is not known when the people left their original settlement. Probably, the people must have left their original settlement in the 17th century by which time there was population movement in the whole of the West, East and Central Africa as a result of famine, fracidal wars and chieftaincy tussle. The Bali might have formed part of the population that migrated to the Lake Chad basin area and, later to the Upper Benue Valley. Before the declaration of the Jihad in Fombina, in 1809, Bali had already settled in their various communities and has developed village governments or better still, community governments, independent of each other.
Apart from these community governments set up by the Bali, the people also had a well-defined social and economic system which rendered their societies stable. For example, one aspect of the social life of the people is that the Bali had great respect for life. In fact, the spilling of human blood was seen as offensive to Kpan Biswi (Kpan Luh or Luwe, among the Yotti and Kpasham respectively). Most Bali believed that it was Kpan Biswi that guide and sustain their livelihood. To the Bali, therefore, life was very sacred. The birth of a child was greeted with joy not only by the parents but also by the community as a whole. The growth and development of such a child was watched carefully by the entire community.
He was trained not only by his parents and relatives alone but by the community as a whole. This made Bali child useful member of his society.
Similarly, the death of a member was mourned by all and was seen as a great loss to the entire Bali Community. In short, there was social cohesion among the Bali people before the advert of Colonialism. For instance, an attack on any of the Bali Village by the enemy was seen as an attack on all. Besides, individual farmers or other hunters assisted their colleagues in time of need, especially through communal work (Gaya in Hausa). To put it in another way, during pre-colonial period, Bali Society was quite peaceful and people were hardworking. Their quarrels were settled among them peacefully, although on rare occasions, they resort to skirmishes.
During the first decade of the 19th century, Bali Land started to experience some political, economic and social disequilibrium. The declaration of the Jihad in Fombina in 1809 by, Modibbo Adama affected not only the Bali but the whole of the Upper Benue Region. The Jihadists attempted to overrun the whole of Bali land but without success. However, one devastating impact of this Jihad on the people is that there were population movements throughout Bali land. In the process, many of the Bali lost their children, their relatives, friends and possessions to the Jihadists. Even before the declaration of the Jihad by Moddibo Lawan on Bali people, Baliland had been under constant threats from Fulani and Bachama slave raiders.
The threats posed to the Bali by the slave raiders and the menace of the Jihadists, led to restriction of Bali social, economic and political activities. Consequently, poverty gradually started to gain inroad into the society. A missionary, Ernest Engskor who visited Bali village in the early 1930S had this to bay:
Bali appeared to us to be one of the most wretched, primitive and poverty stricken of African villages, enslaved as the people were by ancient tradition and fear of evil spirit. Our had been on exceptional and unique experience for it was almost as though these people had awakened from their sleeping beauty enhancement to discover the great world beyond their isolated society (Enskor, 1983:179). 
The Bali was gradually tackling the problems of slave raiders and Fulbe Jihadists, when British colonial masters extended their activities to Bali land. Eventually the people were conquered and brought under the British colonial administration in 1903.
In 1903 to 1912, the whole area South of Numan Town was regarded as “closed territory”. It was not until after 1912 that Bali land, including those living in Mayo-Belwa and Lau was opened to Christian missionaries.
By the 1940s, colonialism and Christianity were deeply noted in Bali villages. Indeed, while the Christian missions, especially the United Sudan Mission (SUM) were busy softening the minds of the people they saw as “uncivilized”, the British Colonial Masters were taking their resources away for the development of their home countries. The result is that Bali was left to face acute starvation and hunger. In this way, colonialism continued to destroy Bali economy, technology and self-reliant development just as the slave raiders and Jihadists had done.
This was how the whole of Baliland became a British possession at the beginning of the 20th Century like any other ethnic nationality in Nigeria. Indeed, slave trade and colonialism were the major forces that set back Bali development. The slave raiders dominated Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali resources.
Throughout colonial period, the Bali struggled to free themselves from colonial domination. In 1913, for example, one of the Bali men short and wounded a British Touring Officer who had gone to Bali for head account. In reprisal, Bali village was attacked and destroyed by the British punitive expedition. It took the people years to build their village. But this did not stop the people from opposing the British actively or passively. On 1 October 1960, however, the Bali people together with the rest of the ethnic groups in the country gained political independence from Britain.

The Elcho Shield is an annual match rifle competition between national teams of eight from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. The trophy holder is able to choose the venue of the competition, however, since the NRA's move to Surrey from Wimbledon in the 19th century, the competition has been held at Bisley Ranges, Surrey, England. Each shooter fires fifteen shots at , , and with, unusually for a shooting discipline, no "sighting" or practice shots. The shooters may be coached which allows other team members to judge and make necessary adjustments to the shooter's sights. The rules allow each team two hours at each range to fire all their shots. The match is most regularly held following the national championships in July each year.
The first match, on Wednesday July 9th 1862, was held over , and solely between Scotland and England. In the event England won by 166 marks. Scotland won the trophy for the first time in 1864 and Ireland joined the fray in 1865.
The trophy is large and distinctive, known as the Elcho Shield, and is made from a sheet of iron decorated with repousse scenes to a design by the artist G. F. Watts. It was presented to the National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom by its founder and president, Lord Elcho (Francis Richard Charteris, 10th Earl of Wemyss and 6th Earl of March, b. 1818, d. 1914).
The current holder of the trophy is England (2013).

81st (West Africa) Division

The 81st (West Africa) Division was formed under British control during World War II. It took part in the Burma Campaign.
History.
The inspiration for the division's formation came from General George Giffard, commander of the British Army's West Africa Command, who subsequently commanded India Command's Eastern Army, facing the Japanese army on the frontier between India and Burma. Giffard had wide experience with African troops, and was eager for them to participate in the war.
The framework around which the division was formed was the Royal West African Frontier Force. One of the brigades (the 3rd West African) and several of the supporting units which formed the division had already seen action with the 11th (African) Division, against the Italians in East Africa.
The division was established as the 1st (West Africa) Division on 1 March, 1943. Three days later it was renamed the 81st (West Africa) Division, taking the next vacant number in the list of British infantry divisions. The division's badge was a spider, in black on a yellow circular background. This spider was a reference to Ananse, a cunning character in Ashanti mythology, and drawn so that when a soldier raised his weapon to fire, the spider would appear to be going forwards.
The division arrived in India on 14 August, 1943. The movement of the 5th (West Africa) Brigade was delayed, however, after the troopship which was to carry it was lost in the German attack on Convoy Faith off Portugal on the night of 11/12 July 1943. The 3rd (West Africa) Brigade was detached to the Chindits, and was intended to garrison jungle bases for the raiding columns. The remainder of the division took part in the second Arakan campaign from February to May, 1944, operating in the Kaladan Valley on the flank of Indian XV Corps.
In late March, substantial Japanese reinforcements (with some troops from the Indian National Army outflanked the division and forced it to retreat over a range of hills out of the Kaladan valley into that of the Kalapanzin.
In August, the division re-entered the Kaladan valley, forcing the Japanese and Indian National Army to abandon Mowdok, a few miles east of the Indian / Burmese frontier. The division then advanced down the valley once again, reaching Myohaung near the mouth of the river on 28 January 1945.
The division was withdrawn to India to rest on 22 April, 1945. On 31 August, it was returned to West Africa and disbanded.
Character and organisation.
The division was originally intended to operate on a pack basis, with porters carrying all equipment and supplies. Lieutenant General William Slim, then commanding XV Corps, commented on first inspecting units of the division in late 1943:
Their discipline and smartness were impressive, and they were more obviously at home in the jungle than any troops I had yet seen... I was at once struck by two things. First, by the horde of unarmed porters who were needed to carry supplies, ammunition, baggage and the heavier weapons, and secondly by the large number of white men in a unit, fifty or sixty to a battalion. Accustomed as I was to Indian battalions in the field with usually only seven or eight Europeans, it struck me as an unnecessarily generous supply.

Known for his work about pulp fiction, he has published over 200 issues of fanzines on the topic since 1960 under the titles "ERB-dom", "The Fantasy Collector" and "Pulpdom". He has also written and taught Western history.
Biography.
Early life.
Cazedessus was born December 8, 1938 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the only child of engineer Camille Cazedessus. He graduated from Baton Rouge High School in 1957 and Spring Hill College, where he graduated in 1961. He also attended Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La, and New Mexico Highlands College in Las Vegas, New Mexico, and Ft. Lewis College, in each case studying American and South West history.
Career.
Organized and led the first teenage Rock and Roll band in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in the Fall of 1956: "The Dots." Cazedessus was lead singer and rhythm guitar until the Fall of 1957, when he relinquished the band to Lenny Capella to go to Spring Hill College, Mobile, Alabama.
Later, as fans of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Cazedessus and Alfred Guillory, Jr. launched the fanzine "ERB-dom" in May 1960. Following Guillory's death the following year, Caz became the magazine's sole editor and publisher. "ERB-dom" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Fanzine in 1964 and 1966, winning the award in 1966. "ERB-dom" went monthly in January 1970, with full color covers. In 1974 it returned to less frequent publication, and the "final" issue was No. 89, November, 1976. "ERB-dom" was revived as part of The Fantastic Collector in December 1993. In December, 1988 Caz had revived The Fantasy Collector (61 issues), and in January 1997 changed the name to Pulpdom, which continued for 75 issues, the last in August 2013. All these issues of The Fantasy Collector and Pulpdom contain illustrated articles on pulp magazines, reviews of and fiction by popular authors of the early 20th century. Pulpdom Online was inaugurated in December of that year and continues today as part of Pulpdom.com.
During the 1960s and 1970s, Cazedessus published books as Opar Press. After living in Taos, New Mexico, during the 1980s, he began publishing books as Rendezvous Books. He continues to publish and write while living in Chimney Rock, Colorado.
Cazedessus has written several books about Kit Carson.
In May, 2010 Caz's old band, "The Dots," was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame by the State of Louisiana, authorized by the governor, Bobby Jindal.

Lakeville Elementary School

Lakeville Elementary School (commonly Lakeville School) is an American elementary school that was named a 2009 Blue Ribbon School of Excellence, the US Department of Education's highest award. It is located in The Village of Lake Success (within the Town of Great Neck), serving students in grades 1 through 5 as well as kindergarten. Kindergarten classes are held at the Parkville School, which is located in the nearby town of New Hyde Park.
Lakeville School is one of four elementary schools in the Great Neck School District, which includes Saddle Rock Elementary School, John F. Kennedy Elementary School and E.M. Baker Elementary School. Lakeville School offers its 856 students English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies, Special Area Programs, Intervention Programs, Enrichment Courses, Homework Center, Tutoring, and Paraprofessionals.
Academics.
English Language Arts.
Language arts—reading, writing, listening, and speaking for information, understanding, literary response, critical analysis, and social interaction---are central to the total elementary curriculum.
In the primary grades (first through second), the focus is on developing literacy skills integrated with the study of social studies, science, mathematics, and technology. 
Language arts are also stressed in the intermediate grades (third through fifth). Reading becomes more refined and writing is integrated into all curriculum areas through the use of expository essays, research reports, literature responses, journals, and logs.
Mathematics.
Interdisciplinary applications in mathematics include the use of children's literature, written communication to express mathematical thinking and problem solving, and appropriate computer software. Children learn how to interpret graphs and charts, collect and analyze data, and draw conclusions.
Social Studies.
The social studies curriculum includes geography, history, map studies, economics, civics, citizenship, and government. It begins in the primary grades with themes that concentrate on the family, school, and community, and expands in the intermediate grades to include Long Island, New York State, the United States, and selected world communities, all of which are explored culturally, politically, geographically, and historically.
Special Area Programs.
Specialists work with children and classroom teachers to enhance and enrich the elementary program in science, reading, gifted, computer, art, music, physical education, technology, and library/media. 
Science Consultants work directly with students in a laboratory setting to provide scheduled "hands-on" science experiences, focusing on the development of inquiry and problem-solving skills. The classroom teachers reinforce and expand knowledge of this content area in their ongoing programs.
Reading Resource Teachers work with students, classroom teachers, and administrators to help ensure each child's progress in reading.
Teachers of the Gifted work with third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade children whose needs cannot be entirely met in the regular classroom. Special projects and advanced studies, as well as independent research, are developed to meet these children's needs and interests. In addition, teachers of the gifted serve as consultants and provide additional resources to the classroom teachers in grades K-5. 
Computer Teachers implement a sequential curriculum in computer skills and technology applications for students in grades K-5. Staff developers provide classroom teachers with training to support the integration of technology with classroom instruction. Lakeville School is equipped with a Computer Instructional Center and either an additional lab or a wireless laptop cart for whole-class computer activities. In addition, to enhance and support instruction in all subject areas, grades 1-5 classrooms are equipped with four computers and laptop; kindergarten classrooms have three computers. 
Art, Music, Physical Education, and Technology Specialists support the elementary program and expand the children's horizons for lifelong learning. They work with all classes, beginning in kindergarten. A spiraling curriculum in each of these areas addresses skills, creative expression, and aesthetic appreciation. 
Library/Media Specialists teach elementary children to become effective users of information. They encourage the cultivation of literature apprection, and support and enrich the educational program. Children are taught research skills and learn to access information from a variety of print and technology sources, such as reference CDs and multimedia encyclopedias. The library/media specialists meet with classroom teachers to plan mutually supportive activities and projects.
Intervention Programs.
A team of teachers provides intervention services for children with special needs, working with them individually and in small groups. There is close articulation between the teachers who provide academic intervention and the classroom teachers. 
Speech Teachers work with small groups of identified children to develop their oral communication skills.
Math Lab Teachers provide additional support for children having difficulty with computation or problem-solving, to help ensure their success in the classroom. 
Reading Teachers meet with small groups of children in grades 1-5, to reinforce the development of their reading and writing skills. This supplements the reading program provided in the classroom.
Reading Recovery Teachers meet with individual, at-risk first-graders, five times a week, for approximately 20 weeks, to provide intensive early intervention. Children are taught strategies for decoding and comprehension, as well as techniques for becoming independent readers. 
ESL (English as a Second Language) Teachers work with children of limited English proficiency to develop their language skills. These teachers also serve as consultants to the classroom teachers.
Enrichment Courses.
Classroom and special-area teachers offer enrichment courses before and after school for children who elect additional studies and challenges. Areas covered include advanced computer programming, drama, foreign language, language development, literature, and math and science investigation.
Homework Center.
Homework Center provide an after-school program for children in the intermediate grades. Certified teachers, teacher assistants, and volunteers assist students with homework or special projects assigned by their classroom teachers.
Tutoring.
Small-group tutoring is also provided before and after school for students in the intermediate grades who are at risk with regard to the New York State Assessments in English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies.
Paraprofessionals.
Teaching Assistants (instructional paraprofessionals) help in the library, computer, and instructional programs. 
Non-instructional Paraprofessionals provide supervision and ensure the welfare and safety of children before school and during their lunch and recess periods.
Special education.
Lakeville School is a comprehensive elementary school. Therefore, it is required to meet the needs of students who are at-risk of failing academically. These programs listed below are designed for them. Some students who are at-risk may be asked to leave Lakeville School to attend a special education school, special class operated by another school district or other in-district special education program. Parents are urged to look at these programs to determine if these are in the best interest of their child. If Lakeville School fails in providing the best interest for the child, parents are urged to use their "due process procedures" to challenge the school for not providing a "Free Appropriate Public Education" that is guaranteed by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).
The Lakeville Elementary School has 103 classified students, with consultant teacher, collaborative support, resource room and special classes. The Parkville Kindergarten Program (actually Lakeville's kindergarten population) has 18 classified children, and offers collaborative support and special classes.
Demographics.
The student body in the 2007-2008 school year consisted of:

Artificial Intelligence (John Cale album)

Artificial Intelligence is a 1985 album by John Cale. It was originally titled "Black Rose", the title and some changes to the tracks delayed the album being released for five weeks, early test pressings have the title "Black Rose". Having produced Nico's "Camera Obscura", Cale recorded this album at Strongroom Studios with her backing band, The Faction, with the addition of a couple of additional musicians. Following the chaotic period during which the album (and the previous two) were recorded, John and Risé's daughter Eden was born, which promptly caused Cale to kick his addictions to alcohol and cocaine, and to temporarily abandon rock/pop records and band performances in favor of other projects (until 1996's Walking on Locusts).

Monadnock Regional High School

Monadnock Regional High School is a public school in Swanzey, New Hampshire. The school serves six towns in the Monadnock region, including Fitzwilliam, Gilsum, Richmond, Roxbury, Swanzey, and Troy. Monadnock was established in 1962 when the district was founded, and named after a nearby landmark, Mount Monadnock.
Scheduling.
Until the fall of 2006, the high school operated on a 7-period schedule, with the fifth period divided into three 25-minute lunches. Until 2013, the school schedule consisted of eight, 47 minute long periods. In 2013 the school switched to a rotating block schedule with 5 blocks and an advisory period. The first and last blocks (A and E) meet every day for 50 minutes, as does the 45 minute advisory block. Blocks B and C are 75 minutes long, and Block D is 108 minutes (75 min. class, 27 min lunch). Block B, C, and D classes rotate on a 5 period rotation, 3 classes meeting per day. This allows the school to effectively offer 7 periods every semester even though only 5 are offered on any given day. There are three lunches; one lunch before Block D class, one halfway through Block D class, and one after Block D class. School days run from 7:30 AM to 2:30 PM. On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, students are allowed to stay after and ride "late buses" to their homes.
Middle school.
The middle school is no longer considered separate from the high school. The middle school had adapted to using the high school bell, meaning they ran on the same schedule, but even though the high school schedule has changed, the middle school's remains the same. They use a rotating block schedule with 7 blocks, 45 minutes each. There are two lunches, one for 8th grade and one for 7th, and each grade has an advisory class when the other is having lunch. School days run from 7:30 AM to 2:30 PM. The middle school operate in the same building as the high school and share many facilities, including the gymnasium, the library, the auditorium and various specialized classrooms such as the woodshop, art rooms, and tech labs (VEX Classes).
Mission statement.
""Monadnock Regional High School strives to engage all students in a quality education that enables them to develop and meet their individual goals and prepares them to lead satisfying, productive lives as global citizens.""

<doc id="9921347" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9921347" title="Pointer aliasing">
Pointer aliasing

In computer programming, aliasing refers to the situation where the same memory location can be accessed using different names.
For instance, if a function takes two pointers codice_1 and codice_2 which have the same value, then the name codice_3. In this case we say the pointers codice_1 and codice_2 alias each other. Note that the concept of pointer aliasing is not very well-defined – two pointers codice_1 and codice_2 may or may not alias each other, depending on what operations are performed in the function using codice_1 and codice_2. For instance, in codice_10, where A is a pointer to type codice_11, the destination and source pointers do not alias, but in codice_12 they do.
Aliasing and re-ordering.
Aliasing introduces strong constraints on program execution order. If two write accesses which alias occur in sequence in a program text, they must occur in sequence in the final machine code. Re-ordering the accesses will produce an incorrect program result (in the general case). The same is true for a write access and a read access.
However, if two read accesses which alias occur in sequence in a program text, they need not occur in the same sequence in the machine code - aliasing read accesses are safe to re-order. This is because the underlying data is not changed by the read operation, so the same value is always read.
It is vitally important that a compiler can detect which accesses may alias each other, so that re-ordering optimizations can be performed correctly.
Several strategies are possible:
In C or C++, as mandated by the strict aliasing rule, pointer arguments in a function are assumed to not alias if they point to fundamentally different types, except for codice_13 and codice_14, which may alias to any other type. Some compilers allow the strict aliasing rule to be turned off, so that any pointer argument may alias any other pointer arguments. In this case, the compiler must assume that any accesses through these pointers can alias. This can prevent some optimizations from being made.
In C99, the codice_15 keyword was added, which specifies that a pointer argument does not alias any other pointer argument.
In Fortran, procedure arguments and other variables may not alias each other (unless they are pointers or have the target attribute), and the compiler assumes they do not. This enables excellent optimization, and is one major reason for Fortran's reputation as a fast language. (Note that aliasing may still occur within a Fortran function. For instance, if codice_1 is an array and codice_17 and codice_18 are indices which happen to have the same value, then codice_19 are two different names for the same memory location. Fortunately, since the base array must have the same name, index analysis can be done to determine cases where codice_19 cannot alias.)
In pure functional languages, function arguments may usually alias each other, but all pointers are read-only. Thus, no alias analysis needs to be done.
In the performance impact of strict aliasing in the gcc compiler on the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks is studied.
Aliasing and multi-threading.
If multiple threads have names which alias the same memory location, two problems arise.
Firstly, unless the memory location is protected in some way, then read-modify-write operations which are non-atomic might be interleaved with similar operations on another thread, producing incorrect results. In this case, some form of synchronization primitive must be used (e.g. a critical section).
Secondly, even with synchronization, if two aliasing accesses occur in different threads in a non-ordered way, the program behaviour may become non-deterministic - different runs of the same program on the same data may produce different results. Thus, it is often important to impose an explicit ordering between threads which have aliases.

Barnegat High School

Barnegat High School is a comprehensive community public high school that serves students in ninth through twelfth grades from Barnegat Township, in Ocean County, New Jersey, United States, operating as a part of the Barnegat Township School District. 
The school opened in September 2004 with the incoming Freshman class only. There were no upperclassmen until the following year when the first incoming class became Sophomores, and the new incoming Freshmen were in place. It progressed this way until all four classes were in place beginning in September 2007. The first graduation ceremony took place in June 2008 with those first and only Freshmen students back in 2004. Barnegat students who were already attending Southern Regional High School prior to the Barnegat High School opening, remained there until their graduation. The final year that Barnegat had students attending Southern Regional was the 2006-07 school year, with 267 seniors at Southern Regional High School in Stafford Township representing the final group attending under a sending/receiving relationship with the Southern Regional School District that has now ended. Barnegat High School is now open for Grades 9 through 12, with Grade 12 having been added starting in September 2007.
As of the 2010-11 school year, the school had an enrollment of 954 students and 69.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.73:1. There were 134 students (14.0% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 69 (7.2% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.
Awards, recognition and rankings.
The school was the 183rd-ranked public high school in New Jersey out of 328 schools statewide in "New Jersey Monthly" magazine's September 2012 cover story on the state's "Top Public High Schools", after being ranked 193rd in 2010 out of 322 schools listed.
Schooldigger.com ranked the school 187th out of 381 public high schools statewide in its 2011 rankings (a decrease of 36 positions from the 2010 ranking) which were based on the combined percentage of students classified as proficient or above proficient on the two components of the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA), mathematics (82.5%) and language arts literacy (89.6%).
Facility.
The school's building was completed in Barnegat Township under the supervision of the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation. The , two-story building is located on a campus, and includes 29 classrooms, six science labs, two technology labs and art and music rooms, along with a cafeteria, media center, gymnasium, weight room and a 600-seat auditorium. The campus includes six athletic fields and a track. The new building opened to students in September 2004, with ribbon cutting ceremonies held on November 13, 2004. A contract for a second phase of work was awarded on October 16, 2006, and will include of new space, with 28 additional classrooms and an alternate gymnasium. 
Athletics.
The Barnegat High School Bengals compete in the Shore Conference, an athletic conference made up of private and public high schools centered at the Northern Jersey Shore. All schools in this conference are located within Monmouth County and Ocean County. The league operates under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). as of the 2009 season, 10 varsity football players had moved on to NCAA college play in the first five seasons of the program. The varsity track teams had successful 2010 spring track seasons, with the women's team going 6-1 (winning B-South) and the men's team finishing undefeated with a 7-0 record for the first time ever and winning B-South.
Administration.
Members of the school's administration include:
Music.
Barnegat High School's music department is led by faculty members Natalie Altonjy and Anthony Orecchio. The music department offers a wide range of musical ensembles and academic classes. Instrumental ensembles include the 9th grade Concert Band and intermediate Symphonic Band, directed by Anthony Orecchio. Anthony also directs the advanced Wind Ensemble and Jazz Ensemble. Smaller groups include the Brass Ensemble and Pit Orchestra. Vocal Coordinator Natalie Altonjy leads the Chorus and Select Choir, as well as the after school Chorus Club. The ensembles perform and compete numerous times throughout the year. The department's dedication to high-quality musical performance has been recognized throughout the state. Academic classes offered by the music department include Intro to Music. Intro to Film, and 20th Century Music, Music Theory I, AP Music Theory and Classical Guitar Workshop.
The department also includes an award-winning marching band. The Barnegat High School Marching Bengals compete in Tournament of Bands Chapter 1 as a Group II band.

In 2006, playing for the Diamondbacks AA affiliate, the Tennessee Smokies, Ohlendorf went 10–8 with a 3.29 ERA and led the Southern League with four complete games, earning a promotion to AAA Tucson for one playoff start.
New York Yankees.
He was traded to the New York Yankees as the key prospect in the Randy Johnson deal. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said of Ohlendorf: "He's big, physical, eats innings and he's competitive. He's a workhorse."
Ohlendorf pitched mostly for the AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in 2007. Ohlendorf struggled with injuries and inconsistency as a starter with Scranton and was moved to the bullpen. Ohlendorf embraced his new role and pitched extremely effectively, able to maintain a higher velocity and precision on his pitches due to shorter outings. On September 9, when Scranton was eliminated from the playoffs, Ohlendorf was promoted to the Major Leagues.
On September 11, he pitched in his first Major League game against the Toronto Blue Jays for the Yankees. He pitched one inning without allowing a baserunner while striking out one. On September 15, he pitched 1 innings against the Boston Red Sox, allowing a walk and a home run, but recording all four outs on strikeouts. Ohlendorf impressed the Yankees enough in September to earn a spot on the ALDS roster, but struggled in his lone appearance in the series, allowing three runs on four hits and one walk in one inning.
Pittsburgh Pirates.
On July 26, 2008, Ohlendorf was acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates from the New York Yankees in a deal with José Tábata, Jeff Karstens, and Daniel McCutchen for Xavier Nady and Dámaso Marte.
Ohlendorf spent the first month pitching for the AAA Indianapolis Indians and was called up to Pittsburgh on September 2 when the rosters expanded. He was added to the starting rotation and made his first appearance on September 3 against the Cincinnati Reds where he pitched 6 innings and allowed 3 earned runs in a 6–5 Pirates victory. When Ohlendorf faced Will Venable who batted leadoff on September 28, 2008 for San Diego, he became the first Princeton pitcher to oppose a Princeton batter.
Ohlendorf would pitch his first full season in the majors for the Pirates in 2009. He would earn the status of being the only Pirates starter to have a winning record, going 11–10 out of his 29 pitched games with a 3.92 ERA.
Ohlendorf was a stamina pitcher, often lasting late into games. In all, he threw 176 innings, 45 more than his previous year total. The Pirates would shut him down for the remainder of the season following his September 19 start to rest him for next year. Pirates General Manager Neal Huntington would say, "We're looking forward to working with him to put him in position to where he can be a 200-plus inning starter for many, many years to come." 
On September 5, 2009, Ohlendorf became the 40th pitcher to strike out three batters on nine pitches. His final 2009 stats were an 11–10 record, a 3.92 ERA, 25 home runs given up, hit 7 batsmen, walked 53, struck out 109, had a .255 average against, a 1.23 walks and hits per inning pitched, in 176.2 innings.
Ohlendorf was hit in the head by a line drive off of Troy Tulowitzki's bat in a July 28, 2010 game against the Colorado Rockies. He left the game as a precaution. This was the 2nd time in 2010 a Pirates pitcher was hit in the head by a line drive, the first being Chris Jakubauskas. Unlike Jakubauskas, Ohlendorf did not miss any starts. Following the season and a 1–11 record with a 4.07 E.R.A., Ohlendorf won his arbitration hearing and a $439,000 raise to $2,025,000.
Ohlendorf only made two starts in 2011 before going on the disabled list with a shoulder strain, and after experiencing a setback in his rehab program did not make another major league start until August 23. On September 15, Ohlendorf hit his first career home run off Dana Eveland, also becoming the first Pirates pitcher to homer since Paul Maholm did so on May 9, 2009, against the New York Mets. Ohlendorf finished 2011 with a 1–3 record in 9 games with an 8.15 ERA. On December 7, 2011, Ohlendorf was released by the Pirates.
Boston Red Sox.
On February 16, 2012, Ohlendorf signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was assigned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox where he compiled a 4–3 record and 4.61 ERA in 10 starts. Ohlendorf opted out of his contract of June 1, 2012, and became a free agent.
San Diego Padres.
On June 4, 2012, Ohlendorf signed a 1-year deal with the San Diego Padres. He was initially used out of the bullpen, but numerous injuries to the Padres' rotation gave him an opportunity to start. He made his first major league start of the season on June 16.
Ohlendorf made 9 starts in 13 total appearances for the Padres and posted a 4–4 record and a 7.58 ERA in 48 innings. He was optioned to Triple-A Tucson on August 18 after lasting only 13 total innings in his last four starts with a 14.54 ERA. The Padres designated Ohlendorf for assignment on September 4 and he became a free agent after the season.
Washington Nationals.
On January 10, 2013, Ohlendorf signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals.
On July 26, 2013, Ohlendorf started against the New York Mets in the second game of a day/night double header. Ohlendorf enjoyed a successful 2013 season, recording 4 wins and a 3.28 ERA in 16 appearances. After the season, Ohlendorf signed a one-year deal to return to Washington, avoiding arbitration.
Scouting report.
Ohlendorf relies on a sinking fastball thrown at 89-92 MPH, along with a low 80's slider and a changeup. He has missed parts of the last 2 seasons due to injury.
Personal.
His brother Chad also attended Princeton and pitched for the school.
After the 2006 season, he became an intern for the University of Texas System's Office of Finance. Following the 2009 season, Ohlendorf began an 8 week internship for the Department of Agriculture.
In 2010, he was chosen as the third-smartest athlete in sports by the "Sporting News", behind baseball pitcher Craig Breslow and football player Myron Rolle.

Noël Riley Fitch

Noël Riley Fitch is a biographer and historian of expatriate intellectuals in Paris in the first half of the 20th century. She is the author of several books on Paris (Literary Cafes of Paris, Walks in Hemingway’s Paris) as well as three biographies: "Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation" (1983), translated into Japanese, Spanish, German, Italian and French; "Anaïs: The Erotic Life of Anaïs Nin" (1993), published in French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Polish, and nominated for the Grand prix des lectrices de Elle; and she is the first authorized biographer of Julia Child - "Appetite for Life: the Biography of Julia Child" (1997). The Ernest Hemingway book, a biographical and geographical study of his Paris years, has been published in Dutch, the Cafés of Paris book in Dutch and German.
Fitch was born in 1937 in New Haven, Connecticut of New England parents (John E. Riley and Dorcas Tarr) and raised with two younger sisters in the Snake River Valley in Idaho. She has lived in Quincy, Massachusetts; in Pasadena, La Jolla and Los Angeles, California; and in Paris, France. Her writing career began when she was a columnist for her high school and college school papers; but it was in graduate school that she discovered the story of Sylvia Beach’s bookshop on the Left Bank of Paris and decided she would tell the story of Sylvia Beach, her bookshop Shakespeare and Company (1919–1942), and the publication of James Joyce’s Ulysses (the 1922 novel that would change world fiction). Since then every book Fitch has written has some connection with Paris and the artists who lived and worked there, including her biographies of Beach, Nin, and Child. In June 2011 Noel Riley Fitch was awarded the prestigious Prix de la Tour Montparnasse literary award in France for her book "Sylvia Beach: Une americaine `a Paris" Publishers 2011, the French translation by Elizabeth Danger of Noel's widely acclaimed 1983 book "Sylvia Beach and the Lost Generation"
Her book "Appetite for Life: The Biography of Julia Child" (1997) was written with Mrs. Child’s full cooperation and exclusive authorization. Publishers Weekly said the book is written 'warmly and compellingly.' Kirkus Reviews called its “details. . .exquisite” and the story “exhaustively researched, charming.” Entertainment Weekly named it number five of the ten best books of the year.
Following her earlier "Literary Cafés of Paris", Fitch returned to the travel genre to author "The Grand Literary Cafés of Europe" (London, 2006; US, 2007). Covering the history of coffee and the coffeehouse, the book features nearly 40 cafes in 20 countries, from London to Moscow, Lisbon to Bucharest and Rome. "Paris Café; The Sélect Crowd", co-authored with illustrator Rick Tulka, was published November 2007.
Fitch appears in several documentary films, including "Portrait of a Bookstore as an Old Man", "Berenice Abbott: A View of the Twentieth Century" (1992), "Paris The Luminous Years" 2010 and the A&E Biography of Julia Child first shown October 14, 1997 and based on her book, "Appetite for Life".
Fitch earned a Ph.D. from Washington State University and has taught at Point Loma Nazarene University, San Diego State University, University of Southern California, and the American University of Paris. She is presently writing the story of the Irish woman Louison O’Morphi Louise O’Murphy, mistress of Louis XV, model for Rococo painter François Boucher, and subject of a chapter in Giacomo Casanova’s memoirs. The book has grown out of many years of Franco-Irish history.
Ms. Fitch recently retired from lecturing at both the University of Southern California and the American University of Paris. She and her husband live in Los Angeles, Paris, and New York City. She has one grown daughter.

Aleppo International Stadium

Aleppo International Stadium () is an Olympic-standard, multi-use, all-covered and all-seater stadium in the Syrian city of Aleppo. It is the largest stadium in Syria, and is currently used mostly for football matches. It serves as a home ground of Al-Ittihad football club. It also hosted some home games of the Syrian football team. The stadium was opened in 2007 and holds 53,200 spectators. The venue is located near the al-Hamadaniah Sports City in the southern districts of Aleppo.
History.
The construction of the stadium was launched in 1980, based on the design of the Polish constructor/architect Stanisław Kuś, with the assistance of architect "Fawzi Khalifeh". It was scheduled to be completed in 1987 to become ready for the Mediterranean games. However, the construction process was stopped and delayed for 2 decades due to financial difficulties, until 2003 when the officials of the Syrian Government implemented a serious programme to overcome all difficulties. 
Finally, after a record period of 27 years of construction, the stadium became ready with its entire facilities in early 2007. Officially, the stadium was opened on 3 April 2007 with an inaugural friendly match between al-Ittihad and Fenerbahçe of Turkey which ended in a 2-2 draw in front of 75 thousand spectators. The first goal scored in the stadium came at the 8th minute of the inaugural match, through Abdul Fattah Al Agha. The Syrian president Bashar Al Assad attended the opening ceremony and the match.
Facts.
The stadium has five levels: the first level is the sport ground itself, with its surrounding facilities, the second level consists of training halls, different facilities and support services. The rest three levels are designed to host the attendants' seats; the first tier holds up to 25,000 seats while the second and the third host 14,100 each. The VIP hall located on the third level, is designed and decorated with oriental woodworks.
The stadium occupies an area of 3.5 hectares out of the 33 hectares of the whole sports complex. It is provided with two large electronic screens (10 tones, 7X15 meters each). The seats are all in light blue color with a small number of white colored seats placed in the eastern tribune to form the word "Aleppo" both in Arabic and English languages. The stadium is all-covered with a pre-built concrete which is the second largest one of its type in the world. The parking area of the arena hosts more than 8,000 vehicles. The entry to the stadium is secured through 26 gates.

As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi

As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi is the title of the debut studio album by singer Anna Vissi, released in Greece and Cyprus by Minos in 1977.
Album information.
In the 1970s in the Greek music industry, the prerequisite to recording a personal album was to prove one's artistic merits by collaborating and recording with other established musicians. Having proved herself by collaborating with the legendary Mikis Theodorakis and other influential artists like George Dalaras, record company Minos finally granted Vissi the privilege of recording her debut personal studio album. The album featured new songs and songs previously included in various composer albums.
The lead single, "As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi" was sung by Vissi at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, on September 26, 1977, prior to the album release, winning first price. 
In 1987, "As Kanoume Apopse Mian Arhi" was among the selection of albums that Minos-EMI decided to release on CD as it was still popular. The Minos EMI reissue for the back catalogue "Minos EMI CD Club" series, which was regularly shipped in shops throughout the years, is shown here.
In 2006 it was re-released in a remasted edition including a bonus CD with additional songs from her early career with Minos featured on albums of other successful artists. 
In 2007 the songs of the album were included on EMI's boxset of Vissi recordings "Back to Time (Complete EMI Years)" which, despite of being a box set, charted on the Top 10 of sales charts.
Music.
Music and lyrics are by Doros Georgiadis, Spiros Blassopoulos, Antonis Vardis, Panos Falaras, Giannis Spanos, Manos Eleftheriou, M. Terzis, G. Karakatsanis, G. Gerasimidis, and K. Loizos.

Strait passage

Strait passage is a concept in Admiralty law which allows for a vessel to pass through a strait. Given the United Nations' extension of territorial waters to a maximum width of 12 miles, straits with width of less than 24 miles are entirely composed of territorial waters. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea however, innocent passage rules do not apply and ships both commercial and military are allowed passage as if they were traversing the high seas.

Noah (grape)

The Noah grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species "Vitis labrusca" or 'fox grape' which is used for table, juice and wine production. Noah has berries of a light green/yellow and has medium sized, cylindrical-conical, well formed fruit clusters with thick bloom similar to those of Elvira.
Although popularly classified as "Vitis labrusca", Noah is the result of a 50/50 cross between Taylor ("Vitis riparia") and an unknown "Vitis labrusca" The vines are moderately vigorous and moderately cold hardy. It buds late with secondary buds being fruitful and ripens approximately at the same time as Concord. Noah is very disease resistant and shows resistance to mildew, black rot and phylloxera - it is used as a rootstock.
Use.
It is a slip skin variety, meaning that the skin separates easily from the fruit. The grapes are used to make wine, most notably Uhudler and to a lesser extent Fragolino. Noah being "Vitis" x "labruscana" imparts a 'foxiness' to the wine and because of this is thought to be objectionable, therefore it is not seen as a grape capable of making wines of good quality though does have its admirers.
Noah is not a commercially important grape variety with small plantations in USA, France, Romania, Croatia and Italy. The grapes do not keep well and thus do not transport well therefore they can only be found within close distance of the source.
Synonyms.
Noah has a number of aliases including: Belo Otelo, Charvat and Tatar Rizling.

<doc id="9921684" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9921684" title="Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza">
Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza

The Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza is an urban park and gathering place, located in front of the Arizona state capitol complex in downtown Phoenix, Arizona. It serves as a home to a number of memorials honoring prominent figures in Arizona history as well as memorializing significant wars and other events that have had an impact on the state. It is designated as one of the Phoenix Points of Pride.
History.
The plaza was established on March 9, 1978, by the Arizona Legislature in honor of Governor Wesley Bolin, who had died a mere 5 days previously on March 4. Prior to the resolution creating the plaza, it had simply been a part of the Legislative Governmental Mall. While the plaza exists only as a part of the Mall, in common usage the terms are interchangeable and the name of the plaza is often used in preference to the Mall.
Much like the National Mall on which it is loosely based, the Legislative Governmental Mall is intended as an open-air public space featuring monuments, memorials and gardens. Some of these monuments were erected prior to the inception of the Plaza, such as the monument to the USS "Arizona" which was dedicated over a year earlier on December 7, 1976. The Plaza, when dedicated, included these existing memorials and all subsequent memorials have been located within the boundaries of the plaza.
Also located in the Plaza is the memorial dedicated to the 158th Infantry Regiment, the oldest and most prestigious unit in Arizona. The monument, based off a captured Japanese monument in the Philippines, stands as one of the few if only memorials to the regiment which served as one of the premier unit of World War II.
Owing to its location directly in front of the state capitol, the plaza has also become a meeting place and a focal point for protests and demonstrations, such as the 2006 United States immigration reform protests, with Phoenix participants culminating in a rally at the plaza. Over 100,000 participants took part in the display.
Monuments and Memorials.
The plaza is home to 29 memorials dedicated to topics as wide ranging as important individuals, organizations and events. Among the more prominent are the mast and anchor of the USS "Arizona", memorials to major wars such as World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, the Korean War and Desert Storm. Also of note are some memorials that have caused considerable controversy, as mentioned below.
The following is a full list of memorials found at the plaza.
Controversies.
Due to the sometimes controversial nature of the events or subject matter of the monuments in the plaza, they have become the subject of intense criticism and sometimes even legal battles.
The Ten Commandments Memorial.
The Ten Commandments memorial, one of those placed in the Mall prior to the creation of the Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza, became the target of an attempt to remove it in 2003. The American Civil Liberties Union argued that the memorial violated the concept of separation of church and state.
The monument had originally been erected in 1964 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles in connection to Cecil B. DeMille, director of the famous 1956 film adaptation of The Ten Commandments.
While the effort to remove the monument did not succeed, the controversy surrounding its inclusion on a government operated location continues today.
Arizona 9/11 Memorial.
The memorial to commemorate the September 11, 2001, attacks was unveiled on the fifth anniversary of the attacks, September 11, 2006. Almost immediately, criticism that the memorial contained anti-American sentiment began to surface. Some of the descriptions have also been described as meaningless.
In response to the critics, the commission in charge of the memorial's design and construction has promised to review it and make changes if necessary. This process is ongoing.

Campaign to the South of Baoding

The Campaign to the South of Baoding (保南战役) consisted of several battles fought in regions south of Baoding between the nationalists and the communists during the Chinese Civil War after World War II, and resulted in the communist victory.
Prelude.
In December 1946, after the setback of the failed attempts to take Easy County (Yi Xian, 易县) and Full City (Man Cheng, 满城) regions, the nationalists redeployed their forces along the railroad from Beijing to Baoding to fragment the enemy base into smaller pieces. However, when carrying out the new strategy, the nationalist force was overstretched and the region between Wangdu (望都) and Zhengding to the south of Baoding was thinly manned: the vast area of over 200 km stretch of land was only guarded by a detachment of the 32nd Division of the nationalist 3rd Army and four regiments of the nationalist 5th Security Division totaling 20,000 troops. The communists decided to take this advantage by launching a campaign aimed to sever the nationalist communication / transportation line in central Hebei, thus cutting off the food supply for the nationalists in western Hebei.
Order of battle.

The Campaign.
The communist 10th Brigade, the 11th Brigade, the Independent 1st Brigade and units of the 3rd and 9th Military Districts were tasked with the main responsibilities of the campaign, while the 8th Independent Brigade would launch assaults along the railroad around Gaobei Hotel (Gao Bei Dian, 高碑店) region to the north of Baoding to tie down the nationalists in order to prevent them from reinforcing the nationalists in the south. The communist 2nd and 3rd Column would station at the Town of Sun City (Yang Cheng Zhen, 阳城镇) and White Bunker Town (Bai Bao Zhen, 白堡镇), waiting to ambush the nationalist reinforcements if there was any.
At the dawn on January 21, 1947, under the cover of heavy snow storm, the communist 10th Brigade and the 11th Brigade launched their surprise attacks on the Imperial Capital Village (王京村) and the town of Wangdu (望都), successfully taking the both nationalist strongholds and completely annihilated the nationalist garrison consisted of a battalion and a regiment of the nationalist 5th Security Division in the process. Meanwhile, the communist 1st Independent Brigade and communist units from the 3rd and the 9th Military Districts launched their offensives on the nationalist positions along the railroad. At night of January 21, 1947, the communist 4th Column had succeeded in penetrating into region between the town Xinle (新乐) and the town of Ding (定) County. On January 23, 1947, the communist 4th Column sent out a detachment to successfully take the region of Camp West Hotel (Zhai Xi Dian, 寨西 店), while the bulk of its force was deployed along the railroad to ambush the nationalist reinforcement. On January 24, 1947, the nationalist reinforcement from Zhengding consisted of a regiment of the 5th Security Division and a portion of the nationalist 32nd Division was completely annihilated by the waiting communist 4th Column in the region of Shijiading (十家町). Learning the news of the disaster, the nationalist defenders of the town Xinle (新乐) was forced to abandon the town when the communist 1st Independent Brigade attacked. On January 28, 1947, the communist 4th Column launched the final assault on the besieged town of Ding (定) County, badly mauling the nationalist brigade defending the town. As the nationalist survivors attempted to flee, they were ambushed by the communist 2nd Column at Wangdu (望都) region, and the communist victory was complete with the conclusion of the campaign.
Outcome.
The nationalists suffered more than 8,000 losses in their defeat, and the link between Shijiazhuang and Baoding was severed. Additionally, towns included Wangdu (望都), Ding (定) County, and Xinle (新乐) fell into the enemy hands, while the previously separated communist bases in the central Hebei and the border area of Hebei and Shanxi was successfully linked up by the enemy to form a new base with much larger size.

CURIE

A CURIE (short for "Compact URI") defines a generic, abbreviated syntax for expressing URIs. It is an abbreviated URI expressed in CURIE syntax, and may be found in both XML and non-XML grammars. A CURIE may be considered a datatype.
An example of CURIE syntax: codice_1
The square brackets may be used to prevent ambiguities between CURIEs and regular URIs, yielding so-called safe CURIEs.
QNames (the namespace prefixes used in XML) often are used as a CURIE, and may be considered a type of CURIE. CURIEs, as defined by the W3C, will be better defined and may include checking. Unlike QNames, the part of a CURIE after the colon does not need to conform to the rules for XML element names.

Surface lure

A surface lure is a fishing lure designed to waddle, pop, lock, drop, pulse, twitch or fizz across the surface of the water as it is retrieved, and in doing so imitate surface prey for fish such as mice, lizards, frogs, cicadas, moths and small injured fish.
A typical surface lure has a solid body made out of wood or plastic, carries one or two treble hooks, and has an eyelet at the front of the lure body to attach the fishing line. "Waddlers" get their action from a scooped metal dish attached to the front of the lure body. "Poppers" get their action from a cupped face carved or molded into the front of the lure body. "Fizzers" get their action both from the fisherman manipulating the lure with the fishing rod and from one or more blades attached to the lure body, that spin when the lure is pulled and create a fizzing noise said to imitate the buzzing wings of a drowning insect. 
Sizeable fish can create a sudden, noisy and spectacular explosion when they take a surface lure, usually giving the fisherman a fright in the process. Catching fish on surface lures is therefore considered a fairly exciting form of fishing.

The Phoenix Collegiate

The Phoenix Collegiate is a community secondary school and sixth form located in the Hateley Heath area of West Bromwich, a town in the West Midlands of England. The school was formed in 2010 from the merger of Menzies High School and Manor High School, both located in the metropolitan borough of Sandwell. Originally operating from both former school sites, today the Phoenix Collegiate is based mainly at the former Menzies High School campus: Year 11 pupils still attend the former Manor High School site in Friar Park Road, though this site is mostly closed off and is due to be sold off for development in summer 2013 following the departure of the current remaining Year 11s.
History.
The origins of the school can be traced to West Bromwich Municipal Secondary School at the West Bromwich Institute, which opened in 1902 on Lodge Lane. It was funded by Sir George Kenrick. It became West Bromwich Grammar School in 1944, and moved to new buildings on Clarkes Lane in 1964. It was only a grammar school at this site for five years, becoming a comprehensive school in September 1969 when West Bromwich borough council (which merged with Warley five years later to form Sandwell) abolished grammar and secondary modern schools in the area. 
The school was used as one of the filming locations for the 1986 film "Clockwise", starring John Cleese.
Menzies High School was formally merged with Manor High School in 2010 to form the Phoenix Collegiate.

John Zaccaro

John Anthony Zaccaro (born April 5, 1933) is a real estate developer and owner of P. Zaccaro & Company, which was founded by his father Philip Zaccaro. The company acts as a landlord for properties in the Little Italy, Chinatown, and East Side areas of Manhattan and (formerly) in Queens. He is the widower of the late Geraldine Ferraro, former U.S. House of Representatives member from New York and the 1984 Democratic Party Vice Presidential nominee.
Biography.
Zaccaro was born in the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn neighborhood, to Italian American parents born in the U.S. When an infant the family moved, and he grew up in Forest Hills, Queens (or Kew Gardens, Queens). He attended Loyola School and Rhodes Preparatory School, both in Manhattan. A severe football injury left him unavailable for the draft, but he nonetheless joined the United States Marine Corps Platoon Leaders Class, becoming a second lieutenant. He was drafted by the Brooklyn Dodgers out of high school. He attended Iona College from 1951 to 1955 and graduated with a degree in business administration.
Zaccaro has been a licensed real estate broker since 1951 and a member of the Real Estate Board of New York since 1955. He started working as a salesman for his father, Phillip J. Zaccaro, who had established P. Zaccaro Co., Inc. in 1917. As an agent for the City of New York, that firm had assembled properties which were condemned and upon which Stuyvesant Town, Peter Cooper Village, and Knickerbocker Village were built in the 1930s and 1940s. 
Zaccaro and Ferraro met in 1954, when she was a sophomore at Marymount Manhattan College. They became engaged in August 1959, and married on July 16, 1960. They had three children, Donna (born 1962), John Jr. (born 1964), and Laura (born 1966).
In the late 1970s, Zaccaro was appointed a member of the New York City Housing Council. 
By 1984, Zaccaro's company owned or managed over 20 residential and commercial properties in Manhattan. According to a "New York Times" article, Zaccaro's buildings had accumulated over 100 mostly minor code violations; some tenants complained of poor living conditions in apartments.
Shortly after Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale selected Ferraro as his vice presidential running mate in the 1984 U.S. presidential election, Zaccaro became the center of controversy due to the couple's finances and his refusal to release his separately-filed tax returns. Ultimately they were submitted, but the matter diminished Ferraro's rising stardom and removed the momentum the Mondale–Ferraro ticket gained following the pick. Mondale and Ferraro lost the general election in a landslide to incumbent President Ronald Reagan, although political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election that year.
In January 1985, Zaccaro pled guilty to fraudulently obtaining bank financing in a real estate transaction and was fined $1,000 and was sentenced to 150 hours of community service. Zaccaro stated afterward, "My lawyers have advised me that since my client and I withdrew the loan application, since no one but I was injured, and since I received no benefit, they felt that they could successfully defend this case" but he said he entered the plea to spare his family more publicity and to "conclude the matter and try to return to private life."
In October 1986, he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted of all charges at trial.
Zaccaro's business associations have also created controversy, and they and the couple's finances again became a damaging issue during Ferraro's 1992 Senate Democratic primary campaign (which she entered as the front-runner, and lost by a close margin). Zaccaro was not an issue in her 1998 Senate Democratic primary campaign, which she also lost.
P. Zaccaro Co., Inc. continues as a third-generation, privately held real estate investment, development, and management firm that specializes in Manhattan. As principal for over 50 years, Zaccaro has been involved in every aspect of the real estate industry as a manager, broker, developer, or principal. Some of his past clients are the Emigrant Savings Bank, Bowery Savings Bank, and New York University. He has developed property in New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut. Zaccaro now works with his son, John Jr., a licensed attorney and real estate broker.
Zaccaro has been appointed as a trustee in bankruptcy by the courts of New York, Queens, and Kings Counties. Zaccaro has also served as a trustee at various independent schools in the city, including Saint David's School and Convent of the Sacred Heart. He is currently a member of the board of directors of his co-op where he resides.

The Dawning of the Day

"The Dawning of the Day" (, literally "The bright ring of the day") is the name of two old Irish airs.
O'Connellan's "Fáinne Geal an Lae" is often confused with the later pentatonic melody to which the words "The Dawning of the Day" is set. The O'Connellan air is different in a number of respects, although there are melodic resemblances. Words are still sung to variants of it which mostly use only the first half of the air as printed in Bunting and other collections.
The Irish-language lyrics of "Fáinne Geal an Lae" describe an Aisling where the poet encounters a mysterious beautiful woman. In this case, she upbraids him as a frivolous rake and points to the approaching dawn.

<doc id="9921949" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9921949" title="Hut Tax War of 1898">
Hut Tax War of 1898

The Hut Tax War of 1898 was a resistance in the newly annexed Protectorate of Sierra Leone to a new, severe tax imposed by the colonial military governor. The British had established the Protectorate to demonstrate their dominion over the territory to other European powers following the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. The imposed tax constituted a major burden on residents of the Protectorate; 24 indigenous chiefs had signed a petition against it explaining why its adverse effects on their societies, to no avail. The immediate catalyst for hostilities was the use of force by British officials to arrest the Temne chief Bai Bureh, a general and war strategist, because of ill-founded rumours. He is typically identified as the chief who initiated an armed resistance in the North in 1898, but the British forces shot first. Late 20th-century sources suggest he has been unfairly identified by the colonial government as a primary instigator and that the colonial government had provoked the war by its hostile actions. Later that year, resistance arose in the south by the leading Mende. 
History.
Colonel Frederic Cardew was not an administrator, but a professional soldier who had spent years in India and South Africa. He imposed the tax for economic reasons to raise revenues to pay for administration of the Protectorate. 
The owner of a four-roomed hut was to be taxed ten shillings a year; those with smaller huts would pay five shillings. His staff failed to advise him that the taxes, first imposed on 1 January 1898, often were higher than the value of the dwellings. In addition, the government taxed unoccupied dwellings. Lastly, Cardew's demands that the chiefs organize their own residents to maintain the roads ignored the fact that the people needed to devote their labor to subsistence farming in order to survive. A total of 24 chiefs signed a petition to the colonial government explaining why these requirements were so burdensome and threatened their societies. In addition, the chiefs believed the tax was an attack on their sovereignty. 
The new requirements sparked two rebellions in the hinterland of Sierra Leone in 1898, one in the northern area of the Temne, led by Bai Bureh, a general and military strategist, and the other in the southern area by the Mende, led by Momoh Jah. 
According to documentation by Arthur Abraham, the colonial government reacted to rumour, initiated an arrest of Bai Bureh based on no evidence, and fired the first shots against his followers in February 1898, thus provoking open warfare. The British issued a warrant to arrest Bai Bureh, the 61-year-old chief of the Temne, with the idea that a display of force would convince the natives to pay the taxes due. By February, it became obvious that resistance was spreading. But Bai Bureh continued to make peace overtures in April and June, including through the mediation of Limba chief Alamy Suluku of Bumban, which Cardew rejected, saying that the general had to surrender without condition. 
Bai Bureh had gained the support of several prominent native chiefs, including the powerful Kissi chief Kai Londo and the Limba chief Suluku. Both chiefs sent warriors and weapons to aid Bai Bureh, who felt he had to defend himself against Captain Sharpe's unprovoked aggression. 
Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British for several months of the war. Hundreds of British troops and hundreds of Bureh's fighters were killed. Some innocent European and Africans were killed. In one case, Johnny Taylor, a Creole trader, was "chopped" to pieces by Bai Bureh's warriors. 
As frustration grew, Governor Cardew realized that the war not easily winnable so he ordered a "scotched earth policy" wherein the British would burn entire villages, farmlands, pastures e.t.c.. This change in tactics tremendously affected Bai Bureh's war effort due to the reduction of provisions to feed not only his warriors but his subjects as well. He also realized that the cost of reparations was getting insurmountable as the British were relentless in pursuing the new policy. 
To save his people from more property loses, Bai Bureh finally gave up the fight, surrendering on 11 November 1898. Despite the British government's recommendation of leniency, the acting governor had Bai Bureh and two colleagues sent into exile in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The British convicted and hanged 96 of his comrades. Bai Bureh was allowed to return in 1905, when he reassumed chieftaincy of Kasseh.
The Southern front was based in the Southern provinces, and was led mainly by Mende (and a few Sherbro) warriors and chiefs. In this area, the warriors killed many Krio traders and civil servants living in the provinces. Colonel Marshal, the British commander, wrote that the operations, from February to November 1898, involved "some of the most stubborn fighting that has been seen in West Africa. No such continuity of opposition had at any previous time been experienced on this part of the coast."
Bai Bureh gave an account of his side to Rev. Allen Elba, who sent an account to Cardew. But, many historians have ignored this material.
The defeat in the Hut Tax war ended large-scale organised armed opposition to colonialism. But, resistance and opposition took other forms, particularly intermittent, wide-scale rioting and chaotic labour disturbances. Riots in 1955 and 1956 involved "many tens of thousands" of natives in the protectorate.

Soko Richardson (December 8, 1939 – January 29, 2004) was an American rhythm and blues drummer. His career spanned almost fifty years, during which he performed and recorded with seminal groups including John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and the The Ike & Tina Turner Revue. He is perhaps best known for his innovative arrangement of the Ike and Tina version of the Creedence Clearwater Revival song, "Proud Mary".
Biography.
Born in New Iberia, Louisiana, Richardson began his musical career at the age of 16, when he left home to tour the South with local bands. Shortly thereafter Ike Turner, upon hearing Richardson play in Texas, hired him to play with his band, Kings of Rhythm, and then later with The Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Richardson worked with Turner for the next ten years. In March 1971 Richardson's arrangement of the Creedence Clearwater Revival song, "Proud Mary" reached number four on the pop charts, and number five on the R&B charts. The song became a signature song for Tina Turner, and won the band a Grammy for "Best R&B Vocal Performance By A Group."
In 1971, Richardson joined John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, with whom he would tour and record for the next decade, playing with many of the diverse artists to whom Mayall gave a start.
In the mid 1980s, Richardson joined Albert Collins and the Icebreakers, and became an influential member of the Chicago Blues scene. He helped earn the Icebreakers the WC Handy Award as Blues Band of The Year in 
1985.
Over the years Richardson recorded with many other artists, including Pee Wee Crayton, Bobby Womack and English guitarist Terry Reid, with whom he was recording an album at the time of his death. Though limited by health problems in later years, he continued to perform and record, and sit in on jam sessions with friends. He played his last gig a few weeks before his death, at a club with Reid.
Richardson died in the early hours of January 29, 2004, in his home in Los Angeles, from complications of
diabetes. He was 64.

Ski film

A ski film is a motion picture with sequences of expedition, recreation, competition, or acrobatic exhibition on snow skis. These non-fiction films capture the experience of an athletic outdoor snow sporting culture. Ski films typically present one or more techniques (ski jumping, cross-country, downhill, freestyle), locations, or skiers (expert, celebrity or novice). Categories include the feature, documentary of competition or other event (such as a snow festival), instruction or technique demonstration, retrospective history, travel guide showcasing a region, or a short subject (such as included in a newsreel compilation). More than 200 such videos debuted in 2006. Notable examples are listed at the Ski and Snowboard Film Institute, or have received awards from the International Ski Film Festival, IF3 International Freeski Film Festival, Cold Smoke Winter Film, "Powder" magazine, or similar. 
Feature film.
Feature length entertainment films about skiing, skiers, and the ski lifestyle, shot in actual locations around the world and featuring the best skiers of the day, have been released annually since 1938. Although not distributed through normal film channels, these movies were first exhibited on the resort, club, film festival and ski show circuit and are now available via home video and internet download. 
Official film trailers, released online to advertise the coming feature, present highlights of the film. Feature content typically includes 
Many features include sequences of other mountain, airborne, water, or speed sports. Slow motion and time-lapse effects and skier point of view shots have been used in ski films since the first features of Dr. Fanck. Many film makers release a film early in the ski season, with content recorded in the past season or two. The following list is a chronology of prolific feature production companies or directors with numerous ski films over the indicated time span.
Other films.
Many ski film makers have initially or predominately released featurettes and short films, in addition to features.
Featurette and short film series.
Ski film may also refer to a fictional theatrical-release comedy or drama which incorporates a skiing theme, although the on-snow scenes may have been enhanced by the use of stand-ins for the actors and special effects.

Requiem for a Dream (soundtrack)

Requiem for a Dream is the soundtrack album from the 2000 film Requiem for a Dream. It was composed by Clint Mansell and performed by the Kronos Quartet. The music for the film is noted for its minimalist qualities in which it uses constant harmonies, a steady pulse, and often variation of musical phrases to drive a point. The soundtrack is best known for the song "Lux Aeterna", which has appeared also in one trailer for "", rearranged and re-orchestrated.
Background.
With the success of the film also came a successful soundtrack. Composer of the soundtrack Clint Mansell has worked very closely with Darren Aronofsky throughout his movie career. Mansell also has worked on Aronofsky's first film "π". Both Pi and Requiem for a Dream are noted for their off notes and range of tenebrous emotions. Working with Mansell for the first time, Kronos Quartet, brought in their simplistic four- piece band. In the opening credits before the title of the movie appears we can hear the quartet tuning their instruments, before hearing a conductor tap on his music stand to ready the quartet for a performance. The maestro bringing them to attention is Aronofsky. Aronofsky and Mansell both grew up listening to Hiphop which they based a lot of their decision making on that type of music. Mansell took a classic hiphop record and reworked it with the score. Aronofsky saw Requiem as a "monster movie, only when something goes bad you hear the music." All of the music in the film are influenced the characters and goes with the drugs in the film. Even though none of the characters actually say the word "Heroin", they still base the music around heroin and cravings. 
The soundtrack has been widely praised, and in particular the track "Lux Aeterna" (which itself is much used in the film) has subsequently been used in various forms of media. The theme was reorchestrated for "" trailer and is known by the name "Requiem for a Tower", presented by "Corner Stone Cues". The theme has been featured in trailers for other films, including "Babylon A.D.", "The Da Vinci Code", "I Am Legend", "Sunshine", and "Valley of Flowers". It also appeared in the video games "Total Miner: Forge" (Xbox Live Indie Game 2011), "Assassin's Creed", and in numerous TV spots and advertisements, and at sporting events. Use of the theme has extended to the point where it is interchangeable with the name "Requiem for a Dream."
A remix album, "Requiem for a Dream: Remixed", contained new mixes of the music by Paul Oakenfold, Josh Wink, Jagz Kooner, and Delerium, among others.
The Kronos Quartet.
The Kronos Quartet is the name of the band that performed the soundtrack for Requiem for a Dream. The quartet was founded in 1973 by David Harrington in Seattle. The members were David Harrington and John Sherba, violins; Hank Dutt, viola; and Joan Jeanrenaud, cello. The group was chosen for its minimalist approach.
Critical reception.
Reviews have generally been very favourable. Allmusic gave the album four stars, saying that the score "manages to be appropriately dark and disturbing, as well as compulsively listenable"; "Salon" praised the "terrific musical score"; and "The Observer" of the University of Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College called the score "heart-stopping". Filmcritic.com, in a negative review of the score, spoke of "the driving, thumping, angry, brutal violin score which drums like a hammer and chain beating you into submission."
Inspirations.
"Requiem for a Dream" was written by Hubert Selby Jr. who was inspired to write it when he lived in LA. He wanted to write about something in the real world rather than something from the fantasy genre. One of the main influences of his work was his life experiences. Hubert’s life was very unfortunate; at the age of 18, he was a merchant seaman during World War II. During that time he was hospitalized for three years for treatment of tuberculosis and other illnesses or injuries he acquired. 
Six months before Hubert wrote "Requiem for a Dream", he was sick with pneumonia, going in and out of comas. His wife was worried about his health but he refused to go to a hospital. One night, his wife woke up from a dream about two spirits that had opened the door in their room; she says that she could tell that they were male and female. The two spirits told her that if Hubert did not get medical attention, he might die. She eventually called a friend, who happened to be a respiratory therapist. She told him about all the things that have been happening with Hubert and he scolded him about his health and told her to take him to the hospital.
Composer.
Clint Mansell, the composer of this soundtrack, is an English musician, composer, and former lead singer and guitarist of the band "Pop Will Eat Itself" (1996). Aronofsky, the director of the film, hired him to score his film, Pi. He scored "Requiem for a Dream" in 2000, and all of Aronofsky's films since.

Lapidus (name)

Lapidus (including its variant spellings) is a surname rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition, specifically from "Lapidoth", which was borne, in the Bible, by the husband of Deborah, and hence probably derived from "lapidot", the Hebrew word for torches, yet is not exclusive to one religion or nationality. 
Lapidus is also derived from the Latin word "lapideus", meaning 'made of stone'; 'stony', also from the Latin "lapis" meaning 'stone'. It could also be derived from the Latin adjective "lepidus" meaning pleasant or charming. A branch of the Roman "gens" Aemilia was cognominated Lepidus. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was a member of the Second Triumvirate, with Octavius (later Caesar Augustus) and Marcus Antonius.
In popular culture.
There is a character named Frank Lapidus, a pilot played by Jeff Fahey, on the ABC television show LOST.
There is also a character named Merc Lapidus, a producer played by John Pankow, on the television show Episodes.

<doc id="9922049" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9922049" title="Madame Montour">
Madame Montour

Madame Montour (1667 or c. 1685 – c. 1753) was an influential interpreter, diplomat, and local leader of French Canadian and probably Native American ancestry. Although she was well known, her exact identity is unclear because her contemporaries usually referred to her only as "Madame" or "Mrs." Montour. She may have been Isabelle (or Elizabeth) Couc, a Métis born in 1667, or perhaps Isabelle Couc's niece, who was born around 1685 and whose given name is uncertain.
In 1711, Madame Montour began working as an interpreter and diplomatic consultant for the province of New York. Around 1727, she and her husband Carondawana, an Oneida, moved to the province of Pennsylvania. Her village, known as Ostonwakin, was near the modern borough of Montoursville, which was named for her.
Montour's son Andrew Montour also became an important interpreter, as did his son John Montour. Some of Madame Montour's female relatives were also prominent local leaders, and have often been confused with her.
Identity debate.
Much is uncertain about Madame Montour's early life. In 1744, Witham Marshe met the "celebrated Mrs. Montour" at an important treaty conference held in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. When asked about her background, Montour told Marshe that she had been born in Canada to a French gentleman. She claimed that she had been captured by the Iroquois about fifty years earlier (i.e. around 1694), when she was about ten years old, and that she did not remember much about her parents. She had been adopted and raised by the Iroquois, she said, and had eventually married an Iroquois war captain, with whom she had several children before his death in battle.
The vague details of Madame Montour's life resulted in much speculation, mythmaking, and confusion. She has often been confounded with her female relatives, particularly Catharine Montour. Historians have long attempted to separate fact from fiction and piece together her life.
In 1974, historian William A. Hunter tentatively identified Madame Montour as Elizabeth Couc, a Métis born in 1667 near Trois-Rivières, New France, in what is now Quebec, Canada. Elizabeth Couc was a daughter of Pierre Couc "dit" Lafleur (1627–1690), a French-born fur trader and interpreter, and Marie Miteoamegoukoué (1631–1699), a Christian Algonquin woman. Hunter conceded that some of the evidence connecting Madame Montour with Elizabeth Couc was "vague and contradictory". He accepted that Madame Montour had been captured by an Iroquois war party around 1695, but if she was Elizabeth Couc, she was much older than ten at the time.
Subsequent historians explained the discrepancies by suggesting that Madame Montour was deliberately vague about her past, perhaps to conceal her humble birth or Indian ancestry, which allowed her to present herself as a genteel French woman, albeit one in Indian dress. Elizabeth (or Élisabeth) Couc probably went by the name of Isabelle, the French form of Elizabeth; the two names were then interchangeable. Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch uncovered a record from 1711 that lists payments to "Eysabelle Montour interpretress", the only known reference to Montour's first name in an English document. Isabelle Couc presumably had an Algonquin name too, but it is unknown.
Other historians have argued that Madame Montour was not Isabelle Couc, but rather her niece. According to this interpretation, Montour was born in an Indian village near modern Sorel, Quebec, around 1685, a year consistent with the story that she told Marshe. Her parents were Louis Montour, who was the brother of Isabelle Couc, and a Sokoki (Western Abenaki) woman named Madeleine. If Madame Montour was born in 1685, her birth apparently went unrecorded, and her first name is uncertain. It has been given as been Catherine, Elisabeth/Isabelle, and Madeleine.
Family.
If Madame Montour was Isabelle Couc, she led a colorful life before beginning her career as an interpreter for the British. In 1684, Couc married Joachim Germano, with whom she had at least one child. By the 1690s she was living in Michilimakinac with two of her sisters and their husbands, who worked as interpreters. Isabelle may also have worked as an interpreter for Sieur de Cadillac, the local French commander. Cadillac would later claim that Isabelle led a "dissolute life", and had more than one hundred male lovers. When Cadillac moved the French garrison to Fort Detroit in 1701, Isabelle evidently relocated there with her new husband, Pierre Tichenet. She became involved with Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont; when he deserted the fort in 1706, she fled with him.
Perhaps around 1708, Madame Montour married an Oneida war captain named Carondawana. (If Madame Montour was Isabelle Couc's niece, Carondawana was probably her only husband.) The couple had a son named Andrew Montour, who would become a well-known interpreter. Because Iroquois kinship terms were not exactly equivalent to European ones—a woman's niece might be described as her daughter, for example—there is some confusion about Madame Montour's other children. Another boy, Lewis Montour, was possibly her son, or perhaps her nephew. "French Margaret" Montour, a woman often described as Madame Montour's daughter, may have been her niece.
In the simplified family tree chart shown below, the names in green are the two women who have been identified as Madame Montour. Andrew Montour is connected on the chart to both of his potential mothers. Similarly, because it is uncertain if French Margaret was Madame Montour's daughter or niece, the chart illustrates both possibilities.
<br> 
Career in New York.
The first Montour to come to prominence was Louis Montour, who was Madame Montour's brother or father. Born Louis Couc, he adopted "Montour" as his surname in the 1680s. During King William's War (1689–1697), Montour and other Indians in Canada fought against British-allied Iroquois from the province of New York. It was at this time that an Iroquois raiding party may have captured his daughter, the woman who, according to some interpretations, became "Madame Montour".
Louis Montour relocated to Michilimakinac in the 1690s, where he worked as a fur trader. After King William's War ended, he began to facilitate trade between western Algonquians and merchants in Albany, New York. This lucrative enterprise diverted profits from New France to New York, and promoted diplomatic ties between the Iroquois and the western nations. Officials in New France saw this as a threat, and in 1709, during Queen Anne's War, Governor Vaudreuil had Montour assassinated.
After Louis Montour's murder, Madame Montour emerged as his successor. Although she evidently could not read or write, she was valuable as an interpreter, able to speak French, English, and several languages in both the Algonquian and Iroquoian families. She was also an ideal cultural intermediary, with family connections throughout the region. According to historian Jon Parmenter, Madame Montour's role as a "behind the scenes" consultant was even more important than her work as an interpreter. When Robert Hunter became governor of New York in 1710, Madame Montour became his personal interpreter and one of his most trusted advisers. Her husband Carondawana even took the name "Robert Hunter" to honor the governor.
Although Madame Montour served as an interpreter through the 1710s, there are few records of her activities at this time. In 1719, she petitioned New York for back pay, although with Governor Hunter's departure in 1720, she may not have received it. According to historian Alison Duncan Hirsch, the wording of an official recommendation about Montour's salary "has been misread to mean that she was asking to be paid the same as a man".
Life in Pennsylvania.
At some point, Madame Montour and her family migrated to the province of Pennsylvania. Exactly when and why she moved is unclear. She may have been traveling between New York and Pennsylvania as early as 1714, when her husband Carondawana was appointed as the Iroquois spokesman for the Shawnees living in Pennsylvania. By 1727, she and Carondawana were living at Ostonwakin, a village also known as Otstuagy or French Town. The site of previous Native American villages, Ostonwakin was located along the Great Shamokin Path, at the important confluence of Loyalsock Creek with the West Branch Susquehanna River, near the modern borough of Montoursville.
Because of her knowledge of Native American affairs, Montour's advice was sought by Pennsylvania officials and private traders. She first appears in the Pennsylvania historical record in July 1727 as an interpreter at a council in Philadelphia between Governor Patrick Gordon and an Iroquois group.
Madame Montour and Carondawana had a close relationship with Shikellamy, a noted Oneida diplomat who benefited from the couple's cultural and linguistic expertise. In 1729, Carondawana was killed fighting against the Catawbas, traditional foes of the Iroquois. After her husband's death, Madame Montour was gradually excluded from Pennsylvania diplomacy by Shikellamy and his associate Conrad Weiser, who wanted to keep tight control of the province's relationship with the Iroquois. After 1734, she no longer appeared at councils in an official capacity. She retired to her village, where she concentrated on raising her son Andrew Montour to be an interpreter and diplomat.
Madame Montour met several Moravian missionaries who were spreading the gospel throughout Pennsylvania during the 1740s. Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, bishop of the Moravian Church, visited Ostonwakin in 1742 on his journey to Onondaga, the Iroquois capital. He delivered a sermon in French, during which Madame Montour reportedly wept. Montour asked Zinzendorf to baptise two Indian children, but he declined, explaining that the Moravians did not perform baptisms in a village without first establishing a mission there. "She left me displeased", wrote Zinzendorf.
In 1744, Montour attended the treaty of Lancaster, where she told her story to Witham Marshe, as described above. Marshe, like others, got the impression that Montour was a white French woman captured by and raised among the Indians. Historian Alison Duncan Hirsch argued that the captivity story Montour told to Marshe was a fiction she created to reinvent herself.
By 1745, Madame Montour had left Ostonwakin and was living with Andrew on an island in the Susquehanna River near the Native village of Shamokin. In March 1746, Andrew took her west, across the Appalachian Mountains to Logstown on the Ohio River. She was reportedly going blind by that time. This was her last appearance in the historical record, aside from a brief statement made by trader John Harris in January 1753: "Madame Montour is dead." Exactly when and where she died is unknown.
Legacy.
Madame Montour has numerous descendants, and many Iroquois people still carry the Montour name. Montoursville, Pennsylvania, which was founded near the site of Ostonwakin, was named for her. Montour County, Pennsylvania, and Montour Falls, New York, are just two of the places named for her descendants and relatives.
Montour's role as interpreter and cultural go-between was continued by her son, Andrew Montour, who shared his mother's gift for languages. He worked as an interpreter for Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Sir William Johnson's Indian Department. Andrew Montour was appointed as a captain in George Washington's regiment at Fort Necessity during the French and Indian War. He was granted of land by Pennsylvania in the Montoursville area. He left Montoursville at some point and moved to what now is Juniata County before finally settling on Montour's Island in the Ohio River near Pittsburgh.
Madame Montour may have had another son, Lewis (or Louis) Montour, whose Indian name was apparently Tau-weson or Tan Weson. He may have been her nephew rather than her son. Little is known about him. He served as a messenger, and was reportedly killed in the French and Indian War.
Madame Montour's daughter or niece, Margaret, sometimes known as "French Margaret", became the leader of French Margaret's Town, an Indian settlement at the mouth of Lycoming Creek just a few miles up the West Branch Susquehanna River from Madame Montour's village. Margaret Montour's daughter Catharine Montour also became a noted local leader, and many 19th century historians confused her with Madame Montour.

John Taylor (trader)

John Taylor or Johnie Taylor (b. Freetown, Sierra Leone, d. March 12, 1898) was a Creole merchant based in Port Loko who killed during the Hut Tax War by Bai Bureh's war boys. Taylor was the only Creole who was murdered by Bai Bureh's war boys and his death was said to have been caused by his actions during the uprising.
Hut Tax War and death.
John Taylor moved from Freetown and established a store in Port Loko, Sierra Leone. Taylor was killed by Temne "war boys" mustered by Bai Bureh during the Hut Taxwar in 1898. The way boys found Taylor by releasing his pet monkey, which ran upstairs and revealed the location of where he was hiding in his house. Taylor's throat was then cut and he was chopped to pieces by the war boys. Taylor was killed because Bai Bureh's men believed he supported the British in their "hut tax" on all houses. Taylor was also accused of spying and providing information to District Commissioner Sharpe regarding the movement of Bai Bureh's men.
Family.
Taylor had a daughter called Susan who resided at Cline Town after her marriage. Taylor was married to Tabitha Mariah Taylor (the daughter of the catechist Charles S. Brown) and the couple had a daughter called Mary Petan Taylor. Mary was five years old when her father was killed in Port Loko.
