Good language learner studies

The good language learner (GLL) studies are a group of academic studies in the area of second language acquisition that deal with the strategies that good language learners exhibit. The rationale for the studies was that there is more benefit from studying the habits of successful language learners than there is from studying learners who fossilize at an early stage or stop studying altogether. It was thought that if the strategies of successful learners could be found then that knowledge could help learners who were not getting such good results.
The original studies were made in the 1970s, but petered out in the 1980s as researchers concentrated on individual learning strategies. However, some research on the topic has also been carried out in more recent years. The main body of GLL research investigated language learning in classroom situations. It found that good language learners could not be distinguished on the basis of observable behavior alone, although personality did seem to have an effect. It also found that teachers did not treat these learners differently from other students, although they could distinguish good language learners from learners who were not so effective.
Original studies.
The first studies in the good language learner tradition were made by Joan Rubin and David Stern, both of which were completed in 1975. Both of these studies proposed similar lists of strategies that good language learners use. On the basis of this, a large-scale study was performed at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) which investigated 34 language learners with good learning habits. This study found a list of six different strategies, which were similar to those proposed by Rubin and Stern:
Later work.
In spite of the flurry of interest in the GLL in the mid to late 70s, in the 80s and 90s interest moved more in the direction of socio/cultural influences and individual differences, as well as developing the concept of communicative competence into a communicative approach to language teaching.
In the new millennium, Norton and Toohey re-visited the GLL. Their new perspective emphasized the influence of situation, investment and identity on successful language learning.
Seven years later, Griffiths, harking back to Joan Rubin's original title, published "Lessons from Good Language Learners". Whereas the early work in the GLL field had tended to emphasize the role of strategies, Griffiths' work took a broader view and presented the GLL as a highly complex being involving many different variables, including motivation, age, style, personality, gender, metacognition, autonomy, beliefs, culture and aptitude. In addition, the target variables (including grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, function and skills) and some of the situational factors (including method and error correction practices) which learners must manage if they are to be successful were discussed.

Sofiane Sebihi

Sofiane Sebihi (born February 27, 1979 in Koléa) is an Algerian professional boxer. He is currently training in Geneva, Switzerland.
Personal.
Sebihi was born on February 27, 1979 in the town of Koléa, Tipaza, and grew up in Chiffalo Bou-Ismaïl.
Career.
Sebihi began boxing at the age of 7. He fought over 200 amateur fights in Algeria, including the Algerian championships, African civil and military championships and the World Military Championships in Ireland in 2002 (he lost by points against Russian champion Matvey Korobov, world military champion 2002 + 2003).
September 2003, Sebihi travelled to Switzerland for his professional fight against Sébastien Kialanda, October 1. Sebihi won the fight by knockout in the 5th round. Then he stayed in the country and started his European professional career from Geneva.
October 18, 2005, Sebihi surprised by winning the undefeated French light-heavyweight champion Jean-Louis Mandengue live on Eurosport. He shocked his opponent by a first violent knock out from the first round. During the second, Mandengue was sent spectacularly outside the ring. The fight went on until the 9th round when the French corner abandoned after two new k.o.'s 
February 25, 2011, Sebihi beats Vigan Mustafa by knockout in the 11th round and wins the IBF International light heavyweight title. Once again the terrific final knock out was seen live on TV (RaiSport 1): the Italian referee did not interrupt the action while Mustafa, still standing, was already groggy: Sebihi hit him three more times and Mustafa went on the ground, inanimate during some eternal minutes. The referee had to leave the hall of Florence under escort of 8 policemen... 
October 13, 2012, Sebihi went to Poland to fight for a WBC Silver Baltic title against Pawel Glazewski in the salt mine of Wieliczka (125 meters underground). The day before the fight, without a single explanation, the title WBC was cancelled. The fight would be maintained but judged only by polish judges. Sebihi decided to fight, hoping he would win by knock out. The evening came, Sebihi was clearly winning since the beginning while Glazewski was impeding the match by hanging on all the time (the referee never sanctioned him). The k.o. did not come and Sebihi absurdely and largely lost on the judges’scorecards (Wlodzimierz Gulc 92-99|Piotr Kozlowski 94-98|juge: Eugeniusz Tuszynski 91-100). It was live on the polish Canal+ Sport TV.

Harry H. Johnson

Harry Hubbard Johnson (11 April 1895 – 6 August 1987) was a United States army officer. He was born in Glenflora, Texas, six miles from his later hometown of Eagle Lake, Texas. He was the only son of Harry Stafford Johnson (September 17, 1873 Columbus, Texas - April 21, 1956 Eagle Lake, Texas) and Annie Bell Hubbard (Oct 14, 1873 Sealy, Texas - December 24, 1908 Eagle Lake, Texas). 
His mother Annie died in 1908 when he was 13. His father later married Mamie Eggar (January 28, 1891 Corpus Christie, Texas - January 2, 1962 Runge, Texas) on January 28, 1912. They had three children: Robert Ellen Johnson (1913 - October, 1916), Frank Marshall Johnson (February 15, 1915 - January 31, 1976), and Richard Wayne Johnson (November 11, 1917 - November 1, 1919).
World War I.
He attended Texas A&M College to study agriculture, but transferred to Tyler Community College after 2 years. He later graduated from Tyler with a degree in accounting in May, 1916. He attended the Officer Training Course at Leon Springs, Texas in May, 1917 and was assigned to the Aviation Ground School in Austin, Texas. When the call went out for recruits to fight in Europe, Johnson dropped out of flight school and enlisted in the Texas National Guard in August 10, 1917. 
Johnson was sent to Camp Bowie in Fort Worth, Texas on August 23, 1917, where he was made a Sergeant on September 7, 1917 with Company E, 141st Infantry, 36th Division. He was promoted to Second Lieutenant on December 2, 1917 and commissioned on December 28, 1917. He was transferred to Camp Bullis and was promoted to First Lieutenant on June 11, 1918. 
Johnson served with the 26th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division in France. He left France on August 23, 1919 on board the transport USS Marcia and arrived at Brooklyn, New York on September 2, 1919. He was Honorably Discharged on 16 October 1919 but failed to get a commission in the Officer's Reserve Corps.
Interwar Years.
On August 9, 1920 he was commissioned in the Texas National Guard as a first lieutenant in the 3rd Texas Cavalry. He also had a job as a commissary foreman for the Gulf Production company. In January 1921 he was promoted to Captain in the 56th Cavalry Brigade, Texas National Guard and worked as an oil salesman for Gulf. 
From 1929 to 1940 he served with the 124th Cavalry Regiment. In October 1941 he was given command of the 112th Cavalry Regiment.
World War II.
In 1941 - 1942 he commanded the 7th and 8th Cavalry Regiments, 2nd Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. In 1942 - 1943 he commanded the 56th Cavalry Brigade. In 1943 he was promoted to Brigadier General. In 1944 he was promoted to Major General and made commander of the all-black 2nd Cavalry Division, which was dismounted and performed various service and support functions in the North African Campaign from February, 1943 to May, 1944. On June 5, 1944, he was appointed by President Roosevelt as the Military Governor of Rome. From August 1944 to September 1945 he was made commander of the all-black 93rd Infantry Division which performed service and support tasks in the New Guinea-Philippines Campaign.
Postwar career.
Johnson worked as an executive for the Gulf Oil company after the war while remaining in the Army Reserve. 
He served as Director of the Hoof and Mouth Commission in the Republic of Mexico from 1946?-1951?. The joint Mexico-U.S. commission produced 5,500,000 doses of vaccine and vaccinated over 3,500,000 animals in August, 1949. 
Johnson retired from the Army Reserve in 1958.
Harry H. Johnson died on 6 Aug 1987 in Kerrville, Texas. He was buried on 11 Aug 1987 in Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, San Antonio, Texas.

Adieu (Stockhausen)

Adieu "für Wolfgang Sebastian Meyer" is a composition for wind quintet by Karlheinz Stockhausen composed in 1966. It is Number 21 in the composer's catalog of works, and the second of Stockhausen's three wind quintets.
History.
In June 1966 the oboist Wilhelm Meyer, who had frequently performed Stockhausen's earlier quintet "Zeitmaße" under the composer's direction, asked Stockhausen to compose a new wind quintet for an upcoming tour of Asia. Stockhausen initially demurred because a new quintet would probably take months to compose, and the current production of "Hymnen" in the Cologne electronic studio was taking up all of his time. A visit made a few days later to a comprehensive exhibition in The Hague of Piet Mondrian's paintings made Stockhausen ask himself, when confronted with Mondrian's well-known series of paintings titled simply "compositions"—with their strict organization by vertical and horizontal lines dividing the canvasses into rectangles—why it should be necessary to take months of concentrated work to produce a piece. Recalling also that Meyer's son Wolfgang Sebastian, an organist who not long before had asked Stockhausen to compose an organ piece, had been killed in a car crash on 10 January 1966, he immediately set to work on the new quintet in memory of the oboist's son, and completed it two days later. There were two unofficial performances, in Calcutta on 30 January and in Hong Kong on 6 February, before the "official premiere" on 10 February 1967 in Tokyo by the WDR Wind Quintet .
Analysis.
"Adieu" provokes reflection on the transience of experience by expressing feelings of separation and bereavement. This is accomplished through the use of long-held chords with microtonal fluctuations and gestures of interrupted movement—unfinished cadences, abrupt changes in the sound, and so on . "The musicians must be able to experience deeply, and form into notes, the sense of closeness to death that vibrates in this music" .
The work is divided into sections proportioned according to the Fibonacci numbers from 1 to 144. The main material consists of long-drawn out, static or slowly changing sound expanses, interrupted at intervals by general pauses and five short, unfinished traditional tonal cadences, reminiscent of Mozart . These broken-off cadence fragments open and close "Adieu", and divide the whole into four large sections of 144 time units each. The second and fourth of these main sections are subdivided by the pauses, resulting in a total of eight subsections, with durations of 144, 55 + 89, 144, and 34 + 21 + 34, + 55 units . These are then subdivided further into smaller measures. Each Fibonacci duration is associated throughout the composition with a particular articulation type. The value 13, for example, is associated with trills. However, when such a value is also a part of a larger one, e.g., when a section of 34 units is divided 13 + 21, the shorter section takes on in addition the character associated with 34, which is repetition of notes. On the other hand, where 13 combines with 8 to form a larger section of 21 units, the 13 bar will take on in addition to trills the character associated with 21, which is "crescendo" .

Data-intensive computing

Data-intensive computing is a class of parallel computing applications which use a data parallel approach to processing large volumes of data typically terabytes or petabytes in size and typically referred to as big data. Computing applications which devote most of their execution time to computational requirements are deemed compute-intensive, whereas computing applications which require large volumes of data and devote most of their processing time to I/O and manipulation of data are deemed data-intensive.
Introduction.
The rapid growth of the Internet and World Wide Web led to vast amounts of information available online. In addition, business and government organizations create large amounts of both structured and unstructured information which needs to be processed, analyzed, and linked. Vinton Cerf described this as an “information avalanche” and stated “we must harness the Internet’s energy before the information it has unleashed buries us”. An IDC white paper sponsored by EMC Corporation estimated the amount of information currently stored in a digital form in 2007 at 281 exabytes and the overall compound growth rate at 57% with information in organizations growing at even a faster rate. In a 2003 study of the so-called information explosion it was estimated that 95% of all current information exists in unstructured form with increased data processing requirements compared to structured information. The storing, managing, accessing, and processing of this vast amount of data represents a fundamental need and an immense challenge in order to satisfy needs to search, analyze, mine, and visualize this data as information. Data-intensive computing intended to address this need.
Parallel processing approaches can be generally classified as either "compute-intensive", or "data-intensive". Compute-intensive is used to describe application programs that are compute bound. Such applications devote most of their execution time to computational requirements as opposed to I/O, and typically require small volumes of data. Parallel processing of compute-intensive applications typically involves parallelizing individual algorithms within an application process, and decomposing the overall application process into separate tasks, which can then be executed in parallel on an appropriate computing platform to achieve overall higher performance than serial processing. In compute-intensive applications, multiple operations are performed simultaneously, with each operation addressing a particular part of the problem. This is often referred to as task parallelism.
Data-intensive is used to describe applications that are I/O bound or with a need to process large volumes of data. Such applications devote most of their processing time to I/O and movement and manipulation of data. Parallel processing of data-intensive applications typically involves partitioning or subdividing the data into multiple segments which can be processed independently using the same executable application program in parallel on an appropriate computing platform, then reassembling the results to produce the completed output data. The greater the aggregate distribution of the data, the more benefit there is in parallel processing of the data. Data-intensive processing requirements normally scale linearly according to the size of the data and are very amenable to straightforward parallelization. The fundamental challenges for data-intensive computing are managing and processing exponentially growing data volumes, significantly reducing associated data analysis cycles to support practical, timely applications, and developing new algorithms which can scale to search and process massive amounts of data. Researchers coined the term BORPS for "billions of records per second" to measure record processing speed in a way analogous to how the term MIPS applies to describe computers' processing speed.
Data-parallelism.
Computer system architectures which can support data parallel applications were promoted in the early 2000s for large-scale data processing requirements of data-intensive computing. Data-parallelism applied computation independently to each data item of a set of data, which allows the degree of parallelism to be scaled with the volume of data. The most important reason for developing data-parallel applications is the potential for scalable performance, and may result in several orders of magnitude performance improvement. The key issues with developing applications using data-parallelism are the choice of the algorithm, the strategy for data decomposition, load balancing on processing nodes, message passing communications between nodes, and the overall accuracy of the results. The development of a data parallel application can involve substantial programming complexity to define the problem in the context of available programming tools, and to address limitations of the target architecture. Information extraction from and indexing of Web documents is typical of data-intensive computing which can derive significant performance benefits from data parallel implementations since Web and other types of document collections can typically then be processed in parallel.
The US National Science Foundation (NSF) funded a research program from 2009 through 2010. Areas of focus were:
Pacific Northwest National Labs defined data-intensive computing as “capturing, managing, analyzing, and understanding data at volumes and rates that push the frontiers of current technologies”. 
Approach.
Data-intensive computing platforms typically use a parallel computing approach combining multiple processors and disks in large commodity computing clusters connected using high-speed communications switches and networks which allows the data to be partitioned among the available computing resources and processed independently to achieve performance and scalability based on the amount of data. A cluster can be defined as a type of parallel and distributed system, which consists of a collection of inter-connected stand-alone computers working together as a single integrated computing resource. This approach to parallel processing is often referred to as a “shared nothing” approach since each node consisting of processor, local memory, and disk resources shares nothing with other nodes in the cluster. In parallel computing this approach is considered suitable for data-intensive computing and problems which are “embarrassingly parallel”, i.e. where it is relatively easy to separate the problem into a number of parallel tasks and there is no dependency or communication required between the tasks other than overall management of the tasks. These types of data processing problems are inherently adaptable to various forms of distributed computing including clusters, data grids, and cloud computing.
Characteristics.
Several common characteristics of data-intensive computing systems distinguish them from other forms of computing:
(1) The principle of collection of the data and programs or algorithms is used to perform the computation. To achieve high performance in data-intensive computing, it is important to minimize the movement of data. This characteristic allows processing algorithms to execute on the nodes where the data resides reducing system overhead and increasing performance. Newer technologies such as InfiniBand allow data to be stored in a separate repository and provide performance comparable to collocated data.
(2) The programming model utilized. Data-intensive computing systems utilize a machine-independent approach in which applications are expressed in terms of high-level operations on data, and the runtime system transparently controls the scheduling, execution, load balancing, communications, and movement of programs and data across the distributed computing cluster. The programming abstraction and language tools allow the processing to be expressed in terms of data flows and transformations incorporating new dataflow programming languages and shared libraries of common data manipulation algorithms such as sorting.
(3) A focus on reliability and availability. Large-scale systems with hundreds or thousands of processing nodes are inherently more susceptible to hardware failures, communications errors, and software bugs. Data-intensive computing systems are designed to be fault resilient. This typically includes redundant copies of all data files on disk, storage of intermediate processing results on disk, automatic detection of node or processing failures, and selective re-computation of results.
(4) The inherent scalability of the underlying hardware and software architecture. Data-intensive computing systems can typically be scaled in a linear fashion to accommodate virtually any amount of data, or to meet time-critical performance requirements by simply adding additional processing nodes. The number of nodes and processing tasks assigned for a specific application can be variable or fixed depending on the hardware, software, communications, and distributed file system architecture.
System architectures.
A variety of system architectures have been implemented for data-intensive computing and large-scale data analysis applications including parallel and distributed relational database management systems which have been available to run on shared nothing clusters of processing nodes for more than two decades. 
However most data growth is with data in unstructured form and new processing paradigms with more flexible data models were needed. Several solutions have emerged including the MapReduce architecture pioneered by Google and now available in an open-source implementation called Hadoop used by Yahoo, Facebook, and others. LexisNexis Risk Solutions also developed and implemented a scalable platform for data-intensive computing which is used by LexisNexis.
MapReduce.
The MapReduce architecture and programming model pioneered by Google is an example of a modern systems architecture designed for data-intensive computing. The MapReduce architecture allows programmers to use a functional programming style to create a map function that processes a key-value pair associated with the input data to generate a set of intermediate key-value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Since the system automatically takes care of details like partitioning the input data, scheduling and executing tasks across a processing cluster, and managing the communications between nodes, programmers with no experience in parallel programming can easily use a large distributed processing environment.
The programming model for MapReduce architecture is a simple abstraction where the computation takes a set of input key-value pairs associated with the input data and produces a set of output key-value pairs. In the Map phase, the input data is partitioned into input splits and assigned to Map tasks associated with processing nodes in the cluster. The Map task typically executes on the same node containing its assigned partition of data in the cluster. These Map tasks perform user-specified computations on each input key-value pair from the partition of input data assigned to the task, and generates a set of intermediate results for each key. The shuffle and sort phase then takes the intermediate data generated by each Map task, sorts this data with intermediate data from other nodes, divides this data into regions to be processed by the reduce tasks, and distributes this data as needed to nodes where the Reduce tasks will execute. The Reduce tasks perform additional user-specified operations on the intermediate data possibly merging values associated with a key to a smaller set of values to produce the output data. For more complex data processing procedures, multiple MapReduce calls may be linked together in sequence.
Hadoop.
Apache Hadoop is an open source software project sponsored by The Apache Software Foundation which implements the MapReduce architecture. Hadoop now encompasses multiple subprojects in addition to the base core, MapReduce, and HDFS distributed filesystem. These additional subprojects provide enhanced application processing capabilities to the base Hadoop implementation and currently include Avro, Pig, HBase, ZooKeeper, Hive, and Chukwa. The Hadoop MapReduce architecture is functionally similar to the Google implementation except that the base programming language for Hadoop is Java instead of C++. The implementation is intended to execute on clusters of commodity processors.
Hadoop implements a distributed data processing scheduling and execution environment and framework for MapReduce jobs. Hadoop includes a distributed file system called HDFS which is analogous to GFS in the Google MapReduce implementation. The Hadoop execution environment supports additional distributed data processing capabilities which are designed to run using the Hadoop MapReduce architecture. These include HBase, a distributed column-oriented database which provides random access read/write capabilities; Hive which is a data warehouse system built on top of Hadoop that provides SQL-like query capabilities for data summarization, ad hoc queries, and analysis of large datasets; and Pig – a high-level data-flow programming language and execution framework for data-intensive computing.
Pig was developed at Yahoo! to provide a specific language notation for data analysis applications and to improve programmer productivity and reduce development cycles when using the Hadoop MapReduce environment. Pig programs are automatically translated into sequences of MapReduce programs if needed in the execution environment. Pig provides capabilities in the language for loading, storing, filtering, grouping, de-duplication, ordering, sorting, aggregation, and joining operations on the data.
HPCC.
HPCC (High-Performance Computing Cluster) was developed and implemented by LexisNexis Risk Solutions. The development of this computing platform began in 1999 and applications were in production by late 2000. The HPCC approach also utilizes commodity clusters of hardware running the Linux operating system. Custom system software and middleware components were developed and layered on the base Linux operating system to provide the execution environment and distributed filesystem support required for data-intensive computing. LexisNexis also implemented a new high-level language for data-intensive computing. 
The ECL programming language is a high-level, declarative, data-centric, implicitly parallel language that allows the programmer to define what the data processing result should be and the dataflows and transformations that are necessary to achieve the result. The ECL language includes extensive capabilities for data definition, filtering, data management, and data transformation, and provides an extensive set of built-in functions to operate on records in datasets which can include user-defined transformation functions. ECL programs are compiled into optimized C++ source code, which is subsequently compiled into executable code and distributed to the nodes of a processing cluster.
To address both batch and online aspects data-intensive computing applications, HPCC includes two distinct cluster environments, each of which can be optimized independently for its parallel data processing purpose. The Thor platform is a cluster whose purpose is to be a data refinery for processing of massive volumes of raw data for applications such as data cleansing and hygiene, extract, transform, load (ETL), record linking and entity resolution, large-scale ad hoc analysis of data, and creation of keyed data and indexes to support high-performance structured queries and data warehouse applications. A Thor system is similar in its hardware configuration, function, execution environment, filesystem, and capabilities to the Hadoop MapReduce platform, but provides higher performance in equivalent configurations. The Roxie platform provides an online high-performance structured query and analysis system or data warehouse delivering the parallel data access processing requirements of online applications through Web services interfaces supporting thousands of simultaneous queries and users with sub-second response times. A Roxie system is similar in its function and capabilities to Hadoop with HBase and Hive capabilities added, but provides an optimized execution environment and filesystem for high-performance online processing. Both Thor and Roxie systems utilize the same ECL programming language for implementing applications, increasing programmer productivity.

The Killing of Tupac Shakur

The Killing of Tupac Shakur is a biographical and true-crime account by American journalist and author Cathy Scott of the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur. The book made news upon its September 1997 release, on the first anniversary of Shakur's death, because of an autopsy photo included in its pages. It was the first book to be released covering the rapper's death. The book was reprinted in the UK by Plexus Publishing and in Poland by Kagra. Coverage of the autopsy photo, taken of Shakur's body on a gurney in the coroner's examining room, catapulted the book onto the "Los Angeles Times" bestseller list. New editions of the book were released in 2002 and 2014.
History.
Cathy Scott was employed as a reporter at the "Las Vegas Sun" when Tupac was gunned down on September 7, 1996, in a drive-by shooting near the Las Vegas Strip. She covered the case from the start and turned it into a book. The shooting occurred a few hours after the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon match, which Tupac and his music producer, Suge Knight, were in Las Vegas to attend. Tupac died from his injuries six days later. The killer has never been caught, although it is widely believed that Crips gang member Orlando Anderson, who was murdered 18 months later, was the shooter. Compton, California, police interviewed Anderson, but he was never charged.
Huntington Press released the book on the first anniversary of Shakur's death by issuing a 25,000-copy first printing, according to "Publishers Weekly".
Six months after the murder, "Unsolved Mysteries" covered the case, following Scott through a reenactment of the crime scene. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department declined to be at the studio to field calls and participate when the show aired, saying the publicity would not help their investigation.
"People" magazine covered the case in 2007 as one of "six haunting mysteries that continue to confound police." The article quotes Scott as saying, "The case is cold. The Crips (street gang) shot Tupac, but who was behind it?"
Autopsy photo.
Upon the book's release, the internal affairs bureau with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department launched an investigation into how the autopsy photo was released to the author. The investigation, which Scott has reported she did not participate in, ended 30 days later with no results. MTV News reported the week of the book's release that it "includes a grisly autopsy photo that should end all speculation as to whether the late rapper might still be alive," alluding to rumors that the star rapper and actor had faked his own death. Two years after the murder, "Los Angeles Magazine" featured a story by writer Heidi Seigmund Cuda focusing on rumors about Tupac "still living large" and described the autopsy photo as a "gruesome shot."
As much as $100,000 was offered for the photo by tabloids. Scott has not revealed her source.
In May 2014, a Wyclef Jean YouTube music video titled "April Showers" reignited the autopsy photo controversy when Scott lodged a copyright infringement complaint with YouTube because an image in the video was similar to the autopsy photo released in her book. YouTube banned the video. TMZ, which broke the story, reported that the video director, Hezues R', and Scott had settled the matter and agreed that Hezues R' would include a screen credit to the book at the end of the video.
East Coast-West Coast rap war.
A second updated edition of "The Killing of Tupac Shakur" was released in September 2002, which includes a chapter about rapper Biggie Smalls' death, with a third edition released in March 2014. Scott also wrote "The Murder of Biggie Smalls," about Notorious B.I.G., who was murdered six months later as an apparent result of a feud between Tupac and Biggie, onetime friends, in what has been called the East Coast – West Coast hip hop rivalry.
Reception.
The "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" featured the book in a November 1997 article, writing: "When "Las Vegas Sun" crime reporter Cathy Scott got a call to cover a murder in the summer of 1996, she had no idea it would take her on a fast-track trip into the world of rap music, blind witnesses and too many coincidences."
TruTV's "Crime Library" quoted the book as saying that, because of unreleased music potentially worth millions, Shakur "was worth more dead than alive."
"True Crime Zine" in July 2012 gave the book a five-star review.

Dependence logic

Dependence logic is a logical formalism, created by Jouko Väänänen, which adds "dependence atoms" to the language of first-order logic. A dependence atom is an expression of the form formula_1, where formula_2 are terms, and corresponds to the statement that the value of formula_3 is functionally dependent on the values of formula_4. 
Dependence logic is a logic of imperfect information, like branching quantifier logic or independence-friendly logic: in other words, its game theoretic semantics can be obtained from that of first-order logic by restricting the availability of information to the players, thus allowing for non-linearly ordered patterns of dependence and independence between variables. However, dependence logic differs from these logics in that it separates the notions of dependence and independence from the notion of quantification.
Syntax.
The syntax of dependence logic is an extension of that of first-order logic. For a fixed signature σ = ("S"func, "S"rel, ar), the set of all well-formed dependence logic formulas is defined according to the following rules:
Terms.
Terms in dependence logic are defined precisely as in first-order logic.
Atomic formulas.
There are three types of atomic formulas in dependence logic: 
Nothing else is an atomic formula of dependence logic. 
Relational and equality atoms are also called "first order atoms".
Complex formulas and sentences.
For a fixed signature σ, the set of all formulas formula_14 of dependence logic and their respective sets of free variables formula_15 are defined as follows: 
Nothing is a dependence logic formula unless it can be obtained through a finite number of applications of these four rules.
A formula formula_14 such that formula_30 is a "sentence" of dependence logic.
Conjunction and universal quantification.
In the above presentation of the syntax of dependence logic, conjunction and universal quantification are not treated as primitive operators; rather, they are defined in terms of disjunction and negation and existential quantification respectively, by means of De Morgan's Laws. 
Therefore, formula_31 is taken as a shorthand for formula_32, and formula_33 is taken as a shorthand for formula_34.
Semantics.
The "team semantics" for dependence logic is a variant of Wilfrid Hodges' compositional semantics for IF logic. There exist equivalent game-theoretic semantics for dependence logic, both in terms of imperfect information games and in terms of perfect information games.
Teams.
Let formula_35 be a first-order structure and let formula_36 be a finite set of variables. Then a team over formula_37 with domain formula_38 is a set of assignments over formula_37 with domain formula_38, that is, a set of functions formula_41 from formula_38 to formula_43.
It may be helpful to visualize such a team as a database relation with attributes formula_44 and with only one data type, corresponding to the domain formula_43 of the structure: for example, if the team formula_46 consists of four assignments formula_47 with domain formula_48 then one may represent it as the relation
Positive and negative satisfaction.
Team semantics can be defined in terms of two relations formula_49 and formula_50 between structures, teams and formulas. 
Given a structure formula_51, a team formula_52 over it and a dependence logic formula formula_14 whose free variables are contained in the domain of formula_54, if formula_55 we say that formula_46 is a "trump" for formula_14 in formula_37, and we write that formula_59; and analogously, if formula_60 we say that formula_46 is a "cotrump" for formula_14 in formula_37, and we write that formula_64.
If formula_59 one can also say that formula_14 is "positively satisfied" by formula_46 in formula_51, and if instead formula_64 one can say that formula_14 is "negatively satisfied" by formula_46 in formula_51.
The necessity of considering positive and negative satisfaction separately is a consequence of the fact that in dependence logic, as in the logic of branching quantifiers or in IF logic, the law of the excluded middle does not hold; alternatively, one may assume that all formulas are in negation normal form, using De Morgan's relations in order to define universal quantification and conjunction from existential quantification and disjunction respectively, and consider positive satisfaction alone. 
Given a sentence formula_14, we say that formula_14 is "true" in formula_37 if and only if formula_76, and we say that formula_14 is "false" in formula_37 if and only if formula_79.
Semantic rules.
As for the case of Alfred Tarski's satisfiability relation for first-order formulas, the positive and negative satisfiability relations of the team semantics for dependence logic are defined by structural induction over the formulas of the language. Since the negation operator interchanges positive and negative satisfiability, the two inductions corresponding to formula_80 and formula_81 need to be performed simultaneously:
Dependence logic and other logics.
Dependence logic and first-order logic.
Dependence logic is a conservative extension of first-order logic: in other words, for every first order sentence formula_14 and structure formula_149 we have that formula_76 if and only if formula_14 is true in formula_37 according to the usual first order semantics. Furthermore, for any first order "formula" formula_14, formula_154 if and only if all assignments formula_87 satisfy formula_14 in formula_37 according to the usual first order semantics.
However, dependence logic is strictly more expressive than first order logic: for example, the sentence 
is true in a model formula_51 if and only if the domain of this model is infinite, even though no first order formula formula_14 has this property.
Dependence logic and second-order logic.
Every dependence logic sentence is equivalent to some sentence in the existential fragment of second-order logic, that is, to some second-order sentence of the form 
where formula_162 does not contain second-order quantifiers. 
Conversely, every second-order sentence in the above form is equivalent to some dependence logic sentence.
As for open formulas, dependence logic corresponds to the downwards monotone fragment of existential second-order logic, in the sense that a nonempty class of teams is definable by a dependence logic formula if and only if the corresponding class of relations is downwards monotone and definable by an existential second-order formula.
Dependence logic and branching quantifiers.
Branching quantifiers are expressible in terms of dependence atoms: for example, the expression
is equivalent to the dependence logic sentence formula_164, in the sense that the former expression is true in a model if and only if the latter expression is true. 
Conversely, any dependence logic sentence is equivalent to some sentence in the logic of branching quantifiers, since all existential second-order sentences are expressible in branching quantifier logic.
Dependence logic and IF logic.
Any dependence logic sentence is logically equivalent to some IF logic sentence, and vice versa. 
However, the issue is subtler when it comes to open formulas. Translations between IF logic and dependence logic formulas, and vice versa, exist as long as the domain of the team is fixed: in other words, for all sets of variables formula_165 and all IF logic formulas formula_14 with free variables in formula_38 there exists a dependence logic formula formula_168 such that 
for all structures formula_51 and for all teams formula_46 with domain formula_172, and conversely, for every dependence logic formula formula_22 with free variables in formula_38 there exists an IF logic formula formula_175 such that 
for all structures formula_51 and for all teams formula_178 with domain formula_172. These translations cannot be compositional.
Properties.
Dependence logic formulas are "downwards closed": if formula_180 and formula_181 then formula_182. Furthermore, the empty team (but "not" the team containing the empty assignment) satisfies all formulas of Dependence Logic, both positively and negatively. 
The law of the excluded middle fails in dependence logic: for example, the formula formula_183 is neither positively nor negatively satisfied by the team formula_184. Furthermore, disjunction is not idempotent and does not distribute over conjunction. 
Both the compactness theorem and the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem are true for dependence logic. Craig's interpolation theorem also holds, but, due to the nature of negation in dependence logic, in a slightly modified formulation: if two dependence logic formulas formula_185 and formula_186 are "contradictory", that is, it is never the case that both formula_14 and formula_22 hold in the same model, then there exists a "first order" sentence formula_189 in the common language of the two sentences such that formula_14 implies formula_189 and formula_189 is contradictory with formula_22. 
As IF logic, Dependence logic can define its own truth operator: more precisely, there exists a formula formula_194 such that for every sentence formula_14 of dependence logic and all models formula_196 which satisfy Peano's axioms, if formula_197 is the Gödel number of formula_14 then 
This does not contradict Tarski's undefinability theorem, since the negation of dependence logic is not the usual contradictory one.
Complexity.
As a consequence of Fagin's theorem, the properties of finite structures definable in 
dependence logic correspond exactly to NP properties. Furthermore, Durand and Kontinen showed that restricting the number of universal quantifiers or the arity of dependence atoms in 
sentences gives rise to hierarchy theorems with respect to expressive power.
The inconsistency problem of dependence logic is semidecidable, and in fact equivalent to the inconsistency problem for first-order logic. 
However, the decision problem for dependence logic is non-arithmetical, and is in fact complete with respect to the formula_201 class of the Levy hierarchy.
Variants and extensions.
Team logic.
Team logic extends dependence logic with a "contradictory negation" formula_202. Its expressive power is equivalent to that of full second-order logic.
Modal dependence logic.
The dependence atom, or a suitable variant thereof, can be added to the language of modal logic, thus obtaining "modal dependence logic".
Intuitionistic dependence logic.
As it is, dependence logic lacks an implication. The "intuitionistic implication" formula_203, whose name derives from the similarity between its definition and that of the implication of intuitionistic logic, can be defined as follows:
Intuitionistic dependence logic, that is, dependence logic supplemented with the intuitionistic implication, is equivalent to second-order logic.
Independence logic.
Instead of dependence atoms, independence logic adds to the language of first-order logic independence atoms formula_208 where formula_209, formula_210 and formula_211 are tuples of terms. The semantics of these atoms is defined as follows:
Independence logic corresponds to existential second-order logic, in the sense that a non-empty class of teams is definable by an independence logic formula if and only if the corresponding class of relations is definable by an existential second-order formula. Therefore, on the level of open formulas, independence logic is strictly stronger in expressive power than dependence logic. However, on the level of sentences these logics are equivalent.
Inclusion/exclusion logic.
Inclusion/exclusion logic extends first-order logic with inclusion atoms formula_219 and exclusion atoms formula_220 where in both formulas formula_209 and formula_210 are term tuples of the same length. The semantics of these atoms is defined as follows:
Inclusion/exclusion logic has the same expressive power as independence logic, already on the level of open formulas. Inclusion logic and exclusion logic are obtained by adding only inclusion atoms or exclusion atoms to first-order logic, respectively. Inclusion logic sentences correspond in expressive power to greatest fixed-point logic sentences; hence inclusion logic captures (least) fixed-point logic on finite models, and PTIME over finite ordered models. Exclusion logic in turn corresponds to dependence logic in expressive power.
Generalized quantifiers.
Another way of extending dependence logic is to add some generalized quantifiers to the language of dependence logic. Very recently there has been some study of dependence logic with monotone generalized quantifiers and dependence logic with a certain majority quantifier, the latter leading to a new descriptive complexity characterization of the counting hierarchy.

History of the horse in Britain

The known history of the horse in Britain starts with horse remains found in Pakefield, Suffolk, dating from 700,000 BC, and in Boxgrove, West Sussex, dating from 500,000 BC. Early humans were active hunters of horses, and finds from the Ice Age have been recovered from many sites. At that time, land which now forms the British Isles was part of a peninsula attached to continental Europe by a low-lying area now known as "Doggerland," and land animals could migrate freely between what is now island Britain and continental Europe. The domestication of horses, and their use to pull vehicles, had begun in Britain by 2500 BC; by the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, British tribes could assemble armies which included thousands of chariots.
Horse improvement as a goal, and horse breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports and for the culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took over the role of horses in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all but disappeared from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.
Pleistocene epoch.
The earliest horse remains found in the area now covered by Britain and Ireland date to the Middle Pleistocene. Two species of horse have been identified from remains at Pakefield, East Anglia, dating back to 700,000 BC. Spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove, dated 500,000 BC, showed that early hominids were hunting horses in the area at that time. The land which now comprises the British Isles was periodically joined to continental Europe by a land bridge, extending from approximately the current coast of North Yorkshire to the English Channel, most recently until about 9,000 years ago. Dependent on the rise and fall of sea levels associated with advancing and retreating Ice ages, this allowed humans and fauna to migrate between these areas; as the climate fluctuated, hunters could follow their prey, including equids.
Although much of Britain from this time is now beneath the sea, remains have been discovered on land that show horses were present, and being hunted, in this period. Significant finds include a horse tooth dating from between 55,000 and 47,000 BC and horse bones dating from between 50,000 and 45,000 BC, recovered from Pin Hole Cave, in the Creswell Crags ravine in the North Midlands; further horse remains from the same era have been recovered from Kent's Cavern. In Robin Hood Cave, also in Creswell Crags, a horse tooth was recovered dating from between 32,000 to 24,000 BC; this cave has also preserved one of the earliest examples of prehistoric artwork in Britain – an engraving of a horse, on a piece of horse bone. A goddess figurine carved from horse bone and dating from around 23,000 BC has been recovered from Paviland Cave in South Wales.
Horse remains dating to the later part of this period – roughly coinciding with the end of the last glacial period – have been found at Farndon Fields, Nottinghamshire, dating from around 12,000 BC. Mother Grundy's Parlour, also in Creswell Crags, contains horse remains showing cut marks indicating that hunting of horses occurred there around 10,000 BC. A study of Victoria Cave in North Yorkshire produced a horse bone showing cut marks dating from about the same time.
Holocene period.
The Holocene period began around 11,700 years ago and continues to the present. Identified with the current warm period, known as "Marine Isotope Stage 1", or MIS 1, the Holocene is considered an interglacial period in the current Ice Age. Horse remains dating from the Mesolithic period, or Middle Stone Age, early in the Holocene, have been found in Britain, though much of Mesolithic Britain now lies under the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the English Channel, and material which may include archaeological evidence for the presence of the horse in Britain continues to be washed into the sea, by rivers and coastal erosion.
During the Devensian glaciation, the northernmost part of the peninsula from which Britain was formed was covered with glacial ice, and the sea level was about lower than it is today. This glacial ice advanced and retreated several times during this period, and much of what is now the North Sea and the English Channel was an expanse of low-lying tundra, which, around 12,000 BC, extended northwards to a point roughly parallel with Aberdeenshire, in eastern Scotland. In 1998, archaeologist B.J. Coles named this low-lying area "Doggerland", in which the River Thames flowed somewhat to the north of its current route, joining the Rhine to flow west to the Atlantic Ocean along the line of what is now the English Channel. Human hunters roamed this land, which, by about 8000 BC, had a varied coastline of lagoons, salt marshes, mudflats, beaches, inland streams, rivers, marshes, and included lakes. It may have been the richest hunting, fowling and fishing ground available to the people of Mesolithic Europe.
Horse remains dating from 10,500–8,000 BC have been recovered from Sewell's Cave, Flixton, Seamer Carr, Uxbridge and Thatcham. Remains dating from around 7,000 BC have been found in Gough's Cave in Cheddar.
Although there is an apparent absence of horse remains between 7000 BC and 3500 BC, there is evidence that wild horses remained in Britain after it became an island separate from Europe by about 5,500 BC. Pre-domestication wild horse bones have been found in Neolithic tombs of the Severn-Cotswold type, dating from around 3500 BC.
Domestication in pre-Roman times.
Domesticated horses were present in Bronze Age Britain from around 2000 BC. Bronze Age horse trappings including snaffle bits have been found which were used in harnessing horses to vehicles; Bronze Age cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255–815 BC, though these may have belonged to vehicles pulled by oxen. Early Bronze Age evidence for horses being ridden is lacking, though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but horses were ridden in battle in Britain by the late Bronze Age. Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500 BC.
Excavations of Iron Age sites have recovered horse bones from ritual pits at a temple site near Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, including one of a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack. The majority of Iron Age chariot burials in Britain are associated with the Arras culture, and in most cases the chariots were dismantled before burial. Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370 BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.
Towards the end of the Iron Age, there is much evidence for the use of horses in transport and battle, and for extensive trade between the inhabitants of Britain and other cultures. A collection of Iron Age artefacts from Polden Hill in Somerset includes a very large hoard of horse gear, and a rare, cast copper alloy cheekpiece dating from the late, pre-Roman Iron Age was found in St Ewe, Cornwall. The horse was an important figure in Bronze Age and Iron Age Celtic religion and myth, and is symbolised in the hill figure of the Uffington White Horse, near the Iron Age hill fort of Uffington Castle in Oxfordshire.
Roman Britain to the Norman Conquest.
By the time of Julius Caesar's attempted invasion of Britain in 55 BC, the inhabitants of Britain included proficient horsemen. Caesar's forces were met by British horsemen and war chariots, the chariots outfighting the Gaulish horsemen who had accompanied him. Caesar later faced organised resistance led by Cassivellaunus, with over 4,000 war chariots. To the east of the Pennines, the Romans also encountered the "Gabrantovici", or "horse-riding warriors." The spread and development of horse trappings recovered from this period, such as bits, strap junctions and terrets, have been used to indicate the withdrawal of ruling groups of Britons during the Roman conquest of Britain.
A large amount of horse dung has been found in a well at a Roman fort in Lancaster, Lancashire, which was a base for cavalry units in the 1st and 2nd centuries. The bones of 28 horses have been found in a Roman well at Dunstable, Bedfordshire, which was a Roman posting-station on Watling Street, where horses would have been kept. These horses had been butchered for horsemeat; but a revival of the cult of the Celtic goddess Epona, protector of horses, donkeys and mules, may account for horse carcasses buried whole at Dunstable, with "special care". Buried with humans in a 4th–5th century cemetery, these horses represent a belief that Epona protected the dead.
One of the earliest records of British horses being recognised for their quality and exported dates from the Roman era; many British horses were taken to Italy to improve native stock. Some of the earliest evidence of horses used for sport in Britain also dates from Roman times, a chariot-racing arena having been discovered at Colchester, in Essex.
From the 5th century, the role of the horse in Anglo-Saxon culture is partly illustrated by the number of words for "horse" in Old English. These distinguish between cart horses (two words), pack horses (two words), riding horses (three words), horses for breeding (three words, male and female), horses suitable for royalty and aristocracy (five words, of which three were mainly used in poetry), and warhorses (one word). There was no word for "plough horse," and no evidence that horses were used for ploughing in Anglo-Saxon times, when this was still done by ox teams; but Domesday Book records a horse used for harrowing, in 1086. Horses were used predominantly for transporting goods and people; numerous English place-names, such as Stadhampton, Stoodleigh and Studham, refer to the keeping of "studs", in this case "herds", of horses; and Anglo-Saxon stirrups and spurs have been found by archaeologists. Horses were also raced for sport, and a "race-course" in Kent is mentioned in a charter of King Eadred, dated 949.
There is some evidence that horses were occasionally eaten, perhaps in a hard winter, or ridden until five years of age and then slaughtered for meat; but there are many references in medieval sources indicating that the Anglo-Saxons placed a high value on horses. They were often included in the price paid for land and in bequests and other gifts, and kings' servants included horse-thegns, or marshals. Numerous horses and horse-breeding establishments were recorded in Domesday Book, though many more horses were probably omitted, given the need for horses for riding and pulling carts. Only 71 smiths are recorded in Domesday Book, but others "must be concealed under the heading of other classes." Six smiths in Hereford were obliged to supply 120 horseshoes each year for the maintenance of horses belonging to warriors.
Horses held religious significance in Anglo-Saxon paganism. The 8th century historian Bede, of Jarrow, in Northumbria, wrote that the first Anglo-Saxon chieftains, in the 5th century, were Hengist and Horsa – Old English words for "stallion" and "horse", respectively. Modern scholars regard Hengist and Horsa as horse deities venerated by pagan Anglo-Saxons, euhemerised into ancestors of Anglo-Saxon royalty, and stemming from the divine twins of Proto-Indo-European religion, with cognates in various other Indo-European cultures.
Horses appear frequently in accounts concerning miraculous events in the context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped at the edge of a cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.
Although there is reference to Viking horsemen fighting in the 10th century Battle of Sulcoit, in Ireland, their primary use for horses in Britain – some of which they captured or seized, and some of which they brought with them – was to facilitate rapid travel. This is a central purpose for which horses were used in Anglo-Saxon England, particularly in warfare, since conflict between the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms was carried out over long distances. In the 7th century, King Penda of Mercia, in central England, took his armies north to Bamburgh, nearly north of Hadrian's Wall; and Oswald of Northumbria was killed fighting the Mercians in Shropshire. These armies probably rode horses to war, and the maintenance of horses was required of many, or perhaps all, who held land under Anglo-Saxon kings. In the 7th century, an Anglo-Saxon warrior was buried with his horse at Sutton Hoo; carvings on Anglo-Saxon stone crosses feature warriors on horseback; and 62 "warhorses" are recorded in Domesday Book. In the 11th century, Anglo-Saxon warriors on horseback fought successfully against Viking, Welsh and Scottish armies, the latter including Norman allies.
Duke William of Normandy shipped horses across the English Channel when he invaded England in 1066, and the outcome of the subsequent Battle of Hastings has been described as "the inevitable victory of stirruped cavalry over helpless infantry". The Battle of Hastings took place in King Harold of England's former earldom, at the centre of his property and connections; but it came less than three weeks after he had taken an army north and defeated Norwegian invaders, under King Harald Hardrada, at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, near York. Harold of England had then been "strong in cavalry". However, that battle had seriously depleted the English king's resources in the south, and, although he re-inforced his army in London on his way to meet the Norman invaders, the force which he brought to the Battle of Hastings was smaller than that which fought at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. No English cavalry was deployed:
Although these mounted troops have been described as cavalry, their weapons and armour were similar to those of foot soldiers, and they did not fight as an organised group in the way that cavalries are normally understood to have done.
Medieval period to the Industrial Age.
The improvement of horses for various purposes began in earnest during the Middle Ages. King Alexander I of Scotland (c. 1078 – 1124) imported two horses of Eastern origin into Britain, in the first documented import of oriental horses. King John of England (1199–1216) imported 100 Flemish stallions to continue the improvement of the "great horse" for tournament and breeding. At the coronation of Edward I of England and his queen Eleanor of Castile in 1274, royal and aristocratic guests gave away hundreds of their own horses, to whoever could catch them.
King Edward III of England (1312 – 1377) imported 50 Spanish stallions, and three "great horses" from France. He was a passionate supporter of hunting, the tournament, and horse racing, in which Spanish horses known as "running horses" were then primarily involved.
Horse ownership was widespread by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords were involved in the harrowing of land for arable crops in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses for this work. Horses and carts were increasingly used for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport such items in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all their farm work. The necessity for carting produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as an enterprise continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80 broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.
The introduction of the horse-drawn, four-wheeled wagon in Britain, by the early 15th century at the latest, meant that much heavier loads could be hauled, but brought with it the necessity for horse teams capable of hauling those heavier loads over the poor roads of the time. Where loads were suitable, and the ground was exceptionally poor, pack horses had an advantage over wagons as they needed fewer handlers, were faster, and could travel over much rougher ground. By that time, post-horses were available for general hire in post-stage towns on principal routes in England. These were used by royal messengers with warrants from the Privy Council to hire horses at half price, but they would be delayed if all available horses were already engaged. In 1482, while in Scotland, King Edward IV established a temporary relay of riders between London and Berwick-upon-Tweed, which allowed messages to be transmitted within two days, and appears to have imitated a system used by Louis XI of France. London merchants established a private post-horse system for correspondence with Calais, France, in 1496. Henry VIII appointed the first British Master of the Post in 1512: he established local postmasters, whose post-boys would carry royal mail from one stage to the next on horseback, in a system which "combined elements of several European models".
By the early 16th century, horse teams were beginning to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, had been used in western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.
During the Hundred Years War of the 14th–15th centuries, the English government banned the export of horses in times of crisis; in the 16th century, Henry VII passed a number of laws relating to the breeding and export of horses in an attempt to improve the British stock, under which it was forbidden to allow uncastrated male horses to be turned out in fields or on common land; they had to be "kept within bounds and tied in stalls." This ruling caused inconvenience, and the practice of gelding horses became widespread. In 1535, Henry VIII passed the Breed of Horses Act aimed at improving the height and strength of horses; no stallion under and no mare under 13 hands (52 inches, 132 cm) was permitted to run out on common land, or to run wild, and no two-year-old colt under 11.2 hands (46 inches, 117 cm) was allowed to run out in any area with mares. Annual round-ups on common land were enforced, and any stallion under the height limit was ordered to be destroyed, along with "all unlikely horses whether mares or foals." Henry VIII also established a stud for breeding imported horses such as the Spanish Jennet, Neapolitan coursers, Irish Hobbies, Flemish "roiles", or draught horses, and Scottish "nags", or riding horses. However, it was reported in 1577 that this had "little effect"; soon after, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Nicholas Arnold was said to have bred "the best horses in England".
During the successive reigns of queens Mary I and Elizabeth I, laws were introduced with the aim of reducing horse theft, requiring all sale transactions of horses to be recorded. Laws calling for swingeing culls of "under-height" horses were partially repealed by Elizabeth I in 1566. Areas of poor quality land could not support the weight of horses desired by Henry VIII, and were exempted because of "their rottenness ... are not able to breed beare and bring forth such great breeds of [stallions as by the statute of 32 Henry VIII is expressed, without peril of miring and perishing of them". This allowed many of Britain's mountain and moorland pony breeds to escape slaughter. Human population expansion in Britain during the reign of Elizabeth, and the resulting necessity for improvements in transport, increased the demand for good horses. Horse transport was so extensive at the time that on one morning alone 2,200 horses were counted on the road between Shoreditch, just north of the city of London, and Enfield, about further north.
During the Tudor and Stuart periods, horse ownership was more widespread in Britain than in continental Europe, but it suffered a decline in the harsh economic environment of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With economic recovery, the number of horse owners increased again. Travel became more popular, along with the hiring of horses, although a common practice at the time was for a traveller to buy a horse for a journey, and then sell it on arrival at his destination. Horses had been raced in Britain for hundreds of years by the time of King James VI of Scotland (1567 – 1625), but he brought the sport as it is known today into England from Scotland while he was king of both countries (1603 – 1625); he organised public races in a number of places, and continued to import quality animals aimed at the development of a new, lighter, faster type of horse.
When Gervase Markham published his "Cavalarice, or the English Horseman" in 1617, farmers were not only using pack horses, farm horses and cart horses, but were also breeding horses for saddling and driving. Markham recommended crossing native horses with other breeds for particular purposes, for example suggesting Turks or Irish Hobbies as an outcross to produce riding animals, Friesland and Flanders horses to produce light driving animals, and German heavy draught horses to produce heavy haulage animals. Horse fairs were numerous, and some of the earliest mentions of specific breeds, such as Cleveland horses and Suffolk Punch horses, date from this time. Large Dutch horses were imported by King William III (1650 – 1702) when he discovered that existing cart horses did not have the strength for the task of draining the Fens. These horses became known as Lincolnshire Blacks, and the English heavy draught horses of today are their descendants. By the middle of the 17th century, the reputation of the British horse throughout Europe had become so good that, according to Sir Jonas Moore in 1703, "since the peace treaty with France, farmers had been offered by Frenchmen three times the accustomed price for their horses".
During the reign of Charles I (1625 – 1649), passion for racing and racehorses, and for swift horses for the hunting field, became the focus of horse breeding to the point that there was a dearth of the heavier horses used in tournament and for warfare. This led to complaints, as there was still a need for stronger, more powerful types of horse. The English Civil War, from 1642 to 1651, disrupted horse racing; Oliver Cromwell banned horse racing and ordered that all race horses and spectators at such an event should be seized. He concentrated on the breeding of animals suited as cavalry horses, by encouraging crossbreeding of lightweight racing horses with the heavier working horses, and effectively produced a new type of horse altogether in the warmblood. The export of any horse other than geldings was prohibited, and the ending of the war resulted in hardship for horse breeders, as demand for their horses was significantly reduced; but an illicit trade in horses flourished with wealthier Europeans, who wanted to buy from the vastly-improved British stock. It was not until 1656 that legislation removed the restrictions on horses for export. With the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the breeding of quality horses was begun again "from scratch".
Horse-powered agricultural implements were improved during this period. By 1600, a lighter plough which could be drawn by two horses, the "Dutch plough", was used in eastern England; this was followed in 1730 by the lightweight Rotherham plough, an unwheeled, or "swing" plough. It was advertised as reducing ploughing times by a third, or using a third less horsepower for the same ploughing time. The improved seed drill and horse-hoe were invented by Jethro Tull in 1731; but it took more than 100 years for these designs to come into common use. The earliest horse-powered threshing machines, which were installed permanently in barns, were developed towards the end of the 18th century.
The use of fast horse-drawn coaches, known as 'Flying Coaches', began in 1669. Travelling between London and Oxford by coach had involved an overnight stay at Beaconsfield, but Oxford University organised a project to allow completion of the journey between sunrise and sunset. The project succeeded, and was quickly copied by Cambridge University; by the end of Charles II's reign, in 1685, Flying Coaches ran three times a week from London to all major towns, in good conditions covering a distance of around fifty miles in a day. The Thoroughbred horse was developed from about this time, with native mares being crossbred to Arab, Turk and Barb horses to produce excellent racehorses; the "General Stud Book", giving clear and detailed pedigrees, was first published in the 1790s, and the lineage of today's Thoroughbred horses can be traced with great accuracy to 1791. Horses running in races sponsored by the monarchy then carried weights of around , more than the usual weight of 8–10 stone (51–64 kg), indicating that horse racing, hunting and chasing partly originated in a need for military training.
The Mail coach service began towards the end of the 18th century, adding to the existing use of fast coaches. The horses required for fast coaches were mainly produced by outcrossing heavy farm mares to the lighter racing type of horse, as a combination of speed, agility, endurance and strength was required. While the aristocracy and gentry paid high prices for matched teams of quality horses, farmers sold the best of their animals at a good profit, keeping lower-quality animals for themselves, or for sale as saddle horses. The coaching trade grew from the trade in carriage of goods; some public transport was provided by farmers, who could keep large numbers of horses on their own farms more cheaply than those who had to buy in food and forage. However, proprietors of coaching inns accounted for most of the trade. In many cases a proprietor would work his horse teams only in his local district, but some owned many coaching establishments, and could provide transport over much greater distances. An advantage to proprietors of a string of coaching inns was that passengers on their coaches also used and paid for the services offered by their inns, often including overnight accommodation. Some inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses.
19th and 20th centuries.
Horses remained the primary source of power for agriculture, mining, transport and warfare, until the arrival of the steam engine. The Middleton Railway had been established for industrial use by an Act of Parliament in 1785; Parliament also allowed the construction of the Surrey Iron Railway, intended to carry goods, in 1801, and the Oystermouth Railway, later known as the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, in 1804. These initially used horse-drawn vehicles, but developments in steam engines made them cheaper to run than horses, and more useful as a source of locomotive power on railways. The Swansea and Mumbles Railway was the first to carry paying passengers, from 1807, and was soon followed by many others, with Parliament passing around one new railway Act per year until 1821. By 1840, numerous railway lines had been laid, forming networks such as that created by George Hudson; the number of rail miles expanded from 1,497 in 1840 to 6,084 by 1850, and horse-drawn passenger coaches became virtually obsolete over long distances.
Use of the steam engine also began to make the horse redundant in farm work. In a letter to "The Farmer's Magazine" in 1849, Alderman Kell of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, commented that "... has been said, although perhaps not mathematically correct, to show that horses are kept at vast expense in comparison with a steam engine that eats only when it works." With the invention of the portable steam engine in the 1840s, which was promoted by the Royal Agricultural Society, steam-powered machines could be used on small farms. One man could invest in a portable machine, and recoup the cost by hiring it out for haymaking and harvest; the only use for horses here was to move the machine from one place to another. There were about 3.3 million horses in late Victorian Britain. In 1900 about a million of these were working horses, but by 1914 this number had dropped to between 20,000 and 25,000.
Horses and ponies began to be used in Britain's mining pits in the 18th century, to haul "tubs" of coal and ore from the working face to the lifts, in deep mines, or to the surface in shallower mines. Many of these ponies were Shetlands, as their small size was combined with great strength. A stud farm for the sole purpose of breeding ponies for the pits was established in 1870 by colliery owner Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry, and the Shetland Pony Stud Book Society was formed in 1890 to stop the use of the best stallions in the pits. By 1984, only 55 pit ponies were being used by the National Coal Board in Britain, chiefly at the modern pit in Ellington, Northumberland. A horse called "Robbie", probably the last to work underground in a British coal mine, was retired from a mine at Pant y Gasseg, near Pontypool, in May 1999.
In the First World War, horses were used in combat for cavalry charges, and they remained the best means for moving scouts, messengers, supply wagons, ambulances, and artillery quickly on the battlefield; the horse could refuel itself to some extent by grazing, and could cope with terrain which was beyond machines of the time. However, this war had a devastating effect on the British horse population. As thousands of animals were drafted for the war effort, some breeds were so reduced in number that they were in danger of disappearing. Many breeds were saved by the dedicated efforts of a few breeders who formed breed societies, tracking down remaining animals and registering them.
21st century.
Working horses all but disappeared from Britain's streets by the 21st century; among few exceptions are heavy horses pulling brewers' wagons, or drays. However, when Young's Brewery ceased brewing in Wandsworth, London, in 2006, it ended more than 300 years' use of dray horses by the brewery: its team of Shire horses was retired from delivery work and given a new career with the head horsekeeper, offering heavy horse team driving as a recreational event, although they continue to appear at opening ceremonies for new Young's pubs and other publicity events.
There are still working brewery horses in other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire horses in Devizes, Wiltshire, but working teams are becoming increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to round up thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use horses in crowd control, but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice to advanced on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy for the disabled, and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.

Miss You Nights

"Miss You Nights" is a song written by Dave Townsend and made famous worldwide by Cliff Richard. The song has been recorded by numerous other artists, most notably Westlife, who released it as the second track on a double A-side single in 2003. The Westlife single reached number 3 in the UK singles chart.
Background.
Townsend wrote the song in 1974 while his girlfriend was away on holiday. He recorded it on an album for Island Records, but the label shelved the album and decided to recoup part of the cost of the unreleased album through cover deals. Some demo tapes were handed to Bruce Welch of The Shadows who also worked as producer for Cliff Richard and was looking for songs to revitalize his career. Welch immediately recognized it as a hit - "Andrew Powell's string arrangement helped to make it a great love song through its imagery and potent feelings of longing and loneliness". Welch and Cliff recorded it in September 1975. Of the song and its writer Cliff said: "I think it's one of the nicest songs I’ve ever made... when I heard his version it was terrific. He was pleased to have that happen. I mean it could have been anybody and it would have been a hit."
Original Release.
Cliff Richard released "Miss You Nights" on 14 November 1975 as the lead single from his studio album "I'm Nearly Famous". It entered the British Top 20 and in early 1976, reached #15 in the UK Singles Chart. Despite not reaching a high chart position, it has become an enduring favourite of Richard's fans. For example, in 2006 
UK BBC Radio 2 listeners voted it their favourite Cliff Richard song of all time.
"Miss You Nights" was first included on Richard's 1976 studio album "I'm Nearly Famous". As one of Richard's most enduring songs, it has been included on many of his compilation albums. The most notable of these compilation albums and albums with alternative versions are:
Cliff Richard 1994 Re-release.
In 1994, Cliff Richard re-released the song on a double A-side single with "All I Have To Do Is Dream", which was listed first. "All I Have to Do Is Dream", originally by The Everly Brothers was recorded as a live duet with Phil Everly, while "Miss You Nights" is a remix of the 1976 original. The double A-side single reached #14 in the UK singles chart.

John Bernard O'Hara became a partner in 1889 and became sole proprietor in 1893-4. In his hands it became a leading private school in Victoria. During a period of eight years, of 28 first-class honours gained by all the schools of Victoria in physics and chemistry, 14 were obtained by pupils from South Melbourne College. O'Hara was an inspiring teacher, and many of his pupils went on to hold distinguished positions in the universities of Australia.
From 1905, the school was located at 76 Kerferd Rd, South Melbourne.
O'Hara closed the school in 1917 due to ill health.

Eugene Onegin (film)

Eugene Onegin (Russian: Евгений Онегин, translit: Yevgeni Onegin) is 1958 Soviet opera film, produced by Lenfilm Studio, directed by Roman Tikhomirov, starring Vadim Medvedev, Igor Ozerov and Ariadna Shengelaya.
The film is a screen version of the famous opera "Eugene Onegin" by Pyotr Tchaikovsky based on the novel in verse by Alexander Pushkin.
The principal solo parts were performed by notable opera singers of the Bolshoi Theatre.
Musical manager and conductor - Boris Khaykin.
Plot.
Eugene Onegin, a jaded young dandy from the big city of St. Petersburg, travels to the country to ingratiate himself into the affection of a dying uncle. There he meets the idealistic and romantic poet Vladimir Lensky, who introduces him to the daughters of a local landowner: Olga, with whom Lensky has strong affections, and Olga's younger sister Tatyana. Tatyana falls in love with Onegin. She writes him a letter pledging her love to him and telling him that she "is his." But Onegin rejects her in a polite, but cold and condescending sermon. Instead, angered by Lensky's dragging him to Tatyana's nameday party, he asks Olga to dance and flirts with her, much to Lensky's displeasure. Lensky challenges his friend to a duel with pistols. Seconds are appointed and, opportunities for reconciliation scorned, the duel takes place. Onegin kills Lensky and leaves the country estates to take a distant military assignment. Tatyana has disturbed dreams of Onegin and visits his uncle's estate to scan the books that he was reading so as to judge his character.
Several years pass, and the scene changes to St. Petersburg, to which Onegin has come to attend the most prominent balls and interact with the leaders of old Russian society. He sees the most beautiful woman, who now captures the attention of all and is central to society's whirl, and realizes that it is that same Tatyana whose love he had once turned away. Now she is married to an aged general. At first Tatyana pretends that she does not recognize the now mature Onegin, but then treats him with politeness, but coolly. But he writes to her passionately now and asks to see her in private, away from her husband, with whom he briefly speaks. At last he contrives to stand in her presence away from others eyes and presents to her the opportunity to renew their past love.But she rejects him in a speech, mirroring his earlier sermon, where she admits both:her love for him and the absolute loyalty that she nevertheless has for her husband.

History.
Peacock was established in 2007 by the merger of NBC News Productions, NBC Media Productions, along with the staff of NBC's newsmagazine "Dateline". The merger came in response to the growing popularity of non-fiction programming on television (with a particular emphasis on cable channels and digital outlets), and in the wake of a recent series of budget cuts at NBC Universal that affected NBC News's long-form production units
In May 2012, Marc Victor was placed in charged of the newly formed TOMORROW production division of Peacock.

Danny Zialcita

Danny Zialcita (November 24, 1939–March 10, 2013) was a Filipino movie director, writer and producer. 
Early Life.
Danilo Zialcita was born November 24, 1940, in Manila. During his long career where he made 52 films as director, 22 of which he wrote either the story or screenplay or both, Zialcita has explored various genres that included action, drama, suspense and comedy. 
Personal Life.
He was married to Leonor Vergara with 2 children: Elizabeth and Michael Zialcita. 
Career.
Some of his films are "Kapag tumabang ang asin" (1976), "Mga basag na kristal" (1977), "Anak sa una, kasal sa ina" (1978), "Parolado" (1979), "Tatlong bulaklak" (1979), "Nagalit ang buwan sa haba ng gabi" (1983) and "May lamok sa loob ng kulambo" (1984). Zialcita made his directorial debut with "Lady Killer" (1965), starring the suave Romano Castellvi in the title role.
Although he is perhaps best known for "Dear Heart" (1981), the very first team-up of heartthrobs Sharon Cuneta and Gabby Concepcion, Zialcita had churned out several outstanding dramas way before 1981. These include "Palos Strikes Again" (1968), with Bernard Bonnin (the original "Palos" star), with whom he worked again in "Bart Salamanca" (1968) of the same year; films of the "bomba" genre like "Gutom" (1970) starring Rossana Marquez and "Hidhid" (1971) starring Rosanna Ortiz and Annabelle Rama; adult dramas like "Lakaki, babae kami" (1977), with Pinky de Leon, Chanda Romero, Janet Bordon, Alona Alegre, George Estregan, Eddie Garcia, Raoul Aragonn and Tommy Abuel; "Hindi sa iyo ang mundo, Baby Porcuna" (1978), topbilled by Beth Bautista, with Joseph Sytangco, Dick Israel, Anthony Alonzo, Josephine Garcia, Suzanne Gonzales; "Ikaw at ang gabi" (1979) with Dindo Fernando, Chanda Romero, Ronaldo Valdez and Beth Bautista; "Kaladkarin" (1980) with Jean Saburit in her first lead role, supported by Eddie Garcia, Suzanne Gonzales and George Estregan; and "Langis at tubig" (1980) with Vilma Santos, Dindo Fernando, Amy Austria, Ruben Rustia, Greg Lozano, Suzanne Gonzales, George Estregan, Ronaldo Valdez and Vic Silayan.
He was also noted for homosexual-themed fare like "Si malakas si maganda at si mahinhin" (1980), starring Elizabeth Oropesa, Alma Moreno, Dindo Fernando, George Estregan, Rudy Fernandez, Leonor Vergara, Mario Escudero and Mary Walter; "Mahinhin vs. mahinhin" (1981) with Dindo Fernando and Ronaldo Valdez in drag, costarring Edu Manzano, Carmi Martin, Dante Rivero and Pinky de Leon; "Lalakwe" (1985) starring Ronaldo Valdez, with Gloria Diaz, Rio Locsin, Tommy Abuel, Lyka Ugarte, Chanda Romero, Michael de Mesa, Eddie Arenas, Odette Khan, Lucita Soriano, Virginia Montes and Suzanne Gonzales; and the controversial cult classic "T-Bird at ako" (1982), considered the landmark team-up of ultimate rivals Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos. Where in the hand of a lesser auteur the portrayal of gay people, transvestites, bisexuals and the like would be stereotyped caricatures, Zialcita directed such fare with class and panache.
Timely with today's proliferation of video scandals, Zialcita directed, seemingly with foresight about society's voyeuristic tendencies, "The Betamax Story" (1981), starring Vilma Santos, with Pinky de Leon, Cherie Gil, Alma Moreno, Jean Saburit, Chichay, Elizabeth Oropesa, George Estregan and Beth Bautista. He was also famous for films with kilometric and naughty titles; witness "Nang masugatan ang gabi" (1984), "Hawakan mo at pigilan ang kanahon" (1984), "May daga sa labas ng lungga" (1984), "Menudo at pandesal" (1985) starring Gloria Diaz, Carmi Martin, Tanya Gomez, Janice de Belen, Paquito Diaz, Max Alvarado, Lou Veloso and Caridad Sanchez; "Bakit manipis ang ulap" (1985) with Chanda Romero, Laurice Guillen, Tommy Abuel, Mark Gil and Janice de Belen; and "Bakit madalas ang tibok ng puso?" (1986), featuring the then-popular love team of Aga Muhlach and Janice de Belen, costarring Dante Rivero, Liza Lorena, Laurice Guillen, Anita Linda, Isabel Granada, Odette Khan, Johnny Vicar and Joonee Gamboa. Zialcita would go on to direct Cuneta for the second and last time in "To Love Again" (1983) (the title based on the famous Hollywood song), which also marked the film debut of the late Miguel Rodriguez. He worked a second time with Concepcion in what would turn out to be his swan song, "Bakit iisa ang pag-ibig" (1987), which also starred Snooky Serna.
Historians, film critics and the stars themselves attested that Zialcita liked his movie characters well-dressed, and the term "glossy melodrama" was famously coined for him in the 1980s. While Brocka's films chronicled poverty, squalor and struggle, Zialcita's movies were often about the well-heeled and their neuroses and quirks. His leading ladies often wore outlandish dresses and beautiful hats for scenes that would become the "Zialcita trademark."
Plans were afoot for Zialcita to direct again, before his untimely demise in March of this year. In a 2009 interview with Jerome Gomez for Metro Him magazine of ABS-CBN Publishing, Zialcita was all set to reprise "Dear Heart" (1981) (maybe with new actors), and he wanted to direct Sharon Cuneta and daughter KC Concepcion together, probably with John Lloyd Cruz as Concepcion's love interest. Zialcita and Gabby Concepcion's father were also touching base to develop a film for Gabby, in the vein of "The Thorn Birds" (1983 American TV mini-series).
Zialcita received the Best Screenplay award from the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) for his collaboration with Tom Adrales on "Gaano kadalas ang minsan?" (1982). He was cited by the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) for Best Story, for "Langis at tubig" (1980). He was nominated by URIAN twice for screenplay and direction, for "Hindi sa iyo ang mundo, Baby Porcuna" (1978) and "Ikaw at ang gabi" (1979). The FAMAS nominated him four times as best director, "Hindi sa iyo ang mundo, Baby Porcuna" (1978), "Langis at tubig" (1980), "Gaano kadalas ang minsan?" (1982) and "Bakit manipis ang ulap" (1985), and once as Best Scriptwriter for "Nang masugatan ang gabi" (1984).
Death.
Danny Zialcita died at the age of 73 on March 10, 2013 after suffering a stroke.

ECL (data-centric programming language)

ECL is a declarative, data centric programming language designed in 2000 to allow a team of programmers to process big data across a high performance computing cluster without the programmer being involved in many of the lower level, imperative decisions.
History.
ECL was initially designed and developed in 2000 by David Bayliss as an in-house productivity tool within Seisint Inc and was considered to be a ‘secret weapon’ that allowed Seisint to gain market share in its data business. Equifax had an SQL-based process for predicting who would go bankrupt in the next 30 days, but it took 26 days to run the data. The first ECL implementation solved the same problem in 6 minutes. The technology was cited as a driving force behind the acquisition of Seisint by LexisNexis and then again as a major source of synergies when LexisNexis acquired ChoicePoint Inc.
Language constructs.
ECL, at least in its purest form, is a declarative, data centric language. Programs, in the strictest sense, do not exist. Rather an ECL application will specify a number of core datasets (or data values) and then the operations which are to be performed on those values.
Hello world.
ECL is to have succinct solutions to problems and sensible defaults. The "Hello World" program is characteristically short:
"Hello World".
Perhaps a more flavorful example would take a list of strings, sort them into order, and then return that as a result instead.
The statements containing a codice_1 are defined in ECL as attribute definitions. They do not denote an action; rather a definition of a term. Thus, logically, an ECL program can be read: "bottom to top"
OUTPUT(SD)
What is an SD?
SD := SORT(D,Value); 
SD is a D that has been sorted by ‘Value’
What is a D?
D := DATASET([{'ECL'},{'Declarative'},{'Data'},{'Centric'},{'Programming'},{'Language'}],{STRING Value;});
D is a dataset with one column labeled ‘Value’ and containing the following list of data.
ECL primitives.
ECL primitives that act upon datasets include: SORT, ROLLUP, DEDUP, ITERATE, PROJECT, JOIN, NORMALIZE, DENORMALIZE, PARSE, CHOSEN, ENTH, TOPN, DISTRIBUTE
ECL encapsulation.
Whilst ECL is terse and LexisNexis claims that 1 line of ECL is roughly equivalent to 120 lines of C++ it still has significant support for large scale programming including data encapsulation and code re-use. The constructs available include: MODULE, FUNCTION, FUNCTIONMACRO, INTERFACE, MACRO, EXPORT, SHARED
Support for Parallelism in ECL.
In the HPCC implementation, by default, most ECL constructs will execute in parallel across the hardware being used. Many of the primitives also have a LOCAL option to specify that the operation is to occur locally on each node.
Comparison to Map-Reduce.
The Hadoop Map-Reduce paradigm actually consists of three phases which correlate to ECL primitives as follows.

Arrope

Arrope is a form of grape concentrate typically produced in Spain. Often derived from grape varieties such as Pedro Ximénez, it is made by boiling unfermented grape juice until the volume is reduced by at least 50%, and its viscosity reduced to a syrup. The final product is a thick liquid with cooked caramel flavours, and its use is frequent as an additive for dark, sweet wines such as sweet styles of sherry, Malaga, and Marsala.

Cornelius Newton Bliss Jr.

Cornelius Newton Bliss Jr. (April 15, 1875–April 5, 1949) was an American merchant, political organizer, and philanthropist.
He was born in April 15, 1875 in New York City to Cornelius Newton Bliss, a prominent Republican Party politician later named Secretary of the Interior under President William McKinley. Bliss Jr. was raised in New York City and attended Harvard University, graduating in 1897 with a bachelors of arts. After college, he entered the family dry goods business, later becoming a full partner. In 1906, he married Zaidee C. Cobb, with whom he had three children: daughter Elizabeth and sons Cornelius Newton III and Anthony Addison.
Bliss followed his father's involvement in politics, participating in the presidential campaign of Theodore Roosevelt. In July 1916, he was named treasurer of the Republican National Committee and participated in the losing presidential campaign of Charles Evans Hughes, which he helped operate from New York City. During the campaign, he also served as president of the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, a role he filled from 1913 to 1934.
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, President Wilson named Bliss to his War Council, a group of advisers Wilson collected to guide his actions as commander in chief. After the war, Bliss returned to business and philanthropy on a large scale, operating as a trustee, board member, or president of several organizations, including the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Metropolitan Opera, and Grant Monument Association.
When the Great Depression began, he was one of six men named by New York City Mayor Walker to operate a $15 million relief fund created in November 1931. Two of the other men were J.P. Morgan and former governor Alfred E. Smith. In 1932, he resigned from the board of his family's company, Bliss, Fabyan and Company. He received an LL.D. from New York University in 1937.
Through his later life, he continued to promote the arts, serving as president of the Metropolitan Opera from 1938 to 1946. His sister, Lillie P. Bliss (d. 1931), was the founder of the Museum of Modern Art, and he supported that effort as well. During World War II, he was a chairman of the American Red Cross committee on war activities, and became interim chairman of the American Red Cross when regular chairman Norman Davis became ill.
He was also a member of the famous Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia.
In late March 1949, he became ill, and died in Roosevelt Hospital on April 5, 1949, after 10 days of increasing sickness.

<doc id="31108393" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31108393" title="Single-use bioreactor">
Single-use bioreactor

A single-use bioreactor or "disposable bioreactor" is a bioreactor with a disposable bag instead of a culture vessel. Typically, this refers to a bioreactor in which the lining in contact with the cell culture will be plastic, and this lining is encased within a more permanent structure (typically, either a rocker or a cuboid or cylindrical steel support). Commercial single-use bioreactors have been available since the end of the 1990s and are now made by several well-known producers (See below) .
Single-use technology at bioreactors.
Single-use bioreactors are widely used in the field of mammalian cell culture and are now rapidly replacing conventional bioreactors. 
Instead of a culture vessel made from stainless steel or glass, a single-use bioreactor is equipped with a disposable bag. The disposable bag is usually made of a three-layer plastic foil. One layer is made from Polyethylene terephthalate or LDPE to provide mechanical stability. A second layer made using PVA or PVC acts as a gas barrier. Finally, a contact layer is made from PVA or PP. For medical applications the single-use materials that contact the product must be certified by the European Medicines Agency or similar authorities responsible for other regions.
Types of single-use bioreactors.
In general there are two different approaches for constructing single-use bioreactors, differing in the means used to agitate the culture medium. 
Some single-use bioreactors use stirrers like conventional bioreactors, but with stirrers that are integrated into the plastic bag. The closed bag and the stirrer are pre-sterilized. In use the bag is mounted in the bioreactor and the stirrer is connected to a driver mechanically or magnetically. 
Other single-use bioreactors are agitated by a rocking motion. This type of bioreactor does not need any mechanical agitators inside the single-use bag.. 
Both the stirred and the rocking motion single-use bioreactors are used up to a scale of 1000 Liters volume. 
Several variations on these two methods exist. The Kuhner Shaker, was originally designed for media preparation, but is also useful for cell cultivation. The PBS Biotech Air Wheel technology uses buoyancy from the air feed to provide rotational power to a stirrer.
Measurement and control.
Measurement and control of a cell culture process using a single-use bioreactor is challenging, as the bag in which the cultivation will be performed is a closed and pre-sterilized system. Sensors for measuring the temperature, conductivity, glucose, oxygen, or pressure must be built into the bag during the manufacturing prior to sterilization. The sensors can’t be installed prior to use of the bioreactor as in the conventional case. Consequently some challenges must be taken into consideration. The bag is assembled, delivered and stored dry, with the consequence that the usual pH-electrodes can not be used. Calibration or additional assembly is not possible. These constraints have led to the development of preconfigured bags with new types of analytical probes. The pH value can be measured using a patch that is just a few millimeters in size. This patch consists of a protecting membrane with a pH-sensitive dye behind it. Changing pH in the culture medium changes the pH, and the color, of the dye. The color change can be detected with a laser external to the bag. This and other methods of non-invasive measurement have been developed for single-use bioreactors.
Single-use process.
Beside single-use bioreactors, complete Single-Use Processes are offered by the world leading manufacturer, Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH. Single-use process steps available are: media and buffer preparation, cell harvesting, filtration, purification and virus inactivation. Other manufacturers include PBS Biotech, Inc. with its novel Air-Wheel mixing mechanism and low shear and scalability from lab to cGMP (Good manufacturing practice) production and is fully integrated, easy to use www.pbsbiotech.com as well as Millipore, which is primarily upstream equipment www.millipore.com, GE Healthcare Life Sciences with its WAVE brand rocking, single-use bioreactor and Thermo Scientific www.thermo.com with its traditional stirred or impeller shaft based mixing approach does also have some of this technologies available. Only Sartorius Stedim, PBS Biotech, Thermo Fisher Hyclone, and Xcellerex (now part of GE Healthcare Life Sciences) have the ability to provide a fully scalable solution for a complete lab-to-production bioprocess. The BioProcess Systems Alliance (BPSA) is the single use association advocating broader application of single-use to include cGMP Good manufacturing practice use which will require FDA support. The agency has stated in public forums it is a major backer of single use technology in general, as the technology provides significant benefits and value, including mitigation of cross contamination and reduced industry costs. The FDA has stated it will not issue guidance to the industry on single use but "may" issue Q and As on its web site. When an FDA approved single use production site is approved, the gates will open for broader and faster single use adoption worldwide. Already single use has shown itself to be a huge cost saver and to increase process flexibility and operational efficiency for biosimilar applications and for biotech startups and CROs. Emerging markets are expected to embrace single use vs stainless given their lack of legacy infrastructure and desire to drive capex and opex costs out of the biotech operation. The market today is approx. $200M and could grow to over $1B or more in the next 4–5 years.
Advantages and disadvantages.
Compared with conventional bioreactor systems, the single-use solution has some advantages. Application of single-use technologies reduces cleaning and sterilization demands. Some estimates show cost savings of more than 60% with single use systems compared to fixed asset stainless steel bioreactors. In pharmaceutical production, complex qualification and validation procedures can be made easier, and will finally lead to significant cost reductions. The application of single-use bioreactors reduces the risk of cross contamination and enhances the biological and process safety. Single-use applications are especially suitable for any kind of biopharmaceutical product.
Single-use bioreactors contain fewer parts compared with conventional bioreactors, so the initial and maintenance costs are reduced.
Limiting factor for the use of "some" single-use bioreactors is the achievable oxygen transfer, represented by the specific mass transfer coefficient (kL) for the specific phase area (a), resulting in the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa). Theoretically this can be influenced by a higher energy input (increasing the stirrer speed or the rocking frequency). However, since single-use bioreactors are mainly used for cell culturing, the energy input is limited by the delicate nature of cells. Higher energy input leads to higher sheer forces causing the risk of cell damages. 
Single-use bioreactors are currently available with up to a volume of about 1000 L; that’s why scale up is limited compared to conventional bioreactors. However, a handful of suppliers are now delivering units at the 2,000 liter scale and some suppliers (Sartorius, Xcellerex, Thermo Scientific HyClone and PBS Biotech) are providing a family of single-use bioreactors from bench-top to full-scale production. Three challenges exist for faster and greater single use bioreactor adoption 1) higher quality and lower cost disposable bags and containers, 2) more reusable and disposable sensors and probes that can provide high quality analytics including real-time cell culture level data points, and 3) a family of bioreactors from lab to production that has full scale-up of the bioprocess. Suppliers are working to improve plastic bag materials and performance and also to develop a broader range of sensors and probes that provide scientists greater insight to cell density, quality and other metrics needed to improve yields and product efficacy. New perfusion devices are also becoming popular for certain cell culture applications.
Environmental aspects.
Environmental aspects for single-use bioreactors are important to consider due to the amount of disposable material used compared with conventional bioreactors. A complete life cycle assessment comparing single-use bioreactors and conventional bioreactors does not exist, but many ecological reasons are supporting the concept of single-use bioreactors. For a complete life cycle assessment not only the manufacturing, but also the repeated use need to be considered. Even the main part of a single-use bioreactor is not a disposable, but will be continuously reused. The plastic bag that is used instead of a culture vessel is a disposable, as well as all the integrated sub-assemblies like sensors, tubing, and stirrers. The bag and all its parts are mainly made from plastics that are derived from petroleum. Current recycling concepts are mainly focused on incineration, to recover the energy originated from the petroleum as heat and electricity. Most of the petroleum would be burned anyway in power plants or automobiles. Burning of the single use components of bioreactors creates a detour through biochemical engineering during their life cycle that does not have a big influence. The making of conventional culture vessels form stainless steel or glass requires more energy than making plastic bags. Using conventional bioreactors the culture vessel need to be cleaned and sterilized after each fermentation. Cleaning requires large amounts of water, in addition to acids, alkali and detergents. Sterilization with steam at 121 degrees C and 1 bar pressure requires large quantities of energy and large amounts of distilled water. Distilled water in terms of the pharmaceutical grad is called water for injection that must be prepared by spending lots or energy as well.
A comparison of the life cycle assessment of conventional and single-use bioreactors looks much more favorable for the single-use bioreactors as expected before. According a report of A. Sinclair et al. Single-use bioreactors will help to save 30% of electrical energy for operation, 62% of the energy input for the production of the system, 87% of water and finally 95% of detergents, all compared to conventional bioreactors.

Migration period of ancient Burma

[[File:Spreading homo sapiens.svg|thumb|320px|Map of early human migrations
]] Humans lived in the region that is now Burma as early as 11,000 years ago, but archeological evidence dates the first settlements at about 2500 BCE with cattle rearing and the production of bronze. By about 1500 BCE, ironworks were in existence in the Irrawaddy Valley but cities, and the emergence of city states, probably did not occur until the early years of the Common era when advances in irrigation systems and the building of canals allowed for year long agriculture and the consolidation of settlements.
The first identifiable civilisation which inhabited modern-day Burma is that of the Mon. They settled in the Ayeyarwady River delta area and along the Taninthayi coast. The proto-Burmans, the Pyu, settled in and around Pyay, and in the northwestern Ayeyarwaddy valley. Trace of their presence can be found in Sri Ksetra near Pyay, and in Beikthanoe in central Burma. The Mon are believed to have begun migrating into the area in about 3000 BC, and their first kingdom Suwarnabhumi (pronounced Suvanna Bhoum) was centred on the port city of Thaton, which itself was established around 300 BC.
Artifacts from the excavated site of Nyaunggan help to reconstruct Bronze Age life in Burma and the more recent archaeological evidence at Samon Valley south of Mandalay suggests rice growing settlements between about 500 BC and 200 AD which traded with Qin and Han dynasty China.
Out of Africa.
Historical migration of human populations begins with the movement of "Homo erectus" out of Africa across Eurasia about a million years ago. "Homo sapiens" appear to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago, moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago, and had spread across Australia, Asia and Europe by 40,000 years. Early members of the "Homo" genus, i.e. "Homo ergaster", "Homo erectus" and "Homo heidelbergensis", migrated from Africa during the Early Pleistocene, possibly as a result of the operation of the Saharan pump, around 1.9 million years ago, and dispersed throughout most of the Old World, reaching as far as Southeast Asia. Modern humans, "Homo sapiens", evolved in Africa up to 200,000 years ago and reached the Near East around 70 millennia ago. From the Near East, these populations spread east to South Asia by 50 millennia ago.
The Indo-European migration had variously been dated to the end of the Neolithic (Marija Gimbutas: Corded ware, Yamna, Kurgan), the early Neolithic (Colin Renfrew: Starčevo-Körös, Linearbandkeramic) and the late Palaeolithic (Marcel Otte, Paleolithic Continuity Theory).
The speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language are usually believed to have originated to the north of the Black Sea (today Eastern Ukraine and Southern Russia), and from there they gradually migrated into, and spread their language by cultural diffusion to, Anatolia, Europe, and Central Asia, Iran and South Asia starting from around the end of the Neolithic period (see Kurgan hypothesis).
Through China.
Evidence indicates that the ancestors of the Austronesians' spread from the South Chinese mainland to Taiwan at some time around 8,000 years ago. Evidence from historical linguistics suggests that it is from this island that seafaring peoples migrated, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the Austronesian languages. It is believed that this migration began around 6,000 years ago.
The prehistory of Taiwan includes the late Paleolithic era. During that time, roughly 50,000 BC to 10,000 BC, people were already living in Taiwan. The Pacific islands of Polynesia began to be colonized around 1300 BC, and completely colonized by around 900 AD. The descendants of Polynesians left Taiwan around 5200 years ago. Salones and Pashu (Malays of Burma) arrived southern Burma through this sea route.
Taiwan is the urheimat of the Austronesian languages. Archaeological evidence (e.g., ) suggests that speakers of pre-Proto-Austronesian spread from the South Chinese mainland to Taiwan at some time around 8,000 years ago. Evidence from historical linguistics suggests that it is from this island that seafaring peoples migrated, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the Austronesian languages . It is believed that this migration began around 6,000 years ago .
When Han Chinese invaded Taiwan, the ethnic minorities (including Tibeto-Burmans, Shans and Mons of future Burma) shifted to the mainland China. Some historians believe that those ethnic minorities first came to settle north of the Yellow (Huang Ho) river, occupying the region known as Hebei and Shanxi round about 2515 BC. The Chinese annals also mention about their settlements in the middle basin of the Yellow River in 850 BC. But new emigrants coming from Central Asia later impelled those ethnic groups to move southwards to new fertile areas between the Yellow and Yangtze (Chang Jiang) rivers and then migrated down through the present day Yunnan and descended further down into Burma.
Sixteen kingdoms were a plethora of short-lived non-Chinese dynasties that came to rule the whole or parts of northern China in the 4th and 5th centuries. Many ethnic groups were involved, including ancestors of the Turks, Mongolians, and Tibetans.
Chinese history is that of a dynasty alternating between periods of political unity and disunity and occasionally becoming dominated by foreign Asian peoples, most of whom were assimilated into the Han Chinese population. Cultural and political influences from many parts of Asia, carried by successive waves of immigration, expansion, and assimilation, merged to create modern Chinese culture.
The History of Yunnan is related to Burma, can date back to Yuanmou Man, a "Homo erectus" fossil, the oldest known hominid fossil in China. By the Neolithic period, there were human settlements in the area of Lake Dian. These people used stone tools and constructed simple wooden structures. Yunnan's location in the southwesternmost corner of China and its peoples hae the strong ethnic identities are due to cultural and political influences from Burma. In 109 BC, Emperor Wu sent General Guo Chang (郭昌) south to Yunnan, establishing Yizhou commandery and 24 subordinate counties. The commandery seat was at Dianchi county (present day Jinning 晋宁). Another county was called "Yunnan", probably the first use of the name. To expand the burgeoning trade with Burma and India. Anthropologists have determined that these people were related to the people now known as the Tai. They lived in tribal congregations, sometimes led by exile Chinese. In the "Records of the Grand Historian", Zhang Qian (died 113 BC) and Sima Qian (145-90 BC) make references to "Shendu", which may have been referring to the Indus Valley (the Sindh province in modern Pakistan), originally known as "Sindhu" in Sanskrit. When Yunnan was annexed by the Han Dynasty, Chinese authorities also reported a Shendu" (Indian) community living in the area. The Mongols established regular and tight administrative control over Yunnan. In 1253 Möngke Khan of the Mongol Empire dispatched the prince Kublai to take Yunnan. The Mongols swept away numerous native regimes, including the leading Dali kingdom. Later Yunnan became one of the ten provinces set up by Kubilai Khan. Kublai Khan appointed Turkmen Sayyid Ajjal Shams al-Din Omar governor in Yunnan in 1273.
History of Tibet is also related to prehistoric Burma. It is situated between the two ancient civilizations of China and India, separated from the former by the mountain ranges to the east of the Tibetan Plateau and from the latter by the towering Himalayas. Tibet is nicknamed "the roof of the world" or "the land of snows". The Tibetan language and its dialects are classified as members of the Tibeto-Burman language family. Humans inhabited the Tibetan Plateau at least twenty one thousand years ago. This population was largely replaced around 3,000 BP by Neolithic immigrants from northern China. However there is a "partial genetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and the contemporary Tibetan populations". Some archaeological data suggests humans may have passed through Tibet at the time India was first inhabited, half a million years ago. The first documented contact between the Tibetans and the Mongols occurred when Genghis Khan met Tsangpa Dunkhurwa (Gtsang pa Dung khur ba) and six of his disciples, probably in the Tangut empire, in 1215.
Through India.
Paleolithic sites have been discovered in Pothohar near Pakistan's capital Islamabad, with the stone tools of the Soan Culture. In ancient Gandhara, near Islamabad, evidence of cave dwellers dated 15,000 years ago has been discovered at Mardan.
The major cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, such as Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, date back to around 3300 BC, and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world.
It is believed that the migration in and out of India began around 6,000 years ago. Indo-Aryan migration to and within Northern India is consequently presumed to have taken place in the Middle to Late Bronze Age, contemporary to the Late Harappan phase in India (c. 1700 to 1300 BC). From 180 BC, a series of invasions from Central Asia followed, including those led by the Indo-Greeks, Indo-Scythians, Indo-Parthians and Kushans in the north-western Indian subcontinent. The word "India" is derived from the Indus River. In ancient times, "India" initially referred to the region of modern-day Pakistan along the Indus river, but by 300 BC, Greek writers like Megasthenes applied the term to the entire subcontinent.:)
History of South India especially Chola Empire is related to prehistoric Burma. One of the most powerful rulers of the Chola kingdom was Raja Raja Chola. He ruled from 985–1014 CE. His army conquered the Navy of the Cheras at Thiruvananthapuram, and annexed Anuradhapura and the northern province of Ceylon. Rajendra Chola I completed the conquest of Sri Lanka, invaded Bengal, and undertook a great naval campaign that occupied parts of Malaya, Burma, and Sumatra.
Since 500 BC Buddhist Orrisa colonists had migrated towards Southeast and settled in future Burma's Irrawaddy Delta and built pagodas.
In 180 BC migrants from the Hindu colonists, of Telugu Dynasty, from middle India settled in lower part of future Burma and established Hanthawaddy (Mon town) and Syriam (Ta Nyin or Than Lyin) in Burma.
Indian Dravidian tribe in Panthwa In Chinese Chronicles Chen Yi-Sein instead gives an Indian derivation for Panthwa village, as the name of a Dravidian tribe settled in Mon's areas around the Gulf of Martaban. This group was later one of the pioneers in a ‘Monized’ occupation of Beikthano village, which also led to the village/city being called Ramanna-pura, linked to Mon areas of southern Burma (1999:77).
The Tagaung dynasty is explicitly incorporated into the story of Duttabaung's mother and father; the lineage of the Queen of Beikthano is less consistent, but always intertwined with that of the Sri Kestra village rulers. In all of these, links are made between territorial control, royal patronage of Hindu or Buddhist sects and supernatural events.
Little is known about life in early Burma but there is evidence that land and sea traders from China and India passed by and left their mark on the region and the local people traded ivory, precious stones, gold and silver, rhinoceros horns, and horses with these traders. Roman envoys from Alexandria also passed through the Irrawaddy valley in 79 CE en route to China. 2nd century Burmese sea-farers, trading with Southern India across the Bay of Bengal, are thought to have brought Buddhism to Burma in the 2nd century CE. and by the 4th century, much of the Irrawaddy Valley was Buddhist including the then dominant city-state, Prome (modern Pyay).
Mizos were part of a great wave of migration from China and later moved out to India to their present habitat. It is possible that the Mizos came from Sinlung or Chhinlungsan located on the banks of the Yalung River in China, first settled in the Shan State and moved on to the Kabaw Valley.
The Naga were originally referred to as "Naka" in Burmese languages, which means 'people with pierced ears'. The Naga tribes had socio-economic and political links with tribes in Assam and Burma (Myanmar); even today a large population of Naga inhabits Assam. Following an invasion in 1816, the area, along with Assam, came under direct rule of Burma up to the time British East India Company took control of Assam in 1826 following the Treaty of Yandaboo of 1826. The history of Assam is the history of a confluence of peoples from the east, west and the north; the confluence of the Indo-Aryan, Austro-Asiatic and Tibeto-Burman cultures. The Late neolithic cultures have affinities with the spread of the Mon Khmer speaking people from Malaysia and the Ayeyarwady valley and late neolithic developments in South China. Since these cultures have been dated to 4500-4000 BCE, the Assam sites are dated to approximate that period.
Earliest migrants amongst Burmese.
Those Mon (Talaings) brought with them the culture, arts, literature, religion and all the skills of civilisation of present Burma. They founded the Thaton and Bago (Pegu) Kingdoms. King Anawrahta of Bagan (Pagan) conquered that Mon Kingdom of King Manuha, named Suvannabumi (The Land of Golden Hues).
The conquest of Thaton in 1057 was a decisive event in Burmese history. It brought the Burman into direct contact with the Indian civilizing influences in the south and opened the way for intercourse with Buddhist centres overseas, especially Ceylon.
The evidence of the inscriptions, Luce warns us, shows that the Buddhism of Pagan ‘was mixed up with Hindu Brahmanic cults, Vaisnavism in particular.
While little is known about the early people of Burma, the Mon were the first of the modern ethnic groups to migrate into the region, starting around 1500 BCE. Oral tradition suggests that they had contact with Buddhism via seafaring as early as the 3rd century BCE, though definitely by the 2nd century BCE when they received an envoy of monks from Ashoka. Much of the Mon's written records have been destroyed through wars. The Mons blended Indian and Mon cultures together in a hybrid of the two civilisations. By the mid-9th century, they had come to dominate all of southern Burma.
Forefathers of Bamars.
The Burmese language is a Tibeto-Burman language and closely related to the Yi language or Nuosu, which is today spoken mainly in Yunnan but also in parts of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces in China. Until a thousand years ago, Tibeto-Burman and more specifically Burmese-Yi speaking peoples were much more widespread, across Yunnan and Guizhou and southern Sichuan as well as northern Burma. During the Han dynasty in China, Yunnan was ruled primarily by the Burmese-Yi speaking Dian and Yelang kingdoms. During the Tang dynasty in China, Yunnan as well as northern Burma was ruled by the Burmese-Yi speaking Nanzhao kingdom (until the 1960s mistakenly thought to be Tai-speaking). It was during this Burmese-Yi Nanzhao domination of northern Burma that the first Burmese-Yi speakers probably entered the Irrawaddy valley in large numbers, and established the outpost of Pagan or Bagan. The naming system of the earliest Bagan kings is identical to the naming system of the Nanzhao kings. Sculptures found in Halin to the north are almost identical to Nanzhao sculptures. The Tanguts of Xixia (to the north of Yunnan around this time) spoke a Tibeto-Burman language that may also have been close to Burmese-Yi. Going further back in time, the people of the ancient kingdom of Sanxingdui in Sichuan were probably ancestral to the later Tibet-Burmans and perhaps even more narrowly to the ancestors of the Burmese-Yi speakers at Dian and Yelang.
Geography that facilitated the migration of Tibeto-Burman, Shans and Mons.
Numerous ethnic Burmese peoples had migrated from Yunnan, which is situated in southwest China, bounded on the north by Sichuan and Sizang (Sikang), on the east by Guizhou and Guangxi, on the south by Vietnam and Burma, and on the west by Burma and Assam. It is extremely mountainous with only a limited area of level plains.
It is furrowed by the Taiping, Shweli, Salween, Mekong, Black and Red rivers.
The Salween and the Mekong are rivers of great length, having their sources in the interior part of Tibet, and flowing through Yunnan and the neighboring lands of Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
The basins of these rivers and their tributaries form deep, narrow valleys which, with the high parallel mountain ranges running generally north and south, constitute a favourable home for numerous ethnic minorities.
Yunnan shares a long common border with Burma and many ethnic groups that live in Yunnan can also be found in Burma.
Burma is like a big super-highway between India and China. India and China are the world's biggest and ancient cradles of civilization. High, snow peaked, rough and steep Himalaya mountain ranges block the direct interaction or travelling between the two of them except for the virtual highway through Burma. So there were a lot of travelers, migrants, victims of disasters and famine, war refugees and etc. moving along this Burma Highway and some of them settled in Burma.
Indian and Burmese settlement in Arakan.
The Arakanese chronicles claim that the Kingdom was founded in 2666 BC.
Wesali or Vaisali was founded by Hindu Chandra Dynasty. "The area known as North Arakan had been for many years before the 8th century the seat of Hindu dynasties. In 788 AD a new dynasty, known as the Chandras, founded the city of Wesali. This city became a noted trade port to which as many as a thousand ships came annually; the Chandra kings were upholders of Buddhism, ... their territory extended as far north as Chittagong;---- Wesali was an easterly Hindu kingdom of Bengal --- Both government and people were Indian. So far as Arakan is concerned, the inscriptions show traces of two early dynasties holding sway in the north. The earlier one, a Candra dynasty, seems to have been founded in the middle of the 4th century AD. Its capital was known by the Indian name of Vaisali and it maintained close connections with India. Thirteen kings of this dynasty are said to have reigned for a total period of 230 years. The second dynasty was founded in the 8th century by a ruler referred to as Sri Dharmavijaya, who was of pure Ksatriya descent. His grandson married a daughter of the Pyu king of Sri Ksetra.
Hindu statues and inscriptions were found in Wesali. The ruins of old capital of Arakan - Wesali show Hindu statues and inscriptions of the 8th century. Although the Chandras usually held Buddhistic doctrines, there is reason to believe that Brahmanism and Buddhism flourished side by side in the capital.
"The Burmese do not seem to have settled in Arakan until possibly as late as the tenth century AD. Hence earlier dynasties are thought to have been Indian, ruling over a population similar to that of Bengal. All the capitals known to history have been in the north near modern Akyab".
Salones (Moken) and Pashus (Malays).
In the southernmost part of Burma, the Salones (Moken) and Pashus (Malays) migrated into Burma from the south and sea since prehistoric time.
The Burmese call the Moken Selung, Salone, or Chalome. In Thailand they are called Chao Ley (people of the sea) or Chao nam (people of the water), although these terms are also used loosely to include the Urak Lawoi and even the Orang Laut. In Thailand, acculturated Moken are called Thai Mai (new Thais).
The Moken are also called Sea Gypsies, a generic term that applies to a number of peoples in southeast Asia. The Urak Lawoi are sometimes classified with the Moken, but they are linguistically and ethnologically distinct, being much more closely related to the Malay people.
They refer to themselves as Moken. The name is used for all of the proto-Malayan speaking tribes who inhabit the coast and islands in the Andaman Sea on the west coast of Thailand, the provinces of Satun, Trang, Krabi, Phuket, Phang Nga, and Ranong, up through the Mergui Archipelago of Burma. The group includes the Moken proper, the Moklen (Moklem), the Orang Sireh (Betel-leaf people) and the Orang Lanta. The last, the Orang Lanta are a hybridized group formed when the Malay people settled the Lanta islands where the proto-Malay Orang Sireh had been living.

Dicerandra immaculata

Dicerandra immaculata is a rare species of flowering plant in the mint family known by the common names Lakela's mint, Olga's mint, and spotless balm. It is endemic to Florida in the United States, where it is known only from Indian River and St. Lucie Counties. There are seven occurrences of the plant, two of which are scheduled for destruction as the land is cleared for development. The plant was federally listed as an endangered species in 1985.
This is an aromatic perennial shrub growing up to about half a meter tall, with several erect stems emerging from a woody-topped taproot. The narrow leaves are up to 3 centimeters long by 4 millimeters wide. The herbage is mint-scented. 1 to 3 flowers occur in the leaf axils. The flower is purplish pink in color and lacks the spots that those of many other "Dicerandra" have. The throat of the flower is tubular and not bent. The anthers of the flowers have tiny spurs that act as triggers, causing the flower to release pollen when an insect arrives. There are now two varieties of this plant, with var. "savannarum" having been described in 2001. It has wider leaves and more limp branches than var. "immaculata".
This plant grows in white- and yellow-sand Florida scrub habitat. It can be found in openings and slightly shady areas where the wind or wildfire has cleared a partial or total space in the canopy. This habitat is becoming ever more rare today as it is consumed for development; Florida's population is growing rapidly. Several known populations of this plant have been destroyed in the process. Remaining tracts of land are very fragmented.
There are not many predators that tolerate the strong oils of this mint, so herbivory is not a serious problem. Mildew affects the flowers sometimes, however, causing fruit destruction. Invasive plant species that threaten the habitat include Brazilian pepper ("Schinus terebinthifolius"), rosary pea ("Abrus precatorius"), Natal grass ("Rhynchelytrum repens"), and Guinea grass ("Panicum maximum").
Some new populations of the species have been planted in areas that are protected, even though they are outside the known historical range of the plant.

Body adiposity index

The Body Adiposity Index (BAI) is a method of measuring human body fat. The BAI is calculated without using body weight, unlike the body mass index (BMI) usually used as an indicator for body fat. Based on population studies, the BAI is approximately equal to the percentage of body fat for adult men and women of differing ethnicities.
The BAI is calculated as:
formula_1
Hip circumference (R = 0.602) and height (R = −0.524) are strongly correlated with percentage of body fat. Comparing BAI with "gold standard" dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results, the correlation between DXA-derived percentage of adiposity and the BAI in a target population was R = 0.85, with a concordance of C_b = 0.95.
The BAI could be a good tool to measure adiposity due, at least in part, to the advantages over other more complex mechanical or electrical systems. Probably, the most important advantage of BAI over BMI is that weight is not needed. However, in general it seems that the BAI does not overcome the limitations of BMI.
Stated advantages of the BAI are that it approximates body fat percentage, while the widely used BMI is known to be of limited accuracy, and is different for males and females with similar percentage body adiposity; and that it does not involve weighing, so can be used in remote locations with limited access to scales. A detailed study published in 2012 concluded that estimates of body fat percentage based on BAI were not more accurate than those based on BMI, waist circumference, or hip circumference. 
The adiposity indexes that include the waist circumference (WHtR and WC) may be better candidates than BAI and BMI to evaluate metabolic and cardiovascular risk in both clinical practice and research,

They have been known to help organise protests and other street activities alongside the National Front. One area on which there is disagreement between the two groups is the European Land base project, which the National Front does not support but which is one of the primary plans that Chapman has for Right Wing Resistance.

<doc id="31108829" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31108829" title="Second Level Address Translation">
Second Level Address Translation

Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), also known as nested paging, is a hardware-assisted virtualization technology which makes it possible to avoid the overhead associated with software-managed shadow page tables.
Intel's implementation of SLAT, known as Extended Page Table (EPT), was introduced in the Nehalem microarchitecture found in certain Core i7, Core i5, and Core i3 processors. AMD supports SLAT through the Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI) technology since the introduction of its third-generation Opteron processors (code name Barcelona).
Overview.
Modern processors use the concepts of physical memory and virtual memory; running processes use virtual addresses and when an instruction requests access to memory, the processor translates the virtual address to a physical address using a page table or TLB. When running a virtual system, it has allocated virtual memory of the host system that serves as a physical memory for the guest system, and the same process of address translation goes on also within the guest system. This increases the cost of memory access since the address translation needs to be performed twice once inside the guest system (using software-emulated shadow page table), and once inside the host system (using hardware page table).
In order to make this translation more efficient, processor vendors implemented technologies commonly called SLAT. By treating each guest-physical address as a host-virtual address, a slight extension of the hardware used to walk a non-virtualized page table (now the guest page table) can walk the host page table. With multilevel page tables the host page table can be viewed conceptually as "nested" within the guest page table. A hardware page table walker can treat the additional translation layer almost like adding levels to the page table. 
Using SLAT and multilevel page tables, the number of levels needed to be walked to find the translation doubles when the guest-physical address is the same size as the guest-virtual address and the same size pages are used. This increases the importance of caching values from intermediate levels of the host and guest page tables. It is also helpful to use large pages in the host page tables to reduce the number of levels (e.g., in x86-64, using 2 MB pages removes one level in the page table). Since memory is typically allocated to virtual machines at coarse granularity, using large pages for guest-physical translation is an obvious optimization, reducing the depth of look-ups and the memory required for host page tables.
Implementations.

Extended Page Tables (EPT) is an Intel second generation x86 virtualization technology for the memory management unit (MMU). EPT support is found in Intel's Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs, among others.
EPT is required in order to launch a logical processor directly in real mode, a feature called "unrestricted guest" in Intel's jargon, and introduced in the Westmere microarchitecture.
According to a VMware evaluation paper: "EPT provides performance gains of up to 48% for MMU-intensive benchmarks and up to 600% for MMU-intensive microbenchmarks", although it can actually be slower than a software implementation in some corner cases.
Rapid Virtualization Indexing.
Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI), known as Nested Page Tables during its development, is an AMD second generation hardware-assisted virtualization technology for the processor memory management unit (MMU).
A VMware research paper found that RVI offers up to 42% gains in performance compared with software-only (shadow page table) implementation. Tests conducted by Red Hat showed a doubling in performance for OLTP benchmarks.
RVI was introduced in the third generation of Opteron processors, code name Barcelona.
Support in software.
The following hypervisors support SLAT:
Note that some of the above hypervisors actually require EPT in order to work at all (not just faster) as they do not implement a software shadow page table; the list is not fully updated to reflect that.

Barton-Le-Clay Airfield

Barton-Le-Clay Airfield
Before the mid-1960s Barton-Le-Clay was called "Barton In The Clay" but the name was changed to the current form by the Parish Council of the time. All references and documentation prior to this date will be in the original village name. Barton In The Clay Aerodrome was first established in 1935 to the west of the village, on farmland owned by the nearby Brook End Green Farm. Its first residents were the newly formed Luton Aircraft Limited and The Dunstable Sailplane Company, both companies co-owned by W.L. Manuel and C.H. Latimer-Needham.
Luton Aircraft commenced construction of its two first aircraft under the management of W.L. Manuel, the Luton Buzzard and the Luton Minor. They were completed ready for flight on 12 December 1935 and 11 July 1936 respectively. In late 1936 the company moved from Barton-Le-Clay to new premises named "The Phoenix Works" on Oxford Rd, Gerrards Cross, after a fire substantially damaged the workshop building and contents.
The Dunstable Sailplane Company had started life just a year before, building and repairing gliders in the village of Hockliffe south west of Barton-Le-Clay. Most of the company's clients were from the recently formed and nearby London Gliding Club, from whose hangars Manuel had previously been working.
Marendaz Aircraft came to Barton-Le-Clay airfield in 1937, formed by D.M.K. Marendaz in 1936 from the remains of Marendaz Special Cars Ltd at the Cornwallis Works, Maidenhead to manufacture aircraft. Production of the company’s first aircraft had been severely damaged in a fire and the work to rebuild was priority after the move. The Marendaz Mk3 was registered as "G-AFGG" on 23 March 1938; a second aircraft called the Marendaz Trainer was registered as "G-AFZX" on 31 October 1939.
The Bedford School of Flying was granted licence on 1 January 1938 and the Flying school formed on 14 January 1938, training of a large number of CAG members (as many as 500). The airfield's day-to-day management was handled by International Aircraft & Engineering Ltd which, like the Bedford School of Flying, was owned by D.M.K. Marendaz and Dorothy Summers. The School operated until 1940.
On 22 July 1940 No 24 Elementary Flying Training School (EFTS) was established at Luton and Barton-le-clay was assigned as a Relief Training Ground as the main Luton airfield became more congested. When the EFTS relocated, Luton airfield became the home of No 5 Ferry Pool, an all-women group of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), who also used Barton-le-Clay as its Relief Training Ground. No.5 Ferry Pool had relocated from the Hatfield de Havilland Aircraft Company factory site and later moved operations to Haddenham, Buckinghamshire (RAF Thame), in 1943 though they retained use of the Barton-Le-Clay airfield, transporting student pilots by bus each day until the ATA disbanded at the end of November 1945.
Barton-le-Clay airfield returned to civil use post 1945, with the grass airstrip being returned to agriculture and the buildings being occupied for industrial use.
The airfield has an active research group which documents its findings on the Barton-Le-Clay Community Website.

Bloodlands

Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin is an historical and political analysis written by Yale historian Timothy D. Snyder, first published in book form by Basic Books on October 28, 2010. The book examines the political, cultural and ideological context tied to a specific area of land, under which the regimes of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union and Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany committed mass killing of an estimated 14 million non-combatants between the years 1933 and 1945. Snyders thesis is that the 'bloodlands', a region which comprised what is modern-day Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and the Baltic states, is the area where the regimes of Stalin and Hitler, despite their conflicting goals, interacted to increase suffering and bloodshed many times worse than any seen in western history. Snyder notes similarities between the two totalitarian regimes while also noting enabling interactions that re-enforced the destruction and suffering brought to bear on non-combatants. Snyder also brings scholarship to many forgotten, misunderstood, or misremembered parts of the history, particularly making note of the fact that most of the victims were not killed inside the concentration camps of the respective regimes. Snyder estimates, contrary to a commonly held view, that the Nazis were responsible for about twice as many noncombatant killings as Stalin's regime.
The book earned many positive reviews and has been called "revisionist history of the best kind". The book was awarded the 2013 Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought.
Synopsis.
The Eastern European regions that Snyder terms "Bloodlands" is the area where Hitler's vision of Racial supremacy and "Lebensraum" resulting in the Final Solution and other Nazi atrocities, met, sometimes in conflict, sometimes in cooperation, with Stalin's vision of a communist ideology which included the deliberate starvation and murder and imprisonment of innocent men, women and children in Gulags and elsewhere. Because of the efforts of the two regimes an estimated 14 million noncombatants in the Eastern Europe "Bloodlands" were killed, with Nazi Germany being responsible for about two thirds of the total number of deaths. 5.4m died in a well known event, the Holocaust – but many more died in more obscure circumstances.
The book confronts both a simplistic vision of history that has been termed "Nazis bad, Soviets good". and the manner by which the individual regimes are viewed alone and absent influence from outside. For instance, Snyder notes early Soviet support for the "Warsaw Uprising" against the Nazi occupation followed by a later unwillingness to assist the uprising in order that the Nazis might wipe the city clean for a later Soviet occupation. Snyder notes this as a clear example of interaction that may have led to many more deaths than might be the case had either regime acted independently. Snyder also takes a new look at parts of the history that have been previously understood only through the lens of propaganda and realpolitik: the Nazi–Soviet alliance of 1939; the Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust; Soviet persecution of the Polish underground; (cursed soldiers) or their own prisoners of war after the war. Snyder addresses other misconceptions, for example pointing out that many Jews were also killed by mass shootings as well as in the death camps. As Anne Applebaum comments, "The vast majority of Hitler’s victims, Jewish and otherwise, never saw a concentration camp". Similarly, all of the Soviet victims came from outside the Gulag concentration camp system, which 'only' accounts for a little over a million deaths. More Soviet prisoners died every day in Nazi camps during the Autumn of 1941 than Western Allied POWs in the entire war. Over 3 million Soviet POWs would die in the Nazi camps. The fate of the German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union would be little better; more than half a million died in terrible condition in the Soviet camps.
Snyder focuses on three periods, summarized by Richard Rhodes as: "deliberate mass starvation and shootings in the Soviet Union in the period from 1933 to 1938; mass shootings in occupied Poland more or less equally by Soviet and German killers in 1939 to 1941; deliberate starvation of 3.1 million Soviet prisoners of war and mass shooting and gassing of more than 5 million Jews by the Germans between 1941 and 1945".
The chapter covering the Holodomor (a word Snyder himself avoids) goes into considerable detail, for example recounting one story of an unofficial orphanage in village in the Kharkiv region where the children were so hungry they resorted to cannibalism, with one child eating parts of himself even while he was himself being cannibalised. 3.3m died during the Ukrainian starvation of 1933. Hitler starved 4.2 million persons in the Soviet Union (including 3.1 million POWs), largely Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians in the Hunger Plan.
The book points out similarities between the two regimes:
Snyder not only describes how two regimes operated in a similar manner, but how they often collaborated and aided one another, at least till the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union (see for example the Gestapo–NKVD Conferences). One of the areas both totalitarian regimes collaborated over was on the destruction of the Polish people (see Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles, Holocaust in Poland and Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)) and the Jews; between the two of them, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union killed about 200,000 Polish citizens in the period 1939–1941.
Snyder also points out that after the Western Allies had allied themselves with Stalin against Hitler, after the war ended they had no will to fight the second totalitarian regime; as American and British soldiers had never entered Eastern Europe, the tragedy of those lands was never well known to the American or British populace (see Western betrayal).
Number of Victims.
Timothy Snyder put the death toll, in the 'Bloodlands', at 14 million victims of both Stalin and Hitler, most of whom were non-combatants including indigenous civilians and Jewish civilians transported to death camps in Poland; combatants included disarmed military personnel in occupied countries and prisoners of war. Snyder pointed out that "I am not counting soldiers who died on the fields of battle". Snyder pointed out that this "is not a complete reckoning of all the death that Soviet and German power brought to the region". The victims Snyder lists were killed only as a result of "deliberate policies of mass murder" such as executions, deliberate famine and in death camps. Snyder maintains that he "generally excludes from the count" deaths due to exertion or disease or malnutrition in concentration camps; deportations, forced labor, evacuations, people who died of hunger as a result of wartime shortfalls and civilians killed by bombings or other acts of war. The geographic area covered by the "Bloodlands" is limited to Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic states and western Russian regions occupied by Germany. Regarding the figures, Snyder noted, "again, my reckoning is on the conservative side."
Timothy Snyder provided a summary of the 14 million victims.
A review of the book in the Ottawa Citizen summarized the number of victims -Bloodlands "is a chilling and instructive story of how 14 million unarmed men, women and children were murdered. The death toll includes two familiar victim groups -5.7 million Jews in the Holocaust and 3.3 million Ukrainians during the 1932-1933 famine engineered by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin -along with lesser-known victims that include three million Soviet prisoners of war who were deliberately starved to death".
Reception.
The book has received favourable reviews in various media outlets such as "BBC History" "The Seattle Times", and the "New York Observer" and has been described as "an impeccably researched history of mass killings in the eastern part of mid-20th-century Europe" by Robert Gerwarth in the "Irish Times".
Professor Neal Pease wrote: "Many books are useful; a handful can be called important; "Bloodlands" does no less than change the way we think of 20th century history, and of the deadly human cost of the totalitarian utopianism that was among its most distinctive characteristics."
Guy Walters writing in the "Financial Times" said he found the book disturbing, writing "Some may find Snyder’s staking-out of the area of the bloodlands too arbitrary for their tastes, and might accuse him of creating a questionable geographical delineation. Agree with it or not, in a sense it does not matter, because Snyder presents material that is undeniably fresh – what’s more, it comes from sources in languages with which very few western academics are familiar. The success of Bloodlands really lies in its effective presentation of cold, hard scholarship, which is in abundance."
Anne Applebaum writing for "The New York Review of Books" said "Snyder’s original contribution is to treat all of these episodes—the Ukrainian famine, the Holocaust, Stalin’s mass executions, the planned starvation of Soviet POWs, postwar ethnic cleansing—as different facets of the same phenomenon. Instead of studying Nazi atrocities or Soviet atrocities separately, as many others have done, he looks at them together. Yet Snyder does not exactly compare the two systems either. His intention, rather, is to show that the two systems committed the same kinds of crimes at the same times and in the same places, that they aided and abetted one another, and above all that their interaction with one another led to more mass killing than either might have carried out alone."
Neal Ascherson writing for "The Guardian" said, "In this book, he seems to have set himself three labours. The first was to bring together the enormous mass of fresh research – some of it his own – into Soviet and Nazi killing, and produce something like a final and definitive account. (Since the fall of communism, archives have continued to open and witnesses – Polish, Ukrainian, Belarussian especially – have continued to break silence.) But Snyder's second job was to limit his own scope, by subject and by place. He is not writing about the fate of soldiers or bombing victims in the second world war, and neither is he confining himself to the Jewish Holocaust. His subject is the deliberate mass murder of civilians – Jewish and non-Jewish – in a particular zone of Europe in a particular time-frame."
Some historians have criticized the book for its suggestion of a moral equivalence between Soviet mass murders and the Nazi Holocaust. Cambridge professor Richard Evans, who wrote a "blistering review" of the book, commented "It seems to me that he is simply equating Nazi genocide with the mass murders carried out in the Soviet Union under Stalin […] There is nothing wrong with comparing. It's the equation that I find highly troubling." It was suggested, however, and it was a point conceded by the Cambridge historian, that his negative review was partly "influenced by Snyder's own less than positive review of Evans's [… "The Third Reich at War"] in the "New York Review of Books"" the previous year. Dovid Katz, an historian of Lithuanian Jewry, commented that "Snyder flirts with the very wrong moral equivalence between Hitler and Stalin […] None of these incidents besides the Holocaust involved the willful massacre of a whole race. There is something very different going on, beyond politics, when people try to murder all the babies of a race." Other professional historians to take issue with Snyder's arguments and methods include Thomas Kühne, Omer Bartov, Dan Diner, Christian Ingrao and Dariusz Stola.The book has also drawn criticism from rightwing nationalists in Eastern Europe, who complain about Snyder's examination of East European collaboration in the Holocaust.
"Bloodlands" was named a book of the year for 2010 by "The Atlantic", "The Economist", "The Financial Times", "The Jewish Forward", "The Independent", "The New Republic", "New Statesman", "Reason", "The Seattle Times", and "The Daily Telegraph".

Compañía Logística de Hidrocarburos

The CLH Group, which is made up of Compañía Logística de Hidrocarburos, CLH S.A. and its subsidiary company, CLH Aviación S.A., is the leading company in Spain for the transportation and storage of oil products. The company has an 85-year history, as it comes from what used to be (CAMPSA) (Compañía Arrendataria del Monopolio de Petróleos). CLH is the result of the spin-off, in 1992, of the commercial assets of the former CAMPSA that was carried out as the culmination of the process for deregulating the oil sector after the approval of new European Community laws that ended the oil monopoly.
The CLH Group's main activity consists of transporting oil products – essentially gasolines, diesels, fuel oils and aviation fuels – from the refineries to the storage facilities the company has distributed across the whole of Spain, where its customers' tank trucks load these products and deliver them to the end consumers.
CLH holds logistics service contracts for the use of its facilities with most of the operators that do business in Spain, and competes with more than a dozen logistics companies that provide the Spanish market with storage and transportation services.
The International Energy Agency has given recognition to the flexibility and capacity this integrated storage and transportation system has for responding to unforeseen events.
The company also provides services related to consultancy and advice for international companies in the oil or logistics sectors, gaining its first experiences in countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Oman. Another service that CLH is fostering is strategic storage for European Union countries.
On the other hand, CLH Aviación, created in 1997 and a wholly owned subsidiary of CLH, operates at most of the Spanish airports in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands, offering services for the storage, distribution and into-plane supply of aviation fuels and lubricants. CLH Aviación also provides advice and technical assistance for the installation and maintenance of distribution networks for different types of aviation fuel.
The company has been given recognition by outside bodies, for example the highest rating in the world for sustainability in its sector, given by SAM (Sustainable Asset Management), the European Seal of Excellence 500+, various quality certificates from AENOR and the Family-Responsible Company (EFR) seal of approval.
Share structure.
Royal Decree-Law 6/2000 prohibits any CLH shareholder from holding more than 25% of the total number of company shares.
The shareholdings are distributed as follows:
Infrastructure.
Storage.
CLH has 38 storage facilities, with a capacity of 7.8 million cubic metres, for all types of oil products. They are distributed across the whole of Spain and the Balearic Islands.
Pipelines.
The company has a network of more than of pipeline that connect the eight Spanish refineries with the storage facilities. The CLH Group logistics system is the most extensive civil pipeline network in Western Europe.
Merchant fleet.
The CLH Group has two tankers in its fleet, the "Tinerfe" and the "Castillo de Trujillo", that are used for transporting fuel to the Balearic Islands and to areas in the Peninsula that are not reached by the pipeline network.
Airport facilities.
CLH Aviación has 28 airport facilities that are located at the major Spanish airports in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands, where it provides aviation fuel supply services to aircraft.
At Madrid/Barajas, Barcelona, Palma, Malaga and Alicante, the company has hydrant networks laid beneath the airport apron, which enable aircraft to be refuelled without the need to use tanker vehicles.
It also has a fleet of 113 refuellers and 48 hydrant dispenser vehicles that are specially designed for supplying aircraft with fuel.

Chil-Ustun

The Celestial Horses of Aravan, as they are known, are petroglyphs that have had an important role in regional 
folklore and that have become a pilgrimage site for Muslims in the Fergana Valley. 
Accessing the entrance, located on a steep, oblique rock, is difficult for inexperienced climbers.
Information.
There are about 200 caves altogether, scattered across an area of about 200 square kilometers in the almond-grove flat lands 
of the Ak-Bura and Aryan river basin. The vast majority are inaccessible except with a guide and ropes. Their Tajik name means 
'forty columns' and derives from the caves' numerous stalactites and stalagmites. The entrance to the Chil-Ustun system is about 
4 km from Aravan, high on the southern slope of a 1,460 m-high mountain of the same name. There are several dozen large caves that 
apparently measure more than 100 metres in length. Chil-Ustun. The cave is situated in Osh mountains, 3.5 km from the village, Aravan, 
in mid-rivers of Aravan and Ak-Buura in small mountain range of karst type. They are composed of sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic period,
350 million years of age. The top of the Chil-Ustun mountain rises above the valley at 425 meters. There is a huge entrance into the cave in the form 
of an arch with a height of 15 m and its base length of about 25 m, in the rock massif almost perpendicular to the wall 
(the height below the bottom of sai is 65 m) at an altitude of 1,100 m. In order to reach the entrance, on a steep sloping rock, 
a certain skill is required and a climbing insurance would help.This cave has been known since ancient times, which is evident by 
the Arabic inscriptions on the walls. Chil-Ustun cave has a length of 380 meters and consists of three spacious rooms connected by narrow corridors. 
The third room is very impressive, which can only be entered by crawling through a narrow manhole. The length of this room 
is more than 100 meters, the height is more than 20 meters, and the width of some separate sections reaches up to 50 meters. 
The room is supported by, glittering from moisture and light, columns. The walls are covered with crystals and stone laces. 
From a gentle touch, crystals begin to make sound. Calcite sinter forms (stalactites, talagmites, stalagnates (columns) reach 
50-meter height). Sinter cirques of bizarre shapes of different colors, from white to dark brown, create a unique interior of the room. 
This cave has received a name “Forty columns”. Pilgrims moved to Chil-Ustun. “If the sins are heavy, they will be swept away into the abyss” 
- says the legend. -”'"All is God’s will. But Almighty is merciful, and if a traveler goes through the rocky steeper and returns to the mountain foot unharmed - 
he will be forgiven all sins. And the crushed stone brought from Chil-Ustun will cure any disease."'”At the very edge of a precipice, at the entrance of plane tree, 
the branches of the tree lower mouldering strips of cloth. A little further, there is a sacrificial Buddhist mortar carved out. Above it, there is a barely discernible 
ligature of Sanskrit. Nearby, are the latter Arab writings. There is a trefoil symbol at a nearby stone, typical to those of earlier period in the history of these places.
A huge entrance in the cave in the form of arc with a height of 15 m and a length of basement ~ 25 m is located in the rocky group on almost plumb wall. 
It’s necessary to have a definite knack and alpinist insurance is preferable to get the entrance along the steep oblique rock. The cave has been known since 
ancient times, Arabian inscriptions on the walls are evidence of it. The cave consists of 3 halls of different volume, connected with corridors and narrow 
man-holes. The most far and biggest (the length is 85 m, the width is to 40 m, the height is to 20 m) in addition hall is the most beautiful. 
Tiff accumulated forms (stalactites, stalactites stalagmite (columns) amount to 50-metered of height). Wandering kars of quaint forms of different 
colors from white and cream to dark-brown create a unique fairy interior of the hall. The length of the cave is 380 m.

<doc id="31109011" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31109011" title="Solvophobic">
Solvophobic

Solvophobic theory attempts to explain interactions between polar solvents and non-polar solutes. In the pure solvent, there are relatively strong cohesive forces between the solvent molecules due to hydrogen bonding or other polar interactions. Hence, non-polar solutes tend not to be soluble in polar solvents because these solvent-solvent binding interactions must be overcome first. When applied to liquid chromatography (LC), solvophobic theory attributes the retention of solutes on the stationary phase partly to the rejection of solute molecules by the solvent, and partly to the attraction of the solute molecules by the stationary phase.

Historical 10 foot skiffs

Historical 10 Foot Skiffs are sailing skiffs raced by members of the Australian Historical Sailing Skiff Association at Drummoyne Sailing Club on the Parramatta River in Sydney and at the Brisbane 18 Footers Sailing Club on the Brisbane River in Bulimba, Brisbane. Racing is held under the auspices of the AHSSA. The 10 footers are beautiful boats with a strong sense of camaraderie among the crews, who are reliving the sailing events of the past.
Crew.
The 10 foot skiff is crewed by crews of 3 who attempt to keep these craft under control below large amounts of sail area. The only exception to this is the skiff Commonwealth II which requires between 4 and 5 crew depending on rig selected.
Racing.
In Sydney, these boats race once a month on a Sunday with a start at 13.30. The race generally lasts just over 2 hours and often draws a crowd of onlookers walking through the rigging area admiring these beautiful wooden craft. The size of the sail area, carried in 3 rigs also often draws comment. While they can be very twitchy boats to sail, they provide a modern view of sailing from a time long gone.
Boats.
Currently the oldest boat in the fleet is the Commonwealth II, built in 1997, is an exact replica of the Commonwealth which was built in 1907. This boat still sails and has had many memorable moments including a win on Handicap at the National Titles in 2006 when crewed by 4 sailors from Lake Macquarie. The Commonwealth II continues to sail in National Titles.
The oldest boat sailing regularly is the Dove, based on an old Queensland 12 foot skiff called Dove, she is one of the smaller 10s both in hull and rig. She has proved to be a very good handicap boat and recently won the NSW Handicap State Title in March, 2011.
The majority of the other boats are reproductions of hulls designed and built by Len Heffernan in the early 1950s and carry a mix of sails from 18s and 16 foot skiffs.
Dates and venues.
The sailing dates for the 10 footers at Drummoyne Sailing Club may be found at the 10 footer website.
The NSW 10 footers venture up to Lake Macquarie on the last Sunday in November each year and the first weekend in February where they hold the first two heats of the NSW State titles, before venturing back to Drummoyne Sailing Club for the last two heats.
The National Titles alternate between the Brisbane River, at the Brisbane Sailing Squadron, and the Drummoyne Sailing Club, on the Parramatta River.

Senior Year (film)

Senior Year is a 2010 Philippine film directed by Jerrold Tarog, which tells the story of ten students of a private Catholic high school in Manila, as they go through the many transitions that come with their final year in high school. The film features real high school students in its major roles, with more seasoned adult actors playing secondary roles, often taking their cue from the younger performers.
Plot.
The promotional material for "Senior Year" avoids giving the audience specific plot points, and describes the film simply as:
Cast.
"(in alphabetical order within each category)"
Production.
Casting and Screenplay.
To cast the film, Tarog sent surveys to about 300 students about their life experiences. The ten students with the most interesting stories were selected to be part of the cast. Tarog then put these students through a two month workshop, and then he started writing the screenplay for Senior Year.
"Kung anuman yung kwento ng buhay nila, dun ako na-inspire na magsulat ng script" (Whatever their own life stories were, that's where I drew the inspiration for writing the script.), Tarog would later explain.
Recognition.
The film received an "A" rating from the Philippines' Cinema Evaluation Board, and was heartily recommended by the Philippines' Department of Education. Aside from marking the film in the public eye as "excellent", an "A" rating from the Cinema Evaluation Board entitles a film to a 100% tax rebate on its box office sales.
The risky move of featuring real high school students in the major roles of the film paid off, with critics praising the young actors for their exceptional performances. The film was nominated for national awards even before its scheduled regular screenings.
The Entertainment Press Society (Enpress)'s 8th "Golden Screen Awards" (GSA), which opens the awards season for films in the Philippines, saw Senior Year nominated for six awards, including Best Motion Picture Drama, Best Director, Best Story, and Best Original Screenplay.
The Philippine Movie Press Club (PMPC)'s "Star Awards for Movies" saw Senior Year nominated for six awards, including Digital Movie Production Designer of the Year for Benjamin Padero, and five nominations for Tarog: Digital Movie Director of the Year, Digital Movie Screenplay of the Year, Digital Movie Editor of the Year, Digital Movie Musical Scorer of the Year,and Digital Movie Sound Engineer of the Year.
Promotion.
Faculty: A Prequel to Senior Year.
In 2010, as Senior Year was being made, the ABS CBN News Channel tapped Tarog to be part of AmBisyon 2010, a series in which directors would use short films to narratively present the various problems that would face whoever won the Presidency in the Philippine Presidential Election of 2010. Tarog's entry, covering the area of "education", was the short film "Faculty", subtitled "A prequel to Senior Year." The Ms. Joan character from Senior Year makes her first appearance in this short, which explains why the character, who used to be a College teacher, had become a high school teacher by the time she was shown in Senior Year. Faculty became a viral hit on various social networks, and the popularity of the short film became part of the marketing for its longer, more fleshed-out sequel.
Digitank Studios, 2010 Metro Manila Filmfest, and SM Cinemas.
During the development of the film, Tarog, who up to this point had been known primarily as an independent film director, told producer Franco Alido that he would ""do my best to come up with a film that he can show to everybody. But he has to do his best to show it to everybody."" He further explained that ""Any film that has commercial aspirations is nothing without the marketing that comes after it. People have to know the film is out there, that it wants to be seen. And that's exponentially more difficult for an independent film without big stars, huge billboards and full support from the major TV networks."" 
Alido and his Digitank Studios staff proceeded to do everything they could to promote the film, lugging promotional material and viewing equipment to different SM branches and eventually getting the film played in twelve SM Cinema Branches beginning March 9, while a nonconventional promotional campaign used Facebook and YouTube to build hype for the film, often taking advantage of the fact that the prequel short film, "Faculty", had become a viral favorite on social networking sites. As of the day before the regular screening, the campaign had attracted more than twelve thousand to the movie's official Facebook page.
The film was first screened as an independent film during the 2010 Metro Manila Film Festival, which began a special category for indie films that year.
It was later picked up for distribution in SM Cinemas and had its wider-audience premiere on March 2, 2011, and began its regular screening run on March 9.
SM Cinema extension campaign goes viral.
On the evening of the film's release, Tarog thanked those who had already seen the film and also encouraged those who hadn't seen it yet to watch the film as soon as possible.
On March 10, 2011, with viewers asking on the various social networks for the film to be extended, the film's marketing team replied ""We notice some of your pleas are addressed to SM Cinema. Well, you can tell it to them directly. Just Like their FB page and post on their Wall. It could work.""
Fans immediately started posting requests on the official SM Cinema wall so that the film would be extended, with the page soon becoming flooded with Senior Year requests. Theater patrons from areas where the SM Cinema branch wasn't showing Senior Year, such as Baguio, Laguna, and Batangas, also requested that the film be shown in their local SM Cinemas.
The campaign worked, and the film was screened in SM Cinemas for an entire week, an unusual achievement for a Filipino independent film. In a message to viewers after the screenings, Tarog noted:

Konkani phonology

Konkani is a southern Indo-Aryan language belonging to the Indo-European family of languages spoken in the Konkan coast of India. It has approximately 3.6 million speakers.
Konkani is the official language of the Indian state of Goa and a minority language in Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra, where Konkani speakers migrated during Bahamani, Maratha and Portuguese conquests. It is also one of the official languages of India.
This article is restricted to Konkani dialects spoken in the states of Goa, Karnataka and Kerala, where the largest number of Konkani speakers are found.
Structure.
Introduction.
Dialects.
The Goan standard dialect of Konkani, the Antruz dialect, is based on Goan Hindu Konkani which was originally the speech of the Hindus from the "Novas Conquistas", but it is now spoken by Hindus all over Goa with minor variations. It is also spoken by the Christians of the New Conquests who form a small percentage of the Goan Christians. The vast majority of Goan Christians live in areas called the "Velhas Conquistas". Their speech varies considerably from the speech of the Goan Hindus. They also speak two considerably different dialects: Bardes Christian dialect, spoken in Bardes and Tiswadi which form the northern part of the Old Conquests and Saxtti Christian dialect, spoken in Sashti and Mormugao which form the southern part of the Old Conquests. However, these two dialects have certain common features which can be referred to as Goan Christian Konkani features. The major Konkani dialects of Karnataka are the Karnataka Saraswat dialect, spoken by the Saraswat Brahmins of the coastal districts of Karnataka, and Karnataka Christian dialect, spoken by Christians in the coastal districts of Karnataka. The Saraswats and Christians of Karnataka also speak considerably different dialects since they came to Karnataka from different parts of Goa and at different times. The Saraswats came from southern Old Conquests (Sashti and Mormugao) in the sixteenth century because of Portuguese religious persecution. The Christians came in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries mainly from Bardes and Tiswadi.
Writings and Scripts.
A good number of writings are available in four of the dialects mentioned above: Goa Hindu, Bardes Christian, Canara Christian and Canara Saraswat. The Canara Saraswat dialect includes the speech of the Gaud Saraswats as well as that of the Chitrapur Saraswats as the differences between these two varieties of speech are minor. Sashti Christians generally use the Bardes dialect for writing. The Goan Hindus use the Devanagari script in their writings but the Goan Christians use the Roman script. The Saraswats of Karnataka use the Devanagari script in the North Canara district but the Kannada script in Udupi and South Canara . The Canara Christians use the Kannada script. The Devanagari script has been promulgated as the official script for Konkani in Goa.
The Standard Dialect.
Among the various Konkani dialects, the Konkani standard dialect, which is based on the Antruz Hindu dialect, has clearly emerged as the dominant dialect. It has several points in its favour. It is spoken by the majority of the Konkani speakers in Goa with minor variations. It has the best literature if not the most abundant. It has already established itself as the school dialect in Goa. The textbooks all the way up to the university level are in this dialect. It is used in the government offices of Goa where Konkani has been adopted as the official language of the state. It does not show as much regional diversity as the Goan Christian speech. It also occupies a middle position among the Konkani dialects of Goa and Karnataka without too many archaisms, innovations, or non-Sanskrit loans that might hamper cross-dialectal communication. The information in this article is based on the Goan standard dialect unless specified otherwise. The standard dialect will hereafter be referred to as Standard Konkani in this article.
Phoneme Inventory.
Konkani Phonemes (Standard Konkani).
The phonemes of Konkani are given below:
Vowels.
The vowels are called "svara" (svara-sound).
The long ("vhoḍ") vowels are about twice as long as the short ("sān") vowels. The diphthongs are usually pronounced about one and a half times as long as the short vowels, though most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.
The number of vowels in Konkani is a subject of debate. Sources argue for anywhere from 8 distinct vowels to 16 distinct vowels, not including an equal number of long vowels and nasal vowels. The following table shows one interpretation of the vowels found in the Konkani language, while the IPA Chart below the table shows another interpretation.
Following this is an IPA Chart for Konkani vowels:
Further complicating a consensus of the inventory of Konkani vowels is the varied use of vocabulary and phonemic change as a result of different dialects based on geographic or religious affiliation. Further research needs to be performed for satisfactory treatment of the subject, and the several dictionaries in existence must be concatenated to reach a standardization.
Konkani also has several Diphthongs, including the two that are standard to a large number of widely-spoken Indian languages, and .
Vowel Rounding in Christian Dialects.
In the Christian dialects (Bardes Christian and Saxtti Christian), there are fewer vowel phonemes as the vowel a has merged with o.
See table below:
Phonetic details and Phoneme Distribution.
General.
The alveolar and palatal stops are affricates. However, the phoneme is phonetically except word-initially, in gemination, and after a nasal. The consonants in the palatal column are alveopalatal except for the glides which are truly palatal. The sibilants becomes retroflex before a retroflex consonant. The retroflex voiced stops are pronounced as flaps except word-initially, in gemination, and after homorganic nasals. The voiced/voiceless contrast is found only in the stops and affricates. The sonorants are all voiced and the fricatives are all voiceless (except, of course, for which is a variant of ). The retroflex lateral does not occur word-initially.
In the Canara Saraswat dialect, all initial-syllable vowels in disyllabic words have longer variants before single consonants, e.g. "tīni" (three), "sūna" (daughter-in-law), "yēku" (one - masc.), "mōru" (peacock), "pāna" (leaf), etc. In all dialects, vowels have longer variants in monosyllables.
The Aspirate/ Non-aspirate Contrast.
The aspirate/non-aspirate contrast is found in all stops and affricates except for the voiceless labial stop as the old voiceless aspirated stop has changed into the fricative (f) in Standard Konkani. Some dialects have pʰ as well which freely alternates with ƒ. The aspirate/non-aspirate contrast is also found in the glides and in the non-retroflex nasals and laterals. The initial-syllable vowel is shortened after the aspirates and also after the fricatives. Aspirates in a non-initial position are usually found only in careful speech in the Goan standard dialect - mostly, in Sanskrit loans. In most dialects, aspirates occur only in the initial position. Even in the initial position, unaspirated consonants are substituted for aspirates in several dialects but the contrast is still maintained by retaining the shorter vowel in the initial syllable.
Palatalisation.
The Palatalised/Non-palatalised Contrast.
There is a palatalised/non-palatalised contrast in Konkani. The examples in the table below illustrate the formation of palatalised consonants. Palatalisation is indicated by [ ˡ ].
Replacement of an alveolar affricate or fricative by a palatal one.
In Konkani dialects other than Sashti Christian, the palatalised consonants occur only before the vowels a, o, and occasionally before u. In the Sashti Christian dialect, however, they also occur in the word-final position, e.g. ʋɑːtˡ (candle), mɑːrˡ (hit) second person singular imperative. Palatalised consonants contrast with unpalatalised consonant + y clusters.
Palatalised consonants and unpalatalised consonant plus y clusters.
Palatalised aspirates occur mostly in Sanskrit loans and most of these are found only in the intervocalic position. So, dialects which have aspirate consonants only in the initial position cannot have palatalised aspirates except the few that occur initially.
Oral And Nasal Vowel Contrast.
There is a contrast between oral and nasal vowels in Konkani. See the table below for examples:
Konkani is said to be a nasal language. In Konkani, nasality can spread from a nasal consonant or vowel through regressive assimilation across sonorants and glides through more than one syllable. In many languages, a nasal vowel is followed by a short homorganic nasal consonant before the following consonant. In Konkani this can occur even across a word boundary. Thus, un̥ɛ͂ kɐr ‘decrease’ can sound like (un̥ɛ͂ ŋkɐr). Vowel nasalization has come about through progressive assimilation as well. A word final vowel becomes nasal when it is preceded by a nasal consonant. This neutralizes the contrast between an oral vowel and a nasal vowel in the word-final position after a nasal consonant. For example, ordinarily, a class 1 adjective in Konkani ends in an oral vowel in masculine plural and feminine singular and in a nasal vowel in neuter singular and neuter plural. However, in the case of un̥o ‘less’, the masculine plural and the neuter singular both end up the same at the surface and the feminine singular and the neuter plural and the neuter plural forms also end up the same at the surface because of the spread of nasalisation from the nasal consonant to the word-final vowel.
Temporal Compensation.
According to what the phoneticians call the principle of temporal compensation, units of speech such as words tend to undergo quantitative adjustment so as to approach equal duration in a given environment although they might vary in terms of number of syllables as well as number of segments. The relatively short units stretch and the relatively long units contract in this process. Konkani is a good candidate to exemplify this principle.
ūṭ - get up
The morpheme uṭ is perceptibly longer in the monosyllabic 2nd person. sng. imperative form and perceptibly shorter in the trisyllabic 3rd per. sing fut. form than in the disyllabic 2nd per. pl. imperative and 3rd per. sing present imperfect forms. There is evidence from comparative data that this is a reflection of actual sound changes. The cognates of Konkani monosyllabic words like uṭ do not show any perceptible lengthening in related languages such as Hindi. The perceptible polysyllabic shortening characteristic of the Goan dialects of Konkani is absent even in the non-Goan dialects of Konkani.
The fact that such quantitative adjustment is not limited to the initial syllable can be seen from the examples in the table below:
Note the modification of the feminine -i nouns in the plural is 1. When the plural suffix -o is added, the stem-final -i remains a vowel in the case of the monosyllabic stems, but is reduced to a glide in the case of the disyllabic stems which have a single intervocalic consonant and to mere palatalization of the preceding consonant in the case of longer stems (i.e., disyllabic stems which have more than one consonant in the medial position and stems containing more than two syllables). The stem-final -u͂ behaves similarly in the neuter nouns in 2. When the plural suffix -a͂ is added, it remains a vowel in the case of the monosyllabic stems and is reduced to a glide in the case of the disyllabic stems which have a single intervocalic consonant. However, it is reduced to zero in the case of longer stems.
Glides before word-initial vowels.
Word-initially, front vowels are preceded by the palatal glide and back rounded vowels are preceded by the labio-velar glide in the Konkani dialects of Karnataka. This is a phonological characteristic of the South Dravidian languages which earlier prevailed also in Goa since Goa was ruled by Kannada dynasties for several centuries before the advent of the Portuguese. The Konkani dictionaries prepared by the Portuguese missionaries in the seventeenth century reflect the presence of such glides in Old Konkani.
Phonological rules and alternations.
The major phonological rules along with the alternations are based on or described in the following paragraphs:
Vowel height assimilation.
Lower mid vowels are replaced by higher mid vowels when a high vowel or higher mid vowel occurs in the next syllable; e.g. ‘fall’ (intransitive verb stem) paḍa-, 3rd per. sing. subjective paḍśī (< paḍaśī), 3rd per. sing. present imperfect paṭṭā (< paḍṭā < paḍtā); ‘break’ (intransitive verb stem) moḍa-, infinitive mōḍunk, (intransitive verb stem) moṭṭā (moḍṭā < moḍtā). This rule must apply prior to the vowel syncope rule with which it has a counter bleeding relationship.
Vowel rounding.
In the Canara Saraswat dialect, the vowel a is replaced by ō when the vowel u occurs in the following syllable, e.g. ‘do’ 2nd per sing imperative kari, first person singular optative kōrũ, infinitive kōrcāka (< kōruñcāka < karuścāka). In the Karnataka Christian dialect, the mid vowel a is replaced by o when a rounded vowel occurs in the following syllable, e.g. ‘do’ 2nd per sing imperative kar, first person singular optative kōrũ͂, infinitive karacāk (< karuñcāk).; ‘bud’ direct pl. kaḷe, direct singular kaḷo. In the Canara Saraswat dialect, the vowel rounding rule must apply prior to the vowel syncope rule, but in the Canara Christian dialect, it applies after the syncope rule.
Vowel syncope.
A vowel is deleted in a medial syllable (i.e., in the environment vowel consonant_consonant vowel) provided that there is no cluster of non-homorganic consonants next to it,
Reduction of high vowels before another vowel.
Under temporal compensation (see 1.3.5), it has been seen that the high vowels i/ī and u/ū are reduced to glides y and v respectively before another vowel when they occur in the second syllable after a single consonant. It has also been seen that they are further reduced to palatalisation (of the preceding consonant) and au respectively when they occur before another vowel in the second syllable after a consonant cluster or in a later syllable.
Final Vowel Elision.
In the Canara Saraswat dialect, any word taken in isolation ends in a vowel, but in connected speech all word-final vowels are elided in words containing more than one syllable when another word follows without a pause, e.g. hā̃va tākkā āppaytā̃ (hā̃va ‘I’, tākkā ‘him’, āppaytā̃ ‘call’) is pronounced as hā̃v tāk āppaytā̃. Such vowel elision in connected speech is found in the Sashti Christian dialect as well. In both dialects, if the elided vowel is a front vowel, the preceding consonant is palatalised.
Final vowel addition.
In the Karnataka dialects, a short predictable vowel [ i ] (high back rounded vowel) may optionally be added to words ending in a consonant. If the preceding consonant is y, this predictable vowel becomes i. If the preceding consonant is a labial, or if the vowel in the preceding syllable is rounded, the predictable vowel becomes u.
A word ending in a geminate stop must compulsorily add the predictable vowel at the end. Words do not normally end in a geminate stop except in some adjectives ending in a consonant. The final consonant can be geminated in order to convey an intensive meaning. Instead of a geminate, a homorganic nasal followed by the consonant is found in words in which the final consonant is preceded by a nasal vowel.
Yet another context in which such vowel addition is compulsory is the addition of the suffix -y ‘also’ or the emphatic suffix -c after a word. When one of these suffixes is added to a word, the word stress shifts from the initial syllable to the final syllable ending with one of these suffixes. If the word to which one of these suffixes is added ends in a vowel, no further vowel addition is necessary before the suffix, but if the word ends in a consonant then the predictable vowel must be added to it before adding the suffix. For example, nātū ‘grandson’, nātūc ‘the grandson himself’, nātūy ‘also the grandson’; nāt ‘granddaughter’, nātīc ‘the granddaughter herself’, nātīy ‘also the granddaughter’. The consonant of the emphatic suffix is often geminated, in which case, another predictable vowel gets added after the suffix. For example, nātūc~ nātūcci ‘the grandson himself’, nātīc ~ nātīcci ‘the granddaughter herself’.
Final vowel preservation in an accented syllable in the Sashti Christian dialect.
What might look like vowel addition in the Sashti Christian dialect before the suffix -y ‘also and the emphatic suffix -c, (corresponding to Karnataka Christian -tsa) and also at the end of a sentence with a yes-no question intonation, however, is not a case of vowel addition.
The vowels involved here are i, u and o. If a word ends in a palatalised consonant, the vowel that appears after it is predictably i. Elsewhere, the vowel u or o might appear. These vowels, however, are not phonetically predictable. What is here is a case of retention or preservation of vowels which have been lost in all other environments. There is historical and comparative evidence from Old Konkani and the Canara Saraswat dialect (which preserves the word-final short vowels of Old Konkani) that these vowels are original as can be seen in the table below.
Devoicing of stops.
Voiced stops are replaced by voiceless ones before voiceless consonants; e.g.

Horwood Bagshaw Ltd.

Horwood Bagshaw Ltd. is an Australian agricultural machinery manufacturer and dealership chain whose origins date from the late 1800s.
Horwood and Sons.
Joel Horwood (ca. 1800 – 18 May 1864) was a mechanical engineer who arrived in Adelaide, South Australia on the "Baboo" in 1848 and the following year founded the Colonial Iron Works in Hindley Street, Adelaide. At least three of his four sons were educated at J. L. Young's Adelaide Educational Institution; all followed in the same line of business, initially with him, then in different parts of Australia. As Horwood and Son, then Horwood & Sons, he was able to supply the burgeoning mining industry with urgently required parts, some of substantial size. With his death and changes in ownership, it became successively Horwood, Ellis & Stevens, Horwood & Ellis in 1866 then Ellis & Chittleborough in 1868. That firm failed and the business was taken over by James A Whitfield in 1869. Informative accounts of Adelaide's iron foundries and heavy engineering workshops of the period may be found here.
In 1856 his first son, also named Joel Horwood, opened a branch of Horwood & Sons in Vine Street, Bendigo (then called Sandhurst). He was a successful breeder of Shorthorn cattle and Cleveland and Clydesdale horses at his property "Bridgewater Park" on the River Loddon.
He died on 4 May 1900 aged 68 or 70 at his home "Glendure" on Myrtle Street Bendigo, survived by his second wife Rachelle. The foundry was taken over by the foreman Frank M. Brown in 1902 Joel (jnr)'s son Edward James Horwood was notable in Broken Hill, New South Wales as manager of BHP's mine works.
Joel Horwood's second son, Thomas Horwood (ca. 1829 – 12 August 1898), ran a Horwood and Son foundry at Wallaroo, ownership of which was taken over in 1869 by T. R. Heath. He continued to manage the business, then moved to Bendigo.
His fourth son, John William Horwood (ca. 1834 – 23 September 1915) returned to England in 1865 to study engineering and subsequently purchased the Albion Foundry in Castlemaine, Victoria.
J. H. Horwood and Co..
His third son, Joseph Henry Horwood (1841 – 17 April 1913) worked at the Bendigo Iron Works constructing mining equipment. He returned to Adelaide in 1867 to supply the Montacute goldmine with a ten head stamp battery, which he bought back the following year and installed at the Echunga goldmine. He then spent some time with his mining engineer brother John William Horwood in Castlemaine, Victoria before returning to Adelaide in 1872. He built a crushing plant in the Barossa Valley, then moved to Moonta to work on the copper mines, but withdrew in 1874 after being singled out for retribution for his part in suppressing the miners' strike. On 18 March 1875 he married Maria Brooks, and in the same year started work for Francis Clark & Sons, managing their machinery dealership on Grenfell Street then Blyth Street which they sold in 1882. He then joined Samuel Strapps to form a machinery manufacturing and sales business in Currie Street, bringing foreman Thomas Ward with him. Horwood's specialty was well-drilling and he built the first steam-powered rock drilling machine, as well as being a pioneer in tube-lined bores. His fence-wire tensioning device and windmills won several prizes at the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society shows. The business moved to Franklin Street in 1906 and became J. H. Horwood and Co. Ltd. in 1912. 
Horwood Bagshaw Ltd..
Joseph Henry's son, Horace R. Horwood (1885?–) was apprenticed to his father's company in 1903, and on completion became a salesman, selling farm machinery from the new Currie Street showrooms. In 1924, after acquiring J. S. Bagshaw & Sons Ltd, he was appointed General Sales Manager and director in the firm newly formed Horwood Bagshaw Ltd and retired in 1953.
Around 1960 the company acquired David Shearer Ltd of Mannum, South Australia.

Haifa derby

The Haifa derby is the name given to the football matches between Hapoel Haifa and Maccabi Haifa. As with any major football rivalry, gloating and banter between the two sets of fans is commonplace.
This rivalry between those two club has a long history, just like the clubs themselves. Hapoel Haifa was associated with the Israeli Labor Party and a socialist point of view, while Maccaby Haifa was known for middle class fans. In recent years these political differences have almost completely disappeared.
Israeli Premier League.
On June 18, 1949 the first game was held between the two clubs: Hapoel beat Maccabi 2–0. Since 1955 almost all the derbies took place in the municipal stadium – Kiryat Eliezer Stadium. The first game in that stadium ended with Maccabi winning 4–1. In 1967 was the first derby in Kiryat Haim Stadium (1–1). The aggregate score between the two teams is 132–97 to Maccabi Haifa.
State Cup.
The two clubs have met 14 times in the State Cup. Maccabi have won 8 games, and Hapoel have won 4. Two games ended with a penalty kick: once in 2000 when Macabbi won and managed to get the quarter final ticket (2–2 after 120 minutes), and in the second time in 2005 and Hapoel made it (after 3–3) to get the quarter final ticket. The teams have met twice in the final. In 1963, Hapoel Haifa won with a third minute goal from Simha Oren, and in 1995 Maccabi won 2–0 with goals from Moshe Glam and Ofer Shitrit.

National Union of Footwear, Leather and Allied Trades

The National Union of Footwear, Leather and Allied Trades (NUFLAT) was a trade union in the United Kingdom which existed between 1971 and 1991. It represented workers in the leather and footwear industry.
History.
The union was founded in 1971, with the merger of the Amalgamated Society of Leather Workers, the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, the National Union of Glovers and Leather Workers and the National Union of Leather Workers and Allied Trades. Although initially a strong union with many closed shop agreements, its membership fell rapidly due to large-scale redundancies in the industry. In 1991, it merged with the National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers to form the National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades. By the time of the merger, membership had fallen to 22,894.

Eberswalde Hauptbahnhof

Eberswalde Hauptbahnhof is historically the most important and now the only remaining station in the city of Eberswalde in the German state of Brandenburg. It was opened in the summer of 1842 outside the then city limits on the Berlin–Szczecin railway. The city fathers of Eberswalde did not want a modern railway in their city, so the station was built three kilometres west of the city centre in a wooded area where the Westend district is today.
Station.
Eberswalde was one of the first cities in Germany to be connected by rail. Seven years after the first German railway line was opened between Nuremberg and Fürth, it was then still unusual for German cities to be connected to the very new railway networks. It soon became clear that the development of the railway line was important for the supply of the city. In the following years the city grew mainly to the west towards the station, whose buildings were designed by F. Neuhaus. In 1867, a wooden bridge was built over the tracks.
On 1 May 1844 the following buildings and facilities were present at Eberswalde station:
Eberswalde has been a junction since 1866, when a line to Wriezen was opened; it was extended to Frankfurt (Oder) in 1876/77. The station was extended between 1866 and 1867. In 1873, a roundhouse was built with eight stalls and the old two-stall engine shed was demolished. On 7 January 1878, the repair shop of the Berlin-Stettin Railway Company () (now the Deutsche Bahn maintenance depot), was opened. Near the station, a line towards Joachimsthal and Templin was opened in 1898, starting from a junction at the nearby station of Britz on the Berlin–Szczecin line. Between 1906 and 1910, the station was remodelled extensively for the first time. It received several platforms, a pedestrian tunnel, a large lobby and several restaurants. In the following decades Eberswalde was a popular destination for Berliners and the station restaurants were especially well attended.
Because of the construction of the Westend district in 1904, a railway bridge was built in 1910 to replace the old wooden bridge. A trolley bus line (Gleislose Bahn Eberswalde) operated for a few months in 1901. From 1910 to 1940 an electric tramway (Straßenbahn Eberswalde) operated from Eberswalde Marktplatz (market place) to the station forecourt. In 1940 the tramway was converted into a trolley bus line, which is now the oldest existing trolley bus line in Germany.
Until about 2004, Eberswalde Station remained largely in its 1910 state, few improvements had taken place. The station facilities were mostly in a poor condition, so a complete reconstruction was then carried out, which involved the was moving of the tunnel to the north and the platforms to the south. The Eberswalde railway station bridge was demolished and replaced by a new structure. Only the main building of the former station is preserved. An old mechanical destination indicator, which is protected as a monument, has been returned to the platform.

Shareshill

Shareshill is a village and civil parish in the South Staffordshire district, in the county of Staffordshire, England. The parish church is dedicated to St Mary and St Luke, Shareshill.
Shareshill in 1851.
In 1851, Shareshill had 594 inhabitants and 4200 acres of land including 11 farmers, 2 malsters, a wheelwright, a dressmaker, 2 shopkeepers, 3 shoemakers, 1 butcher, 2 beerhouses (the Horse & Jockey and The Swan), 2 gentlemen and a schoolmistress. Lord Hatherton was lord of the manor, although some land was also owned by Major General Henry Charles W Vernon of nearby Hilton Park Hall, and onetime High Sheriff of Staffordshire, the Rev J L Petit and Alexander Hordern, Esq. Bordering the village are two rectangular archaeological vestiges of possibly Roman encampments. In the time of Henry IV, Shareshill was the seat of Sir William de Shareshill, who was also Sheriff of the county. The church has a reputedly very ancient tower and contains several curious antique monuments.

Yandanooka, Western Australia

Yandanooka is a small town in the Mid West region of Western Australia. The town is located between Mingenew and Three Springs on the Midlands Road.
The name of the town is Aboriginal in origin and is the name of the local water source and is thought to mean "plenty of hilly country in sight". The townsite was gazetted in 1919.
The first settler in the area was Thomas Whitfield in the 1950s and was a railway siding on the original route of the Midland Railway when opened in 1895. The siding was then moved 4 km to the South and land around the siding was set aside for a townsite. Lots were surveyed in 1913 then gazetted six years later.
In 1927 the town was suffering from a lack of accommodation and the locals presented a petition to the licensing board in Mingenew to open a hotel in town. Railway traffic had increased dramatically, in 1922 only 13,000 bags of wheat were sent by rail. This increased to 80,000 in 1925 and was expected to be over 100,000 in 1927.

Murgon fossil site

The Murgon fossil site is a paleontological site of early Eocene age in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. It lies near the town of Murgon, some 270 km north-west of Brisbane. The Murgon site is important as the only site on the continent with a diverse range of vertebrate fossils dating from the early Paleogene Period (55 million years ago, only 10 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs), making it a crucial period in mammal evolution. It is also important in demonstrating Australia's Gondwanan links with South America in the form of similar fossils from the two continents.
Geology.
Volcanic rock which has been estimated to be 40 million years old overlays the site. Therefore the Murgon fossils must be older than this.
The site is mostly clay which was laid down in a lake which formed in a volcanic crater.
Fossil fauna.
The fossil fauna reported from Murgon is referred to as the Tingamarra fauna. The most common fossil at the site are of crocodiles and giant trionychidae turtles which have become extinct in Australia. Fossils from Murgon include the world's oldest songbirds, the oldest Australian marsupials, the only known fossils of leiopelmatid frogs, and the only Australian fossil salamanders. Evidence of the Gondwanan connection comes with the appearance of a madstoiid snake in the genus "Alamitophis", also found in Argentina, and of microbiotheriid marsupials, otherwise only known from South America. The earliest Australian frog fossil was found there.
Other notable examples of the Tingamarra fauna from Murgon are:
Because of closer links between current South American species than ancient Australian families, it has been hypothesised that there must have been large exchanges of species between continents when they were once linked by Antarctica.
After the discoveries at this site, no mammalian fossils have been identified in the following 30 million years.

Studio Theatre in Łódź

The Studio Theatre in Łódź () is one of the oldest theatres in Łódź (Poland), having been built in 1870. Since 1998, it was managed by the Leon Schiller National Higher School of Film, Television and Theatre, and in 2002 the theatre became the school's property.
History.
The theatre was built in 1870 in Łódź in the times of Russia-dependent Kingdom of Poland. It was one of many cultural – utilitarian institutions set up in Łódź at that time because of the rapid development of the town and the growth of its significance as one of the major cultural and industrial centres of the Kingdom. From the beginning of its activity, through years leading to the outbreak of World War I the theatre was staging mainly Russian plays due to strong influence of the Russian Empire on the Polish culture. After the war when Poland regained independence the theatre was sidelined from the main course of Łódź cultural life due to poor management which resulted in considerable debt. The building itself was used as a storage by the owners of an adjacent store. During the World War II the theatre edifice was destroyed sharing the fate of most of the Łódź's development. The early post-war years marked the repeated heyday of the theatre. In 1958 it was renamed the Theatre of Łódź's Soil (Teatr Ziemi Łódzkiej) and linked with the Leon Schiller National Higher School of Film, Television and Theatre established in 1948. From the beginning of its activity, the school educated the new generation of Polish artists called The Polish Film School. Among the alumni were such distinguished artists like Roman Polański, Andrzej Wajda, Krzysztof Kieslowski and many others. Most of them made their debuts on the stage of the theatre. In 1983 the theatre was renamed as Julian Tuwim's Studio Theatre (Teatr Studyjny im. Juliana Tuwima). In 2002, as the Studio Theatre, it officially became the property of the Leon Schiller National Film School.
Current Affairs.
Since 2002 the 4th year students of the Acting Department prepare and present their graduation spectacles as well as engage in their independent artistic projects. Apart from being the place of teaching and presentation, the Studio Theatre is also a place in which various research and artistic projects are carried out for instance: The Festival of Theatrical Schools, Workshops of the European Theatrical Schools, Drama Workshops "Drama in Progress". In the recent years the plays staged at Studio Theatre not only gained liking and recognition among the young audience but also managed to meet the expectations of the drama critics in Poland and in Europe. In 2006 for the first time in history Studio Theatre was awarded The Golden Mask award by the Polish Critics Association for the best play for the spectacle of Sergi Belbel's "Łoże" directed by Karolina Szymczak. The theatre has two scenes which can seat 120 and 60 audience members.
Notable recent plays.
Nikolai Gogol's "Marriage".
Dir. Georgy Lifanov
A hilarious comedy full of unexpected twists and surprising feature outcomes. Ivan Podkolyosin, an elderly bachelor occupying a prestigious clerical position, upon being strongly encouraged by his close friend, decides to get married. He adopts a peculiar approach to the subject and when he finally makes a decision to step into holy matrimony, in a final moment of prenuptial solitude he arrives at a conclusion that marriage is the most wonderful thing in the world and regrets the wasted time. Right afterwards, upon cooling down he commits an act which can be commented with a proverb: "Do as you’d be done by". "Marriage" is a play that constantly remains popular. It shows the matrimonial stock exchange on which one can gain fortune but be disillusioned. It is also full of contradictions, witty dialogs and superbly developed characters.

Urs Widmer's "Top Dogs".
dir. Marcin Brzozowski
"Top Dogs – top price class" – people representing the management. They used to be the top players in the game but now they are obsolete. Once they have lost their jobs, their lives fell apart. Some of them still cannot come to terms with reality. They cannot believe that they ended up on the street after losing in the ruthless rat race. They meet in a peculiar place, something between employment agency and a therapy group. They are work-a-holics on rehab desperately trying to find a new meaning to their existence. 
Top Dogs is a psychodrama which holds the characters hostage, strips them of the lies and illusions which they are feeding each other. It brings out their secrets and deeply concealed thoughts which the characters were frantically trying to bury in their memories. However, the therapy is perverse. On one hand it teaches them how to survive in the new circumstances but on the other it maintains their love for money, power and career.

A loony play by a modern Czech playwright and director Petr Zelenka depicts the intense and complicated male – female relations in which solitude and the power of love are key factors. The forlorn, misunderstood, lonely and unloved characters of this absurd comedy filled with surrealist sense of humour desperately seek happiness, love and meaning of life. To regain the lost order and sanity they cling to the most risky and magical ways to turn their lives around. As a result they sink deeper into madness. Madness, which is not at all gloomy, scary and desolating, but instead more ordinary, more human, less bitter. It is a madness experienced sometimes by each and every one of us.

National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers

The National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers (NUHKW) was a trade union in the United Kingdom.
History.
The union was founded in 1945, with the merger of the Hinckley, Ilkeston, Leicester, Loughborough and Nottingham Hosiery Unions. Shortly after, most Scottish unions voted to join the new organisation. Sections were also created for northern and southern England and, by the end of the year, it had 22,430 members. The following year, it secured a national agreement limiting night work and restricting total working to 45 hours per week.
In 1970, a threat of national strike action secured a 10% wage increase and the abandonment of plans for a continuous shift system. Membership of the union continued to grow, reaching a peak of 74,077 in 1977. Several small unions affiliated, the most notable being the Amalgamated Society of Operative Lace Makers and Textile Workers. However, widespread redundancies in the sector began reducing membership. In 1991, it merged with the National Union of Footwear, Leather and Allied Trades, with 34,183 members remaining to join the new National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades.

Siemens (unit)

The siemens (SI unit symbol: S) is the unit of electric conductance and electric admittance in the International System of Units (SI). Conductance and admittance are the reciprocals of resistance and impedance respectively, hence one siemens is equal to the reciprocal of one ohm, and is also referred to as the "mho". The 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures approved the addition of the siemens as a derived unit in 1971.
The unit is named after Ernst Werner von Siemens. As with every SI unit whose name is derived from the proper name of a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (S); the lower-case "s" is the symbol for the second. When an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower-case letter ("siemens"), except where "any" word would be capitalized. In English, the same form "siemens" is used both for the singular and plural.
Definition.
For a conducting or semiconducting element with electrical resistance "R", the conductance "G", is defined as
where "I" is the electric current through the object and "V" is the voltage (electrical potential difference) across the object.
The unit siemens for the conductance "G" is defined by
where Ω is the ohm, A is the ampere, and V is the volt.
For a device with a conductance of one siemens, the electric current through the device will increase by one ampere for every increase of one volt of electric potential difference across the device.
The conductance of a resistor with a resistance of five ohms, for example, is (5 Ω)−1, which is equal to 200 mS.
Mho.
Mho is an alternative name of the same unit, the reciprocal of one ohm. Mho is derived from spelling "ohm" backwards and is written with an upside-down capital Greek letter Omega: formula_3, Unicode symbol U+2127 (). According to Maver the term "mho" was suggested by Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). The "mho" was officially renamed to the "siemens", replacing the old meaning of the ""siemens" unit", at a conference in 1881.
The term "siemens", as it is a SI term, is used universally in science and often in electrical applications, while "mho" is still used primarily in electronic applications. The inverted Omega, while not an official SI abbreviation, has the advantage of being less likely to be confused with a variable than the letter S when doing algebraic calculations by hand, where the usual typographical distinctions (such as italic for variables and Roman for unit names) are difficult to maintain. Likewise, it is difficult to distinguish the symbol "S" from the lower-case "s" where "second" is meant, potentially causing confusion.

1924 Imperial Airways de Havilland DH.34 crash

The 1924 Imperial Airways de Havilland DH.34 crash occurred on 24 December 1924 when de Havilland DH.34 G-EBBX of Imperial Airways crashed at Purley, Surrey, United Kingdom killing all eight people on board. The aircraft was operating a scheduled international flight from Croydon, Surrey, to Paris, France. It was the first fatal accident suffered by Imperial Airways and led to the first public inquiry into a civil aviation accident in the United Kingdom. As a result of issues brought up during the Public Inquiry, Croydon Airport was expanded, absorbing most of Beddington Aerodrome.
Aircraft.
The aircraft involved was de Havilland DH.34 G-EBBX, c/n 35. The aircraft had been in service since 6 March 1922. It was owned by the Air Council and had been leased to Daimler Hire Ltd, passing to Imperial Airways when that airline was formed in March 1924. It had been manufactured in 1922, and the first certificate of airworthiness had been issued on 19 September. In April 1924, a new set of wings had been fitted to the aircraft. These wings were of a different type to the standard wings. A new certificate of airworthiness had been issued on 29 April. On 12 May, the aircraft was involved in a ground collision with a searchlight at an unnamed airfield, damaging the wings. The aircraft was subsequently refitted with standard wings, and a new certificate of airworthiness was issued on 24 November.
Accident.
The aircraft took off from Croydon Airport on a scheduled international passenger flight to Le Bourget Airport, Paris. Witnesses described the aircraft as flying low over Purley before nosediving to the ground, and overturning. The crash was followed by an explosion and fire. The crash site was from Croydon Airport, at Castle Hill, Purley, where the Kingsdown housing estate was then under construction. Attempts to rescue those on board were made, but the intensity of the fire made this task impossible. A witness stated that he thought the accident was unsurvivable. It was only after the local fire brigade had extinguished the fire that the bodies of the victims could be extricated from the wreckage. The accident was the first fatal accident suffered by Imperial Airways. The aircraft was insured with the British Aviation Insurance Group. A successful claim was made by Imperial Airways following the loss of the aircraft.
Inquest.
An inquest was opened in Croydon on 29 December. Identification evidence was heard, following which witness and pathological evidence was heard and the inquest was then adjourned until 9 January 1925. When the inquest resumed evidence was heard that in the days before the accident, the engine on G-EBBX had been running roughly with fluctuating oil pressure. A witness described hearing the engine making a rattling noise shortly before the aircraft nosedived. Another witness, a rigger in the employ of Imperial Airways stated that he heard nothing unusual with the engine noise, although he stated that the aircraft had stalled from an altitude of . A witness who saw the take-off from Croydon stated that the take-off run was long, at and that the aircraft only gained height slowly. The following aircraft also performed similarly. Before the inquest had started, Major Brackley, an official of Imperial Airways based at Croydon Airport, had remarked that all aircraft that day had not lifted off easily. Rain in the days before the accident had left the grass runways sodden, which would have caused heavy aircraft to sink in and retarded acceleration on take-off. The aircraft had taken off uphill, which would also have retarded acceleration. After hearing further eyewitness evidence, the inquest was adjourned until 14 January.
At the resumption of the inquest, it was announced that a public inquiry was to be held into the accident. An allegation that Imperial Airways had attempted to interfere with a witness was not upheld by the Coroner. Evidence was then given about the manner of the take-off, and the firmness of the grass runway. The aircraft took off with a payload of , just under the maximum allowable . Major Cooper, the officer investigating the accident for the Accidents Investigation Branch, gave evidence that in his opinion there was no mechanical defect with the engine that could have caused the accident. The inquest was then adjourned until 21 January. On the resumption of the inquest, the Coroner announced that as a result of fresh evidence being available, coupled with Major Woods-Humphreys, the General Manager of Imperial Airways, being taken ill, the inquest would be further adjourned until 12 February. When the inquest resumed, the Public Inquiry had concluded. The Coroner remarked that evidence from the Public Inquiry showed that there was no case for criminal negligence verdicts to be given. Major Cooper was then re-called and gave evidence confirming the result of the public inquiry. The jury stated that they had heard enough evidence to be in a position to give a verdict. After a brief adjournment and legal arguments, the inquest was adjourned until 18 February. A verdict of misadventure was given.
Public Inquiry.
An investigation was opened into the accident by the Accidents Investigation Branch. Under directions from Sir Sefton Brancker, a Public Inquiry was held, chaired by Sir Arthur Colefax, with Professor B M Jones and James Swinburne as assessors. The enquiry opened on 23 January 1925 at the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London. This was the first Public Inquiry into a civil aviation accident in the United Kingdom. The inquiry was held under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Act, 1920, as amended in 1922. Evidence was given that the aircraft had a valid certificate of airworthiness and that at the time of the accident it was operating in an unmodified form. The aircraft was not overloaded and had been inspected on the morning of the day the accident occurred. Reported problems with the lubrication system on the Napier Lion engine had been rectified. Failure of the aircraft to reach its intended destinations in the week before the accident had been entirely due to weather conditions, and not as the result of any mechanical defect. The pilot, David Stewart, had served with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force, having been awarded the Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Force Cross. He had been a pilot since 1917. Evidence was given that a petrol pipe recovered from the wreckage was discovered to be partially obstructed internally. The possibility of this occurring before the crash could not be dismissed, although the obstruction could also have been as a result of the post-crash fire. The inquiry was then adjourned until 25 January.
On day two of the inquiry, Major Cooper gave evidence in respect of the flight of the aircraft, based on interviews with between 100 and 150 witnesses. He stated that the final manoeuvring of the aircraft was consistent with the pilot experiencing engine trouble and attempting to return to Croydon Airport. He stated that it was impossible to state that the engine had suffered a partial failure due to the partial obstruction of the petrol pipe. In the week before the crash, the aircraft had been away from Croydon for six days, having landed at Amsterdam, the Netherland, Ostend, Belgium and Lympne, Kent, before returning to Croydon on the morning of 24 December. No licenced engineer was available at any of the airports away from Croydon. On arrival at Croydon, the engine was reported to be running rough. Routine servicing was carried out and the oil tank drained and refilled with fresh oil. The engine had then been ground tested, including being run for 20 minutes. Major Cooper opined that further investigation should have been undertaken given the report of rough running. It was revealed that a chart recording engine speeds during a flight from Ostend to Lympne was available, but Major Cooper had chosen not to analyse it. Sir Arthur Colefax stated that he would arrange for the document to be analysed to see if it would reveal any rough running in the engine. Evidence was given in respect of the petrol pipe. Major Cooper stated that it would not have been passed as fit for use in military aircraft, due to its construction. The inquiry was adjourned until 27 January.
On the third day of the enquiry, evidence was given that the engine chart did not show any problems with the engine on the flight between Ostend and Lympne, or on the subsequent flight from Lympne to Croydon. Captain Bert Hinchcliffe, who was the pilot of the aircraft on those flights gave evidence that the oil pressure had fluctuated on the flight on 18 December from Croydon to Amsterdam. He had reported the problem to a mechanic on arrival at Amsterdam, but was due to return to Croydon within the hour. On the return flight, the oil pressure had dropped to about half an hour after departure. He had continued for a while, then returned to Amsterdam due to weather conditions. The engine was overhauled by a mechanic, but fog prevented the aircraft departing until 23 December when Hinchcliffe flew to Ostend, where the aircraft was refuelled. Hinchcliffe did not report any problem with the engine to the engineer at Ostend. and then on to Lympne. During these flights, oil pressure was maintained at at least , although it still fluctuated. The engine was reported to still be running rough. On the morning of 24 December, he flew from Lympne to Croydon. The Amsterdam-based mechanic gave evidence that he had changed all 24 spark plugs on the engine and that a half-hour test flight had then been flown. Evidence was given by Captain F. L. Barnard, who had taken off from Croydon on a flight to Paris in DH.34 G-EBBY shortly after the accident occurred. He had radioed that he thought that aircraft should not be loaded so heavily as it was. The engineer at Croydon gave evidence that the engine was worked on and that ground testing showed that it maintained an oil pressure of during 20 minutes running, including some bursts of full throttle. The inspection and work having taken an hour and ten minutes. The inquiry was then adjourned until the following day.
On day four of the enquiry, evidence was given by Imperial Airways Inspector of Engines that no example of the petrol pipe used on the aircraft had been rejected due to internal obstruction leading to reduced flow of fuel. He stated that he was satisfied that the engine was serviceable at the time of departure. Captain Barnard, who flew G-EBBY to Paris shortly after the accident had occurred, disagreed with a suggestion put to him that there was a problem with the engine, saying that he did not think anyone could give a cause for the crash, other than the aircraft having stalled. Further evidence was heard as to the loading of the aircraft. The maintenance regime at Imperial Airways and the reliability of the de Havilland DH.34 were called into question by Mr Beyfus, a legal representative of one of the victims. Two witnesses from the aircraft's insurers gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was to the company's satisfaction. The Imperial Airways manager at Amsterdam corroborated Hinchcliffe's earlier evidence. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.
On the fifth day of the enquiry, Managing Director of Imperial Airways Colonel Frank Searle gave evidence that Imperial Airways pilots had absolute discretion to refuse to fly any aircraft if, in their opinion, the aircraft was unfit for flight for whatever reason. He stated that the petrol pipe supplied by Petro-Flex to Imperial Airways was of an armoured type, but that unarmoured pipes had been fitted to some aircraft taken over when Imperial Airways had been formed, and that spares from these companies were in stock and being used. Both armoured and unarmoured pipes had been approved for use by the Air Ministry. A representative from Petro-Flex corroborated Searle's evidence in respect of the type of piping supplied to Imperial Airways. Evidence was given that the flight from Lympne to Croydon was with the aircraft lightly loaded, and that the performance of the engine with a restricted fuel pipe would be different from that with a full load. The Chief Engineer of Napier & Son gave evidence that Imperial Airways maintenance regime was of the highest standard. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.
On day six of the inquiry, Mr Beyfus further attempted to call into question Imperial Airways maintenance regime, and the safety of the de Havilland DH.34. The suitability of Croydon Airport for operation of airliners was also called into question. It was suggested that the runway should be extended by to ensure safety. The inquiry was adjourned until the 2 February.
On the seventh day of the inquiry, it was announced that Croydon Airport was to be extended, with of the neighbouring Beddington Aerodrome being absorbed into the current airfield, Plough Lane being diverted to allow this. An Act of Parliament would be needed before the expansion could take place, for which a bill was in preparation. Finance had been allocated to allow the expansion. Evidence was heard that Croydon was then considered to be the most suitable location for an airport to serve London. Further evidence was heard about the Napier Lion engine, with Mr Beyfus again calling into question the maintenance regime at Imperial Airways, calling the engine "a veritable Cassandra", issuing warnings for seven days that had gone unheeded except by Hinchcliffe. Beyfus denied that his line of questioning was in order to obstruct the inquiry in its investigation, but stated that as the Air Ministry oversaw civil aviation, it was not entirely "amicus curiae" in the matter. Counsel for Imperial Airways stated that Beyfus representing a victim of the accident was a front, and that he was really there to represent the interests of certain persons present at the inquiry who had declined to give evidence themselves. He submitted that the accident was caused by weather conditions, and not by any problem with the engine. The inquiry was then adjourned until the next day.
On day eight of the inquiry, various submissions were made to the inquiry in respect of the petrol pipe, the relationship between the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways and the licencing of engineers abroad. Mr Beyfus's allegations were rejected by the inquiry, which found that the Air Ministry had acted properly in matters under its jurisdiction. Sir Arthur Colefax stated that he and his advisors would visit Croydon Airport before publishing the report into the accident.
The report into the inquiry was published on 10 February 1925. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft was airworthy at the time of departure. There was no blockage in the petrol pipe, such damage being as a result of the firefighting operations subsequent to the crash. The use of unarmoured pipe had been allowed by Air Ministry officials who were unaware of an instruction issued on 6 December 1923 that armoured piping was to be used. Such usage of non-armoured piping had no relevance to the accident. The then-current conditions existing at Croydon Airport meant that pilots were unable to comply with certain parts of the Air Navigation (Consolidation) Order, 1923 and that the condition of the airfield was at least a contributory factor in the accident. It also found that clarification of the meaning of the word "flight" in parts of the order was needed. No negligence was found on the part of the Air Ministry or Imperial Airways. The pilot was cleared of blame for the accident. The aircraft was found to have crashed due to an unknown mechanical defect and subsequent stall whilst an emergency landing was being attempted.
Casualties.
The nationalities of the casualties were:-

Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia

The Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia was founded in November 1839 as the South Australian Agricultural Society with the aim of promoting primary industries in the Colony. The Society and its functions were patterned on similar organisations in England, and in its successive incarnations, the organisation has continued to pursue this aim (in the State) to the current day.
History.
Foundation.
The South Australian Agricultural Society was founded as the result of a public meeting held on 28 October 1839.
The original Constitution provided for a President, four Vice-Presidents, Hon. Secretary, Hon. Treasurer and a committee of 18 citizens selected by a formula intended to give representation to the range of members' interests and locations, one third of whom were to retire annually by rotation. At some later stage, the committee increased to 40.
Governor Gawler accepted nomination as Patron.
On 23 November a group, discontented with the way membership of the Society had dropped away, resolved to re-inaugurate the Society as though it no longer existed. They advertised for a public meeting to be held on 6 December 1840 at Fordham's Hotel, conducted by a steering committee consisting of:
Agricultural and Horticultural Society.
On 24 January 1842 a meeting was held at the Mayor (Thomas Wilson)'s chambers to form the South Australian Agricultural and Horticultural Society.
Turmoil.
In February 1843 there was a popular feeling that the Society had been negligent in preparing for the Autumn Show. J. Bentham Neales offered the use of his auction yard as the venue, perhaps to stimulate some activity. (It was held, on 17 March, but only made possible by donations solicited by John Morphett from wealthy friends, as the Society had no funds.)
In August 1843 James Frew, president of the Ploughing Match Society met with others to change the name of his society to the South Australian Agricultural Society (the original title of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society), and possibly to conduct shows of animals and produce. Under that name, the society conducted ploughing matches on 1 September 1843 The two organizations differed in their memberships: the S.A.A.& H.S. was largely composed of men of wealtth and influence while the Ploughing Match Society/S.A.A.S. was more oriented to the practical farmer. Among their members were:
A meeting was called by officials of the S.A.A.& H.S. for Saturday 27 April 1844 to resolve the situation that, even if the two bodies could coexist, the similarity of their titles would be confusing to the public.
The Annual General Meeting of the Agricultural Society at Payne's Hotel on 7 May 1844 commenced with the chairman Mr Frew detailing activities of the previous year - (besides the ploughing match on 1 September, a Cattle Show on 20 October and exhibition of produce on 14 February) and looked forward to an Agricultural Show in September, in competition with that of the R.A.& H.S. Conceding that unification was necessary, he argued that the only way it could occur was by members of the other Society changing sides. The tone of the meeting changed however when Mr Lambert and Mr Harkness spoke in favour of union, with the proviso that Mr. Wotherspoon should by the Secretary of the unified Society.
Royal Patronage.
In April 1868, following the highly successful Grand Exhibition, at which he was guest of honour, the Duke of Edinburgh accepted the role of Patron of the Society, which then became the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia.

Activities.
The Society's most visible activities were the Shows and Exhibitions, but also contributed in other ways:
Ploughing Matches.
This event, as popularized in England, had teams of horses or bullocks competing and were judged on the straightness and uniformity of depth of the furrow and the way the earth was turned over, and of course the time for the team to complete its allocated area. Prizes were allocated according to divisions which reflected the class of ploughing team. Difficulties in organising such events included finding sufficient area of uniform consistency to give ensure fair competition and having had sufficient rain that the ground was not impossibly hard and yet not boggy. The first such organised in South Australia was by the South Australian Agricultural Society in September 1843 and attracted considerable public interest and was emulated by many of the regional agricultural societies.
Country Societies.
During the 19th and early 20th centuries many South Australian country centres formed societies with similar aims, following the British model. These included:

Bill Bailey (surfer)

Bill Bailey (27 September 1933 - 28 April 2009) was known as "the father of British surfing" for the crucial role he played in the development of the sport in the United Kingdom. He set up the first surf company in Britain.
Bailey grew up in Inglesbatch, in Somerset where his father withdrew him from school at age 14 due to his behaviour, and placed him in the Royal Air Force. There he trained as an engineer working on Short Sunderland flying boats and taking postings overseas. It was while working on air-sea rescue in Sri Lanka that he developed a love of the sea, quitting the air-force at the end of the 1950s and moving to Newquay to work as a lifeguard.
Bailey began building life-saving equipment including a surf ski in 1961, designed to be used by to lifeguards with paddles. While tinkering with the design he met two Australians on their way to the US, and was impressed with the foam core and fibre-glass construction of their surf boards. He bought one and learned to use it, becoming one of the first native surfers in Britain. In 1964 he began constructing surf boards himself and the following year formed a partnership with Bob Head to set up the European Surfing Company. Under its surfboard brand, BilBo, it produced around 12,000 boards over the next eight years. In the late 1960s A Bilbo shop was opened outside the train station of Newquay, which was quickly becoming the UK surfing capital.

Blooded (film)

Blooded is a 2011 British independent horror/thriller film. Written by James Walker, and produced by Magma Pictures and Ptarmigan ACP, it is the directorial debut of Edward Boase. The film premiered at the Bradford International Film Festival on 18 March 2011.
The plot involves an animal rights action group calling themselves the "Real Animal League", which kidnaps five young deer hunters and then hunts them. It is filmed in a mockumentary style, imitating a real documentary film. As part of the promotion, distributor Revolver Entertainment created a website, realanimalleague.com, for the fictional Real Animal League (RAL), which mentions the film. An email statement to the real animal rights group, Animal Liberation Front (ALF), supposedly from the RAL claiming that the film misrepresented them, was reprinted on the ALF website. The "Evening Standard" reported that the film "caused outrage after graphic scenes showing activists attacking five deer-stalkers were posted on the internet, in a viral publicity campaign," and the film's topic has provoked reactions from parties on both side of the hunting debate in the UK.
Synopsis.
Filming was completed in 2009, shot in a mockumentary style, imitating a real documentary film. It presents fictional events as though real, using interviews, and internet footage. The plot involves a group of five young deer hunters on a hunt in Scotland. Eve Jourdan (Tracy Ifeachor) bags a deer and is "blooded", a hunting ritual where the blood of a first kill is smeared on a hunter's face. The following morning, an extremist animal rights action group calling themselves the "Real Animal League", kidnaps the five, strips them to their underwear, and leaves each alone in different locations across the hills, setting them as prey of other hunters. The league films the events in first person style as the five become the "game" in a hunt, with the intention of using the footage as a warning to other hunters. It is their "documentary" footage that is the basis of the film.
Promotion.
As part of the film promotion, Revolver Entertainment created a website for the fictional Real Animal League (RAL), and a YouTube channel for the RAL, which both mentioned the film. According to director Edward Boase, the production company created the appearance of a "fully-fledged animal rights website", with links to real organisations in order to make the fake organisation appear authentic, but "not to the point where you couldn't find out that it wasn't real." As reported in "First Post", the hunting incident in the film was fictional, there was no kidnapping, and there is no organisation called the "Real Animal League". Revolver Entertainment's marketing department sent an email statement to the real animal rights group, Animal Liberation Front (ALF), supposedly from the Real Animal League, claiming that the film misrepresented the RAL. The email was reprinted in its entirety on the ALF website. When the event and RAL were revealed as fictional, and after thousands of complaints, YouTube deemed the videos as inappropriate and removed the footage that had been posted under the guise of the Real Animal League of the film's protagonists being chased and forced into confessions, and subsequently deactivated the YouTube channel of the fictional RAL.
Release.
"Blooded" premiered at the Bradford International Film Festival on 18 March 2011. It will have limited release in select theatres and on-demand services on 1 April 2011. A DVD release is planned for 4 April 2011, which will include extras such as commentary by film makers, extended interviews, the "making of "Blooded"", and the short film "Home Video" by Ed Boase.
Critical response.
The film's topic has provoked reactions from parties on both side of the hunting debate in the UK. In promoting the film, its makers originally asserted that it was a re-creation of an actual event that occurred after the enactment of the 2005 hunting ban in England, maintaining that the film, rather than trying to make any political points, only investigates "the nature of extremism" in any form, and "encourages debate".
The "Evening Standard" wrote that the film "caused outrage after graphic scenes showing activists attacking five deer-stalkers were posted on the internet, in a viral publicity campaign."
"The Independent" noted the film's controversial stance, and that as the film's asserted protagonists were a group of extreme animal activists, it generated "much chatter on the interweb" after clips appeared on Youtube. They wrote however, "it all has the whiff of a clever publicity stunt". This is a stance echoed in many other online reviews with suggestions that it is a mockumentary that leaves the viewer with "no doubt that it is fabricated". A website called "Film Pilgrim". for example, noted that the project first began as an online viral video, but was expanded into a feature film, writing that the expanded footage "has many people debating about the authenticity of the footage." They praised the film's score, writing "The soundtrack for "Blooded" is one of its most rewarding elements", being "the bulk of the glue that holds the film together." They offered that the "idea of turning an internet viral video into a feature film/documentary is a pretty interesting concept", but that the film fell flat stylistically in that the "reconstructed footage feels like an actual film which detracts from the realism that the original virals created". They speculated in their review that there was in fact no such organization as the "Real Animal League" at all, and that the film was created as a hoax in the "Blair Witch" tradition.
"The List" classed it as an example of a "fantastic piece of filmmaking that shows what is achievable if you get creative within your budget".
Soundtrack.
The film's soundtrack was created by award-winning and Ivor Novello-nominated composer Ilan Eshkeri and Jeff Toyne. The score was recorded by the London Metropolitan Orchestra at British Grove Studios and mixed by Steve McLaughlin.

Jennifer Lopez filmography

American actress Jennifer Lopez has appeared in many motion pictures and television programs. She is one of the highest paid actresses in Hollywood and is the highest paid actor of Latin descent, making up to US$15 million per film role. In addition, she is also the richest actress in Hollywood, with an estimated net worth of $250 million (2013). Lopez made her acting debut at age 16 with a small role in the 1986 film "My Little Girl". From there, she received her first high-profile job in 1991 as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program "In Living Color". Following her departure from the show in 1993, Lopez made several guest appearances in the television series "South Central", appeared in the made-for-television movie "Lost in the Wild" (1993) and starred as Melinda Lopez in the television series "Second Chances" (1993) and its spin-off "Hotel Malibu" (1994). "Second Chances" and "Hotel Malibu" ran for only a brief period, receiving negative reviews. Lopez's first major film role came in the 1995 motion picture "Money Train", alongside Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson. The film faced negative reviews and is considered to be a box office bomb. Her next two film roles in "Jack" (1996) and "Blood and Wine" (1997) were received similarly; however, critics were divided by the latter. Lopez received her first leading role in the Selena biopic of the same name in 1997. The film was a commercial and critical success and is often cited by critics as her breakout role. Later that year, Lopez starred as Terri Flores in the film "Anaconda", which garnered negative reviews by critics despite being a box office success. In 1998, Lopez starred alongside George Clooney in the crime film "Out of Sight" (1998). The film met with positive reviews and was a box office success. In the same year, she also lent her voice to the animated film "Antz".
Following the launch of her music career in 1999, Lopez returned to the big screen as the star of the 2000 psychological thriller "The Cell". In 2001, Lopez starred in the films "The Wedding Planner" and "Angel Eyes", which were received unfavorably. The simultaneous release of "The Wedding Planner" and her second album "J.Lo" made Lopez the first person in history to have a number one album and film in the same week. Lopez starred alongside Ralph Fiennes in the romantic comedy "Maid in Manhattan" in 2002. The film received mixed reviews, despite its box office success. In 2003 and 2004 she starred alongside then-boyfriend Ben Affleck in the films "Gigli" and "Jersey Girl". Critics wrote negatively for both films, and "Gigli" is considered one of the worst films of all time. Lopez retained box office success co-starring in the 2004 film "Shall We Dance?" alongside Richard Gere. She then co-starred opposite Jane Fonda in the romantic comedy "Monster-in-Law" (2005). Following the role, Lopez starred in the independent films "An Unfinished Life" (2005), "Bordertown" (2006) and "El Cantante" (2006); she also acted as the executive producer of the latter. In 2006 and 2007 Lopez worked further behind the scenes as an executive producer of the television series "South Beach" and "DanceLife", the film "Feel the Noise" and the mini-series "".
Following the birth of her twins in 2008, Lopez took a break from her career. She made her return to the small screen and the big screen in 2010, making a guest appearance in an episode of "How I Met Your Mother" and starring in the film "The Back-up Plan". In 2011 and 2012, during their tenth and eleventh seasons, Lopez was a judge on the reality television singing competition "American Idol". She earned a reported $12 million for her first and $20 million for her second season on the show. In 2012, she launched "¡Q'Viva! The Chosen", a talent show created by Simon Fuller, that followed Lopez, Marc Anthony and director-choeographer Jamie King as they travelled across 21 Latin American countries to find talent for a Las Vegas show. Lopez co-starred alongside an ensemble cast consisting of Cameron Diaz, Elizabeth Banks, Matthew Morrison and Dennis Quaid in the film "What to Expect When You're Expecting" (2012). The film, which is based on the book of the same name, was a moderate commercial success and received generally negative reviews from film critics. Later that same year, she lent her voice to the animated film, "", the fourth in the "Ice Age" franchise. The film gave Lopez her highest opening weekend figure.

Messuri spent his first two seasons with the Johnstown Chiefs of the East Coast Hockey League, where he led the team in points in both the 1989-90 season (72 points) and the 1990-91 season (90 points). He also had a brief recall with the Chiefs' AHL affiliate, the Maine Mariners. Despite only playing two seasons and only 116 games with the Chiefs, Messuri's 162 points is the tenth-highest total in Chiefs' history.
Messuri later signed with the Flint Bulldogs of the Colonial Hockey League, where he played on a team with former teammates Quintin Brickley, Lee Odelein, E.J.

Asura cervicalis

Asura cervicalis is a species of moth of the Arctiidae family. It is known from the non-tropical parts of eastern Australia, including areas of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria.
The wingspan is about 15 mm. Adults are small, slim bodied and black with five yellow spots on each forewing. There is a large yellow patch on each hindwing.
The larvae have been observed on "Ficus", "Acacia" and "Eucalyptus" species, but is suspected of feeding only on the Lichens on the trunks and branches of these plants. They are small, reaching a length of about 15 mm when full-grown. They are black with yellow spots and sparse long grey hairs. There are four tufts of long dense black hair projecting from the verrucae on the meso- and meta-thorax on each side. Pupation takes place in a thin cocoon of felted hairs, attached to a wall or tree trunk.

2011 Indiana legislative walkouts

The 2011 Legislative Walkout in Indiana occurred during February and March when the Democratic minority, inspired by the 2011 Wisconsin protests, fled the state to deny the Indiana House of Representatives quorum needed to pass a controversial right-to-work bill, which would have removed the legal requirement that employees pay union dues. The walkout lasted nearly six weeks, and the majority responded by fining the missing members and withholding their pay. The walkout ended after the majority agreed to table three bills, including the one that sparked the walkout, from the agenda.
Walkout.
On February 22, 2011, Democratic legislators in the Indiana House of Representatives staged a legislative walkout. Republican legislators attempted to pass a right to work bill in the Indiana House of Representatives. The bill would have made it illegal for employees to be required to join a workers union. Republicans argued that it would help the state attract new employers. Unable to prevent the measure from passing, all but three Democratic legislators fled the state to neighboring Illinois to deny the body quorum while several hundred protesters staged demonstrations at the capital.
Minority walkouts are common in Indiana, but are typically short in duration. They have occurred as recently as 2005, and as long ago as Civil War era, when at the request of Governor Oliver P. Morton, Republicans fled the capitol to prevent anti-war and pro-Confederate legislation from passing. Republicans last staged a walkout in 2001 to deny quorum on statewide legislative redistricting, and Democrats did the same in 1991.
Governor Mitch Daniels stated that while he supported the legislation, he believed the Republican lawmakers should drop the bill because it was not part of their election platform and deserved a period of public debate. Republicans subsequently dropped the bill, but the Democratic lawmakers still refused to return to the capital, demanding additional bills be tabled, including a bill to create a statewide school voucher program. Their refusal to return left the Indiana General Assembly unable to pass any legislation.
Daniels was interviewed in February, 2011, about the similar 2011 Wisconsin budget protests in Madison. He declined to authorize the state police to compel the legislators to return. While supporting the Wisconsin Republicans, he stated that in Indiana "we're not in quite the same position or advocating quite the same things they are up in Madison."
The minority leader, Patrick Bauer, returned to the statehouse March 3 to negotiate the return of the minority members, detailing the list of bills they wanted removed from the agenda. House Speaker Brian Bosma rejected the request, and the House passed a resolution fining the missing members $250 daily until their return; this could exceed the representatives' entire annual salary if they remained away from the capital more than 90 days. On March 9, as it became apparent the Democrats would not return and because a state budget had not yet been approved, an angry Governor Daniels told the minority he would call a special session and keep the General Assembly in session until the end of the year—meaning Democrats could face fines of nearly $100,000 each. On March 13, Speaker Bosma continued negotiation with the minority leader by phone, saying he believed the standoff would soon come to an end.
In addition to the financial pressure on the minority, their walkout was also jeopardizing their chance to impact the statewide Congressional redistricting. If a redistricting plan is not approved by the end of the regular session on April 29, the duty falls to a five member commission made up of various predetermined elected officials—all of whom are Republican.
On March 28, Bosma and Bauer finally negotiated an end to the walkout. Bosma agreed that the majority would remove three bills of twelve bills the minority opposed, including the one that sparked the walkout, from the legislative calendar. The statewide school voucher bill was not removed. Bosma called the concession minor, while Bauer said the walkout achieved its aim of exposing the Republican agenda to the state. The walkout lasted nearly six weeks and the missing members were fined about $3500 each. Governor Daniels lamented the lost time in the legislative session, but was glad the minority finally returned.
Aftermath.
After the walkout, Republican legislators introduced a bill that would make legislative walkouts a criminal offense. A similar 1976 law had been ruled unconstitutional by the state courts previously.

Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 301

__NOTOC__
Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 301 was a scheduled flight from Honolulu, Hawaii to Nadi, Fiji. On 22 July 1962 it was being operated by a Bristol Britannia 314 four-engined turboprop airliner of Canadian Pacific Air Lines, registered "CF-CZB". On departure from Honolulu International Airport it had engine problems and returned to land on three engines when during an attempted go-around it crashed on the airfield, killing 27 of the 40 on board. 
Accident.
The Britannia "Empress of Lima" was on a scheduled flight from Honolulu Airport, Hawaii to Nadi Airport, Fiji. Shortly after take-off the crew had an engine fire warning, they feathered No. 1 engine and they jettisoned fuel before returning to Honolulu 40 minutes later. The three-engined approach appeared to be normal but at the last minute the crew decided to go-around and attempt another approach. The aircraft banked and veered to the left and the left wing tip hit the ground about 550 feet left from the center over the runway. The aircraft then disintegrated as it moved across the airfield before hitting some heavy earth-moving equipment. Apart from the rear fuselage and tail the aircraft was destroyed by fire, thirteen on board escaped but seven crew and 20 passengers were killed.
Aircraft.
The aircraft, a Bristol Britannia 314 four-engined turboprop airliner had been built in the United Kingdom and was first flown on the 14 April 1958. It was delivered new to Canadian Pacific Air Lines on 29 April 1958, originally named "Empress of Vancouver" it was later renamed "Empress of Lima".
Probable cause.
The accident investigation board concluded that the probable cause was "the attempted three-engine go-around, when the aircraft was in a full landing configuration, at insufficient airspeed and altitude to maintain control."

<doc id="31109766" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31109766" title="Child labour in Pakistan">
Child labour in Pakistan

Child labour in Pakistan is the employment of children for work in Pakistan, leading to mental, physical, moral and social harm to children.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan estimated in the 1990s that 11 million children were working in the country, half of those under the age of ten. In 1996, the median age for a child entering the work force was seven, down from eight years old 2 years prior. It was estimated that one quarter of the country’s work force was made up of child labourers. 
In a city of Pakistan, Hyderabad children enter work force at the of age 4 or 5 years and they make bangles and bracelets. They make around 12 sets (per set containing 65 bangles) and only gain Rs.40 from all the hard work.It depends on the time consumed in completing these sets it could take as long as 2 or 3 days and they would gain only Rs.40 in 2 or 3 days. This is not just a situation of Hyderabad but all other katchi abadis of Pakistan. 
Demographics.
As of 2012, it is estimated that 96 per cent of working boys were employed in the wholesale and retail industry in urban areas, followed by 22 per cent in the service industry and 22 per cent in manufacturing. As for the girls 48 per cent were employed in the service industry while 100 per cent were employed in manufacturing. In rural areas, 68 per cent of working boys were joined by 82 per cent of working girls. In the wholesale and retail industry the percentage of girl were 11 per cent followed by 11 per cent in manufacturing. 
Child labour in Pakistan is perhaps most rampant in city called Multan, which is an important production centre for exports goods such as sporting goods.
Causes.
International Labour Organisation (ILO) suggests poverty is the greatest single cause behind child labour. Pakistan has a per-capita income of approximately $1900. A middle class person in Pakistan earns around $5 a day on average.The average Pakistani has to feed nine or ten people with their daily wage. Further to that there is also the high inflation rate to contend with. As of 2008, 17.2% of the total population lives below the poverty line, which is the lowest figure in the history of Pakistan. Poverty levels in Pakistan appear to necessitate that children work in order to allow families to reach their target take‐home pay. On the side of the firms, the low cost of child labour gave manufacturers a significant advantage in the Western marketplace, where they undersell their competitors from countries prohibiting child labour, often by improbable amounts.
Government policies on child labour.
A number of laws contain provisions prohibiting child labour or regulating the working conditions of child and adolescent workers. The most important laws are:
The Factories Act 1934.
The West Pakistan Shops and Establishments Ordinance 1969.
The Employment of Children Act 1991
The Bonded Labour System Abolition Act 1992.
The Punjab Compulsory Education Act 1994
Child labour remains one of the major problems afflicting Pakistan and its children. Pakistan has passed laws in an attempt to limit child labour and indentured servitude—but those laws are universally ignored, and some 11 million children, aged four to fourteen, keep that country's factories operating, often working in brutal and squalid conditions.
Efforts to reduce child labour.
NGO groups against child labour have been raising awareness of the exploitation of children in Pakistan.
Football stitching.
By the late 1990s, Pakistan had come to account for 75 percent of total world production of footballs (or “soccer" balls in the US), and 71 percent of all soccer ball imports into the United States. The International Labour Rights Forum and allies called attention to rampant child labour in the soccer ball industry. According to investigations, thousands of children between the ages of 5 and 14 were putting in as many as 10 to 11 hours per day stitching.
Then, the International Labour Organization, UNICEF, Save the Children, and the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry signed the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Industry in Pakistan on February 14, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia.
Save the Children.
Save the children has also been working with some of the sporting goods manufacturers represented by the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) and their international partner brands, represented by the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI). This joint effort is aimed at ensuring that children are not employed to stitch footballs. Save the Children (UK) includes disseminating information about child labour on major networks like CBS and the like. 
Save the Children has also worked on project with the British Secretary of State for International Development to phase out child labour in Sialkot. The £750,000 donated by Britain will be spent on education and training, and also on setting up credit and savings schemes in an attempt to provide alternatives to bonded labour.
SPARC.
"SPARC" has conducted research that goes into producing its publications, including three major books on child labour, juvenile justice and child rights. Its annual report The State of Pakistan’s Children and a large number of brochures, SPARC has conducted a number of research studies. SPARC has continued to ask successive governments to upgrade their laws to set a legal age limit for employment in Pakistan, although they have not been successful in doing so.
Other NGOs.
Other NGOs that has worked on the issue of child labour in Pakistan includes organisation such as "UNICEF". "UNICEF" supported the NCCWD in drafting of the Child Protection Law and the Child Protection Policy and initiated the establishment of Child Protection Monitoring and Data Collecting System.Many other NGO such as "ROZAN" has work to protect the child in NGO. SPARC is a NGO.

Christ Church on Brixton Road in Lambeth SW9 is an Art Nouveau and Byzantine Revival Grade II* listed building built in 1902 by Arthur Beresford Pite for his brother-in-law, Rev William Mowll. The foundation stone, by Edward Johnston, was cut by Eric Gill in 1902. The church was consecrated by Edward Talbot, the Bishop of Rochester, on 5 December 1902. The outside pulpit in the south-west corner was designed by Weir, Burrows and Weir and was dedicated on 3 November 1907. 
The building has been substantially altered: the nave (which has been reduced in length) and sanctuary are probably the only two remaining areas close to the architect's original concept.
Former chapel.
The present church was built on the site of an earlier chapel,formerly the independent Holland Chapel, which was sold to Anglicans in 1835, enlarged and renamed "Christ Church" in 1855 and demolished in 1899.

Kuzuha, Hirakata, Osaka

Since 2004, Kuzuha has seen substantial redevelopment in the immediate station vicinity. This has been through investment by the Keihan company, and because of its prime location as a commuter town. The station itself is yet to receive any major redevelopment.
Buildings.
Kuzuha's most notable draw is its shopping mall, Kuzuha Mall. Originally built in 1972 in front of the station, it was a two-story open-air mall with a former JNR Class D51 steam locomotive at its centre. The mall was rebuilt in 2005, opening on April 14, 2005, and the locomotive was moved to Torokko Saga Station in Kyoto. The new Kuzuha Mall consists of multiple buildings, with a separate building for the Kuzuha Mall Kids and Uniqlo (and other stores above), along with the main three-story covered mall. Inside are modern shops, a department store, bakery, small art gallery and a two-storey cluster of restaurants in the 'Dining St.' food court.
Its most obvious landmark building is Kuzuha Tower City, built in 2004. Kuzuha Tower City consists of four residential towers, the tallest being 41 storeys and a height of 138.6 m. There is also a fourth four-storey fitness tower. At the time of its construction it was the highest known base isolation condominium in the world.
Kuzuha Public Golf Course.
Kuzuha Public Golf Course was established in 1957, and is an 18 hole par 70 course. Between 1965 and 1990 the golf course held over 26 international professional tournaments, and still holds regular national competitions.
Its close proximity to Yodo River has led to problems with flooding since 1963.
Local area.
Along the northern edge of Kuzuha is the bamboo forest of Mount Otokoyama in neighbouring Yawata, Kyoto. It was the bamboo from this forest that Thomas Edison (1847–1931) used as filament in his first electric light bulbs. There is a monument to Edison at the Iwashimizu Hachiman Shrine, also located on the mountain.
The Shinto shrine of Iwashimizu Hachiman-gū is notable in itself, being one of the three great Hachiman shrines of Japan. Founded in 859, the present main shrine was built in 1634, by the third shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu.

Being played on tennis courts of clay, the final was held in a heavy rain which turned the courts into mud. Since those games, the basketball games have been played indoors.

Anna MacGillivray Macleod

Anna MacGillivray Macleod (15 May 1917 – 13 August 2004) was a Scottish academic, a dedicated teacher and the first female Professor of Brewing and Biochemistry in the world at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh.
Family.
Born in Kirkhill, she was the daughter of the Rev. Alasdair MacGillivray Macleod and Margaret Ingram Sangster, M.A. Her heritage is from the Isle of Lewis, where her grandfather, Rev. George Macleod was the Minister of Garrabost and where her father was born. She was second cousin to the politician and former Chancellor of the Exchequer the Right Hon.Iain Norman Macleod. Her family belongs to the branch of Macleods of Pabbay and Uig.
As her father died at an early age, Anna was left to look after her widowed mother. Her two brothers were both Doctors of medicine - her elder brother was Dr. John George Macleod, who was the editor of Davidson's Textbook of Medicine and the author of Clinical Examination, and her younger brother was Dr. Alasdair MacGillivray Macleod, a general practitioner in Linlithgow.
Education & profession.
Anna Macleod was educated at Invergordon Academy and Edinburgh Ladies' College, and graduated from Edinburgh University with a BSc in Botany. She joined the faculty of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, in 1945, where she remained until her retirement in 1977. She returned in 1951 to Edinburgh University to study for a PhD . In the late 1960s she was awarded a Doctor of Science, also from Edinburgh University, for a thesis on the germination of barley.
In 1961 together with Leslie Samuel Cobley she co-edited Contemporary Botanical Thought, published by Oliver and Boyd. She edited the "Journal of the Institute of Brewing" from 1964 to 1976, and she was the first female President of the Institute of Brewing from 1970 to 1972. In 1975 she was appointed Professor of Brewing at Heriot-Watt University. In 1976 one of the greatest honours in the Brewing industry was bestowed on her - the Horace Brown medal. She retired in 1977, but continued as professor emeritus. In 1993, Heriot-Watt University awarded her an honorary Doctorate of Science for her discovery of Gibberellic Acid, which was an advantage for the Maltsters as it shortened the malting process. At that occasion, the Dean of the Faculty of Science, Professor Philip G. Harper, mentioned that Anna Macleod’s association with the brewing industry puts her in the same fraternity as other scientists, such as James Watt (power), Louis Pasteur (Pasteurisation), Peter Greiss (colour chemistry), Lovibond (colour physics), Grosser (statistics) and the Royal Society medallist, Horace Brown, the distinguished biologist and brewer. He said that she was recognised nationally and internationally with distinction as a university teacher, scholar, scientist, technologist and as a brewer.
One of her PhD. students, Geoff Palmer, first worked with her especially on the research of Barley and they published numerous papers together. He then became her successor at the Heriot-Watt.
Anna Macleod died at St.Raphaels, Edinburgh on 13 August 2004.
Heriot-Watt University's Brewing and Distilling department, as it is now called, started the Anna Macleod Scholarship with a financial gift she had bequeathed to that University in her will.

The Breckland Beira is a sports car launched in June 2008 at the London Motorexpo, developed by the British company Breckland Technologies based in Dereham, Norfolk. Breckland Technologies was founded in 2000 specialising in manufacturing low volume specialist sports cars such as the Leading Edge 240 RT and Mosler MT900. The company became insolvent soon after the announcement of the new Beira, and was dissolved in July 2009.
Beira V8.
Based on the GM Kappa platform, the Breckland Biera was closely related to the Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky and Opel GT. Featuring the 6.0 L V8 LS2 engine from General Motors producing around 400 bhp, and mated to a Tremec six-speed manual gearbox, the Beira was developed to work with LPG to give it a dual fuel range of around 700 miles. Around 25 cm was added to the length of the car to accommodate a 70-litre LPG tank alongside the regular petrol tank.
Official performance figures were not formally issued, the 1400 kg car was expected to accelerate 0-62 mph in under 5 seconds.
It was anticipated that the first cars would be on sale from November 2008 at around £55,000 but only in left hand drive. According to Breckland Technologies director Mike Rawlings, ‘the Beira carries on from where Marcos and TVR left off’. 
Beyond the initial launch cars, production never started though a facelift version was photographed by a German car magazine in November 2008. The company folded in July 2009 without any known deliveries.

Symphony in C (orchestra)

Symphony in C (Orchestra), formerly known as the Haddonfield Symphony, is a professional training orchestra based in Camden, New Jersey. Founded in 1952, Symphony in C's mission to train young professionals is similar to that of the Chicago Civic Orchestra and Miami's New World Symphony. The orchestra's home is The Gordon Theater on the campus of Rutgers–Camden University, and its current music director is Rossen Milanov.
History.
The Haddonfield Symphony began as an amateur, volunteer ensemble for music lovers in 1952. The orchestra's debut performance was in January 1954 under music director Guido Terranova, and for decades brought classical music to its local communities. During the 1987–1988 season, the orchestra established a Professional Development Internship program and began providing training and performance opportunities to young professional musicians. The shift from an amateur to a semiprofessional ensemble caused controversy about the symphony’s mission and in May 1991, the majority of amateur volunteers refused to put on a scheduled show, quit the Haddonfield Symphony and formed the Philharmonic of Southern New Jersey. Instead of recruiting new volunteers, the orchestra altered its mission and evolved into what it is today - a professional-caliber orchestra accountable for training some of the country's top music directors and musicians. The orchestra is made up of current and graduate students from the most reputable music schools in the country, including Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music and New York City's Juilliard School of Music. Many Symphony in C alumni now perform with the best orchestras in the world.
For years, the orchestra had no performance venue of its own, and traveled the region performing at high school auditoriums or whatever venues happened to be available. As part of a strategic plan, in the 2006–2007 season, the symphony began a new era and it moved its entire concert series to the Gordon Theater on the Rutgers–Camden University campus, in Camden, New Jersey. The orchestra’s successful first performances in Camden ended their nomadic ways, and they settled into a permanent home there. This also led to the orchestra’s name change from The Haddonfield Symphony to Symphony in C – the ‘C’ in its name representing its continued mission and new home: City, Culture, Community and Camden. In 2013, the Symphony's administrative and box offices moved to Collingswood.
Young Composers Competition.
Established in 1996, Symphony in C’s annual Young Composers Competition is open to composers under the age of 30 and has a growing reputation at music conservatories across the country. Each year’s winning work is performed on one of the season’s subscription concerts.
Notable Alumni.
Symphony in C alumni hold, or have held positions with major orchestras in the United States and all over the world including: Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Montreal Symphony Orchestra, National Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, and Seattle Symphony.

General Governorate of Belgium

The Imperial German General Governorate of Belgium () was a German military government established in occupied Belgium during the First World War.
Government and administration.
The governorate was set up on 26 August 1914, when Field Marshal Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz was appointed the military governor of Belgium. He was succeeded by General Moritz von Bissing on 27 November 1914.
Soon after Bissing's appointment, the German High Command divided Belgium into three zones. The largest of the zones was the General Governorate, which included the capital Brussels and the surrounding countryside. The second zone, under the control of the German Fourth Army, included the cities of Ghent and Antwerp. The third zone, under the auspices of the German Navy, included all Belgian coastal zones under German occupation.
The German occupation tried to keep the pre-war Belgian administrative system as intact as possible and guide it using a small group of German officers and officials with adequate lingual and administrative skills.
The occupation tested to destruction what few constraints international law imposed on an occupying power. A heavy-handed German military administration sought to regulate every detail of daily life, both on a personal level with travel restraints and collective punishment as on the economical level by harnessing the Belgian industry to the German advantage and by levying repetitive massive indemnities on the Belgian provinces. Among the measures of the German governorate was to shift Belgium from Greenwich Mean Time to Central European Time. Before the War Belgium was the sixth largest economy in the world but the Germans destroyed the Belgian economy thoroughly by dismantling industries and transporting the equipment and machinery to Germany that it never regained its pre-war level. More than 100,000 Belgian workers were forcibly deported to Germany to work in the war industry and to Northern France to build roads and other military facilities to the German military's benefit.
The German High Command hoped to exploit the ethnic tension between the Flemish and Walloons, and envisioned a post-war German protectorate in Flanders, while Wallonia was to be used for industrial materials and labour along with much of northeastern France.
In April 1917 Von Bissing died and he was succeeded by Ludwig von Falkenhausen.

List of state librarians of Ohio

The State Library of Ohio was created in 1817 as a service to the government of the state. Over the years, the State Library has increased its scope to include service to all residents of the state. The position of State Librarian of Ohio was created with the creation of the first State Library of Ohio in 1821. In the early days of the state library, the position was a political 'reward' given by the Governor or legislature. An illustration of that is the fact that the position of changed twice between two men from 1896 to 1921. During the administration of a Democratic Governor, John Newman held the position. Then, when a Republican Governor was elected Charles Galbreath held the job. The first professional librarian was not appointed until 1921. Today, the post is held by a trained librarian who is responsible for the overall management of the State Library.
The first State Librarian was John Harper, appointed by Governor Worthington. The governor had purchased 509 books to be used as a resource for the Ohio State Legislature. Mr. Harper was paid $2.00 per day for each day the legislature was in session. The second librarian was appointed by a senator in 1820. In 1823 the Ohio legislature passed a law defining the term of state librarian as three years with an annual salary of $200.
An outcome of the Ohio Constitutional Convention of 1851 was that the appointment of state librarian was returned to the Governor, though appointment was subject to consent of the Ohio State Senate. The salary was increased to $10,000 and length of term changed to 2 years. A Board of Library Commissioners, consisting of the Governor, Secretary of State, and the State Librarian, was created by the Ohio General Assembly in 1858.
In 1921 the State Library became a division of the Department of Education with a five-member board overseeing policies of the library and the appointment of the State Librarian. Four members of the board were appointed by the Governor and the Director of Education would be the fifth member. The State Librarian was the board's secretary.

<doc id="31110225" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31110225" title="Bonoman">
Bonoman

Bonoman (Bono State) was a trading state created by the Abron people. Bonoman was a medieval Akan kingdom in what is now the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana and eastern Ivory Coast. It is generally accepted as the origin of the subgroups of the Akan people who migrated out of the state at various times to create new Akan states in search of gold. The gold trade, which started to boom in Bonoman as early in the 12th century, was the genesis of Akan power and wealth in the region, beginning in the Middle Ages.
Origin.
The origin of the people of Bonoman was said to be further north in what is now called the Sahel or the then Ghana Empire when natives wanted to remain with their traditional form of Ancestral worship and spirituality, those that disagreed with Islam, migrated south.
Trading centres used by state.
Bono Manso.
Bono Manso (sometimes known as Bono Mansu) was a trading area in the ancient state of Bonoman, and a major trading center in what is now predominantly the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. Located just south of the Black Volta river at the transitional zone between savanna and forest, the town was frequented by caravans from Djenné as part of the Trans-Saharan trade. Goods traded included kola nuts, salt, leather and gold; gold was the most important trading good of the area, starting in the mid-14th century.
Begho.
Begho (also "Bighu" or "Bitu"; called "Bew" and "Nsokɔ" by the Akan) was an ancient trading town located just south of the Black Volta at the transitional zone between the forest and savanna (present-day Ghana, north-western Brong-Ahafo Region). The town, like Bono-Manso, was of considerable importance as an entrepot frequented by northern caravans from Mali from around 1100 AD. Goods traded included ivory, salt, leather, gold, kola nuts, cloth, and copper alloys.
Excavations have laid bare walled structures dated between 1350 and 1750 AD, as well as pottery of all kinds, smoking pipes, and evidence of iron smelting. With a probable population of over 10 000, Begho was one of the largest towns in the southern part of West Africa at the time of the arrival of the Portuguese in 1471.
Bondukru.
Bonduku was another trading center within the empire of Bonoman. It gave birth to the state of Gyaman also spelled Jamang Kingdom. The state existed from 1450 to 1895 and was located in what is now Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire.
Structure of towns of Bonoman.
Based on excavations, carbon datings and local oral traditions, Effah-Gyamfi (1985) postulated three distinct urban phases. According to him, in the early phase (thirteenth to fifteenth century) the urban center was relatively small, and the towns were populated by thousands of people, not all living in the urban center. Buildings were made of daubted wattle. Painted pottery of this period was found distributed within a radius of 3.3 km.
In the second phase, sixteenth to seventeenth century, the urban centers were larger, consisting mainly of evenly distributed houses and a nuclear market center. Many indications of participation in long-distance trade, such as imported glass beads and mica coated pottery, stem from this period.
Influence on Akan culture.
Various aspects of Akan culture stem from Bonoman, including: the umbrella used for the kings, the swords of the nation, the stools, goldsmithing, blacksmithing, Kente Cloth weaving and goldweighing.
Fall of Bonoman.
The fall of the various Abron states occurred during the rise of more powerful Akan nations, especially the dominant Ashanti empire. Several factors weakened these states, including conflicts among the leadership, conflicts due to taxation, and no direct access to the coast, where trade was helping many Akan states have more influence. By the late 19th century, all of Bonoman became part of the Asante Empire.

Anton Docher

Anton Docher (1852-1928) was a French Franciscan Roman Catholic priest, missionary and defender of the Indians. He was born in 1852 in Le Crest, a small wine growing village of Puy de Dôme in Auvergne. He lived in the pueblo of Isleta in the state of New Mexico for 34 years. His French name was Antonin Jean Baptiste Docher (pronounced ), but his American first name became Anton, and in the American literature he was sometimes called Antonin, Antonio, Anthony, Antoine, Antonine or Antonino.
Biography.
During his youth, Father Docher worked in the vineyards with his three brothers and his widowed mother. At the age of 18, he became a student at the "Petit" Seminary of Saint Sauveur in Puy de Dôme, staying there for eight years. At the age of 27, during his first year studying Philosophy in the "Grand" Seminary of Clermont-Ferrand, he was conscripted for military service and was sent to Africa then to Cochinchina where he fought for five years in the colonial army, achieving the rank of sergeant. Docher was wounded and decorated for bravery, but his experiences led him to recognise the immorality of colonialism, which he later compared to the fate suffered by Native Americans. Having contracted lung disease whilst in Africa he returned to the "Petit" Seminary as a Prefect.
On October 21, 1887, he went to New Mexico where, after two years of additional studies, he was ordained as a priest in the Cathedral of Santa Fe by J.B.Salpointe. He then served two more years in Bernalillo and in Taos, before arriving in Isleta on December 28, 1891. The Indian village of Isleta is situated on the left bank of the Rio Grande, south of Albuquerque, being populated by Tiwa Indians of the Pueblo people. During his period in Isleta he also served as a priest in Laguna, Acoma, Los Lunas, and Peralta.
In Los Lentes, in 1893, he acquired a massive ancient bell for the chapel which he put in a prominent central belfry.
"The Padre of Isleta" spent 34 years with the Indians. He was a very close friend of Adolph Bandelier, Charles Fletcher Lummis and Pablo Abeita. Like his friend Bandelier he collected Indian objects during this period (kachinas, pottery, basketry and weapons), some of which have been preserved by the Docher and Morvan families. Respected by the Natives Americans for his open-minded attitude to their customs and ancestral faiths (quite normal with friends such as Lummis and Bandelier), he was called "Tashide" which means "little helper" in Tewa language. He was also well known to have owned a parrot named Tina which used very foul language, and a beautiful and luxuriant garden.
During his long stay to Isleta, he met celebrities of this time like the royal family of Belgium, Willa Cather and George Wharton James among others.
Father Docher raised an Isletan orphan boy named Tomas Chavez and when as a man Tomas took a wife, named Lolita Delores, Father Docher gave the couple five acres and a house in Los Lunas as a wedding gift. Tomas developed a vineyard on this land and supplied wine to the Isleta and local churches. Tomas died in 1925, three years before the Father himself. Lolita Delores was left with nine children, and Father Docher paid for two girls, Stella and Margaret, to attend the Sisters of Loretto Orphanage.
Very proud to have been granted American citizenship, Docher described himself as an "Indian" in the letters which he sent to his family.
In September 1912, he presided over the funeral mass of Solomon Luna, powerful businessman and politician of New Mexico, found mysteriously dead in his ranch on August 30, 1912. The mass took place at the Immaculate Conception church of Albuquerque because the parish church Los Lunas was far too small to accommodate the large crowd in attendance.
On October 26, 1919, he was decorated with the Belgium Order of Leopold by King Albert I, who visited the village of Isleta with his Queen Elisabeth and Prince Leopold. In return Father Docher presented the King with a beautiful turquoise cross mounted in silver, and a silver sword made by the Indians. 10 000 persons journeyed to Isleta for the occasion.
In 1923, Father Anton Docher undertook a major remodeling of the San Agustín de la Isleta Mission (previously named San Antonio de Isleta), constructing prominent spires on the adobe walls. He also constructed a sloping roof in order to avoid the water leaks which destroyed the altar constantly. The mission has now been restored to a more "traditional" frame.
Father Docher spent the last three years of his life as a patient at the St Joseph Hospital (Albuquerque) and died at the age of 76 on December 18, 1928. Albert Daeger, archbishop of Santa Fe, presided the mass of funeral in the church of Isleta(see photo below). Father Docher is now buried by the side of Father Juan de Padilla in Isleta.
Literature.
His adventurous life was told in a novel of Samuel Gance, "Anton ou la trajectoire d'un père". The book depicts its childhood in Auvergne, its military period in Tunisia and in Indochina, its departure for New Mexico, its meetings with Charles Lummis, Adolph Bandelier, Pablo Abeita, Willa Cather and the king of the Belgians. The narrative lingers especially over its paternal relation with Tomas Chavez, a young orphan Indian.
A part of his biography was the subject of a book, "The Padre of Isleta" by Julia Keleher and Elsie Ruth Chant, first published in 1940 and then in 2009 (Sunstone Press).
In Willa Cather's novel "Death Comes for the Archbishop", he served as a model for the character of Padre Jesus de Baca. Willa Cather met Father Anton Docher during a visit in Isleta while he was suffering from cataract and near the end of his life. She noted that he lived very poorly and was beloved and respected by "his" Indians, she noted that emanated from his person a great kindness and great humanity. In the novel, the Father de Baca is described "simple like a child and superstitious", while the Padre Docher was often described as droll, intelligent and cultivated.
Father Docher wrote an interesting ethnological article published in "The Santa Fé Magazine" on June,1913, in which he describes the early 20th century's life in the Pueblos, and notably the special Administration of the Pueblo, fully recognized by the United States Government, with a Cacique appointed for life, a Governor (judge in civil cases) elected yearly by the people with two assistants and a War Captain and other officials who have charge of the various celebrations and dances.
History and legends.
The life of Docher was also tightly bound to the legends of Isleta, in particular the legend of Padre Juan de Padilla the body of which was considered for getting up of its grave and for roaming in the village some evenings. One day (April 25, 1895), Antonin Docher decided, to investigate this ghost's appearance in the presence of other witnesses and opened the grave of Padre Padilla. During this operation Anton Docher injured his arm and the gangrene settled down so much that the doctors recommended amputation. The natives inhabitants evoked the malediction of Padre Padilla. Antonin Docher made a prayer to Padre Padilla to cure him, and the wound disappeared.

Judy's Book

Judy's Book is a social search tool and online yellow pages used by millions of registered users across the United States to find the best deals, discounts and coupons and to locate local businesses and professionals such as physicians, restaurants, dentists, dry cleaners, pizza restaurants and plumbers, and rate and review them.
__TOC__
History.
In 2004, friends and entrepreneurs Andy Sack (Founders Co-op, Kefta, Abuzz, Firefly Network) and Chris DeVore (Founders Co-op, Sapient Corporation, Adjacency) founded Judy's Book with a $2.5 million seed funding that they were able to raise. The social networking-based local search tool allows small businesses to promote themselves and users to browse through listings to locate businesses and professionals in their area and rate and review their experiences. According to the official website, the idea of Judy's Book was inspired by co-founder Andy Sack's mother-in-law, Judy Albert, who kept a "little green book" full of lists and shopping tips and other favorites that she'd share with family and friends to help them find "the best of everything".
Seth Godin described the start up as "Craig's List meets Zagats meets Orkut." The website allows small, mid and even large sized businesses to submit all promotions and deals they have so that users can then easily navigate through them and keep up with the latest offerings. Registered users can browse through local and online stores and even post deals, coupons or any other sales they learn of and further enhance existing postings by providing more detailed information and adding personal reviews, ratings and tags.
Marketing tactics.
In 2005, in an effort to get the website off the ground, the company offered iPods to anyone who submitted 50 reviews of local businesses. While the then-owners and founders of Judy's Book, Andy and Chris, refused to reveal how many people won iPods or how many reviews were submitted, Sack announced that their marketing efforts were successful as the website saw a 50-60% increase in reviews and member registrations every month.
In 2006, the website gave out $100 gift certificates every day from February 16 until March 5 to the person who had written the most reviews that day.
Also in 2006, in an attempt to further increase traffic to the website, Judy's Book announced that it was partnering with Local.com. All reviews written on Judy's Book were included in Local.com's search results.
In 2006, Judy's Book claimed trademark on the term social search.
Deadpooled.
After burning through $10.5 million in capital that was raised over the three years of its operation, and unable to generate enough revenue to keep the website afloat, the company began looking for a new buyer. Judy's Book was deadpooled in October 2007.
Change of ownership and management.
In October 2008, nearly one year from the day Judy's Book laid off nearly all of its staff and was declared "deadpooled", Seattle-based angel investors Geoff Entress (Madrona Venture Group), David Niu (founder of BuddyTV) and Andy Liu (CEO of BuddyTV) bought the company from the original founders, Andy and Chris. The group are currently working together on another venture capital, Founders Co-op. However, in an interview with one of the owners, Andy Liu noted that the purchase of Judy's Book took place before they invested in the Internet incubator, Founders Co-op. While none of the investors were willing to reveal how much was paid in its acquisition, it is assumed to be far less than the $10.5 million the original founders had put in the start-up. The website is currently led by General Manager, Ali Alami.
In June of 2012, the new management of Judy's Book launched KidScore which is an at of glance measure of a places kid friendliness.

Detlef Irrgang

Detlef Irrgang (born 27 May 1966) is a German former footballer who played as an attacking midfielder. He is best remembered for his two spells with Energie Cottbus, spanning 22 years, over 400 appearances, and the reunification of Germany.
Career.
Born in Finsterwalde, Irrgang began his footballing career with Motor Finsterwalde Süd, before joining Cottbus at age 11. He progressed to the first-team, and played for the club in the late-1980s as they yo-yoed between the DDR-Oberliga and the second tier DDR-Liga. After reunification, Energie failed to qualify for the 2. Bundesliga, so Irrgang joined a club who had: he spent the 1991–92 season with Stahl Brandeburg, but returned to Cottbus a year later, after 16 appearances and two goals.
Cottbus were one of the stronger sides in the NOFV-Oberliga Mitte, but could not overtake perennial champions Union Berlin, who were themselves unable to earn promotion. However, Energie's second-place finish in 1994 was enough to qualify for the newly formed Regionalliga Nordost. Irrgang scored 22 goals in his second season at this level, making him the League's top scorer, and better was to come the following year. Cottbus ended the 1996–97 season as league champions, and defeated Hannover 96 in a playoff to earn promotion to the 2. Bundesliga, with Irrgang scoring two goals in the tie. The club had also reached the final of the 1996–97 DFB-Pokal, eventually losing against VfB Stuttgart.
Irrgang continued to be a key player for Cottbus in the second tier, making 84 appearances in three seasons, and scoring 13 goals. He scored the winning goal in his last game for the club, a 1–0 win over 1. FC Köln which secured a remarkable promotion to the Bundesliga. He retired with Energie's all-time appearance record (which he still holds), and the nickname "Fußballgott" (Football God) from the club's fans.
After retirement, Irrgang continued with Energie in a marketing capacity. He was appointed as the club's general manager during the 2007–08 season, but left the club at the end of the season after a dispute, the details of which are still unknown. He also served as a councillor in Cottbus from 2003 to 2008, as part of the CDU.

Ahmet Ali Çelikten, also known as Arap Ahmet Ali or İzmirli Ahmet Ali (born İzmirli Alioğlu Ahmed; 1883–1969), was an Ottoman aviator who may have been the first black military pilot in aviation history and was one of only two black pilots in World War I (the other being Eugene Jacques Bullard). His grandmother came from Bornu (now in Nigeria) to the Ottoman Empire as a slave.
Biography.
Ahmet born in 1883 in İzmir, in the Aidin Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire to his mother Zenciye Emine Hanım and father Ali Bey, of African Turkish descent. He aimed to become a naval sailor and entered the Naval Technical School named "Haddehâne Mektebi" (literally "School of the Blooming Mill") in 1904. In 1908, he graduated from school as a First Lieutenant ("Mülâzım-ı evvel"). And then he went to aviation courses in the Naval Flight School ("Deniz Tayyare Mektebi") that was formed on 25 June 1914 at Yeşilköy. He was then a member of the Ottoman Air Force.
During World War I, he married Hatice Hanım (1897–1991) who was an immigrant from Preveza. He became first black military pilot in aviation history when he started serving in November 1916. On 18 December 1917, Captain ("Yüzbaşı") Ahmed Ali was sent to Berlin to complete aviation courses.
He died in 1969.
Legacy.
To quote David Nicolle's book, "The Ottoman Army 1914–1918", "Most Ottoman aircrew were recruited from the Turkish heartland ... others came from the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire as far south as Yemen, or even from neutral Iran. Captain Ahmet was of Arab-African origin and may have been the first 'black' Air Force pilot in aviation history, having received his 'wings' in 1914-15." The book features a photo of Ahmet in front of a Bleriot XI-2 trainer at the Yesilkoy flying school. We featured the same photo in "Over the Front", Volume 9, No. 3, Fall 1994. Ahmet's "wings" would seem to have been earned prior to Bullard's earning his brevet No. 6259 on 20 July 1917, though Bullard is often cited as history's first black aviator.

List of female viceroys in Canada

A total of twenty women have served, or are currently serving, as a viceroy in Canada An additional seven women have performed vice-regal functions as Territorial Commissioners. 
Canada is a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Canada. She is the country's head of state. As the Queen does not always reside in Canada, her daily responsibilities in the country are undertaken at the national level by the Governor General of Canada and at the provincial level in each of the ten provinces by a Lieutenant Governor. Collectively, these individuals are the Queen's official vice-regal representatives.
Governors General.
A total of three women have served as the Governor General of Canada, the Queen's vice-regal representative at the national level in the country. 
Provincial Lieutenant Governors.
In each of the ten provinces of Canada, a lieutenant governor acts as the Queen's viceregal representative. A total of fifteen women have served, or are currently serving, as the lieutenant governor of a province. The lieutenant governors of the provinces are appointed by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada. As of 2013, all of the provinces except Newfoundland and Labrador have had at least one woman serve as lieutenant governor. There are two female provincial viceroys serving at present, with a third slated to take office in 2014.
Territorial Commissioners.
In each of the three territories of Canada, a Commissioner is the formal head of state. Unlike the Governor General or a Lieutenant Governor, who are officially representatives of the Queen of Canada, the commissioners are appointed by the Government of Canada and therefore, they are not technically viceregal representatives. However, they too perform duties akin to a viceroy including reading the Speech from the Throne at the opening of the territorial Legislature. Under the federal statutes governing the territories, the Commissioners act in accordance with written instructions from the Canadian federal cabinet or the minister responsible (currently the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development). While commissioners used to have a direct day-to-day role in administration and government and chaired the Executive Council of the territory, today they are under instruction to act more like provincial Lieutenant-Governors, as territorial assemblies have taken on more responsibility.
A total of seven women have served, or are currently serving, as a Commissioner in the territories of Canada; one woman has served terms as a commissioner in two territories.

Embassy of Greece, Washington, D.C.

The Embassy of Greece in Washington, D.C. is the Hellenic Republic's diplomatic mission to the United States. It is located at 2221 Massachusetts Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D.C. in the Embassy Row neighborhood, near Sheridan Circle. The Embassy complex consists of four buildings. The current ambassador is Vasilis Kaskarelis who is in office since 2009.
History.
After the War of Independence, which started in 1821, Greece was declared an independent state but it was not until 3 February 1830 that the Independence was recognised by the Great Powers with the signing of the Protocol of London. In 7 May 1832 Otto of Greece arrived in Nafplion and Greece became a Kingdom. The United States, however, recognized the Greek state only in 1833. In December 1837 a commercial treaty was signed, which regulated trade between the two countries. The first Greek consulate to be established was that of New Orleans, in 1866. Records indicate that Nicolas Benachi was the first Greek consul in New Orleans. In 1867, Demetrios Nicholas Botassis was named Consul General of Greece in New York City.
Consulates.
The Embassy is also responsible for other eight Greek diplomatic missions (six consulates-general and two consulates) throughout the United States, each one responsible for certain states:

John Howell Memorial Park

John Howell Memorial Park is a 2.8 acre park in the Virginia Highland neighborhood of Atlanta.
History.
The park is built on the site of 11 houses demolished in the mid-1960s, when the Georgia Department of Transportation proposed building Interstate 485 to connect what is now Freedom Parkway through Virginia Highland to what is now Georgia 400 at Interstate 85. The park site would have been the Virginia Avenue exit off the freeway.
I-485 was finally defeated, and The Georgia Department of Transportation began selling the properties it had acquired. In 1988, the park opened.
In the early 1980s, the Virginia Highland Civic Fund, Inc. was created to plan and develop the space. The park design emerged from a study broadly distributed broadly across the neighborhood. In the late 1980s, the Living AIDS Memorial Park Project and Volleyball Atlanta joined the effort and provided fundraising and technical help.
In 1989, the park was named after Virginia Highland resident and anti-freeway activist John Howell, who died from complications of HIV in 1988. 
Peter Frawley & Associates, a local landscape architectural firm, coordinated all the input. In February, 1993, the city council approved the final plan for the park. The decade long fund raising and construction project was headed by Park Project President Jerry Bright and project manager Rick Porter. John Howell Park Project Corporate minutes 1985 - 2000 and other historical documents are available at Emory Universary Atlanta, Georgia USA
Features.
Features of the park, from west to east, are:
Along Virginia Avenue are eleven granite columns, each of which bears the address of one of the homes that were demolished.

An essay on the classification of the parasitic Hymenoptera of Britain which correspond with the Ichneumones minuti of Linnaeus

An essay on the classification of the parasitic Hymenoptera of Britain which correspond with the Ichneumones minuti of Linnaeus is a Victorian monograph of entomology published in the "Entomological Magazine" between 1833 and 1838, by the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday.
The "Ichneumones minuti" of Linnaeus broadly correspond to the Braconidae and (superfamily Chalcidoidea).'Haliday establishes higher level taxa (Families and describes new genera and species. The synoptic tables and descriptions are in Latin. Characters used are (mainly) morphology of the abdomen and thorax, wing venation, number of antennal segments and number of maxillary palpi segments.
The Essay begins with I "Tabula synoptica generum et subgenerum ichneumonum adscitorum Britanniae Synoptic Table of Genera and Subgenera of Ichneumons Found in Britain" (Braconidae). This functions as a dichotomous key.
Part II is "Excerptae Quedam e Methodo Chalidum " Parts of a method and groups of chalcids
The collections (other than his own) consulted were those of John Curtis and Mus. Soc. Ent. (Museum of the Entomological Society)
Works consulted ("Auctores laudati") were 
"Of the Ichneumones of the Second Line, (Ichneumones adsciti, Essenbeck)
"The authors who have treated of the family at large are enumerated and noticed in detail by Professor Gravenhorst, in the Prolegomena to his History of European Ichneumones. It was not till the year 1811 that this supplemental branch was distinguished from the proper Ichneumones, by Doctor Nees von Essenbeck, whose system is more fully unfolded in the ninth volume of the New Series of Transactions, published by the Imperial Academy of the Physical Sciences, and has been followed by modern entomologists with few exceptions . That of Spinola, which Latreille adopted, and has adhered to in his latest works, differs in result as detailed by them from that first mentioned, only as respects the genus Agathis, whose affinity to Bracones is admitted by Latreille himself. But, accurately examined, this method will be found to fail, as the variations of the palpi (on which it is founded) are much more extensive than those it comprehends. That of Von Essenbeck is therefore as superior in certainty as it is in facility of application; while the few Apterous species are, by habit, easily assigned to their proper station in the family. He has, however, employed the principle of Spinola for the distinctive characters of his secondary groups, the Bracones and Bassi, a division which is accordingly defective in a similar degree. The difficulty of applying such a test appears from the fact that this most accurate observer has made glaring transpositions (I am acquainted with but two Aphidius ephippium and Alysia aptera) even among the genera strictly reducible to the lines of his own method. Professor Fallen, in a recent Essay, while he adopts the primary division of Von Essenbeck, has rejected these minor groups; but in reducing the number and extending the limits of the genera, has produced an arrangement which seems less simple and natural. Of the genera, seven had been previously established (but not all equally well defined) by Fabricius,Latreille, Schrank and Jurine; the rest we owe to the labours of the same accomplished naturalist, who has besides described at length a considerable number of the European species; of which, also, several will be found dispersed among the Fabrician genera, and more collected and arranged in the Ligurian Fauna of Spinola. Seven species only are noticed by Linne; two of which are placed among his Ichneumones majores, four with the minuti, and one is appended to thegenus Cynips. The little that is known of their instincts and economy is to be found in the pages of Reamur, and of the incomparable Swede, in patient observation almost his equal, and his systematic views (may I not say) unrivalled among his contemporaries. A few of the more familiar species have also been figured, and their habits noticed, by some of the older writers upon insects, as Madame Merian, Frisch etc.; and some interesting contributions to their history, in recent publications, are to be consulted under their respective heads"."

Steven Baillie

Steven Baillie is an art director and photographer.
Early life and influences.
The son of Scottish immigrants who settled in the U.S. in the 1960s, Steven Baillie is the youngest of four brothers raised in Long Branch, New Jersey. Throughout their childhood, the children accompanied their parents on return visits to Scotland, where Steven discovered "i-D magazine," and soon began going to great lengths to collect it and similar publications like "The Face" and "Blitz."
In 1985, Baillie formed the alternative goth band, Screaming for Emily, with a group of his childhood friends. Playing in Asbury Park, N.J., and in New York City clubs like the famed Danceteria, Baillie’s U.K. influences carried over into his music. Music magazine "Propaganda" declared, “The home-grown act that emerged looked and sounded like they had just been flown in from central London.” The band reunited more than a decade later for a tour and album release.
Education and early career.
Baillie attended art school in Philadelphia, and earned his Associate’s Degree in Visual Communications. He worked his way through college assisting photographers both locally and in New York City.
After graduating, he took a job at the advertising agency GYRO, which later became Quaker City Mercantile. “While I was there,” says Baillie, “we managed to make a lot of noise.” The small agency was written up in the "New York Times," among other publications, because of its innovative approach and results. At an early age, Baillie became GYRO’s main art director. They landed MTV as an account while he was there, and eventually, Baillie went to work for MTV directly.
As an Art Director in MTV’s in-house advertising department, Baillie worked under MTV creative director Jeffrey Keyton. He remained there for a number of years, winning awards both from the Art Directors Club and Type Directors Club of New York.
London and publishing.
Baillie then got the opportunity to work on the new, bi-annual offshoot of the men’s magazine, "Arena": it was "Arena Homme Plus." After two years there, Baillie became "Homme Plus"’s art director, and worked with editor Ashley Heath, and stylists David Bradshaw and Karl Templer, who remain two of the major players in global fashion today.
During his time at "Arena Homme Plus," Baillie worked with some of the biggest names in photography, including Nick Knight, Juergen Teller, Mario Testino, Steven Klein, and David Sims. Designer Peter Saville, one of Baillie’s adolescent idols, was also a contributor to the magazine. “This was a dream come true for me, considering I grew up not far from where the "Jersey Shore" is filmed,” Baillie says. “I was the only American who ever worked there, in the beginning—most the people who weren’t British in this scene were European.”
The publishing company at the time, Wagadon, was something of a pop culture mecca: They published "Arena, Arena Homme Plus, The Face", and later, "Pop" magazine. As well as creating all of the typefaces used in "Arena Homme Plus," Baillie also made contributions to "The Face," including a typeface called Ruscha that the publication employed for a number of years.
New York and advertising.
As "Arena Homme Plus" gained prominence and influence, Baillie was hired back to New York to work for the "New York Times"’s "The Fashion of the Times" (later "T" magazine), and Fabien Baron took over AD duties at "Homme Plus" (later succeeded by Doug Lloyd, M/M Paris, and Neville Brody). For three years, Baillie collaborated with Amy Spindler as Art Director of the fashion, home and lifestyle titles—while still maintaining ties to "Arena."
While working for the "New York Times," Baillie began making the transition back to advertising by freelancing at various agencies, and was soon working on global campaigns.
Photography.
After returning to the U.K. for a year to work at British "GQ," Baillie turned to professional photography. By integrating photography into his freelance repertoire, Baillie became something of a one-stop shop. He helped take the Original Penguin brand global from its relaunch. He also consulted with Marc Ecko’s "Complex" magazine during this period, shooting a majority of its covers, and also landed some campaigns. Baillie maintained his ties with the publishing world, also working for American "GQ" and a few other European publications.
Recent work.
Baillie went on to serve as Art Director for Target during a period that many consider a rebirth of the brand. He also rebranded Gap for Laird + Partners in 2009 and 2010.

<doc id="31110605" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31110605" title="Sigeion">
Sigeion

Sigeion (Ancient Greek: , "Sigeion"; Latin: "Sigeum") was an ancient Greek city in the north-west of the Troad region of Anatolia located at the mouth of the Scamander (the modern Karamenderes River). Sigeion commanded a ridge between the Aegean Sea and the Scamander which is now known as Yenişehir and is a part of the Çanakkale district in Çanakkale province, Turkey. The surrounding region was referred to as the Sigean Promonotory, which was frequently used as a point of reference by ancient geographers since it marked the mouth of the Hellespont. The outline of this promontory is no longer visible due to the alluvial activity of the Karamenderes which has filled in the embayment east of Yenişehir. The name 'Sigeion' means 'silent place' and is derived from Ancient Greek ("sigē"), 'silence'; in Classical Antiquity, the name was assumed to be antiphrastic, i.e. indicating a characteristic of the place contrary to reality, since the seas in this region are known for their fierce storms.
History.
Archaic.
Sigeion was founded by the Mytilenaeans from nearby Lesbos in the 8th or 7th century BC. Towards the end of the 7th century BC, the Athenians sent the Olympic victor Phrynon to conquer Sigeion. According to tradition, Phrynon and the Mytilenaean aristocrat Pittacus fought a duel in which Pittacus won by outwitting his opponent by using a net. During this war the aristocrat and poet Alcaeus of Mytilene wrote several poems about the conflict in which he related how he had fled from battle, lost his shield, and endured the shame of the Athenians hanging it up as a trophy in their temple to Athena. Most of these poems are lost except for a few lines, and it is thought that they constituted the major source of information about the conflict for writers in Classical Antiquity.
The Athenians appealed to the Corinthian tyrant Periander to arbitrate between the two sides as to who should rightfully control Sigeion. Periander found in favour of Athens, accepting their argument that whereas they had taken part in the Trojan Wars and helped destroy nearby Ilion, the Mytilenaeans were Aeolians and so had only arrived in the region at a later date and therefore did not have the prior claim to the land. Two inscriptions written in Attic Greek, dating to c. 575-550 BC, and attributed to Sigeion indicate that Athenians continued to live at Sigeion for the next half century. Archaeological remains at the Mytilenaean fort of Achilleion 7–8 km south of Sigeion indicate that throughout this period the Mytilenaeans maintained a hostile presence nearby, and in the 540s this resulted in Mytilene's recapture of Sigeion. The Athenian tyrant Peisistratus responded by recapturing Sigeion and making his illegitimate son Hegesistratus tyrant of the city. Sigeion remained important to the Peisistratids. After Peisistratos' son, Hippias, was banished from Athens in 510/9 BC, he spent his exile at Sigeion and minted coins which displayed the Athenian symbol of the owl and his own name as the legend.
Classical.
Sigeion maintained close relations with Athens throughout the Classical period. The Sigeans were loyal allies whom we find praised by the Athenians in an inscription from either 451/0 and 418/17 BC, and throughout the 5th century Sigeion was a member of the Athenian run Delian League. In the tribute assessments Sigeion belonged to the Hellespontine District, and in the tribute lists which survive Sigeion appears a total of 15 times between 450/49 and 418/17 BC; at the beginning of this period its tribute was a modest 1,000 drachmas, but by the end its tribute assessment had risen to 1 talent. According to the contemporary historian Theopompus of Chios, Sigeion was the favourite residence of the Athenian general Chares, who spent time there in the late 340s and late 330s BC. The 4th century BC coinage of Sigeion may belong to the period of his rule (335-334 BC). Continuing links with Athens, indicated by Chares' relationship with Sigeion, are also evident from the iconography of this coinage, which displayed a head of Athena on the obverse and an owl on the reverse. At some point in the 4th century BC (Aristotle simply says , 'recently'), Sigeion became embroiled in a land dispute with the nearby island of Tenedos to the south, although we know no further details.
Hellenistic and Roman.
In 302 BC King Lysimachus took Sigeion by force when it refused to come over willingly from the side of Antigonus I Monophthalmus. In 168 BC Sigeion sheltered the Macedonian fleet of Antigonus' descendant Perseus of Macedon. At some point after this, Sigeion was abandoned: in the latter part of Augustus' reign, the geographer Strabo described Sigeion as , 'a city which has been torn down', and in the mid 1st century AD both Pomponius Mela and Pliny the Elder likewise referred to Sigeion as abandoned. However, references in later sources indicate that the promontory continued to be known as 'Sigeion' for many centuries to come.

History of yerba mate

The history of yerba mate, that stretches back to pre-Columbian Paraguay, is marked by a rapid expansion in harvest and consumption in the Spanish South American colonies but also by its difficult domestication process, which even if discovered in the mid 17th century had to be rediscovered later when production was industrialized around 1900.
The consumption of yerba mate became widespread in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century both among Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaranís, who had to some extent consumed it before the Spanish arrival. Mate consumption spread in the 17th century to the Platine region and from there to Chile and Peru. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay’s main commodity above other wares like tobacco, and Indian labour was used to harvest wild stands. In the mid 17th century Jesuits managed to domesticate the plant and establish plantations in their Indian reductions in Misiones, sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild stands. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in the 1770s their plantations fell into decay as did their domestication secrets. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically. Brazil became then the prime producer of yerba mate. In Brazilian and Argentine projects in late 19th and early 20th century the plant was domesticated once again opening the way for modern plantation systems. When Brazilian entrepreneurs turned their attention into coffee in the 1930s Argentina, that had long been the prime consumer, took over as the largest producer, resurrecting Misiones Province where the Jesuits had once had most of their plantations.
Early use.
Before the arrival of the Spanish the Guaraní people, indigenous to the area of natural distribution of the plant, are known to have consumed yerba mate at least for medicinal purposes. Remnants of yerba mate have also been found in a Quechua tomb near Lima, Peru and has therefore been suggested to have been associated with prestige. The first Europeans to establish themselves in the lands of the Guaranís and the yerba mate were the Spaniards that founded Asunción in 1537. The new colony developed with little commerce and contact from outside and which made the Spanish to establish fluid contacts beyond labour relationships with the local tribes. It is not clear exactly when Spaniards began to drink mate but it is known by late 16th century to be widely consumed.
By 1596 the consumption of mate as a beverage had become so common in Paraguay that a member of the cabildo of Asunción wrote to governor of Río de la Plata Hernando Arias de Saavedra:
The same author of the letter went on to claim that Spanish settlers sold their clothing, weapons and horses or fell into debt to obtain yerba mate.
Spread across South America (1600–1650).
In early 17th century yerba mate had become the chief export of the Guaraní territories, above sugar, wine and tobacco which had previously dominated. The Governor of Río de la Plata, Hernando Arias de Saavedra, turned in the beginning of the 17th century against the burgeoning mate industry due to beliefs that it was an unhealthy bad habit and that too much of the Indian workforce was consumed in it. He ordered to end the production in the Governorate and at the same time sought approval from the Spanish Crown, which rejected the ban, as did also the people involved in production who never complied with the order. In contrast to other alkaloid rich cash crops found by Europeans in the Age of Discovery like cocoa and coffee, yerba mate was not a domesticated species and came to be exploited from wild stands long into the 19th century although the Jesuits domesticated it first in the mid 17th century.
Up to 1676, during the rise of the industry, the main production centre of yerba mate was the Indian town of Maracayú northeast of Asunción. In Maracayú, amid forests rich in yerba mate settlers from Asunción dominated production. Maracayú came however to be the place of long-standing conflict when settlers from the towns of Villa Rica del Espíritu Santo and Ciudad Real del Guayrá begun to move into the Maracayú area that the old settlers regarded as theirs. In the 1630 the conflict aggravated when settlers from Villa Rica and Ciudad Real del Guayrá and the Jesuit missions of Guairá had to flee over to the Maracayú area due to attacks from Portuguese settlers from São Paulo. In the Maracayú area the new settlers made mate their main income source sparking a conflict with the settlers of Asunción which only ended in 1676 when the Portuguese settlers made another push making Maracayú a rather exposed borderland zone. The settlers of Maracaýu relocated to the south forming the modern city of Villarrica and transformed their new lands into the new centre of the mate industry.
The conflict between the old and the new settlers in Maracayú coincided with the spread of consumption of mate beyond the colony of Paraguay, first to the trade hub of Río de la Plata and from there to Upper Peru (Bolivia), Lower Peru, Ecuador and Chile, becoming an important commodity in many cities of colonial South America. During the course of 17th century taxes on mate became an important revenue source in Paraguay, Santa Fé and Buenos Aires and became heavily taxed: Some of the taxes applied were the tithe, alcabala and municipal taxes through the cities where it passed. In 1680 the Spanish Crown imposed a special tax on yerba mate aimed to finance Buenos Aires defence works and garrison.
The shift southward to Villarrica of the production led Asunción to lose position as the sole hub of export downstream to Santa Fe and Buenos Aires. When production was centred in Maracayú transport down Paraná River was difficult and therefore the yerba was bought through Jejuy River to Asunción on Paraguay River which was navigable all the way down to Río de la Plata. The local government of Asunción tried unsuccessfully to have all mate produced north of Tebicuary River to pass through the city, but the Villarrica settlers as well as the Spanish Crown largely ignored the complains of the Asunción government.
Jesuit era and domestication (1650–1767).
The Jesuits began in the late 16th century to establish a series of reduction settlements in the lands of the Guaraní people to convert them to Catholicism. The Jesuit missions had a high degree of autarky but needed coins to pay taxes and acquire products they could not produce. While in early 17th century Jesuits had supported governor Hernando Arias de Saavedra ban on yerba mate production they became by mid 17th century severe competitors to the harvesters of the land north of Tebicuary River who had had a practical monopoly on the product. In 1645 the Jesuits had successfully requested the Spanish Crown to be allowed to produce and export yerba mate. The Jesuits initially followed the normal production procedure by sending thousands of Guaranís out into long journeys to the swamps where the best trees grew to harvest naturally occurring stands, where many Indians fell ill or died. From the 1650s to the 1670s the Jesuits succeeded in domesticating the plant, something that had been proved extremely difficult by contemporaries. The Jesuits kept the domestication as a secret, which seems included the feeding of birds with the seed or the emulation of the passing of the seeds through the digestive system of a bird. The Jesuit came to have series of commercial advantages to their competitors in the Tebacuary region. Apart from their successful domestication and establishment of plantations their missions were closer to the important trade hubs of Santa Fé and Buenos Aires and they succeeded in obtaining exemptions from the tithe, alcabala and the additional tax established in 1680. These privileges caused a conflict with the Paraguayan Asunción and Villarrica that accused the Jesuits of flooding the Platine market with cheap yerba mate and led to the imposition of limits for the Jesuit exports, which they anyway exceeded so that at the time of the expulsion of the order they exported four times the amount they were allowed to do legally. The Jesuits did not, officially, sold mate for profit beyond to pay basic necessities and taxes and accused the Paraguayans for causing prices to drop, adding that their yerba mate was preferred by merchants not due its price but due to its better quality.
Due to the shortage of coins yerba mate along with honey, maize and tobacco were used as currencies in the Jesuit reductions.
Expansion (1767–1870).
After the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1767 the production and importance of mate producing regions which had been dominated by Jesuits begun to decline. Excessive exploitation of Indian labour took of in the plantations leading to decay in the industry the scattering of Guaranís living in the missions. With the fall of the Jesuits and the mismanagement by the crown and the new entrepreneurs that had taken over Jesuit plantations Paraguay gained an unrivalled position as the main producer of yerba mate. The plantation system of the Jesuits did however not prevail and mate continued chiefly to be harvested from wild stand through the 18th and most of the 19th century. Concepción in Paraguay, founded in 1773 became a mayor port of export since it had a huge hinterland of untouched stands of yerba mate north of it. As part of the Bourbon Reforms free trade within the Spanish Empire was allowed in 1778. This and a tax reform in 1780 lead to increased trade trade in Spanish South America which benefited the mate industry. In the 1770s the habit of drinking mate reached as far as to Cuenca, in present day Ecuador.
During the colonial period in Europe, mate failed to be accepted like cocoa, tea and coffee did. In 1774 the Jesuit José Sánchez Labrador wrote that mate was consumed by "many" in Portugal and Spain and that many in Italy had proved it. In the 19th century yerba mate attracted the attention of the French naturalists Aimé Bonpland and Augustin Saint-Hilaire who, separately, studied the plant. In 1819 the latter gave yerba mate its binomial nomenclature: "Ilex Paraguariensis".
After independence, Paraguay was to lose its pre-eminence as top producer to Brazil and Argentina over the century, although Argentina went into a mate crisis. At independence, Argentina inherited both the largest mate-consuming population in the world as well as Misiones Province where most of the Jesuit missions had been and where the industry was in decay. The decline of production in Argentina relative to the constant increase in demand lead Argentina in mid 19th century to depend heavily on its neighbors for supply. Yerba mate came to be imported to Argentina from the Paraná highlands in Brazil. This Yerba mate was labelled "Paranaguá" after its shipping port. 
In Paraguay, yerba mate continued to be a major cash crop after independence with the foci of industry shifted from the mixed plantations and wild stands of Villarrica north, first to Concepción in late colonial times but by 1863 San Pedro was more important. During Carlos Antonio López rule (1844–1862) the yerba mate business was managed by the military commanders of the district, who could harvest yerba mate as a state enterprise or give concessions. The onset of the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) caused sharp drop in harvesting of yerba mate in Paraguay, reportedly of 95% between 1865 and 1867, caused by enrolment. It has been reported that during the war soldiers from all sides consumed yerba mate to calm the hunger and the combat anxiety. After the Paraguayan War against Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, Paraguay was demographically as well as economically ruined and foreign entrepreneurs came to control the yerba mate production and industry in Paraguay. The 156.415 km2 lost by Paraguay in the war to Argentina and Brazil were mostly rich in yerba mate production.
In Chile, where the habit of drinking mate had taken firm ground during colonial times its popularity decreased after independence favouring drinks popular in Europe, namely coffee and tea that entered the country through its increasingly busy ports. The spread of tea and coffee consumption in Chile, to the detriment of mate, began in the upper classes. The first coffee shop in Chile appeared in Santiago in 1808. German botanist Eduard Friedrich Poeppig described in 1827 a wealthy family in Chile where the old people drank yerba mate with bombilla while the younger preferred Chinese tea. The trend of decreasing mate consumption was noticed in 1875 by the British consul Rumbold who said that "imports of Paraguayan tea" were "steadily falling off". Yerba mate, was overall cheaper (price per kilo from 1871 to 1930) than tea and coffee and remained popular in rural areas of Chile.
Industrialization and spread to the Levant (1870–1950).
With the devastation of Paraguay and insignificant Argentine production, by the end of the 19th century Brazil became the leading producer of yerba mate. In the 1890s yerba mate plantations regained prominence in the markets when plantations began to be developed in Mato Grosso do Sul.
In the early 20th century Argentine production begun to recover, rising from less than 1 million kg in 1898 to 20 million kg in 1929 in Misiones Province. In the first half of the 20th century Argentina ran a state programme to populate Misiones Province and kick-start a mate industry. Family-sized parcels of land in Misiones were given to foreign settlers, most of them from Central and Eastern Europe. In the 1930s Brazil changed from mate to coffee production, as it gave more income, leaving the resurrected Argentine industry as the biggest producer, which benefited the Argentine economy as it was also the largest consumer of mate.
Syrian and Lebanese immigrants to Argentina spread the habit of drinking mate to their homelands, where it came particularity to be associated with the Druze.

Nyack Library

The Nyack Library is a free association library located in the village of Nyack in New York State. Established in 1879, The Nyack Library serves the residents of Nyack, Upper Nyack, South Nyack, Grand View, and Valley Cottage. In 1890, the library was incorporated and on June 5, 1894, it was entered under the New York State Board of Regents, by which means it received state aid. 
Origin & history.
In March 1901 the Trustees of the Nyack Library decided to petition Andrew Carnegie for funds for a library building. On December 21, 1901, Andrew Carnegie offered to give $15,000 for the erection of a library building in Nyack, if the village provided a suitable site and pledged by resolution to support the library with no less than $1,500 a year. On January 6, 1902, trustees of the library appeared before the Nyack village board to ask for an increase in funding by $187.50; the village had already been funding the library with $750 a year from 1894 - 1902. The new total was 937.50 annually. Carnegie offered to donate 15,000 for a building on the condition that the Nyack community raise not less than 1,500 annually.
Construction & costs.
The cornerstone for the new building was laid on May 21, 1903. The public reception for the opening of the new building was held on January 16, 1904. The total cost of the library was $15, 597, almost $600 more than the gift of Andrew Carnegie. The cost of the furniture for the building was $950. The architects were the Emery Brothers and Mr. J. B. Simonson. The mason contractor was John M. Rooney. The carpentry was done by E.H. DeBaun. Plumbing and gas fitting was done by A.L. Henry. Painting and decorating was done by Hill and Hubbell. 
The library expanded in 1973, 1993, and 2010. The grand opening of the renovated Carnegie building and the new wing was on May 7, 2011.

<doc id="31110695" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31110695" title="Reign of Doomsday">
Reign of Doomsday

"Reign of Doomsday" is a 2011 comic book crossover storyline published by DC Comics that ran through the Superman family of books, "The Outsiders" and "The Justice League of America". The crossover involves Doomsday hunting down Steel, Superboy, Eradicator, and Cyborg Superman, the four main characters introduced in the wake of the controversial "The Death of Superman" storyline in 1992. Though the current iteration of the character was not present in the original "The Death of Superman" storyline, Supergirl appears in the crossover as well due to being part of the Justice League. The storyline draws its title from "Reign of the Supermen", the immediate follow-up to "The Death of Superman".
Publication history.
The crossover began in January 2011 in the "Steel" one-shot published as part of the DC Icons line. The crossover continued in "Outsiders" 37, where Doomsday faced Eradicator, "Justice League of America" #55 and "Superman/Batman Annual" #5, both of which involved him facing Supergirl and Cyborg Superman, "Superboy" #6, where he faced Superboy, and "Action Comics" #900-904, where he faced Superman. The storyline concluded in #904, the final issue of the first volume of "Action Comics" preceding the title's relaunch as part of The New 52.
Plot synopsis.
When Doomsday lands in Metropolis, Steel fights the creature and loses. Doomsday takes Steel and departs from the scene.
Doomsday then attacks the Outsiders in Markovia, intent on finding Eradicator. After defeating Eradicator and his teammates, Doomsday flees the battlefield with his body.
Doomsday later attacks the Alpha Lantern Boodikka and several members of the Justice League. The Cyborg Superman emerges from Boodikka's body and reveals that Doomsday has come for him. 
Cyborg Superman wounds Doomsday, who then assimilates Cyborg Superman's nanotechnology and rebuilds himself into Cyborg Doomsday. Supergirl arrives and aids Cyborg Superman against Doomsday, but Doomsday overpowers them both and teleports away with their bodies.
Doomsday subsequently attacks Superboy. Superboy is overwhelmed, and Doomsday teleports to a large alien spacecraft on the ruins of New Krypton.
Superman discovers this was all part of a plot by Lex Luthor (who had previously been given Doomsday's corpse by Sam Lane) to distract him from Luthor's ultimate goal of finding a Black Lantern power ring. With Luthor defeated, Superman finds his allies trapped in a pocket dimension within a satellite. Superman attempts to free his allies, only for them to discover the inert body of Doomsday, as well as three separate clones - each with a different powerset designed to specifically make them capable of eliminating the Superman they were sent after.
Superman and his allies escape, taking the original Doomsday with them. Steel notices Doomsday is beginning to regain his brain activity when they are attacked by the Doomsday clones. The heroes are met by another Doomsday clone, Doomslayer. The Eradicator, against Superman's suggestion, fights the Doomslayer and is destroyed.
Doomslayer intends to crash the ship into Earth and attacks Doomsday. Superman defends Doomsday, believing Doomsday has the potential for redemption. The heroes escape the ship with the original Doomsday. Superman and his allies try to stop the ship from crashing, but are not strong enough. Superman advises Superboy, Supergirl and Steel to escape while he slows the ship down, intending to sacrifice himself. The ship falls in Metropolis's bay and creates a massive tidal wave. However, Superboy's tactile-telekinesis, Supergirl's cold breath and Steel's gravitron source dissipate the tidal wave, saving Metropolis. As Superman crawls out of the sea, Doomslayer attacks the city with the four Doomsday clones.
The Doomsday clones spread across the world, wreaking havoc. Doomsday awakens, but the Eradicator speaks through him. The Eradicator, as a being of pure information, leapt into the technology Luthor used to clone Doomsday so that he could control the original Doomsday. As the heroes fight the Doomsday clones, Eradicator begins to feel Doomsday's mind regaining control of the body. The Eradicator sacrifices himself to send Doomslayer and the other clones to a different dimension.>
Titles.
In addition to the "Steel" one-shot, the crossover includes issues of "Justice League of America", "Outsiders", "Superman/Batman", "Superboy" and "Action Comics".
Beginning with part 7, the storyline was retitled, "The Reign of the Doomsdays"
