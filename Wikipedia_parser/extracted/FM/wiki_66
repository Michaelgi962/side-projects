Joshua Hoyle

Joshua Hoyle (died 6 December 1654) was a Professor of Divinity at Trinity College, Dublin and Master of University College, Oxford during the Commonwealth of England.
Life.
He was born at Sowerby, Yorkshire, and educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford and Trinity College, Dublin, becoming a fellow of the latter. He received his doctor's degree, and was made professor of divinity in the university in 1621, after James Ussher resigned and the first choice John Preston and second choice Samuel Ward had turned down the position. A firm Calvinist, he clashed with Provost William Bedell. He was an assiduous teacher in Dublin, covering every book and verse of the bible and, when he had finished, starting again.
On the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, he took refuge in London, where he was made vicar of Stepney, replacing the royalist William Stampe. His preaching was found 'too scholastical' for his London congregation. In 1643, he became a member of the Westminster Assembly, and regularly attended its meetings. He was presented to the living of Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, by the House of Commons in February 1643. He gave evidence against William Laud as to his policy when chancellor of Dublin University.
He was employed by the committee of parliament for the reformation of the University of Oxford. On 8 July 1648, Obadiah Walker (a future Master of University College) and others were expelled from the university for their Royalist leanings. On 10 July, the Master of University College, Thomas Walker, lost his position as well. Hoyle was then appointed Master of University College and regius professor of divinity. Hoyle complained about money: a canonry of Christ Church, Oxford, which had been appropriated for the support of the professorship, was assigned to another before Hoyle's appointment, and the income of the Master of University College was small. He died on 6 December 1654, and was buried in the old chapel of his college.
Works.
In support of James Ussher against William Malone, he wrote "A Rejoynder to Master Malone's Reply concerning Reall Presence", Dublin, 1641. A sermon preached by J. H., printed in 1645 with the title "Jehojades Justice against Mattan, Baal's Priest", &c., is attributed to Hoyle.

Këshilla

Këshilla (literally meaning "Council"; ) was a local administration introduced in Thesprotia region in Greece, in 1942, by the Italian occupation forces. Italy's aim was to annex this region under Occupied Albania, but German authorities did not support this action and put it under the control of Athens. Several hundred Cham Albanians supported this authority, becoming the leaders of Këshilla, but the majority and the local leaders opposed it. This would be used as an excuse by EDES forces at the end of the war, to expel all Muslim Chams from the region, whether collaborated or not.
Background.
Following the Italian invasion of Albania, the Albanian Kingdom became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians, especially governor Francesco Jacomoni, used the Cham issue as a means to rally Albanian support. Although in the event, Albanian enthusiasm for the "liberation of Chameria" was muted, Jacomoni sent repeated over-optimistic reports to Rome on Albanian support.
As the final excuse for the start of the Greco-Italian War, Jacomoni used the killing of a Cham Albanian leader Daut Hoxha, whose headless body was discovered near the village of Vrina in June 1940. It was alleged by the Italian-controlled government in Tirana that he had been murdered by Greek secret agents. Hoxha was a military leader of the Cham struggle during the inter-war years, leading to him branded as a bandit by the Greek government.
Keshilla.
In October 1940, the Greek authorities disarmed 1800 Cham conscripts and put them to work on local roads. On the following month, after the Italian invasion, they seized all Albanian males not called up and deported them to camps or to island exile. Under these circumstances, as Italy managed to control Greece after the German invasion, several hundred Cham Albanians formed a local administration called Këshilla in 1942. These armed bands took part alongside the German army in burning Greek villages. But the local beys and the mufti did not support such actions. In 1943, this organization was completed with its own armed forces as well as a gendarmerie.
Although the Italians wanted to annex Chameria to Albania, the Germans vetoed the proposal. An Albanian High Commissioner, Xhemil Dino, was appointed, but his authority was limited, and for the duration of the Occupation, the area remained under direct control from the military authorities in Athens.

Wolfe Island Wind Farm

Wolfe Island Wind Farm is a large wind farm project located on Wolfe Island, Ontario (near Kingston, Ontario). The wind farm became operational on June 29, 2009. It is owned and operated by Canadian Hydro Developers, Inc., through its subsidiary Canadian Renewable Energy Corporation (CREC). The power will be purchased by Hydro One for distribution to consumers.
The wind farm consists of eighty-six 2.3-megawatt (MW) Siemens model Mark II wind turbines situated on the western portion of Wolfe Island.
Once completed, the 197.8 MW project is expected to generate approximately 594 gigawatt-hours (GW·h) of renewable power annually; enough to supply about 75,000 average households. In 2010 the windfarm operated at 24% of name plate capacity.
Winds of are required to generate power; when winds are less than , then power is not being generated.
Key project components.
CREC has optioned a total of approximately 2513 hectares (6,209 acres) of land for the proposed wind development.
The facility will provide green jobs and generate landowner and community income through royalties, taxes, and the amenities agreement. Canadian Hydro has built a visitor centre at its property on the 5th line.
The 2010 Bird and Bat report commissioned by Transalta, a component of the Post Construction Follow-up Plan (PCFP), states that over the first six months of operation bird mortality due to blade strike was 602 birds of which 13 were raptors. That reflects 6.99 birds per turbine over six months (almost 14 strikes per turbine per year). The industry standard for comparable wind facilities is generally 2 bird strikes per turbine per year. Over 1270 bats were killed in the same six-month period. The development is in a globally and continentally significant Important Bird Area. The PCFP was designed in response to stakeholder concerns over potential negative effects on bird populations, and is a partnership between Transalta, the Environment Canada and provincial Ministry of Natural Resources.

The Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) is an academically rigorous, internationally used, specialized, English language curriculum offered to students in the higher levels of secondary school intended to prepare them for an honours programme during tertiary education. The curriculum is overseen by Cambridge International Examinations, who first implemented the AICE in 1994. It includes classes in the subject areas of mathematics and science; languages; and arts and humanities with two levels of difficulty Advanced Subsidiary level and Advanced level with Advanced level being more challenging. It is mandatory for a student to have taken and passed a subject on the Advanced Level. Successful completion of the program within a thirteen-month period confers a Cambridge AICE Diploma. Three levels of diploma—Pass Level, with Merit and with Distinction—are offered based on the number of points that a student receives; these points depend upon factors such as the grade earned in an AICE class and the level of the class taken. To successfully complete the curriculum, a student must achieve at least 120 points with a minimum of six credits in courses spread across the subject areas.
The United States has identified AICE as a graduation option and acceleration mechanism through which students can be awarded up to 45 hours of college credit. Students earning the AICE Diploma in Florida qualify for the Florida Bright Futures Academic Scholarship while students completing the curriculum can earn the Medallion tuition scholarship.

<doc id="21535918" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21535918" title="Specker sequence">
Specker sequence

In computability theory, a Specker sequence is a computable, monotonically increasing, bounded sequence of rational numbers whose supremum is not a computable real number. The first example of such a sequence was constructed by Ernst Specker in 1949. 
The existence of Specker sequences has consequences for computable analysis. The fact that such sequences exist means that the collection of all computable real numbers does not satisfy the least upper bound principle of real analysis, even when considering only computable sequences. A common way to resolve this difficulty is to consider only sequences that are accompanied by a modulus of convergence; no Specker sequence has a computable modulus of convergence. 
The least upper bound principle has also been analyzed in the program of reverse mathematics, where the exact strength of this principle has been determined. In the terminology of that program, the least upper bound principle is equivalent to ACA0 over RCA0.
Construction.
The following construction is described by Kushner (1984). Let "A" be any recursively enumerable set of natural numbers that is not decidable, and let ("a""i") be a computable enumeration of "A" without repetition. Define a sequence ("q""n") of rational numbers with the rule
It is clear that each "q""n" is nonnegative and rational, and that the sequence "q""n" is strictly increasing. Moreover, because "a""i" has no repetition, it is possible to estimate each "q""n" against the series
Thus the sequence ("q""n") is bounded above by 1. Classically, this means that "q""n" has a supremum "x". 
It is shown that "x" is not a computable real number. The proof uses a particular fact about computable real numbers. If "x" were computable then there would be a computable function "r"("n") such that |"q""j" - "q""i"| < 1/"n" for all "i","j" > "r"("n"). To compute "r", compare the binary expansion of "x" with the binary expansion of "q""i" for larger and larger values of "i". The definition of "q""i" causes a single binary digit to go from 0 to 1 each time "i" increases by 1. Thus there will be some "n" where a large enough initial segment of "x" has already been determined by "q""n" that no additional binary digits in that segment could ever be turned on, which leads to an estimate on the distance between "q""i" and "q""j" for "i","j" > "n". 
If any such a function "r" were computable, it would lead to a decision procedure for "A", as follows. Given an input "k", compute "r"(2"k"+1). Note that if "k" were to appear in the sequence ("a""i"), this would cause the sequence ("q""i") to increase by 2-"k"-1, but this cannot happen once all the elements of ("q""i") are within 2-"k"-1 of each other. Thus, if "k" is going to be enumerated into "a""i", it must be enumerated for a value of "i" less than "r"(2k+1). This leaves a finite number of possible places where "k" could be enumerated. To complete the decision procedure, check these in an effective manner and the return 0 or 1 depending on whether "k" is found.

Zhovkva Castle

The Zhovkva Castle (; ) occupies the principal square of the town of Zhovkva in Ukraine. It was founded by Stanislaw Zolkiewski as his fortified residence. Construction began in 1594 and was mostly completed in 1606.
The castle had a typically Serlian entrance arch and was encircled by moats (up to 17 meters in width). One wing of the building accommodated the arsenal and stables; another was immediately contiguous to the city wall. In 1606, a garden was laid out next to the hetman's residence. It contained a menagerie with wisents, deers, and chamois. The palatine chapel was consecrated in 1640.
The golden age of the Zolkiew Castle was the late 17th century when it passed through inheritance to Jakub Sobieski and then to his son John III, a native of Zhovkva. It was there that the king celebrated his victory under the walls of Vienna. In the 18th century the castle's facade was decorated with the statues of its owners from the Zolkiewski, Daniłowicz, Sobieski, and Radziwill families.
After the partition of Poland the castle fell into disuse and was auctioned off. During the 19th century the chapel and some other structures were dismantled or rebuilt to accommodate a local school. The castle sustained further damage during the First World War. Some restoration was undertaken just before the Second World War, but much more was required following the end of hostilities.

Computable analysis

In mathematics and computer science, computable analysis is the study of mathematical analysis from the perspective of computability theory. It is concerned with the parts of real analysis and functional analysis that can be carried out in a computable manner. The field is closely related to constructive analysis and numerical analysis.
Basic results.
The computable real numbers form a real closed field. The equality relation on computable real numbers is not computable, but for unequal computable real numbers the order relation is computable.
Computable real functions map computable real numbers to computable real numbers. The composition of computable real functions is again computable. Every computable real function is continuous.

King's Manor School

King's Manor Speciality Sports School was a secondary school in Acklam, Middlesbrough, England. It was situated on Hall Drive and is next to Hall Garth Community Arts College; the two schools merged in 2010 to create Oakfields Community College. The new school combines both Performing Arts and Sports specialities. Hall Garth, being the least occupied, moved staff and pupils into the King's Manor buildings, and new school buildings were constructed on the Hall Garth site and opened in 2012. The school was also close to St David's School and Acklam Grange School.
Before closure, the school was in National Challenge as it consistently struggled to achieve more than 30% of students gaining 5 A to C grades at GCSE. Its neighbouring school, Hall Garth, was in the same situation.
The school funded the building of a school in Cameroon.
Subjects taught.
The school taught a range of subjects and as a Specialist sports colleges it was particularly known for the quality of its facilities for Physical Education.
Houses.
As a Specialist Sports College, the school was involved in a project called the Aspiring Sports College Project (ASCOP) and eventually became a national demonstration site. The project aimed to raise student aspirations through listening to their views and ideas and giving them a sense of belonging to the school. It was this work which led to the House system launch in 2005; the school was divided into houses named after the ships of the local hero Captain James Cook:
In line with a general trend for schools to listen more to the views of students, the concept of "student voice" at King's Manor was used to allow students to help review the way that houses and subjects operated and how teaching and learning was delivered.

Lindrick Golf Club

Lindrick Golf Club is a golf course in South Yorkshire and is also a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). The SSSI covers 22.0 hectares (54.4 acres) and was designated for its biological interest. The site was notified in 1987.
The course is situated on the main A57 trunk road running between Sheffield and Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and is situated approximately 3 miles west of Worksop. Although the course was affiliated to the Yorkshire Golf Union, part of the course is in Nottinghamshire and part in Derbyshire - the green on Hole 4 has parts in all three counties.
Founded in 1891, the course was originally nine holes, but was extended to 18 holes in 1894. The last major changes to the course layout occurred in 1932, to avoid two holes being played over the A57.
Currently Holes 1-11 and Hole 18 are situated on the south side of the A57, with Holes 12-17 being on the north side. Due to the problems in securing safety of large numbers of spectators crossing the road, major professional golf tournaments are unlikely to be held at the course in the foreseeable future. However by the end of June 2014 the course will now have two tunnels providing safe crossing of the A57. The course plays host to a number of leading amateur tournaments, and is a regular venue for Regional Qualifying for The Open Championship.
In 1957, the Ryder Cup was played at Lindrick, resulting in the only post-war victory for Great Britain & Ireland, captained by Dai Rees. The Curtis Cup was played on the course in 1960, and the Women's British Open has been held at the course on two occasions - in 1976 and 1987.

Modulus of convergence

In real analysis, a branch of mathematics, a modulus of convergence is a function that tells how quickly a convergent sequence converges. These moduli are often employed in the study of computable analysis and constructive mathematics. 
If a sequence of real numbers ("x""i") converges to a real number "x", then by definition for every real ε > 0 there is a natural number "N" such that if "i" > "N" then |"x" − "x""i"| < ε. A modulus of convergence is essentially a function that, given ε, returns a corresponding value of "N".
Definition.
Suppose that ("x""i") is a convergent sequence of real numbers with limit "x". There are two ways of defining a modulus of convergence as a function from natural numbers to natural numbers:
The latter definition is often employed in constructive settings, where the limit "x" may actually be identified with the convergent sequence. Some authors use an alternate definition that replaces 1/"n" with 2−"n".

Jennifer Ykema (born September 16, 1983) is a Canadian professional wrestler, better known by her ring name Jennifer Blake and is often referred to by her nickname "Girl Dynamite". She is best known for her work in Asistencia Asesoría y Administración in Mexico and Shimmer Women Athletes in the United States.
Professional wrestling career.
Debut and early years (2004–2007).
Blake made her first wrestling appearance in 2004 as a ring announcer. Following this, she transitioned into a managerial role and began acting as a valet for Derek Wylde and Cody Deaner while receiving training from Cody.
Shimmer Women Athletes (2008–2010).
Blake made her debut for Shimmer Women Athletes on April 26, 2008, where she teamed with Danyah to face the International Home Wrecking Crew (Rain and Jetta) in a losing effort. Later that night, Blake and Danyah were defeated by The Experience (Lexie Fyfe and Malia Hosaka). On Volume 19 on July 5, she made her debut in singles competition in a losing effort to Allison Danger. Later in that night on Volume 20, Blake and Danger lost to the Canadian NINJAs (Portia Perez and Nicole Matthews) in a tag team match. On October 19, she took part in a tag team tournament along with LuFisto. After eliminating the Canadian NINJAs, they were defeated by the International Home Wrecking Crew. Later in that night, she lost to Cheerleader Melissa in a singles match. On Volume 24 on May 2, 2009, Blake gained her first victory in singles competition by defeating Amber O'Neal. As part of Volume 25, she lost to Rain. Later in the night, as part of the Volume 26, she was defeated by Jessie McKay in a four–way match, which also included Kellie Skater and Melanie Cruise. She was scheduled for the 4th Year Anniversary on November 8, 2009, but was unable to appear due to the possibility to receive more training in Mexico. She returned to the promotion on April 11, 2010, when she teamed with Allison Danger to defeat Melanie Cruise and Annie Social in a tag team match.
Wrestlicious (2009–2010).
In early 2009, Blake took part in the tapings of Jimmy Hart's Wrestlicious, where she appeared as "The Ice Princess" Autumn Frost. On the March 10, 2010 edition of "Takedown", she competed in her first match for the promotion, defeating Paige Webb. On March 24, 2010, edition of "Takedown" she appeared in JV's Crib segment with Toni the Top and JV Rich. On the November 4, 2010 edition of "Takedown", she competed in the "Hoedown Throwdown" Battle Royal, but was eliminated by Alexandra the Great.
Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (2009–present).
In 2009, Blake branched out into Mexico, wrestling in the Extreme Air Wrestling ("Lucha Libre Extrema Aérea", EAW) promotion. She made her debut on June 6, 2009 in Teziutlán, Puebla, teaming with Derrick Nikerson (Neikirk) in a losing effort against John Scott and Ericka del Rico. On June 20, she picked up her first victory by defeating Sensual Rain in San Juan de los Lagos, Jalisco. On August 21, 2009, at "Verano de Escandalo" she made her debut for Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, initially using the ring name Jennifer Blade, before returning to her Jennifer Blake ring name. In the promotion she is part of the heel stable "La Legión Extranjera", led by Konnan. At the 2010 "Rey de Reyes" show her "Legión" stable mates Rain, Christina Von Eerie and Sexy Star faced off against Cinthia Moreno, Mari and Faby Apache, a match which Moreno won for her team by pinning Sexy Star. During a post "Rey de Reyes" interview Sexy Star claimed that the Apaches and Cintia Moreno were nothing but maids, which led to AAA booking a match between Cinthia Moreno, Faby and Mari Apache against Sexy Star, Rain and Jennifer Blade in a Triplemanía XVIII match where the person pinned or submitted would have to be the winning team's slave for a month. At Triplemanía "La Legión" defeated Moreno and the Apaches, when Blade pinned Mari, thanks in part to the biased refereering by Hijo del Tirantes. Following the match Konnan ordered Mari Apache to begin her maid duty right away by cleaning up their dressing room. The stipulation expired on July 6, 2010. On August 14, 2010 at Verano de Escandalo Blake teamed up with Alan Stone, Mini Abismo Negro and Yuriko in a losing effort against Cynthia Moreno, El Elegido, Octagoncito and Pimpinela Escarlata in a "Relevos Atómicos de locura" match. On March 13, 2011, Blake and her "La Sociedad" stablemate Alan Stone defeated Faby Apache and Pimpinela Escarlata to win the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship. In June Blake began accompanying the members of "La Maniarquía" to counteract Nanyzh Rock, the valet of their rival Heavy Metal. On July 31 at "Verano de Escándalo", Blake received her first shot at the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship in an eight-way elimination match, but was unable to win the title. After a seven month long hiatus from AAA, Blake returned to the promotion on July 27, 2012, when she teamed with Mari Apache in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Faby Apache and Lolita. On October 7 at "Héroes Inmortales", Blake and Stone lost the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship to Halloween and Mari Apache in a four-way match, which also included the teams of Atomic Boy and Faby Apache, and Fénix and Lolita. On November 27, Blake made her Japanese debut, when she took part in the 2012 Reina de Reinas tournament co-produced by AAA and Pro Wrestling Wave in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Blake was eliminated from the tournament in her opening match by Sexy Star. 
On February 3, 2013, Blake turned "technica" for the first time in AAA, when she was attacked after a match by Mari Apache and Taya, before being saved by Faby Apache, La Jarochita and Lolita. On March 1, Blake lost to her rival Taya in the first round of a tournament for the vacant AAA Reina de Reinas Championship, after interference from Mari Apache, Sexy Lady and Lufisto.

Sonohyan-utaki

While the gates were once opened only for the king, today they are always closed, and so the gates have in a way become a sacred space themselves, representative of the actual sacred space behind them. Many travellers and locals come to pray at the gates.
The stone gate was first built in 1519, during the reign of Ryukyuan king Shō Shin, though the space had been recognized as a sacred "utaki" prior to that. Whenever the king left the castle on a journey, he would first stop at Sonohyan-utaki to pray for safe travels. The site also played an important role in the initiation of the of the native religion.
The gate is said to be a prime example of traditional Okinawan architecture, and shows many signs of Chinese influence, along with a Japanese-influenced gable in the "karahafu" style. It was severely damaged in the 1945 battle of Okinawa, but was restored in 1957, and officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, along with a number of other sites across Okinawa Island. The "utaki", i.e. the sacred grove itself, was once much larger than it is today, an elementary school and other buildings having encroached upon the space.

Petronilla de Grandmesnil, Countess of Leicester

Petronilla de Grandmesnil, Countess of Leicester ( 1145 – 1212) was the daughter of William, one of three Grandmesnil brothers, and the wife of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester, known as “Blanchmains” (d. 1190). She was buried in Leicester Abbey following her death on April 1, 1212.
The chronicler Jordan Fantosme wrote that Earl Robert and his wife Petronilla were participants in the 1173–1174 rebellion of Henry "the Young King" against King Henry II, his father. Jordan claimed that Earl Robert participated because of grievances against King Henry and credits dismissive remarks about the English who were fighting on the king's side to the countess: "The English are great boasters, but poor fighters; they are better at quaffing great tankards and guzzling." Countess Petronilla accompanied her husband on his military campaign against English troops under the command of the earl of Arundel and Humphrey de Bohun. During the final showdown, she is said to have fled from the battle, only to be found in a ditch. "The earl’s wife wanted to drown herself, when Simon of Odell saw to pulling her out: ‛My lady, come away from this place, and abandon your design! War is all a question of losing and winning." She was noted as wearing male armour when captured. Earl Robert was also captured and his holdings were confiscated. Countess Petronilla was released and during the earl's continued imprisonment he wrote to her asking that she discharge the bequests stated in his father's will.
Family.
Petronilla claimed to be the heiress of the Grandmesnil barony, but the records do not record the names of her parents. She married in the mid-1150s and bore at least seven children:

Daniel Bertaux (born 27 February 1939) is a French sociologist. He uses biographies in the study of sociology, and studies social mobility and life histories. He has been active in the International Sociological Association, European Sociological Association and French Sociological Association (as founder and president). He edited "Biography and Society" (1981), texts presented in the World Congress of Sociology in Uppsala 1978. After the fall of the Soviet Union he collected and analysed life stories in Russia.
The life history method, previously known as part of the Chicago School and Polish Sociology, had largely fallen into disrepute in sociology until Oscar Lewis popularized the use of life stories in his "Children of Sanchez". Inspired by Lewis, Bertaux collected the stories of French family bakers to show how the lives of bakers, bakers' apprentices and their women were interconnected.

St. Lawrence's Church, Zhovkva

The Collegiate Church of St. Lawrence (Ukrainian: Костел святого Лаврентія у Жовкві; ) is the main Roman Catholic church of Zhovkva, Ukraine. It was built between 1606 and 1618 as the pantheon of the Polish commander Stanisław Żółkiewski and his family.
The building's design is attributed to a team of Italian Mannerist architects active in Lviv in the early 17th century. They include Paul the Lucky, Paul of Rome, and Ambrozy Przychylny. The building is raised on a terrace constructed by the Turkish captives. The hexagonal bell tower, originally part of Zhovkva's fortifications, leans somewhat to the east.
The frieze and some parts of the interior recall martial events. Especially notable are two statues attributed to Andreas Schlüter. The dome is heavily coffered. In the 17th century, the walls of the church were decorated with pictorial representations of Zolkiewski's and Sobieski's battles executed by Szymon Boguszowicz and Martin Altamonte, among others. They have since been moved to Olesko Castle. 
Apart from the Zolkiewsky, the church contains the family vaults of their relatives such as the Danilowiczy and the Sobiesky, notably Jakub Sobieski, John III's father. The church is often viewed as a shrine to the golden age of Polish military achievement; so much so that its ongoing restoration has been sponsored by the Warsaw University of Technology and the Polish military.

Ternate Sultanate

The Sultanate of Ternate is one of the oldest Muslim kingdoms in Indonesia, established by Baab Mashur Malamo in 1257. It reached its Golden Age during the reign of Sultan Baabullah (1570–1583) and encompassed most of the eastern part of Indonesia and a part of southern Philippines. Ternate was a world producer of cloves and a major power in the region from the 15th to 17th centuries.
The dynasty founded by Baab Mashur Malamo continues to the present, as does the Sultanate itself, although it no longer hold any political power. The current sultan is H.H. Sultan Drs. H. Mudaffar II Sya who assumed the title in 1975.
History.
Pre-colonial period.
The sultanate was originally named the Kingdom of Gapi, but later change the name base of its capital, Ternate. Ternate and neighbouring Tidore were the world's single major producer of cloves, upon which their rulers became among the wealthiest and most powerful sultans in the Indonesian region. Much of their wealth, however, was wasted fighting each other. Up until the Dutch completed the colonization of Maluku in the 19th century, the Sultans of Ternate ruled empires that claimed at least nominal influence as far as Ambon, Sulawesi and Papua. 
In part as a result of its trade-dependent culture, Ternate was one of the earliest places in the region to which Islam spread, probably coming from Java in the late 15th century. Initially, the faith was restricted to Ternate's small ruling family, and spread only slowly to the rest of the population.
The royal family of Ternate converted to Islam during the reign of King Marhum (1465–1486); his son and successor, Zainal Abidin (1486–1500) enacted Islamic Law and transformed the kingdom into an Islamic Sultanate; the title Kolano (king) was then replaced with Sultan.
The peak of Ternate's power came near the end of the sixteenth century, under Sultan Baabullah (1570–1583), when it had influence over most of the eastern part of Sulawesi, the Ambon and Seram area, Timor island, parts of southern Mindanao and as well as parts of Papua. It frequently engaged in fierce competition for control of its periphery with the nearby Sultanate of Tidore. According to historian Leonard Andaya, Ternate's "dualistic" rivalry with Tidore is a dominant theme in the early history of the Maluku Islands.
16th century to the present.
The first Europeans to stay on Ternate were part of the Portuguese expedition of Francisco Serrão out of Malacca, which was shipwrecked near Seram and rescued by local residents. Sultan Bayanullah of Ternate (1500–1522) heard of their stranding and, seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation, he brought them to Ternate in 1512. The Portuguese were permitted to build a fort on the island, today known as Kastella, construction of which began in 1522, but relations between the Ternateans and Portuguese were strained from the start. 
An outpost far from Europe generally only attracted the most desperate and avaricious, such that the generally poor behaviour of the Portuguese, combined with feeble attempts at Christianisation, strained relations with Ternate's Muslim ruler. In 1535 Sultan Tabariji was deposed and sent to Goa by the Portuguese. He converted to Christianity and changed his name to Dom Manuel. After being declared innocent of the charges against him he was sent back to re-assume his throne; however, he died en route in Malacca in 1545. He had though bequeathed the island of Ambon to his Portuguese godfather, Jordão de Freitas. Following the murder of Sultan Hairun at the hands of the Portuguese, the Ternateans expelled the Portuguese in 1575 after a five-year siege. Ambon became the new centre for Portuguese activities in Maluku. European power in the region was weak and Ternate became an expanding, fiercely Islamic and anti-Portuguese state under the rule of Sultan Baab Ullah (r. 1570–1583) and his son Sultan Said.
Spanish forces captured the former Portuguese fort from the Ternatese in 1606, deporting the Ternate Sultan and his entourage to Manila. In 1607 the Dutch came back to Ternate, where with the help of Ternateans they built a fort in Malayo. The island was divided between the two powers: the Spaniards were allied with Tidore and the Dutch with their Ternaten allies. For the Ternaten rulers, the Dutch were a useful, if not particularly welcome, presence that gave them military advantages against Tidore and the Spanish. Particularly under Sultan Hamzah (1627–1648), Ternate expanded its territory and strengthened its control over the periphery. Dutch influence over the kingdom was limited, though Hamzah and his grandnephew and successor, Sultan Mandar Syah (1648–1675) did concede some regions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in exchange for help controlling rebellions there. The Spaniards abandoned Maluku in 1663. 
Desire to restore Ternate to its former glory and expel the western power, Sultan Sibori of Ternate (1675–1691) declared war to the Dutch, but the power of Ternate had greatly reduced over the years, he lost and forced to concede more of his lands to the Dutch by an unjust treaty in 1683. By this treaty, Ternate had lost its equal position with the Dutch and became a vassal. However, the Sultans of Ternate and its people were never fully under Dutch control.
In the 18th century Ternate was the site of a VOC governorship, which attempted to control all trade in the northern Moluccas. By the 19th century, the spice trade had declined substantially. Hence the region was less central to the Netherlands colonial state, but the Dutch maintained a presence in the region in order to prevent another colonial power from occupying it. After the VOC was nationalised by the Dutch government in 1800, Ternate became part of the Government of the Moluccas ("Gouvernement der Molukken"). Ternate was occupied by British forces in 1810 before being returned to Dutch control in 1817. In 1824 it became the capital of a residency (administrative region) covering Halmahera, the entire west coast of New Guinea, and the central east coast of Sulawesi. By 1867 all of Dutch-occupied New Guinea had been added to the residency, but then its region was gradually transferred to Ambon (Amboina) before being dissolved into that residency in 1922.
Sultan Haji Muhammad Usman (1896–1914) made a last attempt to drive out the Dutch by instigating revolts in the region; he failed and was dethroned, his wealth being confiscated, and he was exiled to Bandung, where he lived his remaining years until 1927. The throne of Ternate was left vacant from 1914 to 1927, until the board of ministers under the blessing of the Dutch created Crown Prince Iskandar Muhammad Jabir the next Sultan.
Palace.
The existing sultan's palace was built in 1796 and restored in a semi-colonial style and is now partly a museum as well the sultan's home. The museum exhibits the genealogy of the Ternatean royal family from 1257, a collection of Portuguese and Dutch helmets, swords and armour, and memorabilia from the previous sultans.

National Organization for Rare Disorders

The National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) is an American non-profit organization aiming to provide support individuals with rare diseases by advocating and funding research, education, and networking among service providers. It was founded in 1983 by Abbey Meyers, along with individuals with rare diseases leaders of rare disease support groups, and it is a 501(c)3 tax exempt organization.
History.
The organization grew out of an "informal coalition" of support groups and families called together in 1982 to advocate legislation supporting development of orphan drugs, or drugs for treating rare diseases. They succeeded in getting the United States Congress to pass the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in early 1983.
The initial coalition was led by Abbey Meyers, whose son had Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is not a rare disorder, but Meyers' son was helped by an orphan drug. After passage of the Orphan Drug Act the coalition founded NORD with Meyers as its president. In 2007 Meyers announced her retirement from the NORD presidency; the president is now Peter Saltonstall.
Since its founding NORD continued to grow with the help of federal grants and donations.
Scope.
NORD's operations include funding research on treatment and cures for rare diseases; lobbying for legislation to benefit the rare diseases community (in addition to the Orphan Drug Act, NORD has helped bring about legislation on publicizing clinical trials on the Internet, and on the development of medical devices); spreading information about rare diseases; and helping individuals with rare diseases afford medication and treatment. In February 2009, NORD sponsored Rare Disease Day in the United States; this was the first time Rare Disease Day was observed in the United States (it was first observed in Europe in February 2008).

List of production functions

The production functions listed below, and their properties are shown for the case of two factors of production, capital (K), and labor (L), mostly for heuristic purposes. These functions and their properties are easily generalizable to include additional factors of production (like land, natural resources, entrepreneurship, etc.)
A production function can also be seen as the dynamics of national output/national income. This list is to collect production functions & the dynamics of national output/income that have been used in literature & textbooks.
Technology.
There are three common ways to incorporate technology (or the efficiency with which factors of production are used) into a production function:
Elasticity of substitution.
The elasticity of substitution between factors of production is a measure of how easily one factor can be substituted for another. With two factors of production, say, K and L, it is a measure of the curvature of a production isoquant. The mathematical definition is:
formula_4
where "slope" denotes the slope of the isoquant, given by:
formula_5 
Returns to scale.
Returns to scale can be
Some Famous forms.
formula_6, with formula_7 which includes the special cases of:
formula_14
The PAR production functions have such flexible limiting properties which are lacking in the CES technology. The Cobb-Douglas production function (a=0) as well as the Leontief production function (a→∞) are special cases of the PAR technology. The general form of the PAR production function is as follows:
Y = A*−L^\−a)/((D/L)^\-a*c-1)^\−(1/a) (a ≠ 0)(c ≠ 0)(D ≠ L)
If a=-1, then
 Y = A*c*(D-L)/[( D/L)^\c-1] (a = -1)(c ≠ 0)(D ≠ L)
 = A*(D-L)/[ln(D/L)] (a = -1)(c = 0)(D ≠ L)
In the above equation, Y is the physical output of production, D is input 1, L is input 2, “c” is the distribution limit parameter and “a” is the substitution parameter. Features of PAR technology are thoroughly examined by Tenhunen (1990).
Lauri Tenhunen, The CES and Par Production Techniques, Income Distribution, and the Neoclassical Theory of Production. Acta Universitatis Tamperensis ser A vol 290. Tampere 1990. http://acta.uta.fi/pdf/978-951-44-8581-7.pdf
Factors.
Some authors also propose "indirect" production function. Production function can be assumed to have more factors in play, and with some factors refined. For instance, formula_16 while formula_17 is the fixed capital, formula_18 is the working capital, formula_19 is the working labor, formula_20 is the management labor.

Harry Anders

Harry Anders (28 November 1926 – October 1994) was an English professional footballer who scored 30 goals in 225 league appearances in a 14-year career in the Football League with Preston North End, Manchester City, Port Vale, Accrington Stanley, and Workington. He helped Preston North End to the Second Division title in 1950–51 as well as second in the First Division in 1952–53; he also finished second in the Third Division North with Accrington Stanley in 1957–58. His brother was fellow footballer Jimmy Anders.
Playing career.
Anders played for St Helens Town, before joining Preston North End for the 1947–48 season. The "Lambs" were then a First Division club, but suffered relegation in 1948–49. Preston finished sixth in the Second Division in 1949–50 under the stewardship of Will Scott, before winning the division in 1950–51. They then finished seventh in 1951–52, before missing out on the Football League title in 1952–53 after finishing behind champions Arsenal on goal average. Anders scored four goals in 69 league games during his time at Deepdale. He then switched to league rivals Manchester City, who finished 17th in 1953–54, seventh in 1954–55, and fourth in 1955–56 under the stewardship of Les McDowall. Anders scored four goals in 32 top-flight games during his spell at Maine Road. He was signed by Port Vale manager Freddie Steele for "a substantial fee" in July 1956. However he only made three appearances in the 1956–57 season as the "Valiants" were relegated in last place in the Second Division. He was sold by new manager Norman Low to Accrington Stanley for "a small fee" in June 1957. Walter Galbraith's "'Owd Reds" finished as the Third Division North runners-up in 1957–58, seven points behind champions Scunthorpe & Lindsey United. New boss George Eastham led Stanley to a 19th place finish in the newly created Third Division in 1958–59, before they were relegated in last place in 1959–60. Anders scored 18 goals in 114 league games in his time at Peel Park. He scored one goal in seven Fourth Division games for Joe Harvey's Workington in a brief stay with the "Reds" at Borough Park in the 1960–61 campaign. He later played for Cheshire County League side Runcorn.

Manchester Environmental Resource Centre initiative

Manchester Environmental Resource Centre initiative (MERCi), is a Manchester-based environmental charity, so called because their first project was to establish an environmental centre at Bridge 5 Mill, in East Manchester.
MERCi promote social, environmental and economic sustainability for the city of Manchester. The Charity’s strapline is: "Ideas into Action for a Sustainable Future". According to their website, MERCI's aim is to work towards a future that is greener, safer, healthier and more equitable.
MERCi (pronounced 'murky') was established by a group of campaigners who were "frustrated by the lack of support, positive vision and available resources to make Manchester a more sustainable city".
History.
Four individuals: Chris Walsh, Helen Woodcock, Cath Miller and Jane Pickering established MERCi over five years beginning in 1996 culminating in the centre's official launch on 25 April 2001.
The group raised over three million pounds and project managed the refurbishment of the mill utilising funding from the National Lottery, Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, The Tudor Trust and European Regional Development Fund.
The Mill was refurbished with the support of volunteers and trainees and is one of Manchester's most environmentally friendly buildings. Manchester Civic Society acknowledged this in 2001 when Bridge 5 Mill won the award of Manchester's most energy efficient building.
A green roof was added in 2008 to encouarge wildlife to the building.
Activities.
Bridge 5 Mill.
Bridge 5 Mill was Manchester's first Centre for Change, a converted five story mill on the border of Beswick and Ancoats on the Ashton Canal, it was named after the fifth bridge on the canal: bridge number 5. It became "a focal point for debate and action around sustainability" It is home to a range of charities, campaign groups and green businesses. The centre provides community resources including conference and meeting rooms, a library, equipment hire and offices for voluntary groups and social enterprises.
Environment Network for Manchester.
The Environment Network for Manchester (EN4M) was established by MERCi and is based at Bridge 5 Mill. It is a membership organisation made up of groups and organisations which share MERCi's aim of improving the environment of Manchester, towards the development of a truly sustainable city.
Herbie.
Herbie is a mobile greengrocer set up by MERCi in 2004 to provide affordable, fresh fruit and vegetables to residents living in areas of East Manchester with poor access to fresh foods. Customers can walk on board and they also supply boxes of fruit to schools and community projects, working with sheltered housing, churches, health clinics and resident groups.

Killeen Castle, Castlegar

Killeen Castle is a 17th-century castle at Killeen, in Castlegar, County Galway, on the western coast of Ireland.
During the 19th century it was owned by the Blake Family along with an estate of over with a gatehouse on the N17 and a large house on the hill up from the gatehouse. In the early 20th century it was purchased a farmer from Tuam who was managing the estate. The castle was then sold by his son in the 1980s to Alic Finn. He then sold the castle to a German man who had once stayed in the castle. Since then the castle has been extended and made into a family home.
The castle was first built in the 17th century by the Normans and was placed beside an ancient church and a children's burial site. When purchased by Alec Finn it was renovated and stone from the church was used on the top of the castle.

Holy See–Ireland relations

Holy See–Ireland relations are foreign relations between the Holy See and Ireland. The majority of Irish people are Roman Catholic. The Holy See has an Apostolic Nunciature in Dublin.
Relations were strained in the 2000s after revelations of sex abuse cases in the Catholic Church in Ireland.
History.
Ancient links.
Ireland has had links with the Holy See since at least the time of Saint Patrick. Patrick was sent to Ireland by Pope Celestine I. Relations between Ireland and the Holy See continued through the appointment of bishops. of The Pontifical Irish College is a Roman Catholic seminary for the training and education of priests in Rome was founded in 1628. Irish Catholics were the main promoters of Catholic emancipation that was achieved in 1829 in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. From 1850 the Irish Church followed Ultramontanism under Cardinal Cullen and it became a conservative element in the Irish nationalist movement.
Irish Republic.
During the Irish War of Independence (1919–21) the Irish Republic hoped for recognition from the Holy See, which was not forthcoming. A memorandum from envoy Sean T O'Kelly to Pope Benedict XV made the case for Vatican recognition of the Republic. The United Kingdom envoy at that time was the count de Salis, a Catholic landowner in County Limerick who was not a supporter of Irish nationalism.
Irish Free State.
During the 1922-23 Irish Civil War Irish prime minister William Cosgrave asked the Holy See to recall its peace envoy, Monsignor Luzio, from "blundering around Ireland" and deplored that Luzio had met "with some of the persons in armed revolt against this Government and indeed against the social and moral order." His Minister for Foreign Affairs Desmond FitzGerald was sent to the Holy See to put forward the government’s point of view and its opinion of Monsignor Luzio. In turn when Luzio returned to the Holy See he was reported to have said that when he came to Ireland to meet the 26 bishops in the country he had instead "found 26 Popes". This was in part because the commencement of diplomatic relations after Ireland's War of Independence most Irish bishops felt that a nunciature would reduce their authority.
Following the 1929 Lateran Treaty between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See, other states including the Irish Free State exchanged envoys with the Holy See for the first time. Fianna Fáil deplored that the government had failed to consult the bishops about the diplomatic exchange. Éamon de Valera – together with many other senior clergymen – believed that the Holy See was pro-British and, therefore, opposed diplomatic relations with the Holy See. However, the first Nuncio, Paschal Robinson, who was appointed in January 1930, proved to be a popular choice with both the church and the state. Joseph Walshe became the first Irish ambassador to the Holy See in 1946. At the time, Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, told him that "you are the most Catholic country in the world." Walshe said that he believed Ireland’s relationship with the Holy See was of "a very special character."
The relationship was cemented by the 1932 Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, and Irish diplomatic protocol treated the Papal Nuncio "ex officio" as the "Dean", or honorary senior member, of the diplomatic corps. In 1948 the Irish Free State became the Republic of Ireland. In 1951 the influence of the Church was so high that the then Taoiseach, John A. Costello, said that: "I am an Irishman second, I am a Catholic first, and I accept without qualification in all respects the teaching of the hierarchy and the church to which I belong."
During the 1970s the Holy See watched with concern developments in Northern Ireland, and on 19 December 1974, Pope Paul VI expressed his hope to the Irish Ambassador to the Vatican for a peaceful solution in that area, but without expressing any opinion as to whether it should be part of the Republic of Ireland or the United Kingdom.
At a luncheon in Iveagh House in September 1985, Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter Barry told Cardinal Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli that the relationship between church and state in Ireland hurt the two major parties. However, he said that bishops in Ireland had a right to put forward their positions, but the Irish state would legislate for the common good. Between 1973-1977, Liam Cosgrave's (son of William Cosgrave) government had a rift with the Holy See over the actions of Nuncio Archbishop Gaetano Alibrandi in relation to Northern Ireland in which Cosgrave wrote a letter to the Holy See, and approved by Garret FitzGerald, which was read by Alibrandi as the "closest thing to a declaration of war." FitzGerald even asked for Alibrandi to be declared "persona non grata" but Cosgrave would not agree to the proposal 
In September 1979 Pope John Paul II made the first papal visit to Ireland.
Challenges.
The 2009 Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was one of a range of measures introduced by the Irish Government to investigate the extent and effects of the Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland.
Following an electoral victory, the Fine Gael government led by Enda Kenny took stronger steps against the church in Ireland. Speaking to the Dáil following the release of the Cloyne Report, which showed that Irish clerics partook in a cover-up to conceal the extent of child sexual abuse after the Vatican questioned the child protection guidelines adopted by the Irish bishops, he said that "the historic relationship between church and state in Ireland could not be the same again. The rape and torture of children were downplayed or 'managed' to uphold instead the primacy of the institution, its power, standing and reputation." On 25 July 2011 the Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Leanza was recalled to the Secretariat of State of the Holy See "for consultations" as a sign, among other things, of "surprise and disappointment at certain excessive reactions".
Non-residential status of ambassador.
On 3 November 2011 the Irish Tániste and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eamon Gilmore announced that Ireland would close its embassy in the Vatican, along with the embassy in Tehran and a representative office in East-Timor, and that the Irish ambassador to the Holy See would reside not in Rome but in Ireland.
Gilmore said the ""decision follows a review of overseas missions carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which gave particular attention to the economic return from bilateral missions"". ""In order to meet its targets under the EU-IMF programme and to restore public expenditure to sustainable levels, the Government has been obliged to implement cuts across a wide range of public services. No area of Government expenditure can be immune from the need to implement savings.""
The decision was highly controversial and opposed by former diplomats including retired ambassador Seán Donlon. The argument that it could not be justified on financial grounds was also questioned.
Since then, the Minister has been questioned several times in the Dáil about the status of Ireland's representation to the Holy See. On 17 April 2013, he replied ""The Government decision in November 2011 to close our resident embassy to the Holy See was taken with considerable reluctance as part of a necessary budget process to reduce costs. The closure of the resident embassy to the Holy See has yielded substantial savings, not least as it enabled the significantly larger embassy to Italy and the residence of the ambassador to Italy to be relocated to the State-owned Villa Spada, formerly occupied by the embassy to the Holy See, thereby saving €445,000 per annum in rent on two properties. Ambassador Cooney travels to Rome regularly and was present for the inauguration of Pope Francis, to which he accompanied the President and the Minister for Finance who represented the Government and subsequently at the Pope’s meeting with the Diplomatic Corps. I am satisfied that the current arrangement for Ireland’s representation at the Holy See is the most effective possible in light of the resource constraints faced by my Department. The resident embassy to the Holy See will not be reopened in the immediate term. I will, however, be keeping the deployment of our diplomatic and consular resources under review in light of ongoing national priorities and the availability of resources.""
Reopening.
In January 2014 it was announced that a residential ambassador would be reappointed. One senior Vatican figure said the reopening will mark “the end of a painful period” in Ireland’s relations with the Holy See. The reopening of the Embassy was announced by Eamon Gilmore as part of an expansion of Ireland’s diplomatic network which will see Embassies opening in Thailand, Indonesia, Croatia, Kenya and the Holy See. Officials also stressed that there would be no possibility of the Embassy being housed at its old site of Villa Spada which, in the meantime, has become the Irish Embassy to the Italy. The Ministry claims the new Vatican Embassy will be a “modest”, one-person operation
Archbishop Charles John Brown said: “It is an excellent decision for the people of Ireland and will be beneficial to Ireland in making its distinctive and important contribution to international relations. We are all grateful to those who worked so hard to make this day possible.”
State visits.
Irish dignitaries have visited the Holy See, including in 2007 the President of Ireland Mary McAleese, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Education and Science Mary Hanafin.

Byron Herbert Reece

Byron Herbert Reece (September 14, 1917 – June 3, 1958) was an American author of poetry and novels. During his life, he published four volumes of poetry and two volumes of fiction. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for "Bow Down in Jericho", his second volume of poetry, and received a Guggenheim Fellowship for fiction in 1952.
Reece wrote the words of his legacy in four lines:
General Biography.
Born in Union County, Georgia on September 14, 1917, Reece began publishing poems locally while in high school, receiving his first widespread publication in 1943 with the publication of "Lest the Lonesome Bird" in the "Prairie Schooner" journal. "Ballad of the Bones and Other Poems", collecting Reece's poetry, soon followed, in 1945. Reece was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for "Bow Down in Jericho", his 1950 follow-up to that first, critically acclaimed publication. That same year, Reece published "Better a Dinner of Herbs", his first novel. In 1952, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for fiction. 1952 also saw a third volume of poetry, "A Song of Joy", while 1955 brought his second novel, "The Hawk and the Sun" and his final volume of poetry, "The Season of Flesh". On June 3, 1958, Reece committed suicide at the age of forty, responding to illness and depression. During his final years, Reece also taught classes at Young Harris College to earn extra money. He was found in his office, with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart playing on the record player and his final set of student papers graded and neatly stacked in the desk drawer.
Byron Herbert Reece, the man.
In a career cut short by illness and suicide, Byron Herbert Reece produced an enduring body of poetry and fiction from the sounds and spirits of his North Georgia homeland. His five volumes of verse draw deeply from the lyrical wellsprings of Nature and the Bible, twin legacies of an upbringing in the agricultural uplands of Union County, around Blairsville. His two novels, in turn, are remarkable regional portraits - one a mountain family drama of overland journey to Old Testament rhythms, the other a morality play of a small-town lynching.
Reece was a bright and solitary schoolboy, a graduate of Blairsville High School who grew up in such rural isolation, the story goes, that he never saw a car until he was eight or twelve (depending on the version). He attended Young Harris College and taught school intermittently between 1935 and 1942, producing poem after poem for small journals and newspapers even while his parents’ tuberculoses led him to take increasing responsibility for the family farm. During these years, Atlanta Constitution editor Ralph McGill and Kentucky writer Jesse Stuart - themselves offspring of the rural Appalachians - early recognized Reece’s talent. He won American Poet magazine’s annual poetry award in 1943, and with Stuart’s sponsorship H.P. Dutton published Reece’s first volume of poetry, Ballad of the Bones, in 1945. By 1952, Reece had been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in poetry (for Bow Down in Jericho, 1950), profiled in a national magazine (Newsweek), and tendered a position as poet-in-residence at UCLA.
In the short decade of success Reece saw before illness, financial insecurity, and loss took their ultimate toll on him, he was much honored in his home state. Five times he received the Georgia Writers Association’s literary achievement award, and he served as poet-in-residence at both Young Harris College and Emory University. His books and honors never yielded much in money, however, and Reece’s labors never long allayed the financial worries that attended the harsh circumstances of the farm and family illness. He was teaching part-time at Young Harris to make ends meet, in fact, when depression and illness wore him down and Reece took his own life on June 3, 1958, three months shy of his forty-first birthday.
Legacy.
The Georgia Writers Hall of Fame inducted Reece in 2001, and in 2003 a group of writers formed the "Byron Herbert Reece Society". As of 2004, the Society was working on constructing a museum to the writer on the site of his family farm, which is owned by Union County. His life story is at the center of Georgia's state drama, "The Reach of Song", which depicts life between World War I and World War II in the Appalachian Mountains.
Georgia’s Appalachian Poet & Novelist.
The Byron Herbert Reece Society petitioned the Georgia General Assembly to name Reece “Georgia’s Appalachian Poet/Novelist" and to designate Highway 129 from Blairsville to Neels Gap "The Byron Herbert Reece Memorial Highway.” This was accomplished through the Georgia General Assembly's HR 295 which was passed in 2005.
Byron Herbert Reece Society.
The purpose of the Byron Herbert Reece Society is to preserve, perpetuate, and promote the literary and cultural legacy of the Georgia mountain poet/novelist, Byron Herbert Reece. In addition to enhancing both knowledge of and appreciation for his writings, efforts will be made to honor his way of life, with particular emphasis on his love of nature and his attachment to farming.
Byron Herbert Reece Farm & Heritage Center.
Visitors to the site will find a welcome center with a gift shop and museum; a Poetry Trail that highlights Reece poems representing the four seasons; Mulberry Hall, the poet's writing studio; five barn buildings housing 13 exhibits, which feature home and farm artifacts, implements, and enterprises that portray life in Appalachia during the first half of the 20th century; and the Reece Gallery & Theater, which displays photographs, books, copies of Reece's writings, and other Reece material, along with the award-winning video, "Voices … Finding Byron Herbert Reece."
Brochures guide visitors through the exhibits. An App is being developed. Docent-led tours are available by reservation to large groups, for a fee. A newly constructed pavilion is available for family reunions, weddings, and other events, for a fee. This is a great family experience.

Prozor Fortress

Prozor Fortress ( or ) is a medieval fortress situated in the continental part of Split-Dalmatia County, in inland Dalmatia, just above the town of Vrlika in Croatia. From its origin as a small stronghold built by the ancient Illyrian tribe Dalmatae, it developed into a fortress in the 15th century, during the reign of the Croatian feudal lord Hrvoje Vukčić.
Location.
Prozor Fortress sits prominently above the town of Vrlika. It was chain link of near by forts like fort "Glavaš - Dinarić" and "Potravnik". The closest large towns are Sinj, Knin, and Drniš. Prozor Fortress has an equally spectacular view of the Peruća Lake (Perućko jezero) and mountains Dinara and Kamešnica to the east and mountain Svilaja to the southwest.
Prozor Fortress is made of stone like other fortresses in Dalmatia. It is partially restored, and entrance is free of charge.
The way up to Prozor Fortress starts at the Roman Catholic parish church in Vrlika. It takes a car ride towards small village of Maovice, followed by a 25-minute walk along a dirt trail.
History.
Prior to the arrival of the South Slavs, the Dalmatae are said to have lived in the region. The known history of Prozor Fortress begins parallel with the history of Vrlika in the 7th century, when the Croats moved there and formed a village on the spring of the river Cetina, in a field below the mountain Dinara. In the 9th century probably during the time of Duke Branimir of Littoral Croatian Duchy, the old Croatian Catholic St. Saviour () was built near Vrlika, then called "Vrh Rike". 
In 1406, king Ladislaus of Naples gifted Prozor Fortress, at that time "Castrum Werhlychky", as a center of "Vrlička župa" to the Hrvoje Vukčić. 
Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić was a Ban of Croatia, Grand Duke of Bosnia and a Herzog of Split. He was the most prominent member of the Croatian House of Hrvatinić and the strongest of the three main large feudalists of early feudal medieval Bosnia. At the beginning of the 15th century, Hrvoje Vukčić fortified and strengthen the Prozor Fortress over the Vrlika valley to defend inhabitants from the invasion by the Ottoman Empire. After 1416, Hrvoje Vukčić die, but his son Balša Hercegović don't have power to hold Prozor Fortress, which then belongs to Ivaniš Nelipić, and later to Ivan Frankopan. 
In 1421, king Sigismund donated Vrlika with the Prozor Fortress to Mihača Nikolin Vitturi, but Ivaniš Nelipić refused to handover the fortress. When wealthy Prince Ivaniš Nelipić, the last male member of Frankopan's illustrious clan, died in 1434, the problem of inheritance became acute. According to his will, his only daughter, Princess Catherine or Margarita Nelipić, was to inherit all of his extensive possessions from the Velebit ranges to Cetina river. Her patrimony was argued and eventually shared by Frankopan. In spite of the legality of this bequest, and his consent to the marriage upon request of the late Ivaniš Nelipić, king Sigismund denounced the testament and demanded that Frankopan turn over to him the legacy of his wife's inheritance. When Frankopan refused to obey, Sigismund proclaimed him a rebel and deprived him of all honors and possessions. After that the fortress was lost to Venetian noble Mihača (Mikac) Nikolin Vitturi from Trogir, who was a commissioner of king Sigismund. 
The Turks invaded the fortress in 1522, and held it until 1688. After the fortress was taken, the Turks, disregarding the conditions of its surrender, massacred all within it. Of all the lords of the Prozor Fortress, folk tales best remember the bloody Suli-ma Muli-Hodzic. After the Turks, the fortress belonged to the Republic of Venice, the to the Austrian Empire, when it lost its main strategic importance. From 1805 to 1813, it was under French rule, and from 1813 to 1918 it again under the Austrian rule, as was all Croatia.
Architecture.
Prozor Fortress was built on isolated rock, deatached from the craggy clif on the end of mountain Svilaja range of hills. The remains of the Prozor Fortress are the ruins of a spacious residential building, a water tank, stone walls and a chapel. The Prozor Fortress was expended while it was owned by Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinićat at the end of 14th and early 15th centuries from the small stronghold built by the Illyrian tribe of Dalmatae. In Turkish times the "mahala", or the housing area of Vrlika fortress, developed around it. Prozor Fortress is dominated by the tall keep or donjon, around which is an open court with houses and a chapel. The courtyard is defended by the lower ramparts and a round tower. A drawbridge once gave access to the keep. Today's condition of Prozor Fortress is poorly, as the fortress is ruined, although slightly renovated.

Lincliff

Lincliff is a Georgian Revival house in Glenview, Kentucky, a small city east of Louisville, Kentucky where wealthy Louisvillians began building estates around 1900. Lincliff was built in 1911-1912 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
Description.
Lincliff is a three-story, stuccoed structure with a hipped roof, dormers and interior chimneys. The windowsills, lintels, and quoins are of limestone. The horizontal plan incorporates a rather simple entry on the south facade which leads through a compact vestibule and staircase to a transverse hall lined with north-facing windows. The hall, which has an elaborate, plaster strapwork ceiling, terminates in a parlor or salon at the west end and in a service wing at the east end.
On the north side of the house is a stone terrace overlooking the Ohio River. There had been no additions or alterations to the house when it was added to the Register in 1983.
The house has an extensive garden. In the 1940s and 1950s, garden designs were planned by Mary Louise Speed, a Louisville landscape architect. The site also contains two stuccoed cottages built in 1911-12, probably for servants, a gardener, or caretaker.
The property was listed as being significant because it is one of the finest example of the lavish houses built around Louisville, especially east of Downtown Louisville, between the American Civil War and World War I. According to its official inventory, "Lincliff emphasizes the aspirations of its builders in a manner which, although sometimes lavish to the point of extravagance, maintains a proper attitude of tradition, restraint, and task".
The original estate has gradually been subdivided, but the property retains .
History.
Lincliff was built in 1911-12 for William R. Belknap, president of W. B. Belknap and Company, then one of the largest wholesale hardware firms in the Midwest. The Belknap family is prominent in Louisville history, and lends its name to the main campus of the University of Louisville. William R. Belknap hired Charles Platt to design Lincliff, and he based the exterior appearance on a house he designed for William Maxwell in Rockville, Connecticut. Platt also designed the Speed Mansion, on Altagate Court, in Louisville.
William R. Belknap died in 1914, and the Belknap family sold the estate in 1922. In 1945, C. Edwin Gheens, owner of Bradas and Gheens Candy Company, purchased Lincliff with his wife. She lived in the house until her death in 1982. 
Helen Combs purchased the house in 1983. Combs was well known in Louisville for restoring, often saving from destruction or conversion to apartments, numerous Louisville mansions including Rostrevor, Gardencourt and Boxhill. Her renovation of Lincliff was featured as the 1983 Bellarmine Women's Council Designer's Show House. Combs lived in Lincliff for several years after restoring it.
Mystery writer Sue Grafton is the most recent owner of the house.

2009 Rally Norway

The 2009 Rally Norway, officially 3rd Rally Norway, is the second round of the 2009 World Rally Championship season and the first round of the Production World Rally Championship and is held between February 12 and February 15, 2009. The rally was held on ice and snow covered gravel roads between Oslo and Hamar.
Rally Norway returned to the calendar in 2009 Season after a years absence. This is the Snow Rally of the season. Historically, the Swedish Rally has usually been the rally held on snow in every WRC Season except 1974 and 1990 due to cancellation, 1994 when it was only part of the FIA 2-Litre World Cup for Manufacturers.
Petter Solberg, driving a Citroën Xsara WRC car, won the first stage of the rally. But Sébastien Loeb of France won in a Citroën C4 WRC, his second win on snow since the 2004 Swedish Rally, remaining only non-Scandinavian rally driver ever to win a Snow Rally. Loeb finished ahead of Mikko Hirvonen by +9.8 seconds. Jari Matti Latvala finished third, despite having spun on the last stage on the second running of the Budor. The highest placed Norwegian driver was Henning Solberg in fourth, who was in a tight battle for the position with Dani Sordo. Sordo had held the position for most of the stages until SS14 Mountain 2, where Solberg passed Sordo for fourth place. Both were under pressure from Swede P-G Andersson, on board a privately entered Škoda Fabia WRC, who passed Solberg at SS7 Finnskogen 2. Andersson had to retire at SS12 Ringsaker 1 when he broke his clutch after hitting a snow bank. Solberg finished in sixth in one peace, although he doubted his clutch would last until the end. He was in a tight battle with Matthew Wilson of Great Britain, who finished in seventh place, ahead of Urmo Aava in eighth who collected his first point of the season.
This rally marks the opening Round of the PWRC Season and as the WRC supporting event. Previously, the JWRC was the supporting event in 2007. Swede Patrik Sandell won the class.

Puce Moment

Puce Moment is a short 6-minute film by Kenneth Anger, author of the "Hollywood Babylon" books, filmed in 1949. "Puce Moment" resulted from the unfinished short film "Puce Women". The film opens with a camera watching 1920s-style flapper gowns being taken off a dress rack. The dresses are removed and danced off the rack to music. (The original soundtrack was Verdi opera music; in the 1960s, Anger re-released the film with a new psychedelic folk-rock soundtrack performed by Jonathan Halper.) A long-lashed woman, Yvonne Marquis, dresses in the purple puce gown and walks to her vanity to apply perfume. She lies on a chaise longue which then begins to move around the room and eventually out to a patio. Borzois appear and she prepares to take them for a walk.
The gowns used were owned by Anger's grandmother who had been a costume designer in the silent film era. Anger attempts to recreate silent era style by using alternating camera speeds. The film was made in the house of Sampson De Brier, a silent film actor, who later appeared in Anger's "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome" (1954).
Curtis Harrington was a cinematographer on the film. 
Yvonne Marquis moved to Mexico shortly after the film was made. Anger reveals Marquis was a mistress to Lázaro Cárdenas, the Former President of Mexico.

Biography.
Cricketer.
Docker was born in at Paxton House, Smethwick, Staffordshire, the son of Ralph Docker and his wife Sarah Sankey. His father was a solicitor in practice at Birmingham and Smethwick who took on a large number of public appointments He went King Edward's School, Birmingham but appears to have resisted formal schooling and left early.

From 1884 to 1886 he played a few games for Warwickshire, two games for Gentlemen of Warwick in 1887 and 1888 and one game again for Warwickshire in 1889.
Paint and varnish.
In 1886 a third brother Ludford joined Docker Brothers and the death of his father in 1887 brought more capital into the firm. The varnish business grew into more general paint supply, and in 1894 the company opened a London office reflecting their success in winning orders from railway and rolling stock companies and Docker developed his interest and success in making deals. In 1902 he arranged the amalgamation of five rolling stock companies into the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company, one of the largest business combines of the time which in 1911 employed 14,000 people and occupied of factory space. In 1906 he became a director of Birmingham Small Arms Company, the arms manufacturer which also grew into a leading motorcycle company. In 1908 he became a director of W & T Avery Ltd., manufacturers of weighing equipment. He became a J. P. in 1909 and his interests diversified into railways with directorship of Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway from 1909 to 1912, the Metropolitan Railway from 1915 to 1933, London, Brighton and South Coast Railway from 1918 to 1922 and then the Southern Railway until 1938. He was the chairman of Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon during World War I, constructing the first tanks.
Death, family, and recognition.
Docker and his family moved to Kenilworth at the beginning of the 20th century and in 1935 moved to Coleshill House, Amersham, Buckinghamshire, where Docker died. He had also acquired a flat in Berkeley Square Mayfair in 1923.
Docker married Lucy Constance Hebbert in 1895. Their only child Bernard Docker succeeded his father in his business enterprises. In addition to Ludford, Docker's elder brother Ralph Docker also played cricket for Derbyshire.
Docker was a substantial benefactor (£10,000) toward Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1914–1916. In recompense for donations toward the success of the expedition, Shackleton named one of the lifeboats aboard the expedition vessel the "Dudley Docker". The benefaction proved significant when the expedition vessel sank and the castaways were forced to use the "Dudley Docker" for survival.

Knut Olai Thornæs

Knut Olai Thornæs (1874 – 1945) was a Norwegian newspaper editor and politician. He was a member of the Labour Party from 1900, and represented the party politically, but joined the Communist Party upon the split in 1923. He was the editor-in-chief of several newspapers, most notably "Ny Tid".
Career.
He hailed from Kristiansund. Having first worked a few years as a manual laborer, in 1893 he completed his typographer's education, and moved to Trondhjem. He became involved in his local trade union, and in 1900 he joined the Norwegian Labour Party.
He published the temperance periodical "Reform" in 1901, but was soon hired as a journalist in "Folketidende". In 1902 he was hired in the local Labour Party organ, "Ny Tid". He worked here for many years, except for the period between 1906 and 1908, when he edited a Fredrikstad newspaper, "Smaalenenes Social-Demokrat". Thornæs was elected to serve in Trondhjem city council in 1914, and was re-elected several times. In 1921 Thornæs took over as editor-in-chief of "Ny Tid".
It was a turbulent time for the Labour Party, and in 1923 the party was nearing a split. In September 1923 Thornæs was excluded from the party for half a year for writing about Martin Tranmæl that he had either "lost his mind", or was a "provocateur" and "class traitor". The party then split over disagreements of its alignment to Comintern, and the wing that supported Comintern and the Twenty-one Conditions, broke away to form the Communist Party of Norway. Thornæs belonged to this wing, and as the communists usurped "Ny Tid" as their party organ, Thornæs could continue as editor-in-chief until 1934. He also represented the Communist Party in the city council. He ran twice for Parliament, in 1930 and 1933, but was not elected.
Thornæs also composed songs and poems, with overtones of class struggle. His most known song is "Fram kamerater" ('Forward, Comrades'), which was published for the first time in "Ny Tid" in 1911. He was also interested in church music and theater. He was a member and chairman of the board of Trondheim public library in the late 1930s.
Legacy.
In 1955, a sculpture commemorating Thornæs was erected at Møllenborg in Trondheim. The park in which the sculpture stands was named Thornæsparken. Also, a road in Trondheim has been named after him.
His daughter Signe Kristine married twice, the last time to social democratic politician and newspaper editor Ole Øisang.

SONITEL

SONITEL (an acronym of Société Nigérienne des Télécommunications or Nigerien Telecommunications Society) is the Nigerien national telephone and telecommunications carrier. It was created in 1997 as a fusion of the telecommunications arm of Nigerien Posts and Telecommunications (Office des Postes et Télécommunications – OPT, the Postal Office) and the STIN (Société des Télécommunications Internationales du Niger / International Telecommunications Society of Niger) which controlled land line telephone connections abroad. The process had begun with the passage of a law aimed at the privatisation of telecommunications ("Ordonnance N°96-031 du 11 juin 1996"), and was part of a larger process of internationally led privatisation of Niger's once large Parastatal sector. SONITEL had the government of Niger as a majority share holder. Following the 1999 Constitution of the Fifth Republic of Niger, SONITEL was to be privatised, and in 2001, after an unsuccessful round of offerings, the majority of the companies shares were sold. In December 2001, 51% of the company was purchased by the Sino-Libyan consortium DATAPORT, made up of the Libyan LAAICO company and the Chinese ZTE. The ZTE majority consortium reportedly paid 11.8 billion FCFA, beating out FranceTelecom and SONATEL The government of Niger continued to hold 34.11% of the company, with private investors taking 11%, the 1300 employees of SONITEL holding 3%, and France Câbles & Radio – who had been a stakeholder in STIN, 0.89%. In 2004, SONITEL's mobile phone arm SAHEL-TEL was opened up to face foreign competition, but SONITEL continued to hold a monopoly on Internet communication, .ne name registry, and international fixed line voice communication.
Following mobile phone competition, SONITEL was widely criticised for poor performance, faced a series of protests and strikes by its workers over pay and conditions, and accumulated debts of 40 billion FCFA despite a 140% increase in user fees. On 13 February 2009, the government of Niger announced it was "canceling" the privatisation of SONITEL, although it hoped to eventually re-privatise the company. The Minister of Communications stated that the process had "failed", and the government would retain a 100% share in SONITEL, and form a new administration of the company.

Global markets.
Some models are imported from India to Japan (its mother company´s location). Japanese tuners like Daytona produce special parts for it.
Yamaha Motor Kencana Indonesia also launched the FZ-16 under the name Yamaha Byson with few specification changes.
The Yamaha FZ16 is also manufactured in Colombia and Argentina, it is exported to the rest of Latin America with extraordinary success.FZ16 was the best selling bike below 200cc at great performance. In Chile and Argentina it is reportedly difficult to acquire one directly due to its attractive sporty look and high demand. In Argentina Yamaha dealers are said to charge up to 40% price increases due to scarcity. Motomel (an Argentine motorcycle company) has deliberately copied the design of the model to "create" its Motomel Sirius 200 with a 200 cc displacement.

¿Quién maneja mi barca?

"¿Quién maneja mi barca?" (, "") was the Spanish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983, performed in Spanish by flamenco singer Remedios Amaya.
Musically the song is in the late 70s - early 80s genre 'flamenco-rock', also referred to as New Flamenco, which fused Spain's Arabic, Andalusian, Sephardic and Gypsy heritage with contemporary Anglosaxon pop and rock instrumentation, in this case from 80s synthpop; with the exception of bass and electric guitar the studio recording of "¿Quién maneja mi barca?" has a soundscape predominantly made up of drum machines, synthesizers and vocoders. When performed live at Eurovision in Munich these were however replaced by live drums, brass and woodwind.
Lyrically the song mirrors the music's dramatic nature, focussing on emotions of love, passion and jealousy by posing a series of metaphorical questions. The central theme is: ""Who sails my boat? It's drifting away from me. Tell me, who sails my boat?"" and in the verses: ""Your mother's braids, tell me, who braids them?"". In the bridge Amaya confesses: ""Whatever you ask of me, I'll give it to you."" and then returns to the song's central question; ""Who sails my boat?"".
Remedios Amaya's performance of the song on stage in Munich, singing with the traditional Spanish 'cantaora' technique and dancing barefoot, was at the time described by BBC commentator Terry Wogan as ""tempestuous"" and ""very, very ethnic indeed"".
The song was performed 7th on the night, following Turkey's Çetin Alp and The Short Waves with "Opera" and preceding the Switzerland's Mariella Farré with "Io cosi non ci sto". At the close of voting, it had received 0 points, placing 19th (equal last) in a field of 20.
It was succeeded as Spanish representative at the 1984 contest by Bravo with "Lady, Lady".

They were severed on June 1, 1939 and were restored on October 10, 1945. First Czechoslovakian representatives at Sofia were chargé d'affaires Rudolf Künzl–Jizerský (1920–1922), ambassador Bohdan Pavlů (1922–1927), ambassador Václav Rejholec (1927–1931) and ambassador Prokop Maxa (1931–1939).

Interwar relations were deeply influenced by Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakian ally, but Bulgarian rival. Czechoslovakia had to balance between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important aspect of Bulgaria-Czechoslovakia relationship was trade. The Czechoslovakian interwar export to Bulgaria varied between 3% and 11% of the Bulgarian import. Otherwise it was about 0,5%. Czechoslovakian export was slowly forced out by Germany in the late thirties, but not as much as France or United Kingdom.
On December 23, 1992, Bulgaria recognised the Czech Republic and established diplomatic relations with it at the level of embassies as of January 1, 1993.
Bulgaria has an embassy and an honorary consulate in Prague. Czech Republic has an embassy in Sofia and an honorary consulate in Varna.

Algeria–Ukraine relations are foreign relations between Algeria and Ukraine. Algeria recognized Ukraine’s independence in 1992. Diplomatic relations between both countries were established in 1993.
Algeria has an embassy in Kiev. Ukraine has an embassy in Algiers (opened in 1999).
History.
Algeria recognized Ukraine’s independence in 1992. Diplomatic relations between both countries were established in 1993. Soon (1993–1994), military and trade agreements between two countries were signed.
The USSR being one of the major supporters of independent Algeria, the economic connections between the Soviet Ukraine and Algeria were fairly significant, since a large portion of Soviet industries (in particular, of the aerospace industry), as well as the major port of Odessa were located in that republic. After Ukraine declared its independence, economic connections between the two countries continued, Algeria and Egypt remaining, as of the early 2000s, the two most important trade partners of Ukraine in the region of Africa and the Middle East.
Political contacts between the two countries lagged the development of economic contacts; it was not until 2002 that the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko visited Algeria the first. As Ukrainian analysts noted at the time, one of Ukraine's priorities in the development of its relations with the North African countries at the time was extending the spectrum of economic relations: moving from exporting metals, chemicals, and foodstuffs to selling civilian and military aircraft and other high-tech products. A Ukrainian products' exhibition, "Algeria-Ukraine 2002" took place in Algeria the same year, and a tax treaty was signed.
The overall volume of trade between the two countries reached US$355 million in 2003. That included at least some amount of weapons trade. For example, it was reported that in 2003 Ukraine sold to Algeria 5 MiG-29 fighters and 16 Mi-24 helicopters, buying back some old MiG-21s.
A bilateral agreement on cooperation in the peaceful use of outer space was reached in 2007.
In 2008, capitalizing on the large "installed base" of Soviet-made (that is, often, produced in Ukraine) equipment used by the Algerian military, Ukraine reached an agreement with Algeria concerning provision of maintenance, repair, and upgrade services. The agreement, which also provided for exchanging military attachés, was signed by the two countries defense ministers during the visit of the Ukrainian Defense Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov to Algeria. According to the news reports, Algerian top officers visiting Ukraine were reported as particularly interested in visiting Ukrainian aerospace companies (such as Antonov and Luch), and the armored vehicles repair plant in Kiev.
Ukraine's trade with Algeria in 2009 was worth $300 million, but in recent years trade between Ukraine and Algeria has fallen.

Electrification of Saint Petersburg Railway Division

Electrification of Saint Petersburg Railway Division. Direct lines from Saint Petersburg Finlyandsky-Vyborg and Saint Petersburg Finlyandsky-Beloostrov through Sestroretsk continued to work with steam haulage after the Russian Revolution up to World War II.
First project.
In 1930, the first project for electrification of a railroad line of seashore-Beloostrov rings was developed. But the state boundary was in the Urban-type settlement Beloostrov, and the authorities did not improve the transport accessibility area. They rightly believed that the availability of suburban passenger electric trains would increase the number of summer residents in direction of traffic.
Implementation.
Without waiting for the end of the war, the chief of department of electrification of the October Railway Kirillov made an application for electrification of the seashore-Beloostrov rings and directions to station Terioki addressed to the Leningrad city town committee VKP managing transport department. After the war, the state border was pushed to a distance of more than 100 kilometers (over Vyborg) and the electrification program was not hampered.
Documents.
Documents were issued on the basis of which the electrification of the Leningrad – Zelenogorsk line was authorized:

Plot.
52 Pick-Up is the first story arc (issues 1-6) of the series. Booster traveled through the ravaged time stream with Skeets and Rip Hunter to repair the damage done during "52" and to stop a group of supervillains that were exploiting temporal anomalies to eliminate the world's greatest heroes. Booster failed to save Barbara Gordon from being paralyzed and wished to try again, but Rip told him that the event was fated. Angry at Rip and wanting to save Ted Kord after Rip refused, Booster is visited by Dan Garret, Jaime Reyes, and a future Blue Beetle.
Blue and Gold covered issues 0, 7-10, and 1000000. Booster tried to save his best friend, Ted Kord, from being murdered, but the resulting change to the time stream created a wormhole of problems. Realizing the time stream would never be right as long as he's alive, Ted sacrifices his life. Rip perked Booster up by showing him that he had rescued his sister, Michelle, unbeknownst to her.

When Batman, Robin, and Batgirl foiled a heist conducted by Killer Moth at the behest of 27th century time-traveler Wiley Dalbert, they were removed from the timeline.

Meanwhile, Michelle discoveres that she was supposed to die and is alive because of Rip. Feeling angry and betrayed, she runs away in time to live her own way.

Dead Ted, a "Blackest Night" tie-in, ran in issues 26-27. Ted Kord is reanimated as a Black Lantern and tries to kill Booster. Booster teams up with Jaime Reyes to survive. After failing to defeat him with their hands or energy blasts, they discover that Black Lanterns are vulnerable to light. They grab a light gun from Ted's industries and defeat Kord. Later, they go to Vanishing Point and give him a proper burial.
The Tomorrow Memory covered issues 28-31. Rip sends an unwilling Booster to stop the murder of Hank Henshaw, who would soon become Cyborg Superman. Time-traveling assassin Sondra Crain arrives in Coast City to murder Henshaw. When Booster meets her, she persuades him to help stop Cyborg Superman from mass murder.
During Cyborg Superman's attack, Booster and Skeets are able to save only Sondra Crain, Grace Greene and Michelle. Elsewhere, on Vanishing Point, Booster's future self meets with Rip. He reveals that Rip did not train the younger Booster alone and that he will become the hero that he is destined to be. In the present Rip counsels an angry and sad Booster, who patches things up with Michelle and saves a girl's dog he had unintentionally killed earlier. Rip then goes to Vanishing Point and is notified that something is wrong with the timeline. (see "")
The tenth story arc (beginning in issue 32) ties in with the events of "" and "Brightest Day" #0. After retrieving Doctor Fate's helmet, Booster discovers that Maxwell Lord is alive and after Lord erases the memory of his existence, only Booster, Skeets, Captain Atom, Fire, and Ice remember him. Booster then goes back to see if Lord is remembered and to find evidence to prove Lord's existence without success.
Turbulence, a "Flashpoint" tie-in story, finished the series over issues 44–47. After the "Time Masters: Vanishing Point" event, Rip informs them that someone sneaked into their base and left a message on the chalkboard. When an alternate timeline starts due to the machinations of the Flash, Booster and Skeets awaken and are the only ones who remember the original timeline. Booster travels to Coast City, but US soldiers mistakenly attack him as an Atlantean threat. Skeets is damaged by the military's Project Six, which is revealed to be Doomsday. During the battle Booster Gold discovers that Doomsday is controlled by General Nathaniel Adam. Booster escapes from Doomsday and saves a woman named Alexandra Gianopoulos. Booster learns the timeline has been changed, suspecting that Professor Zoom was behind it. Alexandra and Booster Gold split up, but she uses her secret powers to take others' powers and follows him. Later, he flies to Gotham City and Doomsday attacks him. Alexandra destroys Adam's control link in an attempt to rescue Booster. An uncontrolled Doomsday attacks Booster. Doomsday beats Booster nearly to death, but he is rescued by Alexandra. Booster manages to put Doomsday's helmet back on, restoring control to General Adam, who grabs Booster, hoping to kill him. Fortunately, General Adam takes Booster back to the base for interrogation, allowing him to escape when the sight of "Project Superman" causes Doomsday's true personality to resurface again. Alexandra manages to defeat Doomsday by using the control helmet to make Doomsday tear himself apart, subsequently asking Booster to take her with him. However, Alexandra subsequently sacrifices herself to save him from an Atlantean attack. Booster returns to Vanishing Point as history resets itself, without any clear memory of his time in the "Flashpoint" universe. Alexandra leaves the message on the chalkboard and vanishes.

Imperial Continental Gas Association

Imperial Continental Gas Association plc was a leading British gas utility operating in various cities in Continental Europe . It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
History.
The Company was formed by Sir Moses Montefiore and some of his colleagues based in London in 1824 as the "Imperial Continental Gas Association" to establish gas utilities in other counties. It commenced operations distributing gas in Hannover in 1825 and providing gas lighting in Berlin in 1826 under the supervision of the Prussian Count Eduard of Dyhrn-Waldenburg-Schoenau. During the course of the 19th century it established gas works in Antwerp, Brussels, Berlin and Vienna. Its operations in Vienna began in the mid-1840s; the head office from 1883 to 1902 was at the Palais Epstein. 
The noted philanthropist Goodwin Newton of Barrells Hall, and Glencripesdale Estate was Director and Chairman for a long period in the late nineteenth century.
It established the "Westergasfabriek" gas works in Amsterdam in 1883.
In 1928 it established Distrigas, the main gas distributor in Belgium, which is now owned by Eni. During World War I its operations in Berlin were nationalised by the German Government.
In 1969 the Company acquired all the shares in Calor Group that it did not already own.

<doc id="21537012" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21537012" title="I Got My Education">
I Got My Education

"I Got My Education" was the first single released from the Uncanny Alliance LP, "The Groove Won't Bite", released as a CD single and 12". The song went to number two for two weeks on the US dance chart.
The song, which is said to be a response to the Crystal Waters track "Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)", mostly consists of spoken word vocal samples performed by lead singer/vocalist E.V. Mystique. She is speaking to an unidentified female character who has apparently lost her job after giving her boss a bad attitude, resulting in homelessness. The song has a high camp value and was very popular in gay dance clubs. A sample lyric: "Attitude, attitude was all she sent/Now she can't afford antiperspirant/Books and school just give you the blues/But oh, dear girl, where are your shoes?"
The title of the song is ironic, as though acceptable it is technically grammatically incorrect (the correct phrasing being 'I have gotten my education'). This aspect was, however, lost in other countries, since "gotten" - though technically correct - is not commonly used outside the USA and the title would generally be considered standard English.
The single was first released as a white label 12" vinyl single given out to club DJ's. The song became so popular that record labels began vying to sign the band. During this process, the single was heavily bootlegged and sold by unscrupulous individuals who obtained the promotional white label single. As a result, when it was finally released by A&M records on an official 12" and CD single, a new version entitled "Bootleggers Response" was included as a b-side. In this version the theme of the song is changed to address the actual bootlegger, accusing him of being forced to make money by bootlegging because he didn't get an education. A sample lyrics: "Are you a person with morals or couth who brushes their teeth in the morning?/Do you even have teeth?/Maybe with the money you made from the bootleg you can go and buy yourself...*A* tooth."
A music video was produced featuring Mystique portraying both herself and the "Miss Thing" subject of the lyrics. It takes place primarily in a classroom setting and parodies several other videos including "Mediate" by INXS and "People Are Still Having Sex" by LaTour.

Afghanistan women's national football team

The Afghanistan women's national football team was formed in 2007 by the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee with players taken from selected school girls in Kabul. That year, the team played for the first time against the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) women's side, which Afghanistan won 5-0. In 2008, the team traveled to Pakistan to participate in the second national tournament of Pakistan. There they won their group stage and semi-final games but lost to Baluchistan in the final.
In an attempt to improve the quality of women's football, the team was sent to Germany in 2008 to hold a preparation camp. Later in the year, the Afghan team traveled to Jordan to participate in the Islamic Countries Women's Football Tournament. However, the results this time were less favourable as they faced established and more experienced teams for the first time. Afghanistan lost all its games by at least 17 goals.(1) 
In February 2009, the team went to Jordan again, but this time for a training camp. The Netherlands' Women's Football Federation has shown interest in helping the team and has invited them for a training camp in Netherlands.
Due to the conditions in Afghanistan and the controversy surrounding the female Muslim football teams, it has been difficult for the Afghanistan Football Federation to obtain long-term sponsorship. In May 2010, Danish sports brand Hummel International signed up the male, female and youth teams of Afghanistan. In October 2010 the team played a friendly match against ISAF on the NATO ground in Kabul. The Afghans won 1-0.
Currently, the Afghan team has 22 members coached by Abdul Saboor Walizada. There are around 25 women's football teams around the country and the Football Federation considers to hold the first national football tournament in the country this year. In December 2010, the team played its first official international game, against Nepal, during the South Asian Football Federation Women's Championships in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. On 16 February 2012 they completed a 2-0 win against Qatar, their first official international victory.

Underwater Demolition Command

The Underwater Demolition Command (), abbreviated as DYK (), until 2002 known as the Underwater Demolition Unit (), abbreviated as MYK (), is the Greek Navy's elite special warfare unit.
History.
Carrying on the tradition of the Hellenic Navy in naval special operations, the unit was established in 1957 with help from the United States Navy's Underwater Demolition Team, when two Greek officers were sent to Little Creek in Virginia to study UDT operations. On their return, they trained a dozen men who formed the nucleus of the MYK cadre. The OYK has been deployed on numerous occasions. It was deployed during the first Gulf War in 1991, providing assistance for the naval embargo against Saddam Hussein, boarding 217 suspect vessels. In 1996, the OYK was involved in the Imia crisis when Turkish commandos infiltrated the island. Small DYK teams infiltrated surrounding islands to observe activities, pending a political solution to the crisis and withdrawal of Turkish forces. In 1997, during the violent unrest that erupted in neighbouring Albania, the OYK were responsible for taking control of the international airport of Tirana and carrying out recovery operations of Greek and other foreign diplomats.
Structure.
The DYK is organised into subsections called "Underwater Demolition Teams" (), commonly known in their abbreviated form as OYK (,), that specialise in a particular area. Each subsection consists of 25 men split into five teams of five.
OYK 1/2: This is the main offensive section of the OYK that specialises in sabotage, raids and maritime counter-terrorism.
OYK 3: This section specialises in reconnaissance. Establishing and reconnoitering beach landing sites prior to a main amphibious assault.
OYK 4: The section specialises in underwater demolition/EOD of obstacles that may prevent an amphibious landing.
OYK 5: This section is a reserve section that is only activated in times of war or serious emergency. It is made up of reservists from the MYK and instructors from the main body.
The selection and training course lasts roughly seven months and is divided into three phases similar to that of the US Navy SEALs BUD/S course. The course has an extremely high failure rate similar to that of its US counterparts. The candidates will go on to airborne school and then continue to learn advanced naval special warfare techniques.

Concretely, if "X" and "Y" are CW-complexes, and "f" : "X" → "Y" is a continuous map, then "f" is said to be "cellular", if "f" takes the "n"-skeleton of "X" to the "n"-skeleton of "Y" for all "n", i.e. if formula_1 for all "n". The content of the cellular approximation theorem is then that any continuous map "f" : "X" → "Y" between CW-complexes "X" and "Y" is homotopic to a cellular map, and if "f" is already cellular on a subcomplex "A" of "X", then we can furthermore choose the homotopy to be stationary on "A". From an algebraic topological viewpoint, any map between CW-complexes can thus be taken to be cellular.
Idea of proof.
The proof can be given by induction after "n", with the statement that "f" is cellular on the skeleton "X""n". For the base case n=0, notice that every path-component of "Y" must contain a 0-cell. The image under "f" of a 0-cell of "X" can thus be connected to a 0-cell of "Y" by a path, but this gives a homotopy from "f" to a map which is cellular on the 0-skeleton of X.
Assume inductively that "f" is cellular on the ("n" − 1)-skeleton of "X", and let "e""n" be an "n"-cell of "X". The closure of "e""n" is compact in "X", being the image of the characteristic map of the cell, and hence the image of the closure of "e""n" under "f" is also compact in "Y". Then it is a general result of CW-complexes that any compact subspace of a CW-complex meets (that is, intersects non-trivially) only finitely many cells of the complex. Thus "f"("e""n") meets at most finitely many cells of "Y", so we can take formula_2 to be a cell of highest dimension meeting "f"("e""n"). If formula_3, the map "f" is already cellular on "e""n", since in this case only cells of the "n"-skeleton of "Y" meets "f"("e""n"), so we may assume that "k" > "n". It is then a technical, non-trivial result (see Hatcher) that the restriction of "f" to formula_4 can be homotoped relative to "X""n-1" to a map missing a point "p" ∈ "e""k". Since "Y""k" − {"p"} deformation retracts onto the subspace "Y""k"-"e""k", we can further homotope the restriction of "f" to formula_4 to a map, say, "g", with the property that "g"("e""n") misses the cell "e""k" of "Y", still relative to "X""n-1". Since "f"("e""n") met only finitely many cells of "Y" to begin with, we can repeat this process finitely many times to make formula_6 miss all cells of "Y" of dimension larger than "n".
We repeat this process for every "n"-cell of "X", fixing cells of the subcomplex "A" on which "f" is already cellular, and we thus obtain a homotopy (relative to the ("n" − 1)-skeleton of "X" and the "n"-cells of "A") of the restriction of "f" to "X""n" to a map cellular on all cells of "X" of dimension at most "n". Using then the homotopy extension property to extend this to a homotopy on all of "X", and patching these homotopies together, will finish the proof. For details, consult Hatcher.
Applications.
Some homotopy groups.
The cellular approximation theorem can be used to immediately calculate some homotopy groups. In particular, if formula_7, then formula_8: Give formula_9 and formula_10 their canonical CW-structure, with one 0-cell each, and with one "n"-cell for formula_9 and one "k"-cell for formula_10. Any base-point preserving map "f":formula_9→formula_10 is by the cellular approximation theorem homotopic to a constant map, whence formula_8.
Cellular approximation for pairs.
Let "f":"(X,A)"→"(Y,B)" be a map of CW-pairs, that is, "f" is a map from "X" to "Y", and the image of formula_16 under "f" sits inside "B". Then "f" is homotopic to a cellular map "(X,A)"→"(Y,B)". To see this, restrict "f" to "A" and use cellular approximation to obtain a homotopy of "f" to a cellular map on "A". Use the homotopy extension property to extend this homotopy to all of "X", and apply cellular approximation again to obtain a map cellular on "X", but without violating the cellular property on "A".
As a consequence, we have that a CW-pair "(X,A)" is n-connected, if all cells of formula_17 have dimension strictly greater than "n": If formula_18, then any map formula_19→"(X,A)" is homotopic to a cellular map of pairs, and since the "n"-skeleton of "X" sits inside "A", any such map is homotopic to a map whose image is in "A", and hence it is 0 in the relative homotopy group formula_20.
We have in particular that formula_21 is "n"-connected, so it follows from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair formula_22 that we have isomorphisms formula_23→formula_24 for all formula_25 and a surjection formula_26→formula_27.

Herbjørn Gausta

Herbjørn Nilson Gaustå also Herbjorn Gausta (June 16, 1854 – May 22, 1924) was an American artist who is best known for his landscapes, portraits and scenes from rural settings. He left an early record of immigrant life in his portraits and paintings and helped establish a place for art in the culture of Norwegian-Americans.
Biography.
Gausta was born on the Gausta farm in Mæl Vestfjorddalen, Telemark, Norway. In 1867, Gausta immigrated to America with his parents and four sisters, settling on a farm near Harmony, Minnesota. Gausta entered a training program for parochial school teachers at Luther College in 1872. He left for Europe three years later on a stipend provided by the community of Decorah, Iowa under the leadership of Ulrik Vilhelm Koren. Gausta studied at Knud Bergslien’s Academy of Art in Oslo and also attended the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.
He returned to Decorah and taught at Luther College during the 1886-1887 academic year. He lived with the U.V. Koren family at the Washington Prairie parsonage while teaching at Luther College. Subsequently, Gausta based his studio in Minneapolis, MN, where he supported himself principally by painting portraits of prominent Norwegian-Americans and producing altarpieces for Lutheran churches. His landscapes and genre paintings were well-received, particularly those painted during his early years. There are almost 60 paintings by Gausta in the Fine Arts Collection of Luther College.
The entertainers Eleonora and Ethel Olson and Gausta were good friends. "Yust For Fun", a book published by the Olson Sisters in 1925, had two illustrations that he may have been drawn. 
Gausta taught at the University of Minnesota until his death in 1924. Gausta, who never married, was buried in Harmony, Minn., alongside a 16-foot granite monument which was erected in his honor in 1927.

High-speed rail in India

India has one of the largest rail networks in the world but does not have any high-speed rail (HSR) lines capable of supporting speeds of or more. High-speed corridors have been proposed but not implemented.
A standardization body will evaluate different options available and provide a common standard to be implemented across India. HSR is still on the drawing board without any official long-term implementation plan for HSR announced, but first railway lines are expected to become operational between 2030 and 2035.
India is currently focusing on high-speed railway track rather than high-speed rail, so that Indian rails can run faster on the current tracks, with a maximum speed at around 160 to 200 km/h; clocking average of 130 km/h.
In the election manifestos for 2014 general election in India, the two major national parties of India, BJP and INC, pledged high-speed rail in the country as part of their manifestos.
The INC had pledged to connect all of India's million-plus cities by high-speed rail, whereas BJP, which won the election, has promised to build the Diamond Quadrilateral project – connecting four major cities of India located in four edges of the country, modelled on the completed Golden Quadrilateral mega highway project. The project was confirmed as a project of priority for the new government in the President's speech.
Current effort to increase speed to 160-200 km/h.
For the first time in the history of Indian Railways, it aims to increase the speed of passenger trains to 160–200 km/h on dedicated conventional tracks.
The railway minister said in 2012 that a combination of prudent investment decisions in the areas of track and bridges, signalling, doubling and train-sets is proposed to be adopted to enable train running at speed of 160 km/h and above. The proposal would significantly reduce travel time for passenger trains by 20-25%. Such infrastructure would also enable Railways to run Shatabdi trains on long distance trunk routes and between metros, he said in his speech.
In February 2014, ET reported quoting Alstom, builder of France's TGV high-speed trains, that India is at least 5–10 years away from high-speed trains. India cannot just jump into the trains with average speed of above 350 kmph, before upgrading the trains to the average speeds from 80 to 120 kmph. Indian trains does not have a good track record in average speed though trains have maximum operating speed of 130-150 kmph. "(It is) extremely important to upgrade the existing infrastructure. You should move from 60 to 70 to 80 (km/hr) and 100 to 120 (km/hr) and then in some corridors (after a few years) you could imagine running bullet trains, " Poupart- Lafarge said in an interview to ET. As of now Increasing the maximum speed of trains to 160-200 kmph(average - 110-120 kmph) have remained part of budget speech, without any long term strategy or operational project has been announced and nothing else has been concretely done.
In July 2014, a trial run of a high speed train with 10 coaches and 2 generators touched the highest speed of 160 kmph between New Delhi and Agra. Railways plan to introduce such trains commercially from November, 2014.
Indian Railways' approach to high-speed is incremental improvement on existing conventional lines for up to 160 km/h, with a forward vision of speed above 200 km/h on new tracks with state-of-the-art technology, such as Shinkansen/TGV/etc. While they do not define high-speed, Indian Railways' approach matches the high-speed definitions of the Trans-European high-speed rail network, for upgraded lines and new lines built for high-speed.
Dedicate tracks on existing trunk lines to passenger trains, by building separate corridors for freight trains, and build separate tracks for busy suburban traffic in Mumbai and other cities where traffic is equally busy. Without slower freight and suburban traffic, fast-express trains can run at the speed limit of rolling stock, the railway track or railroad switch, whichever is lowest among those that apply.
[[File:Indian Railways DFC.png|thumb|Dedicated Freight Corridors
Upgrade the dedicated passenger tracks with heavier rails, and build the tracks to a close tolerance geometry fit for 250–300 km/h. This implied that the high-speed gauge is Indian gauge (broad gauge). High-speed tracks to be maintained and inspected using automation to ensure required track geometry. Perform more frequent inspection to ensure high confidence of safety at high-speed.
Design, manufacture and deploy railroad switches, with thick web construction and movable crossings that permit 50 km/h to alleviate this bottleneck to speed.
Improve coaches, which can support 160 km/h, with stainless steel bodies and crash-worthy designs, incorporating passenger and crew protection, and fire-retardant materials. Equip coaches with electro-pneumatic brake systems to enhance safe operations at 160–200 km/h.
Develop locomotives with output of 9000 to 12000 hp for hauling of 24-26 coach long passenger trains to 160–200 km/h.
Indian railways has asked IIT Kharagpur to conduct research to obtain the technological knowhow to increase the maximum attainable speed to 200 km/h. The project, which will be conducted in the Railway Research Centre of IIT Kharagpur, has four main goals; improving speed, improving carrying capacity (heavy haul), use of advanced material, advanced signalling and maintenance for better safety. The research is expected to be completed by the end of 2015.
Current Systems.
The following table shows status semi high speed rail in India. A trail run has been successfully completed on Delhi - Agra section and plans are to start these trains on Delhi - Bhopal / Chandigarh / Kanpur / Lucknow sections after starting on Delhi - Agra section.

Proposal to introduce 300-350 km/h trains.
History.
One of the first proposals to introduce high-speed trains in India was mooted in the mid-1980s by then Railway Minister Madhavrao Scindia. A high-speed rail line between Delhi and Kanpur via Agra was proposed. An internal study found the proposal not to be viable at that time due to the high cost of construction and inability of travelling passengers to bear much higher fares than those for normal trains. The railways instead introduced Shatabdi trains which ran at 130 km/h.
The Indian Ministry of Railways' white-paper "Vision 2020", submitted to Indian Parliament on December 18, 2009, envisages the implementation of regional high-speed rail projects to provide services at 250–350 km/h, and planning for corridors connecting commercial, tourist and pilgrimage hubs. Six corridors have already been identified for technical studies on setting-up of high-speed rail corridors: Delhi–Chandigarh–Amritsar, Pune-Mumbai-Ahmedabad, Hyderabad-Kazipet-Dornakal-Vijayawada-Chennai, Howrah–Haldia, Chennai-Bangalore-Coimbatore-Ernakulam-Thiruvananthapuram, Delhi-Agra-Lucknow-Varanasi-Patna. These high-speed rail corridors will be built as elevated corridors in keeping with the pattern of habitation and the constraint of land.
Indian Railway set up a corporation called High Speed Rail Corporation of India Ltd (HSRC) on 25 July 2012, that will exclusively deal with the proposed high-speed rail corridor projects. The corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. (RVNL), a special purpose vehicle that carries out the construction works for Indian Railways. It will handle tendering, pre-feasibility studies, awarding contracts and execution of the projects. The corporation will comprise four members, all of whom will be railway officials. All high-speed rail lines will be implemented through PPP mode on a Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) basis. The corporation was officially formed on 29 October 2013. The HSRC will co-exist with the High-Speed Rail Authority of India (HSRA). The latter will determine the framework and the scope of works needed for India's high-speed railway plans, while the former will execute these decisions.
Indian government has not taken any decision on building the High Speed Rail in India. India is still guarded in its view on HSR - "India will plan such projects based on its infrastructure priorities, commercial viability and financial resources in India". But it is expected that by 2030-2035 India will have its first HSR line ready, if not operational. The joint feasibility study for Mumbai-Ahmedabad route should be completed by July 2015, if approved it will result in financial closure, land acquisition and resulting court cases, planning, engineering and construction.

Routes.
In India, trains in the future with top speeds of 300–350 km/h, are envisaged to run on elevated corridors, to prevent trespassing by animals and people. This is an excellent way to isolate high-speed train tracks. The TGV tracks are completely fenced in and has no road crossing them at the same level. Wu-Guang’s 2-tracks line is laid, 468 km on bridges, 177 km in tunnels, and 323 km on embankments. The 336 km THSR tracks are 91% on bridges, flyover, or tunnels.
The current conventional lines between Amritsar-New Delhi, and Ahmedabad-Mumbai runs through suburban and rural areas, which are flat, therefore have no tunnel. Ahmedabad-Mumbai line runs near the coast therefore have more bridges, and parts of it are in backwaters or forest. The 1987 RDSO/JICA feasibility study found the Mumbai-Ahmedabad line as most promising.
Maharashtra state government has proposed a link between Mumbai and Nagpur which will be good for development of the state railway. This project's cost is estimated 60,000 crore. The government also wants a corridor which will connect to Navi Mumbai International Airport.

Project execution.
A separate entity, High Speed Rail Authority of India (HSRA), has been set up to operationalise bullet trains in the country as part of 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17).
To put the construction in perspective, in the period 2005-09 Indian Railways took on construction of 42 completely new conventional lines, a total of 4060 km at a cost of Rs 167 billion (US$ 3.63 billion), or Rs 41 million per km (US$ 0.89 million/km). A public-private-partnership mode of investment and execution is envisaged for such expensive 250–350 km/h high-speed rail project.
Feasibility studies.
Multiple pre-feasibility and feasibility studies have been done or in progress.
The consultants for pre-feasibility study for four corridors are:
During the 2012 Rail Budget speech, Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi announced that pre-feasibility studies on the Ahmedabad-Mumbai-Pune, Delhi-Agra-Lucknow-Varanasi-Patna, Howrah-Haldia, Hyderabad-Dornakal-Vijaywada-Chennai and the Chennai-Bangalore-Coimbatore-Ernakulam-Thiruvananthapuram high-speed corridors have already been completed and study on Delhi-Jaipur-Ajmer-Jodhpur route will be taken up in 2012-13. In February 2013, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi demanded railway ministry for speedy implementation of pending Highspeed Rail projects in the country.
In September 2013, an agreement was signed in New Delhi to complete a feasibility study of High Speed Rail between Ahmedabad and Mumbai, within 18 months. and the cost will be shared 50:50 by Japan and India.
High Speed Rail Corporation has called for international bidders for carrying out the pre-feasibility study of the 450-km Delhi - Chandigarh - Amritsar High Speed Corridor.
Non-standardisation of high-speed rail infrastructure.
India has not standardized the infrastructure for high-speed rail projects to be executed across India. This has resulted in different projects using different gauges for their lines. Delay in standardisation may result in using inefficient use of High-Speed route for freight transport, as the both standard railway and high-speed railway using different kind of gauges. Delay in creating a standardisation for High-Speed railway in India may result in a project like Project Unigauge, which may be necessary as control of PPP projects are given back to the Indian Railway by concessioner after the concession period.
Standardisation will make Indian Railways more efficient, avoid the current break of gauges, increase the freight-carrying capacity and shorten the routes with many re-gauged links. It will also standardise the manufacturing of Railway components across India, thus bringing cost of manufacturing of the indigenous railway related components.
Using a Broad gauge is expected to bring down the cost of transporting freight from one place to another and necessary to keep trains stable in the face of strong monsoon winds. Broad gauge allows bigger trains, higher speeds, and more stability. The con is cost, it costs more than smaller gauge.
Broad gauge offers an advantage to freight movement, as trains in India can carry standard shipping containers double-stacked on standard flatcars, which is more economical than single containers. In contrast, standard-gauge railways in North American and elsewhere must use special double-stack cars to lower the center of gravity and reduce the loading gauge requirements.
Metro projects in India, like Delhi Metro (some lines), Bangalore Metro, Kochi Metro used the standard gauge. But, recent studies by international consultants have shown using Broad gauge is better suited for Indian high population density. Broad gauge provides more seating space and a better option for long term feasibility of railway projects.
Fragmentation of the High-Speed Rail Network.
There are 2 kinds of fragmentation which can seen in the High-Speed Rail Network in India. There is no single government agency which will own the stretch, there is also different gauges used by different projects and India has not defined a its own standard for its HSR(like China) using which it can bring in competition among the bidders and induce technology transfers.
In India, National Highways are being developed under BOOT (Build, Own, Operate and Transfer) basis. NHAI is the sole authority which will have the control of all the National Highways at end of concession period. But, High-Speed Rail Network development in India is fragmented. There will not be end to end ownership or leasing out of the HSR in India. So, there can be no single Indian Government agency owning the complete HSR network in India.
Unlike NHDP, where the National Highways will come under the direct ownership of the Central agency National Highway Authority of India, after the end of concession period, High-Speed Rail development is still driven by multiple independent companies. This means high-speed railway infrastructure will remain fragmented across India, without any company controlling end to end Railway line from East to West or North to South, for unforeseeable future.
For example, alongside Arabian Sea coast, Kerala High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd. (KHSRC) is driving a Standard gauge high-speed rail, where as Indian Railway is working on Broad gauge, for Ahmedabad-Mumbai corridor.
Speed of trains.
High-speed railway projects are still in planning stage and when the HSR is constructed and becomes operational, the best available technology of that time will be adopted (around year 2030-2035). Adopting high-speed trains will reduce the fuel consumption of the country, reduce "time cost", provide major boost to manufacturing, services and the agriculture sectors, save foreign exchange by transporting large amounts of people and goods in a shorter time using less-inflationary electrical power instead of imported fossil fuels. India is mainly working with Japan and France for the High Speed Trains.
In 1969, The Rajdhani Express was introduced with speeds up to 140 km/h, a great achievement at the time. The top speed has remained almost the same for 45 years.
As of Interim Railway Budget 2014-15, no long term strategic and concrete policy measures have been taken regarding trains above the average speed of 70–90 km/h(Shatabdi, Rajdhani and Duronto) trains.
As of 2014, Indian Railway network does not provide any significant benefit over the road transport. Railway infrastructure is unable to compete with the accessibility, last mile connectivity and door-to-door travel time of 120 km/h designed expressways.
Looking at current speed of implementation in DFC and other railway projects, first line of High-speed train may become operational by 2030 - 2035, and the subsequent lines becoming operational between 2030 - 2060 timeframe. This can happen only if government commits enough resources for the implementation of the same, as economic and manufacturing stimulation package. As of 2014, high-speed rail is still in consultation and discussion stage.
High-speed freight train.
Optimal use of the high-speed railway network and for the economic development of the country, it is expected that freight trains will use the high-speed network.
HSR network cannot break-even with just the passenger traffic. Freight trains needs to run on this lines to make them profitable. It may be a Road-rail synergy system or a container traffic. Freight trains result in efficient use of the tracks especially in the night time. JIT and reduction of the inventory is possible with HSR freight trains and overall productivity improvement. However, a Scandinavian plan about HSR between Oslo and Copenhagen reports that costs of high-speed lines with freight-train capability is significantly higher than pure high-speed lines.
Diamond Quadrilateral project.
Introducing the 'Diamond Quadrilateral' high speed network connecting the four major cities of India located in four edges of the country was a key plank in the BJP's election manifesto, and the BJP Government has shown interest in implementing the project. After winning the elections, prior to taking office, three top officials from Indian Railways were instructed by then PM-designate, Narendra Modi to carry out a reconnaissance mission with France's state rail operator, SNCF (which operates the TGV high speed rail system). In his address to the joint session of the Parliament, on 9 June 2014, the President of India, officially mentioned about the policy of the new Government led by Narendra Modi to launch a Diamond Quadrilateral project of high speed trains.
Legal.
No new act of parliament or parliament-approved policy measures has been planned for the high-speed railway in India. It is expected that Railways Act, 1989 along with Ministry of Railway will be guiding the implementation of the high-speed railway in India.
R&D institutions.

Nelson Munsey

Nelson Emory Munsey (July 2, 1948 – July 8, 2009) was an American football cornerback in the National Football League. He was signed by the Baltimore Colts as an undrafted free agent in 1972. He played college football at Wyoming.
He was the older brother of Chuck Muncie who also played in the NFL for the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers.
Early years.
After he starred as a running back at Uniontown Area High School in his hometown, Munsey switched to defensive back when he played at the University of Wyoming.
Professional career.
Munsey had two touchdowns, seven interceptions and five fumble recoveries in 72 games with the Colts, all at right cornerback. His first touchdown was scored in his rookie year on a three-yard fumble recovery return in the first quarter of a 24–21 road loss to the San Francisco 49ers on November 12, 1972. His other one came in the fourth quarter on December 21, 1975 when he intercepted a Steve Grogan pass and returned it thirty yards to clinch a regular-season-ending 34–21 home victory over the New England Patriots and the first of three consecutive American Football Conference (AFC) Eastern Division championships for the Colts.
The 1975 season was the only one in his career in which Munsey started all the games played by the Colts. His last start of that campaign was a 28–10 road loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC semifinals on December 27, 1975. The last NFL contest Munsey played was another conference semifinal match two years later on December 24, 1977 when the Colts lost to the Oakland Raiders 37–31 in double overtime at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. On the game's deciding play, Dave Casper ran past Munsey to catch his third touchdown of the contest.

<doc id="21537440" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21537440" title="Joseph Summers">
Joseph Summers

Captain Joseph "Mutt" Summers, (10 March 1904 – 16 March 1954), was chief test pilot at Vickers-Armstrongs and Supermarine.
During his career Summers flew numerous prototype aircraft first flights, (a record of 54 by a test pilot), from the Supermarine Spitfire, to the Vickers Valiant. He also holds the current second place record for 366 general types tested, below Eric "Winkle" Brown's 487.
Summers also holds the highest number of flying hours of any test pilot in the world; he clocked up over 5,600 flying hours. He also flew over 300 different types of aeroplane.
Career.
Captain Joseph "Mutt" Summers received his nickname "Mutt" during his early days in the RAF from his habit of urinating before take off on the small rear wheel or skid of the aircraft he was testing. This led to his being accused of christening his aircraft like a dog marking its territory. He did this because he was aware that during some crashes a full bladder could prove fatal.
Summers was granted a short-service commission in the RAF at the age of 21, and learned to fly on Avro 504s and Sopwith Snipes at No. 2 F.T.S. (Flying Training School). He passed out from RAF Digby in 1924 and was posted to No. 29 Fighter Squadron, equipped with Snipes and later with Gloster Grebes.
After six months he was transferred to the single-seater flight at Martlesham Heath, where he helped to test, among other types, the Gloster Gamecock, Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Hornbill and Avro Avenger. He flew for five years at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Martlesham Heath, including periods on loan to Blackburn Aircraft and Avro. He left his post at Martlesham in May, 1929, and the following month joined Vickers Aviation Ltd, as their chief test pilot. A year later he became chief test pilot to the Supermarine Aviation Works and in that capacity flew the first Supermarine Spitfire in 1936.
Summers tested numerous fighters and bombers through the 1930s. He flew the prototype of Barnes Wallis's geodetic aircraft the Vickers Wellesley bomber in June 1935. He was landing this aircraft on 23 July when the port undercarriage collapsed, resulting in several months in the workshops to repair the serious damage to the wing.
He flew the protoytpe Wellington Bomber, K4049, with Wallis and Westbrook (factory manager) aboard, at Brooklands on 15 June 1936. It was to have been called the Crecy, but the change to Wellington (to commemorate the Iron Duke), started the practice of using the initial letter W for Vickers aircraft that employed Barnes Wallis geodetic structures.
Through the late 1930s and into the 1940s Summers continued to test numerous aircraft and iron out issues with existing airframes.
K5054 prototype Supermarine Spitfire.
On 5 March 1936 Jeffrey Quill flew Summers in a Vickers' Miles Falcon from Martlesham to Eastleigh Aerodrome, where he was to fly the new F.37/34 fighter, which on arrival had been changed to K5054.
Summers (then chief test pilot for Vickers (Aviation) Ltd.) took the prototype K5054 on its first flight from Eastleigh Aerodrome (later Southampton Airport). After an eight-minute flight, Summers landed the prototype.
K5054 was fitted with a new propeller and Summers flew the aircraft again on 10 March; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire was a very good aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just , a little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hawker Hurricane.
A new and better-shaped wooden propeller meant the Spitfire reached in level flight in mid-May, then Summers flew the K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE).
Second World War.
Shortly before the Second World War, Summers was succeeded by Jeffrey Quill, his assistant and protégé, who took over testing single-seater prototypes during the war.
During this period of the war, all leading test pilots of the main aircraft manufacturers were ordered by RAF Command to support Groups No. 10, 11, 12 and 13. Most test pilots came from Brooklands where the central manufacture and testing of military aircraft took place. Summers became a supervising RAF fighter tester specifically for No. 11 Group RAF, commanded by Air Vice Marshal Keith Park, during the Battle of Britain. Being a test pilot in this capacity and a former RAF officer, Summers' duty was as a "home guard" non-combatant position.
During the summer of 1940 Summers was to fly between all No. 11 Group's airfields in south east England to test fighter aircraft and ensure all they were safe to be used by 11 Group pilots after each battle. Any problems were reported to each airfield's maintenance crews. Also pilots were issued requisition tickets for a new aircraft if Summers found an aircraft to be unserviceable.
Propeller failures.
During mid-1940, Jeffrey Quill informed Summers about a problem with propeller fatigue on early versions of the Mk1 Hurricane and Spitfire. The problem could lead to the propeller detaching itself during flight—something Quill had experienced himself.
Early in the Battle of Britain during an attack over south east England, pilot James Harry "Ginger" Lacey of 501 Squadron from RAF Middle Wallop, complained he had a problem with his Hurricane's engine, and felt it was too dangerous to accelerate any faster than he was.
After Lacey landed the Hurricane, Summers took it up on a five-minute test flight. At Summers noticed a problem with the engine when accelerating to a certain speed. Whilst at full throttle, the propeller sheared off the aircraft. The prop ripped off the cowling and as Summers had no parachute with him it was necessary to glide the plane back to the air field.
The Bouncing Bomb.
In preparation for the Dambusters Raid in May 1943, Summers was test pilot for the experimental bouncing bomb dropped from a Vickers Wellington near Portland, Dorset, a job given to him by close friend Barnes Wallis. He was depicted by Patrick Barr in the film made of the events.
Postwar career.
Summer's flew Britain’s first postwar airliner the Vickers VC.1 Viking, adapted from the Wellington bomber, on 22 June 1945. This was followed by the military troop transport the Vickers Valetta, which Summers flew on 30 June 1947 at Brooklands.
The prototype of the turboprop civil transport Vickers Viscount was flown from Wisley Airfield by Summers and Jock Bryce for 10 minutes on 16 July 1948.
The very last prototype to have Summers at the controls on its maiden flight was the Vickers Valiant, once again with Jock Bryce as co-pilot, flown from Wisley Airfield on 18 May 1951.
Accidents.
Summers experienced a number of accidents and crashes during his career. During a test flight on the first dual Gloster Grebe, the aircraft spun flat to within of the ground, coming out completely stalled with full engine. In a terminal velocity dive in the Hawker Hawfinch, a fuselage bay collapsed at about t.v. speed; the anchorage for the Sutton harness was in the tail and this pulled him back and nearly broke his neck. While testing the first Bulldog Summers spun down from , having tried to abandon the machine at . He had released his harness and was on the centre section when the machine stopped rotating and went into a dive, enabling him to regain control by pushing the stick with his foot. Thereupon he climbed back into the cockpit and landed.
His most dramatic escape was in 1945, when structural failure in a Vickers Warwick applied full rudder at over Weybridge, Surrey. Summers had no alternative but to crash land the aircraft into an avenue of trees, with a ploughed field at the end. When the aircraft had come to rest flames emerged from both engine air intakes. Fortunately, some farm labourers had time to get into the fuselage and extricate Summers and his flight engineer before a major fire started.
Records.
What made him the best at what he was, and why he was predominantly chosen above other test pilots, was his unique ability to identify issues with any aircraft just by sitting the cockpit and listening to the sound the aircraft made in flight.
In his career he clocked up over 5,600 flying hours, which is the equivalent of taking off in an aircraft on 1 January and landing at the end of October. This is the highest amount of flying hours currently achieved by any test pilot. By 1946 he had tested 310 different aircraft.
Summers numbered among his firsts the first flight of a pure jet civil aircraft (the Nene-Viking) on 6 April 1948, the first flight of civil turboprop airliner (the Vickers Viscount) on 16 July 1948 and the initial flight of Britain's first four-jet bomber (Vickers Valiant) on 18 May 1951.
By the time he retired he had achieved 366 general types, second only to the Guinness world record holder Eric "Winkle" Brown who has 487. Summers still holds the world record of 54 "Prototype First Flights".
Personal life.
Summers married Dulcie Jeanette Belcher in 1922 in Sculcoates, Yorkshire. He had a daughter, Josephine Ann Summers, born in 1931.
Summers died on 16 March 1954 from complications during colon surgery, six days after his 50th birthday. He was buried in Weybridge Cemetery, Surrey after a ceremony in Westminster Abbey.
Portrayal in Film.
In the 1955 film, "The Dam Busters", Summers was portrayed by the actor Patrick Barr.

Rare Disease Day

Rare Disease Day is an observance held on the last day of February to raise awareness for rare diseases and improve access to treatment and medical representation for individuals with rare diseases and their families. It was established in 2008 because, according to the European Organization for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS), treatment for many rare diseases is insufficient, as are the social networks to support individuals with rare diseases and their families; furthermore, while there were already numerous days dedicated to sufferers of individual diseases (such as AIDS, cancer, etc.), there had previously not been a day for representing sufferers of rare diseases. In 2009 Rare Disease Day went global as NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders) mobilized 200 rare disease patient advocacy organizations in the United States while organizations in China, Australia, Taiwan, and Latin America also lead efforts in their respective countries to coordinate activities and promote the day. In addition, leading rare disease patient advocacy organizations including the Global Genes Project have joined forces to promote Rare Disease Day.
2008.
The first Rare Disease Day was held on 29 February 2008 in numerous European nations and in Canada through the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders, organized by EURORDIS. The date was chosen because February 29 is a "rare day," and 2008 was the 25th anniversary of the passing of the Orphan Drug Act in the United States. Individuals observing Rare Disease Day took part in walks and press conferences to raise public awareness of rare diseases, organized fundraisers, and wrote en masse to government representatives; health-related non-profit organizations across numerous countries also held events, gatherings, and campaigns. The day also included an open session of the European Parliament specifically dedicated to discussing policy issues relating to rare diseases. The days leading up to Rare Disease Day included other policy-related events in numerous locations, such as a reception in the British Parliament where policymakers met with individuals with rare diseases to discuss issues such as "equal access and availability of prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation."
2009.
Rare Disease Day was observed for the first time in Panama, Colombia, Argentina, Australia, the People's Republic of China, and the United States.
In the United States NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders) signed on to coordinate Rare Disease Day on February 28 and collaborated with media partner The Discovery Channel and program partner "Mystery Diagnosis", as well about 180 other partners, to organize activities across the country for the observance of Rare Disease Day. Several United States state governments issued proclamations regarding Rare Disease Day.
In Europe, over 600 patient advocacy and support organizations, again coordinated by EURORDIS, also planned events.
2010.
Rare Disease Day 2010 was observed on Sunday February 28. The theme for Rare Disease Day 2010 was "Patients and Researchers: Partners for Life".
The event saw the participation of a total of 46 countries participated in 2010. Newcomers from Eastern Europe were Latvia, Lithuania Slovenia and Georgia. 3 African countries joined the event as well.
2011.
Rare Disease Day 2011 took place on February 28. Theme for 2011 was "Rare Diseases and Health Inequalities", to focus on differences for rare disease patients between and within countries, and compared to other segments of society, in order to ensure equal access for patients to health care, social services and rights, and to orphan drugs and treatments. 
The following countries participated in Rare Disease Day in 2011:
2012.
Rare Disease Day 2012 is the fifth to be observed and since 2012 is a leap year, this is the second time the day falls on the originally intended date (February 29, a Wednesday). Each year, the global planning committee, under the leadership of EURORDIS and with NORD as the US representative, selects a theme to be used around the world. For 2012, the theme is "Solidarity" and the slogan is "Rare But Strong Together". Other members of the global planning committee include representatives from the national rare disease alliances in several European countries. Thousands of patient advocacy organizations have gotten involved, including more than 600 partners working with NORD in the US to promote Rare Disease Day.

Riverine artillery

Riverine artillery refers to artillery employment on a river, generally on floating barges. Transport of field artillery is difficult through the moist ground and riparian forest adjacent to low-gradient rivers. Traditional naval artillery is mounted on deep-draft vessels unsuited for operations in shallow rivers.
Vietnam War.
France developed the "Dinassaut" (assault river division) concept early in their effort to fight communist guerrillas in French Indochina. The value of artillery was demonstrated by French ships when coastal Mon Cay became the only French garrison along the Chinese border to survive a 1950 Viet Minh offensive.
During the Vietnam War, the United States employed riverine artillery due to the difficulty of transporting and emplacing artillery pieces in marshy areas. The formation of a riverine task force (composed of 2d Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division and the U.S. Navy River Assault Flotilla 1) increased the importance of artillery support in riverine areas, and fixed locations near river areas proved unsatisfactory. In December 1966, 1st Battalion, 7th Artillery positioned M101A1 105mm howitzers aboard LCM-6 landing craft, with the intent that the craft be towed to a supported area and moored to a riverbank.
Later, it was established that the LCM-6 was too small to serve effectively, and howitzers were positioned on Navy AMMI pontoon barges. When these proved to difficult to move and to have too deep of a draft, barges formed of Navy P-1 pontoons were the workable solution. M101A1, and later M102 howitzers were mounted onto a baseplate welded to the barge deck, allowing the howitzer to be traversed 360 degrees.
A complete battery of riverine 105mm artillery consisted of three howitzer barges, and five LCM-8s for support staff such as the Fire Direction Center.

Pinoline

Pinoline is a methoxylated tryptoline (5-methoxytryptoline) that is produced in the pineal gland during the metabolism of melatonin. Its IUPAC name is 6-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline, usually abbreviated as 6-MeO-THBC, and its more common name is a combination of "pineal beta-carboline". The biological activity of this molecule is of interest as a potential free radical scavenger, also known as an antioxidant, and as a monoamine oxidase A inhibitor.
Bausch & Lomb filed a patent for this molecule as a potential drug delivery device to treat various ophthalmic disorders in 2006.
Protection of cellular membranes.
Aluminium toxicity causes an increase in lipid peroxidation, with most damage occurring in the brain. A recent review of studies shows pinoline and melatonin to be effective at reducing the lipid peroxidation. Studies included both human and animal subjects. The studies’ results support that pinoline has antioxidant properties.
Lipopolysaccharide is produced by Gram-negative bacteria and stimulates the production of free radicals which in turn cause lipid peroxidation. A recent study compared the effectiveness of melatonin and other similar compounds on the lipopolysaccharide induced lipid peroxidation. The results showed support for pinoline’s ability to reduce damage from lipid peroxidation. Pinoline was also shown to be more effective than vitamin E at reducing lipopolysaccharide activity in the retina.
Another recent study compared the antioxidant properties of compounds from the tryptophan metabolic pathway in the pineal gland against oxidative damage to the lipids and proteins of synaptosomes. Synaptosomes isolated from rat brains were used in an experiment assessing damage by measuring malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxyalkenal, and carbonyl content in the proteins. Pinoline was shown to be the most powerful antioxidant. These results support the evidence for pinoline’s antioxidant abilities and the potential to protect against oxidative damage.

The temple.
Lord Brahma is the prominent lord god of the Hindu triad. The other two are Vishnu and Mahesh. Brahma is the lord of creation. There is one temple of Brahma at Pushkar. The other is here. The yellow (golden stone) of Jaisalmer has been used in the construction of main entrance hall. The rest of the temple is made of Jodhpur Stone (Chhitar Stone). The idol of Shri Brahma ji is made of Marble. The carving work however is unique. The foundation of the temple was laid on 20 April 1961 but the deity was enthroned on 6 May 1984. The chief deity is lord Brahma, his consort Gayatri's idol is also by the side of the chief deity. The idol is indeed unique piece of sculptural elegance. There are idols of various vedic sages Maharishi Uddalak, Maharishi Vashishta, Maharishi Kashyap, Maharishi Gautam, Maharishi Pippalada, Maharishi Parashara and Maharishi Bhardwaj. Rajpurohit brahmins trace their vedic lineage from these sages.
The temple has been built mainly by the Rajpurohit community. A big condoned off place is there for birds to pick up grain. Every day 200 Kilogram of grain is fed to birds. The vast lodge can house hundreds of visitors in its 102 rooms and 11 halls. Charges are very nominal. The present Mahant (Manager priest) Sant Tulsaram ji Maharaj is doing a commendable job in propagating the message of love and peace along with heading various programs for social welfare. An education institution, in the name of Sant Khetaram ji Maharaj is being run. A higher secondary school is also proposed. Free charitable preparation of food is performed every day which is served to visitors and devotees much like the langar pratha common among Sikhs. A well managed kine house (gaushala) houses 350 cows. Gau-seva has as a prime importance in the vedic sanatana dharma.
Sant Khetaramji/Kheteshwar ji Maharaj.
Sant Khetaramji/Kheteshwar ji Maharaj was a true saint by means of dharma and karma. He was a divine soul who had followers cutting across all castes and creeds. He revitalized the importance of spiritual means to achieve self-realization and emphasizing humanity above all other man made barriers like casteism etc. The divine being laid down his fleshy tabernacle on May 6, 1984 and left for heavenly abode after inaugurating the Lord Brahma Temple on May 5, 1984 i.e. after establishing the idol of Brahmaji. His disciples and his community members- Rajpurohits overwhelmed with emotions then built a vast and beautiful temple dedicated to the late saint in the near vicinity of the Brahma mandir housing a lifesize idol of the saint. Makrana marble has been used for erecting the cenotaph of Sant Shri Kheteshwar ji Maharaj.
The place has now developed as a major tourist attraction of the region pulling thousands of tourists and devotees each year. Every year on 5th day of the bright half of Vaisakh month (May) the Pran-Prathishta ceremony is commemorated. On the next day, the death anniversary of Sant Kheteshwar ji Maharaj (the founder of the temple) is observed. Other major festivals celebrated here are - Mahashivratri and Guru Poornima.

Rolando McClain

Rolando Marquise McClain (born July 14, 1989) is an American football linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Alabama, where he was recognized as a unanimous All-American and the best college linebacker in the nation, and helped Alabama win the 2010 BCS National Championship. Drafted eighth overall by the Oakland Raiders in 2010, McClain played three seasons in the NFL, leading the Raiders in tackles in 2011. After various off-the-field incidents, however, he was cut by the Raiders in April 2013. Signed to one-year contract with the Baltimore Ravens, he claimed to have retired from football in May 2013 at the age of 23. However, in July 2014, the Dallas Cowboys traded a 6th round draft pick in exchange for the technically retired McClain and a 7th round pick.
High school career.
McClain attended Decatur High School in Decatur, Alabama, where he played linebacker and tight end for the Decatur Red Raiders high school football team. As a senior he was an "Orlando Sentinel" All-Southern team selection, Parade All-American, and was selected to play in the first Offense-Defense All-American Bowl in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In high school, he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, though recent tests seemed to indicate that was a misdiagnosis.
College career.
McClain accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Alabama, where he played for coach Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 2007 to 2009.
As a true freshman in 2007, he started 8 of 13 games for the Crimson Tide, finishing fourth on the team in tackles with 75. He also recorded two interceptions and a sack and was a freshmen All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection.
During his sophomore season in 2008, McClain compiled 95 tackles, three sacks, and an interception, earning Associated Press (AP) third-team All-American honors, and was a first-team All-SEC selection.
For the 2009 season, McClain had 105 total tackles including 14.5 tackles for loss. He also had four sacks, fourteen quarterback hurries, two interceptions, three passes broken up, and a forced fumble. He was named Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) National Defensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Kentucky Wildcats in early October. Following the SEC Championship Game, Rolando was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year, and a first-team All-SEC selection.
On December 7, 2009, McClain was announced as the winner of the 2009 Lambert Award for the best collegiate linebacker. He is the first Alabama linebacker to win the Lambert Award since its inception in 1991. A day later, he was also awarded the 2009 Dick Butkus Award, being only the second Crimson Tide player to do so (along with Derrick Thomas in 1988). He was recognized a unanimous first-team All-American, after being named to the first teams of the American Football Coaches Association, Associated Press, Football Writers Association of America, "Sporting News", and Walter Camp Football Foundation.
On January 11, 2010, several days after winning the BCS National Championship, McClain decided to forgo his senior year at Alabama and enter the NFL draft.
Professional career.
2010 NFL Draft.
McClain was selected by the Oakland Raiders with the eighth overall pick in the first round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was the highest drafted Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker since Keith McCants went 4th overall to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 1990 NFL Draft.
Oakland Raiders.
McClain signed his contract with the Raiders on July 28, 2010, in time to make the first day of training camp. The contract is estimated to be for $40 million over 5 years.
In week 2 of the 2010 season against the St. Louis Rams, McClain body slammed Danny Amendola, which drew an "unnecessary roughness" call and eventually a $5,000 fine by the NFL. He recorded his first career sack in week 7 against Kyle Orton of the Denver Broncos and his first career interception in week 12 against Chad Henne of the Miami Dolphins.
McClain finished his first season with 85 tackles, 0.5 sacks, an interception, and 6 passes defended.
During the 2012 NFL season, in which the Raiders' defense struggled and was statistically the worst defense in the league, McClain saw his playing time decrease following a 37-6 rout by the division rival Denver Broncos. During a week 4 game against Denver, McClain played in 73 snaps, but following the bye, the Raiders made the decision to replace him with 4th round rookie Miles Burris in their nickel package, resulting in McClain playing only 17 snaps compared to Burris' 55 in the week 6 game against the Atlanta Falcons. Head coach Dennis Allen was quoted as saying that he has been impressed with Burris' ability to make corrections on the fly, saying the linebacker was not a "repeat offender" when it came to mistakes and a smart football player overall, indicating the coaching staff's belief that McClain was guilty of poor decision-making and too many errors.
According to sources within the Raiders, it was reported by NFL.com's Albert Breer and Ian Rapoport that McClain had been kicked out of an official team practice session on November 29 due to an "incident". McClain then took to social media outlet Facebook and released a series of comments stating that he was ". . .no longer an Oakland Raider!!" and that he was ". . .mentally done." with the team, wishing ". . .to be anywhere besides here".
McClain had been drafted with the hopes that he could help improve the Raiders' run defense, an area where the team had been consistently among the worst in the league. Following a string of poor first round picks by late owner/GM Al Davis, the selection of Rolando McClain was applauded by many analysts. Throughout his tenure however, McClain has not only failed to help bolster the defense against the run, but he has also shown to be a liability in pass coverage.
McClain was released on April 5, 2013 by the Oakland Raiders.
Baltimore Ravens.
McClain signed with the Baltimore Ravens on April 10, 2013. On May 15, 2013 McClain announced his retirement. McClain never played for the Ravens due to his retirement.
Dallas Cowboys.
On July 1, 2014, the Dallas Cowboys acquired McClain and a seventh round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft from the Ravens in exchange for a sixth round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft.
Personal.
McClain was born in Decatur, Alabama to parents Roland McClain and Tonya Malone. He grew up in the projects of Decatur, Alabama. At 15, Rolando received a restraining order against his mother after she beat him and threatened him with a knife. At 16, she was arrested after she threatened his entire high school which resulted in a school lock down. During the trial she was diagnosed as bi-polar. His estranged father was granted custody but McClain left to return to Decatur to stay eligible for football. He lived with several families including the Tim Thomas family his junior year. Tim played on the same Ole Miss basketball team as Sean Tuohy, whose Memphis family took in Michael Oher, which is the subject of the book and movie "The Blind Side". McClain could be considered to have been "on his own" since he was 15.
McClain's cousin Le'Ron McClain also played football at the University of Alabama, and as of 2014 he plays for the San Diego Chargers.
In January 2013, McClain married Capri Knox and, with their 2 sons, moved to Madison, Alabama. McClain and Knox first met in 2007 at the University of Alabama where she was a member of the Alabama Track team.
After his retirement, McClain moved to Tuscaloosa, where he re-enrolled at the University of Alabama in order to finish his bachelor's degree in family financial planning.
Arrests.
On December 1, 2011, McClain was arrested by Decatur police and charged with third-degree assault, menacing, reckless endangerment and discharging a firearm inside the city limits, all of which are misdemeanors, for a shooting incident that occurred the night before. On May 17, 2012, McClain was found guilty on all counts, ordered to pay a $500 fine for each charge, totaling $2,000, and sentenced to spend 45 days in jail for each charge, 180 in total. He was freed on bond, and will begin serving his sentence on June 1.
On November 18, 2012, while the case was on appeal, the charges were dismissed by the Judge after the victim decided not to press charges. According to lawyers involved, a financial settlement was reached between McClain and the victim.
On January 8, 2013 McClain was arrested by Decatur Police in Morgan County after an officer pulled him over for a window tint violation. McClain provided the officer with a false name and he was arrested and booked into the Decatur City Jail. McClain bonded out of jail later that day.
On April 21, 2013, McClain was arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.

Chavakachcheri Electoral District

Chavakachcheri Electoral District was an electoral district of Sri Lanka between August 1947 and February 1989. The district was named after the town of Chavakachcheri in Jaffna District, Northern Province. Kilinochchi Electoral District was carved out of the southern part of the district in March 1960. The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka introduced the proportional representation electoral system for electing members of Parliament. The existing 160 mainly single-member electoral districts were replaced with 22 multi-member electoral districts. Chavakachcheri electoral district was replaced by the Jaffna multi-member electoral district at the 1989 general elections, the first under the PR system, though Chavakachcheri continues to be a polling division of the multi-member electoral district.

Waya

Waya (1974–2001) was a French Thoroughbred World Record holding racehorse who competed successfully in France and was a Champion in the United States. She was bred by the prominent French horseman Daniel Wildenstein through his breeding company, Dayton Ltd. Out of the mare War Path, her sire was Wildenstein's stallion Faraway Son, a Group 1 winner and the 1971 French Champion Miler.
Racing in France.
In 1977, the three-year-old Waya competed in France for Daniel Wildenstein, where she was conditioned for racing by the Argentine-born trainer Angel Penna, a future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. A winner in her debut at Saint-Cloud Racecourse, Waya also won the Group 3 Prix de Royaumont at Chantilly and the Group 2 Prix de l'Opéra at Longchamp. She ended her French racing career in October 1977 with a record of three wins, two seconds, and a third from her eight starts.
Sent to the United States.
For the 1978 racing season, Waya and her trainer Angel Penna competed on the New York Racing Association circuit, where she won the Flower Bowl Handicap and the Diana Handicap against fillies. In winning the Diana Handicap, she equaled the world record of 1:45 2/5 for 1⅛ miles on grass. She then beat her male counterparts in the Aqueduct Turf Classic Invitational Stakes and the Man o' War Stakes. Against a mostly male field of top American and European horses in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, Waya ran third behind winner Mac Diarmida, whom she beat in the Man o' War Stakes.
New owners and a Championship year.
Waya was sold to Americans George Strawbridge and Peter Brant, who campaigned her in 1979. Under new trainer David Whiteley, she continued to perform at top levels despite being assigned high weights of as much as one hundred and thirty-one pounds. Of her five major wins that year, she once again defeated her male counterparts in the Edgemere Handicap and in her first-ever race on dirt, won the Top Flight Handicap at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack. She was voted the 1979 Eclipse Award as the American Champion Older Female Horse.
As a broodmare.
In early 1980, Waya was retired to broodmare duty at Derry Meeting Farm near Cochranville, Pennsylvania. She was bred to some of the world's top stallions including Red Ransom, Danzig, Seattle Slew, Riverman, Alydar, and twice to Gulch, Mr. Prospector and Nijinsky. Her first foal by Nijinsky was a filly named Vidalia, who raced in Italy and was the 1983 Italian Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. Of her ten other runners, Waya produced eight winners, of which one earned a graded stakes victory.
As a result of complications from laminitis, the twenty-seven-year-old Waya was humanely euthanized at Derry Meeting Farm on December 12, 2001.

Goose egg addling

Goose egg addling is a wildlife management method of population control for Canada Geese and other bird species. The process of "addling" involves temporarily removing fertilized eggs from the nest, testing for embryo development, terminating embryo development, and placing the egg back in the nest. Returning the egg to the nest misleads the goose into believing the egg is still developing. Otherwise, the goose would begin laying again. Though considered more humane than hunting by some, it is not as cost-effective as other measures, such as extended hunting seasons and professional culling. 
In order to work effectively, addling must be conducted in a manner that does not arouse the suspicion of the goose, and must not change the odor, appearance or texture of the egg. Effective addling techniques are disseminated by the Humane Society of the United States and Internet Center for Wildlife Damage Management. Perhaps the easiest way to addle is to coat the egg with corn oil, thereby depriving the embryo of oxygen and killing it.
Canada Geese are covered in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. It is illegal to harm Canada Goose eggs in the U.S. without a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Migratory Bird Management.

Hurricane Otis (2005)

Hurricane Otis was a moderate hurricane that threatened the Baja California Peninsula but dissipated before landfall. Otis developed on September 28, 2005, off the western coast of Mexico, from a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the preceding several weeks. After attaining tropical storm status on September 29, the storm moved in a generally northwestward direction for most of its duration. It ultimately peaked at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale before beginning to weaken. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on October 3 and dissipated fully on October 5, near the coast of Baja California Sur. Preparations for the storm were completed on the Peninsula; tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared and numerous shelters opened. However, the storm's effects were minimal, and limited to gusty winds with heavy rainfall. No major damage was reported.
Meteorological history.
The origins of Hurricane Otis are believed to have been in a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 9. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, spawning Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17. The southern portion of the wave continued westward, crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 22. As the wave entered a monsoon-like environment, convection increased on September 23. An associated area of disorganized clouds and thunderstorms persisted off the coast of Mexico for several days, although due to wind shear and its proximity to land, short-term tropical cyclone development—if any—was expected to occur slowly. On September 27, it began to show signs of organization; the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked upon the potential for a tropical cyclone to develop within the next day. It is estimated that the system became a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 28, while located about to the south of Manzanillo, Mexico.
The depression moved slowly toward the southwest and became better organized, despite a decrease in the coverage of deep convection. By late September 28 the depression was approaching tropical storm status; it turned to the northwest and attained winds of at 0600 UTC on September 29, at which time it was assigned the name Otis. That evening, wind shear relented and conditions became more favorable for the storm's intensification. Convection wrapped almost fully around the center, and early on September 3, Otis was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye feature developed; it quickly became better defined as it entered the scope of weather radar in Cabo San Lucas.
Otis began gradually entering cooler ocean waters, although the National Hurricane Center noted in one of its discussions on the system that the environment was still warm enough to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105 mph (165 km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low-level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5.
Preparations and impact.
On September 30, the first tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued with the declaration of tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches along portions of the east and west coasts of the Baja California Peninsula. For several days the advisories were adjusted and amended, and on October 1, a hurricane warning was posted for the west coast of Baja California, from Agua Blanca to San Andresito. By October 2, all watches and warnings were discontinued on the east coast of the peninsula, and the remaining advisories were lifted the next day. High winds and heavy rainfall were anticipated.
In advance of the storm, the governor of Baja California Sur, Narciso Agundez, ordered emergency personnel to Comondú, Lorteo, and Mulege. Approximately 700 families fled to shelters in Cabo San Lucas; elsewhere, an additional 200 families evacuated in San Jose del Cabo. Some residents in Miraflores and Santiago also left their homes. Agundez asked soldiers to assist the islands of Magdalena and Margarita in preparing for the storm. Five communities in Mexico, including Cabo San Lucas, declared a state of emergency. Authorities throughout the region opened numerous shelters, and in some locations, police officers went door-to-door asking residents to leave. The port in Cabo San Lucas was closed due to the storm's threat, although the airport remained open.
Although the center of Otis remained offshore, tropical storm-force winds were reported at higher elevations over portions of southern Baja California. At Cabo San Lucas, an automated weather station recorded a wind gust to on September 30, with sustained winds of . There, periods of heavy rainfall mixed with fair skies as the storm passed. No damages or fatalities were reported, although some media reports indicated that the storm caused flooding in parts of the southern Baja California peninsula. Offshore, two ships reported tropical-storm-force winds in association with the storm: the "Volendam" on October 3, and the "Star Harmonia" on October 1.

Short N.2B

The Short N.2B was a prototype British patrol seaplane of the First World War, designed and built by Short Brothers. A single engined biplane intended to replace Short's successful Type 184, only two were built, the Fairey III being preferred.
Development and design.
In 1917, the British Admiralty released Specification N.2B for a long range patrol seaplane to replace the Short Type 184 in Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) service. The Short Brothers response to this specification, designated Short N.2B was a single engined, unequal span biplane with two-bay folding wings. While Short's wanted to fit a Rolls-Royce Eagle engine, this was rejected by the Admiralty owing to an expected shortage of these engines, with the Sunbeam Maori substituted.
Eight prototype Short N.2Bs were ordered together with competing aircraft from Fairey (the Fairey III). The first prototype flew in December 1917. When it was tested at the Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain in February 1918, it showed performance no better than the Short 184 with the same engine. While modification with a different propeller and attempts to reduce drag did improve performance, the Fairey III was preferred, being ordered into production in versions powered by both the Maori and Eagle engines, with only the first two prototype Short aircraft being built.
In May 1919, Short's modified the second prototype with an Eagle engine salvaged from the modified Short N.1B Shirl "Shamrock", which had crashed during an attempt to cross the Atlantic, the revised aircraft showing greatly improved climb rate but with speed only increased by 8 mph (13 km/h). The Maori was re-instated, and the second prototype delivered to the Royal Air Force in January 1920.

Ceanothus greggii

Ceanothus greggii, with the common name desert ceanothus, is a species of shrub in the buckthorn family, Rhamnaceae. 
Distribution.
It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico where it grows in desert scrub, sagebrush, chaparral, and other dry habitats. 
It was named for its collector Josiah Gregg, who found the plant in 1847 at the site of the Battle of Buena Vista in the state of Coahuila, in northern Mexico during the Mexican-American War by Asa Gray of Harvard University in 1853. 
Description.
This shrub grows erect to nearly in maximum height. Its woody parts are gray in color and somewhat woolly. The evergreen leaves are oppositely arranged and variable in shape. They may be toothed or smooth along the edges. The inflorescence is a small cluster of many white flowers. It blooms in spring. The fruit is a horned capsule a few millimeters wide which bursts explosively to expel the three seeds which require thermal scarification from wildfire before they can germinate. 
This shrub is eagerly browsed by livestock and wild ungulates such as Mule deer and Desert Bighorn Sheep.

Leo Lentelli

Leo Lentelli (20 October 1879 - 31 December 1961) was an Italian sculptor who immigrated to the United States. During his 52 years in the United States he created works throughout the country, notably in New York and San Francisco. He also taught sculpture.
History.
Born in Bologna, Italy, Leo Lentelli studied in Bologna and Rome and worked as a sculptor in his native land. Immigrating to the United States in 1903 at the age of 24, Lentelli initially assisted in the studios of several established sculptors. In 1911 he entered the Architectural League exhibition and won the Avery Prize. The following year he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Chosen to provide sculptural ornament for the Panama-Pacific Exposition, Lentelli moved to San Francisco in 1914. He collaborated with Frederick George Richard Roth and Stirling Calder. Calder has been credited with aiding Lentelli in developing his own style. An example can be seen in his "Water Sprites".
His long-limbed figures with hair and draperies in loose frills like seaweed made striking fountain statues and lent themselves well to architectural decoration. The surfaces were left rough for the sake of variety of texture and to give an effect of spontaneity. He also participated as a sculptor in the city's artistic renewal, which took place after the 1906 earthquake and fire. While in San Francisco he taught at the California School of Fine Arts. Significant works from this period include the "Five Symbolic Figures" at the Old Main Library elevated above the street entrance of the Larkin Street entrance. Still a resident of San Francisco, he made the ornament for the Orpheum Theater, then known as the Historic American Theater, at Saint Louis and created two-figure groups depicting pioneers on the Dennis Sullivan Gateway at Denver, Colorado.
Returning to New York City, he began teaching at the Art Students League. He also taught at the Cooper Union and became an academician of the National Academy of Design. Lentelli gained fame through his "The Savior with Sixteen Angels" for the reredos at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, as well as his public sculpture for the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. Among his important works are an equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia (collaboration with Henry Shrady), and a 1932 monument to Cardinal Gibbons located north of Meridian Hill Park in Washington, D.C. A benignity is achieved in the latter, its decorative element accented in the carved chair and graceful folds of the cassock. During the New Deal Lentelli created four statues for the Post Office in Oyster Bay, Long Island, dated 1937: a terracotta bust of Theodore Roosevelt, two terracotta panels and ornamentation at the base of the flagpole. During the same period, he also created sculpture for the post office of North East, Pennsylvania. His statue of Apollo and a musical muse, located in a lunette of Steinway Hall on 57th Street in New York City, was covered when the building was sold, but is again on display. Other ornamental figures include "Bagnante", a "Diana", and "Leda". In addition to figures, Lentelli sculpted panels and bas-reliefs for many distinguished buildings. He ornamented a frieze on the Free Academy building at Corning, New York with a panel of children's figures. Lentelli's bas-reliefs on the International Building at Rockefeller Center are considered among his most important works.
Among Leo Lentelli's marks of recognition are the 1922 Medal of Honor of the Architectural League of New York and Gold Medal at the National Academy of Design exhibition in 1927. He was a fellow of the National Sculpture Society, an associate member of the National Academy of Design and a member of the Architectural League of New York. In 1955 Lentelli retired to Italy and died on December 31, 1961 in Rome.
Other works.
Though best known for his work at Rockefeller Center in New York City, he created sculpture which can be seen at a number of other locations, including the following:

Interactive systems engineering

Interactive systems engineering is considered as an interdisciplinary field with computer engineering, systems engineering, interaction design, software development, aesthetic, ethnography, psychology and usability factors involved. It targets current trends in the design and development of interactive systems which virtually includes all types of devices and systems which a human interacts with. It talks about four types of interaction in computer systems: the interaction between a human and computer (also addressed as human–computer interaction), interaction between computer systems, and interaction between users through the computer system. Traditionally human–computer interaction is divided into three subject: design, user experience, engineering. Interactive system engineering is more concerned about the latter subject.
Engineering and design.
One such trend is towards highly collaborative scenarios where groups of people interact within environments with many devices and services, typically utilizing many modalities. Another trend is towards distributed, mobile and heterogeneous (physically and socially) work settings. On a basis of modeling, programming, design and theory building, interactive systems engineering specializes in collaborative computing, ubiquitous computing, adaptive user interfaces, affective interaction, multimodal interaction, multimodal interfaces, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, cognitive, social science, principles of visualization.
In general the need for professional people trained in the design, development and management of interfaces and interactive systems is growing. Engineers with a specialization in interactive systems are necessary both in industry and in other sectors of society. Important industrial sectors include manufacturing, process control, telecommunication, transportation, health care, media and entertainment. Perhaps the most obvious recent example of the importance of interactive systems design is the design of services in mobile and wireless communication settings.
An interactive systems designer defines personas, scenarios, and requirements to guide designs, inspire clients and builds consensus concerning the affordance, usability, visibility, mapping and feedback.
In research about IT design, expertise and methodology for studying human communication are increasingly important, both for understanding and studying the situated use of computer artifacts generally, and for analyzing the rapidly growing applications of information technology for communication and cooperation.
Industry.
There are a lot of different roles on the market for an interactive systems engineer. Some companies do not consider the usability aspect at all while some have it as their core.
Working as an interaction designer requires a good knowledge things like PowerPoint, Flash, PhotoShop, web tools and other rapid prototyping tools, but only a small piece of a much larger toolbox. The interaction designer is concerned with interactions where at least one human user is present, i.e. human-system, or human-human, and of course human-system-human (e.g. telephones).
To make a good design the designer must have knowledge of how humans behave and react, but also what the technology can provide in order to create the best possible interaction experience. Also, in a development project, the interactive systems engineer must provide and evaluate sketches, models and prototypes of the developing system, and then follow up on their implementation, to make sure that the design meets the requirements set up for it.
In practice the interactive systems engineer is working close with the system designers, the users (of course) and basically everyone who has the power to influence the result. The ID must be present during specification, requirement, implementation, testing and marketing, and plan for all these phases, and be ready to re-plan when functional, financial or technological constraints evolve (as they always do).
The interactive systems engineers are probably less concerned with the decisions on the lower levels, like what kind of database management system is used, implementation languages, communication protocols and such. In industry the programmer and interaction designer are rarely separated. As a computer programmer, you can work in developing all the aspects of the user interface, evaluating user experience... you will rarely, I believe, find a job as an interaction designer that does not involve some programming, although you would be more qualified to later manage projects (regarding user-machine interaction systems) than just having programming knowledge, as you will possess an overall knowledge.
Research.
In research there is a lot of room for interaction systems engineers as they are necessary to get the full picture and coordinate the work from 
the different parties involved, understanding the technological requirements as well as the user's needs and the user experience.

Appearance and behavior.
Sika stand 90–120 cm at the shoulder. Males are larger and bear deciduous antlers. The summer coat is light brownish, with obvious white spots, while in winter their coat is darker and the spots fade.
Range and habitat.
The natural distribution of sika on Taiwan was in the woodlands from sea level up to about 300 m elevation. Sika, like many deer, prefer areas of mixed forest, scrub, and open land. Under natural conditions the low-lying alluvial plain that stretches from present-day Taipei along the west coast almost to the southern tip of the island were prime deer habitat and natural populations would have been quite dense.
Status.
Sika populations in Taiwan have been heavily influenced by human activity for the past four hundred years. Until the early 17th century the human population of Taiwan was low and comprised mostly Austronesian peoples who had been living on the island for thousands of years. During the 17th century immigration from the Chinese mainland increased dramatically in response to political instability in China and economic opportunities on Taiwan, which from 1624 until 1684 was controlled by the Dutch East India Company. The company, operating from the port of Taiwanfu (now Tainan) in southwestern Taiwan, established a trading post whose main business was the export of sika skins to Europe. During the six decades of Dutch activity two to four million sika skins were exported to Europe. Exporting was reduced when the Dutch were forced out of Taiwan in 1684, but continued throughout the Qing period with a switch to Japan as the major export market.
The intensive hunting of sika during the Dutch era must have severely decreased the population of sika. Sika populations continued to decline over the next few centuries as the human population expanded—the natural habitat of sika in the lowland plains was steadily converted to farmland, and later urbanized, as the human population increased. Hunting also continued. As a result, wild sika populations decreased steadily, and in 1969 the last known wild sika was killed.
However, deer are easily kept in captivity and there were a number of captive populations of "C. n. taiaoanus". In 1984 Taiwan’s Council of Agriculture funded the Sika Deer Reintroduction Project, based at Kenting National Park on the southern tip of the island. Twenty two deer were transferred from the Taipei zoo to serve as a founder population. Over the next 10 years the deer were maintained in enclosures until their eventual release into the National Park in 1994. Altogether over 200 deer have been released and the current population, now spread beyond the park borders, is estimated to exceed 1000 individuals. Discussions regarding other possible reintroduction sites, including Yangmingshan National Park near Taipei, are ongoing.

Greece–Kyrgyzstan relations

Greece–Kyrgyzstan relations are foreign relations between Greece and Kyrgyzstan. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1992. Greece is represented in Kyrgyzstan through its embassy in Almaty (Kazakhstan). Kyrgyzstan is represented in Greece through a non resident ambassador based in Bishkek (in the Foreign Ministry). Kyrgyz consular representation in Greece is made by the Kazakh consulate in Athens. What is now Kyrgyzstan was settled by Scythians and was conquered by Alexander the Great.
Official visits.
In 2002, the deputy Kyrgyz foreign minister, Asanbek Osmonaliyev visited Greece to discuss the prospects for "bilateral political cooperation and the possibilities of arranging an official visit by the Kyrgyz president, Askar Akayev, to Greece".
On November 1, 2004, Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev made an official visit to Greece to meet Greek President, Konstantinos Stephanopoulos. Akayev said: "It is 12 years since diplomatic relations between the two countries have been established, and this is a good beginning to build close and efficient cooperation. We have good prospects to raise Kyrgyz-Greek relations to a higher level and expand relations in the international arena. ... The aim of my visit is to raise our relations to a different qualitative level and to lay the foundation for their legal basis by signing bilateral documents." A Foreign Ministry delegation from Greece visited Dushanbe for talks, and had meetings with Tajikistans Foreign Minister Zarifi and First Deputy Foreign Minister Youldashev in 2008. Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyannis met with Tajikistans Foreign Minister Zarifi during the 1st EU-Central Asia Forum on security issues in Paris in September 2008.
Emigrants.
Between 650 and 700 people of Greek descent live in Kyrgyzstan; however, the data of the General Secretariat For Greeks Abroad give an even lower number (50 people). See Greeks in Kyrgyzstan for more details.
Bilateral agreements.
In 2004, Greece and Kyrgyzstan signed a bilateral agreement for air transport, tourism and diplomacy during Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev's visit to Greece.

Violent non-state actor

A violent non-state actor (VNSA) is an organization that uses illegal violence (i.e. force not "officially" approved of by the state) to reach its goals. The term has been used in several papers published by the United States military.
Description.
Thomas, Kiser and Casebeer (2005) assert that "VNSA play a prominent, often destabilizing role in nearly every humanitarian and political crisis faced by the international community".
As a new species of actors in international relations, VNSAs represent a departure from the traditional Westphalian system of states in two ways: by providing an alternative to state governance and challenging the state's monopoly of violence. Phil Williams, in an overview article, states that "violent non-state actors (VNSAs) have become a pervasive challenge to nation-states" in the 21st century".
Williams argues that VNSAs develop out of poor state governance but also contribute to further undermining governance by the state. He explains that when weak states are "unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations", "individuals and groups typically revert to or develop alternative patterns of affiliation". This causes the family, tribe, clan etc. to become "the main reference points for political action, often in opposition to the state".
According to Williams, Globalization has "challenged individual state capacity to manage economic affairs, it has also provided facilitators and force multipliers for VNSAs". Transnational flows of arms, for example, are no longer under the exclusive surveillance of states. With the onset of globalization, development of transnational social capital and alliances, and funding opportunities for VNSAs have all flourished. ".
Different types.
Williams identifies various types of VNSAs:
Criminal organizations and gangs are essentially illegal business organizations. ("Crime for them is simply a continuation of business by other means".) 
Humanitarian engagement.
Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute propose that engagement with 
VNSAs—which they call armed non-state actors—is essential to humanitarian efforts in conflicts, as it is often necessary for facilitating access to those affected and for providing humanitarian assistance. However, humanitarian agencies too often fail to engage strategically with VNSAs. This tendency has strengthened since the end of the Cold War, partly due to the strong discouragement of humanitarian engagement with VNSAs included in counter-terrorist legislation and donor funding restrictions. In their opinion further study is necessary to identify ways in which humanitarian agencies can develop productive dialogue with VNSAs.

William Lewis (judge)

William Lewis (January 22, 1752 – August 16, 1819) was a Pennsylvania attorney and politician.
Lewis was born in 1751 in Edgemont, Pennsylvania to a Quaker family of Welsh ancestry. Lewis read law to enter the bar in 1773. As a lawyer during revolutionary times, he consistently defended other Quakers against charges of treason after they refused to fight in battle or pay taxes. In doing so he participated in creating the foundations of the principle of Conscientious Objection.
Another of his accomplishments was his involvement in the drafting and passage of "An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery"[http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/documents_from_1776_-_1865/20424/abolition_of_slavery/998576] in 1780. This legislation was the first legal action towards the abolition of slavery in the United States of America.
He was in private practice in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania after entering the bar until 1787, when he was elected as a representative to the Pennsylvania State Legislature. In 1789 he became the United States Attorney for the District of Pennsylvania, until 1791.
Lewis received a recess appointment from President George Washington on July 14, 1791, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Pennsylvania vacated by Francis Hopkinson. Lewis was formally nominated on October 31, 1791, and was confirmed by the United States Senate and received his commission on November 7, 1791. He resigned effective on January 4, 1792, and he returned to private practice in Philadelphia until his retirement in 1817.
Lewis is also known for advising Alexander Hamilton on the first national bank and building the Historic Strawberry Mansion in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park in 1789. At the time the house was known as Summerville. Judge Lewis died peacefully at Summerville, at the age of 68. The house was converted into a historic house museum in 1931.

MV Monchegorsk (1983)

MV "Monchegorsk" ("Мончегорск") was an SA-15 class cargo ship built by Wärtsilä in Turku, Finland, in 1983. Named after a town of the same name, the freighter was the tenth ship of a series of 19 icebreaking multipurpose arctic freighters built by Wärtsilä and Valmet for the Soviet Union for year-round service in the Northern Sea Route. These ships, designed to be capable of independent operation in arctic ice conditions, were of extremely robust design and had strengthened hulls resembling those of polar icebreakers.
Initially delivered to the (then) state-owned Murmansk Shipping Company and later handed over to its subsidiary, NB Shipping, the "Monchegorsk" sailed under the Soviet and later Russian flag until 1993, after which she was registered to Cyprus. She was sold for recycling in China in late 2009 after 26 years of service.
History.
Development and construction.
The history of the SA-15 class cargo ships dates back to the late 1970s when the leading Finnish shipbuilders Wärtsilä and Valmet both developed designs that met the requirements set by the Ministry of the Merchant Marine of the Soviet Union (MORFLOT) for the new class of arctic cargo ships capable of year-round operation in the Northern Sea Route. An initial order for nine ships, six for Wärtsilä for FIM 1.2 billion and three for Valmet for FIM 600 million, was placed in July 1980. In the following year three more ships were ordered from Wärtsilä and two from Valmet, resulting in a total order of 14 ships worth of FIM 3.5 billion. While initially the idea of ordering two similar but technically different series of ships for the same purpose was to gain operational experience for the future arctic freighters, shortly after the deal was made public the shipyards approached Sudoimport to agree on a uniform design, resulting in a class of sub-arctic 15,000 DWT cargo ships, the SA-15 class. After the initial series Valmet received another follow-up order for five ships of slightly different design, sometimes referred to as the SA-15 Super class due to the minor improvements based on the operators' experiences in the arctic.
Career.
The "Monchegorsk" was delivered by Wärtsilä in 1983 as the tenth ship of the series. While the ship belonged to the Murmansk Shipping Company (MSCO), a state-owned shipping company that operated mainly in the western parts of the Soviet arctic, she was sent to the east shortly after delivery due to the particularly difficult ice conditions of the winter of 1983. After years of service in the arctic the ownership and management of the "Monchegorsk" was handed over to NB Shipping, a subsidiary of MSCO that operated a number of SA-15 class freighters, and moved to ice-free waters.
On 9 February 2006 the "Monchegorsk" collided with the Brunsbüttel locks in the Kiel Canal. The accident, caused by strong wind, happeed when the locks, closed because of very high tide, were reopened. No major damage to either the ship or the locks was reported.
Evangelos Florakis Naval Base explosion.
In early 2009 the "Monchegorsk" became the centre of an international incident involving Iran, Russia, the US, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Cyprus. The ship was apprehended in the Red Sea by U.S. warships in Task Force 151 having left Iran. Following an on board search suspicious military material was reported and the ship was escorted to Limassol Port on 29 January 2009.
The ship, registered with the Cyprus Merchant Marine was then subject to an international diplomacy struggle as to the fate of its cargo. The US and Israel maintained that the cargo was in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747 which sanctions Iranian arms exports. Israel claimed that the intended destination of the cargo was Palestinian organizations in the Gaza strip, a claim that Iran denied.
Cypriot authorities proceeded to a limited search of on board containers, the result of which was referred to the security council for clarification. Once the breach was confirmed the cargo was confiscated and unloaded onto the island where it was stored in warehouses of the Cypriot National Guard. The inspection revealed containers carrying 120 mm, 122 mm, 125 mm, and 160 mm high explosives that originated in Iran and were destined for Syria. Inspection also revealed 7.62 mm shell casings, compressed gunpowder, silver dollar-sized slugs, primer, and magnesium primers.
More than two years later, on July 11, 2011, those same containers, stored in the open under clearly inappropriate conditions at the Evangelos Florakis Navy Base near Mari, Mari, exploded, leaving 13 people dead and 61 injured. The explosion created a 600-metre wide crater and caused the almost total destruction of the naval base and very severe damages to the nearby power station of Vasilikos. As a result of the damages sustained by the explosion, the Vasilikos power station, which accounted for more than half of all power production in Cyprus was disabled, causing a severe power shortage and rotating power cuts throughout the island. Since Cyprus gets much of its water from desalination plants, the power shortage also led to water shortage.
Decommissioning.
The ship was sold for recycling in China in late 2009 for US$316 per ton, resulting in a scrap price of US$3.4 million for a ship with a light displacement of 10,816 tons. In 2008 a double acting ship operated by Norilsk Nickel was named "Monchegorsk" after the SA-15 class freighter that had once supported the Norilsk–Dudinka operation.
Design.
The hull form of the ship, a result of intensive model tests in both open water and model ice, was very different from that of conventional merchant vessels, being more akin to polar icebreakers than traditional cargo ships. However, in addition to good icebreaking and manoeuvring capabilities in various ice conditions the vessel had to be able to operate in open water without bottom slamming or shipping of green water occurring in rough seas. Despite the compromises the ship had impressive icebreaking capability — the SA-15 class ships were designed to break level ice up to one metre () in thickness with a snow layer of in continuous motion without icebreaker assistance. These ships were also the first freighters in ten years to be built to the highest Soviet ice class notation available for merchant ships, ULA.
The ship had a maximum overall length of or with the stern notch excluded. The breadth of the ship, like all other cargo ships operating in the Northern Sea Route, was limited to by the size of the escorting icebreakers. The shallow waters of the Northern Sea Route limited the draught to , but outside the arctic the cargo capacity of the ship could be increased by allowing the ice-strengthened parts of the hull to become submerged.
The harsh operating conditions of the arctic seas place high requirements on the strength, reliability and redundancy of the propulsion machinery, especially for single-screw ships operating independently without icebreaker escort. For this reason the robust propulsion system had several innovative features and prototype arrangements to improve the ship's operational capability. Propulsion power was provided by two 14-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 14ZV40/48 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines running on heavy fuel oil, each with a maximum continuous output of at 560 rpm. As a precaution against failure of the propeller pitch control mechanism the main engines were directly reversible. The main engines were connected to a single propeller shaft through a double input/single output single-stage reduction gear equipped with separate multi disc clutches and Voith fluid couplings. The hydrodynamic couplings that allow over 100% slipping between input and output shafts were used in difficult ice conditions to increase propeller torque and protect the main engines from large torque variations resulting from propeller blades hitting the ice. The fully locking mechanical clutches were used to improve fuel efficiency when the ship is operating in open water or light ice conditions. Because the power output per shaft of the SA-15 class freighters was at that time one of the highest among icebreaking ships, second only to the "Arktika" class nuclear icebreakers, the propeller of the ship was of extremely robust design. The four-bladed stainless steel controllable pitch propeller was developed and manufactured by KaMeWa specially for the SA-15 project.
Being a multipurpose general cargo ship, the vessel was capable of carrying a wide variety of cargo ranging from general and dry bulk cargoes to containers, heavy cargo, long goods and trailers. The ship had five holds fitted with tweendecks, four forwards and one abaft of the superstructure. The ship, designed to serve the remote arctic regions, was also equipped with flexible winterized cargo handling equipment for loading and unloading in undeveloped ports. For loading and unloading of general cargo, containers and bulk cargo the ship was geared with four deck cranes located on the centerline, one on the aft deck and three forwards of the superstructure. On the continuous tweendeck the ship could also carry roll-on/roll-off cargo which was loaded and unloaded via a stern quarter ramp that could also be lowered directly on ice.

Caverna Magica

Caverna Magica is the second studio album by New Age artist Andreas Vollenweider, released in 1983. It is almost entirely instrumental. It was the direct followup to Vollenweider's breakthrough album, "Behind the Gardens".
The album opens with the sound of a man and woman walking and talking in an unknown language (some of the words - notably in Spanish - can be discerned when the track is played backwards) and then stumbling into an echoing cave and reacting with awe. The sound of dripping water in the cave turns into the rhythm of the music that fades in at this point.
While the album originally stood on its own, in 1990 it and the preceding and subsequent albums ("Behind the Gardens - Behind the Wall - Under the Tree" and "White Winds") were re-released as a two-CD set entitled "Trilogy," suggesting they collectively constituted a single musical entity. 
The full titles of the first two albums lend credence to the suggestion that the three albums are thematically connected. The full title of the first album is "Behind the Gardens—Behind the Wall—Under the Tree..." The ellipsis at the end suggests a continuation. The full title of the next album is "Caverna Magica (...Under the Tree—In the Cave...)" The first ellipsis, followed by the repetition of "Under the Tree" from the first album title, clearly indicates a continuation. The second ellipsis suggests another continuation, which would turn out to be "White Winds (Seeker's Journey)." The last track on the White Winds album is entitled ""Trilogy (At The White Magic Gardens) & The White Winds"".
The title of the first album "is like giving someone directions: "You will find us behind The Garden, behind The Wall, under The Tree...", Vollenweider is quoted as saying on his official web site,
http://www.vollenweider.com.
The title of the second album apparently indicates a continuation of those directions: Under the tree you'll find a magic cavern. This magic cavern could be a metaphor for the recording site. This is borne out by the rest of the Vollenweider quote: "Recording this album we worked completely cut off from the world, in the cellars of the Sinus Studios in Bern (capital of Vollenweider's native Switzerland), which are more than 300 years old. In the shelter of this creative "womb", it was easy to lose track of time and space."
Sinus, where all three albums were recorded, "was a small, underground studio," stated an article in the April 2003 edition of Mojo magazine, quoted at http://www.higgs1.demon.co.uk/barritt/mojo.htm. "It was entered by wooden shutters in the pavement above, which gave the impression of entering a crypt."
The names of some tracks on the album ("Mandragora," "Belladonna," and "Geastrum Coronatum") refer to exotic plants that have medicinal, poisonous and hallucinogenic properties - the sort of plants one might expect to find in a cave, particularly a magic cave.
They are also the sort of plants one might associate with Sinus Studios, which by Vollenweider's time there already was associated with the Swiss psychedelia scene and Swiss rock. In 1972 it had been the recording site of the album "Seven Up," a collaboration between space rock band Ash Ra Tempel and drug-culture figure Timothy Leary.
Any relationship between Caverna Magica track titles and Sinus Studios' history could be entirely coincidental. Vollenweider's official site quotes him as saying the album "was truly like an expedition into the deep realm of this music. The comparison with cave explorers perfectly describes our experience: beyond every corner, in every new corridor, we found unknown spaces. For us, it was as if nobody before us had ever set foot in this territory - an indescribable feeling!"

Mac Diarmida

Mac Diarmida (1975-2005) was an American Thoroughbred Champion racehorse.
Background.
Mac Diarmida was bred by John Hartigan at his Cashel Stud farm in Ocala, Florida. Sired by Minnesota Mac, he was out of the mare Flying Tammie, a daughter of the 1958 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, Tim Tam.
As a weanling, John Hartigan sold Mac Diarmida in a private transaction to Dr. Jerome Torsney, who entrusted his race conditioning to future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Scotty Schulhofer.
Racing career.
Mac Diarmida made two starts at age two without a win. However, at age three he had a Championship year, winning twelve of his fourteen starts including ten in a row on grass surfaces. Ridden by Jean Cruguet, among Mac Diarmida's 1978 wins, he beat older horses in capturing the two most important North American turf races with European competitors: the Canadian International Championship at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada and the Washington, D.C. International at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. Mac Diarmida was voted the 1978 Eclipse Award for American Champion Male Turf Horse.
Wintered in Florida, Mac Diarmida was being readied to race as a four-year-old when he injured himself and had to be retired from racing.
Stud career.
He was sent to stand at stud at Cashel Stud in Ocala, Florida where he had been born. There, he served as a stallion for thirteen seasons before being pensioned. He was the sire of seventy-three winners, including four stakes winners.
Due to the infirmities of old age, on September 8, 2005, the thirty-year-old Mac Diarmida was humanely euthanized. He is buried in the Cashel Farm's equine cemetery.

Harriett Abrams

Harriett Abrams (born 1758- died 8 March 1821, Torquay) was an English soprano and composer. Particularly praised for her performances in the repertoire of George Frideric Handel, Abrams enjoyed a successful concert career in London during the 1780s. Music historian Charles Burney praised the sweetness of her voice and her tasteful musical interpretations.
Biography.
Abrams was born into a large musical family of Jewish descent. Her younger sister Theodosia Abrams (d Torquay, 4 November 1849) was a professional contralto and her youngest sister Eliza Abrams (d Torquay, 21 August 1831) was also a concert soprano and pianist. Other family relatives included Miss G. Abrams, who sang at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with Harriett's for two seasons and sang in concerts in the early 1780s; Jane Abrams, who first sang in a benefit concert organized by Harriet in 1782; William Abrams, who played the violin; and Charles Abrams, who played the cello. The violinist Flora Abrams may have also been a relative but the connection is uncertain.
Abrams studied singing, music theory, and composition with composer Thomas Arne before make her professional opera début as the little gypsy in "May-Day, or The Little Gipsy" on 28 October 1775 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. The opera was written specifically for her by librettist David Garrick and Arne who composed the music. Although possessing a fine voice, Abrams had little stage personality and spent most of her career as a concert performer.
After five years performing at Drury Lane, Abrams became a principal singer at the fashionable London concerts and provincial festivals, appearing regularly from 1780-1790. She notably sang annually in the Handel Commemoration in Westminster Abbey in 1784 and annually in the Handel festivals from 1784-1787. She also sang at the opening of the Concerts of Ancient Music in 1776 and returned there frequently through 1790. Abrams also appeared in various concert series organized by John Ashley, Venanzio Rauzzini, and Johann Peter Salomon and often performed in concerts and recitals with her sister Theodosia. The "Public Advertiser", while praising Harriett's work as a soloist, commented in 1783 that the "Forte of the Sisters … lives manifestly in Duettos". During the 1790s Harriet's public performances became infrequent and she mostly appeared in private concerts with both her sisters. She did, however, give annual benefit concerts open to the public in 1792, 1794 and 1795 which were accompanied by Joseph Haydn on the piano.
Abrams composed several songs, two of which, "The Orphan's Prayer" and "Crazy Jane", became very popular. She published two sets of Italian and English canzonets, a collection of Scottish songs and glees harmonized for two and three voices, and more than a dozen songs, mainly sentimental ballads. A collection of songs published in 1803 was dedicated by Harriett to Queen Charlotte.

Land of Green Ginger

The Land of Green Ginger () is a narrow street at the bottom of Whitefriargate in the old town area of Kingston upon Hull, England. There are a variety of commercial and residential buildings along the street's length. The Land of Green Ginger is also where what may be the world's smallest window can be seen. It was used by the gatekeeper of the George Hotel to look out for stagecoaches and customers.
The street was formerly known as Old Beverley-street. Various suggestions have been proposed for the derivation of its current name. It may simply refer to the sale or storage of the spice ginger in the medieval period. An 1853 record indicates that a Mr. Richardson "has made it most probable that the designation 'Land of Green Ginger' took place betwixt 1640 and 1735". The unknown writer then goes on to speculate that as a Dutch family with the surname Lindegreen (meaning "green lime trees") was known to live in Hull during the earlier part of the nineteenth century that the modern name might be a corruption of "Lindegroen jonger" (Lindegreen junior). Another idea, dating from 1880, proposed a corruption of "Landgrave Granger", meaning a walk or pathway approaching the home of the family Landgrave.

Middle of the Night is a 1959 American drama film directed by Delbert Mann, and released by Columbia Pictures. It was entered into the 1959 Cannes Film Festival. It stars Fredric March and Kim Novak. The screenplay was adapted by Paddy Chayefsky from his Broadway play of the same name.
Plot.
A 24-year-old divorcee, Betty Preisser, a receptionist for a clothing manufacturer, takes some office work home. Her boss, widower Jerry Kingsley, a man of 56, drops by to pick up the documents.
Professional acquaintances but not personal ones, Betty tells Jerry of her loveless marriage to George, a musician. Jerry has a daughter about her age, Lillian, and also a spinster sister, Evelyn, who is very protective of him. 
Jerry works up the nerve to invite Betty to dinner. He meets Betty's mother, Mrs. Mueller, and sister Alice, who share the apartment with Betty. Their relationship grows, but she professes to be leery of dating her employer. Jerry wonders if their age difference is really behind her reluctance. Despite this, a May-December romance between them develops.
Family members strongly disapprove. Mrs. Mueller calls him a "dirty old man," while Jerry's sister calls Betty a "fortune hunter" and him a fool. Lillian's husband Jack offers congratulations, earning scorn from his wife and causing them to quarrel. A colleague, Walter Lockman, trapped in a long and unhappy marriage, urges Jerry to do whatever it takes to find true happiness.
George returns to town and tries to persuade Betty to return to him. In a moment of weakness, they have a romantic tryst. Betty regrets it and explains to Jerry that it meant nothing to her emotionally, but he feels humiliated.
His daughter and sister observe how depressed Jerry has become when he returns home. At his lowest ebb, he learns that Walter has taken an overdose of pills in a likely suicide attempt. Jerry sees it as a sign to seize the joy in life while he still can. He returns to Betty's waiting arms.
Production.
Future Oscar winners Martin Balsam ("A Thousand Clowns", 1965) and Lee Grant ("Shampoo", 1975) also star in this film, which was mildly controversial in its day. It was originally a stage play starring Edward G. Robinson. Some of the stage cast were in the film.

History of the Croatian Navy

The history of the Croatian Navy can be traced from the Middle Ages until modern times.
Early history.
According to Longobard writer Pavlo Đakon from the year 642, Croats have many ships under the city of Siponto (Manfredonia in Southern Italy). There are many records of the problems of the Venetian Republic with Croatian pirates in the Venetian records from the second half of the 7th century. At the time it was a considerable source of revenue for all countries. The same sources speak about Croats as successful ship builders. Already at the time of Prince Vladislav (821-835), the sources mention a strong navy. Thanks to the maritime power of Croatia, prince Mislav of Croatia (835-845) enabled Venice to establish control on the Eastern Adriatic. During the rule of Prince Trpimir (845-864), Croats broke through to Friuli and in front of the Venice itself. During the rule of Prince Domagoj (864-876) the strong Croatian Navy successfully defended its coast from Venice and in 866 the Venetian Doge Partezipazio was forced to conclude peace treaty. A great pest at that time in the Adriatic Sea was the Saracens. Therefore an alliance was made between the Byzantine Empire, Venetia and Croatia and later on between the Pope and the Franks. In 871 the Croatian Navy distinguished itself as ally of Frank Emperor Ludovik II in liberation of Bari from the Saracens.
At the time of Prince Branimir (879-892) or at the time when Croatia becomes a completely independent state, the Croatian Navy continues its rise. That was the time of the famous battle in the Middle Dalmatian local waters and when the Venetians were completely defeated on 18 September 887. Venetian Doge Pietro I Candiano was killed. Between his death in 887 and 948, no new war was recorded between Venice and the Croats, which should mean the Venetians paid tribute to maintain the peace.
In the work of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, "De administrando imperio" it is stated that Croatia, during reign of King Tomislav had 80 "sagenas" (larger ships with 40 sailors) and 100 "konduras" (smaller ships with 10 to 20 sailors, not counting oarsmen). Beside this powerful navy the King Tomislav (910-928) also had strong army with 60 000 horsemen and 100 000 infantrymen. The era of King Stjepan Držislav (969-996) was marked with successful maritime trade and safekeeping of maritime routes and domination of Croatia on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea.
The King of Croatia and Dalmatia Petar Krešimir IV (1058–1074) expanded its kingdom "on land and on sea". In his deed of donation to the convent of Saint Krševan in Zadar in 1069, it is stated that he donates the island of Maun situated "in our Dalmatian sea" ("in nostro dalmatico mari"). The Duke of the Croatian Royal Navy Rusin is mentioned at the time and the fact that the very title of Duke could be borne only by governmental dignitaries is proof of the navy importance.
In the first year of the rule of King Dmitar Zvonimir (1074–1089) Normans invaded the Adriatic Sea. As Normans ally, Dmitar Zvonimir joined in wars against Byzantium. When Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia, invaded the western Balkan provinces of the empire in 1084, Zvonimir sent his fleet to his aid.
Normans conquered cities on the eastern coast. The only thing that is sure is that the island of Rab never fell. The alliance of Normans and Croats made under the influence of the Pope Gregory VII lasted from 1082 to 1084: they led together a series of naval battles against Byzant-Venetian navy.
During the period of personal union with Kingdom of Hungary, the Croatian coast fell under Venice and its naval power deteriorated. But this is the time when the fleet of the Republic of Dubrovnik, which kept its independence, started to rise.
Modern history.
Napoleonic wars.
The independence of Dubrovnik was also kept during Napoleonic wars which shows its strength and effective diplomacy. But the strength of the Republic of Ragusa was also manifested in its maritime power. The size of the Fleet of Dubrovnik in 1800, together with fishing ships, was 673 clippers. 255 of them were bigger ships that sailed outside the territorial waters of Dubrovnik. The total number of transatlantic clippers was 230 ships. The Republic had its consulates in over 80 cities. At that time Dubrovnik had about 7,000 seamen, shipbuilders, shipowners and members of other maritime professions.
The period from 1806 to 1813 was the era of the French rule of Marshall Marmont in Dalmatia and development of maritime trade. Napoleon's rule of Dalmatia was followed by Austro-Hungarian rule and on 2 November 1818 the first steam ship "Carolina" sailed the Adriatic Sea. In early 1838 the free steamship navigation in the Adriatic Sea with regular steamship route Triest-Mali Lošinj-Zadar-Šibenik-Split-Hvar-Korčula-Dubrovnik-Kotor was proclaimed. This year was also marked with cessation of the domination of the clippers and entrance of steamship in the war fleet.
Austro-Hungary.
In June 1866 the Italian King Victor Emanuel II declared war to Austria. Like many times before the Adriatic Sea was a battlefield. Both fleets fought on 20 September opening fierce artillery fire. Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, a commander of the Austrian fleet sails into the harbour of Vis with all gunboats. With victory in Battle of Lissa (Vis) Austria secured dominance on the Adriatic Sea. In 1866 a Croatian officer in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Ivan Lupis, together with Robert Whitehead, constructed the first self-propelled torpedo in Rijeka.
In 1869 the Austrian frigate undertook a trip around the world. "Donau" displaced 2000 tons and carried 350 crew members who were sailors from islands and coast of the Eastern Adriatic, mostly Croats. The ship left Pula in July and returned in March 1871 having sailed the whole Earth. There is a ship log written by a crewmember, Matija Politeo from Starigrad on the island of Hvar.
The period from 1911 to 1914 is especially important for development of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in which most of the crew consisted of Croats. The biggest ships of Austro-Hungarian Navy were launched at that time: , , and . This is also the period in which we can find Croats as high-ranking officers, like admiral Maximilian Njegovan (Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, 1917–1918) or admiral Janko Vuković (commander of SMS "Viribus Unitis").
Post WWI.
After the end of World War I, in 1918 the Austro-Hungarian navy on the admiral ship SMS "Viribus Unitis" in Pula was forced, under order of the Emperor Charles I of Austria, to surrender to delegates of the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs from Zagreb - Ante Tresić Pavičić, Vilim Bukšeg and Ivan Čop and members of the Local National Council in Pula. The Croatian flag was flown then. On the very same day a specially constructed Italian boat called mignata, similar to a guided torpedo, broke through the harbour of Pula and sank the battleship "Viribus Unitis" together with 250 sailors and Commander Janko Vuković.
Yugoslavia.
The navy and merchant navy led by Croatian maritime experts continued to develop at the time of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later in socialist Yugoslavia. During this period, many Croats took over high duties in Yugoslav Navy whose main bases were on the territory of Croatia.
Modern Croatia.
During the breakdown of Yugoslavia in 1991, by the decision of Croatian President from 12 September 1991, began the formation on new Croatian Navy. The first Navy commander appointed was admiral Sveto Letica. The first ship in the naval fleet was landing craft nº 103, but soon Croatia gained possession over 34 ex-ships of Yugoslav navy. It should be noted, however, that a flotilla of three naval trawlers and fishing boats was established in Kali, Ugljan island, under the operational command of the Croatian Army's 112th Brigade on 21 August 1991. The main fleet was formed on 24 September, consisting of six ships.
Two other warships captured by Croatia, the Osa I class RČ-310 "Velimir Škorpik" and the Shershen class TČ-219 "Streljko" were not regarded as seaworthy and were eventually sunk by the missile boats "Kralj Petar Krešimir IV" and OBM-41 "Dubrovnik" in October 1994, during a live firing exercise known as operation "Posejdon". The main actions of the new Croatian navy during the war of independence were the lifting of the Yugoslav blockade of Dalmatia and the relief of Dubrovnik.

History.
The land where the gardens are located has belonged to the Albertas family since 1673. The gardens were originally created in 1751 by Jean-Baptiste Albertas, the first president of the cour des comptes of the town of Aix-en-Provence. In 1790, on July 14, the first anniversary of the French Revolution, he was assassinated by Anicet Martel from Auriol. His son was made a Pair of France by King Louis XVIII, and became Prefet of the Bouches-du-Rhône. 
The gardens fell into disrepair in the first half of the 20th century, and were restored beginning in 1949 by Jean d'Albertas.

Alfredo Ramos Martínez

Alfredo Ramos Martínez (November 12, 1871 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico – November 8, 1946 in Los Angeles) was a painter, muralist, and educator, who lived and worked in Mexico, Paris, and Los Angeles. Considered by many to be the 'Father of Mexican Modernism', Ramos Martínez is best known for his serene and empathetic paintings of traditional Mexican people and scenes. As the renowned Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío wrote, "Ramos Martínez is one of those who paints poems; he does not copy, he interprets; he understands how to express the sorrow of the fisherman and the melancholy of the village.” 
Early years 1885-1900.
Ramos Martínez was born in 1871 in Monterrey, Nuevo León, the ninth child of Jacobo Ramos and his wife Luisa Martínez. His father was a successful merchant trading in jewelry, fine fabrics, silver, embroidered suits and hand-woven sarapes from Saltillo. All members of the Ramos Martínez family were involved with their father’s business and it was expected that the artist, too, would one day join the ranks of “honorable merchant”. However, Ramos Martínez's evident talent and instincts propelled him towards a career in the arts; a choice that his family ultimately supported.
At the age of fourteen, one of Ramos Martínez's drawings, a portrait of the governor of Monterrey was sent to an exhibition in San Antonio, Texas and won first prize. A portion of that prize included a scholarship to study at the most prestigious art school in all of Mexico, the Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes (Academy of Fine Arts) in Mexico City. Thus the entire Ramos Martínez family relocated to Coyoacán, a small town on the outskirts of Mexico City. 
From an early age Ramos Martínez was recognized as prodigiously talented. As a student, his preferred medium was watercolor and he won numerous awards for his achievements. Though he found the teaching methods at the Academy repressive and counter-intuitive to his more emotional plein air impulses, Ramos Martínez created a significant body of work that he was able to sell while still a student. Gratifying as his youthful accomplishments were, the news from France, and the examples of the brilliance of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, persuaded the young painter that he needed to be in Europe to continue his education and define his career. Though his family was by no means poor, they did not have funds to support Ramos Martínez's European dream.
In a supreme bit of good fortune, Phoebe Hearst attended a dinner in Mexico City for the President of Mexico, Porfirio Díaz, which featured place mats designed and painted by the young Ramos Martínez. Hearst was so impressed with the decoration that she asked to meet the artist and see other examples of his work. After their meeting, she not only bought all of Ramos Martínez's watercolors, but agreed to provide financial support for the artist's continued study in Paris.
Paris 1901-1910.
Ramos Martínez's arrival in Paris in 1900 coincided with further development of the Post-Impressionist movement. He was able to see firsthand the work of Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Georges Seurat and Odilon Redon. Furthermore, Hearst’s monthly stipend of 500 francs, combined with Ramos Martínez's fluent French, afforded him a comfortable lifestyle and the ability to travel throughout Europe.
While in Paris, Ramos Martínez attended various artistic and literary salons and made the acquaintance of the modernist Nicaraguan poet, Rubén Darío. Darío and Ramos Martínez became close friends, thus insuring Ramos Martínez 's inclusion in a circle of rather extraordinary "bon vivants" such as Isadora Duncan, Paul Verlaine, Eleonora Duse, Rémy de Gourmont and Anna Pavlova.
Darío wrote at length about the painterly and literary ideas that defined the creative output of both artists during those years. The two sojourned to Belgium and Holland to study the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. The artist’s works from this period are strongly influenced by the somber tonalities of the Dutch sky and sea. 
Also, it was in Brittany, that Ramos Martínez began painting and drawing on newspapers, a material/medium he used to superb effect during his years in California. When the artist discovered he had run out of drawing paper, he asked the concierge at the inn where he was staying during a holiday weekend if he had any paper suitable for drawing. The gentleman offered him discarded newspapers in abundance.
In 1905, Ramos Martínez began participating in the yearly Salon d'Automne in Paris, perhaps the most important of all the salons of that era. Within a year of his first showing there, his painting "Le Printemps" was awarded the Gold medal.
However, after this great acknowledgment, Hearst decided she would no longer give him his monthly stipend and Ramos Martínez began the struggle of earning his living as an artist. 
Ramos Martínez showed at a number of galleries in Paris. One of the leading art critics of the day, Camille Mauclair wrote that the work of Ramos Martínez was in the same class as the finest Impressionist landscapes exhibited in Paris. Though sales of his artwork were proceeding, and Ramos Martínez had achieved a degree of comfort as a ‘Parisian’, in 1909 he felt a strong desire to return home to Mexico.
Mexico 1910-1929.
By the time Ramos Martínez arrived in early 1910, Mexico was a nation in turmoil. The Mexican Revolution was beginning in earnest and the 30-year rule of President Porfirio Díaz was on the verge of collapse due to the pressure of the political reforms of Francisco I. Madero. Within a year of the President’s resignation in 1911, the art students at the National Academy called a strike in order to protest the 'aesthetic dictatorship' of the Academy. They demanded the establishment of a 'Free Academy' and proposed Ramos Martínez as director. Hailed as a distinguished alumnus, a bona fide European success, and sympathetic to the students’ cause, Ramos Martínez became first the assistant Director and, by 1913, the Director of the Academy.
Now, as Director, he was able to open the first of his Open Air Schools of Painting. With the example of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists in mind and fortified by his sense of the primacy of the artist’s personal vision, Ramos Martínez's Open Air Schools redefined the nature of artistic instruction in Mexico.
The first school was established in the Santa Anita Iztapalapa borough of Mexico City with an initial class of 10 students, including David Alfaro Siqueiros and Federico Cantú, who would later become successful artists in their own right. By 1914, Ramos Martínez stepped down as Director of the Academy but opened another Open Air School in Coyoacán. That same year, his students' work was featured in the "Exhibition of Works from Public and Art Schools" at the Spanish Pavilion and met with extremely favorable response.
The political situation in Mexico remained extremely volatile for the next decade and by 1920 Ramos Martínez was reinstated as Director of the Academy. Despite all the politics, the Open Air Schools flourished and Ramos Martínez was acknowledged as a true innovator in the Mexican art world and frequently called the 'Father of Modern Mexican Art'. To quote Ramón Alva de la Canal in “Los acaparadores de murales”, "...the true force behind contemporary Mexican painting wasn't Diego Rivera; it was Alfredo Ramos Martínez."
While Ramos Martínez invested most of his energy in teaching and the establishment of his Open Air Schools, he also continued his own work as a painter. In 1923, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold by King Albert I of Belgium in recognition of his contributions to the visual arts.
In 1928, Ramos Martínez married Maria de Sodi Romero of Oaxaca. Their daughter, Maria was born one year later, suffering from a crippling bone disease. Ramos Martínez resigned as Director of the Academy and sought treatment for his daughter's condition. The family first traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and eventually settled in the milder climate of Los Angeles, with Maria under the care of Dr. John A. Wilson.
California 1930-1946.
Having relocated to Los Angeles in 1929, Ramos Martínez was offered an exhibition by William Alanson Bryan, Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) at Exposition Park. A number of subsequent exhibitions followed, with Martínez developing a strong following in the Hollywood community.
Warner Brothers art director and interior decorator to the stars Harold Grieve acquired a number of works by the artist and championed the artist's work to his clients. Noted film directors Ernst Lubitsch and Alfred Hitchcock, costume designer Edith Head, screenwriter Jo Swerling, and actors Charles Laughton, Gary Cooper, James Stewart, and Beulah Bondi, among others, were collectors. 
Ramos Martínez was also exhibited with great success in San Diego at the Fine Arts Gallery of Balboa Park and in San Francisco at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. It was there that celebrated Bay Area art patron Albert M. Bender first saw Ramos Martínez's work. Bender became a lifelong friend of the artist and acquired numerous works for his personal collection. Furthermore, he purchased and donated Ramos Martínez works to several San Francisco institutions, including the Legion of Honor, the San Francisco Museum of Art, the California Historical Society, and Mills College.
In addition to his mastery of all conventional media including drawing, printmaking, watercolor, and easel painting, Ramos Martínez was an extremely skilled muralist who excelled in the technically challenging art of traditional fresco painting. Though a number of his murals were destroyed, including those at the Chapman Park Hotel in Los Angeles (adjacent to the famous Brown Derby Restaurant) and the Normal School for Teachers (Escuela Normal) in Mexico City, several important examples have survived. These include the Chapel of the Santa Barbara Cemetery (1934); the La Avenida Café, Coronado, California (1938) (later restored and moved to the Coronado Public Library); and the unfinished Margaret Fowler Frescoes, Scripps College, Claremont, California (1945). The Scripps mural was commissioned by the College at the urging of Millard Sheets, the much loved California artist and long-time admirer of Ramos Martínez. One of his most significant frescoes, the "La Guelaguetza", named after the ancient Oaxacan celebration of the Earth's abundance, was commissioned in 1933 by screenwriter Jo Swerling for his Beverly Hills home. Having fallen into obscurity for many years it was rescued before demolition of the residence in 1990. 
Alfredo Ramos Martínez died unexpectedly at the age of 73 on November 8, 1946 in Los Angeles. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. At the time of his death, Ramos Martínez was working on an extensive series of murals at Scripps College. The unfinished murals have been preserved as a tribute to the artist.
Recent history.
After the artist's death, the Dalzell Hatfield Gallery in Los Angeles continued to showcase his paintings and drawings. Maria Sodi de Ramos Martínez, the artist's widow, saw to it that Ramos Martínez was included in numerous gallery exhibitions. Until her death in 1985, she was the primary champion of her late husband's work.
In 1991, Louis Stern presented the first major retrospective of the artist's work since his death. The exhibition, "Alfredo Ramos Martínez (1872–1946)," was on view at Louis Stern Galleries in Beverly Hills from October 1, 1991 through January 6, 1992. This exhibition was the foundation of the monumental Ramos Martínez exhibition, "Alfredo Ramos Martínez (1871–1946), Une Visión Retrospectiva," at Mexico City's renowned Museo Nacional de Arte (MUNAL) in April of that same year.
These two exhibitions became the cornerstones of a re-examination of Ramos Martínez's work and subsequent development of a secondary market for these works. As with the other major Mexican modernists, indigenous peoples were the principal subjects in the mature works of Ramos Martínez. In recent years, several of these paintings have realized high prices on the international art market. His 1938 painting "Flowers of Mexico" brought over $4 million at Christie's, New York in May 2007.

Theophilus Protospatharius

Theophilus Protospatharius (; c. 7th century) was the author of several extant Greek medical works of uncertain status, either from Philaretus or Philotheus. Nothing is known of his life or the time when he lived. He is generally called ""Protospatharius"", which seems to have been originally a military title given to the colonel of the bodyguards of the emperor of Constantinople ("Spatharioi"); but which afterwards became also a high court title, or was associated with the government of provinces and the functions of a judge.
It is conjectured that he lived in the 7th century; that he was the tutor to Stephanus Atheniensis; that he arrived at high professional and political rank; and that at last he embraced the monastic life. All this is, however, quite uncertain; and with respect to his date, it has been supposed that some of the words which he uses belong to a later period than the seventh century; so that he may possibly be the same person who is addressed by the title "Protospatharius " by Photius, in the ninth. He appears to have embraced in some degree the Peripatetic philosophy; but he was certainly a Christian, and expresses himself on all possible occasions like a man of great piety: in his physiological work especially he everywhere points out with admiration the wisdom, power, and goodness of God as displayed in the formation of the human body.
Five works are attributed to him:

Santos Balmori

Santos Balmori Picazo (b. Mexico City, Sept. 26, 1899 – d. Mexico City, March 5, 1992) was a Spanish-Mexican painter whose heavily European style was not appreciated by his contemporaries of the Mexican muralism movement, but he had influence with the succeeding Generación de la Ruptura artists. He trained and began his art career in Europe moving later to Mexico City. He became a professor and researcher at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas training younger artists such as Rodolfo Nieto, Pedro Coronel, Carlos Olachea and Juan Soriano. As a teacher, he did not stop drawing but he did not paint professionally again until after retirement, having a number of exhibitions later in life.
Life.
Balmori Picazo was born in Mexico City on September 26, 1899 to Ramón Balmori Galguerra from Asturias, Spain and Everarda Picazo from Mexico.
He spent his first four years of life in a community called Soberrón near Llanes, Asturias with his mother, Everanda Picazo de Cuevas, dying in Spain. The family then moved to Mendoza, Argentina. They then moved by mule across the Andes to live in Santiago de Chile. When he was sixteen, Balmori’s father, Ramón Balmori Galguera, committed suicide.
He entered the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Santiago but his guardians did not want him to study art. In 1919, he went to Europe to study, starting at the Academy of San Fernando in Spain. His teachers in San Fernando included José Moreno Carbonero, Joaquín Sorolla and Julio Romero de Torres and studied with Salvador Dalí and Remedios Varo. He was offered a chance to immigrate to Rome as a distinguished Spanish student but since the offer required that he renounce his Mexican citizenship, he declined. The Academy of San Fernando believed that the ideal was to reproduce reality without distortions but Balmori rebelled against this idea. For this reason, he gave up studies here for Paris at age twenty two. He lived for the next fourteen years in Paris, at first studying at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière under sculptor Antoine Bourdelle and learning about new movements in art. He struggled economically, but also met a number of famous artists, studying the work of Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque and Matisse along with those of Italian Futurists and German Expressionists. He also had his first professional success as an artist.
He studied trancendental meditation and because of health problems, spent time in Oran, North Africa.
He favored the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, which lead to his detention in Spain. After he returned to Mexico, he continued this support, opening a school for children of Spanish exiles.
Balmori Picazo was married three times, all to dancers. His first wife was French dancer Therese Bernard, who died shortly after from Addison's disease. His second wife was Rachel Björnstrom, which whom he had a daughter, Kore Monica, who fell ill with polio. Rachel took the child to Sweden and never returned. His last marriage was to Helena Jordán Juárez and lasted over forty years until his death.
He died at age 93 in Mexico City on March 5, 1992 from heart and respiratory failure.
Career.
Balmori Picazo began his career in Paris, where he met Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck, Tsuguharu Foujita, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, doing a portrait of Gandhi. He collaborated with Henri Barbusse on the weekly Monde, illustrating texts by writers such as Miguel de Unamuno, Maxim Gorki, Albert Einstein and Upton Sinclair. He also designed textiles, flyers and created engravings and paintings as well as posters against fascism, which earned him international awards. However, his anti-fascist activism along with collaboration with Federico García Lorca, Unamuno and León Felipe got him into trouble with the Spanish government.
His first exhibitions were also in Europe, first at the Duncan Gallery in Paris. He traveled to Sweden for various successful exhibitions, then to Brussels and Madrid before he returned to Mexico, exhibiting in Mexico City. However, Mexico from the 1930s to 1950s was highly nationalistic with the painters from the Mexican muralism movement dominating, making Balmori’s more international style less appealing. He became a professor for about thirty years at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas and was also the head of the Academia de la Danza Mexicana with Miguel Covarrubias. During this time (1950s) he actively promoted new dance movements in Mexico, including the production of posters, wardrobes and librettos. His art students included Rodolfo Nieto, Pedro Coronel, Carlos Olachea and Juan Soriano. He was also an important fine arts researcher and writer, publishing articles books and essays on the topic as well as poetry. Two books, Aurea Mesura and Técnica de la expression plástica, were published by UNAM.
In his later career, he taught drawing, painting and composition at La Esmeralda and at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas, both in Mexico City.In 1973, he held an exhibition called "Espacios y tensiones" at the Museo Tecnológico de la Comisión Federal de Electricidad. This consisted of a series of paintings that demonstrated yet new ideas in his artistic conceptions. This and the later "Lunar Route" exhibitions were among his most important shows.
Although he never stopped drawing, he returned to painting professionally after he retired from teaching at age seventy, exhibiting several times. His drawings include those of dancers such as Raquel Gutierrez, Rosa Reina and his wife Helena, as well as sketches of the Ballet Antigona which was headed by José Limón. His work can be found at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Toluca, the Museo de Universitario de Artes y Ciencias at UNAM, the Museo de la Estampa, the Museo de Arte Moderno in Madrid, the National Gallery in Prague and the Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias .
When he was ninety, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a homage for him along with the Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias in Oviedo, Spain, both with large retrospectives of his work. Other retrospectives of his work have been held after his death such as the 1996 event at the Casa Lamm Cultural Center in Mexico City and the Mexican Cultural Center in Paris in 1998.
Artistry.
Balmori’s painting varied among the various painting styles of Europe of the 20th century as well as influence from Mexican muralism. While studying in Madrid, observing copies of Greek, Roman and Egyptian statues, he declared that beyond all forms there is a universe of light and shadow, whose mysteries, he stated, were for painters to discover. His portraits of Gandhi show academic and classical influence with some distortion of form and geometric shapes showing influence from Cubism and Picasso. Influence from Mexican muralism can be seen in realistic images and figurativism. Balmori was not influential directly in Mexican art as when he returned to Mexico in the 1930s, his European influence work was not popular. His work was not recognized by his contemporaries, with the exception of Carlos Mérida, but did have influence on the following Generación de la Ruptura.

Time (Clock of the Heart)

"Time (Clock of the Heart)" is a song by the British new wave band Culture Club, released as a stand-alone single in most of the world and as the second single from their debut album "Kissing to Be Clever" in North America. Following on the heels of the band's global #1, "Do You Really Want to Hurt Me", "Time (Clock of the Heart)" peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart, selling over 500,000 copies in the UK. In the United States, the song matched the #2 peak of its predecessor on the Billboard Hot 100, kept from #1 by "Flashdance... What a Feeling" by Irene Cara.
In Europe and United Kingdom, it was a stand-alone single, released in November 1982. For this market, its first inclusion on a Culture Club album was on their 1987 compilation, called "This Time: The First Four Years". 
In a retrospective review of the song, Allmusic journalist Stewart Mason wrote: "Of all of Culture Club's early hits, "Time (Clock of the Heart)" has probably aged the best. Boy George drops the cryptic self-mythology long enough to deliver a tender, heartfelt lyric on lost love."
The music video has been released in two versions. The only difference was a scene where the group is watching TV, along with vocalist Helen Terry. In one version, a Christmas tree is shown. In the other, the tree is removed. This was because of the date of release for certain markets. The "Christmas" version (which is on the 2005 DVD "Greatest Hits"), was for European countries and the "regular version" was for the other markets, where the song was released in spring 1983.

Elle (magazine)

Elle is a worldwide lifestyle magazine of French origin that focuses on fashion, beauty, health, and entertainment. "Elle" is also the world's best selling fashion magazine. It was founded by Pierre Lazareff and his wife Hélène Gordon in 1945. The title, in French, means "she" or "her".
History.
"Elle" was founded in France in 1945. In the 1960s, it was considered to "not so much reflect fashion as decree it", with 800,000 loyal readers and a then famous slogan: "Si elle lit elle lit Elle (If she reads, she reads Elle)". In 1981, Daniel Filipacchi and Jean-Luc Lagardère purchased Hachette magazines, which included the then-struggling "Elle". "Elle" was then launched in the U.S. (News Corporation owned a stake in the US edition until 1988, followed by 25 other foreign editions). Among its past editors is Jean-Dominique Bauby, who became known for writing a book after suffering almost total paralysis.
Operations.
Today, it is the world's largest fashion magazine, with 43 international editions in over 60 countries. Technologically speaking, the "Elle" brand is a global network encompassing over 33 websites. Subscriptions account for 73 percent of readers. There are 33 "Elle" websites globally, which collectively attract over 25 million unique visitors and 370 million page views per month. "Elle" reaches over 21 million readers. The vast majority (82 percent) of "Elle"'s audience are women between the ages of 18 and 49. "Elle" readers have a median age of 34.7 years. Forty percent of readers are single, and the median household income is $69,973. "Our readers are young enough to think about life as an adventure and old enough to have the means to live it", said Robbie Myers, editor in chief. Elle owes its graphic signature to art director Peter Knapp
"Elle" is owned by the Lagardère Group of France. It is published in the US by Hearst Magazines, in Canada by Transcontinental Media, in Brazil by Grupo Editora Abril, in Mexico by Grupo Expansión, in Argentina by Grupo Clarín, in Singapore by Mediacorp, in Serbia by Adria Media, in Turkey by Doğan Burda Magazine, in Germany by Hubert Burda Media, in Romania by Ringier, and in other countries including Portugal and Spain.

Feliciano Béjar

Feliciano Béjar Ruíz (1920 – February 1, 2007) was a Mexican artist and artisan, best known for a style of sculpture called “magiscopios” which involved various materials along with crystals and/or lenses to play with light or create distorted visions. He was born in rural central Mexico and was completely self-taught as an artist. He was creative as a young child, drawing and creating his first sculpture like pieces from papier-mâché. His art career began in New York, where he had travelled and lived for a time in Hell’s Kitchen. His drawing the attention of Arthur Ewart and Frances Coleman, with the latter helping him have his first exhibition and whose husband helped sponsor his time in Europe. The magiscopes arose from an intense interest in light and the sun, which began when he saw a boy in Italy playing with reflections of the sun in puddles. Images of the sun appeared in his painting and sculpture, developing into the use of crystals and lenses. In his later life, Béjar withdrew from the art world for about sixteen years, disillusioned with it and retreating to his ranch in the State of Mexico. He returned in 1998, with a retrospective of his work in Mexico City and continued to show his work until shortly before his death.
Life.
Feliciano Béjar Ruíz was born in 1920 in Jiquilpan, Michoacán, between the Sierra Madre Occidental and Lake Chapala, which was a very small and rural town when he was a child. He came from devout Catholic parents, who were not native to Jiquilpan, but instead arrived very poor there. For this reason, he and his family were considered to be outsiders. As a boy, Béjar was an acolyte and wanted to become a priest.
The Cristero War took a toll on him. Members of his family were abused and killed by the army during the conflict and his primary school was closed down by authorities. He was sent to middle school at the Colegio Salesiano de Artes y Oficios in Guadalajara, where he learned various trades such as carpentry and metalworking, but he was there only two years before the government shut that down too.
After he return from Guadalajara, he worked with his father, who made a living selling notions, make up, perfume and other items on the street. He also worked as an assistant to a carpenter, sweeping out the shop in exchange for wood scraps. He used these to create toys and even large imaginary cities.
When he was eight, he came down with polio, and had to use crutches until he was thirteen. Later in life, this affected his work, generally creating his pieces on the floor with one leg folded under for comfort.
When he was fifteen, he began to teach himself art using various scrap materials. At this time muralist José Clemente Orozco was in his town to paint scenes of the Mexican Revolution on the town library. Orozco was aloof and although Bejar brought him some drawings to show, he did not want to see them. Later in life he stated that he did not think well of the muralists and considered them false and frauds. He said that there work was supposedly for the people but they could not be understood without interpretation and the main ones (Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco) shut out other artists.
Béjar spent a number of his younger years traveling. When he was little, his grandmother Jesusa took him with her to other towns and even to Acapulco which let him know there was more out there. He came across a book called “Around the World” which impressed him, describing New York City in glowing terms. He saved the bus fare to travel there, but nothing more. When he got to New York in the 1940s, he was disappointed and thought it ugly. He wanted to return but had no money so he had to work menial jobs and live in Hell’s Kitchen. During this time in New York, he was put in touch with English painter Arthur Ewart who encouraged him to get back to art, particularly painting. He also met socialite Frances Colman, while coping paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who helped him get started selling his work. In 1947, he returned to Mexico. Coleman helped him have an exhibition in New York and in 1949, Béjar traveled to Paris and bicycled through Europe to study the art in the museums there, sponsored by UNESCO and Coleman’s husband. He returned again to Mexico in 1950.
He returned again to Europe in 1956, where he painted and worked as a movie extra and radio announcer.
In 1960, Béjar met Englishman and historian Martin Foley, who had come to Mexico to study. They remained friends for over forty years and lived together at Béjar’s ranch until his death, with Foley writing Béjar’s biography. Foley never entered Béjar’s studio because he was concern with stepping on something.
Later in his life, Béjar abandoned his hometown, stating it had become too large and too loud, losing much of its traditional architecture. He bought and developed a ranch in the municipality of Jilotepec, State of Mexico. His house here had flooding problems, with one major flood in 1981 severely damaging the house and gardens and destroyed most of the artwork which it contained. However, he considered himself an artisan first, valuing his skills as a carpenter, metalworker and bricklayer, rebuilding the house and gardens himself.
In the early 1990s, he withdrew from his art career, disillusioned by the art work, and in 1993, he was confined to a mental facility by his family involuntarily. Although he left the hospital some time later, a number of his family members still considered him crazy.
Béjar was considered to be an environmentalist. One reason for this was that in his early career, he had a sign in front of his house offering to take used materials for his art, and received much. It made him reflect on how much is wasted. His interest in ecology was also spurred by his time in Mexico City, when he lived for a while near Paseo de la Reforma, seeing how its trees and old mansions were deteriorating.
From the 1990s to a few years before his death, Béjar was withdrawn from the art world, secluding himself on his ranch and returning to his religious roots. His agricultural activities on his ranch kept him connected with his rural roots, creating artificial lakes, planting trees and crops and raising bees. He stated in an interview at that time that he was happier with his family at the ranch, which consisted of his companion Martin Foley, two Nahua women named Perfecta and Susana, who he considered daughters and an adopted son name Martín Feliciano Béjar (b. 1983).
Béjar died in Mexico City on February 1, 2007 of heart failure while in a hospital for tests. He was 86. He left behind about 100 unfinished pieces because of his system of working. He was buried at his ranch in the State of Mexico. Much of his finished and unfinished work is now in the hands of Martin Foley.
Career.
Although Béjar did painting, handcrafts and even trades, he is best known for his sculpture, especially a class of sculpture called “magiscopios.” These were created with metal, glass, crystal, plastic and resins, and feature crystals and lenses that distort the onlookers view. He created the first of these with waste metal and other scraps. After he created his first one, he invited Paco de al Maza, Justino Fernández, Salvador Novo and others for dinner. After seeing the work they thought about names with Jorge Hernández Campos coming up with “magiscopio.” When Béjar exhibited these magiscopios at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1966, he signified a break for a generation of avant garde sculptors, and from traditional Mexican sculpture. It created the idea of art as a game, essentially a leisure activity. The magiscopios brought Béjar fame and many of them were copied and reproduced; however, their popularity meant that no one wanted to see his paintings, which bothered him. The popularity also meant that he stopped making them from scraps, especially when he was hired as an artist-in-residence for Carburandum in the US, their first from Latin America. He signed a contract for five years which allowed him to work at their factory and work with larger pieces of materials. His last major completed work was a series of 120 magiscopios.
Béjar’s art career began as a painter, and began in New York where he had his first individual exhibition of 18 paintings at the Ward Eggleston Gallery in 1948. However, this success did not open doors for him in Mexico when he returned, not being able to do so until he had the support of the Instituto Mexicano Norteamericano. This show brought his work to the favorable attention of Mexican art critics. However, over his lifetime he had over 150 individual exhibitions and his work appeared in about 100 collectives ones, both in Mexico and abroad. He had a sixteen year break in exhibiting his work until 1998, when the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes sponsored a retrospective. They wanted to have it at the Palacio de Bellas Artes or the Museo de Arte Moderno, but Béjar refused, stating that these avenues were too closed to new artists, so instead it was held at the Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil. His last exhibition was as the House of the First Print Shop in the Americas in Mexico City shortly before he died, and his last public work was a pair of colored shoes which were auctioned off for charity for 10,000 pesos.
He received a number of awards but stopped accepting when the Bank of Mexico asked him to purchase the medal he was awarded because they lacked resources. He also became disenchanted with the attention given to him by politicians including Mexican presidents. He was a member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana 
Béjar was a prolific creator and while much of his production has been acquired for permanent collection, much is in the possession of his longtime friend Martin Foley. At least 75 of his works are part of major museum collections in Brazil, the United States, Great Britain and Israel.
Since his death in 2007, there have been events to pay homage and exhibitions of his work, including a 2010 homage and conference at the Liberator Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla Cultural Center in his hometown in Michoacán and a major exhibition of his work at the Museum of Light in Mexico City in 2013. There have also been efforts to create a formal museum in Béjar’s memory. His former home in Michoacán has been opened to the public and contains a collections of his paintings, sculptures and handcrafts.
Artistry.
While best known as a sculptor, he was also a painter, artisan and a tradesman, not seeing differences between artist and artisan, instead considering them inseparable. When he thought about his works, he always referred back to his creation of toys, and the fireworks castles his Uncle Jesús created in Cotija and even continued drawing on cardboard as he did as a child. He worked with various techniques such as painting, drawing, engraving and sculpture in wood, ceramic, soldered metal, bronze, stone, stainless steel, crystal and plastic. He defined himself as a creator who did not belong to the artistic elite on Mexico. Although not considered part of the Generación de la Ruptura, his work did open new avenues for artists in Mexico. He was noted for his use of geometry, transparency and light and was contrarian in various aspects. For example he began to work in terracotta when many artisans were dismissing it in favor of porcelain.
Some of his very first artistic works as a child involved paper mache and old wire, and the use of recycled materials characterize much of his early sculptural work. His early paintings generally had religious themes related to rural Mexico, something he returned to in his later life. He worked daily on one or more artistic project, with many in progress. He considered it a waste of time to write notes or create sketches. Some of his sculptures have taken twenty years to complete.
The most noted element of his work is that of small suns, which developed in the use of crystals and lenses in his sculpture. The origin of this came from his time in Italy, when he saw a child capturing the reflections of the sun bouncing from puddles on the street. The sun images first appeared in his paintings, then moved onto his sculpture, where they evolved into the use of crystals and lenses to distort or sharpen the effect of light or the onlookers sight. These became the essence of many of his magiscopios. Martin Foley titled his autobiography of Béjar El recolector de soles (The gatherer of suns.) .
He stated that he wanted to “democratize beauty through art” and believed art provided a way to live in harmony. He was also bothered by the idea that art was a solemn occupation, rather considering it a “game” however not light or frivolous.
As he did not consider the arts and crafts separate, he is also noted for the making of rugs and tapestries. He also built houses, stage sets, a semi-circular Greco-Roman theaters and created a ranch to be close to nature, with gardens, water works and an orchard. His wide range of interests attracted some negative criticism for not specializing while others depreciated his work because of his frequent travels, calling him “bohemian.” His art has also been classified as “handcraft” but that did not bother him, instead took pride in it.

Wally Gacek (born c. 1927) is a former ice hockey player who was a member of the Michigan Wolverines team that won the first NCAA Frozen Four ice hockey championship in 1948. He played four years of hockey at Michigan from 1946-1949.
Junior Hockey.
Gacek grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and played for the St. James Canadians, a Winnipeg team that played in the 1944 western Canada junior hockey championship.
University of Michigan.
Gacek later enrolled at the University of Michigan. As a freshman in 1946, Gacek helped Michigan win the Big Ten Conference hockey championship by scoring the tying goal against the University of Minnesota in the season's final game. In 1948, he played for the Michigan team that won the first ever NCAA Frozen Four ice hockey championship. Four teams were selected to play in the first Frozen Four tournament, held at the Broadmoor Hotel Ice Palace in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The four teams were Michigan, Boston College, Dartmouth College, and Colorado College. The semifinal game went into overtime, and Gacek scored 18 seconds into the overtime period, and then scored again with a half minute left in overtime, as Michigan beat Boston College 6-4. In the championship game against Dartmouth, Gacek scored two goals in the first period and another in the third period to complete a hat trick, as Michigan won 8-4. Gacek starred as the center on Michigan's famous "G" line, which included Wally Grant and Ted Greer. Each of the three linemates scored a third-period goal in Michigan's championship game against Dartmouth. Gacek led all scorers in the first Frozen Four with five goals and three assists for eight points. His six points in the championship game (3 goals, 3 assists) remains the record for an NCAA championship game. Gacek and Gordon McMillan scored goals five seconds apart in the third period against Dartmouth, which also remains a record for the fastest consecutive goals by a team in the championship round. The hockey title capped off a year in which Michigan had also won the Rose Bowl and the conference basketball championship.
Awards.
Gacek was named a second-team All-American forward in 1948 and a first-team All-American in 1949. In March 1949, he was selected as Michigan's Most Valuable Player. In 2007, Gacek was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor.

Great Mosque of Raqqah

The Great Mosque of Raqqah () is the oldest mosque in ar-Raqqah, Syria, located at the northern section of the city's heart. It has a rectangular plan ( x ) with thick mud brick walls fortified with semi-circular towers at the corners. The outer walls of the mosque are constructed of mud bricks supported by solid semi-circular buttress towers. The prayer hall consisted of three arcades supported on cylindrical piers, whilst the other three sides were lined with double arcades. The building is decorated with stucco, traces of which survive.
The mosque was built by the Abbasids in 772 CE, under the reign of caliph al-Mansur. All that remains of the mosque today are the baked brick minaret () and the prayer hall ("haram") façade with eleven arches that were added by Nur ad-Din Zangi during the 1165 renovation of the mosque.

EN 1063

EN 1063, or CEN 1063, is a security glazing standard created by the European Committee for Standardization for measuring the protective strength of bullet-resistant glass. It is commonly used in conjunction with EN 1522 (Euronorm standard for Bullet Resistance in Windows, Doors, Shutters and Blinds) to form a ballistic classification system by which armored vehicles and structures are tested and rated. A similar classification system primarily used in the United States is NIJ Standard 0108, the U.S. National Institute of Justice's Standard for Ballistic Resistant Protective Materials which includes glass and armor plate.
Threat Levels.
The protective strength of a glazed shielding is rated based on the type of munitions, or threat level, it is capable of withstanding. There are 7 main standard threat levels: BR1-BR7 (also written as B1-B7), each corresponding to a different type of small arms fire. Additionally, there are two other threat levels (SG1 & SG2) corresponding to shotgun munitions.
To be given a particular rating, the glazing must stop the bullet for the specified number of strikes, with multiple strikes placed within 120mm of each other. The glazing should also be shatterproof and produce no spalls after each strike. Lastly, the classification levels are numbered in order of increasing protective strength. Thus any sample complying with the requirements of one class also complies with the requirements of previous classes. However, the SG (shotgun) classes do not necessarily comply with BR classes.
The precise test requirements and bullet types used are as follows:
LB - Lead Bullet
FJ - Full Metal Jacket
FN - Flat Nose
RN - Round Nose
CB - Cone Bullet
PB - Pointed Bullet
SC - Soft Core (lead)
SCP - Soft Core (lead) & Steel Penetrator
HC - Hard core, steel hardness > 63 HRC

Porga of Croatia

Porga, Porgas or Borko (ca. 660–680) was one of the first dukes or princes () of Littoral Croatia.
History.
De Administrando Imperio.
The "De Administrando Imperio" mentions that Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) settled the White Croats in Croatia after they had expelled the Avars, during the rule of Porga's father. He then continues that Heraclius sent priests from Rome, and appointed an archbishop, a bishop, elders and deacons of these, and baptized the Croats, which were then under the rule of "Porgas".
Modern historiography.
Croatian historian Ivo Omrčanin believed that Porga would have ruled in ca. 660–ca. 680, while his father would have ruled ca. 635–ca. 660.
H. H. Howorth in "The Spread of the Slaves" (1878) believed Porga to be the son of one of the five brothers who had left White Croatia. Howorth noted that the name was uncommon, and mentioned Schafarik who compared the name to "Purgas", which was the name of a Mordwin chief mentioned in 1229, making it possible that the Croats were subjects to alien princes, perhaps Avars. However, as Franjo Rački points out, "Porga" could also have been just an alien transcription of a rather common Slavic name, Borko.

Jorge Reyes (musician)

Jorge Reyes (September 24, 1952 – February 7, 2009) was a Mexican ambient electronic musician who incorporated elements of his native Mexican culture into his music. He performed as the member of several groups and collaborations (most notably with Steve Roach as well as Suso Saiz) and as a solo artist
The Mexican Reyes should not be confused with the Cuban bassist Jorge Reyes, the Cuban author Jorge Ivan Reyes, the Brooklyn television writer Jorge A. Reyes, or the Oregon baseball player Jorge Reyes.
History.
Reyes was born on September 24, 1952, in Uruapan, Michoacán, Mexico. He was not an indigenous person, but played many Prehispanic instruments to which he was exposed from an early age in his village. Reyes attended the National School of Music, Mexico (Escuela Nacional de Musica de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, or UNAM) 1970–1975, studying the flute. During this time, he formed two seminal Mexican rock bands, Al Universo and Nuevo México, influenced by Jethro Tull and Pink Floyd but incorporating native musical instruments. In 1976, his growing interest in jazz led to spending a year in Hamburg, Germany, where he studied improvisation with Herb Geller. As part of this training, he traveled through Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka. In 1978, he attended a Hindu music course in the Himalayas, in which he studied traditional Indian flute and percussion techniques. On these overseas trips, he began collecting many native instruments.
After returning to Mexico, Reyes founded the band Chac Mool with drummer Armando Suárez and keyboardist Carlos Alvarado, which was one of the first Mexican progressive rock bands. The band recorded four well-received albums, on which Reyes played flute and guitar, before disbanding.
In 1985, Reyes began a prolific solo career. He collaborated with several other new-age and electronic musicians, including American synthesist Steve Roach, Mexican singer and multi-instrumentalist Arturo Meza (of the band Decibel), Spanish guitarist Suso Saiz, Mexican percussionist Juan Carlos López, German synthesist Elmar Schulte (of the band Solitaire), Deep Forest, and others.
His music was used frequently in Mexican radio and television programs. He performed many concerts at famous Mexican archeological sites such as Malinalco, Teotihuacan, Templo Mayor, Chichen Itza, and Tenango del Valle. His annual Día de los Muertos concerts at UNAM were popular events. He also gave many concerts at the Espacio Escultórico de Ciudad Universitaria, where he collaborated with dancer and choreographer Regina Quintero.
Reyes died from a heart attack at his recording studio in Mexico City on Saturday February 7, 2009. He was 56 years old. He had three children—Citlalli, Ridwan (with Ursula Kipp), and Erendira (with Ariane Pellicer).

Sébastien Corchia

Sébastien Corchia (born 1 November 1990) is a French footballer who plays for French club Lille in Ligue 1.He is a French youth international having represented his nation at under-17, under-18, and under-19 and plays on the under-21 team. Corchia, due to his French and Italian ancestry, holds dual nationality.
Club career.
Early career.
Corchia was born in the Parisian suburb of Noisy-le-Sec and started his career with hometown club Stade Olympique de Rosny-sous-Bois Football. After a two-year stint at the club, he joined semi-professional outfit Villemomble Sports. Corchia spent five years at the club, and in 2003, was selected to attend the prestigious Clairefontaine academy. While training at Clairefontaine during the week, Corchia played with amateur club AS Bondy on the weekends. Shortly before the end of his tenure at Clairefontaine, he also trained at the Camp des Loges, the youth training center of Paris Saint-Germain.
Le Mans.
After his departure from the academy, Corchia joined Le Mans on an "aspirant" (youth) contract. His performances with Le Mans's Championnat de France amateur team and France's international youth teams led to interest from Serie A club Juventus and Premier league club Arsenal. Corchia remained in Le Mans's youth system until receiving his first call up to the senior squad on 14 February 2009 for the team's league match against Nice. He started the match playing 68 minutes before being substituted out. Le Mans lost the match 2–1 with both goals being scored with Corchia off the pitch. The following week, he earned another start against Marseille where he went up against the likes of Mathieu Valbuena, Bolo Zenden, and Hatem Ben Arfa. This was where he had started gaining his reputation. Towards the end of the season, Corchia became the first choice starting all ten matches he appeared in. 
The 2008 winter transfer window, it is tracked by Juventus.But he finally extends Mans . The end of the season is excellent, so much so that many believe media already see him as a "great" future.[3 In MUC, it is advised by the experienced Paulo André, before it goes back not to the country.
On 1 May 2009, Corchia agreed to his first professional contract signing with Le Mans until June 2012. For the 2009–10 season, new manager Paulo Duarte installed Corchia as the first-choice right back for the season. On 12 December, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 victory over Valenciennes. In the return fixture against Valenciennes, Corchia scored his second career goal converting a free kick in injury time. The game-winning goal helped Le Mans remain in contention to stay in Ligue 1, though the team was later relegated.
Sochaux.
On 30 June 2011, after spending a season playing with Le Mans in the second division, Corchia returned to Ligue 1 joining Sochaux on a four-year contract. The transfer fee was undisclosed. Corchia made his competitive debut for the club in its opening league match of the season against Marseille. In the match, he assisted on the team's opening goal scored by Marvin Martin. The match finished in a 2–2 draw. Sébastien Corchia's first goal came in an away match against Rennes on 23 February 13.
On 29 January 2014, he signed with Lille OSC with a four-and-a-half-year contract. However, his contract was not officially recognized by the French financial authority in football, due to Lille's financial difficulties, and so he returned to Sochaux.
Lille.
On 27 June 2014, Corchia finally joined Lille on a four-year deal after Sochaux had been relegated in the 2013–14 season.
International career.
Sébastien is a French youth international. He has played on the under-17, under-18, and the under-19 team. With the under-17 team, Corchia made his debut in a 2–1 friendly defeat to the Czech Republic appearing as a substitute in the second half for Julien Berthomier. His only other appearance with the team was the return match against the Czech Republic, which ended 1–1. Corchia was a late participant with the under-18 team making his debut in the Slovakia Cup on 28 April 2008 against the hosts. He appeared in all three group stage matches, which is where France suffered elimination.
Corchia was a key participant in the under-19 team that qualified for the 2009 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship and was named to the tournament playing the full 90 minutes in the squad's opening 1–1 draw with Serbia. He played in all four of the squad's matches including the semi-final, where they suffered elimination losing 1–3 in extra time to England with Corchia receiving a red card. He appeared in all 19 matches the team contested. Corchia is also eligible to represent the country of his father's ancestors, Italy.

Rochelle Park-Rochelle Heights Historic District

The Rochelle Park-Rochelle Heights Historic District is a historic residential district located in the city of New Rochelle in Westchester, New York. The district is historically and architecturally significant as an intact and distinctive example of residential park development at the turn of the Twentieth Century. It includes the historic Rochelle Park development, and the later Rochelle Heights subdivision. Within the district are 555 contributing properties, including 513 buildings, 38 structures, and 4 sites. Only 24 buildings and 1 site separately identified within its area are non-contributing. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on July 6, 2005.
The two neighborhoods, combined into one historic district in 1986, reflect the history of suburban design from 1885 when the phenomenon first took hold in Westchester, the first large suburban area in the world to develop, to the 1920s when the automobile and Progressive Era ideas of planning and architecture were coming into favor. The landscape and house architecture of the area remains remarkably intact and provide valuable information about the range of innovative planning principles that were applied there.
Rochelle Park.
Laid out in 1885, Rochelle Park is particularly distinguished as the America's third planned residential community, preceded only by Tuxedo Park in New York and Llewellyn Park in Pennsylvania. Its overall landscape plan was designed by the architect Nathan Franklin Barrett for the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Rochelle Park epitomizes the suburban development design principles that Frederick Law Olmsted advocated with the creation of Central Park in New York City: a landscape that provides urban dwellers with the restorative benefits of a picturesque natural environment. Incorporating open space, recreational areas, naturalistic settings, and broad boulevards for public interaction. The architecture of the homes is equally impressive, with many fashionable Queen Anne, shingle, and colonial revival style "cottages" designed with tall towers and attic porches to take advantage of the views towards Long Island Sound located a mile away.
Rochelle Park is essentially rectangular in dimension, with the southeast corner having been clipped from it by the construction of the New York & New Haven Railroad in the 1850s. In the original plan, the parcel was diagonally divided by a wide boulevard (The Boulevard) that entered the park at a stone gateway and ended at a circle ("The Court"). The Boulevard was intended to continue east through a tunnel under the railroad tracks and south to Long Island Sound. This planned connection gave the park the cachet of water access even though the development was a good distance away. This amenity lasted a very short time due to additional subdivisions of the property and the elimination of right-of-way.
Despite the setbacks from Barrett's original designs, The Boulevard continued to remain one of the most unusual aspects of the community's landscape. At 100 feet wide, The Boulevard allowed for an abundance of green space and deep set-backs for the houses. The scale and design of the Boulevard reflected Barrett's taste for formal landscape elements that anticipated the City Beautiful Movement. The broad vista created by the Boulevard is intersected in two places by the Serpentine, a roadway that meanders within a rough, rocky section of the landscape. The terrain made a continuous grid plan difficult, thus presenting Barrett with an opportunity to design a more interesting landscape.
Rochelle Heights.
The plan for Rochelle Heights is organized around a promontory in the northeastern part of the subdivision that was set aside for large houses with the status of water views. As the plan descended from this highpoint, a hierarchy of lots and architecture is shown in a secondary group encircling the hill. The properties at the outer limits of the development are more closely arranged in a tight pattern with detached houses intended for a middle-class clientele. The latter properties provided a buffer against the more random development outside the district and protected the neighborhood's exclusive environment within.
Rochelle Heights was laid out in a number of phases beginning in 1905 by New York architects Mann, MacNellie and Lindeberg. Its landscape design is more efficient than Rochelle Park, reflecting its later period of development. The architecture of Rochelle Heights does not have the same uniformity as Rochelle Park but rather, reflects the diversity of scale and style found in suburban architecture in the early twentieth century, including Queen Anne, shingle, tudor revival, and colonial revival. The planners laid out large expansive lots on the southerly side of Cortlandt Avenue where buyers would have views of Long Island Sound. Realizing this, naming the subdivision the "heights" had a certain legitimacy. Tudor Revival, Italian Renaissance and Colonial Revival designs were popular in this collection of homes which was viewed as the highest echelon of the development. 
The streets at the outer boundaries of Rochelle Heights contain smaller lots. These streets frame the core of the development and buffer the interior properties. Although these tertiary streets were lesser properties in the context of the Rochelle Heights development, they were still above the mean and intended for a middle-class clientele.
These two neighborhoods, combined into one historic district in 1986, reflect the history of suburban design since 1885 when the phenomenon first took hold in the United States.

Kayla Stra (born 3 December 1984 in Adelaide, South Australia) is a jockey and television personality in Thoroughbred horse racing who raced in Australia until coming to compete in the United States at racetracks in California. She currently rides in the Northern California circuit after a 2 year stint in the Southern California area. She is also known for her appearances on the reality tv show, Jockeys on Animal Planet.
Kayla Stra was born in Australia, where she launched her career in horseracing prior to moving to California in Late 2007. From a very young age, Stra was interested in horses, having talked her parents into buying her a pony when she was eight years old. During her late childhood and adolescence, Stra worked at racing stables and eventually bought her first horse — a Thoroughbred named Gurtie, which she trained on her own for picnic races (unregistered race horses) before getting her certificate in racing.
Stra acknowledges her first trainer, Ray Moore, as someone who has had a strong influence in her life. Moore taught Stra how to be a horseman — how to communicate with horses by reading their body language and having a keen feel for what they're thinking. Stra credits John Letts as one of her mentors for his outstanding jockey career, having won three Melbourne Cups and hundreds upon hundreds of stake races.
As an apprentice, Stra was always in the top five riders and won all her premierships. During this time, she began traveling to different tracks to learn more from those experiences.
Stra eventually racked up approximately 500 victories in her native country and became the "poster girl" for Australian horseracing. Now, she hopes to continue that success in the much larger US market. Racing in California, on 9 November 2007 Kayla Stra won her first American race aboard Flying Bearcat at Hollywood Park Racetrack. One notable victory was at Santa Anita on 49-1 longshot Paddin' Mud. In addition, Kayla scored an opening day victory at Del Mar with King Ledley, and then scored another victory aboard the same horse within three weeks. King Ledley is owned by Racing Capital Group, LLC, which is a race horse syndication company who primarily uses Kayla as their jockey. Racing Capital Group's web site is racingcapitalgroup.com., where she is their featured jockey. Stra's career goal to date is to hang in the game and not let the industry down. But here, she will face the toughest competitors in the world — serious professional athletes who are not likely to cut any slack for the new girl.
Stra became a leading Adelaide apprentice jockey who posted 220 winners in Australia. Her biggest Australian win was in the 2005 City of Marion Stakes with gelding Navy Shaker.
Stra was one of the jockeys featured in Animal Planet's 2009 reality tv show, Jockeys. It lasted for two seasons.
Stra returned to professional horse racing in January, 2013, after the birth of her son, Brys Headley in November, 2012. Soon after her return to racing, a steward banned her from the Betfair Hollywood Park jockeys' room for breastfeeding her son. One of the stewards had allegedly told Stra's agent that she needed to decide whether she was going to focus on caring for her child or her profession. California Horse Racing Board chairman David Israel overruled the steward, stating "Kayla Stra's baby can be in the jocks' room. Her nanny can be with the baby. And both the mother and the nanny can do all the things they need to do."
