Rajinder Sachar

Rajindar Sachar (born 22 December 1923) is an Indian lawyer and a former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court.
He was a member of United Nations Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.
He has served as a counsel for the People's Union for Civil Liberties.
He chaired the Sachar Committee, constituted by the Government of India, which submitted a much debated report on the social, economic and educational status of Muslims in India.
On 16 August 2011 Sachar was arrested in New Delhi during protests over the detention of Anna Hazare and his supporters.
Early years.
Rajindar Sachar was born on 22 December 1923.
His father was Bhim Sen Sachar.
His grandfather was a well-known criminal lawyer in Lahore, in what is now the Pakistani province of Punjab, in the days before independence and partition.
He attended the D.A.V. High School in Lahore, then went on to Government College Lahore and Law College, Lahore.
On 22 April 1952 Sachar enrolled as an advocate at Simla. On 8 December 1960 he became an advocate in the Supreme Court of India,
engaging in a wide variety of cases concerning civil, criminal and revenue issues.
In 1963 a breakaway group of legislators left the Congress party and formed the independent "Prajatantra Party".
Sachar helped this group prepare memoranda levelling charges of corruption and mal-administration against Pratap Singh Kairon, Chief Minister of the Indian state of Punjab. Justice Sudhi Ranjan Das was appointed to look into the charges, and in June 1964 found Kairon guity on eight counts.
Judge.
On 12 February 1970 Sachar was appointed Additional Judge of the Delhi High Court for a two-year term, and on 12 February 1972 he was reappointed for another two years.
On 5 July 1972 he was appointed a permanent judge of the high court. 
He was acting chief justice of the Sikkim High court from 16 May 1975 until 10 May 1976, when he was made a judge in the Rajasthan High Court. 
The transfer from Sikkim to Rajasthan was made without Sachar's consent during the Emergency (June 1975 – March 1977) when elections and civil liberties were suspended.
Sachar was one of the judges that refused to follow the bidding of the Emergency establishment, and who were transferred as a form of punishment.
After the restoral of democracy, on 9 July 1977 he was transferred back to the Delhi High Court.
In June 1977 Justice Sachar was appointed by the government to chair a committee that reviewed the Companies Act and the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, submitting an encyclopaedic report on the subject in August 1978.
Sachar's committee recommended a major overhaul of the corporate reporting system, and particularly of the approach to reporting on social impacts.
In May 1984 Sachar reviewed the Industrial Disputes Act, including the backlog of cases.
His report was scathing. He said "A more horrendous and despairing situation can hardly be imagined... the load at present in the various Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals is so disproportionate to what can conceivably be borne ... that the arrears can only go on increasing if the present state of affairs is not improved... It is harsh and unjust to both the employers and employees if the cases continue to remain undecided for years".
Sachar was Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court from 6 August 1985 until his retirement on 22 December 1985.
Later career.
Civil liberties.
Sachar was one of the authors of a report issued on 22 April 1990 on behalf of the People's Union for Civil Liberties and others entitled ""Report on Kashmir Situation"".
In January 1992 Sachar was one of the signatories to an appeal to all Punjabis asking them to ensure that the forthcoming elections were free and were seen to be free. They asked the people to ensure there was no violence, cooercion or unfair practices that would prevent the people from electing the government of their choice.
Sachar was appointed to a high-level Advisory Committee chaired by Chief Justice Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi to review the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 and determine whether structural changes and amendments were needed. The committee prepared a draft amendment Bill incorporating its recommendations. These included changes to the membership of the National Human Rights Commission, changes to procedures to reduce delays in following up recommendations and a broadening of the commission's scope. The recommendations were submitted the Home Affairs ministry on 7 March 2000.
In April 2003, as council for the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Sachar argued before the Supreme Court of India that the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act (POTA) should be quashed since it violated fundamental rights.
On 24 November 2002 the police arrested twenty six people in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, and on 10 January 2003 they were placed under POTA by the government on the grounds that they were members of the Radical Youth League of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist). On 26 August 2004, still being held without trial, the detainees began a hunger strike. Sachar led a team of human rights activists who visited them in jail on 15 September 2004 and persuaded them to end the hunger strike.
POTA was repealed on 10 November 2004. 
However, all the POTA provisions were incorporated in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In October 2009 Sachar called for abolition of these laws. He said "Terrorism is there, I admit, but in the name of terror probe, many innocent people are taken into custody without registering a charge and are being detained for long period".
Housing rights.
Sachar, who had formerly been a United Nations special rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, headed a mission that investigated housing rights in Kenya for the Housing and Land Rights Committee of the Habitat International Coalition.
In its report issued in March 2000 the mission found that the Kenyan government had failed to meet its international obligations regarding protection of its citizens' housing rights.
The report described misallocation of public land, evictions and land-grabbing by corrupt politicians and bureaucrats.
Rajindra Sachar participated with retired justices Hosbet Suresh and Siraj Mehfuz Daud in an investigation by the Indian People's Human Rights Tribunal into a massive slum clearance drive in Mumbai, which had the ostensible purpose of preserving the Sanjay Gandhi National Park.
The demolitions on 22–23 January 2000 had been undertaken despite a notification from the state government to stay demolitions until September.
The people had not been allowed to take the remains of their homes, which had been burnt.
Sachar described the scene as "Barbaric, savage. It's as if a bomb has fallen here".
In August 2000 the judges, joined by former Supreme Court judge V. R. Krishna Iyer, held a two-day hearing into the clearances in which about 60,000 people had been evicted.
The inquiry covered both legal aspects of the clearances and the human impact.
Sachar headed a People's Court in 2002 to deliberate on people affected by evictions required to widen the Beliaghata Circular Canal in Kolkata, needed for health and safety purposes. Most of the people were poor handcart pullers, maidservants, hawkers and so on. The court called for consultation with the affected people as part of the project's decision-making process. They should be treated humanely, without force or coercion, and should not be evicted during periods of bad weather.
Sachar committee.
In March 2005 Justice Rajinder Sachar was appointed to a committee to study the condition of the Muslim community in India and to prepare a comprehensive report on their social, economic and educational status.
On 17 November 2006 he presented the report, entitled ""Report on Social, Economic and Educational Status of the Muslim Community of India"", to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
The report showed the growing social and economic insecurity that had been imposed on Muslims since independence sixty years earlier.
It found that the Muslim population, estimated at over 138 million in 2001, were under-represented in the civil service, police, military and in politics. 
Muslims were more likely to be poor, illiterate, unhealthy and to have trouble with the law than other Indians. 
Muslims were accused of being against the Indian state, of being terrorists, and politicians who tried to help them risked being accused of "appeasing" them.
The Sachar Committee recommendations aimed to promote inclusion of the diverse communities in India and their equal treatment. It emphasised initiatives that were general rather than specific to any one community. It was a landmark in the debate on the Muslim question in India.
The speed of implementation would naturally depend on political factors including the extent of backlash from Hindutva groups.
The Sachar Committee Report recommended setting up an institutional structure for an Equal Opportunity Commission. 
An expert group was established that presented a report, including a draft bill to establish such a commission, in February 2008.
There was opposition. Thus, a speaker at a seminar in April 2008 sponsored by a group called "Bharatiya Vichar Manch" described the report as unconstitutional, saying "It should be rejected completely. It is on communal lines and will divide the country. It is a result of vote bank politics".
Other activities.
In 2003, as counsel for the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), Sachar and Prashant Bhushan challenged the government's plans to privatise Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. CPIL said that the only way to disinvest in the companies would be to repeal or amend the Acts by which they were nationalised in the 1970s.
In December 2009 it was reported that Sachar was being proposed as Governor of West Bengal to replace Gopalkrishna Gandhi, whose term had expired.
In the event, Devanand Konwar was appointed acting governor.
At the age of eighty-seven Sachar was detained by Delhi Police on 16 August 2011 during the India Against Corruption protest. The arrest was for unlawful assembly and for making speeches in a location where a magistrate had declared the Section 144 rules were in force. Sachar claimed that he knew the law and should not be arrested, but despite this he was taken into custody.
Miscellaneous statements.
The 1978 Sachar report on the Companies and MRTP acts said: "The racket of inter-corporate investment has led to widespread sickness in the industry for the sake of building industrial empire. I feel that the inter-corporate investment should be banned".
In 1989–1990 the Central Bureau of Investigation launched an inquiry into kickbacks in a government gun purchase deal. The inquiry was abandoned after the V. P. Singh government fell. Sachar called for the 500 pages of documents collected during the inquiry to be made public, saying: "There is no reason why the public should not be told of the full contents of the Bofors papers and only delay in disclosing the contents will unnecessarily expose the government to the charge of political manipulation".
He said in 1992: "... the bureaucracy deviates from rules in the hope of basking in political favour. But this is short-term approach. Soon, the bureaucracy will find that after the massive ego and power lust of the politicians are satisfied, there comes a day when the bureaucrat is at the receiving end. And there is no one to support him because in league with politicians he has destroyed the strength of the public opinion. Bureaucrat is an unruly horse but has the potential to win the Derby, provided the Jockey is the expert, capable of giving proper motivation and desired direction. Politician with Bureaucratic mould of course, would do better,".
In March 2003 Sachar was a signatory to a statement that condemned the US-led invasion of Iraq, calling it "unprovoked, unjustified and violative of international law and the United Nations Charter". Other signatories included Shanti Bhushan, Pavani Parameswara Rao, Rajeev Dhavan, Kapil Sibal and Prashant Bhushan.
Commenting on the rise of crime against women, Sachar has stated that reservations for women in parliament could help eliminate gender bias in legal cases. He said "Gender injustice means violation of human rights of an individual which are sacred".
He has said "There are about 200 OBC candidates in the Lok Sabha. It is not their public service, but merely the caste configuration that has preferred them. Similar results will follow even after the reservation for women".
Sachar has said: "I have deep faith in the judiciary ... like any other institution the judiciary may not have come up to the expectation; but that does not mean that the entire judiciary should be accused".
However, he has also spoken in favour of a national Judicial Commission, including members other than lawyers and judges, that would investigate issues concerning the administration of justice including the conduct of judges.
In 2003 he said: "There is an insistent public demand now that matters connected with appointments and misdemeanours of the higher judiciary need to be dealt with by an independent body using transparent means instead of the present unsatisfactory mechanism shrouded in secrecy".
Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code outlaws disaffection against the state, and allows for penalties of life imprisonment.
Jawaharlal Nehru told the Indian parliament in 1951 that "the sooner we get rid of it the better".
In January 2012 Rajinder Sachar said "It seems tragic that we should be asking the government to redeem the pledge of Nehru. For having a democratic society, it is necessary that these laws go".

Nathaniel Buchanan

Nathaniel Buchanan (1826 – 23 September 1901) was an Australian pioneer pastoralist, drover and explorer.
Early life.
Buchanan was born near Dublin, and was of Scottish descent the son of Lieutenant Charles Henry Buchanan, and his wife Annie, "née" White. He arrived in New South Wales with his parents in 1832, and as a young man was part owner with two brothers of Bald Blair station. In 1850 the brothers went to the California Gold Rush, but returned to Australia after a short stay to find that their station had been mismanaged and lost in their absence. During the next few years Buchanan had much experience of overlanding.
Career.
In 1859 Buchanan explored new country with William Landsborough, principally on the tributaries of the Fitzroy River, Queensland, when both suffered many privations and were found just in time by a rescue party. Buchanan then joined Landsborough and others as owners of Bowen Downs Station near Longreach, Queensland, which for a time prospered. However, a time came when cattle were almost unsaleable, and the price of wool dropped so low that the station had to be given up and Buchanan was practically penniless. 
Buchanan made several explorations inland from Bowen Downs, including securing land near Burketown, Queensland.
In October 1877, with a companion, Sam Croker, Buchanan began to investigate the country from the known regions round the Rankine to the overland telegraph line, around 500 miles (800 km) away. They discovered much good new land, part of the Barkly Tableland, and has since carried some of the largest herds in Australia. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s Buchanan did a large amount of pioneering, working principally in northern Queensland and the Northern Territory. Buchanan was also noted for his overlanding feats including droving 20,000 head of cattle from Queensland to Glencoe Station. He had another property, Wave Hill, for a period, but he lost this in 1894 on account of a great fall in cattle prices and the difficulty in getting markets. His son, Gordon Buchanan, had taken up land at Flora valley in 1887 and Buchanan now established this as his headquarters. About two years later, with another man and an aboriginal boy, he started with camels and equipment provided by the South Australian government to find a stock route from northern Queensland. He went from Oodnadatta up the line to Tennant Creek, and then westward to Sturt's Creek. About 40 miles (64 km) from Hooker's Creek he sighted the hills now named Buchanan Hills, and next day came to a branch of Hooker's Creek. Then he went to Hale's Creek and the Sturt, and then to Flora valley. Attempts were made to find a practicable stock route to the west with no success. Returning to Flora Creek he prepared a report for the South Australian government which added much to the knowledge of the country, though Buchanan had failed in his main object. In 1899 Buchanan, now 73 years of age, bought a farm on Dungowan Creek, 22 miles from Tamworth and he died there in 1901 still working. Nat was buried in the general cemetery at Walcha, New South Wales. He married in 1863 Catherine Gordon who survived him, along with a son.
Legacy.
Buchanan was a great bushman and a good explorer. He knew the country from northern Queensland to Western Australia very well. He rarely made much money for himself though he was a pioneer on Bowen Downs, on the Barkly Tableland, on the Roper River, and on the Victoria River, and pioneered the trail from the Kimberleys towards Perth. When he died, he owned almost no land, but he made possibilities for other men who in many cases reaped where he had sown. His brother William had also been a significant pastoralist pioneer.

Democratic Republicans (Italy)

The Democratic Republicans ("Repubblicani Democratici", RD) were a tiny liberal political party in Italy. Their leader was Giuseppe Ossorio. 
The party was founded in 2004 by splinters from the Italian Republican Party (PRI), who wanted to get rid of the alliance with the centre-right House of Freedoms coalition.
At the 2005 regional elections the party presented its list only in Campania, where it gained 1.4% and Ossorio was re-elected to the Regional Council.
In 2005 the party sided with The Union and contested the 2006 general election within the lists of Antonio Di Pietro's Italy of Values (IdV). Consequently to this pact of federation, Ossorio was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in his home region Campania and sit in the IdV caucus.
On 20 September 2007, Ossorio announced that the Democratic Republicans were joining the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) alongside with fellow ex-PRI members of the European Republicans Movement (MRE). In 2010, however, the party returned into the PRI's fold.

<doc id="9730146" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9730146" title="Nocton Hall">
Nocton Hall

Nocton Hall is a historic Grade II listed building in the village of Nocton, in Lincolnshire, England. The plaque on the north face of the Hall (see below) indicates that the original building dates back to about 1530 but since then there have been two notable reconstructions. Several prominent people have been residents of the house the most notable being Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for a short time.
During the First World War the house was used as a convalescence home for wounded American Officers. In the Second World War the Americans again used the house as a military hospital after which it was taken over by the RAF and an extensive hospital developed in the grounds. It reverted to private use in the 1980s. In 2004 there was a major fire which left the building in a derelict state. Options are currently being considered regarding the future of the building.
Early history.
The historic grounds upon which Nocton Hall stands previously contained both a house and priory. Nocton Priory was built in the 12th century and the house was constructed in the 16th century and coexisted with the priory. The remains of the priory still exist as earthworks and are located at least from the house. The house was called Nocton Manor and was the property of Thomas Wimbishe and subsequently the Towneley family. This house was reconstructed by Sir William Ellis in the latter part of the 17th-century by extending parts of the existing Towneley manor and was called Nocton Old Hall. In 1834 Nocton Old Hall was engulfed by fire and the current building was erected in 1841 by the 1st Earl of Ripon.
In 1996 before the recent fire an examination of the house was made and some evidence was found that the 1841 building contained some parts of Nocton Old Hall. There is a plaque on the Northern Elevation of the building near the front door (shown on the right) which indicates that the Earl and Countess of Ripon who reconstructed the current building in 1841 believed that it was actually founded in about 1530. The plaque which is in Latin reads when translated.
Nocton Hall, then the property of Thomas Wimbishe, was visited by Henry VIII and Catherine Howard in 1541 during the King's 'northern progress. Henry's fifth wife, Catherine, reputedly planted the great chestnut tree in the grounds at Nocton on 13 October 1541. The tree still stands today.
Frederick and Sarah Robinson, 1st Earl and Countess of Ripon.
Frederick John Robinson was born in 1782. His parents were Thomas Robinson 2nd Baron Grantham and Lady Mary daughter of the 2nd Earl of Hardwicke. He was educated at Harrow and Cambridge University and was regarded as a very bright student.
Sarah, his wife was born in 1793 and was eleven years his junior. She was the only child of Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire who owned Nocton Old Hall. On his death in 1816 she inherited his property.
Frederick became Tory M.P. for Carlow borough in 1806 and for Ripon in 1807-27. He was secretary of state for the colonies in 1809, Lord of the Admiralty 1810-12, Privy Councillor in 1812, a Lord of the Treasury in 1812, Paymaster-General of the forces in 1812-17 and Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1823-27.
In 1827 he became Prime Minister after the death of Canning. He was appointed by the King who thought that because of his previous experience and competent performance he would be suitable. However this was not the case and only five months later with his Government in chaos he was asked to resign.
History has judged Frederick harshly because of this episode but there were very severe pressures on him at the time. There was a high level of discord between members of his own party which he found difficult to control. There was also a great deal of domestic pressure on him at the time which he found unbearable. His wife Sarah had proved to be an unsuitable partner for a high ranking politician as she was prone to outburst of hysteria and hypochondria. There exists letters written by Sarah’s aunt Emily Eden which frequently describes her niece’s strange behaviour. In 1826 she said.
The aunt also felt that Frederick had a nervous disposition and was completely dominated by the hysterical behaviour of his wife. It is these character traits that may have made him such an unsuitable Prime Minister even though he was a competent politician in lower offices. After he resigned from the Prime Ministerial Office one of his colleagues remarked that he was “quite another man who sleeps at nights now, and laughs and talks as usual.
The couple had only one child who survived to adulthood. This was George Frederick Samuel Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon and upon Frederick’s death in 1859 he inherited Nocton Hall.
George and Henrietta Robinson, 1st Marquess and Marchioness of Ripon.
George Frederick Samuel Robinson was born in 1827 in 10 Downing Street when his father was Prime Minister. A large part of his childhood was spent at Nocton Hall where he obtained much of his education. He was a prolific reader which helped him obtain the knowledge he required.
In 1851 he married Henrietta Vyner who was a distant cousin. Henrietta was the daughter of Captain Henry Vyner of Newby Hall near Ripon.
In 1859 after his father’s death he succeeded the title of Earl of Ripon. In November of the same year he gained the title of his uncle, Earl de Grey as his uncle had no male heirs. He also inherited from Earl de Grey his ancestral home of Studley Royal in Yorkshire.
He was undersecretary for war in 1859–61 and for India in 1861–63. He became Prime Minister Lord Palmerston’s secretary for war in 1863, and in 1866 was appointed secretary of state for India.
One of his most important position was as Viceroy of India in 1880 where he is said to have introduced liberal reforms. According to one historical account:
“He lit the torch that led ultimately to the political autonomy of the country". According to the Quarterly Review Ripon had industriously scattered the germs of independence in India with the doctrine that "the natives were entitled to rule, the English nothing more than interlopers; the time had arrived when India was entitled to ‘Home Rule’.
After he returned from India he spent more of his time at his other home Studley Royal and he decided to sell Nocton Hall in 1889. The buyer was a close friend of his George Hodgson, a very wealthy industrialist.
Residents of Nocton Hall after the Robinsons.
George Hodgson, a wealthy spinner from Bradford moved into the Hall in 1889 and remained there until his death in 1895. His son John inherited the property and in 1902 upon John’s death his grandson Norman took control of the Estate.
In 1917 after the United States' entry into the War the Hodgson family moved into Embsay House in the village, so that the Hall could be turned into a convalescent home for American officers wounded in the War. The last of these officers left in 1919.
In 1919 the Hall was sold to William Dennis of the firm Messrs W.H. Dennis and Sons, Kirton. On his death in 1925 his son James Herbert Dennis came to live at the property. James was a farmer and he converted a large part of the Estate to growing potatoes. He even had a special steam locomotive manufactured for the haulage of his potatoes.
In 1940 with the outbreak of the Second World War it was originally taken over by the Army and was the home of 21st Casualty Clearing Station (CCS) RAMC until it was deployed in North Africa in June 1942. Sometime after this it was taken over by the Air Ministry, the Hall and grounds remaining as the site of an RAF hospital until its closure in 1983.
In the mid 1980s Torrie Richardson bought Nocton Hall, the surrounding wood, woodland, grassland and cottages. Selling the cottages on for redevelopment allowed him to develop Nocton Hall as a Residential Home. Nocton Hall Residential home ran a summer fête for the village on their lawn and employed many local people. Torrie's son, Gary, took control of the business in the early 1990s. The home ran into difficulty and closed in the mid 1990s, and was sold by the receivers to new owners, Leda Properties of Oxford. Leda also bought the RAF Hospital site from the Ministry of Defence.
While vacant there were many break-ins; fireplaces and the stair bannisters were stolen. It burnt down for a second time in the early hours of 24 October 2004, the fire reducing it to a shell. The investigation into the fire established that multiple fires had been set, but to date no one has been charged with arson. Due to the extensive structural damage it will now likely need to be rebuilt, if the site is not redeveloped for another purpose. An adjacent geriatric nursing care two story building has also been severely damaged by vandals since it was left vacant.
In October 2009 Nocton Hall was listed in The Victorian Society top 10 endangered buildings list in England and Wales. During the subsequent BBC Look North investigation it came to light that Leda Properties intended to put forward new development plans in 'the near future' for both the adjacent former RAF Hospital, Nocton Hall and associated gardens. As the Hall is Grade II listed and retains its major structural integrity the Society believes there is still a viable future for the building. Enthusiasts are currently campaigning at a local and national level to ensure immediate steps are taken to stabilise the structure and prevent further damage from the elements.

The Suebian knot () is a historical male hairstyle ascribed to the tribe of the Germanic Suebi. The knot is attested by Tacitus in his 1st century CE work "Germania", found on art by and depictions of the Germanic peoples, and worn by bog bodies.
"Germania".
According to "Germania" by Tacitus, the Suebian warriors combed their hair back or sideways and tied it into a knot, allegedly with the purpose of appearing taller and more awe-inspiring on the battlefield. Tacitus also reports that the fashion had spread to neighboring Germanic tribes among the younger warriors, while among the Suebians, the knot was sported even by old men as a status symbol, which "distinguishes the freeman from the slave", with the most artful knots worn by the most wealthy nobles. 
Archaeological record.
Suebian knots were found to be worn by a number of bog bodies:
In 2000 at the Baltic Sea coast at Czarnowko near Lębork, Poland, a bronze kettle was found depicting males wearing the Suebian knot hairstyle.
Depictions.
Historical depictions are found on the Trajan column, the cauldron of Musov, the Tropaeum Traiani relief, and a bronze sculpture of a kneeling German in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.

Fly mask

A fly mask or fly cap is a mask used on horses to cover the eyes, jaw, and sometimes the ears and muzzle to protect from flies. The mask is semi-transparent and made from a mesh allowing the horse to see and hear while wearing it. The mask may also provide some protection from UV-light. Fly and mosquito protection is an important part of overall horse care, as biting insects are both a source of irritation and also may transmit disease.
Most masks are made of black or white mesh, though some are colored, plaid or have silkscreened designs on them that do not interfere with vision. Fly masks are adjusted to cover the upper head and stop about halfway down the face, but the placement of stitched darts prevents the mask from rubbing on the eyes. Most have fleece padding around the muzzle and other sensitive areas. Masks come both with and without covers for the ears. Some designs have an extended flap that covers the muzzle but does not go around the lower jaw or interfere with grazing. Most attach with velcro, but a few high-end designs made with mesh and stretch lycra need to incorporate zippers instead.
A standard fly mask is not generally used while riding, as the stiff mesh interferes with the bridle and the minimal visual impairment of the mesh presents a safety issue. Other styles of insect protection gear are designed for use with a bridle. One design is a crochet-like "bonnet" for the ears only, designed to be worn under a bridle without rubbing. The other is a soft, very fine mesh face and nose-covering mask designed to be worn with a bridle and not impair vision, but not sturdy enough to withstand turnout.
It is generally recommended that the mask be removed and inspected daily and washed frequently. Some individuals remove the mask at night.
The appearance of fly masks often raises concerns among non-horse owners, as it appears that the horse has been blindfolded. However even a durable mesh is fine enough for the horse to see through. Some masks have sunglasses or cartoon eyeballs silkscreened on them to help passers-by understand their purpose.

Benjamin Truman

Sir Benjamin Truman (1699/1700 – 20 March 1780) was a notable English entrepreneur and brewer during the 18th century. He is notable for the expansion of the Truman Brewery in the Spitalfields area of east London.
Biography.
Truman followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, both named Joseph Truman. Joseph Truman the elder inherited the Lolsworth Field brewery, William Bucknall's Brewhouse, in 1694, and took his son into partnership in 1716 before dying in 1719. Benjamin Truman joined the firm in 1722, and proved himself a shrewd businessman:
Under Truman's management, the Black Eagle brewery increased substantially in prosperity and size, and Truman divided his time between the brewery's Directors' House and a home, Popes, in Hertfordshire.
Truman was knighted by George III on his accession in 1760 in recognition of his loyalty in contributing to the voluntary loans raised to carry on the various foreign wars. His portrait was painted by George Romney and Sir Thomas Gainsborough (c. 1773-1774); the latter has been part of the Tate Gallery collection since 1978.
Truman died on 20 March 1780, and left a daughter, his only child, whose two grandsons (Sir Benjamin's great-grandchildren), John Freeman Villebois and Henry Villebois, succeeded to his interest in the business.
Truman was buried in the Churchyard of St Mary's, Hertingfordbury, Hertfordshire. Together with his memorial is that of his wife Dame Frances Truman who died 10 June 1766 aged 66 and James Truman Esq., died 11 November 1766 aged 42.
Trivia.
Truman's image was used on beer labels and in advertising until the 1970s, depicting him as a jolly fat man with a peg leg and the motto “There’s more hops in Ben Truman”.

Spherical design

A spherical design, part of combinatorial design theory in mathematics, is a finite set of "N" points on the "d"-dimensional unit hypersphere "Sd" such that the average value of any polynomial "f" of degree "t" or less on the set equals the average value of "f" on the whole sphere (that is, the integral of "f" over "Sd" divided by the area or measure of "Sd"). Such a set is often called a spherical "t"-design to indicate the value of "t", which is a fundamental parameter.
Spherical designs can be of value in approximation theory, in statistics for experimental design (being usable to construct rotatable designs), in combinatorics, and in geometry. The main problem is to find examples, given "d" and "t", that are not too large. However, such examples may be hard to come by.
Spherical t-designs have also recently been appropriated in quantum mechanics in the form of quantum t-designs with various applications to quantum information theory, quantum computing and POVMs.
The concept of a spherical design is due to Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel (1977). The existence and structure of spherical designs with "d" = 1 (that is, in a circle) was studied in depth by Hong (1982).
arbitrary-dimensional spherical design.
Shortly thereafter, Seymour and Zaslavsky (1984) proved that such designs exist of all sufficiently large sizes; that is, there is a number "N"("d","t") such that for every "N" ≥ "N"("d","t") there exists a spherical "t"-design of "N" points in dimension "d". However, their proof gave no idea of how big "N"("d","t") is. Good estimates for that were found later on. Besides these "large" sizes, there are many sporadic small spherical designs; many of them are related to finite group actions on the sphere and are of great interest in themselves.
Recently, Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Viazovska obtained the optimal asymptotic upper bound
formula_1 for all positive integers "d" and "t".
2-dimensional spherical design.
Spherical designs with "d" = 2 (that is, on the surface of a sphere) ...
One application of spherical designs is for whole-sphere data collection.
Spherical t-designs meet the "accurately approximate integrals by sums" criteria for "good" pixelizations of the sphere.

Steve Adams (Western Federation of Miners)

Steve Adams, sometimes known as Stephen Adams, played a minor, but particularly revealing, role in events surrounding the murder trial of Harry Orchard, and the trials of Western Federation of Miners (WFM) leaders Bill Haywood, Charles Moyer, and George Pettibone, all charged with conspiring to murder former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg, allegedly relating to a miner uprising in Coeur d'Alene, and in the aftermath of the Colorado Labor Wars. The investigations were led by famed Pinkerton agent James McParland. As a witness for the state who recanted, Adams is particularly notable for his comments about the methods used by agent McParland to turn defendants against each other.
The Haywood trial.
McParland had WFM member Harry Orchard in custody, and had obtained an elaborate confession. However, McParland knew that he needed more than the confession of one man to convict Bill Haywood, who was being tried first among the trio of WFM leaders. Steve Adams was "a thirty-nine-year-old former Kansas City butcher and Cripple Creek miner with heavy, drooping eyelids and a booze-blotched complexion." Harry Orchard had described Adams as an accomplice in several crimes. As in the cases of Haywood, Moyer, and Pettibone, McParland relied upon a perjured warrant to cross state lines and grab Adams. The prisoner wasn't charged with any crime, but was held at the penitentiary in Idaho with Orchard. This was not according to McParland's plans:
If arrested, Adams was supposed to be kept in a separate cell away from Orchard as McParland explicitly spelled out to the warden. To prime a man for confessing, McParland required solitary confinement, a penetrating silence, the watchful presence of a stony guard, and as few contacts as possible. Adams was to be denied access to an attorney, knowledge of his wife and children, and no information on the charges against him.
Together in the cell, Orchard described his own confession to Adams, and urged Adams to also confess. In spite of the missed instruction about isolation, McParland reportedly later obtained such a confession from Adams. 
Although Steve Adams wasn't allowed to know anything about his wife and children, they weren't far away:
His wife, Annie, and their small children had also been locked in the penitentiary shortly after his arrest for "their own protection," McParland had assured him, hinting that something dreadful might befall them.
Adams' family was brought to the prison "as a means to 'sweat' him."
Clarence Darrow intervenes.
However, Haywood defense attorney Clarence Darrow passed the word that he would defend Adams, and the prisoner immediately recanted. This provoked the prosecution to try Adams in an old murder case for which there was only flimsy evidence. In fact the only significant evidence against Adams was his now-repudiated confession which appeared to have been coerced, as Harry Orchard's confession was coerced. The difference appeared to be that there was clear evidence of Orchard's guilt in the Steunenberg murder, and perhaps in a string of crimes, but little or no evidence linking the others.
Adams had been dining well and provided with fine cigars since signing his confession, as had Harry Orchard. The note announcing that Adams recanted that confession was passed secretly from his jail cell via his wife, Annie, during a visit. The note "delivered a lightning bolt" to the prosecution. It declared,
This is to certify that the statement that I signed was made up by James McParland, detective, and Harry Orchard, alias Tom Hogan. I signed it because I was threatened by Governor Gooding, saying I would be hanged if I did not corroborate Orchard's story against the officers of the federation union of miners. Stephen Adams. Witness: Annie Adams.
Steve Adams testifies.
Adams took the witness stand in his own murder trial and testified, in part,
I was taken to the office of the penitentiary and introduced to detective McParland. He told me about "Kelly the Bum" McParland's Molly Maguires case and other men who had turned state's evidence and had been set free. ... McParland told me he wanted to convict leaders Moyer, Haywood, Pettibone, St. John, and Simpkins, whom he called 'cut-throats.' If I did not help to convict them, he said, I would be taken back to Colorado and either hanged or mobbed. If I did help, I would only be taken to Colorado as a witness. ... When the confession was made, McParland led me on a step-by-step and showed me all they wanted me to say. ... He wanted the names of the officers of the Federation used as much as possible all through the confession.
McParland's own reports to Idaho Governor Gooding confirm Steve Adams' courtroom statements.
Adams described how information from the question and answer session with McParland, with the Pinkerton detective guiding him from "notes in his pocket," had been typed and returned to him in the form of a narrative document which he was required to sign. The narrative was written in a form that was not consistent with Adams' manner of speech. The document ended with, "I hope that the reign of terror inaugurated by Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone...will cease."
Adams also claimed that Orchard had colluded with McParland to rewrite his own confession because "he could not repeat it the second time anything at all like the first one."
It was L.J. "Jack" Simpkins, also known as J. Simmons, who accompanied Harry Orchard to Caldwell, but left before former governor Stuenenberg was assassinated. Simpkins was the WFM executive board member with responsibility for Idaho. The Pinkerton Agency produced a poster offering a two thousand dollar reward for his arrest, but "some skeptics believed that he was actually a Pinkerton agent provocateur." The allegations appear to have been unfounded.
Other McParland schemes involving Steve Adams.
At one point in the trial of Bill Haywood, McParland concocted a scheme that would seek to frighten Moyer into testifying against Haywood and Pettibone by alleging that Pettibone had urged Orchard and Adams to kill Moyer. The plan was not carried out because McParland came up with an alternative scheme. But the alternative scheme failed when Moyer refused to accept the bait.
Results of the trials.
Adams was not found guilty of the murder. He was tried three times altogether, and both trials in Idaho ended in hung juries. Yet he would still face a trial for his life in Colorado.
Haywood and Pettibone were found not guilty of the Steunenberg assassination in separate trials. Moyer was released. 
Harry Orchard was found guilty of the murder of Frank Steunenberg and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted. Orchard would spend the rest of his life in prison.
In the Colorado trial of Steve Adams, attorney Orrin N. Hilton challenged the legality of Adams' confession. McParland testified, and so did the Pinkerton stenographer who took down the confession. The stenographer admitted that McParland directed him what to take down, and what to leave out. The stenographer also confirmed that the confession was not written in language attributable to the defendant, and that sometimes "the substance of the conversation" was added in at a later time. The judge considered the issue overnight. In court the next day, he cited McParland's own testimony about the threat of hanging, and the promise of reward — freedom in return for a confession — which McParland routinely used in obtaining confessions. The judge ruled that the confession was gained illicitly, and the confession itself was barred. The judge ruled, however, that witnesses could attest to what Steve Adams had admitted in their presence. The information provided by the witnesses was contradictory, incomplete, and in some cases appeared to come from newspaper accounts.
In fact, Steve Adams had been accused of involvement in two murders in Colorado, one of which never happened. 
In her research for the book "The Corpse On Boomerang Road, Telluride's War On Labor 1899-1908," MaryJoy Martin uncovered an elaborate scheme by mine owners and their supporters to blame the Telluride, Colorado, local of the Western Federation of Miners with a string of murders for which there was no evidence. Newspapers printed articles about how the murders allegedly occurred, and named union officials who had committed the crimes. The mine owners, the local sheriff, and James McParland of the Pinkerton Agency used the accusations of murder to publicize an alleged "reign of terror" as a means of destroying the union. One allegedly deceased victim, William J. Barney, was a mine guard who simply had disappeared from his job. In spite of elaborate and detailed chronologies of the murder that were printed in the local newspapers, Barney was still alive. However, this fact wasn't known to the jury sitting in judgment of Steve Adams. 
Even so, it wasn't long before the jury decided that testimony by Bulkeley Wells, manager of the Smuggler-Union Mining Company, who had sought the conviction and execution of Western Federation of Miners leaders for years, was not credible. Wells had constructed a scenario under which Steve Adams committed the murder with a shotgun. The jury, mostly area farmers, were intimately familiar with shotguns. The murder scenario, in their judgment, was impossible.
The jury deliberated for an hour before taking a straw poll. They were unanimous; the defendant was not guilty. After three years in prison, Steve Adams was set free.

Homestead (buildings)

A homestead consists of a dwelling, often a farm house together with other buildings and associated land. Historically it referred to land claimed by settler or squatter under the Homestead Act (USA) or Dominion Lands Act (Canada). A homestead may be a ranch, station or a large agricultural operation of some other designation. In Old English the term was used to mean a human settlement, and in Southern Africa the term is used for a cluster of several houses normally occupied by a single extended family.

Uniflow steam engine

The uniflow type of steam engine uses steam that flows in one direction only in each half of the cylinder. Thermal efficiency is increased in the compound and multiple expansion types of steam engine by separating expansion into steps in separate cylinders; in the uniflow design, thermal efficiency is achieved by having a temperature gradient along the cylinder. Steam always enters at the hot ends of the cylinder and exhausts through ports at the cooler centre. By this means, the relative heating and cooling of the cylinder walls is reduced.
Design details.
Steam entry is usually controlled by poppet valves (which act similarly to those used in internal combustion engines) that are operated by a camshaft. The inlet valves open to admit steam when minimum expansion volume has been reached at the start of the stroke. For a period of the crank cycle, steam is admitted, and the poppet inlet is then closed, allowing continued expansion of the steam during the stroke, driving the piston. Near the end of the stroke, the piston will uncover a ring of exhaust ports mounted radially around the centre of the cylinder. These ports are connected by a manifold and piping to the condenser, lowering the pressure in the chamber below that of the atmosphere causing rapid exhausting. Continued rotation of the crank moves the piston. From the animation, the features of a uniflow engine can be seen, with a large piston almost half the length of the cylinder, poppet inlet valves at either end, a camshaft (whose motion is derived from that of the driveshaft) and a central ring of exhaust ports.
Advantages.
Uniflow engines potentially allow greater expansion in a single cylinder without the relatively cool exhaust steam flowing across the hot end of the working cylinder and steam ports of a conventional "counterflow" steam engine during the exhaust stroke. This condition allows higher thermal efficiency. The exhaust ports are only open for a small fraction of the piston stroke, with the exhaust ports closed just after the piston begins traveling toward the admission end of the cylinder. The steam remaining within the cylinder after the exhaust ports are closed is trapped, and this trapped steam is compressed by the returning piston. This is thermodynamically desirable as it preheats the hot end of the cylinder before the admission of steam. However, the risk of excessive compression often results in small auxiliary exhaust ports being included at the cylinder heads. Such a design is called a semi-uniflow engine. 
Engines of this type usually have multiple cylinders in an in-line arrangement, and may be single- or double-acting. A particular advantage of this type is that the valves may be operated by the effect of multiple camshafts, and by changing the relative phase of these camshafts, the amount of steam admitted may be increased for high torque at low speed, and may be decreased at cruising speed for economy of operation. And, by changing the absolute phase, the engine's direction of rotation may be changed. The uniflow design also maintains a constant temperature gradient through the cylinder, avoiding passing hot and cold steam through the same end of the cylinder.
Disadvantages.
In practice, the uniflow engine has a number of operational shortcomings. The large expansion ratio requires a large cylinder volume. To gain the maximum potential work from the engine a high reciprocation rate is required, typically 80% faster than a double-acting counterflow type engine. This causes the opening times of the inlet valves to be very short, putting great strain on a delicate mechanical part. In order to withstand the huge mechanical forces encountered, engines have to be heavily built and a large flywheel is required to smooth out the variations in torque as the steam pressure rapidly rises and falls in the cylinder. Because there is a thermal gradient across the cylinder, the metal of the wall expands to different extents. This requires the cylinder bore to be machined wider in the cool center than at the hot ends. If the cylinder is not heated correctly, or if water enters, the delicate balance can be upset causing seizure mid-stroke or, potentially, destruction.
History.
The uniflow engine was first used in Britain in 1827 by Jacob Perkins and was patented in 1885 by Leonard Jennett Todd. It was popularised by German engineer Johann Stumpf in 1909, with the first commercial stationary engine produced a year previously in 1908.
Steam locomotives.
The uniflow principle was mainly used for industrial power generation, but was also tried in a few railway locomotives in England, such as the North Eastern Railway uniflow locomotives No 825 of 1913, and No 2212 of 1919, and the Midland Railway Paget locomotive. Experiments were also made in the USA and Russia. In no case were the results encouraging enough for further development to be undertaken.
Skinner Unaflow.
The final commercial evolution of the Uniflow engine occurred in the USA during the late 1930s and 1940s by the Skinner Engine Company with the development of the Compound Unaflow Marine Steam Engine. This engine operates in a steeple compound configuration and provides efficiencies approaching contemporary diesels. Many car ferries on the Great Lakes were so equipped, one of which is still operating, of 1952. The Casablanca class escort carrier, the most prolific aircraft carrier design in history, used two 5-cylinder Skinner Unaflow engines, but these were not steeple compounds. A non-compound Skinner Uniflow remained in service until 2013 in the Great Lakes cement carrier "SS St. Marys Challenger", installed when the vessel was repowered in 1950.
In small sizes (less than about 1000 horsepower), reciprocating steam engines are much more efficient than steam turbines. White Cliffs Solar Power Station used a three-cylinder uniflow engine with "bash" type admission valves to generate about 25 kW electrical output.
The single-acting uniflow steam engine configuration closely resembles that of a two-stroke internal combustion engine, and it is possible to convert a two-stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by feeding the cylinder with steam via a "bash valve" fitted in place of the spark plug. As the rising piston nears the top of its stroke, it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam. The valve closes automatically as the piston descends, and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting. The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the top of its stroke against the compression, as it does in the original form of the engine. Also like the original, the conversion is not self-starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start. An example of such a conversion is the steam-powered moped, which is started by pedalling.

Talim Island is the largest lake island in Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines. The hilly island is within the boundaries of the Province of Rizal, under the jurisdiction of two municipalities. The western side is part of the municipality of Binangonan, while the eastern section is part of Cardona.
The island is volcanic in origin and forms the southwest rim of the Laguna Caldera. Volcanism after the formation of the caldera created the maars and volcanic craters at the southern end of Talim Island, the largest of which is a crater surrounding Brgys. Balibago and Tuna.
Political subdivision.
The island consists of 24 barangays that lie along its shores, 17 belongs to the town of Binangonan and 7 to Cardona.
<br>
Geography.
Talim Island is located almost at the center of Laguna de Bay, a three-lobed lake the center of which is the Laguna Caldera. The northernmost tip of the island is separated from the mainland by Diablo Pass, which is only about at the narrowest. The southernmost tip of the island is called Talim Point.
The highest point of the island is Mount Tagapo, known locally as ""Bundok ng Susong Dalaga"" (Maiden's breast mountains) for the conical hill at its peak resembling the female breast. The hill is among the several in the Tagalog region that are called as such because of its shape. This feature is best observed from neighboring Mount Sembrano in the Jalajala peninsula across the lake.
Economy.
The island is rich in bamboo grass, which the islanders make into different types of furniture such as bamboo sofas, cabinets, tables, chairs and a lot more. It is their main source of living, while lake fishing is only secondary.

<doc id="9730355" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9730355" title="Vienna School of Art History">
Vienna School of Art History

The Vienna School of Art History ("Wiener Schule der Kunstgeschichte") was the development of fundamental art-historical methods at the University of Vienna. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.
A characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a "scientific" ("wissenschaftlich") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.
The concept of a Viennese "school" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by Otto Benesch in 1920 and by Julius von Schlosser in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.
History.
Pragmatic art history.
Rudolf Eitelberger is considered to have been the "forefather" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the Vormärz, and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.
The first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was Moritz Thausing, who in 1879 became the second "Ordinarius" (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from aesthetics.
Formalist art history.
Thausing's students Franz Wickhoff (Professor 1891) and Alois Riegl (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of late antiquity, which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of positivism, focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.
Idealist art history.
After the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by Max Dvořák, who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary expressionist movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of Mannerism. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed ""Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte"" ("art history as intellectual history"), found its most committed champions in Hans Tietze and Otto Benesch.
Structuralist art history.
Dvořák also died young, and in 1922 Julius von Schlosser was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce and of Karl Vossler, a Munich-based professor of the Romance languages, under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the ""Stilgeschichte"" ("style-history") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the ""Sprachgeschichte"" ("language-history") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides Ernst Gombrich, were Hans Sedlmayr and Otto Pächt, who in the 1930s founded art-historical "structuralism." Their methodology was described by Meyer Schapiro as the "New Vienna School"; it has also been described as the "Second Vienna School."
Ideological art history.
Josef Strzygowski, who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original "Nordic" character, which was superior to the "Mediterranean." As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the "orthodox" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the "arch-humanist" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the "Attila of art history." The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of ""Planforschung"," which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely "Nordic," was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.
Synthesis.
The era of Nazism signified a turning point for the Vienna School. Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. Hans Sedlmayr, a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, Karl Maria Swoboda assumed leadership of the "Insitut", where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two "Ordinarius" positions were once more created, and were filled by Otto Pächt (a student of Schlosser) and Otto Demus (a student of Strzygowski). Under the "two Ottos" Vienna became a ""Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte"" ("a mecca for medieval art history"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of Fritz Novotny. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.

__NOTOC__
Description.
The performance begins with the magician being joined by a spectator (who might be an audience member or the host of a show of which this illusion is a part). A large upright cabinet is presented. It is just large enough to contain a person and has a stylised sillouette of a woman on the front. A female assistant is introduced. It is explained that the box divides into four sections, as indicated by lines on its front, and the assistant will be cut into four pieces. The box is opened and the assistant steps inside. She crouches down to show the individual sections of the box are apparently too small to hold her. She then stands up again and her wrists are tied to cords within the top sections of the box. It is pointed out that the only way she can move out of position would be to untie herself with her teeth and then re-tie herself at the end of the trick. The box is closed up and blades are inserted to divide it into four sections as indicated by the lines on the front. The top sections are then hinged downwards so that all four sections are resting on the ground. The bottom sections are also hinged apart—so the result is the four sections appear to be separated although they remain connected at their edges by hinges. The magician then brings out two swords. He thrusts one sword into a couple of the boxes and invites the spectator to thrust the other sword into the remaining sections. The box is then re-assembled and the blades are removed. The box is then hinged apart to show the girl safe and well and still tied up inside.
History.
The history of this illusion is vague and not well documented and it is sometimes confused with other Harbin illusions including the "Jigsaw Lady". However a number of pictures exist showing different performances. One performance in January 1972 involved "The Vernon Sisters" singing group as assistants. A brief glimpse of another performance is seen in the British television documentary "Heroes of Magic".

Franziska Tausig (born c. 1895 – died 1989) was an Austrian author. Her parents were deported to Theresienstadt and killed in Treblinka.
She gave birth to her son, Otto Tausig, in 1922 in Vienna. He later became an actor and director. In 1938, the persecution of Jews was heightening in Nazi-dominated Austria. She sent her son, Otto (then 16), to England through an advertisement in "The Times" calling for workers, thus saving him. In 1938, she acquired two tickets for the "Usaramo", a ship that was supposed to be scrapped in Japan, which transported Jews to Shanghai on the way. She emigrated to Shanghai with her husband, who died there of tuberculosis shortly thereafter. Ten years later, in 1948, Tausig was reunited with her son in Vienna.
In 1987, she published her memoirs with the title "Shanghai Passage: Flucht und Exil einer Wienerin" (escape and exile of a Viennese). In this book she describes her desperate escape from Austria.

Meena Alexander

Meena Alexander (born 1951) is an internationally acclaimed poet, scholar, and writer. She is the author of numerous collections of poetry, literary memoirs, essays, and works of fiction and literary criticism.
Biography.
Meena Alexander was born into a Syrian Christian family from Kerala, South India. She lived in Allahabad and Kerala until she was almost five when her father’s work—as a scientist for the Indian government—took the family to Khartoum in newly independent Sudan. In 1964, when she was only thirteen, Alexander enrolled in Khartoum University, where she studied English and French literature. There she wrote her ﬁrst poems, which were translated into Arabic and published in a local newspaper. After graduating with a BA Honors from Khartoum University in 1969, she moved to England and began doctoral study at Nottingham University. She earned a PhD in English in 1973—at the age of twenty-two—with a dissertation in Romantic literature that she would later develop and publish as "The Poetic Self". She then moved to India and taught at several universities, including the University of Delhi and the University of Hyderabad. During the five years she lived in India she published her first three books of poetry: "The Bird's Bright Ring" (1976), "I Root My Name" (1977), and "Without Place" (1978). In 1979 she was a visiting fellow at the University of Paris-Sorbonne. The following year she moved to New York City and became an assistant professor at Fordham University, where she remained until 1987 when she became an assistant professor in the English Department at Hunter College, the City University of New York (CUNY). Two years later she joined the graduate faculty of the PhD program in English at the CUNY Graduate Center. In 1992 she was made full professor of English and Women’s Studies. She was appointed Distinguished Professor of English in 1999 and continues to teach in the PhD program at the Graduate Center and the MFA program at Hunter College. Over the years she has also taught poetry in the Writing Division in the School of the Arts at Columbia University. Since moving to New York, Alexander has been a prolific author, publishing six more volumes of poetry, two books of literary criticism, two books of lyric essays, two novels, and a memoir. She is married to the brother of journalist and author Joseph Lelyveld, and has two children.
Alexander is known for lyrical writing that deals with migration, its impact on the subjectivity of the writer, and the sometimes violent events that compel people to cross borders. Though confronting such stark and difficult issues, her writing is sensual, polyglot, and maintains a generous spirit. About her work, Maxine Hong Kingston has said: "Meena Alexander sings of countries, foreign and familiar, places where the heart and spirit live, and places for which one needs a passport and visas. Her voice guides us far away and back home. The reader sees her visions and remembers and is uplifted." Alexander has been influenced and mentored by the Indian poets Jayanta Mahapatra and Kamala Das, as well as the American poets Adrienne Rich and Galway Kinnell.
Among her best-known works are the volumes of poetry "Illiterate Heart" (2002) and "Raw Silk" (2004). Her latest volume of poetry is "Quickly Changing River" (2008). She has edited a volume of poems in the Everyman Series, "Indian Love Poems" (2005), and published a volume of essays and poems on the themes of migration and memory called "The Shock of Arrival: Reﬂections on Postcolonial Experience" (2006). In 1993 Alexander published her autobiographical memoir, "Fault Lines" (significantly revised in 2003 to incorporate new material). She has published two novels, "Nampally Road" (1991)—which was a Village Voice Literary Supplement Editor’s Choice—and "Manhattan Music" (1997), and two academic studies, "The Poetic Self" (1979) and "Women in Romanticism" (1989). "Fault Lines" was chosen by "Publishers Weekly" as one of the best books of the year in 1993. "Illiterate Heart" won the 2002 PEN Open Book Award.
Alexander has read at Poetry International (London), Struga Poetry Evenings, Poetry Africa, Calabash Festival, Harbor Front Festival, Sahitya Akademi (India) and other international gatherings. She has received awards from the Guggenheim Foundation, Fulbright Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Arts Council England, National Endowment for the Humanities, American Council of Learned Societies, National Council for Research on Women, New York State Council on the Arts, New York Foundation for the Arts, Ledig-Rowohlt Foundation. She was in residence at the MacDowell Colony and has held the Martha Walsh Pulver residency for a poet at Yaddo. She has been a Visiting Fellow at the Sorbonne (Paris IV), Frances Wayland Collegium Lecturer at Brown University, Writer in Residence at the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University, University Grants Commission Fellow at Kerala University, and Writer in Residence at the National University of Singapore. In 1998 she was a Member of the Jury for the Neustadt International Prize for Literature. She has served as an Elector, American Poets' Corner, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York. She was the recipient of the 2009 Literary Excellence Award from the South Asian Literary Association (an organization allied to the Modern Languages Association) for contributions to American literature. In 2014, Meena Alexander was named a National Fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study.
Her book, "Poetics of Dislocation", was published in 2009 by the University of Michigan Press as part of its Poets on Poetry Series. Also in 2009 Cambridge Scholars Publishing brought out an anthology of scholarship on her work titled "Passage to Manhattan: Critical Essays on Meena Alexander".
The poems in her new book, "Birthplace with Buried Stones", "convey the fragmented experience of the traveler, for whom home is both nowhere and everywhere" [http://meenaalexander.com/birthplace-with-buried-stones/].
"Nampally Road".
Haunting and lyrical, the novel Nampally Road vividly portrays
contemporary India and one woman’s struggle to piece together her
past. At the heart of this novel, is the gang rape of Rameeza Be by
the police. The towns people rise up and burn the police station. This
novel reissued in 2013 by Orient Blackswan has a powerful resonance
with the recent tragic events in Delhi. When it was first published in
1991 the novel was a Voice Literary Supplement Editor’s Choice.

The Lost Tomb of Jesus

The Lost Tomb of Jesus is a documentary co-produced and first broadcast on the Discovery Channel and Vision TV in Canada on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the Talpiot Tomb. It was directed by Canadian documentary and film maker Simcha Jacobovici and produced by Felix Golubev and Ric Esther Bienstock, while James Cameron served as executive producer. The film was released in conjunction with a book about the same subject, "The Jesus Family Tomb", issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and Charles R. Pellegrino. The documentary and book's claims are the subject of controversy within the archaeological and theological fields, as well as among linguistic and biblical scholars.
Content.
The film describes the finding of the Talpiot Tomb during a housing construction project, and posits that it was the family tomb of Jesus. The film states that ten ossuaries were found in the cave, of which six are the subject of the film. Further, it claims that one of the ten ossuaries went missing years ago, presumably stolen.
The excavation report for the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority was written by Amos Kloner, now professor of archaeology at Israel's Bar-Ilan University. Kloner dissociated himself from the claims made in the documentary. He said it was incorrect to call it "never before reported information" and that he had published all the details in the journal "Antiqot" in 1996. He had not said it was the tomb of Jesus' family. "I think it is very unserious work. I do scholarly work…," Kloner said. "film is all nonsense."
Six of the nine remaining ossuaries bear inscriptions. "The Lost Tomb of Jesus" posits that three of those carry the names of figures from the New Testament. The meanings of the epigraphs are disputed. The makers of the documentary claim that four leading epigraphers have corroborated their interpretation of the inscriptions. As translated in "The Lost Tomb of Jesus" and "The Jesus Family Tomb", they read as follows:
Four leading epigraphers have corroborated the ossuary inscriptions for "The Lost Tomb of Jesus," according to the Discovery Channel.
The film further claims that the tenth ossuary, which went missing years ago, is the James Ossuary purported to contain the body of James, the brother of Jesus.
In "The Jesus Family Tomb", Simcha Jacobovici claims the James Ossuary would have been a part of this tomb, but was removed by artifact dealers, and thus discovered separately. The James Ossuary's authenticity has been called into question, and one of its past owners has been charged with fraud in connection to the artifact.
Ben Witherington III, who worked with Jacobovici on a Discovery Channel documentary on the James Ossuary, denies this connection on two grounds:
Another consideration was that the measurements of the James Ossuary did not match the measurements listed for the tenth ossuary, which is no longer stored with the rest of the collection. The James Ossuary was listed as being approximately 50 centimeters long by 30 centimeters wide on one end, and 25.5 centimeters on the other end. The tenth ossuary in the Talpiot collection is listed as 60 centimeters long by 26 centimeters by 30 centimeters. Furthermore, Amos Kloner has stated that the tenth ossuary had no inscription. Also, Joe Zias, former curator of the Rockefeller Museum who received and catalogued the ossuaries, refuted this claim on his personal site.
New information has now shown that the discrepancy in the measurements had to do with measuring the base of the ossuary, which is indeed 50 centimeters, rather than the length. The top length of the James ossuary, not the base, which is trapezoidal in shape, according to the latest remeasurement carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority, is 57.5 centimeters. However, this does not prove that the James ossuary is the missing tenth Talpiot ossuary.
DNA tests.
Analysis of mitochondrial DNA performed by Lakehead University on the remains found in the ossuary marked "Jesus son of Joseph" and the one marked "Mariamne" or "Mary" (who some claim to be Mary Magdalene) found that the two occupants were not blood relations on their mothers' side. Based on these tests, the makers of the documentary suggest that "Jesus" and "Mariamne" were probably married "because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb," but the remains were not dated using radiocarbon to further sustain this supposition, neither was any announced DNA testing done on the others ossuaries to see if any familial relation existed there. Additionally, scholars argue the DNA tests only prove that they did not have the same mother and they could easily have been father/daughter, cousins, half brother/sister, or any number of possibilities that do not include a matrilineage line.
New views of Jesus endorsed by the film.
Christian views.
The film proposes new interpretations of the events regarding Jesus depicted in the New Testament, as seen by mainstream Christianity. The film's suggestions contradict
the basis of the faith and may be considered blasphemous by Christians:
The claim that Jesus was married also undermines the theological metaphor of the Church being the "Bride of Christ" (found in the writings of the New Testament). Jimmy Akin, director of Apologetics and Evangelization at Catholic Answers, wrote: "This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem…. We know about wives of religion founders because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence." As for a possible "son of Jesus," he noted: "We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to sneak a forgotten son by the eyes of history…. It's not just hard to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor."
The filmmakers denied that the claims made in the film contradicted key teachings of Christianity, such as the resurrection and ascension. The film's religious consultant James Tabor stated that the fact that Jesus' tomb was discovered does not put in doubt biblical accounts of his resurrection, which he said could have been spiritual. With regard to the ascension, the documentary's website suggests that while the tomb's discovery does not render impossible the notion of a spiritual ascension, it does contradict the belief that Jesus physically ascended to heaven.
Islamic views.
Finding someone's remains in Jesus' tomb conforms to the Muslim belief that a substitute for him was crucified, while he was raised bodily to heaven. The Islamic view of his disappearance, as mentioned in the Qur'an, states: "That they said (in boast), "We killed Al-Masih 'Isa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah"; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them". The general Muslim interpretation of the verse is that God, to revenge from Judas' betrayal to Jesus (the fatherless prophet), made his face similar to that of Jesus, while Jesus ascended into heaven and is to return near the end of time and kill the anti-Christ. Accordingly, the discovered remains in his tomb would then actually belong to Judas, a Roman guard, or a volunteering disciple.
Reception.
Following the March 4, 2007, airing of "The Lost Tomb of Jesus" on the Discovery Channel, American journalist Ted Koppel aired a program entitled "The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look", whose guests included the director Simcha Jacobovici, James Tabor, Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who served as a consultant and advisor on the documentary, Jonathan Reed, Professor of Religion at the University of LaVerne and co-author of "Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text," and William Dever, an archaeologist with over 50 years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs.
Alan Cooperman, writer of "The Washington Post" article also states this: "Similar assessments came yesterday from two Israeli scholars, Amos Kloner, who originally excavated the tomb, and Joe Zias, former curator of archaeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority. Kloner told the Jerusalem Post that the documentary is "nonsense." Zias described it in an e-mail to "The Washington Post" as a "hyped up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."
Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time.
"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family," and "The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film." he told the BBC News website.
During the documentary "The Lost Tomb of Jesus", various professionals had claimed:
During Ted Koppel's critique, "The Lost Tomb of Jesus—a Critical Look", Koppel revealed he had denials from these three people that Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.
The archaeologist William Dever summed it up when he stated on Koppel's critical analysis, "The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look", that Jacobovici's and Cameron's "conclusions were already drawn in the beginning" of the inquiry and that their "argument goes far beyond any reasonable interpretation."
Archaeological Questions.
The Three Skulls.
Three skulls were found on the floor of the tomb in 1980 which the film makers assert was usual but others disagree: "This too was decidedly not typical. In ancient Jerusalem, the dead were placed inside tombs; in tombs, the dead were placed inside ossuaries. If anything was left behind, it was a lamp or a bottle of perfume, not skulls."
Criticism of the documentary.
Early Christianity scholar R. Joseph Hoffmann, chair of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, says the film alerts the public to the fact that there are no secure conclusions when it comes to the foundational history of a religious tradition. But he charges that the film "is all about bad assumptions," beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it "amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion—and a hammer."
When interviewed about the upcoming documentary, Amos Kloner, who oversaw the original archaeological dig of this tomb in 1980 said:
"Newsweek" reports that the archaeologist who personally numbered the ossuaries dismissed any potential connection:
The aforementioned Joe Zias has published in his own site a "viewers' guide" to the Talpiot Tomb documentary, in which he systematically rebuts the film's argumentation and gives much background information about the people involved in it.
Stephen Pfann, president of Jerusalem's University of the Holy Land and an expert in Semitic languages, who was interviewed in the documentary, also said the film's hypothesis holds little weight:
Pfann also thinks the inscription read as "Jesus" has been misread and suggests that the name "Hanun" might be a more accurate rendering.
"The Washington Post" reports that William G. Dever (mentioned above as excavating ancient sites in Israel for 50 years) offered the following:
Asbury Theological Seminary's Ben Witherington III points out some other circumstantial problems with linking this tomb to Jesus' family:
The Archaeological Institute of America, self-described on their website as "North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archeology," has published online their own criticism of the "Jesus tomb" claim: 
"The identification of the Talpiyot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family is based on a string of problematic and unsubstantiated claims [...] contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus. This claim is also inconsistent with all of the available information—historical and archaeological—about how Jews in the time of Jesus buried their dead, and specifically the evidence we have about poor, non-Judean families like that of Jesus. It is a sensationalistic claim without any scientific basis or support."
DNA and family evidence.
Dr. Darrel L. Bock, a New Testament scholar and research professor of New Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary points out some of the inconsistencies, including: "If Jesus' family came from Galilee, why would they have a family tomb in Jerusalem?"
Dr. Ben Witherington III points out an inconsistency related to the James Ossuary. He points out that the James Ossuary came from Silwan, not Talpiot. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that "matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem." In his opinion, this is problematic, because "the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it." Therefore, he believes that it is difficult to believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately and far away from Jesus' family.
In addition, during the trial of antiquities dealer Oded Golan there has been testimony from former FBI agent Gerald Richard that a photo of the James ossuary, showing it in Golan's home, was taken in the 1970s, based on tests done by the FBI photo lab. This would make it impossible for the James Ossuary to have been discovered with the rest of the Talpiot ossuaries in the 1980s.
With reference to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all." This quote clarifies the fact that the documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the "Jesus son of Joseph" and the "Mariamne" in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. that they did not have the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.
"The New York Times" article of February 27, 2007, (reprinted in full on many websites) states:
The documentary's director and its driving force, Simcha Jacobovici…, said there was enough mitochondrial DNA for a laboratory in Ontario to conclude that the bodies in the "Jesus" and "Mary Magdalene" ossuaries were not related on their mothers' side. From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary. "We're not scientists. At the end of the day we can't wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA," he said. "We took the story that far. At some point you have to say, I've done my job as a journalist."
In the televised debate following the airing of the film, Ted Koppel pressed Jacobovici on the same question and received the same response. According to the authors of one blog, "the response is manifestly disingenuous. The question, in fact, necessarily arises whether the team or one of its members decided not to proceed with any further DNA tests. Such tests may have revealed that none of the ossuaries are related—hence defeating the underlying presupposition that the crypt was in fact a family tomb, and thereby eliminating any valid basis at all for producing and showing the film."
William G. Dever said that some of the inscriptions on the ossuaries are unclear, but that all of the names are common. "I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."
Jodi Magness, an archaeologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, notes that at the time of Jesus, wealthy families buried their dead in tombs cut by hand from solid rock, putting the bones in niches in the walls and then, later, transferring them to ossuaries. "If Jesus' family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock-cut tomb, it would have been in Nazareth, not Jerusalem," Magness writes.
According to Magness, the names on the Talpiot ossuaries indicate that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name. As Galileans, Jesus and his family members would have used their first name and hometown. "This whole case (for the tomb of Jesus) is flawed from beginning to end."
There is no information on analyzing relation of "Mary" and "Jesus son of Joseph" or any other tomb occupants. In Jewish tradition of the time, after one year, when bodies in rock-cut tombs were decomposed, bones were collected, cleaned and then finally placed in an ossuary. Due to this conduct there is no real assurance that what scientists have really examined are remnants of "Mariamne e Mara" and "Jesus son of Joseph."
Interpretation of the inscriptions.
David Mavorah, a curator of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, points out that the names on the ossuaries were extremely common. "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there to say this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely." David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Dr. Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the statistics section above.
Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem district archaeologist of the Israel Antiquities Authority and the first archaeologist to examine the tomb in 1980, told the "Yedioth Ahronoth" newspaper that the name Jesus had been found 71 times in burial caves at around that time. Furthermore, he said that the inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: "The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus…. They just want to get money for it."
Dr. Richard Bauckham, professor at the University of St Andrews, catalogued ossuary names from that region since 1980. He records that based on the catalogue, "Jesus" was the 6th most popular name of Jewish men, and "Mary/Mariamne" was the single most popular name of Jewish women at that time. Therefore, finding two ossuaries containing the names "Jesus" and "Mary/Mariamne" is not significant at all, and the chances of it being the ossuaries of Jesus and Mary Magdalene are "very small indeed."
Concerning the inscription attributed to Jesus son of Joseph, Steve Caruso, a professional Aramaic translator using a computer to visualize different interpretations, claims that although it is "possible" to read it as "Yeshua" that "overall it is a very strong possibility that this inscription is not '"Yeshua` bar Yehosef".'"
The name "Mary" and its derivatives may have been used by up to 25% of Jewish women at that time.
Publicity.
Lawrence E. Stager, the Dorot professor of archaeology of Israel at Harvard, said the documentary was "exploiting the whole trend that caught on with "The Da Vinci Code." One of the problems is there are so many biblically illiterate people around the world that they don't know what is real judicious assessment and what is what some of us in the field call 'fantastic archaeology.'"
William G. Dever said, "I'm not a Christian. I'm not a believer. I don't have a dog in this fight. I just think it's a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated."
Jodi Magness criticized the decision of the documentary makers to make their claims at a news conference rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific article. By going directly to the media, she said, the filmmakers "have set it up as if it's a legitimate academic debate, when the vast majority of scholars who specialize in archeology of this period have flatly rejected this."
Joe Zias, former curator of archeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority, described it in an e-mail to "The Washington Post" as a "hyped-up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest." He also wrote an extended Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb documentary, published on his web site.
François Bovon has also written to say that his comments were misused. In a letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, he wrote:
Symposium and media coverage.
Following a symposium at Princeton in January 2008 media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited. "Time" and CNN devoted extensive coverage, implying that the case had been re-opened.
Scholars who had been present at the symposium then accused Jacobovici and Cameron of misleading the media in claiming the symposium reopened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including all the archaeologists and epigraphers, who delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are "nothing further from the truth".
DVD Editions.
On March 15, 2007, Discovery Channel released a DVD of the documentary with a listed running time of "2 hours."

Yang Zili

Yang Zili () ("ca." 1971—), also known as Yang Zi (), is a Chinese freelance journalist and webmaster, released in March, 2009 after having been imprisoned for eight years in the People's Republic of China for “subverting state authority.”
Biography.
Born in 1971, Yang was born to a rural Muslim family in Daming County, Hebei Province. He received an undergraduate degree from Xi'an Communications University (Xi'an Jiaotong University), and attended Peking University from 1995 to 1998, receiving a Master's Degree in mechanics (Mechanical Engineering).
Yang is also an amateur poet and has two known published poems, "Peasants - My Kinsmen" in 1998, and "The Ghost of Communism" in 2001, and is married to Lu Kun.
Social activism.
In early 1997 whilst at Beijing University, he co-founded the "Current Affairs Society", a student organization committed on discussion of social issues in China, which was banned several months later by school authorities.
In 1999, Yang and some close friends started to meet regularly and formed the "New Youth Society" to discuss social and political issues. Yang also started to publish his writings on his website, "Yang Zili's Garden of Ideas", hosted originally at lib.126.com. After the closure of the site the contents were recovered by HumanRightsAction.org. He wrote articles for his website that advocated political freedoms, criticised the crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement, and deplored the economic hardship of China’s peasants.
Imprisonment.
On March 13, 2001, Yang along with fellow "New Youth Society" members Xu Wei, Jin Haike, Zhang Honghai, were arrested by agents of the Ministry of State Security, and Yang was officially charged on April 20 with “subverting state authority.”
On September 28, Yang appeared before the Intermediate People’s Court of Beijing, and was sentenced by the court on May 28, 2003 to eight years in prison. The case was appealed and the verdict was upheld on November 10, 2003.
In February 2007, Yang's wife, Lu Kun, requested a review of his trial because of new evidence that former State Security Bureau agent Li Yuzhou's fellow agents and superiors altered the four reports he made in order to justify arresting Yang. The Beijing Intermediate Court turned down her request, but she filed a new request to the Supreme People's Court and is still awaiting its decision. He was released in March, 2009.

Z Force (Action Force)

Z Force is a fictional infantry conceived and designed by Palitoy that features in the 3 3/4 inch Action Force figure range; similar to the G.I. Joe action figures and featured in a comic book series.
Possibly based in-part on the Z Special Unit (also known as "Z Force"), a joint Australian, British and New Zealand commando unit, which saw action against the Empire of Japan during World War II, Z Force was part of the Palitoy range called Action Force and later depicted in the "Battle Action Force" comic books.
Graphic representation.
Z Force was released as part of the second generation of Action Force. Taking the form of a limited number of action figures and vehicles released in two waves, the unit was expanded with back-stories in "Battle Action Force".
Z Force has been described as: "The infantry backbone of Action Force, well supported by heavy armour and artillery"
The unit had distinctive green and black camouflage (notwithstanding their occasional deployment in desert and other terrain) with a red 'Z' insignia (in military-style stencil typeface) and occasional other red detail.
Z Force fought alongside their fellow Action Force units SAS Force, Q Force and Space Force most often against their Red Shadows enemy but also, on occasions, other fictional and non-fictional terrorist or para-military factions including "The Mamba Men", the "Gibli" and Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
As the range evolved in the early 1980s ("see Action Force - Third generation") Z Force operated alongside the more prevalent G.I. Joe-influenced 'AF' against the new enemy Cobra and were limited to only cameo appearances in later "Battle Action Force" storylines.
The figures were, in keeping with much of the second generation of Action Force, repaints and repackages of existing G.I. Joe figures and vehicles as well as some first generation toys (e.g. the jeep vehicle was a re-paint of the AF-3 jeep).

Bernd Fasching

Bernd Fasching (born 18 July 1955 in Vienna, Austria) is an Austrian painter and sculptor. He lives and works in Vienna.
Life and work.
In 2000 Fasching opened his project "Westwerk" ("a western investigation of the occidental culture") in the more than 800 years old Vienna St. Stephan’s Cathedral. The project consisted of his sculptures, paintings and other work. 
A constantly recurring, central element in Fasching’s work is the creation of his pieces of art amidst his visitors and audience. There were 7 periods between 1987 and 2006 when, under the title "12 Tage 12 Nächte/12 Days 12 Nights", Fasching lived and worked in various galleries around the world, where he could be observed at work and was always open to discussions. During this time he did not leave the place of work. Fasching created 12 paintings with themes inspired by the talks with the visitors to his work sessions. For each of the seven stations of the project (1987), Amsterdam (1990), Cologne (1991), Zurich (1992), Jerusalem (1994), New York (1997) and finally Vienna again (2006) a special soundtrack was composed, which was played in the respective gallery for the full 288 hours of the project.
Fasching’s walk-in sculpture "Der Hammer des Thors/Thor’s Hammer", created in 1990 in the entrance hall of the "Austrian Museum of Applied Arts (Museum für Angewandte Kunst - MAK)", also emerged before the eyes of the museum’s visitors, thus enabling them to follow the process of creation. A further walk-in sculpture was created by Bernd Fasching in the Dominican Republic between 1996 and 1997. "Terra Nova", the title of this walk-in formation of sculptures, depicts the landing place of Christopher Columbus on the island as an incentive to reflect on the checkered, often terrible History of the American Continents.
Based on these pieces, Fasching created the series "Tools", making a sculpture of each of the tools required for sculpturing a monument. A bronze sculpture from this series, in the form of a spade, was revised by Fasching and turned into the "Diva Award", an Austrian prize for sensational real-estate projects, which has been awarded annually ever since its creation in 2002, with Bernd Fasching himself as one of the jury members.

Full Swing (game show)

Full Swing was a game show that combined general knowledge questions and the game of golf which aired on BBC1 for one series from 25 May to 27 July 1996. The programme was hosted by Jimmy Tarbuck with voice overs by Rosemarie Ford. The show was inspired by (and produced by the team behind) the BBC's popular "Big Break", which was based around snooker (and in turn, was influenced by ITV's long-running darts quiz, "Bullseye"). However, unlike the long-running "Big Break", "Full Swing" did not catch on and only ran for one series. 
Ratings.
The programme went out on Saturdays in an early evening slot (similar to the "Big Break" slot) but was axed after just one series due to poor ratings. A Christmas Special was recorded but never broadcast, due to the disappointing reception of the first series.

Hardware certification

Hardware certification is the process through which computer hardware is tested to ensure it is compatible with specific software packages, and operates as intended in critical situations. With ever dropping prices of hardware devices, the market for networking devices and systems is undergoing a kind of change that can be loosely termed as ‘generalization’. Big established enterprises like Cisco, Novell, Sun Microsystems etc., no longer manufacture all the hardware required in the market, instead they ‘license’ or ‘certify’ small hardware players operating out from countries like Taiwan or China.
The Certification Process.
Vendor Provided Certification.
To obtain certification, the hardware or software has to conform to a set of protocols and quality standards that are put in place by the original creator of technology. Usually the certification process is done by a “Certification partner”. Certification partners are selected by the original creators of the technology and these partners are given the authority to do the testing and certification process. After a product is found to be compatible, it is labelled as xxx certified where xxx is the name of the original creator of the technology. Vendors use a “label” on the products to advertise the fact of compatibility with the said technology.
The process of certification ensures that the products made by different manufacturers are standardized and are compatible with each other as indicated in hardware or software platform.
Third-party certification.
Third-party certification is undertaken by an independent body. To obtain third-party certification, the hardware or software has to confirm to a set of quality standards determined by the third-party.

Asclepias purpurascens

Purple milkweed ("Asclepias purpurascens") is a herbaceous plant species. It is in the genus "Asclepias", making it a type of milkweed. It is native to the Eastern, Southern and Midwestern United States similar to the range of the Common Milkweed ("Asclepias syriaca"). The plant gets its name from the flowers that first develop a pink color but then turn darker purple as they mature.
Uses.
Like other members of the milkweeds, several insects live off the plant, including the Monarch Butterfly ("Danaus plexippus"), the Milkweed beetle ("Tetraopes tetraophtalmus"), Large milkweed bug ("Oncopeltus fasciatus"), Small Milkweed Bug ("Lygaeus kalmii") and Milkweed Leaf Beetle ("Labidomera clivicollis"). Other insects and pollinators feed off the flower's nectar.
This species is sometimes cultivated in gardens designed to attract butterflies, but is less common than the light purple Swamp milkweed ("Asclepias incarnata") or the orange Butterfly weed ("Asclepias tuberosa"). The nectar of the plant attracts many other species of butterflies and insects as well.

Sadri Maksudi Arsal

Sadreddin Nizamettinovich Maksudov or Sadri Maksudi Arsal (1878–February 20, 1957) was a prominent Tatar and Turkish statesman, scholar and thinker.
Biography.
Sadreddin Nizamettinovich Maksudov was born in Taşsu, outside of Kazan, the son of a mullah, and the younger brother of Hadi Maksudi, the well-known Jadidist. After the traditional mektep and medreseh education, he took the (then) unusual step of entering the Russian Teachers' College in Kazan (for which he was much criticized by his community at the time), then studied law in Paris.
Four years later, in 1906, he returned to Russia and began political activities that displayed a liberal nationalist tendency. Maksudi became the leader of the Muslim faction in the Russian parliament.
Sadri Maksudi Arsal was married to Kamile, the daughter of the gold-mining Rameev family of Orenburg, had two children - Adile and Naile. 
He died in Istanbul in 1957. He was interred at the Zincirlikuyu Cemetery in Istanbul.
Political Career in Imperial Russia.
On his return to Russia in 1906, thanks to the rights conferred in 1905 to all the subjects of the Czar, he entered politics in order to voice issues concerning the Tatar people and the Muslim community. He found himself elected at a very young age as a deputy of the (liberal) Kadet Party to the II. and III. Dumas. At the Duma, he favored a centrally administered cultural autonomy for all Russia's Muslims until it was apparent that the Volga Tatars, who mainly promoted this solution, had been abandoned by the other Turkic Muslims of the Russian Empire.
Political Leader/Statesman – Maksudi was the leader of the first state formation (in the 20th century) in his native Idel-Ural State since the fall of the Kazan Khanate to the Moscovite princedom in 1552. Like all the other peoples within czarist Russia, the Turkic peoples of Russia undertook political ventures with the advent of the 1917 Revolution. After the various “Moslem congresses” taking place in 1917, during which different and conflicting opinions were expressed concerning the political future of the Turkic peoples of Russia, the “National-Cultural Autonomy of the Turco-Tatars of Inner Russia and Siberia” was proclaimed in Ufa (in present-day Bashkortostan) on 22 July 1917, with a constitution drafted by Maksudi. General elections were held soon thereafter and a National Assembly (Milli Meclis) was convened in November. Maksudi was elected its president. The formation of a “National Council” composed of three ministries, also headed by Maksudi, followed. The autonomous government was gathering momentum with a project to turn itself into the independent "Idel-Ural State". But this was not to be. The Bolsheviks would not allow it. The National Assembly would stop convening and the National Council would be abolished by April 1918. After the defeat of the Tatar nationalists at the hands of Stalin and Tatar Communists, Maksudi emigrated to Finland. In 1919, he delivered a diplomatic note concerned with the demands of the Muslims of European Russia to the Versailles Peace Conference, along with Gayaz Iskhaki. In the early 1920s Maksudi was in Berlin where he began a scholarly career which he vigorously continued after he arrived in Ankara in 1925.
Academia.
Scholar/Academic - Settled for a time in Paris, Maksudi started teaching the history of the Turks at the University of Sorbonne. But a lecture tour he made in 1924 in the new Turkish Republic was to bring about a radical change in his life. In 1925 he received a letter from Hamdullah Suphi, then president of Türk Ocakları (Turkish Hearths/Cultural Centers) informing him that “Gazi hazretleri (His Excellency the Ghazi Atatürk)” was inviting him to Turkey. In Turkey, Ord. Prof. Sadri Maksudi Arsal (as he would become eventually) emerged as a multi-faceted thinker, a scholar whose work in the fields of law, history, philosophy, linguistics and sociology made a rarely found contribution to the world of ideas and scholarship during the founding years of the Turkish Republic. A major figure in national history (he would be nominated a candidate at the presidential elections in 1950), Arsal tried to propagate his ideas through his books, scholarly writings, newspaper articles, lectures at the university, and speeches at the parliament.
Man of law – A graduate of the Paris Faculty of Law, Arsal was one of the founding faculty members of the Ankara School of Law (as it was then called) opened in 1925. He taught for many years in that faculty then later at Istanbul University. His "Hukukun Umumi Esasları" (General Principles of Law, 1937), "Hukuk Tarihi Dersleri" (Lectures in the History of Law, 1938)," Umumi Hukuk Tarihi" (History of General Law, 1941), "Hukuk Felsefesi Tarihi" (History of the Philosophy of Law, 1946), and "Türk Tarihi ve Hukuk" (Turkish History and Law, 1947) have been valuable contributions to the development of the teaching of law in Turkey. However, his major contribution to legal studies has been his establishing the discipline of History of Turkish Law, a course which is today a standard element in legal studies curricula in Turkey. He laid the foundations of this course, and taught it for the first time in the world.
Political Career in the Republic of Turkey.
He had a second career in Turkey, where he was invited to help build the newly founded Republic (and where he adopted the additional surname, "Arsal"), as a close associate of Kemal Atatürk, contributing to the language reform as well as to the turn Turkish historiography would take, while at the same time serving as a member of parliament, and pursuing an academic career as a member of the faculties of law of Ankara and Istanbul universities from which he would retire as an "ordinarius professor."
Member of Parliament - A frequent guest at Atatürk's dinner table during meals that functioned as workshops or "fora"; or, put in another way, one of the persons whose advice Atatürk sought, Arsal was twice a member of parliament during the one-party period: a representative of Şebinkarahisar between 1931 and 1935, and of Giresun between 1935 and 1939. He devoted himself totally to academic life after that, with the one exception between 1950 and 1954 when he was elected as a Demokrat Parti deputy representing Ankara.
Influence (Scholar and Political).
His influence on the establishment of the Language and Historical Societies – Arsal played a decisive role in the establishment of both the Society for the Study of the Turkish Language (later the Turkish Language Institution), and the Society for the Study of Turkish History (later Turkish Historical Institution). He authored much of "Türk Tarihinin Anahatları" (Outlines of Turkish History, 1930), that reflected the official history of the period. Arsal has also made a major contribution to the language reform. He collected his essays on the subject in a volume titled "Türk Dili İçin" (For the Turkish Language, 1930), a work that was a turning point for the language reform and which Atatürk endorsed by writing a preface. Some of Atatürk's compendious statements in that preface are oft repeated in our day and have been engraved on the inscription that is in front of the Türk Dil Kurumu (Turkish Language Institute) building in Ankara.
Nationalist - Arsal's last endeavor was to publish in 1955 "Milliyet Duygusunun Sosyolojik Esasları" (Sociological Bases of the Nationalist Feeling) which he called his "spiritual testament." Putting on paper a lifetime's study and reflection, Arsal discussed in this work the concept of nationality and developed a modern theory of nationalism. In the book, he argues that contemporary nationalism should distance itself from chauvinism and, just like the religious sphere did, adopt a rational stance.

Balaam and the Angel is a rock band formed in Cannock, England, during 1984.
The three founding members of the band, the Morris brothers, are Scottish. As children in Motherwell, they worked in the entertainment industry as part of a cabaret act. They moved south to England to Cannock, Staffordshire, where they formed Balaam and the Angel.
Initially the band self-released a series of EP's via their own Chapter 22 label and played some tour dates opening for The Cult. This saw Balaam and the Angel catch the attention of Virgin Records, who signed them and released their debut album, "The Greatest Story Ever Told". It peaked at No. 67 in the UK Albums Chart in August 1986. They toured in the United States with The Mission, Kiss and label mate Iggy Pop.
A second guitarist, and the first non-sibling, Ian McKean, was added to the band in 1988. The band began to move away from gothic rock music styles into a sound that had more in common with hard rock. With their new-found style, they recorded the album "Live Free or Die". This was soon followed up in similar style when they recorded "Days of Madness", before being dropped by Virgin Records. Their song "I'll Show You Something Special" appeared on the soundtrack for the film, "Planes, Trains and Automobiles".
Since 1994, Balaam have used keyboard player Chris Williams (also known as Chris P Notes) in their live shows. Chris also plays keyboards on Jason Bonham's first band Airrace's second album, Back to the Start, released in 2011.

History.
Boris Yeltsin came to power with a wave of high expectations. On he was elected president of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic with 57% of the vote, becoming the first popularly elected president. But Yeltsin never recovered his popularity after a series of economic and political crises in Russia in the 1990s. The Yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. By the time he left office, Yeltsin had an approval rating of two percent by some estimates.
Throughout his presidential terms and into his second term as Prime Minister, Putin has enjoyed high approval ratings amongst the Russian public. During his eight years in office, the economy bounced back from crisis, seeing GDP increase sixfold (72% in PPP), poverty cut more than half and average monthly salaries increase from $80 to $640, or by 150% in real rates. At the same time, his conduct in office has been questioned by domestic dissenters, as well as foreign governments and human rights organizations, for his handling of internal conflicts in Chechnya and Dagestan, his record on internal human rights and freedoms, his relations with former Soviet Republics, and his relations with the so-called oligarchs: Russian businessmen with a high degree of power and influence within both the Russian Government and economy. This was seen by the Kremlin as a series of anti-Russian propaganda attacks orchestrated by western opponents and exiled "oligarchs".

Infrared heater

An infrared heater or heat lamp is a body with a higher temperature which transfers energy to a body with a lower temperature through electromagnetic radiation. Depending on the temperature of the emitting body, the wavelength of the peak of the infrared radiation ranges from to 1 mm. No contact or medium between the two bodies is needed for the energy transfer. Infrared heaters can be operated in vacuum or atmosphere.
One classification of infrared heaters is by the wavelength bands of infrared emission.
History.
British astronomer Sir William Herschel is credited with the discovery of infrared in 1800. He made an instrument called a spectrometer to measure the magnitude of radiant power at different wavelengths. This instrument was made from three pieces. The first was a prism to catch the sunlight and direct and disperse the colors down onto a table, the second was a small panel of cardboard with a slit wide enough for only a single color to pass through it and finally, three mercury-in-glass thermometers. Through his experiment Hershel found that red light had the highest degree of temperature change in the light spectrum, however, infrared heating was not commonly used until World War II. During World War II infrared heating became more widely used and recognized. The main applications were in the metal finishing fields, particularly in the curing and drying of paints and lacquers on military equipment. Banks of lamp bulbs were used very successfully but by today's standards, the power intensities were very low. The technique offered much faster drying times than the fuel convection ovens of the time. Production bottlenecks were mitigated and military supplies to the armed forces were maintained. After World War II the adoption of infrared heating techniques continued but on a much slower basis. In the mid 1950s the motor vehicle industry began to show interest in the capabilities of infrared for paint curing and a number of production line infrared tunnels came into use.
Elements.
The most common filament material used for electrical infrared heaters is tungsten wire, which is coiled to provide more surface area. Low temperature alternatives for tungsten are carbon, or alloys of iron, chromium, and aluminum (trademark and brand name "Kanthal"). While carbon filaments are more fickle to produce, they heat up much more quickly than a comparable medium-wave heater based on a FeCrAl filament.
Industrial infrared heaters sometimes use a gold coating on the quartz tube that reflects the infrared radiation and directs it towards the product to be heated. Consequently the infrared radiation impinging on the product is virtually doubled. Gold is used because of its oxidation resistance and very high IR reflectivity of approximately 95%.
Types.
Infrared heaters are commonly used in infrared modules (or emitter banks) combining several heaters to achieve larger heated areas.
Infrared heaters are usually classified by the wavelength they emit. Near infrared (NIR) or short-wave infrared heaters operate at high filament temperatures above and when arranged in a field reach high power densities of some hundreds of kW/m. Their peak wavelength is well below the absorption spectrum for water, making them unsuitable for many drying applications. They are well suited for heating of silica where a deep penetration is needed.
Medium-wave and carbon (CIR) infrared heaters operate at filament temperatures of around . They reach maximum power densities of up to (medium-wave) and (CIR).
Far infrared emitters (FIR) are typically used in the so-called low-temperature far infrared saunas. These constitute only the higher and more expensive range of the market of infrared sauna. Instead of using carbon, quartz or high watt ceramic emitters, which emit near and medium infrared radiation, heat and light, far infrared emitters use low watt ceramic plates that remain cold, while still emitting far infrared radiation.
The relationship between temperature and peak wavelength is expressed by Wien's displacement law.
Metal wire element.
Metal wire heating elements first appeared in the 1920s. These elements consist of wire made from chromel. Chromel is made from nickel and chrome and it is also known as nichrome. This wire was then coiled into a spiral and wrapped around a ceramic body. When heated to high temperatures it forms a protective layer of chromium-oxide which protects the wire from burning and corrosion, this also causes the element to glow.
Heat lamps.
A heat lamp is an incandescent light bulb that is used for the principal purpose of creating heat. The spectrum of black body radiation emitted by the lamp is shifted to produce more infrared light. Many heat lamps include a red filter to minimize the amount of visible light emitted. Heat lamps often include an internal reflector.
Heat lamps are commonly used in shower and bathrooms to warm bathers and in food-preparation areas of restaurants to keep food warm before serving. They are also commonly used for animal husbandry. Lights used for poultry are often called brooding lamps. Aside from young birds, other types of animals which can benefit from heat lamps include reptiles, amphibians, insects, arachnids, and the young of some mammals.
The sockets used for heat lamps are usually ceramic because plastic sockets can melt or burn when exposed to the large amount of waste heat produced by the lamps, especially when operated in the "base up" position. The shroud or hood of the lamp is generally metal. There may be a wire guard over the front of the shroud, to prevent touching the hot surface of the bulb.
Ordinary household white incandescent bulbs can also be used as heat lamps, but red and blue bulbs are sold for use in brood lamps and reptile lamps. 250-watt heat lamps are commonly packaged in the "R40" (5" reflector lamp) form factor with an intermediate screw base.
Heat lamps can be used as a medical treatment to provide dry heat when other treatments are ineffective or impractical.
Ceramic infrared heat systems.
Ceramic infrared heating elements are used in a diverse range of industrial processes where long wave infrared radiation is required. Their useful wavelength range is 2–10 µm. They are often used in the area of animal/pet healthcare too. The ceramic infrared heaters (emitters) are manufactured with three basic emitter faces: trough (concave), flat, and bulb or Edison screw element for normal installation via an E27 ceramic lamp holder.
Far-infrared.
This heating technology is used in some expensive infrared saunas. It is also found in space heaters. These heaters use low watt density ceramic emitters (usually fairly big panels) which emit long wave infrared radiation. Because the heating elements are at a relatively low temperature, far-infrared heaters do not give emissions and smell from dust, dirt, formaldehyde, toxic fumes from paint-coating, etc. This has made this type of space heating very popular among people with severe allergies and multiple chemical sensitivity in Europe. Because far infrared technology does not heat the air of the room directly, it is important to maximize the exposure of available surfaces which then re-emit the warmth to provide an even all round ambient warmth.
Quartz heat lamps.
Halogen lamps are incandescent lamps filled with highly pressurized halogen gas. This gas is combined with a small amount of bromine or iodine which causes tungsten atoms to regenerate by lessening the evaporation of the filament. This leads to a much longer life of halogen lamps than incandescent lamps. Due to the high pressure and temperature halogen lamps produce, they are relatively small and made out of quartz glass because it has a hotter melting point than standard glass. Common uses for halogen lamps are table top heaters.
Quartz infrared heating elements emit medium wave infrared energy and are particularly effective in systems where rapid heater response is required. Tubular infrared lamps in quartz bulbs produce infrared radiation in wavelengths of 1.5–8 µm. The enclosed filament operates at around , producing more shorter-wavelength radiation than open wire-coil sources. Developed in the 1950s at General Electric, these lamps produce about () and can be combined to radiate 500 watts per square foot (). To achieve even higher power densities, halogen lamps were used. Quartz infrared lamps are used in highly polished reflectors to direct radiation in a uniform and concentrated pattern.
Quartz heat lamps are used in food processing, chemical processing, paint drying, and thawing of frozen materials. They can also be used for comfort heating in cold areas, in incubators, and in other applications for heating, drying, and baking. During development of space re-entry vehicles, banks of quartz infrared lamps were used to test heat shield materials at power densities as high as 28 kilowatts/square foot (300 kW/m2).
Most common designs consist of either a satin milky-white quartz glass tube or clear quartz with an electrically resistant element, usually a tungsten wire, or a thin coil of iron-chromium-aluminum alloy. The atmospheric air is removed and filled with inert gases such as nitrogen and argon then sealed. In quartz halogen lamps, a small amount of halogen gas is added to prolong the heater's operational life.
Much of the infrared and visible energy released is caused by the direct heating of the quartz material, 97% of the near infrared is absorbed by the silica quartz glass tube causing the temperature of the tube wall to increase, this causes the silicon-oxygen bond to radiate far infrared rays. Quartz glass heating elements were originally designed for lighting applications, but when a lamp is at full power less than 5% of the emitted energy is in the visible spectrum.
Quartz tungsten.
Quartz tungsten infrared heaters emit medium wave energy reaching operating temperatures of up to (medium wave) and (short wave). They reach operating temperature within seconds. Peak wavelength emissions of approximately 1.6 µm (medium wave infrared) and 1 µm (short wave infrared).
Carbon heater.
Carbon heaters use a carbon fiber heating element capable of producing long, medium and short wave far infrared heat. They need to be accurately specified for the spaces to be heated.
Gas-fired.
There are two basic types of infrared radiant heaters.
Radiant tube gas-fired heaters used for industrial and commercial building space heating burn natural gas or propane to heat a steel emitter tube. Gas passing through a control valve flows through a cup burner or a venturi. The combustion product gases heat the emitter tube. As the tube heats, radiant energy from the tube strikes floors and other objects in the area, warming them. This form of heating maintains warmth even when a large volume of cold air is suddenly introduced, such as in maintenance garages. They cannot however, combat a cold draught.
The efficiency of an infrared heater is a rating of the total energy consumed by the heater compared to the amount of infrared energy generated. While there will always be some amount of convective heat generated through the process, any introduction of air motion across the heater will reduce its infrared conversion efficiency. With new untarnished reflectors, radiant tubes have a Downward Radiant Efficiency of about 60%. other 40% comprises unrecoverable upwards radiant + convective losses, and, flue losses.
Health effects.
In addition to the dangers of touching the hot bulb or element, high-intensity short-wave infrared radiation may cause indirect thermal burns when the skin is exposed for too long or the heater is positioned too close to the subject. Individuals exposed to large amounts of infrared radiation (like Glass blowers and arc welders) over an extended period of time may develop depigmentation of the iris and opacity of the aqueous humor, so exposure should be moderated.
Efficiency.
Electrically-heated infrared heaters radiate up to 86% of their input as radiant energy. Nearly all the electrical energy input is converted into infrared radiant heat in the filament and directed onto the product by reflectors. Some heat energy is removed from the heating element by conduction or convection, which may be no loss at all for some designs where all of the electrical energy is desired in the heated space, or may be considered a loss, in situations where only the radiative heat transfer is desired or productive.
For practical applications, the efficiency of the infrared heater depends on matching the emitted wavelength and the absorption spectrum of the material to be heated. For example, the absorption spectrum for water has its peak at around . This means that emission from medium-wave or carbon infrared heaters is much better absorbed by water and water-based coatings than NIR or short-wave infrared radiation. The same is true for many plastics like PVC or polyethylene. Their peak absorption is around . On the other hand, some metals absorb only in the short-wave range and show a strong reflectivity in the medium and far infrared. This makes a careful selection of the right infrared heater type important for energy efficiency in the heating process.
Ceramic elements operate in the temperature of producing infrared wavelengths in the 2000 to range. Most plastics and many other materials absorb infrared best in this range, which makes the ceramic heater most suited for this task.
Applications.
IR heaters can satisfy a variety of heating requirements, including:
Thus, IR heaters are applied for many purposes including:

Freedom in Fragments

Freedom in Fragments is a studio album by English guitarist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith. It was composed by Frith in 1993 as "a suite of 23 pieces for saxophone quartet", and was performed by the Rova Saxophone Quartet between February 1999 and January 2000 in San Francisco. The album was released on Tzadik Records' Composer Series in 2002. Frith does not perform on this album.
The "Freedom in Fragments" suite was also recorded in January 2008 by the ARTE Quartett, and released by Intakt Records (Switzerland) in January 2009 on a CD entitled "The Big Picture" by Fred Frith and ARTE Quartett.
Background.
"Freedom in Fragments" was commissioned by the San Francisco-based Rova Saxophone Quartet and was composed by Frith specifically for them while he was living at Big Sur, California. He wrote it as a suite of 23 short pieces, or "stories", that can be played as a whole, or in part, and in any given sequence. Frith wanted a composition "which could reach their narrative potential by a force of accumulation ... small stories that, when heard together, become big stories." 
Frith also composed the suite in a way that the music could be improvised: "The determining factor was the understanding that Rova wanted material which they could transform through improvisation. Most of the stories, therefore, involve some question about what might constitute musical freedom." One reviewer of the album stated that "he suite's greatest strength is the way it lets Rova crawl around their instruments, from the melodic ballads to noisy skronk." 
The "story" sequence performed here by Rova was created by Frith, although it is just one configuration of the work, and only 16 of the 23 pieces appear on the album. The entire work was dedicated to the memory of Charles Mingus, with certain pieces inspired by Frank Zappa, Jimmy Giuffre and Ikue Mori.

Wreath money

Wreath money is not a legal term, but the literal translation of German "Kranzgeld". "Kranzgeld" is money a man had to pay as compensation to a woman of "immaculate reputation" he was engaged to when he had sexual intercourse with her and then broke off the engagement (or caused it to be broken off e.g. through unfaithfulness). Immaculate reputation in this context meant mainly virginity, but could also be lost though other factors such as being convicted of a crime. 
The loss of virginity, it was assumed, would diminish the woman's expectations to gain a good match for a husband. Thus, the money is a form of legal damages.
The term refers to the wreath that a bride traditionally wears at her wedding. In some European cultures, notably Germany, a virgin bride was entitled to wear a wreath of myrtle flowers; a non-virgin bride, on the other hand, had to wear a wreath made of straw.
In Germany, "Kranzgeld" was regulated in paragraph §1300 of the family law, part of the civil code "Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch" published in 1896 and taking effect in 1900. After being long considered irrelevant, it was finally abolished on May 4, 1998, when the entire law was renewed, on the occasion of a trial in 1993 where the judges decided the law was outdated. A woman had then tried to sue for 1000 DM (in 2004 roughly €500 or $500), but the request was denied on the grounds of equal rights between man and woman.

The storyboards Jamie Hewlett had started for the accompanying music video before the switch were later included on the DVD "". The title is a reference to the time signature of the guitar riff that appears throughout the track.
Music video.
Although production for 5/4's music video never was never finished, a storyboard from Gorillaz' 2002 compilation DVD, "", includes an animatic for the now scrapped 5/4 music video. The video opens with a brief image of a woman masturbating, with her privates censored by an image of the Gorillaz logo. Her breasts includes a blue star on each one. It proceeds with Gorillaz performing for a crowd upon a raised platform (the platform is in the shape of a bone). Murdoc is playing with the band when he sees a group of women on a platform next to theirs; however, the platform is too far away to get to. Murdoc then takes off his clothes until he is in completely nude, then attempts to jump to the platform with the women on it, but he instead fails to reach it and he falls into the crowd below.

Ceiling rose

In the United Kingdom and Australia, a ceiling rose is a decorative element affixed to the ceiling from which a chandelier or light fitting is often suspended. They are typically round in shape and display a variety of ornamental designs.
In modern British wiring setups, light fittings usually use loop-in ceiling roses, which also include the functionality of a junction box.
Etymology.
The rose has symbolised secrecy since Roman times, due to a confused association with the Egyptian god Horus. For its associations with ceilings and confidentiality, refer to the Scottish Government's Sub Rosa initiative. Through its promise of secrecy, the rose, suspended above a meeting table, symbolises the freedom to speak plainly without repurcussion. The physical carving of a rose on a ceiling was used for this purpose during the rule of England's Tudor King Henry VIII and has over the centuries evolved into a standard item of domestic vernacular architecture, to such an extent that it now constitutes a term for the aforementioned circular device that conceals and comprises the wiring box for an overhead light fitting.

Crockford's Clerical Directory

Crockford's Clerical Directory (Crockford) is the authoritative directory of the Anglican Communion in the United Kingdom, containing details of English, Welsh and Irish benefices and churches, and biographies of around 26,000 clergy. It was first issued in 1858 by John Crockford, a London printer and publisher whose father – also named John – had been a Somerset schoolmaster. 
Crockford is currently compiled and published for the Archbishops' Council by Church House Publishing. It covers in detail the whole of the Church of England (including the Diocese in Europe), the Church in Wales, the Scottish Episcopal Church, and the Church of Ireland, and it also gives some information – now more limited – about the world-wide Anglican Communion.
Frequency of publication.
The first four issues came out in 1858, 1860 (with a supplement in 1861 and 1868. Crockford then reappeared biennially until 1876, when it began a long run of annual appearances which lasted until 1917. The next issue was a delayed 1918/19 edition, which had for the first time incorporated its main rival publication, the "Clergy List". Further issues appeared for 1920 and 1921/22; then between 1923-1927 and 1929-1940 the directory reappeared annually, followed by more late issues in 1941 and 1947/48. Since that time Crockford has generally appeared every two years, although gradually worsening delays meant that the 87th and 88th editions were dated 1977/79 and 1980/82, and the book failed to appear at all during 1983/84. Biennial publication was once again resumed in 1985/86, although the volume issued late in 1997 was designated the 1998/99 edition. The 100th edition – eventually published for 2008/09 – included within its hardback version a few facsimile pages from the first edition, together with an extended historical note describing some of the earlier volumes.
The 1858 edition was later described as seemingly “assembled in a very haphazard fashion, with names added ‘as fast as they could be obtained’, out of alphabetical order and with an unreliable index”. But nevertheless the 1860 directory “had become a very much more useful work of reference”. However the original volume was actually a consolidation of what in 1857 had been conceived as a mere series of supplements to an entirely different publication, the "Clerical Journal". The editors explained in the preface that they wished it to be understood that it was “but the foundation of a great work which, with the Cordial aid of the clergy, we shall hope to make more and more perfect every year”.
Scope of the directory.
The earliest editions had also gradually added some details of diocesan office holders and administrators, together with the theological colleges, and the royal chapels. They also acquired much fuller indexes – along with outline maps of dioceses, and increasingly-complete lists of bishops, dating right back to the earliest years of their sees. They further offered to all clergy an opportunity to list their publications, although these lists eventually had to be cut back as their overall length started to increase dramatically. 
By the early 1980s severe economies had become necessary and 1985/86 edition had to be restricted to the "home" churches of England, Scotland and Wales. Retired clergy were temporarily restricted to just a few details of their final appointment, although it became possible to restore the Irish clergy in time for the 1987/88 edition. Later editions saw a further return of the retired clergy, together with details of those overseas clergy who had originally been licensed or trained in the UK, or who occupied senior positions within their respective church hierarchies. Details which had also become obtainable from the "Church of England Yearbook" or from similar sources were generally excluded. 
By 1985/86 the first women deacons were being included, while other more recent innovations – from the 1990s onwards – have included optional email addresses, together with lists of those clergy who have died since the previous edition. Notes on "How to Address the Clergy" have been retained. A small number of clergy have been excluded at their own request. The Church Commissioners soon replaced the traditional black hardback bindings in favour of red and also introduced a separate softback alternative version. 
Since 2004 there has also been a frequently-updated Internet edition of "Crockford", which is available by subscription.
An alternative to the main work, "Crockford's Shorter Directory", focused almost entirely on the Church of England and omitting all past biographical details, was issued as a single edition in 1953-54.
Prefaces.
The well-known tradition of having an extensive but anonymous preface offering a general review of events within the Anglican communion – together with some occasionally sharp and controversial commentary – evolved gradually during the early part of the 20th century. Previous prefaces had tended to be much briefer and they had often been limited merely to explaining the directory’s in-house policies. After the events following the publication of the 1987/88 edition, which had ended with the death of Dr Gareth Bennett, this tradition of the anonymous preface was discontinued. 
An anthology "Crockford Prefaces: The Editor Looks Back", anonymously edited by Richard Henry Malden and covering the previous 25 years, was published by the Oxford University Press in 1947.
Locating previous issues.
County libraries each have their own policies, but there are good collections in a number of major academic and ecclesiastical libraries, including Lambeth Palace Library, Canterbury Cathedral Library, York Minster Library, the Guildhall Library and the Society of Genealogists. 
Besides the 1865 reprint, a small number of early editions have been reissued in CD format by various publishers, including Archive CD Books. Scanned copies of other early editions have also begun to appear on the World Wide Web.
Crockford references in fiction.
Crockford is referenced in Dorothy Sayers's 1927 detective novel "Unnatural Death" (chapter XI) where Lord Peter Wimsey uses "this valuable work of reference" in trying to trace a clergyman who is important for solving the book's mystery.
Another fictional character holding Crockford on his bookshelves was Sherlock Holmes, who during one of his final short stories ("The Adventure of the Retired Colourman"), consulted his copy before dispatching his colleague Dr Watson, together with another companion, to a distant part of Essex. There they interviewed “a big solemn rather pompous clergyman” who received them angrily in his study.

Clinical vampirism

Clinical vampirism, more commonly called Renfield's syndrome or Renfield syndrome, is an obsession with drinking blood. The earliest formal presentation of clinical vampirism to appear in the psychiatric literature, with the psychoanalytic interpretation of two cases, was contributed by Richard L. Vanden Bergh and John F. Kelley in 1964. As the authors point out, brief and sporadic reports of blood-drinking behaviors associated with sexual pleasure have appeared in the psychiatric literature at least since 1892 with the work of Austrian forensic psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. Many medical publications concerning clinical vampirism can be found in the literature of forensic psychiatry, with the unusual behavior reported as one of many aspect of extraordinary violent crimes. The behavior has never gained official recognition by the psychiatric profession and is not found in any edition of the "International Classification of Diseases" or the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders". However, in the more colorful era in the history of psychiatry that predated the 1980s rise of the bureaucratic hegemony of coded categories of (supposedly) theory-neutral mental disorders in "DSM" and "ICD", the psychiatric literature was fertile ground for the flourishing of case history reports of "uncommon psychiatric syndromes" or "extraordinary disorders of human behavior" that included not only clinical vampirism, but also lycanthropy, possession, stigmata and other unusual phenomena.
Renfield's Syndrome.
The alternate label "Renfield syndrome" is named after Dracula's human zoophagous follower, R. M.Renfield, in the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker. According to an interview conducted by psychology professor Katherine Ramsland with clinical psychologist Richard Noll, who coined the eponymous term in a 1992 book, he invented the term and its purported diagnostic criteria as a whimsical parody of the "new DSM-speak" of the psychiatry of the 1980s. In a public lecture hosted by Penn State University's Institute for the Arts and Humanities on 7 October 2013, Noll traced the 20-year trajectory of his unintentionally created "monster" from the moment of its creation as a parody of DSM mental disorders to the cultural popularity of Renfield's Syndrome today.
After Noll's book appeared in 1992 clinical vampirism has usually been referred to as Renfield's syndrome. In an NBC pre-Halloween special hosted by actor Peter Graves entitled "The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Vampires" that aired on 23 October 1994 (and is available on YouTube, with the 34:11 mark beginning the segment), pages from Noll's book were shown on camera as Canadian psychologist Leonard George summarized Renfield's syndrome for a wide television audience.
Characters suffering from Renfield's Syndrome have appeared on television. The first appeared in a 2005 episode of "" titled "Committed" (Season 5, Episode 21). It was also mentioned in 2009 in episode 7, season 5 of "Criminal Minds" entitled "The Performer".
In 2010 an 11-episode Canadian television series,"The Renfield Syndrome,""was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., but does not seem to have been aired.
On 15 August 2012 Renfield's syndrome was the subject of a video segment on "The Huffington Post" by Cara Santa Maria which again relied heavily on Noll's work and a recent scholarly article on the (pseduo-)syndrome published in the "Journal of the History of the Neurosciences".
In addition to references to Renfield's syndrome in the psychiatric literature and mass media, the horror writer Chelsea Quinn Yarbro published a story entitled "Renfield's Syndrome" in July 2002, which was then reprinted in an anthology that appeared the following year. It is also the title of a novel by J.A. Saare.
The twenty-year evolution of a "fang-in-cheek" 3-page book section that shot through the mass media and then—uncritically—into the pages of a peer-reviewed scholarly journal should serve as a cautionary tale about the purported validity of other "mental disorders." Philosopher of science Ian Hacking refers to this process as "making up people" and critiques medical and psychiatric elites for the untoward effects of their "dynamic nominalism" on individual lives. Such arbitrary categories create new natural "kinds" of people (e.g., perverts, multiple personalities and so on) that serve larger political, cultural and moral purposes and change with historical contingencies.
According to the case history reports in the older psychiatric literature that formed the basis of Noll's parody, the condition starts with a key event in childhood that causes the experience of blood injury or the ingestion of blood to be exciting. After puberty, the excitement is experienced as sexual arousal. Throughout adolescence and adulthood, blood, its presence, and its consumption can also stimulate a sense of power and control. Noll speculated that Renfield's syndrome begins with autovampirism and then progresses to the consumption of the blood of other creatures.
The usefulness of this diagnostic label remains in question. Very few cases of the syndrome have been described, and the published reports that do exist refer to what has been proposed as Renfield's syndrome through the use of official psychiatric diagnostic categories such as schizophrenia or as a variety of paraphilia. A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. Serial killers Peter Kürten and Richard Trenton Chase were both called "vampires" in the tabloids after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. Similarly, in 1932, an unsolved murder case in Stockholm, Sweden was nicknamed the "Vampire murder", due to the circumstances of the victim’s death.
According to the DSM-like diagnostic criteria of the pseudo-syndrome, sufferers of Renfield's Syndrome are overwhelmingly male. The disorder is typically sparked by an event in childhood in which the sufferer associates the sight or taste of blood with excitement. During puberty, the feelings of attraction to blood become sexual in nature.
Renfield's Syndrome typically follows three stages. In the first, autovampirism or autohemophagia, the sufferer drinks his own blood, often cutting himself in order to do so. The second stage is zoophagia, which consists of eating live animals or drinking their blood. Obtaining animal blood from a butcher or slaughterhouse for consumption also falls into this stage.
In the third stage, true vampirism, the sufferer's attention is turned to other human beings. He may steal blood from hospitals or blood banks, or drink blood directly from a living person. Some people with Renfield's Syndrome commit violent crimes, including murder, after entering this stage.
Though Renfield's Syndrome is newly named and has not yet been accepted into the DSM, it is not a new disorder. Noll noted apparent references to the disorder in German psychiatrist Richard van Krafft-Ebing's 1886 text Psychopathia Sexualis and speculated that Stoker may have been familiar with Krafft-Ebing's work.
History and famous figures.
Clinical vampirism is named after the mythical vampire, and is a recognizable, although rare, clinical entity characterized by periodic compulsive blood-drinking, affinity with the dead and uncertain identity. It is hypothetically the expression of an inherited archaic myth, the act of taking blood being a ritual that gives temporary relief. From ancient times vampirists have given substance to belief in the existence of supernatural vampires. Four vampirists, including Haigh, the 'acid-bath murderer', are described. From childhood they cut themselves, drank their own, exogenous human or animal blood to relieve a craving, dreamed of blood-shed, associated with the dead, and had a changing identity. They were intelligent, with no family mental or social pathology. Some self-cutters are auto-vampirists; females are not likely to assault others for blood, but males are potentially dangerous. Vampirism may be a cause of unpredictable repeated assault and murder, and should be looked for in violent criminals who are self-mutilators. No specific treatment is known.
Because of the disease not generally being recognized and no current treatment is known, there are debates about the dangers of not being able to treat this disorder, as patients are potentially dangerous to society. 
Psychiatric and Forensic Contexts.
The usefulness of this pseudo-diagnostic label remains in question. Very few cases of the syndrome have been described, and the published reports that do exist describe clinical vampirism as behaviors that are subsumed under more conventional psychiatric diagnostic categories such as schizophrenia or paraphilia. A case of vampirism in Turkey reported in 2012 was discussed as an unusual feature of a patient diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. While not referencing the literature on Renfield's syndrome, two Irish psychiatrists surveyed the psychiatric literature on vampirism as evidence of a changing discourse in psychiatry from the narrative of case studies to the depersonalized discourse of checklist diagnostic criteria.
A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. Serial killers Peter Kürten and Richard Trenton Chase were both called "vampires" in the tabloids after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. Similarly, in 1932, an unsolved murder case in Stockholm, Sweden was nicknamed the "Vampire murder", due to the circumstances of the victim’s death. Clinical vampirism in the context of criminal acts of violence, as well as "consensual" vampirism as a social ritual, have been extensively documented in the many works of Katharine Ramsland. Others have commented upon the psychiatric implications of "vampire cults" among adolescents.

A complement receptor is a receptor of the complement system, a part of the mediated innate immune system. Complement receptors are responsible for detecting pathogens by mechanisms not mediated by antibodies. Complement activity is not antigen sensitive, but can be triggered by specific antigens. Therefore complement (a group of proteins in the serum that help achieve phagocytosis and lysis of antigens) is also part of the humoral immune system.

Patrul Rinpoche

Patrul Rinpoche (Wylie: "dpal sprul rin po che") (1808–1887) was a prominent teacher and author of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism.
Biography.
Patrul Rinpoche was born in Dzachukha, a nomadic area of Golok Dzachukha, Eastern Tibet in 1808, and was recognized as the reincarnation of Palgé Samten Phuntsok and was given the name Orgyen Jikmé Chökyi Wangpo. He took ordination with Khen Sherab Zangpo. With Dola Jikmé Kalzang, Jikmé Ngotsar, Gyalsé Shenpen Thayé and other teachers, he studied Longchen Rabjam's "Trilogy of Finding Comfort and Ease", "The Way of the Bodhisattva" ("Bodhicaryavatara"), "Secret Essence (Guhyagarbha) Tantra" and many other works related to sutra and tantra, as well as the ordinary sciences. From Shechen Öntrul Thutob Namgyal, he received the reading transmission for the Translated Word of the Buddha (Kangyur) and teachings on Sanskrit grammar. He received the transmissions for the Kangyur and Tengyur in their entirety, together with the writings of many masters of the old and new translation schools.
He received instruction on the Longchen Nyingtik Ngondro some twenty-five times from Jikmé Gyalwé Nyugu, and Patrul Rinpoche completed the required practices the same number of times. In addition, he received instruction on "tsa-lung" practice and Dzogchen, and studied many of the cycles of practice found in the canonical scriptures ("kama") of the Nyingma Vajrayana. Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje introduced him to the pure awareness of rigpa while exhibiting wild and eccentric behaviour. He trained for a long time in the Longchen Nyingtik "tsa-lung" practices, and he received many teachings from Dzogchen Rinpoche Mingyur Namkhé Dorje and other masters.
While remaining for long periods near Dzogchen Monastery in the isolated hermitages of Rudam, such as the Yamantaka Cave and the Long Life cave, he put his energy into the practice of meditation and, it is said, attained a realization that was as vast as space
From the age of thirty, he travelled to Serthar, Yarlung Pemako and other places, teaching extensively on the "Secret Essence Tantra". To assemblies in Serthar and in the upper and lower regions of the Do valley he taught on "The Way of the Bodhisattva", "Mani Kabum", "Aspiration Prayer of Sukhavati" and so on. He made efforts to put an end to robbery and banditry and abolished the custom of serving meat at special gatherings. He also went to Dzamthang and studied the Six Yogas with Tsangpa Ngawang Chöjor, and he went to Minyak, where he had extensive discussions with Dra Geshe Tsultrim Namgyal on the prajnaparamita and other topics.
In Shri Singha college at Dzogchen Monastery and at Pemé Thang and other places, he turned the wheel of Dharma uninterruptedly, teaching on the treatises of Maitreya, the Middle way, Abhidharma, "Secret Essence Tantra", "Treasury of Precious Qualities", "Ascertainment of the Three Vows" and other topics. In particular, when he taught on "The Way of the Bodhisattva" in the vicinity of Dzogchen Shri Singha for several years in succession, large numbers of flowers called Serchen, with between thirty and fifty petals, blossomed all of a sudden, and they became known as ‘bodhicharyavatara flowers.’
He went to Kathok Dorje Den, where he offered prostrations and 'circumambulated' (Wylie: "skor ba") the reliquaries of the three great masters Dampa Deshek, Tsangtön Dorje and Jampa Bum. At the request of Situ Choktrul Chökyi Lodrö and others, he gave extensive explanations on "The Way of the Bodhisattva" to the whole assembly of monks. He went to major monasteries of the Riwo Gendenpa tradition such as Sershul, Labtridu, Chuhor and others and taught elaborately on "The Way of the Bodhisattva" and other topics.
Patrul Rinpoche established a teaching centre in the vicinity of Dzagyal Monastery and he repaired the large complex of walls of ‘mani stones' (Wylie: "do-bum") built by his previous incarnation Palge Samten Phuntsok, which thereafter became known as the Patrul Dobum.
His disciples included masters of the Nyingma school such as Kathok Situ Choktrul Chökyi Lodrö, the Fifth Dzogchen Rinpoche Thubten Chökyi Dorje, Gyarong Namtrul Kunzang Thekchok Dorje, the second and third Dodrupchens, Jikme Phuntsok Jungne and Jikmé Tenpe Nyima, Dechen Rigpé Raldri, who was the son of Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje, Khenpo Shenga, Adzom Druktrul Droddul Dorje, Tertön Sogyal Lerab Lingpa, Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso, Khenpo Pema Vajra, Nyoshul Lungtok, Alak Dongak Gyatso and others. In addition, his disciples included many masters of the Sakya, Gelugpa and Kagyü schools, such as Sershul Lharampa Thubten, Palpung Lama Tashi Özer and Ju Lama Drakpa Gyaltsen.
Patrul Rinpoche died on the eighteenth day of the fourth lunar month in the Fire Pig year of the fifteenth calendrical cycle (1887).
Patrul Rinpoche's writings were not collected by the master himself or by his attendants, and thus many of them were never carved into printing blocks. Those which were printed and which are now to be found comprise six volumes. These include works of various styles and genres, including commentaries on and structural outlines (sa bcad) for the treatises of Maitreya, "The Way of the Bodhisattva", "Treasury of Precious Qualities" and other texts, like "The Words of My Perfect Teacher", and miscellaneous writings including "The Drama in the Lotus Garden", which was written to console a young nobleman from Derge called Trashi Deleg whose young bride had been killed in an epidemic.
The essence of his teachings.
Use the time of your life.
Develop your inner happiness.
Recognize the impermanence
of all outer pleasure.
Live as a Yogi

Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta

The Alfa Romeo 158/159, also known as the "Alfetta" ("Little Alfa" in Italian), is one of the most successful racing cars ever produced. The 158 and its derivative, the 159, took 47 wins from 54 Grands Prix entered. It was originally developed for the pre-World War II voiturette formula (1937) and has a 1.5 litre straight-8 supercharged engine. Following World War II, the car was eligible for the new Formula One introduced in 1947. In the hands of drivers such as Nino Farina, Juan-Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli, it dominated the first two seasons of the World Championship of Drivers.
Overview.
The first version of this successful racing car, the 158, was made during 1937/1938. The main responsibility for engineering was given to Gioacchino Colombo.
The car's name refers to its 1.5 litre engine and eight cylinders. The voiturette class was for racing cars with 1.5 litre engines, standing in the same relation to the top 'Grand Prix' formula (usually for 3 litre engines) as the GP2 series does to Formula One today. Alfa's 3 litre racing cars in 1938 and 1939 were the Tipo 308, 312 and 316.
The 158 debuted with the works Alfa Corse team at the Coppa Ciano Junior in August 1938 at Livorno, Italy, where Emilio Villoresi took the car's first victory. At that time the 1479.56  cc (58.0 x 70.0 mm) engine produced around at 7000 rpm.
with the help of a single-stage Roots blower. More success came at the Coppa Acerbo, Coppa Ciano and Tripoli Grand Prix in May 1940.
Soon World War II stopped development of the car for six years. After the war the engine was developed further to push out in 1946.
In 1947, the Alfetta was put back into service. The new rules allowed 1500 cc supercharged and 4500 cc naturally aspirated engines. The 158 was modified again, this time to produce over and was denoted as Tipo 158/47. The car made a tragic debut in the 1948 Swiss Grand Prix where Achille Varzi lost control of his car and was killed. Another loss for the team came in practice for the 1949 Buenos Aires Grand Prix, where Jean-Pierre Wimille was killed in an accident (driving with Simca-Gordini).
In 1950, the 158 was eligible for the new Formula One European Championship. The car won every race in which it competed during that first season of Formula One; it was incredible that a car which had originated in 1938 was so victorious, most likely because all the other constructors (as few as there were) had less money to build and develop their cars and the Alfa had so much development time. The Alfa Romeo team included talented drivers such as Giuseppe Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio, the latter of whom later won the World Drivers' Championship five times.
At the end of the 1950 season, a further updated version known as the 159 was produced, which was used for the 1951 season. This version had reworked rear suspension, the old swing axle was replaced with a De-Dion axle and the engine produced around at 9600 rpm. But this amount of power out of a small engine with a big supercharger came at a price- it had horrendous fuel consumption. It did 1 1/2 miles to the gallon- compared to the Talbot-Lagos of the time which did 10 miles to the gallon. The reason for this was because the simplistically designed engine had been virtually unmodified, while bigger superchargers had been added over time. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone was the first Formula One Grand Prix not won by an Alfa primarily because Fangio and Farina both had to stop twice simply to re-fuel their cars- and the Ferrari of José Froilán González did better on fuel and would go on to win the race, with Fangio second. Still, the Alfa had the edge on performance and with wins in Switzerland, France and Spain, Fangio won his first of five championships that year. For their second-to-last World Championship race (until 1979), the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Alfa Romeo introduced a new evolution version known as the 159M, the "M" standing for Maggiorata ("enlarged").
After an unsuccessful bid by Alfa Romeo to obtain government assistance to meet development costs, the team announced their retirement from Grand Prix racing at the end of 1951. This, combined with problems for other Formula One teams lead to a decree by the FIA that all Grand Prix races counting towards the World Championship of Drivers in 1952 and 1953 would be for cars complying with Formula Two rather than Formula One .
The car's last Grand Prix win came in 1953 at Merano Grand Prix, Italy.

<doc id="9731231" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9731231" title="Sault Ste. Marie language resolution">
Sault Ste. Marie language resolution

The Sault Ste. Marie language resolution was a government motion passed on January 29, 1990 by Sault Ste. Marie City Council, the governing body of the city of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, which resolved that English was the sole working language of city government. The resolution ignited a national controversy which made the city a flashpoint in the Meech Lake Accord debate.
The Sault Ste. Marie resolution was not the first of its kind in Ontario, but Sault Ste. Marie was the largest municipality to pass such a resolution and bore the brunt of the controversy.
Background.
Sault Ste. Marie was originally founded by French-speaking missionaries in 1623 but had become overwhelmingly English-speaking by the twentieth century.
In response to a French-language education controversy which began in 1987 when a group of Franco-Ontarian families lobbied to have a new French school opened in the city, the Sault Alliance for the Preservation of English Language Rights (SAPELR) was formed and began circulating petitions to have this resolution passed by council. The group worked in concert with the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada (APEC), a lobby group which was concurrently campaigning against the provincial government's French Language Services Act. Although that law dealt only with provincial government services, APEC's strategy was to convince municipalities that they would be required to provide services in French, regardless of cost or benefit, in an attempt to convince the municipalities to pass this type of resolution. As a result of the schooling controversy, the SAPELR petition quickly garnered over 25,000 signatures.
The resolution was widely seen as retaliation for Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa's move to override the Supreme Court of Canada ruling that declared parts of Bill 101 unconstitutional. Bill 101 had declared French as the only official language of Quebec.
Text of the resolution.
"Whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie is composed of many different ethnic groups, languages and cultures;"
"And whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie has always shown respect for each of these cultures by providing preferential treatment for none;"
"And whereas the City of Sault Ste. Marie has throughout its history had one common working language for all of its written and oral communications, which is English;"
"And whereas the preferred common language of commerce, business, trade, science and normal everyday activities is English;"
"Now therefore be it resolved that the Corporation of the City of Sault Ste. Marie in the interests of maintaining goodwill, harmony and sound and responsible fiscal management continue as it has in the past to accept the use of English as the official language of communication with its citizens and with all levels of government, thereby demonstrating the concept of equality for each ethnic, cultural and language group in its jurisdiction."
"And further resolved in accordance with the Provisions of the Municipal Act of Ontario Part VII and more specifically Section 104a of Said Act the Council of the Corporation of the City of Sault Ste. Marie declares English to be the official language of the said Corporation."
Resolution passes.
On January 27, 1990, the city's daily newspaper, the "Sault Star", reported that council would debate the language resolution two days later. This triggered the attention of the national media, and with reporters from all across Canada in town to cover the debate, the resolution passed council 11-2.
Controversy.
Many political figures, including Brian Mulroney, Jean Chrétien and Ontario premier David Peterson, who had strongly condemned Premier Bourassa's use of the notwithstanding clause, expressed their opposition to the city's move. Both Peterson and his successor as premier, Bob Rae, refused to meet with mayor Joe Fratesi on several subsequent occasions, even to discuss unrelated matters.
In particular, the resolution was seen as a slap in the face to Quebec, where it was widely viewed as racist. (One Environment Canada meteorologist sent out a weather report for Sault Ste. Marie in which the forecast called for "a chance of flurries and Nazis", leading to her suspension.) Council defended the resolution, suggesting that Quebec's language laws and its refusal to abide by the Supreme Court ruling also constituted racism.
Council was also criticized for seemingly turning its back on the city's own history; although in modern times francophones are only a small percentage of the city's population, the city's history is intimately connected to early French Canadian missionary and voyageur exploration of the Great Lakes area. Some commentators also jokingly suggested that the resolution would require the city to change its name to St. Mary's Falls.
Entertainers weighed in on the controversy; on their 1991 album "Road Apples", The Tragically Hip criticized the resolution in the song "Born in the Water":
"Smart as trees in Sault Ste. Marie<br>
"I can speak my mother tongue<br> 
"Passing laws, just because<br> 
"And singing songs of the English unsung<br>
"How could you do it?<br> 
"How could you even try?<br>
"When you were born in the water<br> 
"And you were raised up in the sky?
Aftereffects.
Fratesi, who was viewed by Sault Ste. Marie voters throughout the controversy as standing up for the city's interests, was re-elected mayor in a landslide in 1991. He later became embroiled in a conflict of interest controversy in 1995 when he applied for the job of chief administrative officer of the city, while still sitting as mayor.
Quebec Premier Bourassa later passed Bill 86, which amended that province's language laws in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling, so the controversy died down.
On June 30, 1994, a court ruling struck down the English-only resolution as "ultra vires" the council's authority. On August 9, 1999, a resolution was brought forward under a new city council to strike down the resolution. The city's solicitor advised that the resolution was out of order given that a court had already struck down the resolution. Attempting to do what it could, the council then unanimously passed the following resolution:
"Moved by Councillor Derik Brandt"<br>
"Seconded by Councillor Sam Lepore"<br> 
"Whereas the "language resolution" was struck down by the courts because it was beyond the City’s authority; and<br> 
"Whereas it is not legally possible to rescind a resolution that has already been struck down by the courts;<br>
"Be It Resolved that a notation be added to the Minutes of the Regular Meeting of City Council of January 29, 1990 to include the following beside item 5(e); N.B. "This resolution was struck down by the courts on June 30, 1994 and therefore has no effect.""
The effect of the resolution was to amend the minutes containing the English-only resolution to note that the resolution had been struck down.
As recently as 2007, "The Gazette" in Montreal referred to the town of Hérouxville, then embroiled in a controversy around reasonable accommodation of immigrants, as Quebec's "own Sault Ste. Marie".

Generous (horse)

Generous (8 February 1988 – 15 January 2013) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse who in 1991 won both the Epsom and the Irish Derby. As a two-year-old he won three of his six races, most notably the Dewhurst Stakes as a 50/1 outsider. He finished fourth in the 2000 Guineas on his three-year-old debut, but showed vastly improved form when moved up to longer distances in summer. In a period of seven weeks he won the Derby by five lengths, the Irish Derby by three lengths and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes by a record seven lengths. His performances established him as one of the outstanding British racehorses of his era. After running poorly in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe he was retired to stud, where his record was disappointing.
Background.
Generous was a flaxen chestnut horse with a white star and snip bred by the Barronstown Stud in County Wicklow, Ireland. He was foaled on 8 February 1988.
Generous was sired by Caerleon, an American-bred colt who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup in 1983 when trained in Ireland by Vincent O'Brien. Caerleon sired many other good winners including Marienbard, Lady Carla, Cape Verdi and Warrsan. The success of Generous enabled Caerleon to claim his only British sires' championship in 1991. Generous' dam, Doff The Derby a daughter of the Preakness Stakes winner Master Derby who was a son of the 1970 Kentucky Derby winner, Dust Commander. Doff the Derby later produced the Epsom Oaks winner Imagine. As a daughter of Margarethen, Doff The Derby was closely related to the outstanding racemares Trillion and Triptych.
Generous was sold as a foal to the bloodstock agent Hamish Alexander for 80,000 Irish guineas. In the following year he was sent to the Goff's sale where he was bought for 200,000 Irish guineas by Fahd Salman. Then he was trained by Paul Cole at his stable at Whatcombe in Oxfordshire. Generous was ridden in six of his first seven races by Richard Quinn. In his last four races he was ridden by Alan Munro.
Racing career.
1990: two-year-old season.
Generous made his racecourse debut on 2 May at Ascot Racecourse when he contested a Graduation race (restricted to horses who had won no more than once) over five furlongs. Starting at odds of 6/1 against five opponents, he took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by half a length from Les Animaux Nuages with the future Diomed Stakes winner Sylva Honda in fourth.
In June, Generous was moved up in class to contest the Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Willie Carson he finished second to Mac's Imp. In August he was sent to Goodwood Racecourse for the Vintage Stakes in which he finished third behind Mukaddamah. Seventeen days later he was sent to Deauville Racecourse in France and made no impression in the Prix Morny, finishing tenth behind Hector Protector.
Generous was dropped in class on his return to England, where he was an easy winner of a minor stakes race at Sandown Park Racecourse on 18 September. Generous' final appearance of the season was in Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 19 October. He was given little chance and was sent off at odds of 50/1 in a field of eight runners. Quinn restrained the colt in the early stages before producing a strong late run to overtake Bog Trotter inside the final furlong and record an upset victory by three-quartes of a length.
1991: three-year-old season.
On his first appearance of 1991, Generous, whose preparation had been delayed by a hoof injury, contested the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile on 4 May. He started at odds of 11/1 and finished fourth of the fourteen runners behind Mystiko, Lycius and Ganges. After the Guineas, Paul Cole's stable jockey was replaced as Generous's rider by Alan Munro, reportedly at the insistence of the colt's owner.
On 5 June 1991 Generous, ridden for the first time by Munro, started the 9/1 fifth favourite in a field of thirteen for the 211th running of the Derby. Toulon and Corrupt started joint-favourites ahead of Mystiko and Hector Protector. Generous was settled in third place behind Mystiko before moving up to take the lead early in the straight. He quickly went clear of the field and won by five lengths from Marju, who finished seven lengths clear of Star of Gdansk and Hector Protector.
On 30 June Generous was sent to contest the Irish Derby at the Curragh in which he was matched against the leading French-trained colt Suave Dancer, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club. Generous took the lead half a mile from the finish and held off the challenge of Suave Dancer in the straight to win by three lengths. A month later, Generous was tested against older horses for the first time in Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. Starting the 4/6 favourite he took the lead early in the straight and pulled clear of the field to win by seven lengths from Sanglamore. The winning margin was the widest ever recorded in the race, surpassing Mill Reef's six length win in 1971.
On 6 October Generous started odds-on favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Racecourse. He pulled hard in the early stages and faded in the straight, finishing eighth of the fourteen runners behind Suave Dancer.
Assessment.
Generous was given a rating of 139 by the independent Timeform organisation, making him the highest-rated racehorse of the year. In their book "A Century of Champions", John Randall and Tony Morris rated Generous a “great” Derby winner, the sixteenth best British or Irish racehorse of the 20th century and the best racehorse in the world in 1991.
Stud career.
Generous was retired after the 1991 racing season to stud duty at Salman's Banstead Manor stud in England where he remained until 1995. He was sent to a breeder in Japan in 1996 where he sired 147 runners then to New Zealand in 1999. In 2002, he returned to Europe where he spent time at the Scarvagh Stud in Northern Ireland and the Sandley Stud in Dorset.
Generous was not a particularly successful breeding stallion. The best of his progeny was probably Catella, a German-bred filly who won the Group One Grosser Erdgas-Preis in 2000. His other good winners included Bahr (Ribblesdale Stakes), Copeland (Scottish Champion Hurdle) and Blueprint (Jockey Club Stakes).
Generous died in January 2013 at the age of twenty-five. Alfie Buller, the owner of the Scarvagh Stud, described him as "unbelievably intelligent for a horse, kind and truly regal... he will be sadly missed."

Sound-in-Syncs

Sound-in-Syncs is a method of multiplexing sound and video signals into a channel designed to carry video, in which data representing the sound is inserted into the line synchronising pulse of an analogue television waveform. This is used on point-to-point links within broadcasting networks, including studio/transmitter links (STL). It is not used for broadcasts to the public.
History.
The technique was first developed by the BBC in the late 1960s. In 1966, The corporation's Research Department made a feasibility study of the use of pulse-code modulation (PCM) for transmitting television sound during the synchronising period of the video signal. This had several advantages: it removed the necessity for a separate sound link and offered improved sound quality and reliability.
Awards.
Sound-in-Syncs and its R&D engineers have won several awards, including:
Versions.
Original mono S-i-S.
In the original system, as applied to 625 line analogue TV, the audio signal was sampled twice during each television line and each sample converted to 10-bit PCM. Two such samples were inserted into the next line synchronising pulse. At the destination, the audio samples were converted back to analogue form and the video waveform restored to normal. Compandors operating on the signal before encoding and after decoding enabled the required signal-to-noise ratio to be achieved. As the PCM noise was predominantly high-pitched, the compandor only needed to operate on the high frequencies. Also, the compandor only operated at high audio levels, so that modulation of the noise by the companding would be masked by the relatively loud high-frequency audio components. A pilot tone at half the sampling frequency was transmitted to enable the expander to track the gain adjustment applied by the compressor, even when the latter was limiting.
Following successful trials with the BBC, in 1971 Pye TVT started to make and sell the S-i-S equipment under licence. The largest quantities went to the BBC itself, to the EBU and to Canada. Smaller numbers went to other countries including South Africa, Australia and Japan.
Ruggedised S-i-S.
A ruggedised version of the system was developed, which provided about 7 kHz audio bandwidth, for use over noisy or difficult microwave paths, such as those often encountered for outside broadcasts.
Stereo S-i-S.
Later systems, developed in the 1980s, used 14-bit linear PCM samples, digitally companded into 10-bit samples by means of NICAM-3 lossy compression. These were capable of carrying two audio channels and were known as stereo Sound-in-Syncs.
ITV S-i-S.
The ITV network used coders and encoders produced by RE of Denmark. The two variations of Sound-in-Syncs used by the BBC and ITV were not compatible. The terms DCSIS or DSIS was commonly used in ITV to describe dual channel Sound-in-Syncs. Very often material carried was dual mono and not stereo.

Career.
Osborne attended Carson High School in Carson City, Nevada before he was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 1987 Major League Baseball Draft.
After declining to sign with the Expos, Osborne attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), where he played for the UNLV Rebels baseball team. Out of UNLV, Osborne was chosen by the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round (13th overall) of the 1990 amateur draft.
In the 1992 season, his major league debut season, Osborne finished fifth in MLB Rookie of the Year Award voting.
Osborne was the Cardinals' Opening Day starter in , and he consistently produced season ERAs below four despite recurring battles with injury. In , Osborne won 13 games for the Cardinals, made 30 starts for the only time in his career, pitched innings, and posted a 3.53 earned run average. He ranked among the National League top-10 in walks per nine innings, shutouts, ERA+, and strike-to-walk ratio.
At his peak, Osborne's arsenal included a low 90's fastball with late life, a plus changeup, and an average slider. His control was regarded as excellent, and he was known to throw his fastball to all four quadrants of the strikezone.
Ultimately, Osborne's career was derailed by a series of severe shoulder injuries. He was limited to 225 innings from to , and he spent the entire season rehabbing his left shoulder. When Osborne started for the New York Yankees in 2004, he became the first Yankee pitcher since Babe Ruth to start for the team after not having started a game for over five years.
Osborne signed with the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League for the season, played for the Bridgeport Bluefish in , and back with the Ducks in until his retirement on July 4, 2008.

John Fry (regicide)

John Fry (1609–1657) was a Member of the English Parliament and sat as a Commissioner (Judge) during the trial of King Charles I of England.
John Fry, son of William Fry of Iwerne Minster, was born in 1609. He was Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury in the Long and Rump Parliaments, sat through most of the trial of King Charles I, but did not take part in the sentencing, having been suspended from membership of the House of Commons and debarred from sitting on the High Court for heterodoxy on 26 January 1649, one day before the sentence was pronounced. The suspicion raised by Colonel Downes was that Fry did not believe in the doctrine of the Trinity. Eight days later Fry declared in a written statement that he respected the Trinity and was readmitted to the House. Shortly afterwards Fry published a pamphlet against Downes, "The Accuser Shamed", in which he expressed opinions far from orthodox. In 1650 Dr Cheynel of Oxford published a retort, to which Fry responded with another pamphlet, "The Clergy in their Colours". On 22 February 1651 Parliament decided to burn the two books and expelled their author. John Fry died in 1657. At the restoration in 1660 he was excluded from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act.

Lili Dehn

Lili Dehn, or Lili von Dehn, born Yulia Alexandrovna Smolskaia,
(Russian: ЮЛИЯ АЛЕКСАНДРОВНА фон ДЕН) (July 27 (O.S.)/August 9, 1888 (N.S.) - October 8, 1963), was the wife of a Russian naval officer and a friend to Tsarina Alexandra.
Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Dehn wrote a biography, "The Real Tsaritsa", to refute rumors that were circulating in Europe during the 1920s about the Tsarina and Grigori Rasputin.
Early life.
Dehn was born on her family's southern Russian estate, Revovka, a home of her ancestor General Mikhail Kutuzov, the victor of Napoleon during the 1812 invasion of Russia. Her parents were Ismail Selim Bek Smolsky and Catherine Horvat. Both sides of her family had a long history in Russia, according to her memoirs. Her parents divorced when she was eleven and her mother later remarried. Her maternal grandmother helped to raise her.
She was educated by tutors at home and wrote that she understood very little Russian as a child because her family spoke French. As a young girl, she enjoyed listening to folk stories of old Russia told by her maternal grandmother and her childhood nurse. "The peasants at Revovka were extremely superstitious, and they believed implicitly in witches and warlocks," wrote Dehn. Later, she had an English governess. She loved her childhood estate and, whenever she went to visit an uncle in Livadiya, took a bit of dirt with her from Revovka to remind her of home.
Marriage and friendship with the Tsarina.
Dehn married 1907 in Yalta, Carl Alexander "Joachimovitch" Akimovich von Dehn (1877–1932), a Russian naval officer whose family originally came from Tallinn, Estonia, from Finland and from Sweden. Dehn was an officer on the imperial yacht, Standart, and was a favorite with the imperial children. The Tsarina took an interest in Dehn's new wife and befriended her following the marriage.
The Tsarina was the godmother for the Dehns' son, Alexander Leonide, who was born on August 9, 1908, and nicknamed "Titi." Dehn wrote that Titi was baptized Lutheran, which was required by her husband's family to maintain an inheritance. Alexandra remained disturbed that her godchild had had a Lutheran baptism and insisted seven years later that the child must be rebaptized in the Russian Orthodox Church. The Dehns complied with her request.
Dehn was skeptical about the holiness of the starets Grigori Rasputin and the Tsarina's reliance upon him, but wrote that Rasputin once prayed over her own son, Titi, when the child was dangerously ill and the boy made a quick recovery.
World War I and Revolution.
Dehn trained to become a Red Cross nurse during World War I and nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital.
She was with the imperial family during the outbreak of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and helped nurse the imperial children and the Tsarina's friend, Anna Vyrubova, who was also Dehn's distant cousin, through an outbreak of measles. She witnessed the Tsar's abdication and the family's imprisonment by the new provisional government. Dehn left the palace and persuaded the government to place her under house arrest in her own home because her son Titi was dangerously ill.
Dehn wrote in her book that she blamed the Revolution on Jewish revolutionaries.
Exile.
Dehn escaped Russia aboard the ship SS Kherson with her mother and son Titi via Turkey and Greece. They eventually reached England. The family first settled in England, where the von Dehns had two more children, Ekaterina, or Katharina, or Catherine, in December 1919 and Maria Olga, or Marie, in April 1923. They later moved to a family estate, Holowiesk, in eastern Poland. Her husband died in 1932 and her daughter Catherine died in 1937. After World War II broke out, she was forced to emigrate again and ended in Caracas, Venezuela, where her daughter Maria, who spoke seven languages, later worked as an interpreter for the Venezuelan government. 
In the early 1950s, Dehn visited Anna Anderson, who claimed to be the rescued Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. Dehn said she recognized Anderson as Anastasia. "What can I say after having known her?" Dehn said after the meeting. "I certainly cannot be mistaken about her identity." Dehn died in 1963. 
Her son, Alexander, died in 1974 and her daughter Maria died in February 2007. Both left children and grandchildren. Today her daughter Maria's two children and four grandchildren live in the United States.

Shahram Jazayeri-Arab

Shahram Jazayeri () is an Iranian entrepreneur and businessman involved in a high-profile corruption case with several officials of the Islamic republic. He was also involved in fabrication of official documents. He had close ties with several high-ranking reformist clerics.
Jazayeri was taken into custody in 2001, at the age of 24, for a long-list of criminal activities involving bribery, illegal exports, forgery and massive embezzlement of state money and assets. At this time, as a student in Theran, his personal wealth was near $989,000,000. The cases of Jazayeri raised questions about the Iranian government's commitment to deal seriously with corruption. Jazayeri was convicted in 2002 in a major corruption case involving 50 defendants, many of them sons of prominent clerics. In September 2004, his 27-year prison sentence was partially overturned, and he was occasionally released from prison on leave.
Jazayeri paid huge amounts of money to the Iranian members of parliament. He confessed to paying about $15,600,000 to Hadi Khamenei, the Iran Supreme leader’s reformist brother, and about $5,800,000 to Mehdi Karroubi, former Majlis speaker without requesting anything in return. He was reportedly arrested after he sent a check worth $35,000,000 to the office of Supreme Leader of Iran.
In 21 February 2007, Iran's Special Judicial Complex for economic affairs declared that Shahram Jazayeri has escaped, while being transferred to a court-assigned financial expert committee. There was suspicion of governmental involvement in his scape as it was assumed unlikely to scape from such prisons without assistance. Hossein Shariatmadari of "Kayhan" newspaper wrote an article supporting the theory that those clerics were trying to cover-up the case. Following the escape controversy, the head of Judiciary, Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, fired a number of those responsible in the case, including the head of Evin prison and a few judges, and ordered an opening of a case in the military court for the judges. On March 19, 2007 Iran's head of intelligence agency confirmed that Jazayeri was arrested in an unnamed location in the Arabian Peninsula. His hiding location is said to be a remote village in Oman and handed over to Iranian authorities.
In 2007, an Iranian newspaper reported that, unlike ordinary prisoners in Iran, Jazayeri had access to a laptop and two mobile phones and is living in luxury in prison and continued his business works overseas.
In February 2007, Jazayeri was sentenced to 61,861,200 US dollars and 14 years of prison. In year 2008 he was seen several times in Dubai.

Percussion notation

Percussion notation is a type of musical notation indicating notes to be played by percussion instruments. As with other forms of musical notation, sounds are represented by symbols which are usually written onto a musical staff (or stave).
Percussion instruments are generally grouped into two categories: pitched and non-pitched. The notation of non-pitched percussion instruments is less standardized. Cymbals are usually notated with 'x' note heads, drums with normal elliptical note heads and auxiliary percussion with alternative note heads. Non-pitched percussion notation on a conventional staff once commonly employed the bass clef, but the neutral clef (or "percussion clef"), consisting of two parallel vertical lines, is usually preferred now. It is usual to label each instrument and technique the first time it is introduced, or to add an explanatory footnote, to clarify this. Below is an example of drum set notation.
Key or legend.
Each line and space of the staff is assigned a different part or "voice" of the drum kit and these are often laid out at the beginning of a piece of music in what is known as a "key" or "legend" or occasionally labeled when initially appear in the piece.
Below are two examples of Drum Legends as they would appear in the music:
Example 1: (Less common)
Example 2:
The notation program Sibelius (as seen in example 2) uses a system based on the recommendations of the Percussive Arts Society found in Norman Weinberg’s "Guide To Standardized Drumset Notation" (2002, ISBN 0-9664928-1-1).)
Drums.
Standard:
Extended to six toms:
Other.
Mounted triangle: ledger-line high C with "X" replacing notehead. Maraca: high-B with "+" replacing notehead. Mounted tambourine: high-B with "X" through conventional notehead.
Techniques.
All note letter-names in this section refer to the bass clef.
Rolls: Diagonal lines across stem (or above whole note). Open hi-hat: o above high-G X. Closed hi-hat: + above high-G X. Cross Stick: X in E snare space. Rim Shot: diagonal slash through note head. Brush sweep: horizontal line (replacing note head) in E snare space with slur to show brush is not lifted. (With stem this looks rather like a long "T" or a long inverted "T", depending which way the stem is going.)
Dynamic accents.
In percussion notation, accents are almost always to be interpreted as dynamic accents. Typically this involves emphasizing the accented note simply by raising the dynamic level.
The meanings of the different types of accents are not entirely standard. The image above shows the accent notations most commonly used by composers of percussion music.
The tenuto articulation is often used to indicate a slight raise in dynamic, less than a normal accent. Marcato markings typically indicate a more dramatic dynamic change. It is important to note that these markings have different meanings in traditional musical notation for other instruments.

Heraion of Perachora

The Heraion of Perachora () was a sanctuary of the goddess Hera situated in a small cove of the Corinthian gulf at the end of the Perachora peninsula. In addition to a temple of Hera of unusual construction and antiquity, the remains of a number of other structures have also been found, including a L-shaped stoa, a large cistern, dining rooms, and a second potential temple. The Sanctuary of Hera at Perachora is located 14.2 km NNW of Corinth, and 75.9 km W of Athens. Although there is debate between Argos, Megara and Corinth, the sanctuary was probably under the control of Corinth, as it faced the harbors of that powerful city across the Corinthian gulf. Cult activity at the site continued from perhaps the 9th century BCE to 146 BCE, when the Roman general Mummius sacked Corinth during the war with the Achaean League. In the Roman period, domestic structures were built on the site, indicating that the area was no longer a sanctuary. This site is significant for the study of the origins of Greek temple architecture and rural cults.
Mythology and history.
There is a legend recounted in Euripides that Medea buried her murdered children at a sanctuary of Hera Akraia as she fled from Corinth. This may be a reference to this site. Herodotus tells the story of Periander stripping the clothes off of the Corinthian women at a sanctuary of Hera. In the 1st century CE, the Greek historian Strabo wrote that there was an oracle associated with the sanctuary.
Archaeology.
The known structures of the sanctuary cover a rectangle approximately 45m NS and 245m EW. The sanctuary wrapped around a small cove and extended toward the east uphill along a ridge. The structures will be discussed in order from west to east.
West court.
At the extreme SW end of the sanctuary, there is a polygonal area of roughly 25 by 25m largely cut into the rock beside the cove. This structure has been variously termed the agora, or the west court. This structure may date to the 6th century BCE and thus be contemporary with the Temple of Hera Akraia. It appears to have been destroyed in the 4th century BCE; it has been proposed that the L-shaped stoa took over its function. There appear to have been colonnades on the western and southern sides. There are remains of a house from the Roman period roughly at the center of the area.
Apsidal structure and temple of Hera Akraia.
The earliest structure at the site was an apsidal building of perhaps the late 9th century BCE, which is thought to resemble the house-temple models known from the Argive Heraion. On that analogy, it would have had a high-peaked roof, covered perhaps in thatch. There were Early Helladic sherds under this structure.
In the 6th BCE, a Doric order tetrastyle-prostyle temple (c. 10 by 30m) was built a little to the west of the apsidal structure. The epithet Akraia refers to the position of the sanctuary at the point of the peninsula. The cella of this temple was divided into three aisles – a highly unusual design. There was a wall to divide the west end of the cella and a screen in front of the cult statue. Evidence for the reuse of some blocks may indicate that there was a prior phase of the structure in the 7th century BCE. The roof of this temple was of marble. No evidence has yet been found of pedimental sculptures.
The Doric order triglyph and metope frieze may have only extended along the eastern face, as few of the elements of this survive. The metopes were c. 15 cm thick and slotted into the triglyph blocks rather than forming a single block with them, as is more typical. Roughly in the center of the southern side of the temple was a c. 4.5m diameter limekiln used to reduce the marble of the temple (and of the sanctuary generally) into lime for the construction of the Hexamilion wall across the Isthmus of Corinth in the 5th century CE. Scorch mark remain visible on the stones of the temple around a circular area where the heat of the limekiln caused the breakdown of the underlying stones.
Triglyph and metope altar.
Fifteen meters east of the Temple of Hera Akraia, there was a stone altar decorated with a triglyph and metope frieze dating from the early 4th century BCE. This altar measured c. 2.5 by 4m. In the late 4th BCE Ionic columns were added to the corners, perhaps for a canopy.
L-shaped stoa.
Immediately east of the altar was a two-storied stoa with an L-shaped plan, also thought to date to the late 4th BCE. The eastern arm of the stoa was c. 16.5m north to south and c. 5.5m in depth, while the northern arm of the stoa was c. 17.5m east to west and c. 5m in depth. The lower level employed an external colonnade of the Doric order, while the upper floor used the Ionic order. This is the first known example of this combination. The stairs to the second floor are not preserved. A water channel extended to this structure from the hydraulic system east of the sanctuary.
Double-apsidal cistern.
Around thirty-five metres east of the L-shaped stoa, there was a c. 6 by 21m cistern with each end rounded off into an apsidal shape. Stone internal piers supported the vaults for the roof. On the eastern end of the structure there was a settling tank of c. 3 by 5m. Ten metres to the NE of the settling tank there was a diversion point in the water channel with one branch directed to the cistern and the other to the L-shaped stoa. The excavator dates the cistern to within the 6th to the 4th centuries BCE.
Dining rooms.
Immediately south of the cistern was a double dining room, probably associated with the cult activity at the site. This structure was initially identified as a Hellenistic house, but the cuttings for the legs of the dining couches make the identification as a dining room secure. Tomlinson proposes before 490 BCE as the date for this structure.
Sacred pool.
Around 30m east of the cistern, was a pool c. 2m deep though to perhaps have a sacred function within the cult. Significant numbers of mesomphalic phialai (libation vessels) were found within this structure. This structure is now backfilled and its exact location unknown.
The "Sacred Pool" features prominently in an effort by Tomlinson to reconstruct oracular practice at Perachora. He connected the phialai to divinatory practices and speculated that a ritual involving casting the phialai into the "Sacred Pool" would forecast good voyages for sailors stopping at Perachora after departing from Lechaion. Subsequent scholarship has not accepted this theory and Tomlinson views the pool as a simple reservoir.
Temple of Hera Limenaia.
Around seventy-five metres east of the Cistern lie the remains of a structure that dates perhaps to the 6th century BCE. During excavation a bronze bull was discovered, inscribed with Sikyonian letters and dating to the end of the 6th BCE. There was a hearth at the centre of the building. It may have been a house-temple or a dining room, as evidenced by spits for roasting meat found inside. Many diagrams and reconstructions of this structure show a door in the western side-wall; the gap in the stones, however, may have been created by a trial trench dug by an earlier excavator.
The "Temple of Hera Limenaia" was named by the original excavator, Payne, on the basis of an apparent inscribed dedication to "Hera Limenaia." For some time, scholars supposed that two separate cult centers existed at Perachora. John Salmon, inter alia, has argued convincingly that Hera's cult title at Perachora was Akraia, while Limenaia was a secondary epithet. More recently, Blanche Menadier has compared the epithet Limenaia to the Homeric epithet Leukolenos, also attested epigraphically at Perachora.
Remains outside the sanctuary.
Remains are known to extend for 1.7 km eastward from the Sanctuary to a lagoon. The best preserved of these constitute an extensive hydraulic system.
Rock-cut cisterns.
750m ENE of the sanctuary, there was a series of massive cisterns, reached by a rock-cut stairway extending c. 50m down into the bedrock. The opening of the stairway is 64m NW of the openings of the cisterns. The descent is steep and the steps are not all well-preserved. There are cuttings for a parapet wall around the vertiginous upper openings of the cisterns to prevent falls. It has been proposed that the water was raised from the cisterns to the water channel by the use of large human-powered waterwheels.
Fountain house.
540m ENE of the sanctuary, there was a hexastyle-prostyle fountain house (having six columns in its facade). Behind the facade there were three rock-cut basins, similar to the Pirene fountain house at Corinth. This structure was later incorporated into a rural villa in the Roman period. This fountain house is thought to date to the same time as the L-shaped stoa, which is the ultimate destination of the water of the system.
Aqueduct.
Water channels join the upper cisterns to the fountain house and the fountain house to the cistern of the sanctuary and the L-shaped stoa. At intervals there were settling basins along the water conduit, including one immediately above the fountain house.
Significance of the site.
As is the case for the rural sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron in relation to the religion of Athens, the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora is important for the study of rural cult in the Corinthia. The unusual plan of the 6th century BCE temple of Hera Akraia coupled with its location on the remains of a 9th BCE apsidal structure are of interest to the study of the development of the Greek temple as an architectural and cultic form. While it has been proposed that the cult of Hera Akraia had chthonic elements, this idea has not been generally accepted. The reference in Strabo to an oracle may fit with the idea that the children of Medea were buried at the site, and thus explain any chthonic elements to the cult as pertaining to a heroon.

Pé de Serra ("Mountain Foot" in English) is a Brazilian city in the state of Bahia. It is located in Sisaleira region, Microregion of Serrinha (Microrregião de Serrinha, in Portuguese). It was emancipated on March 20, 1985 and the population according to IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatísticas - Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statisticians) was 11,328 in 2005. The territorial area is 558 km².
The city of Pé de Serra is situated on the slopes of the mountain Lion. The city lies between the two main mountains, Lion and Bugi. The city has several towns which serve as urban centres in addition to the city centre itself.
History.
Tradition has it that three Portuguese brothers, exploring a vast region in search of fertile land in 1745, camped near Riachão do Jacuípe, which at the time was a cattle farm.
After some time of exploration, one of their dogs went missing and reappeared days later at the camp. It was given water and food. To everybody's surprise, the dog ate the food it was offered but didn't drink any of the water even though there was a drought at the time.
Suspicious of the dog's strange behaviour, the brothers began to observe it more closely. They noticed that the dog went into the underbrush of gravatá and was wet all over when it emerged again. A minadouro well was discovered at this location, and it was named as 'the heath at the foot of the mountain', from which the name “Pé de Serra" originates.
The city was emancipated on March 20, 1985 as a separate entity from Riachão do Jacuípe.
Demography.
The demographic trend of the municipality points downward. The population suffered a huge decrease, from 17,048 in 1991 to 11,727 in 2004. The most likely cause for this is internal migration to other more developed regions in Bahia, especially the metropolitan region of Salvador and Feira de Santana, and migration to other states, particularly São Paulo. 
The population of the Pé de Serra consists of people of white, brown and black skin colour. The white population is composed mostly of descendants of Portuguese, and also a few Spanish and Dutch, settlers. The blacks are tend to be descendants of slaves. 
The predominant religion in Pé de Serra is Roman Catholic, but other denominations are becoming more noticeable, especially evangelical Christians.
Culture.
The next cultural foot-de-serrense includes the orchestra filarmônica Community Association and Musical Lira August 6, in addition to the celebrations that happen in the council, as vaquejada, Corpus Christi, St. John and September 7. 
Some traditions are held in the city, such as the manufacture of carpets in the streets of the city centre on the day of Corpus Christi, burning of Judas on Saturday, Hallelujah and climb hills on Friday of the passion.
In the city there is still no cultural centers, such as theatres, cinemas, galleries, arts, museums, but it has some bars and educational institutions, besides the Acups (Cultural Association of foot-Sierra). 
The Mother Church, the Brejo the foot of the Sierra and a small chapel located in the Monte Belo can be considered monuments of the city. 
Economy.
The Prefecture and the National Institute for Social Security (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social,
INSS) are mainly responsible for the injection of resources into the economy of the municipality. Public bodies and INSS pensions are important sources of income for the economy of the municipality.
The economic activity of the municipality is based mainly on agriculture and livestock. Amongst the livestock industry, rearing of cattle, sheep, pigs and goats is prominent, but herds of horses, and donkey mules are also found. There are some farms where chickens are bred for trade with other municipalities.
The dairy council also contributes to the development of dairies whose products range from the traditional cottage cheese (skuta) to yogurt, in addition to increasing specialization in the production of cheese. This production, is chiefly marketed in the cities of Salvador, Feira de Santana, Camaçari and Juazeiro, all located in Bahia.
In agriculture, the main crops are sisal (also known as agave), beans, maize, cassava, vegetables and greens. However, the plantations are increasingly scarce in the rural area of the municipality because the booming livestock industry encroaches on the space available.
Other industries include an extraction plant, plantations for the growth of umbu fruit and forestry for firewood production.
Tourism.
There is little tourism activity in Pé de Serra. However, some cultural activities attract visitors from other regions of the country, particularly relatives of the local population living elsewhere.
On January 6, the feast of herdsmen (vaqueiros) and farmers takes place with massive participation of the local population and tourists, many attracted by the music shows, the Aboio tradition of drovers' songs, the races and the marching bands.
In March, visitors come to Pé de Serra for the now traditional marathon and civic pride parade, held to commemorate the anniversary of the council.
At Easter, the city changes. People come together in solidarity. There is a very strong tradition of Passion plays on Good Friday on Sierra Leon and some of the other mountains that surround the city. Moreover, the ascent of both local mountains, Sierra Leon and Monte Belo, provides an adrenaline rush and contact with nature for participants. So hundreds of people make this "pilgrimage" every year. It is also at this time that usually occurs at Micareta foot of the Sierra, called "Pascareta." 
In the afternoon of the Saturday of Holy Week, Charanga, the famous festival takes place, dragging a euphoric crowd through the streets of the town, dancing to the sound of sambas-de-washing, marchinhas of carnival and other melodies. At night, the festival finishes with the burning of "Judas" in a public square. This show is a particular attraction for tourists because it is not just a firework display but an explosion of joy stimulated by the excitement of the pyrotechnic display. Before the burning of Judas, his 'will' is read out, which is a review of events and the main characters that marked the previous year.

Jeanne Eagels (film)

Jeanne Eagels (also titled The Jeanne Eagels Story) is a 1957 American biographical film loosely based on the life of stage star Jeanne Eagels. Distributed by Columbia Pictures, the film was produced and directed by George Sidney from a screenplay by John Fante, Daniel Fuchs and Sonya Levien, based on a story by Fuchs.
The film stars Kim Novak in the title role. Jeff Chandler, Charles Drake, Agnes Moorehead, Larry Gates, Virginia Grey, Gene Lockhart and Murray Hamilton co-star.
Many aspects of Eagels' real life were omitted or largely fictionalized. Eagels' family later sued Columbia Pictures over the way Eagels was depicted in the film.
Plot.
Jeanne Eagels is a Kansas City waitress. After losing a carnival's beauty contest, she asks carny owner Sal Satori for a job. Her dancing in a skimpy costume is accused of being obscene. Sal decides to join his brother in New York and invites Jeanne to join them in an amusement park at Coney Island.
Taking acting lessons instead, the ambitious Jeanne becomes the understudy in a Broadway show and a star when she gets a chance to play the part. A once successful actress named Elsie Desmond wants to make a comeback in a new play, but Jeanne betrays her and takes the play for herself, willing to do anything to get ahead. Elsie denounces her in the theater before the first performance, then commits suicide. Sal is disgusted by Jeanne's behavior as well. She accepts a proposal from a ne'er-do-well named John Donahue, but both descend into alcoholism. Jeanne misses performances and causes fellow actors to lose out on paychecks.
Her situation deteriorates further when she's required to pay alimony to John after a divorce. A new play fails because Jeanne, drunk and on pills, collapses on stage. The actors' guild suspends her for 18 months. Unable to work, she returns to Sal's amusement park and is offered a job dancing. Another performer sexually assaults her in a dressing room. Jeanne, her life in ruins, continues to spiral downward and hallucinate. While trying to make it to a stage one night, she collapses on the staircase and dies.
DVD release.
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released "Jeanne Eagels" on August 3, 2010, as part of its "Kim Novak Collection." The box set also includes the films "Picnic" (1956); "Bell, Book and Candle" (1958); "Middle of the Night" (1959); and "Pal Joey" (1957).

Colin Skinner

Dr. Colin Skinner (born 1965) is a British author, adventurer and molecular biologist who is attempting to walk around the world. To date he has walked over and has crossed Great Britain, Iceland, America and New Zealand. He has used the walks to raise money and awareness for various causes, including conservation biology, people with disabilities, cancer relief, AIDS, and hospice.
Education.
Skinner earned his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) combined honours degree in biochemistry and genetics from the University of Leeds. He earned his PhD in molecular biology from University College London. He earned his Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in secondary science from Canterbury Christ Church University.
Walking around the world.
Walking Scotland to England in 1984.
He began at the age of 18 at John o' Groats (at the northern tip of Scotland) in 1984, and walked to Land's End in England. On this journey, which he carried out with three other people, he pushed a wheelchair and raised £3,500 for The Forelands School for handicapped children. In 1983, he had already run around a 400 metre track to raise further money for The Forelands School for handicapped children, at Broadstairs in Kent.
Walking across Iceland in 1986.
In 1986, at the age of 20, whilst at the University of Leeds, he crossed Iceland, together with three other people, from Seyðisfjörður in the east, through the interior to the north of the Vatnajökull ice fields, and then west to Reykjavík. The team encountered an 'ash storm', where storm force winds had whipped up fine black volcanic ash, and had to wear goggles and face masks to push on into the winds. In the rain shadow of the Vatnajökull, they ran out of water, then encountered a flash flood, as mud rushed down from the melting glaciers. They also had to survive on food contaminated with petrol that had leaked from their petrol stoves. This journey of raised £2,000 for the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation. As part of the training for the walk across Iceland he ran the Leeds Marathon, in a time of 3 hours and 41 minutes.
On the Icelandic trek, he came up with the idea of walking , across Britain and America to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support in Britain and hospice in America and Canada.
Walking Scotland to England in 1988.
On 1 May 1988, he set off again from John o' Groats, this time walking through the West Highlands, down the Pennine Way and then south to Land's End: a distance of in seven weeks. As part of the training for this walk he ran the gruelling Snowdonia Marathon, in a time of 4 hours and 40 minutes. The walk through Scotland and England raised £2,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.
Walking across the U.S.A. in 1988/1989.
The journey across the United States began on 15 July 1988. On the journey he slept in bushes beneath the World Trade Center, camped outside Kennedy Airport in a tent, then headed west. On Staten Island he collapsed from heat exhaustion at 105 degrees Fahrenheit. In Utah the temperatures went down to minus 30 Fahrenheit. Carrying a tent and a backpack, with no backup, he walked alone to Niagara Falls, through Ontario in Canada, to Detroit, between the Great Lakes, across the Great Plains, through the Rockies in winter, to Yellowstone National Park, then south to the Grand Canyon, on to Las Vegas, through Death Valley and then snowshoed over the Sierras to reach San Francisco. In Death Valley, down to his last $13, Skinner found $200 in the desert, and he had $1 left when he crossed the Sierras to reach Yosemite Valley. The total distance he walked from New York to San Francisco, was .
On the journey he visited 70 hospices and appeared on television, radio and in newspapers to encourage support for hospices across the U.S. and Canada. The mayor of San Francisco, Art Agnos, proclaimed 21 March 1989, "Colin Skinner Day," in recognition of the attention he brought to the work of hospices with AIDS patients in the city.
Returning to Britain after this walk, he obtained a job as a research assistant in Chemical Pathology at the Middlesex Hospital and went on to obtain a PhD in Molecular Biology at University College London. In 1992, whilst studying for his PhD, he also ran the London Marathon, in a time of 4 hours and 41 minutes, to raise money to buy a computer for a young boy with physical disabilities. Skinner's PhD involved developing genetic tests to detect congenital adrenal hyperplasia in children. He had work published in a number of scientific journals. In 1994 he had his work published in "Human Molecular Genetics". 
In 1994, Skinner married Dr. Monica Schneider (also a molecular biologist), and in 1996 their son James was born. From 1994 to 1996 Skinner worked as a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in Nashville, Tennessee. The work he carried out there involved gene sequencing and protein purification of cytochrome P450 enzymes. His work was published in the "Journal of Biological Chemistry". From 1996 to 1997 Skinner took care of his infant son, James, whilst his wife continued to work at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Walking across New Zealand in 1998.
In 1998 he walked from Cape Reinga in the North Island, to Bluff, at the southern tip of New Zealand. This was a distance of . On the journey he walked through the active volcano at White Island, experienced earthquakes up to 4.9 on the Richter Scale, clambered over glaciers, swam with seals and reported on conservation biology projects involving endangered species. Information from the journey was posted on the Internet for schoolchildren in the U.S. via the Scholastic Corporation Scholastic Network. In December 2010 Skinner completed a book about the New Zealand journey and conservation biology in New Zealand (New Zealand- 1500 miles on foot through - The Land Of The Long White Cloud). In January 2013 Skinner published New Zealand- 1500 miles on foot through - The Land Of The Long White Cloud on an Internet website. 
In 1999 he obtained a PGCE (Postgraduate Certificate in Education) from Canterbury Christ Church University in Canterbury, England. In 2000 he worked as a secondary school science teacher at St. Edmund's School in Dover, teaching 11 to 16 year olds.
In 2001 he worked as a volunteer at a wildlife park, working on enrichment activities for animals. From 2001 until 2003 he worked part-time at a post office. During this time, he also taught science to primary school children, in a 'Link-Scientist' scheme run by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, and took care of his son.
In 2003 his mother died from pancreatic cancer, at the age of 59. This prompted him to write the story of the journey across Britain and America. In 2006 he finished the book Beyond the Setting Sun. Ranulph Fiennes, the renowned polar explorer and adventurer wrote an introduction to the book.
The book has been written to raise money for hospices in Britain, Canada and America. In March 2013 Skinner published Beyond the Setting Sun on an Internet website. 
Walking Scotland to England in 2007.
On 29 April 2007, he began walking again at John o' Groats and arrived at Land's End on 8 June, having covered in 6 weeks. On the walk in Britain he visited 20 hospices and raised £10,000 for hospice through sales of the book Beyond the Setting Sun. As part of the training for this walk, Skinner ran the Great North Run half marathon, in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, in times from 2 hours, thirty minutes to 3 hours.
Walking across the U.S.A. in 2009.
Starting on 22 August 2009, he walked from Kennedy Airport in New York to within 15 miles of Devil's Lake, North Dakota. This was a distance of and Skinner stopped his journey on 3 December 2009, after 3 days with windchills down to -30 Fahrenheit. During the trip Skinner had to make incisions in his feet to relieve the pressure from blisters, suffered food poisoning, met up with a wolf in Upper Michigan, had to face down two wild dogs, and had ski masks frozen to his beard in North Dakota. On the journey he appeared on television, radio and in newspaper articles. He met hospice patients, including one woman with a terminal illness, who said that at times she could forget she was ill, thanks to the care she received in a hospice house in Buffalo, New York. He also met a man with lung cancer who could not sleep in hospitals, where there was always someone coming to check on him. In the hospice house in Windsor, Ontario, the man had a peaceful room to himself, where he could finally get some rest.
Walking across the U.S.A. in 2011.
On 10 September, 2011, Skinner set off from mile marker 283 on U.S. Route 2, before Devil's Lake, North Dakota and walked to Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park, California. The walk took him through North Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and into California. Skinner snow-shoed over Tioga Pass and camped in a tent in the Sierra Mountains for several nights, On the journey he appeared on television, radio and in newspapers and encouraged support for hospices taking care of people with serious illnesses.
In September of 2012, Skinner completed a short story, entitled Chenga, and published this on an Internet website. 
Skinner has now begun writing the third part of the science-fiction fantasy trilogy, entitled Tau. The Chenga, Djara, Tau trilogy includes the themes of time travel, parallel universes, vampires, shapeshifters, angels, demons and descendants of the fabled giants known as the Nephilim.

23 (Blonde Redhead album)

23 is the seventh studio album by Blonde Redhead. Released on , it debuted on the U.S. "Billboard" 200 at number 63, selling roughly 11,000 copies in its first week.
Background.
The album is the first the band self-produced, with additional assistance provided by Crowded House-producer Mitchell Froom on two tracks, "Silently" and "Top Ranking". In a press release accompanying the album, the band members acknowledged their goals to be more spontaneous in their song-writing, to aim for simplicity and clarity, and to create additional tensions. Drummer Simone Pace said he found it nerve wracking to enter the studio with only loose ideas for songs. Singer Kazu Makino admitted it "wasn't an entirely enjoyable experience. Without a producer, a referee, we could really get on each other's cases. It got intense."
The bandmates admitted that until they reached the mixing stage they were unsure what direction the album was taking.
Simone said it "sounds fresh because we are exploring new things. We get tired of doing the same thing all the time, so we search for other things to do."
The music video for single "Top Ranking" was directed by Mike Mills, and guests director/writer/actress/artist Miranda July as the main, and only, character. At the start of the video it says "One pose per second." Following that we view July for the duration striking a different pose every second, creating the effect of a living statue.
Artist Alex Gross created the album's cover art, "The Tragedy".

Clara Vale

Clara Vale is a hamlet situated on the south bank of the River Tyne in Tyne and Wear, England. Once an independent village in County Durham it became incorporated into the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear in 1974 and later became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.
Location.
Clara Vale stands on the south bank of the River Tyne in a low-lying and quite secluded spot. Crawcrook borders the hamlet to the south. To the north, across the river, is the village of Wylam in Northumberland. It is notable for being the first settlement in Tyne and Wear that the river Tyne reaches and passes after leaving Northumberland. 
Politics.
In local government, Clara Vale is located in the 'Crawcrook, Greenside and Clara Vale ward' of Gateshead Council. The ward is at the far west of Gateshead and borders part of Northumberland. The ward is served by three councillors (two Labour and one Liberal Democrat). Gateshead Council is Labour controlled. 
Clara Vale is located within the parliamentary constituency of Blaydon. Its current MP is Labour's Dave Anderson.
History.
Clara Vale came into existence as a purpose built colliery community in the late nineteenth century. Built by the Stella Coal Company, it thrived next to the nearby pit of Clara. However, by the 1960s, the mine closed down. So too had many other nearby pits such as Emma, Greenside and Stargate. 
Modern-day Clara Vale.
After the collapse of the coal industry in the 1960s Clara Vale has managed to survive and is still a vibrant community. In the present day it has rather affluent residents and employment tends to be in managerial and professional roles who are attracted to the area for its quiet and rural character. Farming is also an important sector in the area. 
Clara Vale remains a remarkable community and is still only a very small village, barely larger than a hamlet. This is largely due to a great lack of recent development in the area. There is very little in the way of modern housing, only the one terraced street, built in the traditional style of the village. Of the other non-pit housing and buildings, there is only the chapel and former school (now a community centre). There are no local shops. 
By avoiding the suburbanisation experienced by nearby towns and villages such as Crawcrook, Greenside and Ryton. Clara Vale has retained its rural character completely. Farms and countryside surrounds the village. This includes a local nature reserve which stands at the site of the old colliery. 
Due to its small size, Clara Vale has limited amenities and local services. However, nearby Crawcrook and Ryton offer a range of shops and services and both of these are within walking distance of the village so whilst Clara Vale remains secluded, it is by no means isolated. Clara Vale does, however, have three nearby golf courses. Ryton golf course, in Clara Vale itself; Tyneside golf club in Ryton and, over the river to the north, Close House golf club in Wylam. 
The village also has a recreation ground, originally provided by the pit owners for the miners' welfare. The recreation ground has a football pitch and a cricket pitch with pavilion. Clara Vale Cricket Club play matches at the recreation ground on Saturdays during the Summer, with Ovingham Bridge End Cricket Club playing on some Sundays and Merz and McLellan Cricket Club on some Wednesday evenings. Clara Vale FC junior teams also play on the pitch at the Recreation Ground. Clara Vale Local Nature Reserve is located next to the recreation ground.

The Fox in the Chicken Coop

Based on Ephraim Kishon’s satirical book by the same name, The Fox in the Chicken Coop (Hebrew: "Ha Shu'al B'Lool Hatarnegolot") is a 1978 Israeli film directed by Kishon. It features many prominent Israeli actors of the time, most notably Shaike Ophir and Seffy Rivlin. The film takes a satirical, comic look at the old generation of Israeli politicians.
Plot.
Amitz Dolniker, an aging Israeli Parliament member known for his high-winded babbling and tireless lecturing, is told he needs to take a break from politics after he collapses during a speech. Fainting, he starts out on a dream trip to spend some weeks in a far-away, backward Israeli village that has little contact with civilization. The farmers’ bucolic and carefree life repels him at first (and especially the fact that they have never heard of him), but then he decides to introduce some “order” to the innocent society. As none of the villagers agree to become the village head (they don’t want the trouble), Dolniker hires a local horse and buggy and puts it at the service of the village barber, declaring him village head “de facto”. The barber objects at first, but as he becomes used to the perks that come along with the position, his grip on power tightens. This leads to a rivalry with other villagers (especially the cobbler) who think themselves equally worthy of becoming the village head (with free horse-and-buggy, of course), which is what Dolniker has expected. He suggests an election to determine the leader. The result, however, bears no resemblance to the orderly political process he is used to, and Dolniker finds himself entangled in silly power struggles, taxes imposed on 3-door closets, corruption, petty bureaucracy, and a ruination of the simple way of life the village once knew. Dolniker comes back to his senses, mildly laughing about himself.

<doc id="9731653" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9731653" title="Mitrokhin Commission">
Mitrokhin Commission

The Mitrokhin Commission was an Italian parliamentary commission set up in 2002 to investigate alleged KGB ties of some Italian politicians.
Set up by the Italian Parliament, then led by Silvio Berlusconi's center-right coalition, the "Casa delle Libertà", and presided by Senator Paolo Guzzanti ("Forza Italia"), its focus was on alleged KGB ties to opposition figures in Italian politics, basing itself on the controversial Mitrokhin Archive, and various other sources including the consultant Mario Scaramella. The Mitrokhin Commission alleged, among other things, that Romano Prodi, former center-left Prime Minister of Italy and President of the European Commission from 1999 to 2004, was the "KGB's man in Italy." 
The commission was disbanded in March 2006, without any concrete evidence given to support the original allegations of KGB ties to Italian politicians. In five years, the Commission had heard 47 witnesses, for a total cost of 1.9 million euros. Mario Scaramella was arrested in late December 2006 and charged with libel and illegal weapons' trade, with wiretaps of phone calls between Mr. Scaramella and Senator Guzzanti published by the Italian press in late 2006, showing that the two planned to discredit various political opposition figures by claiming ties with the KGB. 
The April 2006 general election was won by Romano Prodi's center-left "L'Unione", and in November 2006 the new Italian parliament instituted a commission to investigate the Mitrokhin Commission for allegations that it was manipulated for political purposes.
Members of the commission.
The inter-parliamentary commission was composed by the following twenty Senators and twenty Representatives: The President Sen. Paolo Guzzanti; the Vicepresidents Andrea Papini and Giovanni Mongiello; the secretaries Giampaolo Zancan and Salvatore Meleleo; the Senators Giulio Andreotti, Guglielmo Castagnetti, Mario Cavallaro, Amedeo Ciccanti, Cinzia Dato, Luciano Falcier, Costantino Garraffa, Mario Gasbarri, Lauro Salvatore, Loris Giuseppe Maconi, Lucio Malan, Luigi Marino, Franco Mugnai, Gianni Nieddu, Lodovico Pace, Piergiorgio Stiffoni, Roberto Ulivi, Lodovico Pace, Piergiorgio Stiffoni, Roberto Ulivi; the deputies Ferdinando Adornato, Gabriele Albonetti, Maurizio Bertucci, Valter Bielli, Francesco Carboni, Fabrizio Cicchitto, Giuseppe Cossiga, Oliviero Diliberto, Lino Duilio, Giuseppe Fallica, Vincenzo Fragalà, Pierfrancesco Emilio Romano Gamba, Francesco Giordano, Giuseppe Lezza, Giuseppe Molinari, Erminio Angelo Quartiani, Enzo Raisi, Giacomo Stucchi.
Allegations.
Allegations of KGB ties, which were denied and ruled defamatory in nature in court, included former (and current) Premier Romano Prodi, named as the "KGB's man in Italy", his staff, Hon. Massimo D'Alema, Hon. Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the CESIS), Milan's judges Armando Spataro, and Guido Salvini, both in charge of the "Imam Rapito" case, as well as "La Repubblica" reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who broke the Yellowcake forgery scandal. Also known as the "Niger uranium forgeries", this latter affair refers to falsified classified documents provided by the Italian SISMI to US intelligence. These forgeries depicted an attempt by the regime of Iraq's Saddam Hussein to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger during the Iraq armament crisis, and was one of the reasons cited by the Bush administration to invade Iraq in 2003.
The "Bulgarian connection" claim.
Senator Guzzanti also revived the old "Bulgarian connection" thesis concerning Mehmet Ali Agca's 1981 attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. He claimed in the draft of the report, without providing evidence to back his claim, that "leaders of the former Soviet Union were behind the assassination attempt", alleging that "the leadership of the Soviet Union took the initiative to eliminate Pope John Paul" because of his support for Solidarity, the Polish trade-union, relaying "this decision to the military secret services" (and not the KGB). According to Frank Brodhead, however, the new conclusions brought by Paolo Guzzanti were based on the same "information" provided in the early 1980s by Mr. Michael Ledeen, a U.S. neo-conservative author tied to the SISMI and Mehmet Ali Agca himself, which is "bogus at best and at worst deliberately misleading." The "Bulgarian connection" thesis was debunked by Francesco Pazienza, a member of Propaganda Due, cited in a 1987 article in "The Nation" as well as by media analyst Edward S. Herman in "1986: The Rise and Fall of the Bulgarian Connection". Pazienza claimed that Michael Ledeen "was the person responsible for dreaming up the 'Bulgarian connection' behind the plot to kill the Pope." Ledeen recognized to the "Vanity Fair" having been paid $10,000 by the SISMI in 1979 or 1980, allegedly on extradition matters with the US. "Washington Post" reporter Michael Dobbs, who had initially believed this conspiracy theory, later wrote that "the Bulgarian connection was invented by Agca with the hope of winning his release from prison. … He was aided and abetted in this scheme by right-wing conspiracy theorists in the United States and William Casey's Central Intelligence Agency, which became a victim of its own disinformation campaign."
Senator Guzzanti said that the commission had decided to re-open the report's chapter on the assassination attempt in 2005, after the Pope wrote about it in his last book, "Memory and Identity: Conversations Between Millenniums". The Pope wrote that he was convinced the shooting was not Ağca's initiative and that "someone else masterminded it and someone else commissioned it" .
Guzzanti's claims in the draft report were based on recent computer analysis of photographs that purported to demonstrate Antonov's presence in St Peter's Square during the shooting and on information brought by the French anti-terrorist judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, a controversial figure whose last feat was to indict Rwandese president Paul Kagame, claiming he had deliberately provoked the 1994 Rwandan Genocide against his own ethnic group in order to take the power. According to "Le Figaro", Bruguière, who is in close contacts as well with Moscow as with Washington, D.C., including the CIA and the FBI, has been accused by many of his colleagues of "privileging the raison d'état over law."
Both Russia and Bulgaria condemned the report. "For Bulgaria, this case closed with the court decision in Rome in March 1986", Foreign Ministry spokesman Dimitar Tsanchev said, while also recalling the Pope's comments during his May 2002 visit to Bulgaria.
This "Bulgarian connection" thesis, which claims that the Soviet Union was in fact behind the Pope's assassination attempt by the former Grey Wolves member, Mehmet Ali Agca, had been denounced previously by Pope John Paul II during his travel to Bulgaria in May 2002. In Russia, Foreign Intelligence Service spokesman Boris Labusov called the accusation "absurd.".
Analysis of the allegations.
In an interview published in "La Repubblica" in November 2006, former KGB agent Yevgeny Limarev told how the "working group" of the commission purpose was to find connections between Italian political left exponents and KGB or FSB, presumably for political purpose. Asked about targeted personae he said: "Without a doubt, the first name on the list was that of Prodi, especially during the period preceding the spring elections. [...] Prodi was a real obsession, in spite of the fact that nothing ever came out on your Prime Minister." In a rebuke to the original Mitrokhin commission's authenticity, Vasily Mitrokhin himself refused to meet the Commission's members before his death.
On December 1, 2006 several Italian newspapers published interceptions of telephone calls between Paolo Guzzanti and Mario Scaramella, a consultant on the Mitrokhin Commission, who became involved in the events surrounding the death of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in Great Britain on 23 November 2006 
In the interceptions, Guzzanti declared that the Mitrokhin Commission's unstated goal was to depict Romano Prodi and Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, leader of the Federation of the Greens and current Minister of Environment in Prodi's government, as "agents of the KGB", financed by Moscow in order to discredit him. In these interceptions, the two men also discussed plans to claim that Antonio Bassolino, governor of the Campania region, was linked to the Camorra. According to the "Corriere della Sera", these interceptions demonstrated that Scaramella was in contact with Italian police agents, penitentiary police agents, and two CIA agents, one of them being Robert Seldon Lady, former CIA station chief in Milan, indicted by prosecutor Armando Spataro for having coordinated the abduction of Abu Omar in 2003 in Milan, a case of extraordinary rendition which gave rise to the "Imam Rapito affair".
Scaramella, according to the interceptions, was to collect false witnesses among KGB refugees in Europe to support this aim. 
He was arrested end of December 2006 on charges of calumny and illegal weapons' trade. The investigation showed that Scaramella received some of his "information" from Alexander Litvinenko. Scaramella was then an obscure figure, described as follows by the "International Herald Tribune":
a slew of media reports about him and his career here — which included trying to prove that some top Italian center-left politicians, including Prime Minister Romano Prodi, are Russian spies — have invariably included unflattering adjectives. They include: "incurable liar", "wannabe 007", "braggart", "bumbler" and "swindler" — not to mention "fool" and "mental case.
His repeated offers to collaborate with the Italian secret services were all rejected in the 1990s by the Italian government. Nonetheless, from 2003 to 2006, he worked for the Mitrokhin Commission. When a left-wing member of the Commission questioned his creditals, he promptly remade one.
According to the investigations of Rome prosecutor Pietro Salvitti, who indicted Mario Scaramella, cited by "La Repubblica", Nicolò Pollari, head of SISMI indicted in the "Imam Rapito" affair, as well as SISMI n°2, Marco Mancini, arrested in July 2006 for the same reason, were some of the informers, alongside Mario Scaramella, of senator Paolo Guzzanti. Beside targeting Romano Prodi and his staff, this "network", according to Pietro Salvitti's words, also aimed at defaming General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the CESIS), Milan's judges Armando Spataro, in charge of the "Imam Rapito" case and Guido Salvini, as well as "La Repubblica" reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who broke the Yellowcake forgery scandal as well as the SISMI-Telecom affair, in which Marco Mancini, n°2 of the SISMI already indicted in the "Imam Rapito" affair, was arrested for end of 2006. The investigation also showed a connection between Scaramella and the CIA, in particular through Filippo Marino, one of Scaramella's closest partners since the 1990s and co-founder of the Environmental Crime Prevention Program (ECPP), described as an empty shell according to the "International Herald Tribune". Marino, now living in the U.S., has acknowledged in an interview an association with former and active CIA officers, including Robert Lady, former CIA station chief in Milan above-mentioned.
Closure of the Commission and creation of a new commission.
The Mitrokhin Commission was shut down in March 2006 without any concrete result provided, and not one political figure was exposed by the allegations, despite months of press speculation alimented by Berlusconi family newspaper "Il Giornale". Following the general election and the nomination of Romano Prodi as head of the new government, a parliamentary commission was instituted to investigate about this controversial "Mitrokhin Commission".

Arbetsgemenskapen Kyrklig Förnyelse

Arbetsgemenskapen Kyrklig Förnyelse (aKF), the "The Church Union" in Church of Sweden, is the umbrella organisation for the Lutheran High Church movement in the Church of Sweden.
The organisation's beginnings were originally inspired by the book "Kyrklig förnyelse" by Father Gunnar Rosendal and it already existed a long time before its official foundation on 28 April 1959. The annual assembly of aKF is in Uppsala in August. Theologically the aKF is orthodox and in opposition to Folk Church ideology and the general theological liberalism in the Church of Sweden. One well known member of this organisation was a Swedish-Canadian scholar Eric Segelberg.
The aKF's sister organisations are the Church Union in the Church of England, Bønne- og arbeidsfellesskapet Kirkelig Fornyelse in Norway,

Inuktun language

Inuktun (, , ) is the language of approximately 1,000 indigenous Inughuit, inhabiting the world's northernmost settlements in Qaanaaq and the surrounding villages in northwestern Greenland.
All speakers of Inuktun also speak Standard West Greenlandic and many also speak Danish and a few also English. Apart from the town of Qaanaaq, Inuktun is also spoken in the villages of Muriuhaq, Hiurapaluk, Qikiqtat, Qikiqtarhuaq, Havighivik (names given in Inuktun). 
The language was first described by the explorers Knud Rasmussen and Peter Freuchen who travelled through northern Greenland in the early twentieth century and established a trading post at Dundas in 1910. Inuktun does not have its own orthography and is not taught in schools. However, most of the inhabitants of Qaanaaq and the surrounding villages use Inuktun in their everyday communication.
The language is an Eskimo–Aleut language and dialectologically it is in between the Greenlandic Kalaallisut and the Canadian Inuktitut. The Polar Inuit were the last to cross from Canada into Greenland and they may have arrived as late as in the eighteenth century. The language differs from Kalaallisut by substituting Kalaallisut /s/ with an h-sound often pronounced like a palatal fricative as in German "ich". Inuktun also allows more consonant combinations than Kalaallisut and has some minor grammatical and lexical differences.

Laurie Fisher born in Canberra and is currently Gloucester Rugby's head coach.
He began his coaching career with the Brumbies in 2000 when he was appointed Head Coach of the Brumbies Rugby Academy and later assumed control of the Brumby Runners and the Canberra Vikings. He implemented a rugby program aimed at developing the cream of local ACT rugby talent into players capable of competing for training contracts or full contracts with the Brumbies squad. Guy Shepherdson, Matt Giteau and Julian Salvi all made successful transitions to the professional game under his guidance.
In 2003, Laurie was promoted to the Brumbies forwards coach under David Nucifora and contributed to their success as 2004 Super 12 Champions.
Fisher's contribution and devotion to the Brumbies as an assistant coach saw them earn success from 2000 as semi finalists, two time finalists and two time champions. As a head coach, Laurie failed to guide the Brumbies to any finals appearances. Midway through the 2008 season the Brumbies announced they would not be renewing his contract as head coach. Laurie was named forwards coach for Munster Rugby on 8 July 2008, with his experience in the Experimental Law Variations (ELV's) cited as a key reason for his appointment

<doc id="9731719" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9731719" title="Microsoft Silverlight">
Microsoft Silverlight

Microsoft Silverlight is an application framework for writing and running rich Internet applications, with features and purposes similar to those of Adobe Flash. The run-time environment for Silverlight is available as a plug-in for web browsers running under Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. While early versions of Silverlight focused on streaming media, current versions support multimedia, graphics, and animation, and give developers support for CLI languages and development tools. Silverlight is also one of the two application development platforms for Windows Phone, but web pages which use Silverlight cannot run on the Windows Phone or Windows Mobile versions of Internet Explorer, as there is no Silverlight plugin for Internet Explorer on those platforms.
Over the course of about five years Microsoft released five versions: The first version was released in 2007; the fifth on May 8, 2012. It is compatible with later versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome web browsers on Microsoft Windows (except Windows RT) operating systems, with Firefox and Safari under Mac and OS X, and with mobile devices using the Windows Mobile and Symbian (Series 60) platforms.
A free software implementation named Moonlight, developed by Novell in cooperation with Microsoft, was released to bring Silverlight versions 1 and 2 functionality to Linux, FreeBSD and other open source platforms—although some Linux distributions do not include it, citing redistribution and patent concerns. However, in May 2012, Moonlight was abandoned because of its lack of popularity.
Silverlight has been used to provide video streaming for many high profile events, including the NBC coverage of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, and the 2008 conventions for both major United States political parties. Silverlight is also used by Netflix for its instant video streaming service. Netflix has stated in its Tech Blog that their goal is to move their video streaming service from Silverlight to HTML5 in the future.
Overview.
Silverlight provides a retained mode graphics system similar to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), and integrates multimedia, graphics, animations and interactivity into a single run-time environment. In Silverlight applications, user interfaces are declared in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) and programmed using a subset of the .NET Framework. XAML can be used for marking up the vector graphics and animations. Silverlight can also be used to create Windows Sidebar gadgets for Windows Vista.
Silverlight supports H.264 video, Advanced Audio Coding, Windows Media Video (WMV), Windows Media Audio (WMA) and MPEG Layer III (MP3) media content across all supported browsers without requiring Windows Media Player, the Windows Media Player ActiveX control or Windows Media browser plug-ins. Because Windows Media Video 9 is an implementation of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) VC-1 standard, Silverlight also supports VC-1 video. According to the end user license agreement VC-1 and H.264 are only licensed for the "personal and non-commercial use of a consumer". Silverlight, since version 3, supports the playback of H.264 video. Silverlight makes it possible to dynamically load Extensible Markup Language (XML) content that can be manipulated through a Document Object Model (DOM) interface, a technique that is consistent with conventional Ajax techniques. Silverlight exposes a "Downloader" object which can be used to download content, like scripts, media assets or other data, as may be required by the application. With version 2, the programming logic can be written in any .NET language, including some derivatives of common dynamic programming languages like IronRuby and IronPython.
Adoption.
According to statowl.com, Microsoft Silverlight had a penetration of 64.16% on May 2011. Usage on July 2010 was 53.54%, whereas Adobe Flash was installed on 95.26% of browsers, and Java support was available on 76.51% of browsers, making Adobe Flash the market leader in terms of penetration. Support of these plugins is not mutually exclusive; one system can support all three.
Not all Web sites require a browser plugin; of those that do, , fewer than 0.3% sites used Silverlight and Java, 27% used Adobe Flash, although another source cites around 4% for Java.
Supported platforms.
Desktop computers.
Silverlight requires an x86 processor with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) support. Supported processors include the Intel Pentium III and up, and the AMD Athlon XP and up. Newer AMD Duron models are also supported.
The following table presents an availability and compatibility matrix of Silverlight versions for various operating systems and web browsers.
An upcoming Opera support was promised since May 3, 2007, when David Storey, the Chief Web Opener at Opera, revealed a Microsoft poster for MIX conference that had shown Opera integration as a part of Silverlight 1.1. , however, Silverlight still does not officially support Opera. Silverlight 1.0 could be made to work with Opera via a hack. Starting from Silverlight 2, hacks were no longer required.
On Linux and FreeBSD, the functionality is available via Moonlight. Moonlight is available for the major Linux distributions, with support for Firefox, Konqueror, and Opera browsers, provided it was obtained through Novell. Miguel de Icaza has expressed an interest in working with developers from other operating systems (BSD, Solaris) and other browsers (Konqueror, WebKit and Opera) to ensure that Moonlight works fine on their systems. Availability of Moonlight version 1.0 for FreeBSD was announced in March 2009, but has since been reported not to actually work.
Mobile devices.
Silverlight is not available on Android or iOS, operating systems that are prevalent on the mobile market (as of 2013).
Silverlight is the primary development environment for Windows Phone and is based on Silverlight 4. For previous versions of Windows Mobile, the first Community Technology Preview (CTP) for Windows Mobile 6 was expected in the second quarter of 2008, but it still has not been officially announced. Microsoft has stopped focusing on bringing Silverlight to Windows Mobile 6.x. Nokia has announced plans to make Silverlight for Mobile available for S60 on Symbian OS, as well as for Series 40 devices and Nokia internet tablets. Silverlight for Mobile supports Silverlight 2 content and .NET languages. Silverlight for Windows Phone 7.5 is based on Silverlight 4.
Development tools.
Silverlight applications can be written in any .NET programming language. As such, any development tools which can be used with .NET languages can work with Silverlight, provided they can target the Silverlight CoreCLR for hosting the application, instead of the .NET Framework CLR. Microsoft has positioned Microsoft Expression Blend as a companion tool to Visual Studio for the design of Silverlight User Interface applications. Visual Studio can be used to develop and debug Silverlight applications. To create Silverlight projects and let the compiler target CoreCLR, Visual Studio requires the "Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio".
A Silverlight control is a ZIP bnj format file with extension .XAP containing a list of one or more .NET managed assemblies (.DLL files) along with the AppManifest.XAML file containing this list along with the entry point (class and assembly). It can be hosted in any HTML file using an object tag, for example: 
A Silverlight project contains the Silverlight.js and CreateSilverlight.js files which initializes the Silverlight plug-in for use in HTML pages, a XAML file for the UI, and code-behind files for the application code. Silverlight applications are debugged in a manner similar to ASP.NET applications. Visual Studio's "CLR Remote Cross Platform Debugging" feature can be used to debug Silverlight applications running on a different platform as well.
In conjunction with the release of Silverlight 2, Eclipse was added as a development tool option.
Licensing.
An April 2007 to 2008 "PC World" report suggested that Microsoft intended to release certain parts of Silverlight source code as open source software, but a week later Sam Ramji, director of platform technology strategy at Microsoft, contradicted the rumors by confirming that the company had no plans to open Silverlight. Some controls that ship with Silverlight are available under the Microsoft Public License as a part of a separate project known as the "Silverlight Toolkit".
Silverlight's proprietary nature is a concern to competition since it may harm the open nature of the World Wide Web. Advocates of free software are also concerned Silverlight could be another example of Microsoft's embrace, extend and extinguish strategy. Both Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe Flash are proprietary. Flash's file formats are publicly documented standards, as are Silverlight's. However, the communication between a Flash player and a server is done by the proprietary protocol RTMP. Both Flash and Silverlight use patent-encumbered audio and video codecs.
Mono Moonlight implementation.
The Mono Team abandoned development of Moonlight, a free and open-source implementation of both the Silverlight 1 and 2 runtimes.
The development has been discontinued as of 2012 due to the poor acceptance of Silverlight and restrictions Microsoft imposed on its utility.
The project was officially supported by Microsoft who, under an agreement with Novell, has made additional specifications, access to the Silverlight Base Class Library APIs, binary codecs and test cases available to the Mono team, none of which are available to other members of the public.
The "covenant" under which Novell has been granted this exclusive access also specifies conditions that are incompatible with the licensing that covers most free and open source software. As examples, it specifically requires that the software must have been "obtained directly from Novell or through an Intermediate Recipient" and that it must be "not licensed under GPLv3 or a Similar License". Some free software proponents have criticized the covenant.
Silverlight has received criticism for not living up to its cross-platform operating system compatibility promises, especially on Linux systems compared to its extensive support on Apple and Microsoft desktops for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. Even though Microsoft was officially collaborating on the Moonlight project, Bruce Chizen, who was CEO of Adobe Systems at the time, which sells the competing proprietary Flash platform, questioned "the commitment of Microsoft to keep the Silverlight platform compatible with other OS besides Windows". His concerns are based on "examples from history" where, he argues, Microsoft has launched products with promises of ongoing cross-platform compatibility that no longer apply, for example Internet Explorer for UNIX and Windows Media Player for Mac.
Relationship to existing web standards.
California and several other U.S. states also have asked a district judge to extend most of Microsoft's antitrust case settlement for another five years, citing "a number of concerns, including the fear that Microsoft could use the next version of Windows to 'tilt the playing field' toward Silverlight, its new Adobe Flash competitor," says a "Seattle Post-Intelligencer" article. The final judgment on the motion extended the settlement two years, to November 2009, but for reasons unrelated to Silverlight. In Windows 7 the Silverlight web browser plug-in is not installed automatically, but is a downloadable optional update through Windows Update.
Microsoft has been criticized for not using the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) standard for Silverlight, which, according to Ryan Paul, editor of Open Ended, Ars Technica's open source software journal, is consistent with Microsoft's way of ignoring open standards in other products, as well. However, according to David Betz, a .NET specialist and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP), Microsoft would have had to alter the SVG specification in order to integrate it with .NET, so that "by choosing to use XAML over SVG, Microsoft kept SVG pure by not add proprietary technology to it."

Minot Air Force Station

Minot (Also known as Velva) Air Force Station (ADC ID: P-28 NORAD ID: Z-28) Installation Number (PIN): 1445; Installation Location Code (ILC): QJVM) is a closed United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. It is located south of Minot, North Dakota; on the west side of US Highway 83. It was closed in 1979. A portion of the property was reopened in 1984 as the Minot Communications Site and served until 1997.
Minot Air Force Station was the first major Air Force installation in North Dakota, even predating the two "large" bases, Minot Air Force Base and Grand Forks Air Force Base.
History.
Minot Air Force Station was part of the last batch of twenty-three radar stations constructed as part of the Air Defense Command permanent network. It was activated on 20 May 1951 at Velva, ND, and declared completely operational in 1952.
The 786th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operations with AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-5 radars in April 1952, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. 
It was named Minot Air Force Station on 1 December 1953. During 1957 an AN/GPS-3 search radar saw brief use. In 1958 the original radars were replaced by AN/FPS-20 search and AN/FPS-6 height-finder sets. A second height-finder set, AN/FPS-6B, was installed during the following year. 
During 1961 Minot AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-20 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 786th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile.
By the end of 1961 the search set had been upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-28.
An AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar was installed in 1964, and the AN/FPS-6 was retired. The AN/FPS-6B was upgraded to an AN/FPS-90 also that year. In 1964 the site received an AN/FPS-27 search radar which became fully operational in early 1965. The AN/FPS-66 was removed later in 1965. In 1968 the AN/FPS-90 was retired. 
In addition to the main facility, Minot operated three unmanned AN/FPS-14 (P-28A) and AN/FPS-18 (P-28B/C) Gap Filler sites:
The Alexander site was reassigned to Minot after Dickinson AFS (Z-177) closed in 1965. The site is now home to the Watford City Joint Surveillance System (JSS) (ARSR-4) LRR site (Z-300/J-76).
Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In early 1979 the Air Force announced that the station would be closing due to what was called "redundancies with more strategically located radars". On 29 September 1979 the 786th Radar Squadron was inactivated and the station was closed.
In 1984, a portion of the station was reopened by the USAF as the Minot Communication Site. It was closed again in 1997 and struck from the USAF property register and liquidated "ca". 1998. Minot AFS has been sold to civilian interests, and has been reused as a housing subdivision colloquially known as the "Radar Base". The station after standing derelict for decades has now been torn down.

Buildings on the station include:
Air Force units and assignments.

Zastava M-70

The Zastava M-70 is an assault rifle developed and produced in Yugoslavia, nowadays Kragujevac, Serbia by Zastava Arms company. The design of the M-70 was based on modified Soviet AK-47 and AKM assault rifles and it became the standard issue weapon in the Yugoslav People's Army in 1970. The M-70 is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective fire rifle.
History.
Initial development of a domestic AK variant began c.a 1959, and the first models submitted by Zastava for military field trials were with the early M-64 series of rifles with milled receivers, threaded barrels, familiar Zastava handguards, gas cutoffs for grenade launching, and several other diversities from the mainstay AK design, such as a bolt hold open device on the right side of the receiver, and a charging handle that appeared different from other AK models. Though performances were satisfactory, the Yugoslav military did not adopt the rifle as the standard infantry armament.
In 1970, a second opportunity emerged, and Zastava was given the go ahead to begin with army funded mass production of the AP M-70 and M-70A series (, Automatic Rifle Model 1970) of which the M-70A was the folding stock version.
Before the larger models of these rifles were made, cost-cutting measures in production resulted in the removal of the internal bolt hold open, and relocation to the magazine follower. In addition, the usual placement of the barrel through threading into the receiver was replaced by the cheaper method of pressing and pinning the barrel into the receiver. Rifles produced with these new features were known as models AP M-70B (fixed stock version), and M-70AB (folding stock version).
As with the M-70 series of automatic rifles, these models failed to be produced in larger quantities before further cost-efficiency production measures gave way to yet another model. 
This time the milled receiver was replaced by a receiver stamped from a smooth thick sheet of steel, a firing rate reducer was added to the trigger group, and the muzzle brake replaced the muzzle nut that originally came on the two prior models. Yugoslavian AKs produced with these features were named models AP M-70B1 (fixed stock) and M-70AB1 (folding stock).
These models eventually failed to mass-produce as well, before final alterations to the M-70 rifle design resulted with the AP M-70B2 (fixed stock) and M-70AB2 (folding stock) models. These last two models featured a thicker stamped receiver and bulged front trunnion, which was intended to strengthen the rifle in order to make it more suitable for frequent grenade launching. These two models would become the most widely produced of the M-70 series, and in turn the most widely used model used by the YPA, as well as the various armed groups fighting in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. Parts kits imported into the U.S. however, show markings that appear to contradict the final fixed stock model name. On these kits the bulged, thicker stamped receiver model is actually the M-70B1 model.
All of the M-70 models share the grenade launching ability with gas cutoff, the lengthened wooden handguard with 3 cooling slots, iron sights with flip-up illuminating elements, initially filled with phosphorus and later with tritium (Which is used on the current production M-70's), to improve aiming at night; the plunger that keeps the receiver cover in place during grenade launching, and a non-chrome lined barrel. Fire selectors have R markings for automatic fire (The R stands for "rafalna", "burst fire") and J for semi-automatic fire (The J stands for "jedinačna", "single").
Design and features.
The M-70 can easily be told apart from other AK rifles by the three cooling slots on the foregrip, the light-coloured teak furniture and the black rubber buttplate on fixed-stock M-70s. The M-70s also have a grenade-launching sight and gas cut-off on the gas block, and are capable of launching rifle-grenades. To launch them a 22mm diameter grenade launching adapter is screwed on in place of the slant brake or other muzzle device.
The receiver of the M-70 is 1.5 mm thick, compared to the 1 mm thick receiver of the AKM, making it more rigid. Likewise, the barrel is not chrome-lined, making it more accurate than a standard AKM, but at the cost of increased susceptibility to corrosion. The lack of chrome lining is consistent with other Zastava built rifles of Soviet design (such as the Yugoslavian M-59 or M-59/66).

Variant type

Variant is a data type in certain programming languages, particularly Visual Basic, OCaml, and C++ when using the Component Object Model.
In Visual Basic (and Visual Basic for Applications) the Variant data type is a tagged union that can be used to represent any other data type (for example, integer, floating-point, single- and double-precision, object, etc.) except fixed-length string type and record types. In Visual Basic any variable, not declared explicitly or the type of which is not declared explicitly, is taken to be a variant.
While the use of not explicitly declared variants is not recommended, they can be of use when the needed data type can only be known at runtime, when the data type is expected to vary, or when optional parameters and parameter arrays are desired. In fact, languages with a dynamic type system often have variant as the "only" available type for variables.
Among the major changes in Visual Basic .NET, being a .NET language, the variant type was replaced with the .NET "object" type. There are similarities in concept, but also major differences, and no direct conversions exist between these two types. For conversions, as might be needed if Visual Basic .NET code is interacting with a Visual Basic 6 COM object, the normal methodology is to use .NET marshalling.
In unrelated usage, "variant type" is also used to refer to an algebraic data type (comparable to a tagged union), whose constructors are often called "variants". In languages such as OCaml and Haskell, this kind of variant type is the standard language building block for representing many data structures.
Examples.
In Visual Basic, a variant named A can be explicitly declared as shown in either of these two examples:
In Delphi, a variant named A is declared in the following way:
<syntaxhighlight lang='delphi'>
var A: variant;
</syntaxhighlight>
Format.
A variable of variant type, for brevity called a "variant", as defined in Visual Basic, needs 16 bytes storage and its layout is as follows:
Types.
A few examples of variants that one can encounter in Visual Basic follow. In other languages other kinds of variants can be used as well.
Common uses.
Collections.
The codice_1 class in OLE Automation can store items of different data types. Since the data type of these items cannot be known at compile time, the methods to add items to and retrieve items from a collection use variants. If in Visual Basic the codice_2 construct is used, the iterator variable must be of object type, or a variant.
Dispatch method calls.
In OLE Automation the codice_3 interface is used when the class of an object cannot be known in advance. Hence when calling a method on such an object the types of the arguments and the return value is not known compile time. The arguments are passed as an array of variants and when the call completes a variant is returned.
Optional parameters.
In Visual Basic a procedure argument can be declared to be optional by prefixing it with the codice_4 keyword. When the argument is omitted Visual Basic passes a special value to the procedure, called "Missing" in the table above, indicating that the argument is missing. Since the value could either be a supplied value or a special value, a variant must be used.
Similarly the keyword codice_5 can be used to pass all following arguments in a variant array.

Alejandra Gutierrez Oraa

Alejandra Gutiérrez Oraa is a Venezuelan television anchor currently working for CNN en Español in Atlanta, Georgia.
A native from La Guaira, Venezuela, Alejandra moved to the United States as a teenager due to a catastrophic event in her hometown known as the Vargas tragedy. In 1999, the geographic center of Vargas state suffered devastating floods and landslides, which resulted in a major loss of life and property, forced population movements, and the virtual disappearance of several small towns in Vargas state.
Alejandra is one of the news anchors for CNN en Español’s morning show "Café CNN", a four-hour program that airs weekdays between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. (ET) designed to blend hard news with human interest and lifestyle improvement information to help viewers "stay ahead in today’s competitive world."
At 23 years of age, Oraa became the youngest news anchor for CNN en Español and its affiliates. She started her television career at 18 as an Entertainment Reporter for TV Azteca in Miami. She also gained experience working with Fox Sports en Español, covering special events such as Super Bowl XLI.
In 2008, Oraa was chosen for a new style of "Reality Morning Show" at one of Miami's most popular Hispanic radio stations, Romance 106.7 FM. There she hosted "Hola Miami", a reality morning show featuring three women born in different decades. The show was later renamed "Paparazzi Radio Sensacional". While working in radio, Oraa became known as “the voice” of numerous international campaigns for HBO's Sex and the City, Olive Garden, Ford, and Marshalls, among others. In 2010, she joined the news team of Mega TV to become part of the journalistic team of "Mega News", a national newscast that covered the breaking stories of the day.

Probability matching

Probability matching is a suboptimal decision strategy in which predictions of class membership are proportional to the class base rates. Thus, if in the training set positive examples are observed 60% of the time, and negative examples are observed 40% of the time, then the observer using a "probability-matching" strategy will predict (for unlabeled examples) a class label of "positive" on 60% of instances, and a class label of "negative" on 40% of instances. 
The optimal Bayesian decision strategy (to maximize the number of correct predictions, see ) in such a case is to always predict "positive" (i.e., predict the majority category in the absence of other information), which has 60% chance of winning rather than matching which has 52% of winning (where "p" is the probability of positive realization, the result of matching would be formula_1, here formula_2). The suboptimal probability-matching strategy is of psychological interest because it is frequently employed by human subjects in decision and classification studies.

Zastava M92

The Zastava M92 is a carbine developed and manufactured by Serbian Zastava Arms. It was developed from the Zastava M85 carbine, a nearly identical weapon with only difference in caliber, and with that, the magazine design. The M92 is actually a shortened version of the Zastava M70 assault rifle, which is alone a modified copy of the Soviet AKM assault rifle.
Overview.
The Zastava M92 chambers and fires the Soviet 7.62×39mm round. It is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, and selective fire firearm with an under folding metal stock. In general design, it is actually a modified hybrid of the Soviet AKMSU and AKS-74U carbines, but is easily distinguished by the design of pistol grip and especially by the handguard (which is longer), which is made out of a different wood type and has three cooling vents instead of the usual two. This feature gives the M92 less overheating on full auto mode.
The M92 also features a shorter barrel. Unlike most rifle rounds which would otherwise experience a loss of velocity out of a shorter barrel, the 7.62x39 round loses very little velocity when compared to a full length barrel. This makes it an excellent round for short-barrel rifles. The short barrel of the M92 may not lose enough velocity to even make a considerable difference when compared to the M70.
Design and features.
The M92 is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective fire, shoulder-fired weapon with an underfolding stock. In contrast to the M70, the M92 also features a flash eliminator on the barrel end, which reduces muzzle flash and allows the user to see the bullet's point of impact. Like all carbine rifles, the M92 has a shorter effective range, quicker overheating and lower penetration when compared to original rifle, but it also has its own advantages, it is more efficient in close combat, the handling is improved and it has a higher rate of fire. Other advantages of a shorter barrel also gives it more portability and ease of concealment, making it popular for vehicle crews, pilots and special forces.

Zoom burst

Zoom burst is a photographic technique, attainable with zoom lenses with a manual zoom ring.
Using the technique involves zooming while the shutter is open with a relatively slow shutter speed, generally below 1/60th of a second. For this reason low light or small apertures are required. It is also possible to achieve a similar effect with either computer software like Adobe Photoshop (after the photo has been shot) or a photographic filter. In these cases the shutter speed can be as fast as necessary.
Photographs taken with this technique are characterized by blurred streaks emanating from the center of the photograph. The effect is nearly identical to a motion blur image in which the camera is traveling towards the subject. For this reason the zoom burst is typically used to create an impression of motion towards the subject.
The term is sometimes attributed to Peter Bargh in his article Creative zoom bursts technique, though the technique is much older, appearing for instance in .

The Illusionist (2010 film)

The Illusionist () is a 2010 British-French animated comedy-drama film directed by Sylvain Chomet. The film is based on an unproduced script written by French mime, director and actor Jacques Tati in 1956. Controversy surrounds Tati's motivation for the script, which was written as a personal letter to his estranged eldest daughter, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel in collaboration with his long-term writing partner Henri Marquet, between writing for the films "Mon Oncle" and "Play Time".
The main character is a version of Tati animated by several people under the lead of Laurent Kircher. The plot revolves around a struggling illusionist who visits an isolated community and meets a young lady who is convinced that he is a real magician. Originally intended by Tati to be set in Czechoslovakia, Chomet relocated the film to Scotland in the late 1950s. According to the director, "It's not a romance, it's more the relationship between a dad and a daughter." Sony's US press kit declares that the "script for "The Illusionist" was originally written by French comedy genius and cinema legend Jacques Tati as a love letter from a father to his daughter, but never produced".
Plot.
The story is set in 1959 and is told with only a few brief snatches of heavily accented and often indistinguishable dialogue. A down-on-his-luck illusionist (known by his stage name, "Tatischeff") watches his popularity and employment in Paris dry up. He packs his meagre belongings and props, including an ill-tempered white rabbit, and moves to London. There he finds himself as the irrelevant act following a popular rock band. Despite his wounded pride, he adopts a nothing-to-lose attitude and continues plying his trade at yet smaller gatherings in bars, cafés, and private parties.
He accepts the invitation of a drunken party patron, taking a long, slow journey to a remote Scottish island (Iona in the Inner Hebrides). The small village's pub has only recently been wired for electricity, and he and his rabbit are appreciated for a time. Living modestly in a room above the pub, the illusionist encounters a young girl named Alice who is captivated by his otherworldly abilities and kind gestures, including a gift of new red shoes. Competition from more modern forms of entertainment follow the illusionist even to this idyll, and he soon moves on.
Alice believes the downtrodden performer possesses genuine supernatural powers, and follows him to Edinburgh, where he performs at a modest, out-of-the-way theater. They book a room in a rundown guest house favored by other fading performers (a trio of acrobats, a clown, and a ventriloquist). The illusionist sleeps on a small couch and the girl keeps busy by cleaning and cooking food that she shares with the neighbors. The girl's affections even tame the rabbit, but the illusionist's increasingly meager wages, lavished on a series of gifts for Alice, lead him to pawn off his magic kit and secretly take on more demeaning jobs. The other traditional performers become similarly depressed and destitute.
Unable to muster the courage to tell his starry-eyed admirer the truth about his fading trade, the illusionist continues giving until he has nothing more to offer. Alice meanwhile discovers the affection of a handsome young man, and once he sees them walking together, the illusionist opts to leave her with money and move on. His final message is a letter that says "Magicians do not exist." Alice subsequently moves in with her new boyfriend. The illusionist releases the rabbit on a verdant hillside where many other rabbits are seen. He is last seen on a train, where he declines one final opportunity to perform a magic trick for a child by returning a small crayon that the child has dropped, but not replacing it with an identical, but larger, crayon of his own.
The illusionist looks longingly at a photo throughout the film, though it is never revealed to the audience during the film. At the end of the film, a photo appears dedicating the film to author Tati's own daughter. During the final train trip, the illusionist looks at the photo for a last time, and his hand drops down where the photo can be vaguely seen, particularly in the Blu-ray release. It is apparently the same picture of Tati's daughter seen at the end of the film.
Production.
According to the 2006 reading of the script at the London Film School introduced by Chomet, "The great French comic Jacques Tati wrote the script of "The Illusionist" and intended to make it as a live action film with his daughter". Catalogued in the Centre National de la Cinématographie archives under the impersonal moniker "Film Tati Nº 4", the script was passed to Chomet by the caretakers of Tati's oeuvre, Jérôme Deschamps and Macha Makeïeff after Chomet's previous film "The Triplets of Belleville" was premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Chomet has said that Tati's youngest daughter, Sophie Tatischeff, had suggested an animated film when Chomet was seeking permission to use a clip from Tati's 1949 film "Jour de fête" as she did not want an actor to play her father. Sophie Tatischeff died on 27 October 2001, almost two years before the 11 June 2003 French release of "The Triplets of Belleville".
The film was made at Chomet's Edinburgh film studio, Django Films, by an international group of animators directed by Paul Dutton. It was estimated to cost around £10 million and was funded by Pathé Pictures. However, in a February 2010 press conference, Chomet said that it had ended up costing $17 million. "The Herald" says 180 creatives were involved, 80 of whom had previously worked on "The Triplets of Belleville". In "The Scotsman", Chomet cites 300 people and 80 animators. The film was primarily animated in Scottish Studios in Edinburgh (Django Films) and Dundee (ink.digital), with further animation done in Paris and London. The 2D part of animation sent in Paris has been executed at Neomis Animation studio, where animation department was directed by Antoine Antin and clean-up department by Grégory Lecocq. Around 5% of the work (mainly inbetweening and clean-up), was completed in South Korea.
Django Films was originally established with the intention to establish itself in the filmmaking scene with both animation and live action, however the company is being dismantled. Django was beset with production difficulties, first losing funding for its first animated feature, "Barbacoa". It then failed to secure funding for a BBC project that had been labelled "The Scottish Simpsons". Chomet was then fired from the directorial duties of "The Tale of Despereaux" by Gary Ross. Django Films were very far from employing the 250 artists that it would have been required for the project, an estimated figure reported by "Scotland on Sunday" in 2005.
Motives for the script.
Controversy has dogged "The Illusionist", with it being reported that "Tati was inspired to write the story in an attempt to reconcile with his eldest daughter, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel, whom he had abandoned when she was a baby. And although she's still alive today and may in fact be his only direct living relative, she is nowhere mentioned in the dedications, which has seriously annoyed some".
In January 2010, "The Guardian" published the article "Jacques Tati's lost film reveals family's pain" stating, "In 2000, the screenplay was handed over to Chomet by Tati's daughter, Sophie Tatischeff, two years before her death. Now, however, the family of Tati's illegitimate and estranged eldest child, Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel, who lives in the north-east of England, are calling for the French director to give her credit as the true inspiration for the film. The script of "L'illusionniste", they say, was Tati's response to the shame of having abandoned his first child and it remains the only public recognition of her existence. They accuse Chomet of attempting to airbrush out their painful family legacy again."
On 26 May 2010, renowned film critic Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" published a lengthy letter from Jacques Tati's middle grandson, Richard McDonald that pinpointed historical events in the private life of Jacques Tati that the family believe was his remorseful, melancholy inspiration to write, yet never make, "L'Illusionniste".
Chomet has a different opinion about the film's origins although acknowledging: "I never got to meet Sophie, or even speak to her about the script." Chomet said, "I think Tati wrote the script for Sophie Tatischeff. I think he felt guilty that he spent too long away from his daughter when he was working."
In a June 2010 interview for "The National", Chomet gave his personal reasons for his attraction to the script: "I have two young children, a four-year-old and a two-year-old. But I also have a daughter who is 17 who I don't live with because I separated from her mother. She was 12 when I started the project and you can feel things changing." This appears to mirror the regret of a broken paternal relationship that Tati had with his own daughter Helga Marie-Jeanne Schiel. Of the story, Chomet commented that he "fully understood why had not brought ["The Illusionist" to the screen. It was too close to him, and spoke of things he knew only too well, preferring to hide behind the figure of Monsieur Hulot".
Having corresponded with Tati's grandson, former Tati colleague and "Chicago Reader" film reviewer Jonathan Rosenbaum published an article entitled "Why I can't write about "The Illusionist"" in which he wrote, "Even after acknowledging that Chomet does have a poetic flair for composing in long shot that's somewhat Tatiesque, I remain skeptical about the sentimental watering-down of his art that Chomet is clearly involved with, which invariably gives short shrift to the more radical aspects of his vision". With McDonald being quoted saying "My grandmother and all his stage acquaintances during the 1930's/40's always maintained that was a great colleague as a friend and artist; he unfortunately just made a massive mistake that because of the time and circumstances he was never able to correctly address. I am sure his remorse hung heavy within him and it is for this reason that I believe Chomet's adaptation of "l'Illusionniste" does a great discredit to the artist that was Tati."
Release.
The first footage from the film was shown at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival. The film premiered at the Berlinale festival in February 2010. The film opened the 2010 Edinburgh International Film Festival on 16 June.

Critical response.
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 90% based on reviews from 114 critics, and reports a rating average of 8 out of 10. Its critical consensus is that "The Illusionist" is an "engrossing love letter to fans of adult animation, "The Illusionist" offers a fine antidote to garish mainstream fare."
In "Télérama", Cécile Mury gave the film a rating of four stars out of five. Mury compared it to the director's previous feature film: "This "Illusionist" is as tender and contemplative as the "Triplets" were farcical and uneasy. But we find the oblique look, the talent that is particular of Sylvain Chomet. ... This world of yesterday fleets between realism and poetry." Christophe Carrière of "L'Express" was not fully convinced by Chomet's directing, finding the story clever, but "blunted when Chomet lets himself be submerged by Tati's melancholy, delivering more of a homage to a master than a personal adaption. Nevertheless, it is otherwise a beautiful work, with impeccable graphics and provides some stunning sequences (based on carnivorous rabbit stew ...). One would have liked a little bit more, that's all."
Jonathan Meville of "The Scotsman" wrote: "Edinburgh's skyline has never looked so good, and if the city didn't exist it would be hard to believe somewhere so beautiful was real: if locals aren't inspired to take a walk up North Bridge or down Victoria Street after this, they never will be." Whilst also in "The Scotsman" Alistair Harkness commented that "Once you strip away the overwhelming wow factor of the film's design, the absence of strong characterisation ensures the end result is bleaker and less affecting than was probably intended".
Tati's biographer, David Bellos, reviewing "The Illusionist" in "Senses of Cinema" was highly critical of Chomet's adaptation stating "the film is a disaster". "The great disappointment for me and I think for all viewers is that what Chomet does with the material is… well, nothing. The story he tells is no more than the sketchily sentimental plotline of "L'Illusionniste". It's really very sad. All that artistry, all that effort, and all that money… for this".
Reviewing "The Illusionist" in "The New Yorker", Richard Brody commented "Sylvain Chomet ("The Triplets of Belleville") has directed an animated adaptation of Jacques Tati's 1956 screenplay, with none of Tati's visual wit or wild invention". "Chomet reduces Tati's vast and bilious comic vision to cloying sentimentality. The result is a cliché-riddled nostalgia trip. In French, English, and Gaelic".
Roger Ebert in his review wrote, "However much it conceals the real-life events that inspired it, it lives and breathes on its own, and as an extension of the mysterious whimsy of Tati". Calling it the "magically melancholy final act of Jacques Tati's career", he gave it four stars out of four.
Accolades.
The film won the 2010 European Film Awards and was nominated at the 68th Golden Globe Awards for Best Animated Feature Film. On 25 February 2011, "The Illusionist" won the first César Award for Best Animated Feature.
It was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film in the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to "Toy Story 3"; and an Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, losing to "How to Train Your Dragon".

Pedro Machuca

Pedro Machuca (born Toledo, Spain ca. 1490; died 1550) is mainly remembered as the Spanish architect responsible for the design of the Palace of Charles V (begun 1528) adjacent to the Alcazar in Granada. The significance of this work is that it represents likely the first major classic Renaissance style building in Spain. Culturally, it represents the urge by the conquering Christians to challenge the hegemony of Moorish architecture in the recently (1492) acquired province of Granada.
The details of his life are poorly known. Born in Toledo, he is said to have been a pupil or friends with Michelangelo and Pontormo. Returning to Spain in 1520, he worked as a painter in the Royal Chapel of Granada, as well as in Jaén, Toledo, and Uclés.

Chalco (altépetl)

Chālco was a complex pre-Columbian Nahua "altepetl" or confederacy in central Mexico. It was divided into the four sub-altepetl of Tlalmanalco/Tlacochcalco, Amaquemecan, Tenanco Texopalco Tepopolla and Chimalhuacan-Chalco, which were themselves further subdivided into "altepetl tlayacatl", each with its own "tlatoani" (king). Its inhabitants were known as the "Chālcatl" (singular) or "Chālcah" (plural).
In the 14th and early 15th centuries, flower wars were fought between the Chalca and the Aztecs. Serious war erupted in 1446. According to the Amaqueme historian Chimalpahin, this was because the Chalca refused a Mexica demand to contribute building materials for the temple of Huitzilopochtli. Chalco was finally conquered by the Aztecs under Moctezuma I in or around 1465, and the kings of Chalco were exiled to Huexotzinco. The rulerships were restored by Tizoc in 1486, who installed new "tlatoque". Chalco paid more tribute to Tenochtitlan in the form of food than any other region in the Valley of Mexico, probably because of its fertile soil and location.
The Spanish conquistadors Pedro de Alvarado and Bernardino Vázquez de Tapia reached Chalco in the fall of 1519. The Chalca allied with the Spaniards and participated in the defeat of the Aztecs. Hernán Cortés claimed Chalco for himself as an encomienda, but failed to maintain his possession of it. Chalco was designated a corregimiento by 1533. Several places outside the traditional region of Chalco were added to it in colonial times.

WBFD

WBFD is an American radio station in Bedford, Pennsylvania, the seat of government for Bedford County. WBFD operates at the assigned frequency of 1310 kHz and a maximum output power of 5,000 watts.
A Legacy of Top 40.
WBFD originally signed on the air on July 2, 1955, and was the very first radio station to serve Bedford County in this highly rural area. Broadcast from the local fire department, the new station took its call letters from the volunteer service (thus WBFD). WBFD had made its debut as rock 'n roll was still developing, and found itself as a popular voice for the new up and coming acts, as well as being a full-service community servant. For much of its existence, like many small AM stations of its time, it broadcast only from sunrise to sunset. 
On December 22, 1966, WBFD was joined by its new FM sister station. While the AM station broadcast a Top-40 playlist, the FM station WAKM-FM was launched as a programmed classical (Musak-like) station with no live on-air talent (aside from newsbreaks). The WAKM became WRAX in the early 1980s changing format to country (the station later became WOOX). WBFD-AM broadcast only between dawn and dusk until the mid-1980s, when the FCC granted WBFD nighttime power authorization. 
WBFD was relatively consistent in its format, retaining its Top 40 format until around 1990, when it was sold to Kessner Broadcasting Corporation.
Upon acquisition of the station, the format was switched from Top 40 to a mixture of contemporary Christian and easy listening music. The station was also relocated on the dial from 1310 kHz to the weaker position of 1600 kHz, formerly held by its chief competitor WAYC. The ownership by Kessner would be relatively short-lived, as the station would be sold to its competitor, WAYC, by the end of the century.
WBFD Today.
WBFD airs a news,talk and sports format.

Zastava M72

The Zastava M72 is a light machine gun developed and manufactured by then Yugoslav Zastava Arms company. Generally, the M72 is almost a direct copy of the Soviet RPK light machine gun, the only visual differences being in barrel, wooden stock, no side rail mount and slightly in design of the wooden handguard.
Overview.
The Zastava M72 chambers and fires the 7.62x39mm M43 round. It is a gas-operated, air-cooled, drum-fed firearm with a fixed stock. 
This weapon is a near copy of the Soviet RPK light machine gun. There are a few differences on the M72/M72A. It does not have a scope side rail mount, the butt is also different, having the shape of a regular AK-47 rifle. It has a reinforced receiver, night sights and no carrying handle. The barrel also differs from other RPK rifles because of the cooling fins to help with heat dissipation from prolonged fire. The M72 only appears with a heavy profile barrel as opposed to Russian and Romanian RPK rifles that can come in both light or heavy barrel configurations.
Variants.
Many variants have also been made in Iraq under the name of 'Tabuk', which are direct copies of the M70A and the M72.
Design details.
The Zastava M72/M72A is a gas-operated, air-cooled, drum-fed, selective fire, shoulder-fired weapon with a bipod. It is a squad automatic weapon, like the Soviet RPK but has unique design features.

<doc id="9732133" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9732133" title="Midpoint circle algorithm">
Midpoint circle algorithm

In computer graphics, the midpoint circle algorithm is an algorithm used to determine the points needed for drawing a circle. The Bresenham's line algorithm is derived from mid-pt circle algorithm, and is known as Bresenham's circle algorithm, . The algorithm can be generalized to conic sections.
The algorithm is related to work by Pitteway and Van Aken.
Algorithm.
The objective of the algorithm is to find a path through the pixel grid using pixels which are as close as possible to solutions of formula_1. At each step, the path is extended by choosing the adjacent pixel which satisfies formula_2 but maximizes formula_3. Since the candidate pixels are adjacent, the arithmetic to calculate the latter expression is simplified, requiring only bit shifts and additions.
This algorithm starts with the circle equation. For simplicity, assume the center of the circle is at formula_4. We consider first only the first octant and draw a curve which starts at point formula_5 and proceeds counterclockwise, reaching the angle of 45.
The "fast" direction here (the basis vector with the greater increase in value) is the formula_6 direction. The algorithm always takes a step in the positive formula_6 direction (upwards), and occasionally takes a step in the "slow" direction (the negative formula_8 direction).
From the circle equation we obtain the transformed equation formula_9, where formula_10 is computed only a single time during initialization.
Let the points on the circle be a sequence of coordinates of the vector to the point (in the usual basis). Points are numbered according to the order in which they are drawn, with formula_11 assigned to the first point formula_5.
For each point, the following holds:
This can be rearranged as follows:
And likewise for the next point:
In general, it is true that:
So we refashion our next-point-equation into a recursive one by substituting formula_18:
Because of the continuity of a circle and because the maxima along both axes is the same, we know we will not be skipping x points as we advance in the sequence. Usually we will stay on the same x coordinate, and sometimes advance by one.
The resulting co-ordinate is then translated by adding midpoint coordinates. These frequent integer additions do not limit the performance much, as we can spare those square (root) computations in the inner loop in turn. Again, the zero in the transformed circle equation is replaced by the error term.
The initialization of the error term is derived from an offset of ½ pixel at the start. Until the intersection with the perpendicular line, this leads to an accumulated value of formula_20 in the error term, so that this value is used for initialization.
The frequent computations of squares in the circle equation, trigonometric expressions and square roots can again be avoided by dissolving everything into single steps and using recursive computation of the quadratic terms from the preceding iterations.
Variant with Integer-Based Arithmetic.
Just as with Bresenham's line algorithm, this algorithm can be optimized for integer-based math. Because of symmetry, if an algorithm can be found that only computes the pixels for one octant, the pixels can be reflected to get the whole circle.
We start by defining the radius error as the difference between the exact representation of the circle and the center point of each pixel (or any other arbitrary mathematical point on the pixel, so long as it's consistent across all pixels). For any pixel with a center at formula_21, we define the radius error to be: 
For clarity, we derive this formula for a circle at the origin, but the algorithm can be modified for any location. We will want to start with the point formula_5 on the positive X-axis. Because the radius will be a whole number of pixels, we can see that the radius error will be zero: 
Because we are starting in the first CCW positive octant, we will step in the direction with the greatest "travel", the Y direction, so we can say that formula_25. Also, because we are only concerned with this octant only, we know that the X values only have 2 options: to stay the same as the previous iteration, or decrease by 1. We can create a decision variable that determines if the following is true:
If this inequality holds, we plot formula_27; if not, then we plot formula_28. So how do we determine if this inequality holds? We can start with our definition of radius error:
The absolute value function doesn't really help us, so let's square both sides, since the square is always positive:
Since x > 0, the term formula_31, so dividing we get:
Thus, we change our decision criterion from using floating-point operations to simple integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting (for the multiply by 2 operations). If "2(RE+YChange)+XChange > 0", then we decrement our X value. If "2(RE+YChange)+XChange <= 0", then we keep the same X value. Again, by reflecting these points in all the octants, we get the full circle.
Example.
The following C# integer implementation follows the logic very closely:
Drawing Incomplete Octants.
The implementations above always only draw complete octants or circles. To draw only a certain arc from an angle formula_33 to an angle formula_34, the algorithm needs first to calculate the formula_8 and formula_6 coordinates of these end points, where it is necessary to resort to trigonometric or square root computations (see Methods of computing square roots). Then the Bresenham algorithm is run over the complete octant or circle and sets the pixels only if they fall into the wanted interval. After finishing this arc, the algorithm can be ended prematurely.
Note that if the angles are given as slopes, then no trigonometry or square roots are required: one simply checks that formula_37 is between the desired slopes.
Generalizations.
Ellipses.
It is possible to generalize the algorithm to handle ellipses (of which circles are a special case). These algorithms involve calculating a full quadrant of the ellipse, as opposed to an octant as explained above, since non-circular ellipses lack the x-y symmetry of a circle.
One such algorithm is presented in the paper "A Fast Bresenham Type Algorithm For Drawing Ellipses" by John Kennedy. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120225095359/http://homepage.smc.edu/kennedy_john/belipse.pdf]
Parabola.
It is also possible to use the same concept to plot a parabola.

6 mm SAW

The 6mm SAW describes an experimental series of cartridges developed in the 1970s for the U.S. Army. The cartridges were produced in a variety of sizes and from a variety of materials. The intent was to develop a cartridge that would replace all 5.56×45mm NATO weapons as well as most 7.62×51mm NATO rifles and machine guns in the U.S. military. Eventually, the 5.56mm was retained and only the machine gun portion of the SAW (Squad Automatic Weapon) competition was successful. That program led to the M249 light machine gun.
Note that the dimensions listed to the right are for 6×45mm SAW rounds. Three versions were produced for testing in the early 1970s. An aluminum-cased version was developed, as well as the 6mm SAW Long which was slightly longer (by about 5 mm).
Design and development.
During the 1970s, the U.S. Army was looking to develop a new squad automatic weapon (SAW) that was lighter than the M60 machine gun with an effective range out to 800 m. The 7.62 mm cartridge was too heavy and the 5.56 mm cartridge could not provide effective performance at that range. Research led to the development of the 6×45mm SAW cartridge. Its bullet had a muzzle velocity of and muzzle energy of . The relatively heavy bullet combined with a moderate velocity had optimum long-range performance. A light-alloy cased version of the round was also produced. Because aluminium alloy had a tendency to catch fire, the case length was extended to to make up for loss in capacity caused by the need to line the inside of the case with fire-resistant material. Although the 6mm SAW's performance proved satisfactory, there were supply concerns over adopting a third rifle caliber. Development of the 6mm SAW was abandoned when an improved 5.56 mm round was promised, which arrived as the M855.

Tom Biggs

Tom Biggs (born 22 August 1984 in Hull, East Yorkshire) is a rugby union footballer for Bath RFC. His usual position is at wing. Biggs has featured in the Zurich Premiership, Powergen Cup and European Cup.
Biggs had not played any club rugby before joining the Yorkshire U18s, having only played with his school team at Hymers College. Biggs was spotted by the then Tykes Academy boss Stuart Lancaster and was asked to join the Tykes' Academy side.
Before the 2004–05 Zurich Premiership season, Biggs was considering a part-time rugby career with National Division Two team Harrogate Rugby Union Football Club, having failed to make an appearance in the Leeds Tykes first team. At the time, he was working in a cinema and in a pea factory to supplement his life as a business student at Leeds Metropolitan University, but by the end of the season he had collected a Powergen Cup winners medal.
He had been recalled by Tykes coach Phil Davies on the eve of the season as the club were forced to call on all their resources when faced with an injury crisis with Phil Christophers, Diego Albanese, Tim Stimpson and Iain Balshaw all unable to play. Biggs was included in the pre-season warm up games and was picked in the starting line up for the opening game of the season against Gloucester RFC on 5 September 2004, making his full debut in a 16–21 defeat at Headingley.
Biggs also featured in the next game against Leicester Tigers, scoring a try in a 20–42 defeat. He was first to react to a Gordon Ross cross field kick and chipped on ahead of Austin Healey to collect the ball and evade the cover tackle to touch down. The try was later short-listed for the Gillette Try of the season at the Zurich Awards.
Biggs made a total of 21 appearances in the 2004–05 season, helping the Tykes to avoid relegation from the Zurich Premiership with another try against Leicester in a 23–22 victory at Headingley. He ended his debut season with a place in the Tykes' Powergen Cup final against Bath Rugby, collecting his first winners medal in a 20–12 win. He was chosen ahead of Argentine wing Diego Albanese in the Tykes' side for the Twickenham clash.
After his first season, he was selected for the England team in the IRB U21s Championship in Argentina and was involved in the U21s’ Six Nations campaign, playing in their final clash with Scotland. He ended last season as the club's top try scorer and was voted Player of the Year.
Biggs, who was close to being selected for the England Saxons last summer, committed himself to the Tykes until 2009. He missed three months of the National Division One 2006/7 season, following a shoulder surgery that he suffered in September 2006. He had an operation to repair torn cartilage and a ligament, but returned to action in January 2007 as a replacement against Nottingham.
Biggs moved to the Newcastle Falcons on a one year contract for the 2009–10 season. He was also called into the England Saxons squad to face Italy A in Ragusa, Sicily on 9 February 2008. On 17 February 2010, it was announced that Biggs had signed a three-year deal to play for Bath.

<doc id="9732182" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9732182" title="Base rate">
Base rate

In probability and statistics, base rate generally refers to the (base) class probabilities unconditioned on featural evidence, frequently also known as prior probabilities. In plainer words, if it were the case that 1% of the public were "medical professionals", and 99% of the public were "not" "medical professionals", then the base rate of medical professionals is simply 1%.
In science, particularly medicine, the base rate is critical for comparison. It may at first seem impressive that 1000 people beat their winter cold while using 'Treatment X', until we look at the entire 'Treatment X' population and find that the base rate of success is actually only 1/100 (i.e. 100 000 people tried the treatment, but the other 99 000 people never really beat their winter cold). The treatment's effectiveness is clearer when such base rate information (i.e. "1000 people... out of how many?") is available. Note that controls may likewise offer further information for comparison; maybe the control groups, who were using no treatment at all, had their own base rate success of 5/100. Controls thus indicate that 'Treatment X' actually makes things worse, despite that initial proud claim about 1000 people.
The normative method for integrating base rates (prior probabilities) and featural evidence (likelihoods) is given by Bayes rule.
The base rate fallacy.
A large number of psychological studies have examined a phenomenon called base-rate neglect or "base rate fallacy"' in which category base rates are not integrated with featural evidence in the normative manner. Mathematician Keith Devlin provides an illustration of the risks of this: He asks us to imagine that there is a type of cancer that afflicts 1% of all people. A doctor then says there is a test for that cancer which is about 80% reliable. He also says that the test provides a positive result for 100% of people who have the cancer, but it also results in a 'false positive' for 20% of people - who actually do not have the cancer. Now, if we test positive, we may be tempted to think it is 80% likely that we have the cancer. Devlin explains that, in fact, our odds are less than 5%. What is missing from the jumble of statistics is the most relevant base rate information. We should ask the doctor ""Out of the number of people who test positive at all (this is the base rate group that we care about), how many end up actually having the cancer?"". Naturally, in assessing the probability that a given individual is a member of a particular class, we must account for other information besides the base rate. In particular, we must account for featural evidence. For example, when we see a person wearing a white doctor's coat and stethoscope, and prescribing medication, we have evidence which may allow us to conclude that the probability of this "particular" individual being a "medical professional" is considerably greater than the category base rate of 1%.

<doc id="9732183" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9732183" title="Classification of transsexual people">
Classification of transsexual people

The classification of transsexual people and people with other gender atypicalities has been done since the mid-1960s. In medicine and psychiatry, terms such as "heterosexual" and "homosexual" have been based on a person's sex assignment at birth, which has prompted the increased use of androphilia and gynephilia to avoid terminological confusion. In social and political contexts classification is often relative to one's desired sex.
Sex Orientation Scale (1966).
Harry Benjamin created the Sex Orientation Scale (SOS) to classify and understand various forms and subtypes of transvestism and transsexualism in biological males. It was a seven-point scale with three types of transvestism, three types of transsexualism, and one category for typical males. Benjamin's Scale references and uses the Kinsey scale in distinguishing between "true transsexualism" and "transvestism".
Benjamin noted, "It must be emphasized again that the remaining six types are not and never can be sharply separated." Benjamin added a caveat: "It has been the intention here to point out the possibility of several conceptions and classifications of the transvestitic and the transsexual phenomenon. Future studies and observations may decide which one is likely to come closest to the truth and in this way a possible understanding of the etiology may be gained."
"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual" (1980).
The "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association provides a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used in the United States and in varying degrees around the world, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and policy makers. The current version is the DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision). It is organized into a five-part 'axis' system, with the first axis incorporating 'clinical disorders' and the second covering personality disorders and intellectual disabilities. The remaining axes cover related medical, psychosocial and environmental factors, as well as assessments of functioning for children.
The manual evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a manual developed by the United States Army, and was substantially revised in 1980. There have been five revisions since it was first published in 1952, gradually including more mental disorders, although some have been removed and are no longer considered to be mental disorders. The last major revision was the fourth edition ("DSM-IV"), published in 1994, although a "text revision" was produced in 2000. The fifth edition ("DSM-5") is currently in consultation, planning and preparation, due for publication in May 2013. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO), is another commonly used manual which includes criteria for mental disorders. This is in fact the official diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US, but is used more widely in Europe and other parts of the world. The coding system used in the DSM-IV is designed to correspond with the codes used in the ICD, although not all codes may match at all times because the two publications are not revised synchronously.
The DSM has attracted praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria. It has also attracted controversy and criticism. Some critics argue that the DSM represents an unscientific system that enshrines the opinions of a few powerful psychiatrists. There are ongoing issues concerning the validity and reliability of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial symptoms; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from 'normality'; possible cultural bias; medicalization of human distress and financial conflicts of interest, including with the practice of psychiatrists and with the pharmaceutical industry; political controversies about the inclusion or exclusion of diagnoses from the manual, in general or in regard to specific issues; and the experience of those who are most directly affected by the manual by being diagnosed, including the consumer/survivor movement. The publication of the DSM, with tightly guarded copyrights, now makes APA over $5 million a year, historically adding up to over $100 million.
DSM-III.
"Transsexualism" was included for the first time in the DSM-III in 1980.
"Gender Identity Disorder" was a term created in the DSM-III in regard to transsexuals, and the categories were "GID/Children Transsexualism"; "GID/Adolescent and Adult, Non-transsexual type" and "GID/Not Otherwise Specified". Notably, this did not address Late-onset transsexualism, where patients may not have had symptoms as children. Interestingly, in the major revision of the DSM, DSM-III-R, they were placed in the category "Disorders Usually First Evident in Infancy, Childhood or Adolescence". The problem was that it got lost here, as well as the issue of adult onset explained above.
In the DSM-III, the terms "Homosexual", "Heterosexual", and "Asexual" were used - with quite a bit of confusion. (These terms were replaced in the DSM-IV by "Attracted to males", "Attracted to Females", "Attracted to Both" and "Attracted to neither.")
DSM-III-R.
The DSM-III-R, published in 1987, retained the term "transsexualism". It was located under "Disorders Usually First Evident in Infancy, Childhood or Adolescence".
DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR.
"Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents and Adults" replaced the term transsexualism. In the DSM-IV-TR, GID is placed in the category of Sexual Disorders, with the subcategory of Gender Identity Disorders. The names were changed in DSM-IV to "Gender Identity Disorder in Children", "Gender Identity Disorder in Adolescents or Adults", and "Gender Identity Disorder Not Otherwise Specified".
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems.
The "International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (most commonly known by the abbreviation ICD) is according to its publisher, the United Nations-sponsored World Health Organization "the standard diagnostic tool for epidemiology, health management and clinical purposes." It is known as a health care classification system that provides codes to classify diseases and a wide variety of signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or disease. Under this system, every health condition can be assigned to a unique category and given a code, up to six characters long. Such categories can include a set of similar diseases.
The International Classification of Diseases is published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and used worldwide for morbidity and mortality statistics, reimbursement systems, and automated decision support in health care. This system is designed to promote international comparability in the collection, processing, classification, and presentation of these statistics. The ICD is a core classification of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC).
The ICD is revised periodically and is currently in its tenth revision. The ICD-10, as it is therefore known, was developed in 1992 to track health statistics. ICD-11 is planned for 2015 and will be revised using Web 2.0 principles. Annual minor updates and triennial major updates are published by the WHO. The ICD is part of a "family" of guides that can be used to complement each other, including also the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health which focuses on the domains of functioning (disability) associated with health conditions, from both medical and social perspectives.
In the ICD-10, transsexualism is located within Gender identity disorders, F64 in under the heading "Disorders of adult personality and behaviour".
Blanchard's transsexualism typology (1980s).
Blanchard's transsexualism typology (also Blanchard autogynephilia theory (BAT) and Blanchard's taxonomy) is a psychological typology of male-to-female transsexualism created by Ray Blanchard through the 1980s and 1990s, building on the work of his colleague, Kurt Freund. Blanchard divides male-to-female (MtF or M2F) transsexuals into two different groups: "homosexual transsexuals", who are attracted to men, and "non-homosexual transsexuals", who are "autogynephilic" (sexually aroused by the thought or image of themselves as a woman). The typology does not purport to identify the cause of transsexualism in natal males, but it has some implications for the cause—specifically, that the cause of transsexualism may not be the same for both groups.
Scientific criticism of the research and theory has come from John Bancroft, Jaimie Veale, Larry Nuttbrock, Charles Allen Moser, and others who argue that the theory is poorly representative of MtF transsexuals, reduces gender identity to a matter of attraction, is non-instructive, and that the research cited in support of the theory has inadequate control groups or is contradicted by other data. Supporters of the theory include J. Michael Bailey, Anne Lawrence, James Cantor, Kay Brown, and others who argue that there are significant differences between the two groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. 
The theory has been the subject of protests in the transsexual and larger LGBT community, although it has its supporters. The issues with Blanchard's work were again the subject of criticism with the publication of Bailey's "The Man Who Would Be Queen" in 2003. In 2005, Blanchard distanced himself from Bailey's affirmation of the scientific certainty of the etiology, expressing that further research was needed before said certainty could be sufficiently justified.

Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound

The Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound (SASSAS) is a non profit organization that serves to promote the creation, presentation, and recognition of experimental art and sound events in the greater Los Angeles area. SASSAS members are interested in how experimental art, architecture and music interact. 
History.
To encourage this interaction in a social context, Los Angeles artist Cindy Bernard initiated the “sound.” concert series in 1999, providing forums where musicians from diverse backgrounds could work together. In 2000, “sound.” moved to the "MAK Center for Art and Architecture" at the Schindler House in West Hollywood. This informal residential setting enabled audiences to enjoy an intimate musical experience while surrounded by an important example of modern architecture. Building on the success of “sound.”, SASSAS was incorporated and a Board of Directors formed in 2002. Starting in 2004, SASSAS developed partnerships with larger venues such as REDCAT and the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, bringing even greater exposure to the Los Angeles experimental community. 
To date, more than 40 concerts have been presented including performances by Pauline Oliveros, James Tenney, Nels Cline, Petra Haden, Wadada Leo Smith, Phil Cohran, Roscoe Mitchell, Joseph Jarman, Harold Budd, Glenn Branca, Tetuzi Akiyama and many others.
In addition to producing concerts, SASSAS maintains an extensive on-line audio archive of past concerts.

Lampocteis

Lampocteis is a monotypic genus of comb jellies, the only genus in family Lampoctenidae. The sole species in this new genus is Lampocteis cruentiventer, the bloodybelly comb jelly. This ctenophore was first collected in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego, California, in 1979. It was described to science in 2001. Two morphological differences separating it from previously known comb jellies warranted the naming of a new family for this animal.
This mesopelagic jelly ranges in color from deep red, purple, or black to pale purple. The deep color of its belly may mask the animal's bioluminescence to hide it from potential predators. Its "combs," rows of cilia on its body, have a sparkling iridescence. Specimens examined have ranged between 1.5 and 16 centimeters in length and 1.2 to 10 centimeters in width. Comb jellies do not sting and recent studies have shown that they are not actually cnidarians. In fact scientists do not know what the comb jellies ancestors are.

Life and career.
Bagemihl served on the faculty of University of British Columbia, and he earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from there in 1988. "Biological Exuberance" cites numerous studies on some 300 species (see List of animals displaying homosexual behavior) showing that homosexual and bisexual behaviors are common among animals and proposes a theory of sexual behavior in which reproduction is only one of its principal biological functions. Bagemihl proposes that group cohesion and lessening of tensions, seen for example among bonobos, are other important functions of sexual behavior.
"Biological Exuberance" was cited in the U.S. Supreme Court case "Lawrence v. Texas" as evidence that homosexual behavior is natural, and formed the basis for the museum exhibition Against Nature?.

London System

The London System is a complex of related chess openings that begin with 1.d4 followed by an early Bf4. It comprises a smaller body of opening theory than many other openings and normally results in a closed game. Sverre Johnsen and Vlatko Kovačević, in the introduction to their 2005 book "Win with the London System", state: 
Basically the London is a set of solid lines where after 1.d4 White quickly develops his dark-squared bishop to f4 and normally bolsters his centre with on c3 and e3 rather than expanding. Although it has the potential for a quick kingside attack, the white forces are generally flexible enough to engage in a battle anywhere on the board. Historically it developed into a system mainly from three variations:
The corresponding "Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings" codes are D02, A46, and A48. 
Description.
The line came into fashion in the 1922 London tournament as a way of meeting hypermodern setups. The line gives White a solid position, and critics of the line refer to it as the "old man’s variation" or the "boring system". Even so, the opening can lead to sharp attacks and Vlatko Kovačević and David Bronstein are among the sharp tactical players who have played the London System.
Early play.
1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Bf4.
This position can also be reached by 1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Bf4. Black may play 3...e6, then White can play 4.e3 or 4.Nbd2. Black may play 3...c5, then White can play 4.e3 or 4.c3. Black may play 3...Bf5 symmetrical, then White can play 4.e3. Black may play 3...c6, then White can play 4.e3 or 4.c3.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 e6 3.Bf4.
Black may play 3...b6, then White can play 4.e3, follows 4...Bb7 5.Nbd2 Be7 or 5.Bd3. Black may play 3...c5, then White can play 4.e3, or 4.c3, follows 4...Nc6 5.e3 or 4...b6. Black may play 3...d5, then White can play 4.e3, follows 4...c5 5.c3 Nc6 6.Nbd2, 4...Bd6 5.Bd3, or 4..,Be7 5.Bd3; or, 4.Nbd2.
1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 g6 3.Bf4.
Black may play 3...Bg7, then White can play 4.e3 or 4.h3 or 4.Nbd2 or 4.c3. Black may play 3...d6, then White can play 4.e3 or 5.Be2 or 4.h3. Note that 4.e3 is a good move in any case.

The Lakes (TV series)

The Lakes is the title of a television drama series in the United Kingdom, made by the BBC and created and principally written by Jimmy McGovern. "The Lakes" brought writer Jimmy McGovern and actor John Simm a great deal of critical praise in 1997. Following a particularly dry period for British TV drama, the show's realistic characters and their painfully honest decisions hit audiences hard. Simm plays Danny Kavanagh; a twenty-something trapped in a life of compulsive gambling, theft, and being on the dole in Liverpool. On a whim he heads north to the Lake District. He expects to find countryside quiet where he might explore his hidden poetical leanings, but gets caught up in a community like any other. Lies, temptation and tragedy beset every household just as much as the big city. As time races by, Danny's link to the Lakes becomes an exercise in torment when he is suspected after the accidental deaths of three schoolgirls. Stoking the flames of a series of secondary explosions in waiting are a pair of affairs, one adulterous, the other complicated by religion.
In the far longer sequel series that came two years later, these back-stories would come to the fore. The series explores a Hitchcockian murder scenario, with series two expressing more black humour that was obvious in series one. The second series received very mixed reviews, with most critics saying it had left realism for high melodrama and contrived plots. Critics said that McGovern's lower level of participation in the writing about his characters and situations, resulted in deviations from their consistency from the first series.
Overview.
The core of both series is the relationship between Danny Kavanagh (John Simm) and Lucy Archer (Kaye Wragg). In Series One, Danny is a compulsive gambler and philanderer, who escapes from the dole queues in Liverpool to live in the Lake District. After he meets and marries local girl Emma Quinlan, they move back to Liverpool. Emma finally returns home because of Danny's gambling. He follows her, gets a job looking after a rowing boat concession, and starts to patch up his relationship with Emma, who now has a daughter. 
Danny rejects unsubtle advances from the attention-seeking Lucy Archer, who determines to gain revenge. When three schoolgirls are drowned in a boating accident while Danny is on the phone to the bookies, Lucy lies to implicate him. Danny is unwilling to tell the truth, as he has promised to stop gambling. The community looks for someone to blame, and Lucy is exposed as a liar in the subsequent inquest. Phone call records provide Danny with an alibi. 
In Series two, Lucy is raped by three locals. Only Danny, enduring the claustrophobic hostility of the Quinlan family home, can testify as a witness, putting him at odds with the village, his wife and her family.
Reception.
The series was critically acclaimed when first broadcast. It caused controversy because of its hard-hitting portrayal of an immoral British sub-culture, and scenes of sex and violence. "The Lakes" was the springboard for the British TV drama careers of many of the cast.
Location.
The series was principally filmed in and around Patterdale and The Ullswater Hotel, Glenridding. The lake is Ullswater.
DVD release.
Released as a 4-disc set in 2003. Series 1, episode 1 has commentaries by John Simm and David Blair.
The Lakes is rated R16 in New Zealand and for offensive language and sex scenes.

Glover and Main was a British manufacturer of gas meters and stoves located at Angel Road, Edmonton, London.
History.
T. Glover & Co manufactured gas meters at the Gothic Works from 1897. Thomas Glover invented the original diaphragm gas meter in 1843. The company later amalgamated with R&A Main gas stove makers. During the 20th century they became one of the largest manufacturers of gas cookers in the UK. A new factory was built in 1951 on part of the Gothic Works. The business was taken over by THORN Electrical Industries in 1965. Production ceased in 1983.
The former Gothic Works was demolished late in the 20th century and is now known as Glover Close which is a retail area comprising a Tesco and an Ikea store which opened on 10 February 2005 where a serious crowd disturbance took place.

Gherardo Starnina (c. 1360–1413) was an Italian painter from Florence in the Quattrocento era.
According to the biographer Giorgio Vasari, Starnina initially trained with Antonio Veneziano, then with Agnolo Gaddi. He is claimed to have participated in the painting of the frescos in the "Castellani Chapel" in Basilica di Santa Croce, Florence. He is also said to have moved to Spain in 1380 to work under Juan I of Castile, and is attributed some painting in the "San Blas chapel" of the Cathedral of Toledo.
Several paintings formerly attributed to the Master of the Bambino Vispo are now attributed to Gherardo Starnina, and the two artists may have been the same person.

Benickebrinken

Södra/Norra Benickebrinken (Swedish: "Southern/Northern Slope of Benicke") are two sloping streets in Gamla stan, the old town in central Stockholm, Sweden, stretching from Österlånggatan up to Svartmangatan.
The Salvation Army opened a pantry on Number 2 in 1891 and a night refuge for homeless men the following year, both institutions remained in operation until the 1970s. Today the building is used as a board-and-lodging accommodation for alcoholics.
Public toilets were installed under the slope in 2005-2006.
Etymology.
The present name is derived from a "Jören Benick", a man who had a tavern here named "Solen" ("The Sun") after the sign hanging in the street. The tavern was located in a block demolished in the end of the 19th century and located on the eastern side of the then extremely narrow slopes. It was later taken over by Jören's grandsons, both mentioned as the city's official innkeepers in the beginning of the 17th century.
The slopes were originally named "Svartbrödrabrinken" and "Svartmunkabrinken" ("Black Brother's/Monk's Slope") after the Black Friars' Monastery located on the western side of the southern slope until the Reformation (1520-1530). The monastery was built on land given to the Dominicans following the coronation of King Magnus Eriksson (1316–1377) in 1336. A cellar from the monastery, at the time serving as a lodging and still containing the original stoves, is found under the present building on number 4. A pattern of sets in the street Prästgatan still shows the extent of the monastery walls, and human bones discovered during an archaeological excavation in 1993 showed the graveyard of the monastery extended well into the northern part of the present southern slope.
History.
Before King Sigismund's (1566-1632) arrival to Stockholm in 1593, a large number of accommodations and taverns were urged to be put in order all over the city, and, to guide foreign guests, the taverns were requested to put signs in the streets displaying symbols "like is the manner abroad". By the early 17th century, however, the number of taverns and lodging houses didn't by far match the demand, so the mayor reintroduced an ordinance stipulating two inns in every block; the tavern of Benicke together with five other taverns is shortly thereafter given a charter, requesting the premises to be used exclusively for the purpose — "all wine, beer, and other foreign beverages
be sold and tapped" ("all wijn, ööll och andra fremmande drycker selias och upptappas").
In various contemporary sources, the house of Benicke not only gradually gave its name to the slopes, but was also used as a point of references: In 1564, a house is said to be located "by Blackfriars slope right across Jörenn Beneke's house" ("wiid Swartmunka brincken twerth vtöffver Jörenn Benekes huss"). In 1605, a house offered for sale is said to be located "in Jörenn Benichson's slope, on the north side of Jörenn Benichsons house" ("i Jören Benichsons brinck, på nörre sidhenn om Jörenn Benichsons hus"), and his name appears again in 1622 when another building is put up for sale. Finally, on a map dated 1733 the slopes are labelled with their present names ("Nor och Söder Benike Brincken").

Mansfield Plantation

Mansfield Plantation is a well-preserved antebellum rice plantation, established in 1718 on the banks of the Black River in historic Georgetown, South Carolina. Spanning nearly of pine forest, rice fields and cypress swamps, Mansfield Plantation was once one of the largest rice producing plantations in the country. Mansfield, along with adjacent rice plantations up and down the Black River, provided much of Europe with "Carolina Gold" rice during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Rice growing was made possible by 1) perfecting irrigation techniques using tidal water and manmade dykes; 2) experimentation with natural fertilizers; 3) and most notably, African-American slave labor. After the American Civil War, rice production became too expensive and soon the plantations fell into bankruptcy and were sold off to new owners.
Today, Mansfield Plantation is preserved as an authentic rice plantation, complete with the original plantation home, a school house, live oak avenue ("oak alley"), chapel, guest house and grounds. It also has the only remaining winnowing barn in Georgetown County, where rice grains were processed for shipment. Undergoing restoration is a slave village of 7 slave cabins and a chapel. As of 2009, the entire plantation is undergoing a privately funded, massive restoration project to keep its distinct history alive for generations to come. It is said to be the only American plantation be saved from development and reclaimed by a direct descendent of the original owners. 
Mansfield Plantation has been featured in numerous films, documentaries and television shows. It served as the backdrop for scenes from Mel Gibson's 2000 film, "The Patriot". In 2006, the Fox network filmed two segments of their primetime television series "Treasure Hunters" at Mansfield and the Fine Living Network filmed a documentary at Mansfield Plantation for their television series "Windshield America".

William Fuller (American football)

William Henry Fuller, Jr. (born March 8, 1962) is a retired American football player who played defensive end for 13 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Fuller played college football at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and professionally for the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars of the United States Football League (USFL), and the Houston Oilers, Philadelphia Eagles, and San Diego Chargers of the NFL. Fuller was one of the better pass rushers in the NFL during his time in the league and finished his career with 100.5 sacks. He was named to the Pro Bowl four times and selected as an All-American twice while in college. During his career and after his retirement, Fuller has also done considerable work in raising funds for diabetes research.
Early years.
Fuller was born in Norfolk, Virginia. He grew up in Chesapeake, Virginia, and attended Indian River High School, where he lettered in track, basketball, and football. Fuller graduated from Indian River in 1980.
College career.
Fuller attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he played defensive line for the North Carolina Tar Heels football team. He recorded nine sacks and 22 tackles for loss as a sophomore. As a senior he had 81 tackles, a team-leading five sacks, and 22 tackles for loss. For his efforts that season he was awarded All-America and first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) honors as well as UNC's defensive Most Valuable Player award. Fuller was also a finalist for the Lombardi and Outland Trophies, special awards designated only for linemen. While at UNC, Fuller helped lead the Tar Heels to three bowl games, made the All-ACC team three times, and the All-America team twice (1982 and 1983). He graduated in 1986 with a degree in psychology. Fuller was later inducted into UNC's sports hall of fame, and selected as a member of the ACC's 50th Anniversary Football Team in 2002.
Professional career.
Fuller was selected by the Philadelphia Stars of the USFL in the 1984 USFL player draft. He was also selected with the 21st selection in the first round of the 1984 NFL Supplemental Draft of USFL and CFL Players by the Los Angeles Rams. Fuller decided to play in the USFL with the Stars, where he played for two seasons, winning two USFL championships and playing with future NFL players such as Bart Oates and Sam Mills. Fuller was granted free agency by the USFL in 1986 and his rights were subsequently traded by the Rams to the Houston Oilers where he started his career in the NFL. After recording a total of 3 sacks in his first two seasons, Fuller emerged in 1988 and tied for the team lead in sacks with 8.5. He was described as the most improved defensive player on the team by head coach Jerry Glanville. After recording 14.5 sacks over 1989 and 1990, Fuller finished tied for second in the NFL with 15 sacks in 1991, and was named to his first Pro Bowl. He followed that up by recording eight and ten sacks, respectively in 1992 and 1993. After the 1993 season Fuller signed a three-year $8 Million contract as a free agent with the Philadelphia Eagles, in part out of a desire to be closer to his off–season home in Virginia. He subsequently played three stellar seasons in 1994, 1995, and 1996. He recorded 9.5 sacks in his first season there (1994) and set a team record for most consecutive games with a sack at seven.*Eagles Timeline, philadelphiaeagles.com, accessed February 27, 2007.</ref> Fuller had 13 sacks in each of the following two seasons (1995 and 1996), and was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his three seasons with the Eagles. After the 1996 season Fuller signed a two-year $5.6 million contract with the San Diego Chargers, while there his production steeply declined. After two seasons, in which he recorded three sacks each, Fuller retired following the 1998 season. By the time his NFL career ended Fuller had recorded 100.5 sacks becoming one of the few players in NFL history to record more than 100 sacks.
Personal life.
Fuller has four daughters by his wife Precilla, Karen, Krystal, Kimberly, and Kalisa . Shortly before the 1995 season Fuller's father, who was blind at the time due to diabetes, died. Fuller and his father were very close and had filmed a United Way and the NFL commercial together during the offseason. The commercial, which featured an organization for the blind, was not aired until two days after his father's death. Fuller is also a noted philanthropist, who was actively involved in programs relating to Juvenile diabetes, Special Olympics, Ronald McDonald House and the Boys' Clubs of America during his time in the NFL. He hosts the William Fuller Tournament in Houston for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. The event has raised over $1 million for research to cure diabetes, and Fuller himself has helped raise over $3 million for diabetes research. Fuller currently owns and operates his own real estate development company, Fulco Development, which is based in Norfolk. His company is currently working on development projects in the Hampton Roads region. He has also donated his time as an assistant football coach for Frank W. Cox High School in Virginia Beach. In 2011, Fuller became a radio commentator for the Virginia Destroyers UFL team.

Randy Matthews

Randy Matthews (born 1950) is a Christian singer-songwriter, guitarist, and pioneer of Jesus music. He was born into a family with at least five ordained ministers, including his father, Monty, a founding member of the "Jordanaires". When Randy was in high school in Lamar, Mo., he sang in a quartet called "The Zionaires", which was also founded by his father. This quartet performed regionally and sang in quartet competitions. Other members of the group included Noel Scott, baritone; Spike (Carl) Bickel, tenor; and Dan Fields, bass.
Randy briefly attended Ozark Bible College in Joplin, Mo. During this time he joined Noel Scott and Charlene Munger in the developing movement of Christian folk music. This experience helped Matthews to choose a less traditional path to ministry. After leaving college, he founded a coffee house ministry in Cincinnati with the purpose of promoting social activities among Christians and providing a safe haven for street people.
In 1971 Randy was signed as the first contemporary Christian artist to record for Word Records, a gospel label which had, up to that point, released spoken word recordings and albums of traditional gospel music. His first album was "Wish We'd All Been Ready". With the release of his second album, "All I Am Is What You See", Word launched a new label called Myrrh Records, created specifically to tap into the musical interests of the burgeoning Jesus movement.
Randy's music and concert style has always pushed the envelope. In 1974, Randy was invited to perform at The Jesus Festival, a Woodstock type event in which attenders camped out and listened to Christian music and Bible teaching for three days. When Matthews' band took the stage, the promoters and many in the crowd were shocked at their rock and roll presentation; up to this point most contemporary Christian music was more influenced by folk than rock. Matthews' band was unplugged by the promoters and chased off the stage by the concert-goers. Randy referenced this experience on his fourth album, 1975's "Eyes to the Sky", with a song called Pennsylvania song: "you pulled the plug and drained my soul, but I know I left a ring around the tub of tradition, I saw some dance and sing" and again in his ninth solo album, titled "Plugged In".
Randy Matthews is currently working under the stage name Red Beard, performing frequently at the Trade Winds Resort in St. Petersburg Beach, Florida and the Palm Island Resort. He recently released an album of pirate songs and tall tales called "Red Beard Pirate King".

Sekishō Line

The is a railway line in Japan operated by Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido). The main Sekishō Line connects in Chitose and Shintoku Station in the town of Shintoku. A branch line connects to . The name of the line comes from the subprefectures along the route, namely and .
Services.
The line is a part of the main line between and eastern Hokkaido. "Super Ōzora" limited express trains run between Sapporo and 7 times a day, while "Super Tokachi" runs twice daily, "Tokachi" 4 times daily, both between Sapporo and .

Passing loops and junctions.
Passing Loops between Kami-Ochiai Junction and Shintoku.
There are three passing loops shared by the Sekishō Line and Nemuro Main Line between Kami-Ochiai Junction and Shintoku Station.
History.
In 1892, the Hokkaido Colliery and Railway Company opened the from Oiwake to Yūbari for transporting coal to the Port of Muroran via the Muroran Main Line.
In 1906, the Japanese Government nationalised the company, and double-tracked the line between 1912 and 1919. However, the line was single-tracked in 1932. The abandoned western tunnel north of Shimizusawa, and significant portions of the second line formation are still visible.
The Minami-Chitose - Oiwake and Shin-Yūbari - Kami-Ochiai Junction (on the Nemuro Main Line) sections opened in 1981, becoming the two ends of the Sekishō Line. The Yūbari Line was renamed in two sections, the section between Oiwake and Shin-Yūbari becoming the mid section of the Sekishō Line, and the section between Shin-Yūbari and Yūbari becoming the Yūbari Branch Line of the Sekishō Line. The new line shortened the main route to eastern Hokkaido. Previously, passengers to Shintoku and further east had to travel via the Nemuro Main Line. 
In 1985 the Yubari station was relocated 1.3 km south of its original location, and it was moved another 800 m south in 1990.
Former connecting lines.
In 1916, a 7.6 km branch opened from Momijiyama (later Shin-Yubari) to Noborikawa, approximately on the same alignment as the later Shin-Yubari - Kami-Ochiai Junction line. It closed in 1980.
Three separate private railways connected to the Yubari line:
Accidents.
2011 "Super Ōzora" derailment and fire.
On 27 May 2011, the "Super Ōzora" 14 service from Kushiro to Sapporo was brought to an emergency stop inside the 685 metre-long No. 1 Niniu Tunnel in Shimukappu, Hokkaidō, at around 21:55 after car number 2 of the 6-car formation became derailed. The train caught fire, and all of the 245 people on board, including train staff eventually evacuated the train. 39 were treated for smoke inhalation and minor burn injuries. The burnt-out train was removed from the tunnel on 29 May 2011.
2012 Higashi-Oiwake Station derailment.
At around 20:50 on 16 February 2012, a freight train derailed at Higashi-Oiwake Station after passing a signal at red and colliding with the wall of a snow shelter adjacent to the station.
The up container freight train from Kushiro Freight Terminal to Sapporo Freight Terminal was normally scheduled to pass Higashi-Oiwake Station non-stop, but on this occasion faced a red signal to allow the delayed down "Super Ōzora" 13 service to pass in the opposite direction. The driver reportedly applied the brakes, but the train failed to stop and was derailed by the catch points protecting the single-track line, hitting the wall of a snow shelter protecting the junction. The JR Freight Class DF200 diesel locomotive and four of the container wagons in the train were derailed, but the lone 25-year-old driver was uninjured. Six train services were cancelled as a result.

Sekihoku Main Line

Services.
The "Okhotsk" limited express train, named after the Sea of Okhotsk, runs from Sapporo to Abashiri four times a day in summer, six times a day in winter. The limited rapid train "Kitami" operates between Asahikawa and Kitami, with one return service daily.
As for the local service, the line is roughly divided into three segments. In the segment between Asahikawa and Kamikawa, the line functions as a commuter rail of Asahikawa City. There is one local train service per one to two hours. The segment between Kamikawa and Engaru is a sparsely populated area. Between Kakikawa and Shirataki, a local train runs one lap per day. For the segment between Engaru and Abashiri, there is one local train service per one to two hours.
History.
The principle route between Sapporo and Okhotsk Subprefecture has changed several times. Originally, the route was the Hakodate Main Line to Asahikawa, then the southbound Nemuro Main Line and then the northbound line from Ikeda, via the to Kitami. The route shortened by 53.5km when the section between Takikawa and Furano on the Nemuro Main Line opened in 1913.
Another route, northbound from Asahikawa to Nayoro, then southeast to Kitami was completed as the and in 1921.
A third route was a shortcut between Asahikawa and Engaru, straight through the Kitami Pass. The , completed in 1932, finally completed the main route still used today.
The current Sekihoku Main Line consists of the remnants of these three lines. The section between Shin-Asahikawa and Engaru is from the Sekihoku Line, the section between Engaru and Kitami from the Yūbetsu Line, and the section between Kitami and Abashiri from the Abashiri Main Line.
The first of the abovementioned sections to open was from Abashiri to Kitami in 1912. The Kitami - Engaru line was opened between 1912-15 as a 762mm (2'6") gauge line, but was converted to 1067mm (3'6") gauge in 1916.
The Asahikawa - Kamikawa section opened in 1922-23, and the Engaru - Shiritaki section in 1927-29. The final section, including the Ishikita tunnel, opened in 1932.
Former connecting lines.
The abovementioned 140km Kitami - Ikeda line was transferred to private operation in 1989, and closed 2006.
A 37km line from Bihoro - Kitami Aioi opened 1924/25, and closed in 1985. A 22km logging tramway operated from Tsubetsu station on this line 1927-63.
The 90km Yumo line connected Abashiri to Nakayubestsu on the Naroyo line, opening in sections 1935-53 and closing in 1987.

Service outline.
The line forms part of the trunk route between Sapporo and southern Hokkaido. As such, "Super Hokuto" and "Hokuto" limited express trains run between Sapporo and Hakodate once every 1 to 2 hours, as well as the "Suzuran" between Sapporo and Muroran.
There also are sleeper trains between Honshu and Hokkaido, such as the "Hokutosei", "Cassiopeia", "Twilight Express", and "Hamanasu".
The segment between Sapporo and Minami-Chitose is also a part of the trunk route between Sapporo and eastern Hokkaido. The limited express trains "Super Ōzora", "Super Tokachi", and "Marimo" run through.
The rapid train "Airport" runs once every 15 minutes, functioning as the airport rail link between New Chitose Airport Station and Sapporo, Otaru, or Asahikawa. Since the Chitose Line goes through the most urbanized area in Hokkaido, there are roughly 3 to 4 local train services per an hour.
History.
The entire line opened on 21 August 1926. The Chitose-Eniwa section was double-tracked in September 1965, and extended to Kitahiroshima in September 1966.
The Chitose-Uenae section was double-tracked in 1968, and extended to Numanohata in 1969. The Shiraishi-Kitahiroshima section was double-tracked in 1973, completing the work to double-track the line.
Chitose Station and its approaches were elevated in 1980, and the line was electrified in association with the opening of the nearby Chitose airport.
The Minami (translates as South) Chitose - Chitose Airport branch opened as an electrified line in 1992.

<doc id="9732389" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9732389" title="Self-help book">
Self-help book

A self-help book is one that is written with the intention to instruct its readers on solving personal problems. The books take their name from "Self-Help", an 1859 best-seller by Samuel Smiles, but are also known and classified under "self-improvement", a term that is a modernized version of self-help. Self-help books moved from a niche position to being a postmodern cultural phenomenon in the late twentieth century.
Early history.
Informal guides to everyday behaviour might be said to have existed almost as long as writing itself. Certainly ancient Egyptian "Codes" of conduct 'have a curiously modern note: "you trail from street to street, smelling of beer...like a broken rudder, good for nothing...you have been found performing acrobatics on a wall!"'. Indeed, 'some social observers have suggested that the Bible is really the first and most significant and most helpful of self-help books. 
In Western culture, a line of descent may be traced back from Samuel Smiles' "Self-Help" to when 'the Renaissance concern with self-fashioning produced a flood of educational and self-help materials': thus 'the Florentine Giovanni della Casa in his book of manners published in 1558 suggests: "It is also an unpleasant habit to lift another person's wine or his food to your nose and smell it"'. The Middle Ages saw the genre personified in ' "Conduir-amour" ("guide in love matters")'; while in classical Rome Cicero's "On Friendship" and "On Duties" became 'handbooks and guides...through the centuries' - not to mention Ovid's "Art of Love" and "Remedy of Love". The former has been described as 'the best sex book, as valid for San Francisco and London as for ancient Rome', dealing as it does 'with practical problems of everyday life: where to go to meet girls, how to start a conversation with them, how to keep them interested, and...how to be sociable rather than athletic in bed'; the latter, equally essential, contains 'a series of instructions, as frank as they are ingenious and brilliantly expressed, on falling out of love'.
The postmodern phenomenon.
It is however in the last half-century or so that the humble self-help book has jumped to cultural prominence, a fact admitted by both the advocates and the critics - often highly polarised - of the self-improvement genre. Some would 'view the buying of such books...as an exercise in self-education'. Others, more critical, still concede that 'it is too prevalent and powerful a phenomenon to overlook, despite belonging to "pop" culture'.
For better or worse, it is clear that self-help books have had 'a very important role in developing social concepts of disease in the twentieth century', and that they 'disseminate these concepts through the general public so that ordinary people acquire a language for describing some of the complex and ineffable features of emotional and behavioral life'.
Where traditional psychology and psychotherapy will tend to be written in an impersonal, objective mode, many self-help books 'involve a first-person involvement and often a conversion experience': in keeping with the self-help support groups on which they often draw, horizontal peer-support and validation is thus offered the reader, as well as advice "from above". 
Yet arguably with the movement from the self-help "group" to the individual "self-improvement" reader something of that peer support has been lost, reflecting the broader way that 'over the course of the last three decades of the twentieth-century, there has been a significant shift in the meaning of "self-help"'. A collective enterprise has become a refashioning of the individual self: 'in less than thirty years, "self-help" - once synonymous with mutual aid - has come to be understood...as a largely individual undertaking'.
Behind the self-help book explosion.
'What social theorists call "detraditionalization" - the tendency of advancing capitalism to disrupt the cultures and traditions that may stand in the way of the accumulation of profit' has been seen as underpinning behind the self-help phenomenon in two (overlapping) ways. The first is the eclipse of the informal, communitarian transmission of folkways and folk wisdom: 'the charge that when self-help writers are being simplistic and repetitious, they are also being banal and unoriginal, merely offering their readers platitudes...on behalf of the best parts of folk wisdom', may simply be because they are providing a "formal" conduit for the conveyance of such "home truths" in an increasingly unstructured and anomic world.
The other result of the loss of 'Weber's "traditional behavior...everyday action to which people have become habitually accustomed"' is an increased social pressure for Self-fashioning: 'while one's identity might have been formerly anchored in (and limited by) a community...the self-creating self must create a written narrative of his or her life'. self-help books 'written and read for the purpose of helping people build a personal philosophy' contribute to that end.
The danger may arise however of an overestimation of the possibilities of change, given that 'we do not in any meaningful sense intend or choose our birth, our parents, our bodies, our language, our culture, our thoughts, our dreams, our desires, our death, and so on'. The 'Twelve-step "Traditions"...have fostered a notion of individual self-mastery or self-control as limited...use of the Serenity Prayer encourages individuals to accept what they cannot change, to find courage to change what they can change, and to seek wisdom in discerning the difference'. Self-help books will indeed often acknowledge formally that 'this book does not replace the need for therapy and counselling for troubled relationships or survivors of a dysfunctional family'. In practice however, fueled by competitive advertising, often 'such books hold out to the reader the promise of a virtually "instantaneous" transformation'; and there ensues something of a 'built-in contradiction of the celebratory arc of the self-help book combined with the stubborn realities' of the human world.
The reader may go away disillusioned; or may seek for "the" answer in the next book, so that 'self-help books can become an addiction in and of themselves' - a process that will 'have fostered the belabored self' rather than relieving it. In that perspective, since all self-help books 'have at least one common message. They tell you that you have the power to change yourself...By implication all of these books are saying, if you are in pain, if you are stuck and can't seem to change, it's no one's fault but your own'.
Characteristics.
Self-help books often focus on popular psychology such as romantic relationships, or aspects of the mind and human behavior which believers in self-help feel can be controlled with effort. 
Self-help books typically advertise themselves as being able to increase self-awareness and performance, including satisfaction with one's life. They often say that they can help you achieve this more quickly than with conventional therapies.
Many celebrities have marketed self-help books including Jennifer Love Hewitt, Oprah Winfrey, Elizabeth Taylor, Charlie Fitzmaurice, Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra and Cher. 
Like most books, self-help books can be purchased both offline and online; 'between 1972 and 2000, the numbers of self-help books...increased from 1.1 percent to 2.4 percent of the total number of books in print'.
Fictional analogues.
Stephen Potter's "Upmanship" books are satirical takes on status-seeking under the cloak of sociableness - 'remember, that it is just on such occasions that an appearance of geniality is most important' - cast in advice-book form. A few decades later, with the neoliberal turn, such advice - 'Remember the reality of self-interest' - would be being seriously advocated in the self-help world: in bestsellers like "Swim with the Sharks", all 'kinds of seemingly benign guile are encouraged', on the principle that 'status displays matter: just don't be suckered by them yourself'.
Perhaps the best-known fictional embodiment of the world of the self-help book is Bridget Jones. Taking 'self-help books... a new "form" of religion' - 'a kind of secularised religion - a sort of moral values lite' - she struggles to integrate its often conflicting instructions into a coherent whole. 'She must stop beating herself over the head with "Women Who Love Too Much" and instead think more towards "Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus"...see Richard's behaviour less as a sign that she is co-dependent and loving too much and more in the light of him being like a Martian rubber band'. Even she, however, has the occasional crisis of faith, when she wonders: 'Maybe it helps if you've never read a self-help book in your life'.
In the BookWorld Companion, it is suggested that 'those of you who have tired of the glitzy world of shopping and inappropriate boyfriends in Chicklit, a trip to Dubious Lifestyle Advice might be the next step. An hour in the hallowed halls of invented ills will leave you with at least ten problems you never knew you had, let alone existed'.

Norman Le Brocq

Norman Le Brocq (1922 – 26 November 1996) was a Jersey politician.
Biography.
He participated in the resistance to German occupation in the Second World War, and was one of the founding members of the Jersey Democratic Movement, a communist party, which by the end of the war in 1945 had grown to 18. The JDM helped to provide support, information and sustenance to the slave workers brought by the Germans over to Jersey from Russia. In 1966, Le Brocq and 19 other islanders were awarded gold watches by the Soviet Union as a sign of gratitude for their role in the resistance movement.
He was a campaigner for working class rights in the field of housing and social policy, and the Communist Party’s leading figure in the Islands. After unsuccessful bids for election in the 1960s, he was elected to the States of Jersey in 1966, which was such a remarkable event that it was noted in the British press - "Working man joins the rulers of Jersey" (Observer 18.12.1966). He remained in the States as a Deputy for Saint Helier until his retirement. 
He was president of the Island Development Committee (IDC) and instrumental in bringing in the first Island Plan, which laid out zones for housing and commercial development and green field sites on which development was not permitted. He was also chairman of the Sea Fisheries Advisory Committee, and a Sea Fisheries vessel is named after him. 
Outside of the States, he was a director of the Channel Islands Co-operative Society for 35 years, and its President for 27 of those.
Social Policies.
In "Jersey Looks Forward" (1946), he enumerated the political and social policies towards which he fought, many of which were later adopted by the States of Jersey. These included:

Guillermo O'Donnell

Guillermo A. O'Donnell (1936-2011) was a prominent Argentine political scientist, who spent most of his career working in Argentina and the United States, and who made lasting contributions to theorizing on authoritarianism and democratization, democracy and the state, and the politics of Latin America. His brother, Pacho O'Donnell, is a well-known politician and writer.
Biography.
O'Donnell was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He studied law at the University of Buenos Aires and became a lawyer in 1958, aged 22. He was involved in student politics, and was Secretary and Acting President of the Buenos Aires University Federation (FUBA), part of the Argentine University Federation, in 1954–1955. Later he served as national Vice-Minister of Interior (Political Affairs), in Argentina, in 1963. But he focused mainly on making a living by working as a lawyer and teaching. During these years he taught in the School of Law at the University of Buenos Aires (1958–66) and at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (1966–68)
In 1968 O'Donnell left Argentina to pursue graduate studies in political science at Yale University. He earned his master's degree in political science in 1971, but rather than complete his dissertation and take a job offer from Harvard University, he returned to Buenos Aires. The text he started to work on at Yale was published as "Modernization and Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism" (1973), a book that immediately drew a lot of attention and led to a seminal debate about Latin American politics in David Collier's edited volume, "The New Authoritarianism in Latin America" (1979). But since this text was published, it could not be presented as a dissertation. And thus O'Donnell would not receive his Ph.D in political science from Yale University until he presented a new dissertation and thus was awarded his Ph.D. belatedly, once he was an established scholar and professor, in 1987.
In Argentina, O'Donnell initially taught at the University of El Salvador (1972–75) and was a researcher at the Centro de Investigaciones en Administración Pública (CIAP), at the Torcuato di Tella Institute, between 1971 and 1975. Subsequently, O'Donnell was a founding member of CEDES (Centro de Estudios de Estado y Sociedad), where he worked from 1975 until 1979. During this period, Argentina was increasingly swept by violence, as guerrilla organizations such as the Montoneros sought to undermine the government and eventually the military rulers came to power in 1976 and launched a dirty war. In this climate, CEDES was one of the few research centers where critical thinking about politics thrived. Indeed, in 1978, O'Donnell launched a major research project on democratic transitions in Southern Europe and Latin America that he co-directed with Philippe C. Schmitter and that was sponsored by the Latin American Program of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, in Washington, D.C. The project began with three conferences, in 1979, 1980, and 1981, that gathered many of the world’s most distinguished scholars of democracy, including Robert A. Dahl, Juan Linz, Adam Przeworski, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Albert Otto Hirschman. It would result in a landmark publication: "Transitions from Authoritarian Rule. Prospects for Democracy" (1986).
In late 1979, O'Donnell left Argentina again, this time for Brazil. He worked as a researcher at IUPERJ (Instituto Universitário de Pesquisas do Río de Janeiro) (1980–82) and then moved to the research center CEBRAP (Centro Brasileiro de Análise e Planejamento) in São Paulo in 1982, replacing the sociologist Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who had become a national Senator. But O'Donnell moved again, now from Brazil to the United States, in 1983. Thereafter, though he maintained his affiliation with CEBRAP until 1991, he taught at the University of Notre Dame from 1983 until 2009, where he was Helen Kellogg Professor of Government and International Studies. He was also academic director of the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies of the University of Notre Dame from 1983 until 1997. His twenty-six year association with Notre Dame made this university the most important institutional home of O'Donnell's career.
During his career, O'Donnell played a leadership role in many professional associations. He served as president of the International Political Science Association (IPSA) from 1988 to 1991, and was vice-president of the American Political Science Association (APSA) in 1999–2000. He also held many short term appointment at universities around the world. He was a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1973-74; the Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (FLASCO), in Buenos Aires, in 1978-79; the University of California, Berkeley, in 1982; the Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Ciencias Sociales, at the Instituto Juan March, in Madrid, in 1997; the University of Cambridge, where he was the Simon Bolivar Distinguished Visiting Professor in 2002-03; and the University of Oxford, where he was Senior Visiting Fellow in Politics at Nuffield College in 2003-04 and John G. Winant Visiting Professorship of American Government in 2007-08. He also was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, in Stanford, California, in 2002.
O'Donnell also bridged the worlds of academia and politics. He worked with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) during the 2000s, collaborating with Dante Caputo in the preparation of the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) report "Democracy in Latin America. Toward a Citizens’ Democracy" (2004), O'Donnell also was a member of the Advisory Board of the United Nations Democracy Fund and a member of the scientific committee of Fundación IDEAS, Spain's Socialist Party's think-tank.
O'Donnell returned to his native Buenos Aires in 2009. There he continued to be active on the local academic scene. He joined the Escuela de Política y Gobierno, at the 
National University of General San Martín (Universidad Nacional de San Martín his last professional affiliation. At UNSAM O'Donnell founded the Centro de Investigaciones sobre el Estado y la Democracia en América Latina (CIEDAL), in 2010. In 2011 O'Donnell was struck by cancer and, after a four month battle, he died on November 29, 2011, at the age of 75. A public wake was held in the legislative building of the City of Buenos Aires, and his remains were buried in the Recoleta Cemetery.
Academic research.
O’Donnell was a leading theorist of authoritarianism and democratization and one of the most distinguished Latin American political scientists.
O’Donnell’s "Modernization and Bureaucratic Authoritarianism" (1973) offered a pioneering analysis of the breakdown of democracies in South America in the 1960s. He argued that the form of authoritarianism experienced by South America starting in the 1960s was novel because it was based on modern technocrats and a professionalized military organization, instead of populist politicians or traditional military strongmen. To capture this distinctiveness, he coined the term 'bureaucratic authoritarianism'. O’Donnell argued that this new form of authoritarianism emerged as the result of political conflict generated by an import-substitution model of industrialization. He cast his argument as an alternative to the thesis, advanced most notably by Seymour Martin Lipset, that industrialization produced democracy. In South America, O’Donnell argued, industrialization generated not democracy, but bureaucratic authoritarianism. This work, along with a series of subsequent articles, triggered an important debate in comparative politics and Latin American Studies about the political consequences of economic development. The central contributions to this debate were published in a volume edited by David Collier, "The New Authoritarianism in Latin America" (1979), which assessed and critiqued O’Donnell’s thesis.
The next phase of O’Donnell’s research focused on the demise of authoritarianism and transitions to democracy. His coauthored book with Philippe C. Schmitter, "Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Tentative Conclusions about Uncertain Democracies" (1986), was one of the most widely read and influential works in comparative politics during the 1980s and 1990s. O’Donnell and Schmitter proposed a strategic choice approach to transitions to democracy that highlighted how they were driven by the decisions of different actors in response to a core set of dilemmas. The analysis centered on the interaction among four actors: the hard-liners and soft-liners who belonged to the incumbent authoritarian regime, and the moderate and radical oppositions against the regime. This book not only became the point of reference for a burgeoning academic literature on democratic transitions, it was also read widely by political activists engaged in actual struggles to achieve democracy.
O’Donnell’s research since the early 1990s explored the question of the quality of democracy. His work warns against teleological thinking, that is, the tendency to see countries that democratized in the 1970s and 1980s as following in the tracks, though several steps behind, of the longstanding democratic countries of the West. To highlight the specificity of contemporary Latin American countries and the deficiencies of their democracies, he proposed the concept of delegative democracy, by which he meant a form of democratic rule that concentrated power in the hands of elected presidents, and the associated concept of horizontal accountability. Later work centered on the problems faced by most Latin American democracies as a result of deficiencies in the rule of law and the social capabilities of citizens. His key works on the quality of democracy have been published in "Counterpoints" (1999), "The Quality of Democracy" (2004), "Dissonances" (2007), and in his final book, "Democracy, Agency, and the State" (2010), which makes a case for addressing the importance of the state in conceptualizations of democracy.
Summing up his contributions, one observer states that "O’Donnell decisively shaped the intellectual agenda for the study of the rise of military dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the early 1970s; pioneered the analysis of authoritarian breakdowns and democratic transitions throughout the 1980s; and broke new conceptual ground for efforts to understand the problems of life after transition (including the issue of institutional quality) during the 1990s." Another observer put it more briefly: "Guillermo O’Donnell was the argentine Max Weber."
