Criminal law

Criminal law is the body of law that relates to crime. It regulates social conduct and prescribes threatening, harming, or otherwise endangering the health, safety, and moral welfare of people. It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws. Criminal law differs from civil law, whose emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment.
History.
The first civilizations generally did not distinguish between civil law and criminal law. The first written codes of law were designed by the Sumerians. Around 2100-2050 BC Ur-Nammu, the Neo-Sumerian king of Ur, enacted the oldest written legal code whose text has been discovered: the "Code of Ur-Nammu" although an earlier code of Urukagina of Lagash ( 2380-2360 BC ) is also known to have existed. Another important early code was the Code Hammurabi, which formed the core of Babylonian law. Only fragments of the early criminal laws of Ancient Greece have survived, e.g. those of Solon and Draco.
In Roman law, Gaius's "Commentaries on the Twelve Tables" also conflated the civil and criminal aspects, treating theft ("furtum") as a tort. Assault and violent robbery were analogized to trespass as to property. Breach of such laws created an obligation of law or "vinculum juris" discharged by payment of monetary compensation or damages. The criminal law of imperial Rome is collected in Books 47-48 of the Digest. After the revival of Roman law in the 12th century, sixth-century Roman classifications and jurisprudence provided the foundations of the distinction between criminal and civil law in European law from then until the present time.
The first signs of the modern distinction between crimes and civil matters emerged during the Norman Invasion of England. The special notion of criminal penalty, at least concerning Europe, arose in Spanish Late Scolasticism (see Alfonso de Castro), when the theological notion of God's penalty (poena aeterna) that was inflicted solely for a guilty mind, became transfused into canon law first and, finally, to secular criminal law. The development of the state dispensing justice in a court clearly emerged in the eighteenth century when European countries began maintaining police services. From this point, criminal law had formalized the mechanisms for enforcement, which allowed for its development as a discernible entity.
Objectives of criminal law.
Criminal law is distinctive for the uniquely serious potential consequences or sanctions for failure to abide by its rules. Every crime is composed of criminal elements. Capital punishment may be imposed in some jurisdictions for the most serious crimes. Physical or corporal punishment may be imposed such as whipping or caning, although these punishments are prohibited in much of the world. Individuals may be incarcerated in prison or jail in a variety of conditions depending on the jurisdiction. Confinement may be solitary. Length of incarceration may vary from a day to life. Government supervision may be imposed, including house arrest, and convicts may be required to conform to particularized guidelines as part of a parole or probation regimen. Fines also may be imposed, seizing money or property from a person convicted of a crime.
Five objectives are widely accepted for enforcement of the criminal law by punishments: retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and restoration. Jurisdictions differ on the value to be placed on each.
Selected criminal laws.
Many laws are enforced by threat of criminal punishment, and the range of the punishment varies with the jurisdiction. The scope of criminal law is too vast to catalog intelligently. Nevertheless, the following are some of the more known aspects of the criminal law.
Elements.
The criminal law generally prohibits undesirable "acts". Thus, proof of a crime requires proof of some act. Scholars label this the requirement of an actus reus or "guilty act". Some crimesparticularly modern regulatory offensesrequire no more, and they are known as strict liability offenses (E.g. Under the "Road traffic Act 1988" it is a strict liability offence to drive a vehicle with an alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit). Nevertheless, because of the potentially severe consequences of criminal conviction, judges at common law also sought proof of an "intent" to do some bad thing, the mens rea or "guilty mind". As to crimes of which both "actus reus" and "mens rea" are requirements, judges have concluded that the elements must be present at precisely the same moment and it is not enough that they occurred sequentially at different times.
Actus reus.
"Actus reus" is Latin for "guilty act" and is the physical element of committing a crime. It may be accomplished by an action, by threat of action, or exceptionally, by an omission to act, which is a legal duty to act. For example, the act of "A" striking "B" might suffice, or a parent's failure to give food to a young child also may provide the actus reus for a crime.
Where the actus reus is a "failure" to act, there must be a "duty of care". A duty can arise through contract, a voluntary undertaking, a blood relation with whom one lives, and occasionally through one's official position. Duty also can arise from one's own creation of a dangerous situation. On the other hand, it was held in the U.K. that switching off the life support of someone in a persistent vegetative state is an omission to act and not criminal. Since discontinuation of power is not a voluntary act, not grossly negligent, and is in the patient's best interests, no crime takes place. In this case it was held that since a PVS patient could not give or withhold consent to medical treatment, it was for the doctors to decide whether treatment was in the patient's best interest. It was reasonable for them to conclude that treatment was not in the patient's best interest, and should therefore be stopped, when there was no prospect of improvement. It was never lawful to take active steps to cause or accelerate death, although in certain circumstances it was lawful to withhold life sustaining treatment, including feeding, without which the patient would die.
An actus reus may be nullified by an absence of causation. For example, a crime involves harm to a person, the person's action must be the "but for" cause and "proximate cause" of the harm. If more than one cause exists (e.g. harm comes at the hands of more than one culprit) the act must have "more than a slight or trifling link" to the harm.
Causation is not broken simply because a victim is particularly vulnerable. This is known as the thin skull rule. However, it may be broken by an intervening act ("novus actus interveniens") of a third party, the victim's own conduct, or another unpredictable event. A mistake in medical treatment typically will not sever the chain, unless the mistakes are in themselves "so potent in causing death."
Mens rea.
"Mens rea" is another Latin phrase, meaning "guilty mind". This is the mental element of the crime. A guilty mind means an intention to commit some wrongful act. Intention under criminal law is separate from a person's motive (although motive does not exist in Scots law).
A lower threshold of "mens rea" is satisfied when a defendant recognises an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental state of mind of the person at the time the actus reus was committed. For instance, if "C" tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognised a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one "ought" to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing "intent" as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.
Wrongfulness of intent also may vary the seriousness of an offense and possibly reduce the punishment but this is not always the case. A killing committed with specific intent to kill or with conscious recognition that death or serious bodily harm will result, would be murder, whereas a killing effected by reckless acts lacking such a consciousness could be manslaughter. On the other hand, it matters not who is actually harmed through a defendant's actions. The doctrine of transferred malice means, for instance, that if a man intends to strike a person with his belt, but the belt bounces off and hits another, mens rea is transferred from the intended target to the person who actually was struck.The notion of transferred intent does not exist within Scots' Law. In Scotland, one would not be charged with assault due to transferred intent, but instead assault due to recklessness. 
Strict liability.
Strict liability can be described as criminal or civil liability notwithstanding the lack mens rea or intent by the defendant. Not all crimes require specific intent, and the threshold of culpability required may be reduced. For example, it might be sufficient to show that a defendant acted negligently, rather than intentionally or recklessly. In offenses of absolute liability, other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show the act was intentional. Generally, crimes must include an intentional act, and "intent" is an element that must be proved in order to find a crime occurred. The idea of a "strict liability crime" is an oxymoron. The few exceptions are not truly crimes at all – but are administrative regulations and civil penalties created by statute, such as crimes against the traffic or highway code.
Fatal offenses.
A "murder", defined broadly, is an unlawful killing. Unlawful killing is probably the act most frequently targeted by the criminal law. In many jurisdictions, the crime of murder is divided into various gradations of severity, e.g., murder in the "first degree", based on "intent". "Malice" is a required element of murder. Manslaughter (Culpable Homicide in Scotland) is a lesser variety of killing committed in the absence of "malice", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. "Involuntary" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.
Settled insanity is a possible defense.
Personal offenses.
Many criminal codes protect the physical integrity of the body. The crime of battery is traditionally understood as an unlawful touching, although this does not include everyday knocks and jolts to which people silently consent as the result of presence in a crowd. Creating a fear of imminent battery is an assault, and also may give rise to criminal liability. Non-consensual intercourse, or rape, is a particularly egregious form of battery.
Property offenses.
Property often is protected by the criminal law. Trespassing is unlawful entry onto the real property of another. Many criminal codes provide penalties for conversion, embezzlement, theft, all of which involve deprivations of the value of the property. Robbery is a theft by force. Fraud in the UK is a breach of the Fraud Act 2006 by false representation, by failure to disclose information or by abuse of position.
Participatory offenses.
Some criminal codes criminalize association with a criminal venture or involvement in criminality that does not actually come to fruition. Some examples are aiding, abetting, conspiracy, and attempt. However, in Scotland, the English concept of Aiding and Abetting is known as Art and Part Liability. See Glanville Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law, (London: Stevens & Sons, 1983); Glanville Williams, Criminal Law the General Part (London: Stevens & Sons, 1961).
Mala in se v. mala prohibita.
While crimes are typically broken into degrees or classes to punish appropriately, all offenses can be divided into 'mala in se' and 'mala prohibita' laws. Both are Latin legal terms, mala in se meaning crimes that are thought to be inherently evil or morally wrong, and thus will be widely regarded as crimes regardless of jurisdiction. Mala in se offenses are felonies, property crimes, immoral acts and corrupt acts by public officials. Mala prohibita, on the other hand, refers to offenses that do not have wrongfulness associated with them. Parking in a restricted area, driving the wrong way down a one-way street, jaywalking or unlicensed fishing are examples of acts that are prohibited by statute, but without which are not considered wrong. Mala prohibita statutes are usually imposed strictly, as there does not need to be mens rea component for punishment under those offenses, just the act itself. For this reason, it can be argued that offenses that are mala prohibita are not really crimes at all.
Criminal law jurisdictions.
Public international law deals extensively and increasingly with criminal conduct that is heinous and ghastly enough to affect entire societies and regions. The formative source of modern international criminal law was the Nuremberg trials following the Second World War in which the leaders of Nazism were prosecuted for their part in genocide and atrocities across Europe. The Nuremberg trials marked the beginning of criminal fault for individuals, where individuals acting on behalf of a government can be tried for violations of international law without the benefit of sovereign immunity. In 1998 an International criminal court was established in the Rome Statute.

Blind (band)

Blind were a Christian rock band formed in Wollongong, Australia in 1999 and consisted of Greg Bell (guitar), Adrian Deck (drums/vocals), Andrew Nicholls (vocals 2001–2005), Michael Molkentin (bass) and Chris Stewart (vocals 1999–2000).
Blind, 1999–2005.
The band, formed by former members of Wollongong rock and funk bands '"Apartment"' (Deck) and '"Funkin' Unreal"' (Bell, Molkentin) in 1999, released their first self-recorded EP early the following year. Their music, consisting of a pop/funk feel, was not outwardly overtly Christian in nature, but instead focused more on themes of their faith that often touched on secular ideas. After building up a loyal fan base in Sydney and Illawarra areas, Chris announced his leaving the band.
With Andrew Nicholls taking over vocal duties in 2001, Blind recorded their first full-length album, '"Long Walk Home"'. This album was released under the Down Under Christian Music Group labels and saw the band gain radio play on local commercial stations. In late 2001 the song '"Divinely Beautiful"' was featured on the various artists CD '"Down Under 2002: Australasia's 35 Hottest Christian Artists"', and the band began intensive summer touring that would see them regular visitors to towns and cities along Australia's eastern coast.
The 2002 album '"Echoes"' saw the band sign with and work with noted producer Caleb James, as well as gain limited airplay on Australian national youth-oriented radio station Triple J. Blind's work with James continued with the critically acclaimed 2003 album '"October Observations"'. The band, now a major Christian act within Australia, made major billing for a number of music festivals throughout 2003 and 2004 in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, including the Black Stump Music and Arts Festival on the outskirts of Sydney. The band broke up in 2005 to allow band members to pursue other projects. Bell started another band 'The Dawn Collective', which Molkentin played bass in until late 2006. Nicholls, Molkentin and Deck are currently members of the experimental group "Spurs".

Evansville Purple Aces men's basketball

The Evansville Purple Aces men's basketball team represents the Purple Aces of the University of Evansville, located in Evansville, Indiana, in NCAA Division I basketball competition. They are currently led by head coach Marty Simmons and play their home games at the Ford Center. Evansville's athletics teams were originally known as the Pioneers in the early part of the 1900s. In the 1920s, the name Aces arose after a local sports writer wrote in a game story of the men's basketball team, "They played like Aces." The team has been known as the Aces and/or Purple Aces ever since. Evansville has won five Division II national championships (1959, 1960, 1964, 1965, 1971).
History.
In the early years of the men's basketball program the Purple Aces appeared in the NAIA national tournament. The Purple Aces appeared 4 times in the NAIA Tournament (1941, 1942, 1951, and 1955). The Purple Aces had a NAIA tournament record of 3-4. The furthest Evansville got in the NAIA tournaments was in third round (NAIA Quarterfinals) in 1951, only to lose to Regis University (Colo.) 70-68. 
Shortly after the 1955 season the Purple Aces would move up to the NCAA College Division, now called NCAA Division II. The Evansville Purple Aces rank second all-time in NCAA College Division national championships with five: 1959, 1960, 1964, 1965 (29-0 record) and 1971. The 1964 and 1965 teams starred NBA Legend Jerry Sloan, the 1971 team featured future NBA star Don Buse and former NCAA referee Steve Welmer.
In 1977, UE began playing in NCAA Division I athletics. That same year on December 13, a chartered DC-3 carrying the entire UE basketball team crashed in a field near the Evansville Regional Airport en route to a game against Middle Tennessee State. Every member of the team and coaching staff on the plane was killed. One player was not able to attend the game and thus was not on the plane; not long after the plane crash, however, the player who was not on the plane was killed in a car accident along with his younger brother. 
Tremendous community support brought back the basketball program the next year. Evansville was a charter member of the Midwest Collegiate Conference, now known as the Horizon League. The Aces won or shared the MCC regular season title in 1982, 1987, 1989, 1992, and 1993. They also won the conference tournament title in 1982, 1992, and 1993. The Aces are now a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, and won the 1999 regular season title. 
Legendary Aces coach Arad McCutchan was the first NCAA College Division coach selected to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.
The Purple Aces have made five trips to the NCAA Men's basketball tournament (1982, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1999) and two trips to the NIT (1998, 1994).

Bruce Kraus

Bruce A. Kraus (born April 13, 1954) is an American politician and businessman from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He has served since January 2008 on Pittsburgh City Council, of which he is currently President, representing the 3rd district neighborhoods of South Side Flats, South Side Slopes, Beltzhoover, Knoxville, Arlington, Arlington Heights, Allentown, Mount Oliver, Central Oakland and Mount Washington.
Career history.
Councilman Bruce A. Kraus, born and raised in the South Side, began serving as a member of Pittsburgh City Council upon his swearing in on January 7, 2008. Bruce proudly represents Pittsburgh’s 3rd Council District while rounding out his duties as City Council President. District 3 comprises the following neighborhoods: Allentown, Arlington, Arlington Heights, Beltzhoover, Central Oakland, Knoxville, Mt. Oliver, South Oakland, South Side Flats, South Side Slopes, and Mt. Washington. Bruce was reelected to his seat in 2011 and sworn in for a second term on January 3, 2012. In January of 2014, Bruce was elected by his colleagues as the President of Pittsburgh City Council.
As a Councilman, Bruce has also sponsored a diverse and comprehensive package of legislation over the years. In response to concerns of his constituents, Councilman Kraus introduced the Responsible Hospitality Institute’s Sociable City Plan, which has worked to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve night life throughout Pittsburgh with an emphasis on public safety and transportation. He has also designed stricter open-container laws and passed the first municipal ban on public urination. Additionally, he sponsored the city’s Social Host Ordinance, tightening measures to prevent underage parties and protect students and residents from unsafe conditions often created by these parties.
Councilman Kraus’s personal history and extensive relationship with his constituents have played a key role in influencing a great deal of his work in local government. As Pittsburgh’s first openly gay elected official, Bruce has been a strong proponent of key civil rights issues including the Allegheny County Human Relations Commission – which serves to combat discrimination in housing, public accommodation, and employment – and the city’s first uniform Domestic Partner Registry.
In his years on City Council, Bruce Kraus has supported many projects in collaboration with local government offices, various city departments, and neighborhood groups throughout District 3. Bruce helped to lead the conversion of a once blighted South Side property into the Riverfront Off-Leash Exercise Area, a dog park serving South Pittsburgh residents. He also collaborated with Public Works in reopening the South Side Market House which is the largest senior program center in the city. Bruce assisted in securing funding and support for the $4 million renovation of the Carson Street branch of the Carnegie Library to better serve the surrounding community with state of the art library services.
Councilman Kraus is committed to the revival of the historic and traditional beauty of the many neighborhoods in Pittsburgh’s Hilltop Community. He is actively working towards improvements in recycling and waste management and the elimination of abandoned cars and derelict buildings throughout the district.
In service to these communities, Bruce has collaborated with the City and the Port Authority in overseeing the complete reconstruction of East Warrington Avenue through Allentown and Beltzhoover to create a safe and usable street vital to the health and well-being of these neighborhoods. He has also collaborated with Citiparks and community leaders in bringing a spray park to the Warrington Recreation Center set to open in spring of 2014.
Councilman Kraus worked to secure space and open the Carnegie “Pop-Up Library” in Allentown to provide library access to the surrounding residents.

The Hunters (1957 film)

The Hunters is a 1957 ethnographic film that documents the efforts of four !Kung men (also known as Ju/'hoansi or Bushmen) to hunt a giraffe in the Kalahari Desert of Namibia. The footage was shot by John Marshall during a Smithsonian-Harvard Peabody sponsored expedition in 1952–53. In addition to the giraffe hunt, the film shows other aspects of !Kung life at that time, including family relationships, socializing and storytelling, and the hard work of gathering plant foods and hunting for small game.
The film was produced at the Film Study Center of the Peabody Museum at Harvard University by John Marshall in collaboration with Robert Gardner. It won the Robert J. Flaherty Award for best one-off documentary from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1958, and was named to the National Film Registry by the Librarian of Congress in 2003 for its "cultural, aesthetic, or historical significance". "The Hunters" was preserved in 2000 with a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation.

Georgia–Poland relations refers to foreign relations between Georgia and Poland. Both countries established diplomatic relation on 28 April 1992. Georgia has an embassy in Warsaw. Poland has an embassy in Tbilisi.
Both countries are full members of the Council of Europe.
The documented ties between Georgia and Poland reach back to the 15th century, when the Georgian (Kartlian) King Konstantin sent a diplomatic mission to the Polish King Alexander Jagiellon. Later, Polish King Jan III Sobieski tried to establish contacts with Georgia. Many Georgians participated in military campaigns led by Poland in 17th century. Bogdan Gurdziecki, a Georgian, who was the greatest authority on all things Persian working in the Polish king's diplomatic service, made frequent diplomatic trips to Persia, on which he obtained, among other things, guarantees upholding earlier privileges for missionaries. Already during the rule of King Jan Kazimierz, he sent on missions to Isfahan, and King Jan III Sobieski availed himself of Gurdziecki's talents in like manner (in 1668, 1671, 1676–1678, in 1682–1684, and in 1687). Gurdziecki remained at the court of the shah for several years in the capacity of special resident and representative of the Polish king; it was he who delivered to the shah Suleiman news about the victory of the Christian forces at Vienna (1683).
During the brief period of Georgian independence in 1920, Poland and Georgia had established good relations and signed a short-lived alliance.
During the War in South Ossetia in 2008, Poland strongly supported Georgia. The President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński, flew to Tbilisi along with other Eastern European presidents to rally against the Russian military buildup and subsequent military conflict.
After several attacks on the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, the Polish president allowed the Georgian MFA to publish its messages on his website.

<doc id="21351751" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21351751" title="Italianization of South Tyrol">
Italianization of South Tyrol

In 1919, at the time of its annexation, the southern part of the County of Tyrol which is today called South Tyrol (in Italian "Alto Adige") was inhabited by almost 90% German speakers. Under the 1939 South Tyrol Option Agreement, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini determined the status of the German people living in the province. They could emigrate to Germany or the Greater German Reich's territory in the Crimea, or stay in Italy and accept their complete Italianization. As a consequence of this, the society of South Tyrol was deeply riven. Those who wanted to stay, the so-called "Dableiber", were condemned as traitors while those who left ("Optanten") were defamed as Nazis. Because of the outbreak of World War II, this agreement was never fully implemented. Illegal Katakombenschulen ("Catacomb schools") were set up to teach children the German language.
Italianization programme.
Fascist period (1922-1945).
In 1923, three years after South Tyrol had been formally annexed, Italian place names, almost entirely based on the "Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige", were made official by means of a decree. The German name "Tyrol" was banned, likewise its derivants and compound words such as "Tyrolean" and "South Tyrolean". German newspapers, publishing houses, organized clubs and associations, including the South Tyrolean Alpine Club had to be renamed, with the decree said to have been strictly enforced by Italian "carabinieri" on the ground. The basis for these actions was a manifesto published by Ettore Tolomei on July 15, 1923, called the "Provvedimenti per l'Alto Adige" ("Measures for the Alto Adige"), becoming the blueprint for the Italianization campaign. Its 32 measures were:
In October 1923, the "use of the Italian language became mandatory on all levels of federal, provincial and local government". Regulations by the fascist authorities required that all kinds of signs and public notices had to be in Italian only, while maps, postcards and other graphic material had to show Italian place names. In September 1925, Italian became the sole permissible language in courts of law, meaning that cases could be heard from now on only in Italian. The fascist law regulations remained in effect after World War II, becoming a bone of contention for decades until they were eventually reconsidered in the 1990s. 
The German-language press, which was still published, was harassed by the authorities and subjected to censorship prior to publication. In 1926 the fascist authorities began to publish their own German-language newspaper, the "Alpenzeitung". Other German-language papers were obliged to follow a strictly pro-regime editorial policy. 
The programme of Italianization was particularly forcefully applied in schools, aiming at the destruction of the German school system. As of 1928, Italian had become the only language of instruction in 760 South Tyrolean classes, affecting over 360 schools and 30,000 pupils. Likewise, German Kindergarten were required to use Italian, while substitutes were forced to shut down. German teachers were systematically dismissed on the grounds of "insufficient didactics", or transferred to the south, from where Italian teachers were recruited instead. Degrees from Austrian or German universities became valid only through an additional stay of one year at an Italian university. 
In religious affairs, a royal decree of November 1923 required religious instruction in Italian for all Italianized schools. Fascist calls for the Italianization of German charitable organizations, religious orders and the complete abolition of German religious instruction to the Vatican were not entirely successful, not in the least due to the repeated interventions of the Bishop of Brixen and the setting up of informal Parish schools. In state schools, though, Italian became mandatory for the last five classes, while the use of German was only allowed in teaching the Italian catechism in the first three years. 
The German-speaking population reacted by the establishment of Katakombenschulen ("catacomb schools"), clandestine home schools outside the Italianized standard educational system. German schoolbooks were secretly smuggled across the border, often hidden in religious buildings before distributed to the South Tyroleans pupils. After initial difficulties, secret seminars for the instruction of teachers were organized throughout the province, usually under the protection of the Catholic church. Fascist countermeasures ranged from searches and confiscations to imprisonments and deportations. The balancing act between the instruction in Italian and German schools, where often the exact opposite was taught, especially in history and the social fields, is said to have left many Tyrolean pupils with a torn identity. The newly composed "Bozner Bergsteigerlied" quickly became one of South Tyrol's unofficial hymns by celebrating an unbroken attachment of the South Tyroleans to their homeland.
Post-war period.
After the end of the Second World War, reform processes tolerated the dual use of names on street signs, while the Italian names remain as the official ones, based on the 1940 law.
In the 1990s, a commission consisting of the Professors Josef Breu (Vienna, representing Austria in the Toponymy commission of the UN), Peter Glatthard (Berne) and Carlo Alberto Mastrelli (Florence, current "Archivio per l'Alto Adige") failed as Mastrelli insisted on the fascist decrees, while Breu and Glatthard promoted the UN-Guidelines.

Idridgehay railway station is an intermediate station on the former Midland Railway branch line to the town of Wirksworth in Derbyshire. The line is off the Midland Main Line at . The line has been reopened as the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway and Idridgehay station was reopened on 8 March 2008. It has the national station code of XID.
History.
Opened with other stations on the branch line to Wirksworth on 1 October 1867, Idridgehay remained open until 16 June 1947 when the Wirksworth branch passenger service was withdrawn on a temporary basis in response to postwar fuel shortages. This was made permanent with effect from May 1949 when the line was removed from the summer timetable. Freight facilities remained rail-served until 2 March 1964, while the branch continued to be used for mineral traffic until December 1989.
The station has been restored as an operational station on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway in Derbyshire. The station building and nearby former station master's house have been sold off to private ownership in recent years but the platform has been restored by volunteer members of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway Association culminating in its re-opening to passenger carrying trains in March 2008. The rebuilding of the adjacent level crossing with new gates and fencing was completed over the winter of 2007/8.

Virtuous Leadership

Alexandre Havard’s Virtuous Leadership sets forth a leadership model to help professional people grow in virtue and lead effectively. Virtuous Leadership has been translated into 15 languages including Russian and Chinese. As such, some commentators have called it the first systematic and holistic attempt to relate the classical virtues to professional leadership in modern times. 
Havard’s leadership model is rooted in aretology—the science of virtue. Derived from the Greek word for virtue—arête—this branch of science stems from the work of the classical Greek philosophers—above all, Aristotle—and was developed further by such Christian philosophers and theologians as Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas.

Romania–Saudi Arabia relations

Romania–Saudi Arabia relations are foreign, economic and cultural relations between Romania and Saudi Arabia. Romania has an embassy in Riyadh and an honorary consulate in Jeddah. Saudi Arabia has an embassy in Bucharest.
Official exchanges.
Since the Romanian revolution of 1989, the two countries have routinely engaged in friendly diplomatic exchanges. In October 1999, Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile received a delegation of the Majlis-ash-Shura (Consultative Council) of Saudi Arabia, headed by its chairman, Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Uthman bin Jubayr. Jubayr proposed development of an agreement for trade, economic, technical, cultural and sports cooperation, particularly cooperation in the oil sector.
In March 2000, Romania's Foreign Affairs State Secretary Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu met with Saudi Arabia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Bin Obaid Madani. Madani told reporters after the meeting that the main goal of his visit was to search for ways of diversifying and consolidating the Saudi-Romanian ties. In April 2000, King Fahd Bin Abd-al-Aziz met with Romania's deputy premier and foreign minister Petre Roman. Petre Roman also met with his counterpart Sa'ud al-Faysal and Crown Prince Abdullah, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council. They discussed development of greater economic cooperations between the countries. In May 2000, the president of the Romanian Senate, Mircea Ionescu Quintus visited Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the chairman of the Saudi Consultative Council, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Ibrahim al-Jubayr.
In March 2003, Chairman of the Romanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry George Cojocaru and vice-chairman of Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry Abdul Aziz al-Athel signed a memorandum on the setting up of the bilateral Romanian-Saudi Economic Council.
Since 2006, relationships have become closer, with more tangible progress on trade and investment. In November 2006, Dr. Hashim Abdullah Yamani, minister of commerce & industry of Saudi Arabia, visited Bucharest, where a broader framework of economic cooperation was discussed. At the meeting, the Romanian vice Premier Bogdan Pascu said the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important economic partner and Romania is interested in developing the economic contacts existing between the two states. Also in November, Romanian Dr. Ion Dobreci presented his credentials to Prince Saud Al-Faisal, foreign minister, in Riyadh. He said Bucharest seeks to boost economic, technical, scientific and cultural cooperation with Saudi Arabia, and is examining the possibility of cooperation in oil & petrochemical sector. A Romanian economic mission was to visit Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in November 2007, meeting with the chambers of commerce and industry in Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam and Bahrain.
Trade and investment.
As of 2005, total Saudi-Romanian trade was relatively low, in the region of US$200 million per year. Although an oil producer, Romania imports oil from Saudi Arabia. Exports from Romania to Saudi Arabia include steel and aluminum products used in the oil industry.
In May 2007, the Romanian ambassador to Saudi Arabia said that Saudi investors had made total investments of US$2.2 billion in Romania to date. For example, in 2001 it was reported that the Amiantit group of Saudi Arabia planned to invest at least 54M euro in existing pipe production units in Romania, and that the value of the group's production in Romania would rise to 109M euro a year. Another example was the 2007 acquisition of a controlling stake in Romania's state-owned Electroputere by a subsidiary of the Saudi Mada Group, which bought the controlling stake in the Romanian manufacturer of train engines, generators and electrical transformers for $174 million, and intends to invest $1 billion to modernize the company. Mada is involved in major railway project in Saudi Arabia, and plans to use the company's engines. The Electroputere deal was finalized in November 2007. Also in 2007, the Saudi Zamil Group was looking into investment in Romania's steel and pipe projects, and a major housing project of 25,000 units in Romania was being developed by a Saudi-Romanian joint venture. In 2008, Saudi Oger bought the Romanian cellular service provider Telemobil (Zapp). A significant number of Romanian workers, particularly engineers, are employed in the oil and construction industries in Saudi Arabia.

Ross v H.M. Advocate

HM Advocate v Ross was a 1991 Scots criminal law case decided by the High Court of Justiciary. The defendant had been charged with violently attacking others in a public house, but was allowed to go free on the premise that he was in a state of non-self-induced automatism. Others in the bar had slipped LSD and other drugs into his beer without him knowing, and there was only a small amount of alcohol he had been drinking so he was not responsible for his intoxication which led to the violent actions.
This case set a key precedent in Scots law for automatism, namely that since this case, if someone has been under the effect of drugs that they themselves did not voluntarily know they were taking or were under the influence of and commit a violent act, it may be a defence for them in court if they can prove or give evidence that their intoxication was not self-induced.
Later cases suggested that the Scottish precedent established in "Ross" would be followed in England as well.

<doc id="21351987" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21351987" title="Asterius of Amasea">
Asterius of Amasea

Saint Asterius of Amasea (c. 350 – c. 410 AD) was made Bishop of Amasea between 380 and 390 AD, after having been a lawyer. He was born in Cappadocia and probably died in Amasea in modern Turkey, then in Pontus. Significant portions of his lively sermons survive, which are especially interesting from the point of view of art history, and social life in his day. Asterius, Bishop of Amasea is not to be confused with the Arian polemicist, Asterius the Sophist.
Life and work.
Asterius of Amasea was the younger contemporary of Amphilochius of Iconium and the three great Cappadocian Fathers. Little is known about his life, except that he was educated by a Scythian slave. Like Amphilochius, he had been a lawyer before becoming bishop between 380 and 390 AD, and he brought the skills of the professional rhetorician to his sermons. Sixteen homilies and panegyrics on the martyrs still exist, showing familiarity with the classics, and containing an unusual concentration of details of everyday life in his time. One of them, "Oration 4: Adversus Kalendarum Festum" attacks the pagan customs and abuses of the New Years feast, denying everything that Libanius had said supporting it - see Lord of Misrule for extensive quotations. That sermon was preached on January 1, 400 AD, which provides the main evidence, with a reference in another to his great age, to the dating of his career.
Artistic references.
In "Oration 11, On the martyrdom of St. Euphemia", Asterius describes a painting of the martyrdom and compares it to pictures made by the famous pre-Christian Hellenistic painters Euphranor and Timomachus; the speech was quoted twice in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which concluded the period of Byzantine iconoclasm, as evidence in favour of the veneration of images. As described, the icon was on canvas, and displayed in a church near her tomb; it has puzzled historians, as the manner of death, from fire, differs from all other accounts in the tradition. It is an exceptionally detailed "ekphrasis", or description of a work of art, from this period, although scholars have wondered how well the description matched an actual work. The intended audience is uncertain, though it was apparently all-male, as they are addressed as "gentlemen" ("andres"). In Oration 1, "On the The Rich Man and Lazarus", he objects to richly decorated clothes: through vain devices and vicious desires, you seek out fine linen, and gather the threads of the Persian worms and weave the spider's airy web; and going to the dyer, pay large prices in order that he may fish the shell-fish out of the sea and stain the garment with the blood of the creature, ----this is the act of a man surfeited, who misuses his substance, having no place to pour out the superfluity of his wealth. For this in the Gospel such a man is scourged, being portrayed as stupid and womanish, adorning himself with the embellishments of wretched girls.
Clothes decorated with religious images, worn by laymen it seems, are also condemned:having found some idle and extravagant style of weaving, which by the twining of the warp and the woof, produces the effect of a picture, and imprints upon their robes the forms of all creatures, they artfully produce, both for themselves and for their wives and children, clothing beflowered and wrought with ten thousand objects...You may see the wedding of Galilee, and the water-pots; the paralytic carrying his bed on his shoulders; the blind man being healed with the clay; the woman with the bloody issue, taking hold of the border of the garment; the sinful woman falling at the feet of Jesus; Lazarus returning to life from the grave. In doing this they consider that they are acting piously and are clad in garments pleasing to God. But if they take my advice let them sell those clothes and honor the living image of God. Do not picture Christ on your garments. It is enough that he once suffered the humiliation of dwelling in a human body which of his own accord he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon your robes but upon your soul carry about his image.
Other interesting details of the lifestyle of the rich are mentioned in condemnation. The apparent contradiction of these positions confused Arnold Hauser, in his famous "The Social History of Art", into wrongly claiming Asterius as an Iconoclast, but his objection to images on clothes is on the grounds of expense and frivolity.
Texts.
An English translation exists of five sermons by Asterius, which were published in 1904 in the US under the title ""Ancient Sermons for Modern Times"", and issued as a reprint in 2007. This is the main portion of his works to exist in English, and has been transcribed online. Oration 11 has also been translated.
Other sermons by Asterius of Amasea existed in the time of Photius, who referred to a further ten sermons not now known in Bibliotheca codex 271. One of these lost sermons indicates that Asterius lived to a great age.
Fourteen genuine sermons have been printed by Migne in the "Patrologia Graeca" 40, 155-480, with a Latin translation. along with other sermons "by Asterius" that were written by Asterius the Sophist. Another two genuine sermons were discovered in manuscript at Mount Athos by M. Bauer. Those two were first printed by A. Bretz (TU 40.1, 1914). Eleven sermons have also been translated into German.

Arboretum de l'École du Breuil

The Arboretum de l'École du Breuil (12 hectares) is a municipal arboretum located on the Route de la Ferme in the southeast corner of the Bois de Vincennes, Paris, France. It now forms part of the Jardin botanique de la Ville de Paris.
The École du Breuil (25 hectares) was created in 1867 by Baron Haussmann as the city's school of horticulture and arboriculture, and named for Alphonse Du Breuil, professor at the "Conservatoire national des Arts et Métiers", who taught arboriculture from 1867-1887. It was originally located on 4 hectares in Saint-Mandé near today's Palais de la Porte Dorée but in 1936 transferred to its current location. 
Today the arboretum contains about 2000 trees, representing 112 genera, 485 species, and 400 cultivars and varieties (885 taxa), as well as several collections of shrubs representing about 1,000 taxa. Of particular interest are its collections of heritage apple and pear trees (about 400 varieties), and its excellent lilac collection (about 300 varieties) which has been recognized by the "Conservatoire des Collections Végétales Spécialisées" (CCVS).

Romania–Uzbekistan relations

Romania–Uzbekistan relations are foreign relations between Romania and Uzbekistan. Romania recognized Uzbekistan’s independence on December 20, 1991. Both countries established diplomatic relations on October 6, 1995. Romania has an embassy in Tashkent, although Uzbekistan does not have any representation in Romania. Romania sees Uzbekistan as a potentially important partner in Central Asia, where it is trying to increase its standing, while Uzbekistan hopes to receive increased access to technology and European markets via Romania.
Refugees.
After the Andijan massacre in Uzbekistan, 439 Uzbek refugees fleeing the violence were fled Uzbekistan into Kyrgyzstan. The Uzbek government claimed that leaders of the insurrection were among the refugees and demanded their repatriation, but the UNHCR decided that the refugees would instead be sent to a third country. The Romanian government agreed to take the refugees including fourteen considered by the Uzbek authorities to have been leaders in the uprising. By July 2006, nearly all of the Uzbek refugees had been resettled in other countries.
Visits.
In November 2008, Lazăr Comănescu, the Romanian foreign minister, visited Uzbekistan and met with top officials including Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyayev. The visit focused on expanding economic and commercial ties between the two countries. Comanescu also raised the idea of inter-parliamentary relations between the two countries. The Romanians also agreed to assist Uzbekistan with technology related to oil and gas exploitation, and help develop a market in Europe for Uzbek goods. During the visit, Comănescu "hailed the Uzbek authorities' initiatives to strengthen civil society and human rights" and also discussed measures for stabilizing the situation in Central Asia.

Out of an Old Man's Head

"Out of an Old Man's Head" () is a 1968 Swedish film directed by Per Åhlin and Tage Danielsson, starring Hans Alfredson as an old man remembering his past. Partly a black comedy, the film was released around the same time as the urban renewal of the Klara quarters in Stockholm, and could be seen as a comment both on the demolishing of the old buildings and on the welfare state in general.
Out of the total running time of 77 minutes, about 50 minutes are animated. It is considered to be the first Swedish animated feature film, although the first one that was fully animated was Agaton Sax and the Bykoebing Village Festival.
Plot.
On the way home to the run-down shack he lives in with a can of dog food meant for himself, Johan Björk is accidentally covered by a pile of car tires thrown by a man who fails to notice him. His cries for help aren't perceived by anyone except one drunk, who is caught by the police when calling for assistance. Finally, at night, a young couple making love on the pile of tires notice him. They help him to get up and assist him to his home. He is hurt in the leg and understands that he can't take care of himself anymore, so he is put in a retirement home.
At the home, Johan is sitting in a wheelchair staring out the window, mumbling for himself about his past to an animated flashback. Johan grew up on the countryside, when the grass was always green. His father was strong, his mother liked to bake. He was also harassed by a boy named Evert, while at the same time being in love with Evert's cute sister. At his confirmation, Evert tackled him so that all the girls' dresses were ruined by the sacramental wine. This made Evert's sister laugh at him, and with his heart broken he decided to run away to Stockholm.
Johan started to work as a masonry, and carried bricks and bottles of beer to a foreman who consumed one bottle for ever brick he laid. In his loneliness, Johan fantasized about women, and made his first rousing visit to a brothel. He grew a moustache and visited an amusement park with two friends he had made, Sven and a man from Värmland who he has a hard time remembering the name of. They flirted with girls, and everybody laughed when Johan failed at kicking a can in order to camouflage a fart.
A nurse brings Johan back to reality to give him his medicine. Johan fantasizes about constructing a pyramid scheme that will give him thousands of whiskey bottles. He imagines a life of luxury in Monte Carlo, where he is also being chased by gangsters.
Once again Johan goes back to thinking about his past. He is struck by death angst while thinking of his dead parents. Johan also receives a letter from his son who ran away to America many years ago, since Johan wasn't a particularly successful father. The son is asking for money, while Johan is imagining what the American things mentioned in the letter might look like.
Johan is thinking about the modern day. The blocks he was involved in building are being demolished to give room for modernistic city planning. He summarizes his failed life for himself: poverty ruined his relationship, his son ran away and the wife died. He befriends Sven, another man at the retirement home, and together they drink to make the memories fade.
Production.
The live-action scenes were shot on Södermalm, Stockholm and at the retirement home Lundahemmet in Solna Municipality with many of the residents performing as themselves. The film was animated in Malmö from April 1967 to 5 October 1968 by Åhlin and four other animators.
Release.
Released on 6 December 1968, the film was a success and made 1,270,971 SEK during the theatrical run in Sweden. It is yet to be released on home media.

In 1964, the two countries signed their first trade agreement despite having no formal diplomatic relations.
Cultural relations.
A monument jointly dedicated to national poets of Romania and Pakistan, Mihai Eminescu and Allama Iqbal was erected in Islamabad, Pakistan on 15 January 2004, commemorating strong Pakistani-Romanian ties, as well as the "Dialogue Between Civilizations" which is possible through the cross-cultural appreciation of their poetic legacies. On 15 January 2004, Ambassador of Romania, Prof. Dr. Emil Ghitulescu, initiated the construction of the monument in order to "pay a tribute to them and bring a new bond of friendship between Romania and Pakistan." The Monument represents a combination of some of the specific characteristics of Romanian and Pakistani architecture.
The Romanian pop musical band "Akcent" enjoys widespread popularity in Pakistan, with most of its "active fans" on Facebook being Pakistanis. In December 2010, the band visited Pakistan to perform concerts; while answering a question in an interview with a local newspaper as to why the band chose to visit Pakistan, the members remarked "With Pakistan we have a special relationship since our leaders also have close alliances. Pakistan is like a second home to us. It is a country where people really know how to enjoy themselves and have great food."
Recent Agreements.
In 2004 President Ion Iliescu met with Pakistani Interior Minister Markhdoom Syed Saleh Faisal Hayat at Cotroceni Palace, and discussed "the good cooperation between the Romanian Ministry of the Interior and the Pakistani Interior Ministry". Several agreements were signed to combate drug trafficking, and illegal immigration.

History.
Philippine-Romanian relations started when Nicolae Ceaușescu visited Manila as the first socialist leader to enter the Philippines last April 12, 1975, followed by creating a committee for joint Philippine-Romanian Scientific and Technological Commission headed by Dr. Melecio S. Magno and then Ambassador to Romania Leticia Ramos-Shahani. During that time, the Philippines opened relationships with the socialist countries as part of mutual coexistence prevailing during the Martial Law regime of Ferdinand Marcos, breaking the anti-communist atmosphere prevailing before the administration.
In 1994, The Philippine–Romania Business Council, Inc. (PRBC) was organized as an offshoot of the first Philippine trade mission to Romania by the former Undersecretary Tomas Alcantara of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).
In 2002 Romania and the Philippines supported each other's bid for a non-permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. In 2003, the Philippines and Romania agreed to explore areas for cooperation in trade complementation.

St Peter's Church, Devizes

St Peter's Church is one of four Anglican churches in Devizes, Wiltshire. It is a Victorian church and is situated on the Bath Road, Devizes. It is in the Anglican Diocese of Salisbury but is under the Episcopal care of the Bishop of Ebbsfleet, having passed the Act of Synod. It is also a member of the Devizes Partnership of Churches, an ecumenical charity of all the Christian churches in Devizes (except from the Old Baptist Church on Maryport Street).
Background.
St. Peter's is an Anglo-Catholic parish church in Devizes, Wiltshire. It is the youngest of the four Church of England churches in Devizes (it was founded in 1866) and is a member of the pressure group Forward in Faith, being a beacon church in the area. It is in the Diocese of Salisbury, but their PEV (flying bishop) is the Bishop of Ebbsfleet. Resolutions A, B and C have been passed. There is also a Church of England junior school next door to the church, St. Peter's School. 
The church normally attracts roughly 50-60 people for the Sunday Sung Mass, which is always held at 10.00am. This service lasts for roughly an hour and a half, with coffee and biscuits after. There is a Sunday School at St. Peter's that meets during the Sung Mass.
Other services at St. Peter's are a low mass every Thursday evening, and Benediction once a month. Confessions are also heard by the priest twice a week. Evening prayers are held on weekday and Saturday evenings.
A history book about the church was written in 1991 by parishioner Terry Gaylard, who is also the Editor of the Parish Newspaper, 'Church News,' which is published monthly and can be viewed on the St Peter's website.There is an article on St. Peter's Church on the Devizes heritage website.St. Peter's Church
The future of St Peter's.
The future of St Peter's Church is uncertain. St Peter's is a Forward in Faith church and as a majority of the congregation oppose women priests, they may leave the Church of England in 2014, when the first women bishops will be enthroned. The Bishop of Ebbsfleet has appealed to the Roman Catholic Church and he may want to move his parishes to Rome.
The PCC of St Peter's have come up with an idea to build a kitchen and toilets extension on the church, which is being discussed at the moment and seems very likely. Another building project needed is the re-roofing and revamping of the Lady Chapel, which suffers from damp.
In late 2010, St Peter's joined the new Society of St Wilfred and St Hilda, with a view to remaining part of the Catholic tradition within the Anglican Church.
Services.
Below is a list of the services held at St. Peter's:
Weekdays - Morning Prayer (8.00 am)
Evening Prayer (6.00 pm)
Thursday - Low Mass (7.00 pm)
Sunday - Low Mass (BCP) (8.00 am)
Morning Prayer (9.15 am)
High Mass (10.00 am)
Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament (5.00 pm) (1st Sunday in the month only)
Structure of High Mass at St Peter's.
The main service at St. Peter's, the Sunday morning High Mass, takes a typical Anglo-Catholic format. It includes two readings, a sermon from the priest and Holy Communion, as well as the expected ceremony and ritual of incense, vestments and choral singing. The mass under Fr Peter Moss has taken a more Roman Catholic approach as it always concludes with the Angelus being said in the Lady Chapel in front of a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which is censed by the priest.
History.
St Peter's Church was built in the 1860s after Rev Benjamin Dowding, the Priest of St James' Church, Devizes, decided that Devizes needed another church that was nearer to the Kennet and Avon Canal, which flows through Devizes.
The first priest of St Peter's was Fr Harold Grindle, who was loved by the parishioners and who was very giving, and did a lot of work to help the poor. However, he died in 1885, aged 50, whilst he was still the Priest of St Peter's. His successor was Arthur Devas, who also died in office and who built the chancel screen inside the church. However, he never lived to see its completion.
The third priest of St Peter's was Canon Frederick Phipps, who served for 34 years until his death, aged 76. Canon Phipps was a prominent Anglo-Catholic and introduced the use of incense in worship at St Peter's. A photo of Phipps still remains on the postcards of St Peter's, which can be bought from the back of the church. Phipps also served as Rural Dean of Devizes for many years and was well known in the diocese.
Canon Phipps was succeeded by Canon George F. George, an architect by trade who had been in Holy Orders for 18 years and had previously worked in South Africa. Canon George designed the new High Altar and moved the original one into the Lady Chapel.
During World War II, St Peter's Church had three short-serving priests. They were Cyril Reeves Palmer (1939–1941), Sydney Wyman (1941–1944) and George Hamilton Douglas (1944–1950). 
In 1950, Douglas Bryant became priest. He was priest of St Peter's for seven years and in that time, he did much to increase the church's devotional atmosphere. He eventually became a Canon of Guildford Cathedral. Whilst he was at St Peter's, Bryant also installed a new electric heating system in the church, to replace the old boiler. Bryant's son, Mark Bryant, is now the Bishop of Jarrow. 
Vernon Thomas, who was from Wales, was the next priest, and he launched a Christian Stewardship campaign to raise money for the church. As a result of Fr Thomas' campaign, the church was able to raise enough funds to re-wire the whole church and re-roof the South Aisle.
Fr Henry Maude was then priest from 1966–1974, and was replaced by Fr John Croft, a conservative Anglo-Catholic who was a former Laybrother of the Community of the Resurrection, at Mirfield. However, Fr John died in 1985, aged 58. 
Fr John Croft was succeeded by Fr Brian Tigwell, a more liberal Anglo-Catholic who did away with traditions such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament that had been advocated by his more Catholic successor (most of these traditions, including Benediction, have now been restored). However, Fr Brian increased the amount of money given to the poor and disadvantaged. He also forged a strong link between the church and the school, and attracted large congregations. He could especially connect to the children and was loved by the students of St Peter's School. Fr Brian also completely re-decorated the inside of the church, and installed a new electrical lighting system. He also served as Rural Dean of Devizes from 1993-1998. Although Fr Brian was fairly liberal on the issue of the ordination of women in the Church of England, it was whilst he was priest that the church PCC voted in favour of passing Resolutions A and B. When Fr Brian left St Peter's in 1999, he gave the church a thurible that he had previously owned as a gift of thanks.
Fr Brian sought early retirement in 1999, aged only 63, and was replaced after an interregnum of one year by Fr Leslie Attwood, a priest from Cornwall. Fr Leslie only served as priest for two years as he was offered another job elsewhere.
When Fr Leslie resigned in 2002, the church then went through the longest interregnum of any Devizes church. It wasn't until 2005 that they finally appointed another priest. During this interregnum, the Assistant Priest, Fr John Goodman, took over the day-to-day running of the church as acting priest. This was a dark period for St Peter's and there were fears of its closure.
However, in 2005 a new priest, Fr Peter Moss, was appointed. Fr Peter has done a lot to improve the worship at St Peter's by introducing the use of the Angelus and focussing on the Communion of Saints. Under Fr Peter, St Peter's has also passed Resolution C, becoming a full member of Forward in Faith. Recently, St Peter's has refurbished their pipe organ, redecorated the entrance porch and replaced the old Stations of the Cross with new ones that were given to St Peter's by the local Roman Catholic Church. He retired in the summer of 2013.
Stations and icons.
St Peter's has a lovely, hand-carved, wooden collection of Stations of the Cross that decorate the walls of the church. It also has a collection of icons, including one of St Paul and one of St Peter, which was given to the church by a parishioner, Estelle Holloway.
Ecumenicalism and relations with other churches in Devizes.
St Peter's is heavily involved in ecumenical activities with the other Christian churches in Devizes of other denominations. It is a member of the Devizes Partnership of Churches and recently took part in the 'Believing in Devizes' week.
St Peter's is also very close to the Catholic Church of Our Lady the Immaculate Conception, the Catholic church in Devizes.
Rural Dean of Devizes.
Only two priests of St Peter's Church have ever served as Rural Dean of Devizes. They were Canon Frederick Phipps, the church's longest serving priest ever, and Fr Brian Tigwell, who is now retired and lives in Somerset with his wife, Mary. The current Rural Dean of Devizes is Rev Sallyanne Attwater, priest of The Church of St Mary the Virgin, Bishops Cannings.
St Peter's Primary School.
St Peter's Church of England Primary School is a state funded school situated next door to the church on Bath Road, Devizes. The priest of St Peter's is normally the Chair of Governors of the school and the current Headteacher of St Peter's School is Miss Catherine Davis, who took over from Mrs Sandy Fletcher in 2009.

Azerbaijan–Romania relations

Romania-Azerbaijan relations are foreign relations between Azerbaijan and Romania. The countries have established embassies in their respective capitals. The Azeri president visited Romania in October 2004 and the two nations have signed over fifty separate agreements to date.
History.
Azerbaijani-Romanian relations dates back to the 15th century when Uzun Hasan and the Moldavian prince Stephan the Great signed an agreement on military cooperation. This cooperation has continued during the reign of Safavi Empire of Azerbaijan & Iran. It is assumed that the first print work in Azerbaijani appeared with the participation of the Romanian prince Dmitry Kantemir. Accompanying Peter I in his journey to the pre-Caspian countries Prince Dmitry wrote the text of the king's appeal to the local population in the Azerbaijani language.
Romania officially recognized Azerbaijan’s independence on December 11, 1991. The two countries established diplomatic relations on June 19, 1992. While the two share mutual areas in multiple areas, the main focus has been on trade and energy links, with trade delegations and frequent talks regarding the further development of such ties and an increase in bilateral trade since trade originating from Azerbaijan approximately five times the quantity ($161 million) of those from Romania ($31.83 million).
As an existing member, Romania has been a strong advocate of Azerbaijan's future membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), pointing out the strategic importance of the country for trade and shipping, particularly with a view towards Afghanistan.
Agreements.
In 2000, Azerbaijan and Romania signed an agreement on bilateral defence cooperation, followed by a similar agreement on information sharing in 2004. In December 2007, a Romanian energy delegation visited Azerbaijan. The two parties discussed a gas pipeline and emphasised the importance of the two nations' cooperation in order to provide "energy security in Europe".
State visit.
In 2004, the Azeri president made a two day state visit to Romania, during which time, the two leaders held private meetings on a range of issues, including, inter alia, the relationship between the two countries and opportunities for cooperation on counter- terrorism. Eleven separate were signed as a result of these meetings.
Also during this visit, the president officially opened a new embassy building, emphasising the role of the embassy in the continuation and development of relations between the nations.

Ravenstor railway station

Ravenstor railway station is a Heritage railway station at the northernmost limit of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway, Wirksworth, Derbyshire.
History.
Ravenstor station came into existence through the activities of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway Association (EVRA). Working with WyvernRail to reopen the former Wirksworth-Duffield branch line the decision was made to create a passenger carrying service where previously only mineral traffic (limestone) had ever been transported. The particular interest lay in the fact that the line was on an incline of 1 in 27; steep indeed for any railway line.
Work over a number of years including the building of an entirely new platform culminated in August 2005 with the opening of the line for passenger services. The first service ran on 1 September 2005 and the station was opened in a ceremony by Gwyneth Dunwoody, MP, Commons Transport Committee Chairman, on 2 September 2005.
Operation.
The service runs regularly at weekends, holidays and special events.
Location.
Ravenstor was a former concentration site for local quarries and did not have a passenger service until one was introduced by the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. It lies at the bottom of a disused incline which was built to link it to the Cromford and High Peak Railway, now the site of the National Stone Centre and the Steeple Grange Light Railway.
However it is hoped that one day once funds will be made available for a possible extension up the incline towards Middleton Top, depending how steep it would be. It would also serve the nearby National Stone Centre above.

James Drake (engineer)

Sir James Drake CBE (27 July 1907 – 1 February 1989) was a chartered civil engineer who is regarded as the pioneer of the national motorway network in the United Kingdom. As the County Surveyor and Bridgemaster of Lancashire County Council from 1945 to 1972 he led teams that designed the first stretch of motorway opened to the public, the Preston By-pass (now the M6 from Junctions 29 to 32) on 5 December 1958. There then followed numerous contracts to extend the motorway in the north west of England, which, thanks to his role, probably still has the greatest density of motorways in the country. He was awarded a CBE in 1962 for his services as County Surveyor and Bridgemaster of Lancashire County Council and in 1973 he was knighted in recognition of his role as head of the North West Road Construction Unit and the Lancashire Sub-Unit, organisations that further extended his initial work.
Early life.
Drake was born in Burnley, Lancashire, and was educated at Accrington Grammar School and the Victoria University of Manchester where he graduated in 1927 with a BSc in Civil Engineering, with first-class honours. He passed the professional exams of the Institution of Civil Engineers in April 1931, and was accepted as an associate in 1933 and as a full member in 1943. He married Kathleen Shaw on 6 July 1937 and they had two daughters, Diana and Jane.
Early work.
His working life was spent in the north west of England, and, but for the first three years of his career when he worked for Stockport County Borough Council (1927 – 1930), he was based entirely in Lancashire. He spent seven years at Bootle County Borough Council (1930 – 37) and from there moved to Blackpool County Borough Council (1937–45), initially as Deputy Engineer and Surveyor and latterly as Borough Engineer and Surveyor. In the early part of his career he worked on the design of a wide range of municipal engineering schemes. These included a sports stadium and cycle track; an eighteen-hole golf course; municipal offices; housing estates; libraries; schools; sea defences; an 18 mile sewerage system; a 7 mile ring road; and the construction of Britain's first multi-storey car park with integrated bus station.
In 1937 Drake travelled to Germany with the German Road Delegation to view autobahn construction. In the late 1930s and even during the Second World War many new road schemes were planned for the United Kingdom. The County Surveyors' Society and the Institution of Highway Engineers published reports that outlined the needs for and the benefits of a new high capacity highway network. During the Second World War, Winston Churchill had proposals drawn up to improve transport infrastructure. During this time Drake became a strong advocate of motorways for access, speed, safety and commerce. He went on to pursue his ideas locally, nationally and internationally.
Birth of the motorway network.
In 1945 he was appointed the County Surveyor and Bridgemaster of Lancashire County Council, a post he would hold until 1972. Drake published his Road Plan for Lancashire in 1949. Funds for public works were severely limited following the end of the Second World War and so Drake had a number of bridge engineers available, with little design work to occupy them, but with the necessary skills to measure and project traffic flows and manipulate data. This comprehensive document formed the basis of the County's development plan for more than thirty years and went on to become the basis of national highway planning procedures.
Drake realised that following the Second World War there would not be large amounts of public money available for significant new developments. He considered that the only way to develop a strategic road network would be to let a series of contracts, each of which would extend or link up with previously constructed sections and thus lead to the creation of a new road network. link title
Preston by-pass.
From 1946 government plans incorporated a new north-south trunk route through Lancashire. So did Drake's plan, which he pressed on government from 1949 to 1955. Work began in 1956 on the Preston bypass with the county as the government's agent. This became the first section of Britain's motorway system, opened to traffic in 1958.
Drake and Lancashire County Council had long recognised that a new type of highway was necessary for the mass movement of people and goods on a swift and safe basis. However
Drake believed that the projected traffic figures for the by-pass justified the construction of three lanes in each direction. However, despite his requests for additional funding, the Ministry of Transport insisted that this could not be justified. Drake's response to this was to indeed create a motorway with two lanes in each direction, but with an extra wide central reservation. Bridges over the by-pass were built with sufficient clearance and headroom to accept dual three lanes in each direction without modification. This meant that when the inevitable widening took place it did so relatively easily.
Drake realised that motorways would have a significant impact on the communities that they passed through and tried to ensure that their impact was minimised.
The scheme design and supervision was carried out by the County Surveyor's Department of Lancashire County Council, as Agent for the Ministry of Transport. The Contractor was Tarmac Ltd who carried out the roadworks, they engaged Leonard Fairclough Ltd as a sub-contractor for the majority of the bridgeworks. The two multi-span steel bridges, Samlesbury Bridge and Higher Walton Bridge were built under separate contracts by Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company Ltd and Dorman Long (Bridge and Engineering) Ltd respectively.
The scheme was opened by the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan on 5 December 1958. It was the first length of motorway opened to the public in the United Kingdom, with no speed limit and the largest road signs in Europe.
Motorway expansion.
Even as Preston By-pass was being opened Drake had Lancaster By-pass under construction and numerous other schemes at outline design or detail design stages.
Commemorative plaque.
On 5 December 2008 Lancashire County Council, the Institution of Civil Engineers and the then Institution of Highways and Transportation arranged for the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate Drake's role in the development of the motorway network. The event was held on the 50th anniversary of the opening of Preston By-pass, adjacent to the spot where the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan had opened the first section of motorway. The plaque is sited at the back of the footway/cycleway adjacent to the A59 at M6 Junction 31. It is immediately to the west of Samlesbury Bridge, which takes the M6 over the River Ribble, at this location.
At 12.00 Councillor Alan Whittaker, the Chairman of Lancashire County Council, and Lord Adonis, Secretary of State at the Department of Transport, each made a short speech before unveiling the plaque, along with Sir James Drake's daughters, Diana and Jane, and Harry Yeadon. Harry Yeadon had worked on both the design and supervision of the by-pass scheme and in 1974 succeeded to the post of Lancashire's County Surveyor and Bridgemaster.

Norton Safe Web

Norton Safe Web (sometimes abbreviated NSW) is a service developed by Symantec Corporation that is designed to help users identify malicious websites. Safe Web delivers information about websites based on automated analysis and user feedback.
The software debuted as a public beta in 2008, and is now included in current versions of Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. A limited, standalone version of Safe Web, known as Safe Web Lite, is available as a freeware. Safe Web operates as a web browser plugin, and requires Internet Explorer 6 or Firefox 3 or later. Safe Web in Norton 2012 also supports Google Chrome. (lite) 
Function.
In addition to actively crawling and analyzing web sites, Norton Safe Web relies on feedback from users and "Norton Community" participants. When a drive-by download occurs at a web site, the suspicious URL is automatically reported to Norton Safe Web for analysis. The reported site is rated as unsafe if the analysis confirms that the download is malicious.
To ensure that its site rating accurately reflects the current state of a site, Norton Safe Web performs frequent re-analysis of Web sites. Norton Safe Web employs a site rating aging algorithm which estimates how often the safety of a particular Web site will change. Some of the factors used in this analysis include the site's rating history, the site's reputation and associations, the number and types of threats detected on the site, the number of submissions received from Norton clients, and site traffic. In other words, unsafe sites that are more likely to have been cleaned up are re-analyzed often while those that might take longer to remove detected threats are re-analyzed less frequently. User reviews are also accepted, with contributors ranked by reputation. Should a site owner dispute the ranking of their site, they can submit a request for re-evaluation after completing a validation process.
Incorporation.
Safe Web is installed alongside Norton Internet Security 2009 and Norton 360 version 3.0 as a browser toolbar. It color codes search results returned by Yahoo!, Google, and Bing Search using green, yellow, or red. Hovering over a pop-up summary will bring up a summary of the findings, and include a link to the full report of the site. Safe Web will also prompt or interrupt access to malicious sites users try to access directly via the address bar.
Reception.
Safe Web blocks phishing sites, overlapping in functionality with Norton Internet Security and Norton 360. Using Norton 360 v3, "PC Magazine" found discrepancies between Safe Web and Norton 360's built-in phishing protection. Symantec stated that phishing sites change rapidly, and one Norton service may be using older definitions than the other. Safe Web has also created some controversy among Windows Live! Plus users as it shows that the Windows Live! Plus website contains malware.
Norton Safe Web Lite.
A free version of the software, Safe Web Lite, is available free of charge. The primary difference between the version of Safe Web bundled with Norton Internet Security and Norton 360 and Safe Web Lite is that Safe Web Lite does not block malicious websites. However Norton AntiVirus updates it with Norton SafeWeb Statics when Norton SafeWeb Lite is installed on your computer.
Green means safe. Yellow/Orange means caution. Red means warning.

Brennan v HM Advocate

Brennan v HM Advocate 1977 JC 38 was a Scots criminal appeal case decided in the High Court of Justiciary in its capacity as the Court of Criminal Appeal. The case set the precedent that voluntary intoxication, whether by drink or drugs, cannot be used to establish defences of automatism or insanity.
Brennan had been convicted of murdering his father during a state of intoxication. This was held not to qualify as automatism as the appelant had entered this state voluntarily. The Court based this reasoning on a number of passages from the work of Baron Hume, one of the institutional writers.
It was also held insufficient to meet the requirements of the special defence of insanity. Lord Justice General Lord Emslie stated:
The defendant's appeal against conviction for murder was refused.

B1354 road

The B1354 runs for about between the A148 at Thursford and the B1149 at Saxthorpe, and is entirely within the county of Norfolk. The road is the main route of access to Norwich and to Fakenham for the large villages of Melton Constable and Briston.
The route.
The route of this old thoroughfare can be clearly made out on William Faden’s map of Norfolk which was surveyed between 1790 and 1794. This map, the first large-scale map (at one inch to the mile) of the whole county, is a record of the landscape and transport system of the county of Norfolk in late 18th century, and shows that despite the Parliamentary Enclosure of the early 19th century the route has changed very little. Much of the route on the map is highlighted in a pale pink which marks it out as an important artery of the time. In recent years the roads route has been redirected from its junction with the A148 at Thursford for a distance of and now takes the route of the old track bed of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway route between Melton Constable and Fakenham.
Points of interest.
At the point on the route were the road leaves the old track bed and returns to its original course the road passes the old Gunthorpe level crossing gatehouse and signal box on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, which has been restored to its former glory and is now a tea room.
Heading from the West-north-west end, on the road reaches Melton Constable and on the south side of the road there is an industrial area that was once the site of the busy junction of four railway lines. The lines which came from Cromer, North Walsham, King's Lynn and Norwich and linked Norfolk to the Midlands. There was once a station with a platform long and Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway's main workshops and factory were also situated here. This made this road a busy and important part of Norfolk’s transport infrastructure.

Norway–Romania relations

Norway–Romania relations are foreign relations between Norway and Romania. Both countries established diplomatic relations on April 3, 1917. Norway has an embassy in Bucharest and an honorary consulate in Constanţa. Romania has an embassy in Oslo and 4 honorary consulates (in Bergen, Kristiansand, Stavanger and Trondheim).
Both countries are full members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and of the Council of Europe.
History.
The earliest contact between the Romanian and Norwegian people may have been in the 9th century AD when Varangians began trading with the Byzantine Empire along routes that led through Romania. There are a number of Varangian relics in modern-day Romania. 
However, formal relations between the modern states began only in 1917, towards the end of the First World War. Relations were interrupted during the Second World War (1939–1945), but formally resumed in 1946. Relations greatly improved after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Norway was one of the first countries to recognize the new regime in Romania after the revolution, and the Norwegian embassy in Bucharest was reopened in the summer of 1990.
Agreements.
In 1993 representatives of Norway and Romania meeting in Oslo agreed to modifications to their 1991 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreement on trade in textiles. In 2002, the two countries signed an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the Kyoto protocol. In September 2004, Romania and Norway signed an agreement on energy and the environment. In August 2007 Norway made an agreement with the EU concerning a Cooperation Programme for Economic Growth and Sustainable Development in Romania. The cost to Norway was almost 100 million euros. In November 2007 Romanian President Traian Băsescu (a former naval captain who studied at the Shipping Academy in Norway) signed an agreement in Oslo on research and educational cooperation between 3 leading maritime universities in Romania and NCE Maritime.
Official meetings and statements.
In September 1999 King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway made a state visit to Romania where they met with president Emil Constantinescu and his wife. During the visit, Norway's Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek expressed Norwegian support for Romania's bid to join NATO. In September 2002, Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Năstase made a formal visit to Oslo where he met Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik. Among other subject, Nastase asked for Norway's continued support for Romania's NATO bid.
In July 2003 Norwegian Defence Minister Kristin Krohn Devold visited Bucharest where she met President Ion Iliescu. They discussed improvements in Romanian-Norwegian defence cooperation, as well as greater bilateral cooperation in other fields. In February 2004, Norway's Foreign Minister Jan Petersen met Romanian Premier Adrian Năstase in Bucharest. They discussed the excellent relations between the countries and further development of the partnership. Romania joined NATO in March 2004. In May 2004, Romanian National Defence Minister Ioan Mircea Pascu said he expected "special" military ties with Norway to improve as a result.
In September 2004, Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik visited Romania where he met with President Ion Iliescu and other officials. They discussed strengthened cooperation in strategic fields as NATO partners, as well as improved economic cooperation once Romania joined the European Union. In November 2007, Romanian President Traian Băsescu visited Norway where he met with King Harald V. The two men praised the 90 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and solid cooperation in foreign affairs. Also in November 2007, leaders of the two country's police services agreed to further improve bilateral cooperation aiming at preventing and combatting serious crime.
Business.
In 2003, imports from Romania to Norway were about $157 million, mostly ship hulls. Norwegian exports to Romania were about $34 million and included machinery, fish, seafood and electrical machinery. Speaking in May 2005, Norwegian ambassador to Romania Leif Arne Ulland noted that bilateral trade had grown strongly in the last ten years, reaching 141 million Euro in 2004. Norwegian investment in Romania could be around 100 million Euro.
Norwegian companies operating in Romania in 2005 included Aker, employing 6,500 people, IMGB Kvaerner and Orkla Foods. Aker is now STX Europe, owned by the South Korean industrial chaebol STX Corporation. It is the largest shipbuilding group in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. With headquarters in Oslo, Norway, STX Europe operates 15 shipyards in Brazil, Finland, France, Norway, Romania and Vietnam. IMGB Kvaerner is now owned by the Korean giant Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction. The Norwegian firm Jacobsen Electro is a partner with Romelectro in developing the Romanian electricity transmission and distribution network.
By 2006, trade volumes had reached 307 million Euro. Investments by Norwegian businesspeople had grown to 120 million Euro. In February 2007 the European Union put pressure on Norway, a non-EU country, to increase the payments it makes in return for access to the European market to account for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
Heavy water incident.
In May 1988 reports were published that said Romania had sold heavy water to Israel that had been purchased from Norway. Heavy water is a key ingredient in making plutonium for nuclear bombs. Romania denied the allegations. Norway had asked Israel in 1987 for confirmation that the heavy water is not being used to make bombs, but as of July 1989 Israel had not agreed to inspections.

List of job scheduler software

This is a list of notable job scheduling software. Job scheduling applications are designed to carry out repetitive tasks as defined in a schedule based upon calendar and event conditions. More recently this category of software is increasingly labeled as 'Workload Automation', which is an industry term for the next generation of job scheduling applications.
Abstract.
The products are divided into four categories: standalone vendor software
supporting "ERP" (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, standalone vendor software without ERP support, non-vendor schedulers, and finally; platform built-ins. (Typically the goal of "ERP software" is to facilitate the flow of information between all business functions within an organization.)<br> 
Only products having a Wikipedia page for it or its vendor are listed.<br>
The products are ordered alphabetically.
Job scheduling products with ERP support.
For the description of the functionalities in the table header, just click on it.
Job scheduling products without ERP support.
For the description of the functionalities in the table header just click on it.
Descriptions of the features.
Version.
The information in this table is regarding this product version.
Platforms.
All kinds of Unix flavours mentioned by the vendors are notes as "Unix". The same goes for "Linux" and "Windows" and Mac.
Any OS account.
Can the agent run a job as any OS-account on the target system? The agent of some products can only run a job as the user the agent runs as, which most likely must have a lot of privileges, which in turn might be a security issue.
stdout/err transfer.
Can you inspect the standard output and/or standard error of the executed job on your viewer? Some systems even immediately transfer both to the central scheduler, which might give extra network load.
File events.
Can the job scheduler react (start a job) on the appearance of a file? With this you don't have to poll for the file.
File transfer.
Some vendors deliver a file transfer utility. The standard command-line FTP on e.g. Unix is not good enough for batch usage: a file might be failed to transfer, yet the 'bye' command went well so the exit status will be ok. The file that may link both the server's will give a proper scheduler procedure in the process.
ERP support.
The list of ERP packages supported.
SAP XBP version.
The SAP XBP interface comes in 2 versions: 2 and 3. Version 2 has an intercept table, while version 3 has for intercept an include and an exclude table. This is important when you want all SAP-jobs but a few being intercepted and routed through your scheduling system. Some SAP-jobs won't work well when intercepted.
Role-based security.
Is it possible to grant privileges through roles to the users of your scheduling system? Think of developers, operators and administrators. Some products use LDAP or the Windows system AD.
Auditing.
Some companies demand recording of all user actions (compliance), but if not it is still handy to backtrace who did some action, just to ask him why he did so.
Design lifecycle.
Does the job scheduling system support the transfer of batch designs along development, test, approve and production repositories? Most products have an export- and import-feature, and some products have the transfer mechanism all built-in.
User Interfaces.
Lists what kind of user interfaces are available to access the job Scheduler.

Adam Thom

Adam Thom (30 August 1802 – 21 February 1890) was a teacher, journalist, lawyer, public servant, and recorder.
Biography.
Adam Thom was born in Brechin, in the Tayside region in Scotland. His father was Andrew Thom, a merchant, and his mother Elizabeth Bisset.
He entered the King's College in 1819 and obtained a Master of Arts in 1824. He taught briefly at the Udny Academy, in Aberdeenshire and also in a school of Woolwich where he settled. He published a grammar of Latin entitled "The Complete Gradus" in 1832.
He emigrated to Lower Canada in 1832 and settled in Montreal. He began articling in the law office of James Charles Grant. In January 1833, he became editor of the "Settler, or British, Irish and Canadian Gazette" until its closing on December 31, 1833. The Anti-Canadian opinions he expressed in his newspaper gave him the nickname of "Dr. Slop" in the "Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser" edited by patriot Edmund Bailey O' Callaghan. In November 1833, he was appointed secretary of the Beefsteak Club, which gathered some of the richest merchants of Montreal.
He went back to teaching at the Montreal Academical Institution. He published a public letter addressed to Colonial Secretary Lord Stanley in 1834. In January 1835, he became editor of the "Montreal Herald". He strongly opposed the policy of governor Gosford, which he judged too conciliating toward the parliamentary majority. In February 1836, he published the "Anti-Gallic Letters", a collection of texts addressed to Gosford, which he originally signed under the pseudonym of Camillus in the "Montreal Herald" between September 1835 and January 1836.
He was admitted to the Bar of Lower Canada in 1837. On 25 August 1838, Lord Durham who replaced Gosford, appointed him assistant commissioner in the commission on municipal administration presided by Charles Buller. He became the spokesman of Durham and the paper he wrote with fellow assistant commissioner William Kennedy was included in the "Report on the Affairs of British North America". In December, he embarked for England to help with the drafting of the final document.
He left England for Red River Colony to fill the position of recorder offered to him by George Simpson, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. He was asked to reform the administration of justice, and to codify the laws of the colony.
He arrived at Red River in the Spring 1839. In 1840, the King's College made him a doctor of laws. His career as a jurist for the Hudson's Bay Company was animated. He refused to use the French language, which he knew, even though the duties of his office required it. In 1845, he condemned to death a Saulteaux Indian by the name of Capineseweet, although according to the law, all capital cases had to be tried in Upper Canada.
He entered in conflict with the Métis, which were mainly French-speaking and Catholic, when he recommended the governor Assiniboia, Alexander Christie, to repress the business of small independent fur traders on the company's territory. In consequence of the measures taken by the government, Pierre-Guillaume Sayer was tried before the court on 17 May 1849 and was declared guilty of illicit possession of furs by the jury. He was however unconditionally released and permitted to keep the furs in spite of the verdict, because the Métis who attended the trial, Louis Riel Sr. at their head, made it clear they were not going to let it happen.
The Métis submitted a petition to the governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, George Simpson, in which they asked for the resignation of Thom. During a special meeting on 31 May 1849, the Council of Assiniboia arrived to a compromise with Thom, who agreed to make use of the French language in the performance of his duties. He however continued to displease a good part of the population of River Red and in the autumn of 1850, Louis Riel Sr. again requested his resignation. On 10 April 1851, Simpson informed Thom that he was relieved of his duties as recorder. Many of his duties were assumed by John Black, his former deputy. He however kept the title of clerk of the Court of Assiniboia and even continued to receive the same annual salary of £700.
He left Red River for Edinburgh in 1854. In 1865, he settled in London. He died in that city on 21 February 1890. His son, Adam Bisset Thom, inherited his fortune.

Hannes Vanaküla, also known as Tokroda (born 23 November 1966 in Tallinn), is an Estonian mage. In media he has been called a charlatan and a cult leader.
Activities.
In 2004, Vanaküla claimed to have transported "energy pillars", supposedly mystical structures helpful of magical work, from throughout the world to Estonia, supposedly their original and rightful positions. These claims, as well as the controversy over reality and transportability of those energy pillars between Vanaküla and Vormsi Enn, another esoteric practitioner, were reported in various media. Reportedly, the procedure involved Vanaküla and 21 followers entering trance for "several days" and "identifying with energy pillars throughout the world". The original locations were reported as Egypt, Tibet, United States and Lapland.
In 2008, Vanaküla and two of his followers participated in "Selgeltnägijate tuleproov" (), a TV show formulated as a contest between magic practitioners and based on the format of America's Psychic Challenge. His followers were noted for applying unusual items, such as mace and bucket, for divination.
Shortly after the TV show series began, Vanaküla and his two followers from the show agreed to take on the skeptik.ee 10 000 EEK challenge in a test of their telepathical powers. The agreed-on protocol involved a "transmitter" being shown various household items randomly drawn from a duffel bag whose content had not been revealed to participants before the experiment, and asking the "recipients" – the rôle of Vanaküla and his followers – to guess the items. The results were to be considered positive if any of the three participants would have guessed correctly at least three items out of six "transmissions".
The experiment's results were considered negative, as all three participants guessed correctly zero items out of six "transmissions".
Media exposure.
On 28 January 2009, ETV's Pealtnägija (English: "Witness", an Estonian popular documentary series similar to Canada's "Witness") ran a segment reporting on activities of Vanaküla and his followers, sometimes referred to as tokronauts, spurring media interest in Vanaküla and his followers. Reportedly, most of the followers consider themselves gods and Vanaküla a god of light, Vanaküla himself explaining in the interview to Pealtnägija that he believes that every creative human being is a god. According to cited and interviewed sources, Vanaküla's followers are encouraged to think of outsiders as "people of lower quality" and to withdraw from them; on the other hand, Vanaküla himself is considered a "person of the highest quality", which gives him the power to "repair" women through sex.
Reportedly, the tokronauts have repeatedly attempted to kill various people through "spiritual means". A particular target of such an assassination attempt – admitted by Vanaküla in the interview by Pealtnägija but dismissed as a simple experiment by a single follower – was Condoleezza Rice. When a journalist of delfi.ee asked Harrys Puusepp, the spokesman of Estonia's Northern Police District whether such an admission can lead to criminal investigation into attempted murder or conspiracy to commit murder, Puusepp responded by asking if the journalist was sober, then stated that such an investigation would be contrary to sanity.
The resulting media exposure led to Vanaküla's firing from his long-term position as a leather dyer.
Vanaküla has ascribed Pealtnägija's interest in the affair to a conspiracy involving Christians, Freemasons, and the Estonian party of Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica.
Political discussions.
On 18 February 2009, nine members of Riigikogu from the opposition party Keskerakond made a formal inquiry to Estonian Minister of Internal Affairs Jüri Pihl regarding the activities of Vanaküla's sect, asking whether this sect – which they characterised as an 'extremist group' – and others like it are being investigated by the Estonian police and how such activities are regulated under Estonian law.
Bibliography.
In 2007, Vanaküla self-published a book "Maagia alustalad. Kakskümmend ülekandeliini" (ISBN 9789949152223). His publicity stunts, such as advertising his book, caused some media interest.
The book has been translated to English as "The Basics of Magic. The Twenty Energy Transfer Channels" (ISBN 9780979462436), printed by Noria Books.
Although Noria Books has undertaken the printing, the book is a self-publication, fully paid for by Vanaküla himself.

Shock Theater

Shock Theater (marketed as Shock!) was a package of 52 classic horror films from Universal Studios released for television showings in October 1957 by Screen Gems, the television subsidiary of Columbia Pictures. The Shock Theater package included "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "The Mummy", "The Invisible Man" and the "The Wolf Man". A second package, Son of Shock, was released for television by Screen Gems in 1958, with 20 horror films from both Universal and Columbia.
Shock Theater usually aired on late night television on weekends with a costumed horror host; a well-known example was Zacherley (John Zacherle) on Philadelphia's WCAU-TV (as 'Roland'), 1957–1958, and New York's WABC-TV, 1958–1959. Prior to Zacherely's arrival at WABC-TV, Shock Theater was hosted off-camera by ABC Staff Announcer Scott Vincent. Shock Theater continued the American tradition of horror film television shows that originated with Vampira (Maila Nurmi) at Los Angeles KABC-TV 1954–1955. Shock Theater programs in major cities were often introduced by local hosts in the style of Zacherley or Vampira.
One of the most innovative of the series was produced during 1962-63 at the Los Angeles Television station KTLA-TV which was owned by Gene Autry. Gene Autry brought in Bill Aken as musical director and overall producer. Aken re-vamped the commercial breaks making them as entertaining as the films themselves. With spooky music and actors costumed as monsters such as Frankenstein and Dracula, the commercials for sponsor Baldwin Chevrolet took on a whole new aspect. Host Joe Salazar was driven onto the set in an ambulance carrying a coffin which Salazar would emerge from to start the show. Joined by 'Monsters' in all the Chevrolet commercials, with a special theme song, the show garnered an avid fan base all over the Los Angeles area during the two years it was on the air.
Screen Gems acquired a 10-year lease of the television rights to 550 Universal Pictures features in June 1957, with the intention of packaging them by formats and stars, including horror, crime, and comedy. The first Shock package was an instant success nationwide. Viewership measurements in five key television markets (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, San Antonio) showed the program boosting ratings anywhere from 38 percent to 1,125 percent.
Shock Theater stimulated interest in the classic horror films and actors, evidenced by the launching of Forrest J Ackerman's "Famous Monsters of Filmland" magazine in early 1958. 
Since 1957, Shock Theater has become a generic term, referencing either late night television showings of horror films in general or the genre of early horror films with their emphasis on spooky mood and implied horror, as opposed to the explicitly graphic horror films that followed.

Ritam

Ritam (Serbian Cyrillic: "Ритам", trans. "Rhythm") was a Serbian and Yugoslav popular culture magazine. 
Started in February 1989, it continued under various subtitles and publishing companies until 1995. Initially a monthly publication (from 1989 until 1991), "Ritam"'s publishing frequency became fairly irregular from summer 1991 until the final end of its run.
History.
"Ritam" was founded in 1989 with the subtitle of "Mesečni vodič kroz popularnu muziku, film, video, strip... i još više!" ('Monthly guide through popular music, film, video, comics... and more!). It was co-published by two companies — Sportinvest from Belgrade and ROID Vuk Karadžić from Paraćin. The magazine's first editor-in-chief was Momčilo Rajin. The first "Ritam" issue, featuring U2 band members, actor Jackie Chan, and comic book character Corto Maltese on the cover, was released on February 1, 1989. Until June 1990, 14 issues were released.
From September 1990, the magazine adopted a new name, "Novi Ritam" ("The New Rhythm"), as well as a shortened subtitle, "Mesečni vodič kroz popularnu kulturu" (Monthly guide through popular culture), and Rajin's post was taken over by Branko Vukojević. The magazine staffers also registered their own publishing company called Ritam, and continued to cooperate with Paraćin's Vuk Karadžić. This lasted until May 1991, during which time 8 issues appeared.
At the end of 1992, following a year-and-a-half long gap, the magazine's third incarnation appeared, entitled "Ritam" again. Under editorship of Dragan Ambrozić, and in addition to Ritam publishing company, record label Sorabia Disc was also listed as the magazine's publisher. Only two issues appeared under this setup, the first in October, with Rambo Amadeus on the cover, and the second in December, with Michael Stipe on the cover.
In 1993, "Ritam"'s fourth incarnation appeared. Again with Ambrozić as editor-in-chief, and with the subtitle "Vodič kroz popularnu kulturu" (Guide through popular culture), the annual issue was published for the year 1993. Five more issues came out from May 1994 until June 1995 with irregular frequency.
In 2004, online magazine "Popboks" was founded, containing a digitalized archive of "Ritam".

Series Three, Episode Twenty (Waterloo Road)

The twentieth episode of Series Three of British school drama "Waterloo Road" aired on the 17th March 2008 (13 March 2008 in Scotland), and was the season finale of series 3, directed by Richard Standeven and written by Lisa Holdsworth.
Plot.
The episode was a continuation of the events in several of the previous episodes, in which headteacher Rachel Mason's past, as a prostitute, was being kept secret by herself and deputy head Eddie Lawson. Rachel was being blackmailed by Stuart Hordly, who also knew of her past. In this episode, Waterloo Road holds a spelling bee against a rival school. Waterloo Road win, but during Rachel's speech Stuart Hordly storms into the assembly hall and reveals Rachel's past to the room of stunned pupils and teachers. Rachel, shocked and upset, confirms that Hordly's words were true, then runs to her office and cries, as she thinks her job is over.
Eddie arrives in Rachel's office to find her clearing out her desk. He tries his best to persuade her to stay but Rachel is adamant that she won't have the kids hounded by the press and Waterloo Road dragged through the gutter. Downstairs, Rachel's staunchest supporters do their best to turn the tide against her: Candice is extremely vocal in her defence of the only teacher who's ever been able to get through to Bolton. Rachel still believes that the school board will vote her out of the job. However, she must still deal with the issue of two of her pupils cheating in exams, by copying coursework from the internet. Prepared to fight for the school's reputation, Rachel takes charge and demands to know why the cheating didn't come to light during routine coursework moderation. The answer is revealed that no moderating went on. The rest of the staff, Jasmine and Matt in particular, are quick to pin the blame on Grantly and his lazy ways and a squabble soon ensues. Rachel breaks it up and then orders Grantly into her office. She has no choice but to suspend him, and with Grantly gone, Tom is made acting Head of English and placed in charge of the investigation. He's appalled to his stepdaughter Chlo's name on the list of cheating pupils.
An argument between the pair ensues, with Tom telling Chlo that she has a good chance of being expelled. Meanwhile, Stuart Hordley is still outside, smoking by the bins. Realising he's got nothing left to lose, he throws his cigerette end away and sets off in search of Rachel. He runs into her on the stairs, where Rachel has kicks him, causing him to fall down a flight of stairs. As Rachel attempts to help him up, dinnerlady Candice trips over the tube connecting a gas canister to the heater and is called away from the kitchen before she can smell the leaking gas. Hordley's smouldering cigarette sets the bins alight, causing a huge fireball to rip through the school, setting the canteen and parts of the school alight, and causing classrooms to explode.
Bolton rescues teacher Davina in the aftermath of the blast, but their luck runs out when they run into a chained door. Elsewhere, Chlo is trapped inside the girls' toilets as flames consume the corridor outside. With no way out, she fumbles her mobile phone out of her bag and calls Donte. Outside, Celine is terrified when Donte receives Chlo's call and begs him not to go after her, telling him she's pregnant. Shocked, but disbelieving, Donte storms off. Davina is carried out of the school, unconscious. As Davina is taken away in the back of an ambulance, Eddie realises that Rachel is still inside the school and the fire-fighters won't let him back in to find her. Inside, Rachel is on her way towards the nearest exit when she spots Hordley unconscious on the floor. She runs to rescue him from certain death, but as she starts to drag him out, the roof collapses, burying her and Hordley with it. The final shot of the series is of her and Hordly on the floor, unconscious under piles of rubble.

Stephen Salter

Stephen Hugh Salter (born 7 December 1938) is Emeritus Professor of Engineering Design at the University of Edinburgh and inventor of the eponymous Salter duck wave energy device. Salter is also a proponent of geoengineering and is responsible for creating the concept of the mechanical enhancement of clouds to achieve cloud reflectivity enhancement.
The wide tank at the University of Edinburgh — a novel design and invention by Stephen Salter, built in 1977 — was the world's first multi-directional wave tank equipped with absorbing wavemakers. Feedback control systems on the wavemaking flaps were used for the absorption of reflected waves, propagating along the water surface of the tank interior towards the 89 flaps.
Stephen Salter is a Specialist Advisor at wave energy company Aquamarine Power advising on the development of the Oyster wave energy converter.
Salter was appointed MBE in the 2004 Birthday Honours for services to engineering. In 2012 he received the Royal Academy of Engineering Sustained Achievement Award.
Salter's Duck.
While historic references to the power of waves do exist, the modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was begun in the 1970s by Stephen Salter, in response to the Oil Crisis. His 1974 invention became known as Salter's Duck or Nodding Duck, although it was officially referred to as the "Edinburgh Duck". In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity. According to sworn testimony before the House of Parliament, The UK Wave Energy programme was shut down on 19 March 1982, in a closed meeting. An analysis of Salter's Duck resulted in a miscalculation of the estimated cost of energy production by a factor of 10, an error which was only recently identified. Some wave power advocates believe that this error, combined with a general lack of enthusiasm for renewable energy in the 1980s (after oil prices fell), hindered the advancement of wave power technology.

Adria oil pipeline

Adria oil pipeline (, ; also known as Yugoslav Pipeline and JANAF pipeline) is a crude oil pipeline in Croatia, Serbia, and Hungary with branch lines to Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
History.
The idea of the Adria pipeline was first discussed in 1964 by Yugoslav officials. The plan proposed in October 1965 foresaw a pipeline with a capacity of about 10 million tonnes per annum to supply Yugoslav refineries in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Vojvodina in Serbia with a branch line to the Hungarian border or through Ljubljana to Graz in Austria. The project foresaw to supply refineries in Sisak, Lendava, Bosanski Brod, Novi Sad and Pančevo. In June 1966 it was published that the pipeline was to have a diameter of and that the first long section would lead from Bakar or Rijeka to Sisak. The annual capacity of the Bakar-Sisak section was scheduled to 17 million tonnes. From Sisak, the long northern branch was to be extend to the border town of Botovo, from the Hungarian pipeline between Nagykanizsa and Budapest. The long eastern branch was to be extend to Bosanski Brod on the Sava River, and from there for about to the Danubian port of Vukovar. A completion date for the Bosanski Brod-Vukovar section was set on 1 May 1968. In addition, a branch from Bosanski Brod to the Danubian port of Pančevo near Belgrade was foreseen. This proposal was supported Croatian authorities and INA oil company. Another proposal about a long pipeline from the port of Ploče through Sarajevo to Bosanski Brod and then to Vukovar, preferred by Bosnian and Serbian authorities and companies, was disapproved. 
In 1966, Czechoslovakia offered to participate in the construction of the northern branch of Adria pipeline by supplying pipes and equipment. This offer was accepted in July 1967. Early in June 1967, preliminary talks began between Yugoslav and Austrian experts about a Bakar-Vienna pipeline (via Hungary) with a total annual capacity of 22 million tonnes. Another proposal was about an extension of the planned Yugoslav-Hungarian section to Austria. At the same time, construction of the eastern branch from Bosanski Brod to Vukovar started. 
In 1968, the route from Bakar through Hungary to Bratislava was decided. On 7 May 1968, Czechoslovak signed a memorandum with Iran called for the supply of 15 to 20 million tonnes over a 10 year period, beginning in 1970. By August 1968 an agreement between the Yugoslav, Hungarian and Czechoslovak participants was reached on the joint construction of the Bakar-Sisak-Hungary pipeline. A joint enterprise was to be created for the construction and operation of the pipeline. The pipeline was to go into operation early in 1971.
At the end of 1968, Austria become tied into the Trieste-Ingolstadt pipeline and lost its interest to the Adria pipeline. Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland became more interested about the expansion of Druzhba pipeline and construction of the Trieste-Vienna-Budapest pipeline. Also disagreement between the Yugoslav companies rose as HENA and Energoinvest preferred the Ploče-Sarajevo-Bosanski Brod route. 
In 1968, a dispute was raised concerning the quality of the large-diameter pipes delivered by Czechoslovakia for the eastern branch of the pipeline. API-5Lx pipes with diameter of were produced by the NHG Kunčice rolling mill of Czechoslovakia. Yugoslav partners claimed that these pipes were not calibrated on the ends according to API specifications. In addition. handling with improper loading equipment and shipment between Bratislava and Osijek on improperly adapted ships resulted in damage to many pipe-ends, which meant that welding frequently could not be carried out on the site. This led to higher production costs. The Bosanski Brod–Vukovar section was put into trial operation on 29 April 1969.
In 1969, the Yugoslav oil company Naftagas (now Naftna Industrija Srbije), the Czechoslovak enterprise Hidrostav, and the United States engineering company Bechtel signed an agreement on joint engineering planning of the Adriatic link and the northern branch. In October 1969, it was agreed that the northern branch of Adria pipeline would be operational by the beginning of 1974. The total capacity was given as 17 million tonnes annually, with Yugoslavia receiving 10 million, Czechoslovakia 5 million and Hungary and Poland 2 million tonnes each. It was also agreed to extend the northern branch to Poland. 
In 1973, Yugoslavia's three biggest oil companies INA, Energoinvest and Naftagas agreed construction of the pipeline from Omišalj port near Rijeka to the main industrial centers around Zagreb and Belgrade with the northern branch of the pipeline to be connected with the Hungarian and Czechoslovak pipeline system, while the eastern branch to be connected with the Rumanian system. Each of the companies agreed to bear one third of the total costs. A joint committee (Jugoslavenski naftovod, later Jadranski naftovod) was established to managed construction and later the operation of the pipeline. The agreement between Yugoslavia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia was signed on 12 February 1974. The pipeline was to be constructed in two phases. In the initial phase, expected to be completed by the end of 1976, all pipelines and oil pools were to be constructed at Omišalj, and in the second phase by 1978 all other installations and storage tanks were to be completed to enable the unloading capacity of 34  million tonnes of crude oil annually. At this stage, the pipeline was expected to cost US$350 million, of which Yugoslavia was to provide $30 million, and Hungary and Czechoslovakia $25 million each. The rest of the cost were expected to be financed by the World Bank loan.
In 1975, the expected cost was increased up to $412 million. A new financing scheme was agreed according to which Kuwait was to provide $125 million, Libya $70 million, the World Bank $49 million, Hungary and Czechoslovakia $25 million each, and Yugoslavia $118 million. Construction was scheduled to begin in the spring of 1976, and the first phase, was to be finished in 1978.
The construction of the Adria pipeline started in 1984 and it became fully operational at the end of 1989 (alternative sources cite 1990). In 1991, as a result of the Croatian War of Independence and other Yugoslav wars, the operation of the Adria pipeline was stopped and the facilities were mothballed and maintained in operational condition by the transit countries. The northern branch of Adria pipeline was re-opened at the end of 1995 and used since then occasionally mainly in reverse mode.
Description.
The Adria pipeline starts at the Omišalj Oil Terminal. From Omišalj the main line runs to Sisak, while spur pipelines connects terminal and refinery in Urinj. In Sisak the northern and eastern branches are split. The norther branch runs further to Virje, where branch section runs to Lendava in Slovenia, and Gola, where the pipeline crosses Croatian–Hungarian border. It continues through Hungary up to the Duna refinery in Százhalombatta, where it is connected with the southern line of Druzhba and the Druzhba's branch between Hungary and Slovakia. The annual capacity of Hungarian section is 10 million tonnes of oil per annum. The maximum rated capacity in the Slovak section is at 3.68 million tonnes per year.
The eastern branch runs from Sisak to Slavonski Brod. From there, the branch section runs to Bosanski Brod in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the main line continues to Sotin at the Croatian–Serbian border. In Serbia, the pipeline runs to Novi Sad and further to Pančevo.
Further connections.
The Druzhba Adria project suggested the connection of Adria pipeline with the Druzhba pipeline. By this, Russia would have direct connection to the Omišalj harbor for its oil export. Due to objections for environmental reasons it was not yet realized. As an alternative, the combination of Druzhba Adria with the proposed Pan-European Pipeline has been suggested for transportation of Russian oil to Trieste.

He is a professor and was department chair from 2001-2009 at the University of Alabama. He was one of the editors of the quarterly periodical "Method & Theory in the Study of Religion 1997-2001". In 2005, McCutcheon was elected President of the Council of Societies for the Study of Religion (CSSR), headquartered at Rice University. He is the founder and series editor for Equinox Publishing's anthology series, "Critical Categories in the Study of Religion".
He has been noted for a controversy concerning methodology in the field of Religious Studies. This controversy centered on a rather polemical exchange between McCutcheon and Dr. Robert A. Orsi, who held a teaching position at Harvard University and Harvard Divinity School, with Orsi referring to McCutcheon's book, "The Discipline of Religion", as "chilling". Orsi also made the comment, "the assumption appears to be that the scholar of religion by virtue of his or her normative epistemology, theoretical acuity, and political knowingness, has the authority and the right to make the lives of others the objects of his or her scrutiny. He or she theorizes them." McCutcheon responded with a paper included in the Journal of the American Academy of Religion entitled, "It's a Lie. There's No Truth in It! It's a Sin!: On the Limits of the Humanistic Study of Religion and the Costs of Saving Others from Themselves."
His most recent editing project is a new monograph series, also with Equinox Press, entitled "Religion in Culture: Studies in Social Contest and Construction."

Albanian Basketball League

The Albanian Basketball League is a league competition featuring professional basketball clubs from Albania. It was founded in 1946 from the Albanian Basketball Association, several days after the latter was formed. It is the top level basketball league in Albanian from its foundation. The team with the most championships is B.C. Partizani Tirana with 33 championships.
The Albanian Basketball League consists of 12 professional basketball clubs in Albania and it's one of the oldest basketball competition in the Balkans having started in 1946. The sport rapidly grew in Albania and by the 70s almost every city and town had its own basketball club and basketball field. After communism fell many of the basketball clubs folded as many players left the country to play for foreign teams. The basketball attendance decreased and the popularity of this sport fell down worryingly. However, after 1993 basketball rose up again with many cities re-establishing their teams. Now in Albania there are twelve professional teams while there are plenty of amateur teams ready to enter the league.
Competition.
The members of the Albanian Basketball League are grouped in two divisions: A1 League and B2 League. Each division has six teams and they have to play four times against each other in two different phases during the regular season. In every phase a club plays each of the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. This makes a total of 20 games played per season in the regular season.
After the regular season ends the top four clubs qualify for the play-offs, where the team placed first faces the one placed fourth while the second and the third placed teams play each other. From these encounters qualifies the team that gets first two victories while games are played once home, once away until the two victories are reached. The teams that win their encounters qualify for the finals which are played in the clubs respective grounds, the game will once be played home and once away, dependng on the draw. The team that gets first the three victories is crowned as champion.
Clubs that win get two points that the ones that lose get one point. At the end of the regular season the bottom two clubs miss the play-offs. The bottom club gets relegated while the fifth placed club will play the second placed of the B2 League. The team that wins the play-out has the right to play in A1 League.

Ray Zone

Ray Zone (1947–2012) was an American film historian, author, artist, and pioneer in methods of converting flat images (in particular, comic books) into stereoscopic images.
"Starlog" called him the "King of 3-D Comics", and Artsy Planet called him the "3D King of Hollywood".
Biography.
Zone attributed his interest in 3D to having read "Mighty Mouse" comic books in 3D at the age of 6, in 1953. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1980s and began converting flat art to 3D images. He began working in comic books in 1983, and his early collaborations with Jack C. Harris and Steve Ditko drew the attention of Archie Goodwin, who recruited him to work with John Byrne on the 1990 "Batman 3-D", a full-length 3D graphic novella. Zone produced 3D adaptations of art for over 150 comic books, for clients such as Disney, Warner Bros and the Simpsons, and including stories by Alan Moore and Grant Morrison which were specifically written to accommodate stereoscopy.
An internationally recognized expert in all things 3-D, Zone had a special interest in stereoscopic cinema and Large Format 3-D (15/70) filmmaking. He created stereo conversions and stereoscopic images for a wide variety of clients in publishing, education, advertising, television and motion pictures. In 2006 Zone was the 3D Artist on the Tool album "10,000 Days", which won that year's Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. He received numerous awards for his 3-D work, among them a 1987 Inkpot Award from the San Diego Comic-Con for "Outstanding Achievement in Comic Arts", and
He was the author of "3D Filmmakers, Conversations with Creators of Stereoscopic Motion Pictures" (Scarecrow Press: 2005), "Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838 - 1952" (University Press of Kentucky: 2007), "3-DIY: Stereoscopic Moviemaking on an Indie Budget" (Focal Press: 2012), and "3-D Revolution: The History of Modern Stereoscopic Cinema" (University Press of Kentucky: 2012).
In 2008 Zone worked as 3D Supervisor on "Dark Country" with director/star Thomas Jane, and in 2010 as 3D Producer on "Brijes 3D," (Ithrax/SDA), the first animated 3D feature film made in Mexico.

Cranston Street Armory

The Cranston Street Armory is a historic building in Providence, Rhode Island. It was built in 1907 at a cost of $650,000.00. The architects were William R. Walker & Son and the buider was Michael J. Houlihan. The building was occupied by the Rhode Island National Guard from its opening until 1996. Since then, parts of the building have been used as film studios, and some of its offices occupied by the Rhode Island State Fire Marshal. The National Trust for Historic Preservation lists the Armory as one of "America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places." Its distinctive yellow bricks, crenellated turrets, and decorative stonework mark it as a historically significant building and neighborhood icon.
The armory was built with a steel-truss frame, with a large open central hall and two towers with a total of of space. The main hall alone is as wide as two football fields. After World War I, the armory was used by 243rd Coast Artillery, and in later years by the 43rd and 118th as well.
On account of its imposing presence, the Cranston Street Armory has lent its name to the surrounding area of Providence's West End, which is often known as the "Armory District." Several area businesses, among them the Armory Revival Company and Armory Properties, also take their name from this building.
The films Outside Providence and Underdog were filmed using the open areas within the Armory for bluescreen work, as well as exterior shots of adjacent areas.
The Armory was used for several years by the Rhode Island Interscholastic League to host indoor track and field meets including the Rhode Island state championships and the Brown Invitational track meet. Although the conditions within the Armory were not the greatest for producing quality times, the atmosphere during championship track meets was outstanding as teams circled the track and cheered on the performers. A well known meet occurred in 1980, when the Woonsocket High School Villa Novans surprisingly defeated the favorite, Bishop Hendricken Hawks, to win the Class A Championships with the last event of the evening. The Hawks went on to win the state championship the following week, but the excitement in the Class and state championships could not be measured.
Decline.
In 1981 structural problems were discovered that closed the main hall to public events. The National Guard however did not have the funds for the extensive repairs and upkeep required by the buildings age. 
As of 1986 the Cranston Street Armory was home to the following Rhode Island National Guard units:
About 1990 the tenant units were transferred to other armories. The Field Artillery units were moved to the Armory of Mounted Commands in Providence and the Military Police units were moved to the Warwick Armory in Warwick.
In 1996 the State of Rhode Island took over the property, and the National Guard moved out the following year. After the state passed tax incentives to encourage filming in Rhode Island the armory served a brief stint as a sound stage. Parts of the films Outside Providence and Underdog were shot in and around the armory. In 2004 a proposed bond issue to finance renovation and restoration of the armory was placed on the ballot and supported by the West Broadway Neighborhood Association, but did not pass. In recent years, the building has hosted car shows, inaugural balls, track meets and home shows, and currently houses the office of the state fire marshal, and storage space for other R.I. state agencies. Today the building is in desperate need of repair. A small part of the building on the Parade St. side is occupied by the State of Rhode Island Fire Marshal and Bomb Squad, the main hall is used for storage.
In 2014 Governor Chafee announced that the state would cut back on a renovation plan, and a state Senator proposed adding $3 million to the state budget for repairs.

Brian Evans (footballer)

Brian Clifford Evans (2 December 1942 – 26 February 2003) was a Welsh footballer who played as a winger in the Football League for Swansea City and Hereford United. He made a total of 397 senior appearances for Swansea (excluding Welsh Cup appearances), and was capped 7 times for Wales.
Career.
After being spotted playing for Abergavenny Thursdays, Evans joined Swansea City in July 1963 for a fee of £650. Over the following decade Evans helped the side win the Welsh Cup in 1966 and promotion to Division Three during the 1969–70 season. In August 1973, he was sold to Hereford United for £7,000 as manager Harry Gregg was forced to sell several players before he was allowed to sign new players. After leaving Hereford in 1975, Evans moved into non-league football with spells at Bath City, Llanelli, Haverfordwest County and Pontardawe Town.
International career.
Evans played for the Wales under-23 side and was also part of an FAW XI tour of Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Malaysia in 1971. He made his debut for the senior side on 13 October 1971 in a 3–0 win over Finland. He went on to make a further six appearances over the following two years, winning his final cap on 26 September 1973 in a 3–0 defeat to Poland.
Later life.
After retiring from playing he ran a painting and decoration business in Swansea. He died at the age of 60 after a short battle with cancer.

HAT-P-11b

HAT-P-11b (or Kepler-3b) is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star HAT-P-11. This planet was discovered by the transit method and submitted for publication on January 2, 2009.
This planet is located approximately away in the constellation of Cygnus, orbiting the 10th magnitude K-type star HAT-P-11. This planet was the smallest transiting planet known when first discovered, with a radius about 5 times that of Earth; but is more massive than Gliese 436 b at a true mass of 26 times that of Earth. This planet orbits about the same distance from the star as 51 Pegasi b is from 51 Pegasi, typical of transiting planets. However, the orbit of this planet is eccentric, at around 0.198, unusually high for hot Neptunes. HAT-P-11b's orbit is also highly inclined, with a tilt of approximately 103 degrees relative to its star's rotation.
The HAT-P-11 system was within the field of view of the Kepler spacecraft.
Its radial velocity is drifting and this may be a result of an as-yet-undiscovered planet in the system.
The planet fits models for 90% heavy elements. Expected temperature is 878 ± 15K.
Actual temperature must await calculations of secondary transit.

<doc id="21353102" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21353102" title="Siahan Range">
Siahan Range

The Siahan Range is a mountain range in the central part of Balochistan Province of southwestern Pakistan. The Siahan Range is primarily made up of limestone and sandstone and was formed when the north western Indian Plate collided with the Eurasian Plate.
Geography.
The total length of the Siahan Range from Shireza to the western frontier is about . The highest point of the range is on the east and is Razak (6758 ft): other peaks are Mughal Pabb (5979 ft) and Choto-e-Jik (5874 ft); westward the range decreases in height to about 5000 ft.
Sub-ranges and ridges.
The Siahan Range, from the term applied to the western extremity of the range, is the name which may be given to the long ridge which separate Kharan from the valley of the Rakshan River and eventually fades westward into the hills of Iranian Balochistan.
The range has never been thoroughly explored. It consists of two ridges:
It is from this range that the name for the whole mass has been taken. It forms the main ridge at the western extremity of the mass, but at the eastern end, a more southerly range predominates.
The eastern end of the range is variously known merely as "Band", or as the Kharan-rakshan Lath, while on the west and north of Panjgur it is known as the Koh-e-Sabz. The Koh-e-Sabz is only well defined to the west of the Korkian Pass, from which place it gradually rises to a height of nearly 5400 ft before it is crossed by the defile known as the Tank-e-Grawag. On the other hand, the Kharan- Rakshan Lath descends gradually toward Jang-ja-e-gajiun in Panjgur, and forms the hilly country between the latter place and the Koh-e-Sabz. It follows, therefore, that a traveler to the Kharan plain on the north, from the part of the Rakshan basin which lies to the east of the Korkian Pass, must cross two main ridges, while immediately north of Panjgur he must traverse three, viz. the hilly country consisting of the extremity of the eastern main range and lying between Panjgur and the Koh-e-sabz; the Koh-e-Sabz and the Siahan or Siahan Koh proper.
The northern ridge between Washuk and the valley of Palantak torrent is known as the Cher Dem in the Washuk Niabat of the Kharan District. Its height is about 5000 ft. at its western end a well known peak Hetai, which lies to the west of the Tank-e-zurrati through which the Mashkel River breaks northward to the Hamun Mashkel.
Geology.
Geologically the Siahan Range has never been fully studied but its general aspect is abrupt, rugged and broken. The Koh-e-sabz portion is composed of shale and volcanic rock, contorted in many places into fantastic shapes with synclinal and anticlinal curves.
The shale which lies throughout in perpendicular parallel layers or at a slight angle to its base, gives the hill a very sharp and jagged appearance, but though difficult they are not unscalable, very steep and precipitous escarpments being rare and generally limited to the sides. The range being on consolidated upheaval, there are no valleys ascents and descents from one ridge to another being made by following the rivulets.
Drainage.
The Rakshan tributary of the Mashkel River carries off all the drainage from the southern slopes. On the north a number of hill torrents descend, either to lose themselves in the Kharan Plain or to join the Mashkel River. Some of the more important are the Gujjar, the Regintak, the Gresha Kaur, the Palantak, the Pillin, the Bibi Lohri and the Barshonki.
Of the two gorges already mentioned the Tank-e-Grawag lies in the Koh-e-Sabz and the Tank-e-Zurrati in the northern ridge of the Siahan Koh. The former is so termed from the reeds called Grawag which grow here in great abundance. There is also a small patch of cultivation where a few date palms grow at the point where it makes its first turn. It is six miles in length and is easily passable when the river is low, but is subject to great and violent floods. The latter is just over eight miles long and of medium width, being nowhere less than 80 yards and generally nearly 150. The perpendicular cliffs which enclose it are about 200 feet in height. Quicksands exist at some of the fords and there is perennial water in both defiles.
People.
The range possesses no permanent inhabitants; among the nomads who pasture their flocks on it are the Muhammad Hasnis, Nasrois, Bullozais, Sopaks and Hajizais of the Rakshan valley and a few people from Kuhak called Siahani. Some nomads from Kharan Plain also visit it, chiefly Rikis and Kuchai Siahpad and Taghapi Rakshanis.
Footpaths and trails.
The range is crossed by numerous footpaths and trails, which are used by Balochistani people, including the Simmij, Sabzap, Kasag, Miani, Sorani, and Sechi.
Commencing from the east the passes chiefly used by people are the Zard, to the northwest of Shireza; the Paliaz north of Nag-e-Kalat; and the Sagar-e-Kandag and Korkian passes on the road from Panjgur to Washuk. The Hetai is an important pass north of Tank-e-Grawag, on the road from Panjgur to Dehgwar in Kharan.
Flora.
The range is predominantly desert habitats. Many of the seasonally torrential river channels contain Tamarix, and some Asafoetida. The date palm ("Phoenix dactylifera") flourishes in oasis and irrigated locations.

Maddale

The Maddale () is a percussion instrument from Karnataka, India. It is the primary rhythmic accompaniment in a Yakshagana ensemble along with Chande. Maddale used in Yakshagana looks similar to mridangam but is markedly different in structure, acoustics, playing techniques and the rhythm system (Yakshagana Tala).  Unlike Mrudangam or Tabla, Maddale produces tonic (shruti swara) when played either on rim or on ink. The traditional variety of Maddale was 30 cm long, had 8 inch drum head and produced loud sound. Maddale is available in more than three different variations.
History.
Maddale belongs to mridangam family of drums and hence shares the history of similar drums. Its drum head is similar to tabla and the drum itself is similar to pakhavaj. Thus it is likely that maddale is a variation of pakhavaj and mrudangam. Over the years, the Maddale evolved to be made of different kinds of wood and for higher octave, and today, its body is constructed from wood of the jackfruit tree among other woods like kakke, baine, hunaalu. Its use has evolved with the development of Yakshagana and Yakshaganic fingering and hand techniques have been developed. Use of palm produces a sound that is somewhat a mixture of pakhawaj and mridangam.
Physical components.
The maddale is a double-sided drum whose body is usually made using a hollowed piece of jackfruit wood about half an inch thick. This body is called Goodu. The two open ends of the drum are covered with a goat skin leather and laced to each other with leather straps around the circumference of drum. These straps stretched to tightly hold the drum heads on either side of the drum body, allowing them to resonate when struck. Drum head on the left is slightly larger (bass side). One side produces bass another treble. The drum head is known as "muchchige".
The bass drum head is known as the "eda muchchige" and the drum head is known as the "bala muchchige". The right drum head is similar to tabla drum head but differes slightly creating a major tonal difference. Maddale unlike Mrudangam or Tabla produces tonic when playing on rim and on ink. The left drum head produces lower pitched bass sounds. The right drum head has a circular disk in the center called "karne" causing the drum to produce harmonic tones. The left drum is smeared with a tuning paste made from ash and rice called "bona", before performance to dampen the tone and to produce bass sound.
Methods of use.
Maddale is tuned to the tonic of the Yakshagana singer before performance. A wooden peg is sometimes used to tighten the leather straps. Two major strokes are called Gumpu and Chapu. Playing on the rim is called Chapu this is used for tuning. Playing on the ink to produce a more resonating sound is called Gumpu.

HD 173416 b is an extrasolar planet located approximately 440 light years away in the constellation of Lyra, orbiting the 6th magnitude G-type giant star HD 173416. This is planet has at least 2.7 times the mass of Jupiter and was discovered on January 10, 2009 by Liu "et al." HD 173416 b orbits at 1.16 AU from the star. However despite the fact that the planet orbits 16% further from the star than Earth does from the Sun, it has orbital period of only 323.6 days, compared to 365.25 days for Earth. This inverse relationship is caused by the parent star having twice the mass of our Sun, which increases the strength of its gravitional field. This evidence implies that when this star was on the main sequence, it was an A-type star.

Arjo Wiggins

Arjo Wiggins is a leading producer of paper products. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and used to be a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but is now owned by Worms & Cie.
History.
The Company's origins go back to 1761 when Buckland Mill in Dover in Kent commenced operations.
Meanwhile in France, in the middle of the 20th century there were four competing paper mills that manufactured sophisticated paper products with high added value, especially security papers (banknotes, passports, etc.). A joint merger plan was drawn up in 1954 and led to the formation of the first French paper-manufacturing group: ARJOMARI. The name of the group came from the first two letters of the names of the paper mills participating in the merger: Arches, Johannot, Marais, Rives.
In 1890 Buckland Mill was bought by "Wiggins Teape" a business formed by Edward Wiggins and Henry Teape when they incorporated their paper milling business some 40 years earlier.
In 1970 the Company was acquired by BAT Industries who went on to acquire "Appleton Papers" of the US in 1978. The business expanded rapidly in the 1980s as it exploited the market in carbonless paper. In 1989 the UK and US paper businesses were demerged from BAT Industries and integrated to form "Wiggins Teape Appleton". In 1991 it merged with Arjomari-Prioux of France to form "Arjo Wiggins Appleton". Its distribution business was demerged in 2000 as "Antalis".
It was acquired by Worms & Cie in 2000.

Casa Basso is an Italian restaurant located on the eastern end of Long Island in Westhampton, New York. It is the site of the Theophilus Brouwer House. The property including both Casa Basso and the house has been designated a Westhampton Hamlet Heritage Resource, as it includes ruins of the pottery studio and kiln of Theophilus Anthony Brouwer.
History.
The Location.
The property is bordered by Montauk Highway to the front and the Beaver Dam Creek to the back. It was originally purchased in the late 19th century by American artist Theophilus Brower. As a young man, Brower traveled and studied art in Spain and Italy, and when he returned to Long Island, he built a castle like one he remembered near Seville. After completing the castle, he adorned the property with romantic sculptures which include two twelve foot swordsmen, a Roman lion, and a Psyche. This man-made property would later become known as Pinewold Park and be open for public viewing.
Restaurant.
Casa Basso was opened as a restaurant for the first time in 1928 by New York restaurateur M.L. Basso and his family. The Basso family successfully operated the restaurant until 1958 when it was purchased by Valerio "Rene" Mondini. In 1986, Mondini sold the restaurant to his longtime apprentice, Bejto Bracovic, who became the new owner and executive chef.

Elmhirst was also a first cousin of Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott, who became, after her wedding to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester and an aunt-by-marriage of Elizabeth II.
Early life.
Montagu Douglas Scott was born on Tuesday 16 June 1908, the second child and first daughter for Lord Herbert Montagu Douglas Scott, son of William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch and Lady Louisa Hamilton, and Marie Josephine Edwards, daughter of James Andrew Edwards and Kate Marion Agnes MacNamara.
Marriage and family.
On 1 November 1927, at the age of 19, Marian married Colonel Andrew Ferguson (10 October 1899 - 4 August 1966), in London, England. The couple had two children:
Her first son, John, was ten years old when he died from peritonitis. Her second son, Ronald, was the father of Sarah, Duchess of York, and the maternal grandfather of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie of York. Ronald Ferguson died on 16 March 2003 from a heart attack, after a lengthy battle with skin and prostate cancers. 
On Wednesday, 30 October 1968, a little more than two years after the death of her husband, Andrew Ferguson (4 August 1966), Marian married Sir Thomas Elmhirst, widower of the late Katherine Black, thus becoming "Lady Elmhirst". Sir Thomas died on 6 November 1982.
Death.
Lady Elmhirst died on Wednesday, 11 December 1996, at Dummer, Hampshire, in her 88th year. She was predeceased by two husbands, Andrew Ferguson (4 August 1966) and Sir Thomas Elmhirst (6 November 1982), and her first-born son John Ferguson (d. 1939). At the time of her death, she was survived by her son, Major Ronald Ferguson, five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

<doc id="21353314" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21353314" title="Perfluorinated compound">
Perfluorinated compound

A perfluorinated compound (PFC) is an organofluorine compound containing only carbon-fluorine bonds (no C-H bonds) and C-C bonds but also other heteroatoms. PFCs have properties that represent a blend of fluorocarbons (containing only C-F and C-C bonds) and the parent functionalized organic species. For example, perfluorooctanoic acid functions as a carboxylic acid but with strongly altered surfactant and hydrophobic characteristics.
Applications.
Many perfluorinated compounds are useful. For example, fluorosurfactants powerfully reduce surface tension by concentrating at the liquid-air interface due to the lipophobicity of fluorocarbons, due to the polar functional group added to the fluorocarbon chain. Other groups or atoms for fluorocarbon based compounds the oxygen atom incorporated into an ether group for anesthetics, and the chlorine atom for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). In a sharp contrast to true fluorocarbons, the chlorine atom produces a chlorine radical which degrades ozone. Fluorosurfactants are widely used in the production of teflon and related fluorinated polymers. They have also been used to confer hydrophobic, stain-resisting properties to fabrics. 
Classes of PFCs by functional group.
Representative members of this large family of compounds are listed below. Also numerous are compounds that contain many fluoride centers but also some hydrogen, e.g., trifluoroethanol.
Perfluoroalcohols.
Perfluorinated alcohols are unstable with respect to dehydrofluorination.
Perfluorinated aryl borates.
2]n)
PFOS and POSF are included within Annex B of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.
Polyfluorinated compounds, such as fluorotelomers, can serve as precursors that degrade to form perfluorinated carboxylic acids, such as PFOA and PFNA.
Polyvinylidene fluoride ([CH2CF2]n).
Environmental and health concerns.
Despite the presence of some natural fluorocarbons such as tetrafluoromethane, which has been reported in rocks, man-made fluorocarbons are potent greenhouse gases.
Certain fluorocarbons tend to bioaccumulate, since they are extremely stable and can be stored in the bodies of both humans and animals. Examples of fluorocarbons include PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate), frequently present in water resistant textiles and sprays conferring water resistant properties to textiles. Data from animal studies of PFOA indicate that it can cause several types of tumors and neonatal death and may have toxic effects on the immune, liver, and endocrine systems. Data on the human health effects of PFOA are however sparse.
The fluorocarbon, PFOA and PFOS have both been subject for numerous investigations by the EU and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding them being harmful to the environment.

HD 7924 b is an extrasolar planet located approximately 54 light years away in the constellation of Cassiopeia, orbiting the 7th magnitude K-type main sequence (slightly metal poor) star HD 7924. It was published on January 28, 2009 and is the second planet discovered in the constellation Cassiopeia. (The first planet discovered in this constellation is HD 17156 b, which was published on April 14, 2007).
Super-Earth.
HD 7924 b is a super-Earth exoplanet with a minimum mass 9.2 times that of Earth and takes only about 129.5 hours to orbit the star, at an average distance of . When HD 7924 b was discovered in 2009, it was one of only eight planets known with a minimum mass less than 10 Earths. Also a super-Earth discovery makes 2009 the fifth year in a row since 2005 to have super-Earth planets discovered.
Characteristics.
While the radius of HD 7924 b is unknown, depending on its composition, it will be between 1.4–6 times the diameter of the Earth. It is unknown whether this planet is rocky or gaseous. Since the true mass of this planet is not known, it might be gaseous if the true mass is considerably more than minimum mass. If the true mass is near the minimum mass of 9.2 ME, then this planet could be rocky.

Lindeberg's condition

In probability theory, Lindeberg's condition is a sufficient condition (and under certain conditions also a necessary condition) for the central limit theorem (CLT) to hold for a sequence of independent random variables. Unlike the classical CLT, which requires that the random variables in question have finite mean and variance and be both independent and identically distributed, Lindeberg's CLT only requires that they have finite mean and variance, satisfy Lindeberg's condition, and be independent. It is named after the Finnish mathematician Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.
Statement.
Let formula_1 be a probability space, and formula_2, be "independent" random variables defined on that space. Assume the expected values formula_3 and variances formula_4 exist and are finite. Also let formula_5
If this sequence of independent random variables formula_6 satisfies the Lindeberg's condition:
for all formula_8, where 1{…} is the indicator function; or using another formulation of Lindeberg's condition,
for all formula_8, where the integral is a Lebesgue integral over the set formula_11; then the central limit theorem holds, i.e. the random variables
converge in distribution to a standard normal random variable as formula_13
Lindeberg's condition is sufficient, but not in general necessary (i.e. the inverse implication does not hold in general).
However, if the sequence of independent random variables in question satisfies
then Lindeberg's condition is both sufficient and necessary, i.e. it holds if and only if the result of central limit theorem holds.
Interpretation.
Because the Lindeberg condition implies formula_15 as formula_16, it guarantees that the contribution of any individual random variable formula_6 (formula_18) to the variance formula_19 is arbitrarily small, for sufficiently large values of formula_20.

Laminaria digitata

Laminaria digitata is a large brown alga in the family Laminariaceae, also known by the common name Oarweed. It is found in the sublittoral zone of the northern Atlantic Ocean.
Description.
"L. digitata" is a tough, leathery, dark brown seaweed that grows to two or three metres. The holdfast which anchors it to the rock is conical and has a number of spreading root-like protrusions called rhizoids. The stipe or stalk is flexible and oval in cross section. The blade is large and shaped like the palm of a hand with a number of more or less regular finger-like segments. This seaweed can be distinguished from the rather similar "Laminaria hyperborea" by being darker in colour and having a shorter stipe that does not easily snap when bent.
Distribution.
"L digitata" occurs in the north west Atlantic from Greenland south to Cape Cod and in the north east Atlantic from northern Russia and Iceland south to France. It is common round the coasts of the British Isles except for much of the east coast of England.
Ecology.
"L digitata" is found mostly on exposed sites on shores in the lower littoral where it may form extensive meadows and can be the dominant algal species. It has a fairly high intrinsic growth rate compared to other algae, 5.5% per day, and a carrying capacity of about 40 kg wet weight per square meter. It may reach lengths of about 4 m. It overlaps to a small degree in distribution with "Fucus serratus" and "Alaria esculenta". It is highly susceptible to grazing by sea urchins, among other species. It has low and high light limitation values of about 5 and 70 W per square meter respectively. Its distribution is also limited by salinity, wave exposure, temperature, desiccation and general stress. These and other attributes of the alga are summarized in the publications listed below.
Uses.
"L digitata" was traditionally used as a fertiliser and spread on the land. In the 18th century it was burnt to extract the potash it contained for use in the glass industry. In the 19th century it was used for the extraction of iodine. Both these uses died out when cheaper sources for these products became available. It is still used as an organic fertiliser but also for the extraction of alginic acid, the manufacture of toothpastes and cosmetics, and in the food industry for binding, thickening and moulding. It is used in Japan and China for making dashi, a soup stock, and for other culinary purposes.
Historically, the dried stalks of "L digitata", called "sea-tangle tents" were used as an abortifacient and for inducing labour.

Essex County Prosecutor's Office

The Essex County Prosecutor's Office (ECPO) is the largest and busiest county prosecutor’s office in the State of New Jersey. It consists of approximately 140 assistant prosecutors (attorneys at law), 160 detectives licensed to carry arms, and 125 support staff.
ECPO presently processes between 16,000 and 20,000 adult defendants charged with criminal acts per year. In addition, between 3,500 and 5,000 juveniles are processed each year through delinquency proceedings. Most of these defendants are arrested and charged by local or county-level law enforcement agencies, but ECPO also originates charges against defendants through its own investigatory units, and via direct indictment by the Essex County Grand Jury (i.e., charges issued directly by the grand jury and not prior to grand jury review). Between 5,000 and 6,000 adult defendants are indicted in Essex County each year. Essex County currently accounts for about 18% of all criminal (felony) cases referred to county prosecutors' offices in New Jersey. Approximately 35% of the state’s homicides and 14% of sexual assaults occur in Essex.
The Essex County Prosecutor.
The position of Essex County Prosecutor was established by the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. The Prosecutor serves as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer in the county. County Prosecutors in New Jersey are appointed by the Governor for a term of five years, and must be affirmed by the State Senate. They are not elected to office, as with equivalent positions (e.g., District Attorney or State's Attorney) in other states. County Prosecutors in New Jersey may be reappointed without term limit. The daily operations of the Office of the Essex County Prosecutor are funded mostly through tax revenues collected by Essex County and budgeted by the Board of Chosen Freeholders, with additional sums garnered from crime forfeitures and from grants made by State and federal agencies.
History.
In 1776, the State of New Jersey ratified its first Constitution (superseded by later Constitutions in 1844 and 1947). Under this Constitution, the elected Governor appointed an Attorney General to enforce the laws of the State. The Attorney General in turn appointed deputies for the various counties, including Essex, to enforce the criminal laws on behalf of the local populace. In 1822, the New Jersey General Assembly passed an act authorizing a more independent Prosecutor of Pleas for each county, to be appointed by the Court of Quarter Session once every five years. A few years later, the Governor was given the authority to appoint each county’s Prosecutor of Pleas.
On February 20, 1829, Amzi Dodd became the first governor-appointed Prosecutor of Pleas for Essex County. The earliest record of a prosecution by Prosecutor Dodd involves “a nuisance in suffering the water to stagnate and become offensive in the old burying ground” in Newark.
The first Prosecutor of Pleas worked alone, but by 1877 the Prosecutor required the help of a First Assistant. As Essex County grew and matters became more complex, the Office of the Prosecutor grew in size. By 1922, Essex County Prosecutor John O. Bigelow employed 28 men, including three Assistant Prosecutors, two Detective Captains, two Lieutenants, and various detectives and clerks. In the 1920s and 30’s, cases involving gambling, organized crime and official corruption were growing in number. In October 1935, the nationally-known organized crime figure Dutch Schultz was shot at the Palace Chop House in Newark. Although the prime suspect was found hanged soon after the incident, the Office continued its investigation and identified Schultz’s real shooter who pled guilty to the murder in 1940.
By 1945, the Office still had only three Assistant Prosecutors, despite a growing number of murder and gambling cases. In 1951, Prosecutor Edward Gaulkin gained attention by successfully prosecuting four men charged with conspiracy, extortion and bribery in the Newark milk scandal case. In 1959, New Jersey Governor Robert B. Meyner nominated Brendan T. Byrne of West Orange as the 25th Prosecutor of Essex County. Prosecutor (and later Governor) Byrne served the Office until 1967. By 1962, there were 16 Assistant Prosecutors, most of whom were part-time employees. Shortly thereafter, the first female Assistant Prosecutor was appointed. Also during Byrne’s tenure, the “Charlie Squad” was formed, a name coined after members of the public were urged to report illegal gambling by calling a dedicated phone number.
Shortly after Prosecutor Byrne left the Office in 1967, the City of Newark experienced a violent week-long civil disturbance, which heralded long-term social and economic change in Essex County. These transformations challenged future Prosecutors to respond to changing patterns of crime, including increased violent crime rates and increased narcotics-related crime. By 1973, the legal staff numbered 63 lawyers, all full-time. County Investigators were increasingly selected from the ranks of experienced local police officers. Under Prosecutor George Schneider (Prosecutor from 1981 to 1986), the number of Assistant Prosecutors exceeded 100. Increasing resources were also dedicated to special squads. The Homicide Squad was expanded and a Narcotics Section, which at first was a joint task force with the Sheriff’s Office, was created. Eventually specialized units were established in Child Abuse, Sex Assault, Arson, Domestic Violence, Megan’s Law, Gangs, and Economic Crime and Corruption.
In 1986, Governor Thomas Kean appointed the first African-American Prosecutor in Essex County (and only the second in the State of New Jersey), Herbert H. Tate, Jr. Computerization of the Office was begun and continued in stages throughout the terms of Prosecutor Tate and his successor, Prosecutor Clifford J. Minor. Also during this time, ECPO also established a Victim Witness Advocacy Office to help crime victims and witnesses cope with the disruption that crime and participation in the criminal justice system can bring.
In January, 1998, the first female Prosecutor, Patricia Hurt, was appointed by Governor Christie Todd Whitman. Prosecutor Hurt's tenure was affected by allegations of managerial and fiscal irregularities, and in July 1999, Governor Whitman dismissed Hurt and appointed Acting Prosecutor Donald Campolo from the State Division of Criminal Justice. A variety of other personnel from the State Attorney General's Office helped Campolo oversee ECPO operations for several years. However, in 2003, N.J. Governor James McGreevey appointed Paula T. Dow as Acting Prosecutor and effectively ended State oversight of the Office's daily functioning. In June, 2005, Governor Richard Codey swore Dow to the office of Essex County Prosecutor.
Recent developments.
Since the year 2000, the Essex County Prosecutor's Office has responded to increased auto theft, narcotics and youth gang activity through the formation of special task forces in conjunction with federal, state and multi-state law enforcement agencies. During this time, ECPO also completed a second generation of computerization complete with e-mail and Internet access and increased its outreach to the public through its newly established Community Justice Program and its public web site. ECPO also established a fatal vehicle collision investigation unit, and a program to assure humane treatment and accurate evidence collection from the victims of sexual assault.
To respond to increased incidence of witness harassment by street gangs since 2002, ECPO has stepped up its witness protection efforts, and has opened a modern crime scene office to replace a small, outdated facility. The new facility features a forensic processing room, digital photo processing room and a drying chamber designed to process and package blood-soaked evidence. Its computer system is linked to the N.J. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) to identify and match fingerprint evidence. Computer software allows detectives to visually reconstruct crime scenes. In addition to investigating homicides, shootings and sex crimes, the ECPO Crime Scene Unit is able to assist county police departments in burglaries and other criminal investigations.
Also during Prosecutor Dow's tenure, the process of handling most criminal cases after arrest and bail-setting was revised from a "horizontal" structure involving separate departments handling initial evaluation ("screening"), grand jury presentation, and trial or plea negotiation, to a "vertical" structure where one team of assistant prosecutors and support staff handles a case from start to finish. By early 2008, the "vertical trial units" handled most cases, although some cases continue to be handled partly or entirely by the special investigatory units dedicated to arson, sexual assault, domestic violence, narcotics, economic corruption and gang-related cases.
High Profile Cases.
The Essex County Prosecutor's Office has been involved in a variety of high-profile cases that gained national attention over the past twenty five years. In 1985, Kelly Michaels, a child care worker at the Wee Care Nursery School in Maplewood, NJ was arrested on allegations of sexually abusing children. The Essex County Prosecutor's Office helped to investigate the case and brought forth an indictment against Ms. Michaels, setting the stage for a trial. In 1988, the trial jury found Ms. Michaels guilty. However, the Appellate Division of the N.J. Superior Court overturned this verdict citing to a variety of improper prosecutorial practices, and required a new trial. After the N.J. Supreme Court affirmed this decision in 1994, ECPO dropped the indictment against Ms. Michaels.
In 1989, a sexual assault case was brought by ECPO against four high school athletes from Glen Ridge, NJ, who were convicted in 1993 for victimizing a 17 year-old mentally retarded woman. Three were convicted of aggravated sexual assault, and the fourth was convicted on one count of conspiracy. This case was the subject of a popular book, a TV movie, and an episode on the TV show “Law & Order.”
In April, 1999, during Prosecutor Hurt's tenure, the ECPO participated in the investigation of the shooting death of Orange, NJ Police Officer Joyce Carnegie. Both ECPO and the local police were criticized for the arrest of two suspects, the first alleged to have been held wrongly because of the failure to interview a key alibi witness, and to have been physically mistreated while in custody. A second suspect, Earl Faison, died while in the custody of local police. Five Orange Police Officers were later indicted by a federal grand jury and convicted for violating Faison's civil rights. Another suspect, Condell Woodson, pled guilty to Carnegie's murder and was sentenced to life in prison in June, 1999.
In January, 2000, a fire occurred in the Boland Hall dormitory of Seton Hall University in South Orange, NJ that caused the deaths of three students and the injuries of 58 students. Two University students were charged with murder and a variety of other counts after being indicted by the Essex County Grand Jury in 2003. In 2007, after years of detailed investigation, Joseph LePore and Sean Ryan were sentenced to five years in prison under a plea agreement. Some local commentators criticized Prosecutor Dow regarding her Office's handling of the case, citing delays and the fact that murder charges had been dropped. However, there were no direct witnesses, and all evidence in this case was forensic, circumstantial or hearsay in nature.
In January, 2003, the mumified remains of 7-year old Faheem Williams were found by an ECPO detective in the basement of an apartment rented by Sherry Murphy, cousin of the dead child's mother. Two related children were found there alive but in a malnourished state. In September, 2005, Ms. Murphy plead guilty to charges of aggravated assault, criminal restraint and endangering the welfare of a child. Ms. Murphy's son Wesley also plead to a reckless endangerment charge for the "wrestling" incident during which Faheem Williams died, some four months before being found.

Ringgold-Carroll House

The Ringgold-Carroll House (also known as the DACOR Bacon House and John Marshall House) is an historic home, located at 1801 F St Northwest, Washington, D.C. 
History.
It was built in 1825 for Tench Ringgold, who was part of a three-member team in charge of restoring public buildings in the District of Columbia, following the War of 1812. 
From 1832-1833, Chief Justice John Marshall resided with Ringgold in the house.
In 1835, the house was sold, and a number of prominent people have since lived in the house, including William Thomas Carroll, a clerk at the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Melville Fuller, Senator Joseph Medill McCormick, and Congressman Robert Low Bacon. The Diplomatic and Consular Officers Retired (DACOR) now occupy the house, which is only open to the public on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays from 2:30 - 4:30 p.m. as the "Ringgold Museum".

Saccharina latissima

Saccharina latissima is a brown algae (class Phaeophyceae), of the family Laminariaceae. It is also known by the common name sea belt. It is found in the north east Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea south to Galicia in Spain. It is not found in the Bay of Biscay but is common round the coasts of the British Isles. The species is found at sheltered rocky seabeds.
Description.
"S. latissima" is a yellowish brown colour with a long narrow, undivided blade that can grow to long and wide. The central band is dimpled while the margins are smoother with a wavy edge. The frond is secured to the rock in the intertidal and sublittoral zones by a claw-like holdfast and a short, pliable, cylindrical stipe.
Ecology.
"S. latissima" is an ecologically important system. It is a primary producer, delivering plant material to the coastal food web. The three-dimensional forests also serve as a habitat for animals, resulting in a high biodiversity. Fish, shellfish and other animals get food and hiding places witin these forests.
Threats.
In 2004, scientists reported a loss in sugar kelp at 80% of the locations in the Skagerrak and 40% of the locations at the West coast of Norway. The reasons for this loss are not fully understood, but the increase in ocean temperature, high levels of nutrients and the reduction in animal species feeding off the filamentous algae are suggested as the most likely reasons.

" Clause 50 (1) The King shall appoint a Privy Council to provide him with advice. The Privy Council shall be composed of such people whom the King shall see fit to call to his Council."
Membership.
Members of the Privy Council are appointed by the King of Tonga who is its Chairmen. The Council has 3 types of members:
The Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General are automatically members of the Privy Council. The constitution doesn't set a limit on the number of members who sit on the Council and this is left to the decision of the Monarch.
Judicial functions.
The King in Privy Council has the authority to make appointments to most posts in the judicial branch of government. These include:
The Council also contains a Judicial Committee, composed of the Lord Chancellor, The Attorney General, the Lord Chief Justice and five Law Lords, and called the Judicial Appointments and Discipline Panel. The Judicial Committee advithe King on the exercise of his judicial powers" and "investigate[s complaints against judges".
The King in Privy Council is the final court of appeal for cases dealing with hereditary estates and titles.
Legislative functions.

Coley Building

The Coley Building was a historic two-story commercial building in Mobile, Alabama. It began as a one-story Federal style masonry structure in 1836. It was the last 19th century building to survive on its city block. The block, situated between the streets of St. Francis, Royal, Water, and St. Michael, was a center for many of Mobile's brokerage firms prior to the American Civil War. The building was seized by the Confederate government during the war from a suspected Union collaborator. It was enlarged and remodeled in the 1870s, with the addition of a second floor and the application of a Beaux-Arts-influenced cast iron facade.
The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 22, 1982. It was demolished in 2003 to make way for a parking deck to serve the RSA Battle House Tower, located across the street. The cast iron architectural details were saved by Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) and later restored by Robinson Iron of Alexander City, Alabama. The front facade of the building was then rebuilt and grafted onto the modern parking garage in 2006.

Posted Workers Directive

The EU Posted Workers Directive (96/71/EC) is an EU directive concerned with the free movement of workers within the European Union. It makes an exception to the Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations 1980, which ordinarily requires that workers are protected by the law of the member state in which they work.
After a controversial set of decisions by the European Court of Justice, the Directive has come under criticism for reducing rights of posted workers and undermining the rights of workers in a home nation.
Overview.
The Directive aims to clarify competing claims of competence in the case of staff being sent abroad by their employer for a project (posting), between the rules governing labour relations in the country of origin of the employing service provider and the country where the work is actually carried out (but where the staff is not normally based). If the laws of the country where the work is actually being carried out applied even for short stays, a company wishing to offer its services in the whole of the EU would have to be aware of 27 different sets of rules. This would be a burden in particular for SMEs which would discourage them from taking advantage of the EU's Internal Market. To counter this phenomenon, the European Court of Justice has developed a balancing mechanism on the basis of the Treaty that determines which country's rules apply in a given situation. However, this case-by-case approach generates legal uncertainty which is tackled by this Directive.
In order to protect workers from one EU country who are sent by their employer to carry out work in another temporarily, the Directive provides that a 'hard core' of rules of the host country (country of destination) needs to be observed. 
The Directive was first adopted in 1996.
The directive applies where,
The member state hosting a posted worker must ensure he is protected by the minimum standards in article 3(1). These are,
However, these limited set of rights must also been read within the context of TFEU art 56 (ex TEC art 49) on the freedom of establishment, and also the right to freedom of association under the European Convention on Human Rights article 11 and the EU Race Equality Directive. In this context there is the abovementioned mechanism of 'justified restrictions for the protection of essential requirements in the general interest', that the Court of Justice of the European Union has developed on the basis of the Treaty. Where the Directive does not apply, this mechanism remains decisive.
Case law.
In 2007, the European Court of Justice chose to give two decisions, whose effect appears to suggest that employers are only required to pay their workers the rate they would receive in their home country, provided this matches minimum wages and working conditions in the country they are posted to.
2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes.
The Directive came to prominence during the 2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes after British workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery in North Killingholme, North Lincolnshire claimed that they were being undercut by skilled foreign labour when the Italian construction contractor IREM appointed several hundred European (mainly Italian and Portuguese) contractors on the site at a time of high unemployment in the local and global economy. The action attracted considerable media interest. However, this question is not handled by the Directive. It is a question of the right to free movement for services itself, which is handled directly by the Treaty itself, since the contractor wished to use its own staff rather than hiring external subcontractors.
Professor Michelle Everson of Birkbeck, University of London, writing in the Guardian noted at the time, a possible conflict between Article 56 TFEU and Article 45 TFEU in light of decisions of the European Court of Justice. The decisions in question, ruling in relation to the Posting of Workers Directive meant that service providers only have to adhere to the essentials such as minimum pay and health & safety under Article 56, whereas established organisations are required, under Article 45 TFEU, to comply with other matters, such as collective bargaining agreements.

<doc id="21353733" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21353733" title="Coronary steal">
Coronary steal

Coronary steal (with its symptoms termed cardiac steal syndrome) is a phenomenon where an alteration of circulation patterns lead to a reduction in the blood directed to the coronary circulation. It is caused when there is narrowing of the coronary arteries and a coronary vasodilator is used - "stealing" blood away from those parts of the heart. This happens as a result of the narrowed coronary arteries being always maximally dilated to compensate for the decreased upstream blood supply. Thus, dilating the resistance vessels in the coronary circulation causes blood to be shunted away from the coronary vessels supplying the ischemic zones, creating more ischemia.
Causative agents.
It is associated with dipyridamole. Hence, dipyridamole is a pharmacological success, but a therapeutic failure because of the coronary steal phenomenon.
Coronary steal is also the mechanism in most drug-based cardiac stress tests; When a patient is incapable of doing physical activity they are given a vasodilator that produces a "cardiac steal syndrome" as a diagnostic procedure. The test result is positive if the patient's symptoms reappear or if ECG alterations are seen.
It is also associated with the administration of Isoflurane, which is an inhaled anesthetic. Hydralazine can potentially cause this condition as well, as it is a direct arteriolar vasodilator.
It has been associated with nitroprusside.
Other causes.
Coronary arteriovenous fistula between coronary artery and another cardiac chamber, like, the coronary sinus, right atrium, or right ventricle ; may cause steal syndrome under conditions like myocardial infarction and possible angina or ventricular arrhythmias, if the shunt is large in magnitude.
It can also be associated with new patterns of blood vessel growth.
Treatment.
It is sometimes treated by surgery.

Port Victoria Grain Griffin

The Grain Griffin was a British carrier based reconnaissance aircraft developed and built by the RNAS Marine Experimental Depot, Port Victoria during the First World War. A development of the unsuccessful Sopwith B.1 bomber, the Grain Griffin was a two-seat single-engined biplane that was built in small numbers for Britain's Royal Naval Air Service, being used operationally during the British intervention in the Russian Civil War. 
Development and design.
In late 1916, Sopwith designed and built a prototype of a single-engined, single-seat bomber, the Sopwith B.1. It had demonstrated good performance, and had been briefly evaluated by the RNAS in the bomber role over the Western Front in May-June 1917, but was rejected, with larger twin-engined bombers being preferred. 
After its return from France, the prototype B.1 (serial no. "N.50"), was sent to the RNAS Marine Experimental Depot at Port Victoria on the Isle of Grain for conversion to a two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, to be fitted with folding wings for operation from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. A cockpit for the observer replaced the bomb-bay of the B.1 behind the pilot's cockpit, while the wings were shortened to allow them to fold. A hydroplane was fitted ahead of the undercarriage and floatation gear added to allow safe ditching at sea. It retained the Hispano-Suiza 8 engine used by the bomber. When the modified aircraft was tested in November 1917, it was found that the changes had greatly reduced the aircraft's performance, while handling was also poor, with little aileron control.
The design office at Port Victora had realised prior to the first flight that the proposed changes would not be beneficial to performance, and had commenced design of a modified design, based on the B.1, to solve these problems. These changes included new, longer-span, two-bay wings and a wider fuselage to give room to carry a radio for the observer. The new aircraft was given the name Grain Griffin. "N.50" was modified with the new wings and modified controls which greatly improved performance and handling. 
The first of the true Griffins, serial number N.100, powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) Sunbeam Arab engine started testing in June 1918. A further six Griffins followed, with one powered by the unreliable Arab and the remaining five powered by the 230 hp Bentley BR2 rotary engine.
Operational history.
The Griffins did not see service during the First World War. however, in July 1919, at least three Griffins were deployed on board the aircraft carrier HMS "Vindictive" when it sailed to the Baltic Sea in support of the British intervention in the Baltic as part of the Russian Civil War. The Griffin was replaced in service by the Parnall Panther, which was chosen to equip the Royal Air Force's Fleet Spotter squadrons.

2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes

The 2009 Lindsey Oil Refinery strikes were a series of wildcat strikes that affected the energy industry in the United Kingdom in 2009. The action involved workers at around a dozen energy sites across the UK who walked out in support of other British workers at the Total's Lindsey Oil Refinery. The Lindsey Oil Refinery construction workers went on strike because employment was not offered to them on a £200 million construction contract to build a hydro desulphurisation unit at the site.
January 2009 action.
On 28 January 2009, approximately 800 of Lindsey Oil Refinery's local contractors went on strike following the appointment by the Italian construction contractor IREM of several hundred European (mainly Italian and Portuguese) contractors on the site at a time of high unemployment in the local and global economy. The action attracted considerable media interest.
Workers contended that the strike was in defence of a national agreement determining wages and conditions in the industry. 
The protests were largely portrayed in the British media as being solely about the use the European Union's Posted Workers Directive to discriminate against British workers, prompting Unite the union to make a statement on 4 February to refute xenophobic comments in the media. Since European Union law enshrines the right to the freedom of movement for workers between EU member states, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: "When I talked about British jobs, I was talking about giving people in Britain the skills, so that they have the ability to get jobs which were at present going to people from abroad, and actually encouraging people to take up the courses and the education and learning that is necessary for British workers to be far more skilled for the future." Asked for his message to people considering the wildcat strikes, he said: "That that's not the right thing to do and it's not defensible." Italian and Portuguese construction workers, living on barges in nearby docks, were set to starting work there. British trade unions claimed Britons were not given any opportunity to apply for the posts.
Additional contractors at other sites in the United Kingdom also initiated action as a result of the protests. On 30 January, around 700 workers at the Grangemouth Oil Refinery in central Scotland walked out in solidarity with the North Lincolnshire strikers. They were also joined by 50 strikers in Aberthaw, in South Wales, 400 at the ICI site in Wilton, Teesside. and walkouts also took place at British Petroleum in Saltend, Hull.
Following several days of talks between representatives from Total and the GMB union which were chaired by Acas, a deal was finally struck on 5 February and workers at the refinery agreed to return to work the following Monday. The deal would see 102 new jobs being created for British workers in addition to the posts awarded to an IREM. An earlier deal that would have seen the creation of 60 British jobs (40 skilled and 20 unskilled) had been rejected. On 16 February an Acas report concluded that Total had not broken the law in employing Italian workers at the refinery.
The strike at Lindsey resumed on 11 June 2009, after a subcontractor at the site laid off a number of employees, later confirmed to be 51. The strike was quickly followed by sympathy strikes at Cheshire's Fiddlers Ferry Power Station on 15 June and Aberthaw on 17 June. The strikes escalated on 18 June, with walkouts at Drax Power Station and Eggborough Power Station in Yorkshire and Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station in Nottinghamshire, BP Saltend, and the BOC oxygen plant at Scunthorpe.
June 2009 action.
On 19 June 2009 nearly 700 construction staff were sacked at the Lindsey Oil Refinery. The sackings came following 1,200 workers walking out unofficially at the plant in a jobs dispute. The following plants walked out in sympathy:
Paul Kenny, General Secretary of the GMB trade union, said: "GMB condemn the action of Total. Total have for a full week refused to meet the union to resolve the problems through ACAS. It seems pretty obvious that there is a mass case of victimisation taking place here. Locking out the workforce at Lindsay will not solve the problem. It will escalate it."
Workers at the Lindsey refinery were invited to re-apply for their jobs, with managers at Total giving them a deadline of 17:00 on Monday 22 June 2009 to do so. However, angered by the actions of the management, workers burned their dismissal letters at a protest outside the refinery. Around 3,000 workers at other sites around the country also walked out in support of the Lindsey workers.
Negotiations between Total and representatives of the GMB union were adjourned on Tuesday 23 June with some progress having been made, but sources said a number of "significant barriers" remained outstanding before the dispute could be resolved. Talks resumed on 25 June, and an agreement was reached late that evening to end the industrial action, accepted at a mass meeting outside the refinery on the following Monday. The deal included the reinstatement of the 647 workers at the Lindsey site who had been sacked for taking unofficial action, offers of alternative jobs for the 51 workers laid off, and assurances that workers at power stations and oil and gas terminals who walked out in sympathy would not be victimised. On 29 June workers at the refinery voted to accept the deal.

Polyhalogenated compound

Polyhalogenated compounds (PHCs) are any compounds with multiple substitutions of halogens. They are of particular interest and importance because halogens generally are highly reactive and also bioaccumulate in humans, and comprise a superset of which has many toxic and carcinogenic industrial chemicals as members. PBDEs, PCBs, dioxins (PCDDs) and PFCs are all polyhalogenated compounds. They are generally non-miscible in organic solvents or water, but miscible in some hydrocarbons from which they often derive. 
Uses.
PHCs are used in a vast array of manufactured products, from wood treatments, to cookware coatings, to non-stick, waterproof, and fire-resistant coatings, cosmetics, medicine, electronic fluids, food containers and wrappings, in everything from furniture and furnishings, automobiles, airplanes, plastics, clothing and cloth, surgery, insulation, adhesives, paints, sealants, lubricating oils, polyurethane foams, cancer therapy and medical imaging. They are also heavily used in pest control.
Safety.
PHCs include notoriously dangerous substances, including Agent Orange, DDT, and other pesticides. Many non-pesticide PHCs have the same safety issues as pesticides.
Breakdown of compounds.
Despite bioaccumulating in humans, patents have been filed for removal of halogen by electrolysis during manufacturing, though toxic chlorinated compounds may be created as byproducts of chlorinated compounds. Another method during manufacture is to use anaerobic bacteria

Ernest Allmendinger

Ernest "Aqua" Allmendinger (August 25, 1890 – May 7, 1973) was an All-American college football player.
Early years.
A native of Ann Arbor, Michigan, Allmendinger played right guard and right tackle at Ann Arbor High School, for teams that lost one game in three seasons. He acquired the nickname "Aqua" after working as a waterboy for railroad building crews.
University of Michigan.
Allmendinger played the guard position at the University of Michigan from 1911–1913. In November 1913, Allmendinger helped Michigan to a 17–0 win over Cornell leading "The Washington Post" to report: "Allmendinger played a brilliant game on the defense. Three hundred Michigan rooters, headed by their brass band, paraded and snake-danced after the game." At the end of the 1913 season, Allmendinger was picked as an All-Western guard on nearly all of the honorary All-Western teams. A newspaper account in the summer of 1917 described Allmendinger's progression as follows:"Allmendinger, a young giant in perfect physical condition tried unsuccessfully for two years to make the varsity eleven. His quiet temperament was the handicap and during these years Coach Yost declared that if Allmendinger 'could get good and mad once, he would be one of the greatest linemen in the game.' The third season Yost became desperate. He used third degree methods, and finally the giant awoke, Allmendinger became a demon on the gridiron, nearly every western critic put him on their all-star elevens and some experts thought he should have made the All-American."
Service in World War I and Walter Camp's All-Service Team.
In July 1917, as the United States entered World War I, Allmendinger enrolled in the U.S. Army, I Company, 31st Michigan Infantry, becoming "another University of Michigan athlete to answer his country's call." Allmendinger was one of several prominent football players commissioned at Fort Sheridan in the fall of 1917; others included former Michigan All-Americans Albert Benbrook and James B. Craig. On Thanksgiving Day 1917, with the country's top players in the military, an All-Star game between the country's top Army and Navy players was held at Stagg Field in Chicago. Almmendinger was the starting right tackle on the Army team. Because of the war, Walter Camp did not select an All-America team in 1917. Instead, Camp named an All-America service team in 1917, recognizing the country's top football players serving in the military. Allmendinger was named to Camp's 1917 All-Service team. Allmendinger rose to the rank of captain before being discharged in 1919. He also worked as an assistant football coach at Michigan during the 1919 season.
Career outside football.
Allmendinger received a forestry degree from the University of Michigan and worked in the western forests after graduating. He later worked for 34 years as an engineer for the Washtenaw County Road Commission from 1921–1954, and after that for the Huron-Clinton Metropolitan Authority.

Scientology in Germany

The Church of Scientology has been present in Germany since 1970. German authorities estimate that there are 4,000 active Scientologists in Germany today; the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around 12,000. The Church of Scientology has encountered particular antagonism from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal, social and cultural position in Germany.
German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or worldview community, and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions. The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization's activities. The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion. It views it as an abusive business masquerading as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution. This stance has been criticized, most notably by the U.S. government, which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has repeatedly raised concerns over discriminatory practices directed at individual Scientologists.
Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions. They are barred from membership in some major political parties, and businesses and other employers use so-called "sect filters" to expose a prospective business partner's or employee's association with the organization. German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007, but abandoned the initiative a year later, finding insufficient legal grounds. Despite this, polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether.
Background.
Scientology, founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries, has been a very controversial new religious movement. Its stated utopian aim is to "clear the planet", to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations. Scientology teaches that the source of people's unhappiness lies in "engrams", psychological burdens acquired in the course of painful experiences, which can be cleared through a type of counselling called "auditing" made available by the Church of Scientology.
The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for auditing and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history, with governments classing it as a profit-making enterprise rather than as a religion. Critics maintain that Scientology is "a business-driven, psychologically manipulative, totalitarian ideology with world-dominating aspirations", and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses. Scientology has fought innumerable lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion. These efforts have been partly successful – Scientology has gained recognition as a tax-exempt religious group in a number of countries, most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993, and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights, which censured Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion.
The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion, but a "commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism" whose "totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany's democratic society". Accordingly, the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization. Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology; in France, the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009, after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products, and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether. Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium, Greece and the UK.
On the subject of Scientology's status as a religion, the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany. That court, noting Hubbard's instruction that Scientologists should "make money, make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money", came to the conclusion that "Scientology purports to be a 'church' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests". In the same decision, the court also found that Scientology uses "inhuman and totalitarian practices". Given the lessons of Germany's 20th-century history, in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings, Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power. References in Scientology writings to the elimination of "parasites" and "antisocial" people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology's utopian world "without insanity, without criminals and without war" evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism, and have led to Scientology being classified as an "extremist political movement".
To further justify its stance, the German government has also pointed to the long history of U.S. court cases involving Scientology, including the conviction of 11 top Scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of U.S. government agencies, wiretapping and the theft of government documents, a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a "coercive environment", and Scientology's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators. In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are "structured so as to make the individual psychologically and financially dependent on a Scientology system", and that members often abandon contact with friends and family.
History.
Scientology presence in Germany.
Scientology first became active in Germany in 1970. By 2007, there were ten major centres ("Scientology Churches"), as well as fourteen minor centres ("Scientology Missions") in Germany. The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities – Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main, Hanover and Stuttgart. Of the Scientology Missions, nine are in Baden-Württemberg, and three in Bavaria. Following German re-unification, Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic; most adherents are found in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and North-Rhine Westphalia.
Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or "Vereine" in Germany; their umbrella organisation is the "Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V." Germany's domestic intelligence service, the "Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz" ("BfV", or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution), estimates that there are 4,000 Scientologists in Germany, down from earlier estimates of 5,000 to 6,000. The Church of Scientology reported around 30,000 members from the mid-1990s onwards; this number remained stable for many years. However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12,000 members. Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures, essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses, regardless of their subsequent involvement. The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred.
Scientology formulated a "Clear Germany" strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world – with the long-term aim of transforming German society in line with the Scientological ideal: a non-pluralist society in which Scientology enjoys overriding influence. The programme sought to address Scientology's image problems in Germany, to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain, such as Germany's National Socialist history, and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society, with a special emphasis on manoeuvring Scientologists into key positions in industry and government. As most religions seek to widen their influence in society, such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort, much like those many religions engage in. However, according to the "BfV", the strategy has not had any significant success. By 1998, 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed, but apart from some isolated cases, most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology. According to Fifka & Sydora (2009), it is unknown to what degree the "Clear Germany" programme is still being pursued.
Public opposition.
In German public discourse, Scientology is not considered a religion, but is generally characterized as a "Sekte" (cult or sect), or as an exploitative profit-making venture preying on vulnerable minds. Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults date back to the early 1970s, when there was widespread debate about "youth religions" such as the Unification Church, ISKCON, Children of God, and the Divine Light Mission. The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the "sect commissioners" ("Sektenbeauftragte") of Germany's Protestant Churches, who were also active in promoting the establishment of private "initiatives of parents and concerned persons". "Aktion Bildungsinformation" ("Educational Information Campaign"), an organization dedicated to opposing Scientology, was established in the 1970s. Taking an activist stance, it warned people not to get involved with Scientology, filed successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its proselytizing in public places, and published an influential book, "The Sect of Scientology and its Front Organizations". In 1981, the organization's founder, Ingo Heinemann, became the director of "Aktion für geistige und psychische Freiheit" ("Campaign for Intellectual and Psychic Freedom"), Germany's most prominent anti-cult organization. Warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with the situation; as the movements were not doing anything illegal, the government resorted to issuing a range of leaflets and public statements giving general warnings about religious sects, the earliest of these publications appearing in 1979.
Fueled by events such as the Waco Siege in 1993, the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple, and the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo incidents in Japan, German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s, with Scientology attracting particular attention. Perceptions that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert Vaughn Young, an American ex-Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology, visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in "Der Spiegel", a widely-read weekly magazine, describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a gulag – the Rehabilitation Project Force – for members of Scientology's Sea Org who had been found guilty of transgressions. From the mid-1990s onward, press articles, reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis, accompanied by books and TV programmes that reached a mass audience.
As noted by the religious scholar Hubert Seiwert, Scientology came to be seen as a "serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will-less zombies, but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state". This view of Scientology as a public enemy, Seiwert adds, "became a matter of political correctness": senior political figures were involved in launching campaigns against Scientology, and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social ostracism. Stephen A. Kent, writing in 1998, noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed. Scientology was viewed as "a totalitarian, business-driven organization [...] guilty of significant human rights abuses." Officials examining primary and secondary sources, legal documents, and the testimony of former members, concluded that the organization was "antithetical to a democratic state". Federal ministries and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology.
Government publications on the dangers of sects increased between 1996 and 1998, and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology. The German courts had approved such publications in 1989, seeing them as part of the government's responsibility to keep the public informed, and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom. In 1996, the German parliament launched an Enquete (Enquiry) Commission to investigate sects and similar groups, in large part because of public concerns about Scientology. Its final report, published in June 1998, concluded that Scientology, alone among new religious movements, required monitoring by Germany's domestic intelligence services.
An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged "infiltration" of businesses by Scientologists, in line with Scientology's declared aim to penetrate society, politics and business in preparation for world domination. Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium-size companies, such as estate agents, management consultants and management training companies. Management consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their association with Scientology; once they have recruited members of their clients' upper management, these managers may send employees to Scientology trainers, as part of company education and training programmes, without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used. An expensive commercial version of Scientology's Oxford Capacity Analysis, usually offered free as part of Scientology proselytizing in public places, temporarily entered some major German companies who were unaware of its provenance via such a management consultancy firm.
In the mid-2000s, German sect experts were concerned that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after-school tutoring market. These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after-school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists, using Scientology methods. Brochures advertising the tutoring services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself.
In early 2008, Thomas Gandow, Sect Commissioner of the German Lutheran Church in Berlin and Brandenburg, and the historian Guido Knopp both likened the Scientologist Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. Gandow and Knopp cited a leaked Scientology video in which Cruise was seen asking the audience whether Scientologists should "clean up" the world, the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which Gandow and Knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience's response to Goebbels' famous question, "Do you want total war?" Gandow's and Knopp's comments found few critics in Germany. Most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization. In 1997, "Time" reported that 70% of Germans favoured banning Scientology; a poll conducted in September 2008 by "Der Spiegel" found 67% support for a ban.
German scholars such as Brigitte Schön and Gerald Willms have commented that public discourse around Scientology in Germany is dominated by rhetoric: in their view, efforts to "frame" information in such a way as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities. In Schön's words, this includes both the "efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements" and "Scientology's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution"; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany, she adds that "the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes." Both Willms and Schön assert that the situation is compounded by the general paucity of scientific studies of Scientology. Schön as well as Irving Hexham, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada, have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars. Hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany, which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject, because they fear repercussions for their research funding and their prospects of future employment if they were to involve themselves in the debate.
The film "Until Nothing Remains", a dramatized account of the effect Scientology had on one German family, was shown in 2010 by German public broadcaster ARD. Said to be based on a true story, the film attracted widespread media attention, and a viewership of 8.69 million.
Legal status.
While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned, the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there. Its precise legal status however is unresolved. Two points are contested: first, whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a "religion or worldview" ("Religion" or "Weltanschauung"; these are equal before German law), and secondly, whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity; if the latter were the case, this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a "religious or worldview community" ("Religions- oder Weltanschauungsgemeinschaft") under Article 4 of the German constitution, which guarantees the freedom of belief, religion and worldview. Status as a "religious or worldview community" also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany, such as taxation and freedom of association.
The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter, but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or worldview community. The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a worldview community. In 1995, the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or worldview community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution, although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003. In another 2003 decision, the Administrative Court of Baden-Württemberg in Mannheim said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity. In 2005, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4.1 of the German Constitution, which declares the freedom of religion and worldview inviolate.
Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.
Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology's favour, despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public.
Government surveillance.
Given the history of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The "BfV" domestic intelligence service ("Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz", or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German "Länder". Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal.
The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court. In December 2001, the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid informants. The court ruled that the use of informants was disproportionate. In 2003, the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report, given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution.
At the federal level, Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the "BfV" in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.
In Saarland, surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005, because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members. As of 6 May 2008, the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the "BfV" after the North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court in Münster refused to hear an appeal on the matter. Being suspected of maintaining "ambitions against the free, democratic basic order", the Scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its bylaws.
There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany. In 1998, the Swiss government detained an agent of the German government, charging him with "carrying out illegal business for a foreign state, working for a political information service and falsifying identity documents". The German government posted bail for the agent. He was eventually given a 30-day suspended jail sentence for spying on Scientology, and the German government apologized to Switzerland for the incident.
"Sect filters".
A "sect filter", also known as a "protective declaration" ("Schutzerklärung"), is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract. Such sect filters, primarily used to screen out Scientologists, have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses. "Sect commissioner's" offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government.
A work instruction introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the "Arbeitsämter" – local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs – to mark companies owned by Scientologists with the letter "S". Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff, prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff. Government officials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses; some businesspeople have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma.
Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists, applicants for civil service positions in Bavaria are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists, and a similar policy has been instituted in Hesse. Companies tendering for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists; in 2001, this requirement was changed, and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that "the technology of L. Ron Hubbard will not be used in executing the contract". When it became known that Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system included a disk defragmenter developed by Executive Software International (a company headed by a Scientologist), this caused concern among German government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage. To assuage these concerns, Microsoft Germany agreed to provide a means to disable the utility. Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers, some American companies such as General Electric, IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German subsidiaries to cease the use of protective declarations.
The city-state of Hamburg set up a full-time office dedicated to opposing Scientology, the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority, under the leadership of Ursula Caberta. In 2005, in a case brought by a Scientologist, the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community, finding that the practice infringed religious freedom. In June 2008, the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5,000 Euros ($7,000) for not complying with court instructions banning the use of "sect filters." Internet links to sample filters to be used by businesses had continued to remain available. Eileen Barker, a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, has noted that "Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in restricting the civil rights of Scientologists." The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts; Caberta moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority, where she continues her work on Scientology.
Scientologists have been banned from joining major political parties in Germany such as the Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the Free Democratic Party. Existing Scientologist members of these parties have been "purged", according to "Time Magazine". Scientologists have been prevented from running employment and au pair agencies in Germany; Scientologists who were running such agencies had their permits revoked. In 1995, a sports scientist and former member of the German national fencing team was dismissed from his job at the German Olympic fencing centre after he stated in an interview that he had enjoyed reading books by L. Ron Hubbard and had participated in a course run by a Scientologist management and communication consultancy firm. Thomas Gottschalk, a German TV presenter, was falsely accused in 1993 of having taken part in Scientology courses; Gottschalk responded by announcing that he had not, and that he would henceforth cease all contact with a friend who had links to Scientology. In 2007, Günther Oettinger, the Minister-President of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, expressed concern that Scientologist John Travolta was to appear on Gottschalk's programme, and asked the ZDF TV station to consider revoking the invitation; the ZDF said that uninviting Travolta would cause greater damage, and that Scientology was not going to be discussed in the programme.
In 2010, the Bavarian Administrative Court ruled that a woman working in a children's daycare centre, whose employment had been terminated when her ex-husband identified her as a Scientologist, should be reinstated. The woman had demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that her Scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work. According to the agreement that concluded the case, she promised not to use Scientology methods in her work, and to inform the children's parents of her membership in Scientology.
Initiative to ban Scientology.
In March 2007, it was reported that German authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor Scientology in response to the opening of a new Scientology headquarters in Berlin. On December 7, 2007, German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti-constitutional goals, restricting "essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment", and asked Germany's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization.
The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the political spectrum, with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts. Sabine Weber, president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin, called the accusations "unrealistic" and "absurd" and said that the German interior ministers' evaluation was based on "a few sentences out of 500,000 pages of Scientological literature". She added, "I can also find hundreds of quotes in the Bible that are totalitarian but that doesn't mean I will demand the ban of Christianity."
In November 2008, the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology, after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity. The report by the "BfV" cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful. First, the "BfV" report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization; there were German churches and missions, a German board, German bylaws, and no evidence that the organization was "totally remote-controlled" from the United States. A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one. The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology's aggressive opposition to the constitution. Here, the report found that Scientology's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany's free and democratic basic order. "Neither its bylaws nor any other utterances" supported the "conclusion that the organization had criminal aims". The "BfV" also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were practising medicine without a licence, but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning.
Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt, Ehrhart Körting, Berlin's interior minister, said, "This organization pursues goals – through its writings, its concept and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution. But they put very little of this into practice. The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that is a lousy organization, but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to." The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision, describing it as the "only one possible". Monitoring of Scientology's activities by the German intelligence services continues.
In February 2009, the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters, warning passers-by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom, should be removed. The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists' basic religious rights.
Criticism of Germany's stance.
The United States media, while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news, has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany. Richard Cohen for example, writing in the "Washington Post", said in 1996: "Scientology might be one weird religion, but the German reaction to it is weirder still – not to mention disturbing." Alan Cowell, writing in the "New York Times", wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology – motivated by officials' fear that Scientology "was a totalitarian movement growing, like the Nazi party, from inconsequential beginnings" – was itself redolent of "the Nazi era's authoritarianism".
The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists' individual rights posed by sect filters. The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, through which Scientology gained the status of a tax-exempt religion in the United States. That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington, using paid lobbyists. The State Department's 1996 human rights report on Germany, released in January 1997, warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections "may face boycotts and discrimination, sometimes with government approval." Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta, as well as jazz pianist Chick Corea.
Also in January 1997, an open letter to then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared, published as a newspaper advertisement in the "International Herald Tribune", drawing parallels between the "organized oppression" of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s. The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer Bertram Fields, whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John Travolta, and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry, including the top executives of MGM, Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie Hawn, director Oliver Stone, writers Mario Puzo and Gore Vidal and talk-show host Larry King. It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself, which until then had received scant notice, and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington.
U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as "outrageous" and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology, saying, "We have criticized the Germans on this, but we aren't going to support the Scientologists' terror tactics against the German government." Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the letter, said that those who signed it "don't know a thing about Germany and don't want to know." German officials argued that "the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as "absurd" and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a "contemptuous cartel of oppression".
In February 1997, a United States immigration court judge granted asylum to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland. In April 1997, John Travolta met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia. Travolta later said Clinton assured him that he would "really love to help" with the "issue over in Germany with Scientology". According to Travolta, Clinton recalled that "he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him, and respected his views on it", stating that Scientologists "were given an unfair hand in and that he wanted to fix it". In September 1997, John Travolta, Chick Corea and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, also known as the Helsinki Commission), voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany, and had a briefing with United States National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, whom Clinton had assigned to be "the administration's Scientology point person". The German ambassador responded with a letter to the CSCE stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology's "pseudo-scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members", adding that "membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency, to financial ruin, and even to suicide. In addition, there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany's basic political principles."
A United Nations report in April 1998 asserted that individuals in Germany were discriminated against because of their affiliation with Scientology. However, it rejected the comparison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during the Nazi era.
In 2000, the German "Stern" magazine published the results of its investigation of the asylum case. It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum. On a 2000 visit to Clearwater, Florida, Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an "orchestrated effort" by Scientology undertaken "for political gain", and "a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system". German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a "hate campaign" in Germany that had "ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists" and maintained that Scientologists had not "exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States." Mark Rathbun, a top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, "there would have been nothing improper if it had."
In 2003, Joachim Güntner, writing in the Swiss "Neue Zürcher Zeitung", noted that Gerhard Besier, a German Christian theologian, director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University, Sweden, for his championing of religious freedom, had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology. Güntner concluded that "alarmism" had "triumphed" over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter.
The U.S. Department of State's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany, published in 2013, stated that "The status of the Church of Scientology remains in limbo. The Constitutional Court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that Scientology is a religion. Government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against Scientology as a group and against its members. Four of the major political parties (the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Social Democratic Party, and Free Democratic Party) ban Scientologists from party membership. [...] Scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination. Although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so-called 'sect filters' to blacklist and boycott Scientologists, they remained in use in the public sector. 'Sect filters' typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with Scientology, did not participate in its training courses, and rejected its doctrines. [...] Catholic and Protestant churches continued to oppose Scientology publically "", although press reporting and public reactions to Scientology decreased. Several private organizations issued warnings about after-school study programs run by Scientologists."

Jason Garrison

Jason John Maxwell Garrison (born November 13, 1984) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). Garrison played two years of Junior A with the Nanaimo Clippers of the British Columbia Hockey League, during which time, he earned a scholarship to play college hockey with the University of Minnesota-Duluth. Following his third NCAA year, he signed with the Florida Panthers as an undrafted free agent in 2008. Garrison spent four years with the Panthers organization, setting franchise records for single-season goals and power play goals by a defenceman in 2011–12. In July 2012, he signed a six-year deal with his hometown team, the Canucks.
Personal life.
Garrison was born and raised in White Rock, British Columbia, where he attended Chantrell Creek Elementary and Elgin Park Secondary School. He played minor hockey in nearby Semiahmoo Bay, as well as Burnaby and Aldergrove. Growing up, he also played rugby, volleyball and was an avid snowboarder. Moving away from home to play junior hockey in 2003, he lived in Nanaimo, British Columbia, for two years, before attending the University of Minnesota-Duluth on an athletic scholarship. During his NHL career with the Florida Panthers, he lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, while returning to a home in Downtown Vancouver in the off-seasons. Currently, Jason is dating actress Katie Cassidy from The CW's superhero TV series Arrow.
Playing career.
Junior and college.
Garrison did not make the transition from minor to junior hockey until the age of 19. Joining the Nanaimo Clippers of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), he played at the Junior A level for two years. Appearing in 52 regular season games in 2003–04, he recorded 7 goals and 27 assists as a rookie. A forward in his minor hockey years, Garrison switched to defence in his first junior year. Garrison went on to add 3 goals and 13 points over 24 post-season games as the Clippers won the Fred Page Cup as league champions and the Doyle Cup as Western Canada regional champions. Competing for the national title at the 2004 Royal Bank Cup, the Clippers finished last out of five teams. Garrison had three assists in four tournament contests. The following season, he improved to 22 goals and 62 points over 57 games, ranking second in team scoring. The Clippers finished first in BCHL regular season play, but were eliminated in the Fred Page Cup semifinals.
Earning an athletic scholarship, Garrison went on to play NCAA hockey with the University of Minnesota Duluth of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). In his freshman year, he recorded 3 goals and 12 assists over 40 games in 2005-06. In the following two seasons, Garrison struggled with injuries and recorded 3 points over 21 games and 14 points over 26 games in 2006-07 and 2007–08, respectively.
Professional.
Garrison decided to forego his senior year of college after being offered a National Hockey League (NHL) contract with the Florida Panthers. He signed a two-year, entry level deal with the team on April 2, 2008. Turning professional in 2008–09, he was assigned to the Panthers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans. Within a month, he was recalled by the Panthers and appeared in his first NHL game against the St. Louis Blues on October 25, 2008. It was the only NHL game he appeared in that season as he was quickly returned to the minors. In the AHL, he scored 8 goals and 35 points in 75 games, ranking fourth among rookie defencemen in scoring.
Garrison split the season in 2009–10 between the Panthers and the Americans, scoring his first NHL goal in a 7-4 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on March 3, 2010. Playing in 39 NHL games, he scored 2 goals and 8 points, while also recording 3 goals and 19 points in 38 AHL contests. Forming a shutdown pairing with Mike Weaver, Garrison played his first full season with the Panthers in 2010–11. Appearing in 73 games, he totalled 5 goals and 18 points. With a -2 plus-minus while playing on the worst team in the Eastern Conference, Garrison was ranked by James Mirtle of the "Globe and Mail" as the league's second-best defensive defenceman.
Playing in his fourth season with the Panthers organization, Garrison was instrumental in the team's newfound success in 2011-12, while playing in a more offensive role on a pairing with Brian Campbell. On March 23, 2012, Garrison set a Panthers franchise record for most goals by a defenceman in a single season with his 16th goal in a game against the Edmonton Oilers. He surpassed the previous mark of 15 set by Jay Bouwmeester (2007–08, 2008–09) and Bryan McCabe (2008–09). His 9 powerplay goals also tied the team record held by Bouwmeester (2008–09) and Gordon Murphy (1993-94). Adding 17 assists, Garrison finished with 33 points in 77 games, helping the Panthers reach the playoffs for the first time since 2000. Playing the New Jersey Devils in the first round, they were eliminated in seven games. Garrison recorded a goal and two assists in four post-season games before sustaining a pair of lower-body injuries that sidelined him for the remainder of the series.
Becoming an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, Garrison signed a 6-year contract worth $27.6 million with the Vancouver Canucks on July 1, 2012. His $4.6 million cap hit constituted a nearly sevenfold increase of his previous season's $675,000 salary. In the months ahead of his free agency, Garrison went on record as being interested in playing for the Canucks, his hometown team. Due to the NHL lockout, Garrison's debut with his new team was delayed until February 2013. Upon the commencement of NHL play, his struggles to adjust with his new team were well-publicized, as he was taken off the powerplay unit and separated from his intended defensive partner, Alex Edler within the first month.
On June 27, 2014, Garrison was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning along with the rights to Jeff Costello and a 7th round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for a 2nd round pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.

Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame

The Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame is located in the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame & Northwest Louisiana History Museum – Natchitoches in a new facility in the downtown historic district in Natchitoches, Louisiana. After years of planning and construction, the LHOF opened on June 28, 2013. Lieutenant Governor Jay Dardenne, whose office handles state tourism matters, was on hand for the grand opening. 
The museum had been fifty-five years in search of a permanent home. Many of the artifacts had previously been stored at Prather Coliseum on the campus of Northwestern State University in Natchitoches. Because of Hurricane Katrina there had been fear that the proposed museum would be deleted from approved projects in 2005 by the Louisiana Bond Commission. Then State Representative Taylor Townsend, however, informed Hall of Fame executive director Doug Ireland that the sports museum, unlike other similar proposals, had survived the vetting process. Natchitoches Mayor Lee Posey said the museum is a "tremendous" boost to Natchitoches-area tourism.
Inductees.
The first inductees were named to the Hall of Fame in 1958.

USS Chichota (SP-65)

USS "Chichota" (SP-65) was an armed yacht that served in the United States Navy as a patrol vessel from 1917 to 1918.
"Chichota" was built as the private steam yacht "Niagara III" in 1901 by Herreshoff Manufacturing Company at Bristol, Rhode Island. She had been renamed "Chichota" by the time the U.S. Navy acquired her for World War I service as a patrol vessel under a free lease from her owner, Edwin Gould of New York City, on 1 May 1917. The Navy commissioned her on 5 June 1917 as USS "Chichota" (SP-65).
"Chichota" was assigned to the 3rd Naval District, where she performed submarine net patrol duty in the New York Harbor area. She was transferred for a brief time to the Chesapeake Bay area, but returned to New York early in 1918.
"Chichota" was decommissioned on 21 December 1918 and returned to her owner.

<doc id="21354028" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21354028" title="Normalized frequency (digital signal processing)">
Normalized frequency (digital signal processing)

In digital signal processing (DSP), the continuous time variable, t, with units of "seconds", is replaced by the discrete integer variable, n, with units of "samples". More precisely, the time variable, in "seconds", has been normalized (divided) by the sampling interval, T ("seconds/sample"), which causes time to have convenient integer values at the moments of sampling. This practice is analogous to the concept of Natural units, meaning that the natural unit of time in a DSP system is "samples". Accordingly, the natural unit of frequency is "cycles/sample", known as normalized frequency.
The normalized value of a frequency variable, formula_1 ("cycles/sec"), is formula_2  where formula_3  is the sampling rate in "samples/sec".  The maximum frequency that can be unambiguously represented by "digital" data is formula_4  (known as Nyquist frequency) when the samples are real numbers, and formula_5  when the samples are complex numbers.  The normalized values of these limits are respectively 0.5 and 1.0 "cycles/sample". This has the advantage of simplicity, but (similar to natural units) there is a potential disadvantage in terms of loss of clarity and understanding, as these constants formula_6 and formula_5 are then omitted from mathematical expressions of physical laws.
The simplicity offered by normalized units is favored in textbooks, where space is limited and where real units are incidental to the point of a theorem or its proof. But there is another advantage in the DSP realm (compared to physics), because formula_6 and formula_5 are not "universal physical constants". The use of normalized frequency allows us to present concepts that are universal to all sample rates in a way that is independent of sample rate. An example of such a concept is a digital filter design whose bandwidth is specified not in hertz, but as a percentage of the sample rate of the data passing through it. Formulas expressed in terms of formula_5  and/or formula_6  are readily converted to normalized frequency by setting those parameters to 1. The inverse operation is usually accomplished by replacing instances of the frequency parameter, formula_12  with formula_13  or  formula_14
Alternative normalizations.
Some programs (such as MATLAB) that design filters with real-valued coefficients use the Nyquist frequency (formula_4) as the normalization constant. The resultant normalized frequency has units of "half-cycles/sample" or equivalently "cycles per 2 samples".
Sometimes, the unnormalized frequency is represented in units of "radians/second" (angular frequency), and denoted by formula_16  When formula_17 is normalized by the sample-rate ("samples/sec"), the resulting units are "radians/sample". The normalized Nyquist frequency is π "radians/sample", and the normalized sample-rate is 2π "radians/sample".
The following table shows examples of normalized frequencies for a 1 kHz signal, a sample rate formula_18 = 44.1 kHz, and 3 different choices of normalized units. Also shown is the frequency region containing one cycle of the discrete-time Fourier transform, which is always a periodic function.

Ann Pamela Cunningham (August 15, 1816 Rosemont Plantation, South Carolina - May 1, 1875) is credited with saving George Washington's beloved home Mount Vernon from ruin and neglect. In a letter to Ann Pamela, Cunningham's mother described the crumbling condition of the estate as she saw it in 1853 while on a steamship heading down the Potomac River. Cunningham was in her 30s and, having been crippled in a riding accident as a teenager, decided she would initiate a campaign to save the estate. She raised funds to purchase Mount Vernon by launching an unprecedented appeal for donations through newspaper articles directed toward "the Ladies of the South" and founded The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association of the Union, the group that still owns and manages Washington's estate, and served as its first regent. The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association is the oldest private preservation organization in the United States.

Mojo (play)

Mojo is a 1995 play (then subsequent 1997 feature film) written by English playwright Jez Butterworth that premiered at the Royal Court Theatre in London, directed by Ian Rickson.
It is a black comedy set in Soho, a fast-paced gangster plot that tells the story of this particular night club's culture.
Would-be rock 'n' roll star 'Silver Johnny' is on the road to fame and fortune during the summer of 1958, but encounters problems with his jealous manager, Ezra, the owner of the Atlantic Club, who is hell-bent on protecting him from the amorous advances of creepy local gangster/entrepreneur Sam Ross. Skinny, a member of Johnny's group, and one of the club's pill-popping employees, discovers Ezra sawn in half in separate dustbins, and Ezra's ambitious associate Mickey announces that Ross intends to take over the Atlantic Club.
In 2013 the play was revived at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London's West End, again directed by Ian Rickson. The cast included Rupert Grint, making his stage debut as Sweets, Ben Whishaw as Baby, Daniel Mays as Potts, Brendan Coyle as Mickey, Colin Morgan as Skinny, and Tom Rhys Harries as Silver Johnny. 
Plot.
Set entirely within the seedy Atlantic club, Silver Johnny - a young and talented performer on the road to fame and fortune - is held back by his jealous and protective manager Ezra, owner of the nightclub and father to a psychotic unloved son, Baby. As Silver Johnny progresses up the ladder to stardom, local gangster/entrepreneur Sam Ross begins to take an interest, and the only way to remove opposition (Ezra) appears to be sawing him in half, kidnapping Silver Johnny and leaving the club's fate in a state of limbo.
Ezra is discovered the next morning by his second-in-command, the highly ambitious Mickey, who announces that Ross intends to take over the Atlantic Club, setting the stage for a major power struggle; "He's been fucking cut in half. He's in two bins..."
Terrified by the potential threat of extermination by Ross and his gang, associates of the now deceased Ezra, (Potts, Sweets, Skinny and Baby) begin to lose their nerve, and try to convince themselves it's Mickey's idea of a joke; "It's Mickey's joke, it's Mickey's morning joke!" When this turns out to be false, the Atlantic Club gang prepare for what could be their final night. With just an ancient cutlass and an old Derringer as defence, the group starts to argue amongst themselves and even considers joining Ross, or simply leaving.
As the day wears on, people begin to gather outside the club waiting for the doors to open, oblivious to the situation. Sweating it out inside, the small group of four have to break the tragic news of Ezra's grisly death to Baby, who takes the news in a dreamlike, distant manner. Uneasy about Baby's mental stability, the Atlantic gang begins to become restless - especially about their catering. Arguments break out over frivolous matters (Uncle Tommy), and the group finally settles to consider just what its rivals are doing at that very moment.
In the climax to the fast-paced story, Sweets checks downstairs to see if the coast is clear for the gang to have a little space, rather than being cooped up in a single room, and finds Silver Johnny hanging from the ceiling. In sheer panic, Sweets calls for help, and is joined by the others. Baby reveals that by saving Silver Johnny he killed Mr Ross and discovered that Micky had betrayed them all for a share in the business. Skinny arrives and insults Baby, who responds by shooting him in the head with the Derringer. Mickey, Potts and Sweets attempt to cover the wound and to calm Skinny down, while Baby wanders around aimlessly. Silver Johnny is lowered to the floor and Skinny dies. Unable to save Skinny's life, Mickey's authority and status break down, and he kneels beside his friend's body.
Film version.
In 1997 a film adaptation was released of the stage play. It was also written and directed by Butterworth.

He also spent the 2000 season as hitting coach for Double-A Arkansas. After joining the Royals organization, he managed Idaho Falls Chukars from 2004-07 before mentoring the Burlington Bees in 2008 during which Rupp led the Royals’ Low A affiliate to a 73-65 regular-season record and their first Midwest League Championship since 1999. Under his tutelage, the Bees went from being the worst team in their division over the first half (30-39) to a league-best record and division title in the second half (43-26), winning the half crown by 3.5 games. The team played its best baseball in the final month of the season. Including a 6-0 playoff record, the Bees went 27-9 from August 1 on. The Midwest League named the Bees champions in a rain-shortened finale. In 2009 Rupp managed the Wilmington Blue Rocks to an 84-55 record and Northern Division Championship before losing to the eventual Carolina League Champion Lynchburg Hillcats in game 5 of the semi-finals playoff series. His team set franchise records for consecutive road wins by winning 12 straight games during the 2009 season.

Livedoid dermatitis

Livedoid dermatitis (also known as "Embolia cutis medicamentosa," and "Nicolau syndrome") is a rare iatrogenic cutaneous reaction that occurs immediately after a drug injection. It presents as an immediate, extreme pain around the injection site, with overlying skin rapidly becoming erythematous, violaceous, or blanched ("ischemic pallor") and sometimes with reticular pattern. The reaction eventually leads to variable degrees of necrosis to the skin and underlying tissue. The wound eventually heals, can lead to atrophic, disfiguring scarring.
The reaction is associated with a range of both injection sites and drugs. It was first reported by Freudenthal in 1924 following an injection of bismuth salts for syphilis. Although initial reports were following intramuscular injections, the reaction has since also been reported following subcutaneous, intravenous, and intraarticular injections. Livedoid dermatitis has been reported to occur with many different drug injections, including: penicillins, local anesthetics (e.g. lidocaine), vaccines (e.g. Dtap), corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and more.
Pathogenesis.
The cause of this condition is poorly understood. Microscopic examination of affected tissue shows ischemic necrosis, and so various hypothesis exist to explain this ischemia, including vasospasm from needle prick, the injected drug, or cold compresses applied to the wound.
Diagnosis and Treatment.
The diagnosis is mainly clinical. Skin biopsies of the site show necrosis caused by ischemia. Radiographic imaging may help to delineate the extent of the wound.
Depending on the extent and state of infection of the wound, the condition may require antibiotics, wound debridement in early stages, and corrective plastic surgery in late stages.

<doc id="21354194" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21354194" title="Cabinet of Tonga">
Cabinet of Tonga

The Cabinet of Tonga is the cabinet (executive branch) of the government of the Kingdom of Tonga. It is composed primarily of the ministers of government. The latter, including the Prime Minister, are appointed by the monarch. The Governor of Ha'apai and the Governor of Vava'u also serve on the Cabinet "ex officio". When in session and presided over by the monarch, the Cabinet is known as the Privy Council.
Current Cabinet.
The current Cabinet results from the November 2010 general election, the first enabling ordinary citizens to elect a majority of Members of Parliament, and the first also enabling Parliament to elect the Prime Minister. After being elected Prime Minister by Parliament, Lord Tuʻivakanō appointed the following as his Cabinet. His decision to appoint Dr. Ana Taufeʻulungaki and Clive Edwards, who were not Members of Parliament, was met with some controversy, but Tuʻivakanō defended his choice on the grounds of their experience. It also meant that the Ministry for Women's Affairs would be headed by a woman; as all members of the legislature were men, appointing a Member of Parliament to the position would have meant it being held by a man.
The Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands, which had won twelve of the seventeen seats allotted to people's representatives in the Assembly, requested six seats in Cabinet, but was awarded only two, generating some disagreements within the party itself. Senior party MPs ʻAkilisi Pohiva and ʻIsileli Pulu nevertheless accepted the proposed Cabinet positions.
Lord Tuʻivakanō's first Cabinet, announced at the beginning of January 2011, was thus the following. On 13 January, however, newly appointed Health Minister ʻAkilisi Pohiva (People's representative for Tongatapu 1) resigned, in protest over his party having only two Cabinet positions, and refusing to be bound by collective Cabinet responsibility. He was replaced by ʻUliti Uata (DPFI, People's Representative for Haʻapai 13) on 25 January.
On September 1, 2011, following a reshuffle which switched portfolios around without adding any new minister nor removing any, the Cabinet was as follows:
In mid-April 2012, another reshuffle was announced, to be effective from 1 May. Lisiate ʻAkolo, the Minister for Police, was to become Minister for Finance and National Planning. Sunia Fili, the Minister for Finance and Revenue, was to take over the Police, Prisons & Fire Services portfolio; Sosefo Vakata, Minister for Training, Employment, Youth and Sports, would become Minister for Revenue. Lord Vaea, in addition to retaining his Agriculture, Food, Forests and Fisheries portfolio, would take over Vakata's erstwhile ministry. The reshuffle was implemented on 1 May.
In late June, three ministers (ʻIsileli Pulu (Labour), Sunia Fili (Police) and ʻUliti Uata (Health)) resigned, so as to support a motion of no confidence tabled by their party (DPFI) against the government. On 1 July, Sangster Saulala broke ranks with the DPFI to join the government, but resigned and rejoined the opposition the next day. On 5 July, Lord Tuʻiʻafitu was appointed Minister for Health. The other vacated portfolios remained vacant; "Matangi Tonga" pointed out that "the selection is difficult because of the very few friendly members of parliament left to choose from", as the (delayed) motion of no confidence loomed. On 13 July, Saulala joined the government once more, as Minister for Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Food. He argued that, although he was breaking ranks with his own party, it was the wish of his constituents.
No further announcement was made until 7 January 2013, when Lord Tuʻivakanō announced the following Cabinet:
On 2 February 2013, there was another reshuffle. Sifa Tuʻutafaiva, DPFI MP for Tongatapu 6, was appointed Minister for Police, Prisons and Fire Services, and Minister for Revenue Services, his first ministerial appointments. Feʻaomoeata Vakata, until then Minister for Revenue Services, was shuffled to the position of Minister of Public Enterprises, replacing Clive Edwards, who retained his other position as Minister for Justice.
On 9 January 2014, Finance Minister Lisiate ‘Akolo was sacked after publicly criticising aspects of the budget. ʻAisake Eke, Independent MP for Tongatapu 5, was appointed in his place.
Past Cabinets.
Sevele Cabinet.
For the most part, the Cabinet below results from a reshuffle in May 2009, but Teisina Fuko was subsequently appointed Minister for Revenue Services in October, and Samiu Vaipulu became Minister of Justice in November. John Cauchi became Attorney General in May 2009, but resigned in April 2010.

<doc id="21354274" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21354274" title="Beatification of Pope John Paul II">
Beatification of Pope John Paul II

Pope John Paul II reigned as pope of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign of Vatican City for almost 27 years. Since his death on 2 April 2005, many thousands of people have been supporting the case for beatifying and canonising Pope John Paul II as a saint. His formal beatification ceremony took place on 1 May 2011.
Beatification.
John Paul II's official title was "Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of Saint Peter, Head of the College of Bishops, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Patriarch of the West, Primate of Italy, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City, Servus Servorum Dei, Pope John Paul II". In 2006 the title "Patriarch of the West" was removed from the papal list of titles by the succeeding pope, Benedict XVI, due to its obsolescence.
On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the beatification process for his predecessor. Normally five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, Cardinal Vicar Camillo Ruini, the one responsible for promoting the cause for canonisation of any person who dies within the diocese of Rome, cited "exceptional circumstances" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived.
The "exceptional circumstances" may possibly refer to the people's cries of "Santo Subito!" ("Saint now!" in Italian) during the pontiff's funeral. Therefore the new pope waived the five year rule "so that the cause of Beatification and Canonisation of the same Servant of God can begin immediately". The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima and the 24th anniversary of the assassination attempt on John Paul II at St. Peter's Square. John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Camillo Ruini, vicar general for the diocese of Rome, officially opened the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on 28 June 2005.
In early 2006, it was reported that the Vatican was investigating a possible miracle associated with John Paul II. A French nun, confined to her bed by Parkinson's Disease or a neurological condition with similar symptoms which can go into remission, is reported to have experienced a "complete and lasting cure after members of her community prayed for the intercession of Pope John Paul II". The nun was later identified as Sister Marie Simon-Pierre.
Sister Marie Simon Pierre is a member of the Congregation of Little Sisters of Catholic Maternity Wards from Puyricard, near Aix-en-Provence. Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, 46, is working again, now in Paris at a maternity hospital run by her order. She met reporters 30 March 2006 in Aix-en-Provence, during a press conference with Archbishop of Aix Claude Feidt.
“I was sick and now I am cured,” she told reporters. “I am cured, but it is up to the church to say whether it was a miracle or not.”
It has been suggested, however, that Sister Marie Simon-Pierre did not have Parkinson's Disease as there is no easy way to accurately diagnose the disease short of medical autopsy. Sister Marie Simon-Pierre also suffered a relapse though the Episcopal Conference of France disputed that the relapse (which would have thrown the purportedly miraculous nature of the cure into doubt) was anything more than a rumor.
On 28 May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI said Mass before an estimated 900,000 people in John Paul II's native Poland. During his homily he encouraged prayers for the early canonisation of John Paul II and stated that he hoped canonisation would happen "in the near future".
In January 2007, it was announced by Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz of Kraków, his former secretary, that the key interviewing phase in Italy and Poland of the beatification process was nearing completion. The relics of Pope John Paul II—pieces of white papal cassocks he used to wear—were being freely distributed with prayer cards for the cause to interested parties; this distribution and prayerful use of relics is a typical praiseworthy pious practice after a saintly Catholic's death.
On 8 March 2007 the Vicariate of Rome announced that the diocesan phase of John Paul's cause for beatification was at an end. Following a ceremony on 2 April 2007 – the second anniversary of the Pontiff's death – the cause proceeded to the scrutiny of the committee of lay, clerical, and episcopal members of the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, who will conduct an investigation of their own.
On the fourth anniversary of Pope John Paul's death, 2 April 2009, Dziwisz told reporters of a presumed miracle that had recently occurred at the former pope's tomb in St. Peter's Basilica. A nine year-old Polish boy from Gdańsk, who was suffering from kidney cancer and was completely unable to walk, had been visiting the tomb with his parents. On leaving St. Peter's Basilica, the boy told them, "I want to walk", and began walking normally.
In October 2009, Rome's mayor Gianni Alemanno said that the beatification, likely to draw huge crowds, was expected to take place in 2010, but on 4 November 2009 Monsignor Slawomir Oder, postulator of the cause of beatification, said that it was not yet known when study of the case could be concluded.
On 16 November 2009, a panel of reviewers at the Congregation for the Causes of Saints voted unanimously that Pope John Paul II had lived a life of virtue. If Pope Benedict XVI agrees, he will sign the first of two decrees needed for beatification. The first recognises that he lived a heroic, virtuous life and enables him to be called "Venerable", the next step in the sainthood process. That decree was signed by Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday, 19 December 2009. The second vote and the second signed decree would recognise the authenticity of his first miracle (most likely, the case of Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, the French nun who was cured of Parkinson's Disease). Once the second decree is signed, the "‘positio’" (the report on the cause, with documentation about his life and his writings and with information on the cause) is regarded as being complete. He can then be beatified. John Paul II was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on 1 May 2011.
Prior to the announcement of the beatification, some ecclesiastical authorities had expressed concern that the cure of Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, and perhaps the cure of the boy who had cancer, may not be complete and lasting, as it has not been that long since the supposed miracles. Sister Marie's symptoms were analyzed very thoroughly before the beatification was announced (by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints and its medical panel for the Pope's case) to make sure they were not actually psychogenic, or related to another disease. The medical miracle was given a positive affirmation by the Congregation and its medical and theological panels, and by Pope Benedict. It would not have counted as a miracle if the cause was psychogenic and if the immediate physiological cure had not been judged to be definitive, total, and permanent, as well as directly attributable to his intercession.
Ceremony.
The beatification ceremony of Pope John Paul II was held on 1 May 2011 and was presided over by Pope Benedict XVI. A vigil in preparation for the celebration was held the night before in the Circus Maximus. The casket in which he was interred was exhumed and placed before Saint Peter's tomb on 29 April 2011. It was placed in front of the main altar for public veneration during the ceremony. After the ceremony, the casket was reinterred in the Chapel of St Sebastian. A vial containing the Pope's blood, taken during the final days of his life, was displayed as a relic for veneration. The reliquary in which the vial was kept during the ceremony was carried by Sister Marie, and Sister Tobiann (who nursed the Pope during his illness).
A total of 87 international delegations attended the ceremony, including 22 world leaders. Amid controversy, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe also attended the ceremony despite a European Union-wide travel ban imposed on him. He was able to travel freely into the Vatican via Rome due to a treaty that allows individuals wanting to travel to the Vatican to pass through Italy. His travel ban was waived by the EU.
One million Catholics gathered for the mass at Saint Peter's Square, where a giant portrait of the former Pope was set up. The Prefecture of the Papal Household, Bishop James Michael Harvey, has issued a draft program for the Beatification of John Paul II, describing it as "a great ecclesial event," the office in charge of organising audiences and handles ticketing for all papal events at the Vatican, issued a statement that began “tickets are not needed to attend the beatification ceremony”.
The city of Rome plastered 30,000 posters around the city. A no-fly zone was enforced over Saint Peter's Square.
On 2 May 2011, following a two day viewing by hundreds of thousands of pilgrims, John Paul II's coffin was sealed within St Peters under the Altar of St. Sebastian.
Criticism of beatification.
Some Catholics question the validity of the beatification. Calling into question both the validity of the purported miracle and also asking whether the purported miracle should be attributed to John Paul II rather than the prayers of Sister Marie Simon-Pierre to any other saint. There has been criticism of the rapidity of the beatification in light of the sexual abuse scandals. Much of the abuse, or its alleged cover-up, occurred while John Paul II was Pope, from 1979–2005, and the Church has been criticised for not doing enough to punish those found responsible.
John Paul II has been criticised (more than perhaps any other issue) for not recognising the full severity of the sex abuse cases until they erupted in America in 2002. He has also been criticised for hindering the investigation into the charges of sexual immorality leveled against Father Marcial Maciel Degollado and for allowing diocesan bishops to transfer pedophile priests from one parish to another instead of reporting their crimes to the authorities. John Paul further stands accused of hindering Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who allegedly was attempting to prevent sex abuse.
Meanwhile, Pope Benedict stands accused of deliberately hushing up the abundance of public and private affection displayed between John Paul II and Father Marciel. According to the "National Catholic Reporter", a recent leak of 212 Vatican documents shows a fuller story:
"Ratzinger wanted to elevate John Paul to beatification," said Barba, coauthor of "La Voluntad de No Saber" ("The Will Not to Know"), an analysis of Vatican documents on Maciel [leaked in late 2011. The book's publication last March and Benedict's refusal to meet with Maciel victims on a trip to Mexico [in the very same month ignited an onslaught of bad press for the pope. Benedict had to reckon with the embarrassment of John Paul's praise of Maciel after the 1998 case, in essence scoffing at allegations against one of the most notorious sexual criminals in church history. By keeping a lid on Maciel's secret life, Barba said, Benedict hoped "to defend the sainthood case against the accusations that John Paul protected predators."
After the formal beatification ceremony on 1 May 2011, Pope Benedict could be more forthcoming in acknowledging the depth of Father Marciel's crimes. Meanwhile, Jason Berry has documented how the million dollar gifts of Father Marciel to John Paul II served to cement their friendship and to assure Marciel of papal immunity from prosecution.
Title "the Great".
Since the death of John Paul II, a number of clergy at the Vatican and laymen throughout the world have been referring to the pontiff as "John Paul the Great"—only the fourth pope to be so acclaimed, and the first since the first millennium. Scholars of Canon Law say that there is no official process for declaring a pope "Great"; the title simply establishes itself through popular and continued usage. The three popes who today commonly are known as "Great" are: Leo I, who reigned from 440–461 and persuaded Attila the Hun to withdraw from Rome; Gregory I, 590–604, after whom the Gregorian Chant is named; and Pope Nicholas I, 858–867.
His successor, Pope Benedict XVI, referred to him as "the great Pope John Paul II" in his first address from the loggia of St Peter's Basilica, and he referred to Pope John Paul II as "the Great" in his published written homily for the Mass of Repose.
Since giving his homily at the funeral of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI has continued to refer to John Paul II as "the Great". At the 2005 World Youth Day in Germany, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking in Polish, John Paul's native language, said, "As the great Pope John Paul II would say: keep the flame of faith alive in your lives and your people." In May 2006, Pope Benedict XVI visited John Paul's native Poland. During that visit he repeatedly made references to "the great John Paul" and "my great predecessor".
In addition to the Vatican calling him "the great", numerous books and newspapers have also done so. Journalist Peggy Noonan readily titled her book "John Paul the Great: Remembering a Spiritual Father", and Catholic writer Randall Meissen subtitles his book about the pope's influence on Catholic culture, "The Spiritual Sons of John Paul the Great." Also, the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera" called him "the Greatest" and the South African Catholic newspaper, The Southern Cross, has called him "John Paul II The Great".

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis

Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) (also known as "Pustular drug eruption," and "Toxic pustuloderma") is a not uncommon cutaneous reaction pattern that in 90% of cases is related to medication administration, characterized by a sudden eruption that appears on average five days after the medication is started.
It is mediated by T cells.
Presentation.
AGEP is an acute febrile drug eruption characterized by numerous small, primarily non-follicular, sterile pustules, arising within large areas of edematous erythema.
The eruption follows a self-limiting course and will end before a week provided the causative agent (e.g. medication) is discarded. It is accompanied by fever, neutrophilia, and sometimes by facial edema, hepatitis and eosinophilia. The mortality rate is about 5% and the differential diagnosis includes Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS). Contrary to SJS, in AGEP, mucosa are not affected, which means that there are no blisters in the mouth or vagina.
Treatment.
The treatment is (1) stop the offending drug (antibiotics), (2) symptomatic (fever) and (3) for complications (hepatitis).

1960 Gator Bowl (January)

The 1960 Gator Bowl was a post-season college football bowl game between the Southwest Conference co-champion Arkansas Razorbacks and the Yellow Jackets of Georgia Tech representing the SEC. Arkansas defeated Georgia Tech, 14-7, in front of 45,104 spectators. There were two players named Most Valuable Player: Jim Mooty of Arkansas and Maxie Baughan of Georgia Tech
Setting.
The 1960 Gator Bowl featured a second-year head coach up against his alma mater and mentor, as well as two teams that had met in a bowl game previously in the decade. Georgia Tech was 11-2 in bowl games entering the contest.
Arkansas finished their SWC schedule 5-1, losing only to #3 Texas. The Hogs also lost to #6 Ole Miss at Crump Stadium in a nonconference matchup.
Georgia Tech started 4-0, but struggled the rest of the year, losing to Auburn, Duke, and rival Georgia at home, and Alabama in Birmingham. 
The Ramblin' Wreck and Razorbacks did have a common opponent, The Mustangs of SMU (5-4-1), who GT defeated 16-12 and the Hogs beat 17-14.
Game summary.
The Ramblin' Wreck began by dominating the ball, consuming over eleven minutes before failing a field goal from the Arkansas 8 yard line. However, it took only two plays on Tech's second drive to hit pay dirt as GT quarterback Marvin Tibbetts scrambled 51 yards for a touchdown. Joe Paul Alberty scored from one yard out on the ensuing Razorback possession to tie the game at 7. Razorback rushers Lance Alworth and Jim Mooty took over in the third quarter, working in tandem to go 78 yards with Mooty finishing with a 19 yard score. 
Arkansas' record in the postseason improved to 2-1-2, with Tech dropping to 11-3.
Two members of the game would be inducted into the Gator Bowl Hall of Fame, Maxie Baughan, a center and linebacker named an All-American during 1959 from Georgia Tech, and Frank Broyles, the head coach of Arkansas.

Willows airships

The Willows airships were a series of pioneering non-rigid airships designed and built in Wales by Ernest Thompson Willows in the first decade of the 20th century. The first airship Willows No. 1 flew in 1905 and the last the Willows No. 5 in 1913.
Design and development.
Willows No. 1.
First flown for 85 minutes by the nineteen-year old Willows from East Moors, Cardiff in Wales on 5 August 1905 the No. 1 was a small semi-rigid of 12,600 cubic feet (354m³). The 74 ft (22.55m) long and 18 ft (5.5m) diameter envelope was made from silk and it had a framework gondola suspended beneath the envelope. At the rear of the framework was a twin-cylinder 7 hp Peugot motor-cycle engine fitted with a two-bladed 10 ft (3m) pusher propeller. The Willows No. 1 undertook six flights with the longest lasting two hours.
Willows No. 2.
Willows next airship the Willows No. 2 first flew on 26 November 1909. No. 2 was 86 ft (26.2 m) long and 22 ft (6.7 m) diameter with a 29,000 cubic feet (820 m³) volume. On 4 June 1910 Willows landed the No. 2 outside of Cardiff City Hall and flew back to his shed at East Moors. On 11 July 1910 it flew from Cheltenham to Cardiff and the following month on the 6 August flew from Cardiff to London. The flight was a record for a cross-country flight in Britain and Willows was the first aviator to cross the Bristol Channel in a powered aircraft. The No. 2 was powered by a JAP 30 hp air-cooled V8 engine and had two swivelling propellers mounted either side of the suspended car. It was also fitted with a rudder for directional control.
Willows No. 3 - "City of Cardiff".
Willows No. 2 was re-built and lengthened to 120 ft (36.56m) with a diameter of 40 ft (12.2m) and a volume of 32,000 cubic feet (905m³). It retained the same JAP engine which powered two 6 ft (1.83m) propellers. No. 3 first flew on 29 October 1910 over White City in London, England. Willows renamed his airship the "City of Cardiff" and on the 4 November 1910 left from Wormwood Scrubs for France. The first airship to cross the English Channel at night and the first from England to France. The journey was not without problems including dropping the maps over the side during the night and problems with the envelope caused the airship to land at Corbehem near Douai at two o'clock in the morning. With the help of a local French aviator Louis Breguet the airship was repaired and arrived at Paris on 28 December 1910. He celebrated New Year's Eve with a flight around the Eiffel Tower.
Willows No. 4 - His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2.
The next Willows airship the Willows No.4 was slightly smaller but more streamlined then the No. 3. Completed in 1912 it had a 24,000 cubic feet (680m³) capacity and a length of 110 ft (33.5m) and a diameter of 20 ft (61.m). The envelope had a keel on with was mounted a 35 hp Anzani engine driving two four-bladed steerable propellers. Below the keel was suspended a two-man gondola. After rejection by the Army, No. 4 was bought for £1,050 in September 1912 by the Admiralty and it became His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2. In 1913 it was given a larger capacity envelope of 39,000 cu feet (11000m³). By 1914 the original gondola was replaced a three-seat version with dual controls but it only made one-flight in the three-seat configuration. The envelope of this airship was used for the prototype of the very successful SS class airship which was used for anti U-boat activities in World War I.
Willows No. 5.
Following the sale of No. 4 Willows established a spherical gas balloon school at Welsh Harp, Hendon. During this time he developed a new airship the Willows No. 5 with a rubberised fabric and a volume of 50,000 cubic feet (1415m³). First flown on 27 November 1913 the No. 5 had a gondola which could carry four people. It made a number of flights from Hendon over central London in February 1914.

<doc id="21354427" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21354427" title="Human T-lymphotropic virus">
Human T-lymphotropic virus

The human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) is a human retrovirus that is known to cause a type of cancer, referred to as adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, and a demyelinating disease called HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-I is one of a group of closely related primate T lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called Human T-lymphotropic viruses, and the ones that infect old world monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (HTLV-I, HTLV-II, HTLV-III, and HTLV-IV) and four types of STLVs (STLV-I, STLV-II, STLV-III, and STLV-V) have been identified. The HTLVs are believed to originate from intraspecies transmission of STLVs. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was HTLV-III; this term is no longer in use [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/HTLV-III]. The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV.
HTLV-I.
HTLV-I is an abbreviation for "human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1", also called "adult T-cell lymphoma virus type 1", a virus that has been seriously implicated in several kinds of diseases, including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy and "Strongyloides stercoralis", and as a virus cancer link for leukemia (see adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). Between 1 in 20 and 1 in 25 infected persons are thought to develop cancer as a result of the virus.
HTLV-II.
A virus closely related to HTLV-I, HTLV-II shares approximately 70% genomic homology (structural similarity) with HTLV-I.
HTLV-III and HTLV-IV.
When HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was characterized in 1984 by Robert Gallo, he named it HTLV-III. HTLV-III is currently the name used to describe another virus related to HTLV-I and HTLV-II.
"HTLV-IV" has been used to describe recently characterized viruses.
These viruses were discovered in 2005 in rural Cameroon, and were, it is presumed, transmitted from monkeys to hunters of monkeys through bites and scratches.
It is not yet known how much further transmission has occurred among humans, or whether the viruses can cause disease.
The use of these names can cause some confusion, because the name "HTLV-III" was one of the names for HIV in early AIDS literature, but has since fallen out of use. The name "HTLV-IV" has also been used to describe HIV-2. A large Canadian study documented this confusion among healthcare workers, where >90% of HTLV tests ordered by physicians were actually intended to be HIV tests.
Transmission.
HTLV-I and HTLV-II are sexually transmitted. Breast feeding by the carrier mother may cause vertical transmission.
Research.
While there is no present licensed vaccine, there are many factors which make a vaccine against HTLV-1 feasible. The virus displays relatively low antibody production variability, natural immunity does occur in humans, and experimental vaccination using envelope antigens has been shown to be successful in animal models. Four HTLVs are well established. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are both involved in actively spreading epidemics, affecting 15-20 million people worldwide. HTLV-1 is the more clinically significant of the two, as it has been proven to be the etiologic agent of multiple disorders. At least 500,000 of the individuals infected with HTLV-1 eventually develop an often rapidly fatal leukemia, while others will develop a debilitative myelopathy, and yet others will experience uveitis, infectious dermatitis, or another inflammatory disorder. HTLV-2 is associated with milder neurologic disorders and chronic pulmonary infections. The novel HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have been isolated only in a few cases; no specific illnesses have yet been associated with these viruses. Plasmid DNA vaccines elicit potent and protective immune responses in numerous small-animal models of infectious diseases. However, their immunogenicity in primates appears less potent. In the United States, HTLV-I/II seroprevalence rates among volunteer blood donors average 0.016 percent. Approximately half of HTLV-I/II-seropositive blood donors nationwide are infected with HTLV-I. HTLV-I infected donors most often report a history of birth in HTLV-I endemic countries or sexual contact with persons from the Caribbean or Japan. In the past two decades a large initiative has been put forth to understand the biological and pathogenic properties of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1); this has ultimately led to the development of various experimental vaccination and therapeutic strategies to combat HTLV-1 infection. These strategies include the development of envelope glycoprotein derived B-cell epitopes for the induction of neutralizing antibodies, as well as a strategy to generate a multivalent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the HTLV-1 Tax antigen. A vaccine candidate that can elicit or boost anti-gp46 neutralizing antibody response may have a potential for prevention and therapy against HTLV-1 infection. Potential treatments include prosultiamine, a vitamin B-1 derivative, which has been shown to reduce viral load and symptoms; azacytidine, an anti-metabolite, which has been credited with the cure of a patient in Greece; tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor used for HIV, and phosphonated carbocyclic 2'-oxa-3'aza nucleosides (PCOANs). A newer formulation of TDF, called tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), also has promise as a treatment with less toxicity.

Daunt Books is a chain of bookshops in London, founded by James Daunt. It traditionally specialised in travel books. In 2010 it began publishing.
Bookshops.
The Marylebone High Street branch is housed in a former Edwardian bookshop with long oak galleries, graceful skylights and William Morris prints. The older section of the Marlyebone shop was completed in 1912, and was originally an antiquarian bookshop called Francis Edwards. It is alleged to be the first custom build bookshop in the world. A large, walk-in safe is also visible near the entrance to the travel gallery, and is where expensive volumes were once stored. The shop was bought by former banker James Daunt and renamed Daunt Books in 1990, now focussed on first-hand titles (especially travel-related material).
The company has branches in Chelsea, Holland Park, Cheapside, Hampstead and Belsize Park.
Specialising in travel, Daunt Books arranges its sections geographically - with guides, phrase books, travel writing, history and fiction grouped by their relevant country. Reviews have mentioned its customer service and knowledgeable staff.
Each branch organises talks by authors, with discussions. Previous events include talks by Alexander McCall Smith, Hilary Mantel, and Michael Palin.
Publishing.
In 2010, Daunt Books launched a publishing venture with Saki's Improper Stories, and has since republished several other out-of-print and new books. It intends to publish literary fiction and non-fiction, including both forgotten titles and new works.

Serum sickness-like reaction

Serum sickness-like reactions refer to adverse reactions that have similar symptoms to serum sickness, but in which immune complexes are not found.
Pathogenesis.
Serum sickness-like reaction is named for its clinical similarity to serum sickness, in which immune complexes are deposited in the skin, joints, and other organs. True serum sickness, a type III hypersensitivity reaction, results in fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias,cutaneous eruptions, gastrointestinal disturbances, proteinuria,and significant decreases in serum complement levels; it was originally described after patients were infused with equine immunoglobulins. 
In contrast, serum sickness-like reactions are specific drug reactions that are not associated with circulating immune complexes. 
Although the exact pathogenesis is poorly understood, serum sickness-like reactions are thought to originate from an abnormal inflammatory reaction that occurs in response to defective metabolism of drug byproducts generated during pharmacologic therapy; the metabolic flaw could be a maternally-inherited trait. In vivo hepatic drug biotransformation studies have shown greater lymphocyte killing in subjects with a known history of serum sickness-like reactions than in control subjects.
Diagnosis.
The reaction generally includes a constellation of fever; urticarial polycyclic wheals (a rash that can look similar to hives with small swellings that overlap each other ) with central clearing on the trunk, extremities, face, and lateral borders of the hands and feet; oral edema without mucosal involvement; lymphadenopathy; arthralgias; myalgias; and mild proteinuria. Case reports have noted the absence of fever in serum sickness-like reactions to amoxicillin. Laboratory abnormalities include normal or mild decreases in serum C3, C4, and CH50 levels, and mild proteinuria.1,3-5 In contrast to true serum sickness, renal and hepatic involvement is rare. Significant decreases in serum C3, C4, and CH50, reported in the literature for true serum sickness, are rarely described in serum sickness-like reaction.
Causes.
Agents that have been implicated in serum sickness-like reactions include cefaclor, amoxicillin, sulfonamides, tetracyclines,ciprofloxacin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
barbiturates, carbamazepine, propranolol, thiouracil, and allopurinol. Metabolites of these drugs might bind with tissue
proteins inappropriately, eliciting an acute inflammatory response that typically develops 7–14 days after initiation of
the offending agent. Acute hepatitis B will sometimes be complicated with this syndrome, often resolving as soon as the jaundice subsides.
Management.
Serum sickness-like reaction is an acute self-limited reaction with an ultimately favorable outcome. Treatment is
typically symptomatic, but hospitalization may be required for severe cases. While optimal treatment strategies for
serum sickness-like reactions are not clearly defined in the literature, discontinuation of the suspected agent combined
with use of antihistamines and corticosteroids for symptom control is an appropriate therapeutic route. Case reports
have shown that treatment with prednisone, 60 mg daily, and high doses of H1 and H2 antihistamines help resolve the
arthralgias and myalgias within 24 hours and the remaining symptoms within 48–72 hours

Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick

Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick is a 1998 play written by the English dramatist Terry Johnson, who also directed the original production at the National Theatre.
The play is about the off-screen love affair between "Carry On" film stalwarts, Barbara Windsor and Sid James.
The comedy also reveals that the filming of the Carry On series was a less than glamorous affair, characterised by leaking caravans, inadequate pay-cheques and argumentative co-stars.
Most of the play's action takes place on rain-soaked locations with a scantily-clad Barbara taking refuge in Sid's trailer while he and co-star Kenneth Williams carry on their notorious feud, which began when they starred together in the TV series "Hancock's Half Hour".
In 2000, Johnson adapted the play for television as "Cor, Blimey!".

Broad-billed moa

The Coastal Moa ("Euryapteryx curtus") was a species of moa. It is now extinct. These moa lived in both the North and the South Islands of New Zealand, and on Stewart Island. Its habitat was in the lowlands (dunelands, forests, shrublands, and grasslands). It was a ratite and a member of the Struthioniformes Order. The Struthioniformes are flightless birds with a sternum without a keel. They also have a distinctive palate. The origin of these birds is becoming clearer as it is now believed that early ancestors of these birds were able to fly and flew to the southern areas that they have been found in.
Taxonomy.
A 2009 genetic study showed that "Euryapteryx curtus" and "Euryapteryx gravis" were synonyms. A 2010 study explained size differences among them as sexual dimorphism. A 2012 morphological study interpreted them as subspecies instead.

Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma

Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLPHL) is a form of lymphoma.
It is no longer classified as a form of classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). This is because the Reed-Sternberg Cell (RSC) variants (popcorn cells) that characterize this form of the disease invariably express B lymphocyte markers such as CD20 (thus making NLPHL an unusual form of B cell lymphoma), and that (unlike classic HL) NLPHL may progress to diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 
There are small but clear differences in prognosis between the various forms. Lymphocyte predominant HL is an uncommon subtype composed of vague nodules of numerous reactive lymphocytes admixed with large popcorn-shaped RSC. Unlike classic RSC, the non-classic popcorn-shaped RS cells of NLPHL are CD15 and CD30 negative while positive for the B cell marker CD20. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab has been used in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma with encouraging results.
BCL6 gene rearrangements have been frequently observed.

Cloud (operating system)

Cloud is a browser-based operating system created by Good OS LLC, a Los Angeles-based corporation. The company initially launched a Linux distribution called gOS which is heavily based on Ubuntu, now in its third incarnation.
Overview.
Cloud is a simplified operating system that runs just a web browser, providing access to a variety of web-based applications that allow the user to perform many simple tasks without booting a full-scale operating system. Because of its simplicity, Cloud can boot in just a few seconds. The operating system is designed for Netbooks, Mobile Internet Devices, and PCs that are mainly used to browse the Internet. From Cloud the user can quickly boot into the main OS, because Cloud continues booting the main OS in the background.
Combining a browser with a basic operating system allows the use of cloud computing, in which applications and data "live and run" on the Internet instead of the hard drive.
Cloud can be installed and used together with other operating systems, or act as a standalone operating system. When used as a standalone operating system, hardware requirements are relatively low.
In 2009, Cloud was only officially available built into the GIGABYTE M912 Touch Screen Netbook.
Early reviews compared the operating system's user interface to Mac OS X and noted the similarity of its browser to Google Chrome, although it is actually based on a modified Mozilla Firefox browser.

Ernest Willows

Ernest Thompson Willows (1886–1926) was a pioneer Welsh aviator and airship builder. He became the first person in the United Kingdom to hold a pilots certificate for an airship when the Royal Aero Club awarded him "Airship Pilots Certificate No. 1".
Willows was born in Cardiff, Wales on 11 July 1886. He was educated at Clifton College in Bristol, entering the school in 1896 and leaving in 1901 aged 15 to train as a dentist. 
He built his first airship, the Willows No. 1, in 1905 when he was 19. It was first flown from East Moors, Cardiff on 5 August 1905, the flight lasting 85 minutes. This was soon followed by an improved "Willows No. 2", in which he landed outside Cardiff City Hall on 4 June 1910. No. 2 was re-built as No. 3 which he named the "City of Cardiff" before he flew it from London to Paris in 1910. This was the first airship crossing of the English Channel at night and the first from England to France. The journey was not without incident, including dropping the maps over the side during the night, and problems with the envelope caused the airship to land at Corbehem near Douai at two o'clock in the morning. With the help of the local French aviator Louis Breguet the airship was repaired and arrived at Paris on 28 December 1910. He celebrated New Year's Eve with a flight around the Eiffel Tower.
Willows moved to Birmingham to build his next airship, the "Willows No. 4". First flown in 1912, it was sold to the Admiralty for £1,050 and it became His Majesty's Naval Airship No. 2. 
With the money from the Navy Willows established a spherical gas balloon school at Welsh Harp, Hendon near London, although this did not stop him building "Willows No. 5" in 1913, a four-seater airship designed to give joy rides over London.
During the first world war Willows built kite or barrage balloons in Cardiff. After the war he continued with ballooning but on the 23 August 1926 he died in a balloon accident at Hoo Park, Kempston, Bedford along with two passengers.
There is a school named Willows High School built on his old airfield to remember him [http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willows_High_School] There is also a pub called The Ernest Willows which is situated not far from the school.

Saad National Schools (SNS) are based in Al-Khobar, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The school was established in 1995 and was inaugurated two years later under the patronage of HRH Prince Mohammad bin Fahd Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. The goal of the school is to help ensure that local children receive the best opportunities possible, in addition to an education that completely prepares them for the future. In 2000, a similar institution was established for girls, with the latter eventually achieving international accreditation.
Ethos.
The governing principles of both schools are "excellence" and "opportunity". There is a particular emphasis on the creation of an interactive and participative environment that enables students to flourish.
Curriculum.
While the SNS educational programmes fully implement the Saudi Ministry of Education's core curriculum, both schools also include a number of further subjects, activities and disciplines that aim to offer a broader range of opportunities to students. Additional subjects include French, mathematics and science, all taught in English. Pupils are also encouraged to participate in a broad range of physical activities, including swimming, horse riding and martial arts.

Rays Hill is a mountain ridge in Pennsylvania's Ridge and Valley Appalachians region. It is bordered to the east by Sideling Hill. About halfway along its run, the west side of Rays Hill ties into Broad Top Mountain, a large plateau. On its west it is bordered by Tussey Mountain south of Broad Top Mountain and Rocky Ridge north of Broad Top Mountain. 
The ridge is known both as "Rays" and "Wrays". To the north of Broad Top Mountain it is most often spelled "Wrays" and to the south most often "Rays."
The southern section holds the Rays Hill Tunnel, one of the abandoned tunnels of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The northern section holds Wrays Hill Tunnel, one of two on the East Broad Top Railroad.
This mountain ridge forms the boundary between Bedford and Fulton counties in south central Pennsylvania, and also extends northward into Huntingdon County. 
Part of Buchanan State Forest lies on Rays Hill.
Geology.
Rays Hill is held up by the Mississippian Pocono Formation, which dips to the southeast. The Mississippian-Devonian Rockwell Formation and Devonian Catskill Formation are exposed on the northwest flank of the mountain below the Pocono. Town Hill, to the west, and Rays Hill form a syncline.

Mayor of Antananarivo

The Mayor of Antananarivo is the Mayor of the capital and largest city in Madagascar, Antananarivo.
The post of mayor of Antananarivo is considered to be one of the most prominent and influential offices in Madagascar. It is also considered one of the "politically defining posts" in the country, from which politicians often emerge into higher offices, such as the Malagasy Presidency.
The former President of Madagascar, Marc Ravalomanana, was mayor of the city when he rose to power in 2002. Andry Rajoelina was elected as Mayor in December 2007 and became Ravalomanana's main opponent, leading a general strike in Antananarivo in January 2009.
On 3 February 2009, after declaring himself to be in charge of the country, Rajoelina was dismissed as Mayor and a special delegation, headed by Guy Randrianarisoa, was appointed instead. Rajoelina denounced the decision, saying that there was "no valid reason" for it and that he was prepared to face arrest if necessary; he warned that the city would "not accept this decision". At a rally on 4 February, Rajoelina described the appointment of Randrianarisoa as "an insult to the people of Madagascar"; he instead designated Michele Ratsivalaka to succeed him as Mayor and gave her his mayoral scarf. Rajoelina took power as head of state in March 2009. He later replaced Ratsivalaka with Edgard Razafindravahy, who served without vice-presidents throughout his term. He resigned in August 2013 to enter in the 2013 presidential election and the city of Antananarivo remained without leadership until December 2013, when Olga Rasamimanana was named to one of the vice-presidency positions, making her de facto mayor of Antananarivo.

Vintage Motor Cycle Club

The Vintage Motor Cycle Club (VMCC) is a UK-based vintage motorcycle club with over 17,000 members, which aims to promote and preserve all makes of motorcycles over 25 years old.
History.
The Vintage Motor Cycle Club was founded on 28 April 1946, by 38 enthusiasts at the Lounge Cafe, Hog's Back, near Guildford in Surrey, for owners of motorcycles manufactured before December 1930.
Many of the founders rode to the first meeting on vintage motorcycles and had travelled from around the country in poor weather conditions.
The first meeting had been organised by former journalist and wartime despatch rider, the late 'Titch' Allen,
with the aim of promoting the use and preservation of vintage motorcycles manufactured prior to 31 December 1930. The club's activities have expanded over the years to include rallies, hill climbs, trials, a workshop and museum, a library, a sales and wants system for spares and motorcycles, insurance for difficult cases and an annual dinner.
VMCC today.
All makes are catered for regardless of the country of origin. The VMCC has also broadened the 1930 rule to include all motorcycles over 25 years old and has also set up a Post-1960 Section for motorcycle manufactured between 1961 and 1981. Most significantly, it is no longer necessary to own a motorcycle to join the club, which has developed into an organisation for anyone interested in older two-wheelers.

Chafed Elbows

Chafed Elbows is a 1966 film directed by Robert Downey, Sr.
A manic comic parody made for $12,000, "Chafed Elbows" was a commercial success that raised the flag of the underground film scene and elevated the good cause of bad taste. Downey photographed most of the movie with a still 35mm camera and had the film processed at Walgreens drugstore. These pictures were animated alongside a few live-action scenes and almost all the dialogue was dubbed to rather hilarious effect. One scene was even shot in Anthology Film Archives’s upstairs theater back in the days when the building was still a defunct downtown courthouse. An ingenious comedy with a rare visual sensibility, comic-book playfulness and cheeky bad attitude.
All 13 of the female roles were played by Elsie Downey, Robert Downey's wife, and the lead male role by George Morgan.
Plot.
Hapless Walter Dinsmore undergoes his annual November breakdown at the 1954 World’s Fair, has a love affair with his mother, recollects his hysterectomy operation, impersonates a cop, is sold as a piece of living art, goes to heaven, and becomes the singer in a rock band, but not necessarily in that order.

Wing wall

A wing wall (also "wingwall" or "wing-wall") is a smaller wall attached or next to a larger wall or structure.
Bridges.
In a bridge, the wing walls are adjacent to the abutments and act as retaining walls. They are generally constructed of the same material as those of abutments. The wing walls can either be attached to the abutment or be independent of it. Wing walls are provided at both ends of the abutments to retain the earth filling of the approaches. Their design period depends upon the nature of the embankment and does not depend upon the type or parts of the bridge.
The soil and fill supporting the roadway and approach embankment are retained by the wing walls, which can be at a right angle to the abument or splayed at different angles. The wing walls are generally constructed at the same time and of the same materials as the abuments.
Classification of wing walls.
Wing walls can be classified according to their position in plan with respect to banks and abutments. The classification is as follows:
1.Straight Wing walls: 
They are used for small bridges, on drains with low banks and for railway bridges in cities (weep holes are provided).
2. Splayed Wing walls: 
These are used for bridges across rivers. They provide smooth entry and exit to the water. The splay is usually 45°. Their top width is 0.5 m, face batter 1 in 12 and back batter 1 in 6, weep holes are provided.
3. Return Wing walls: 
They are used where banks are high and hard or firm. Their top width is 1.5 m and face is vertical and back battered 1 in 4. Scour can be a problem for wing walls and abutments both, as the water in the stream erodes the supporting soil.
Other uses.
Wing walls provide smooth entry of water into the bridge site and provide support and protect the embankment. Wing walls can serve as buttresses to support walls. They can also be purely decorative.

United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2002

The 2002 United States Senate election in New Jersey was held on November 5, 2002. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Robert Torricelli decided to retire. Democrat Frank Lautenberg won the open seat.
Campaign.
First-term Senator Robert Torricelli dropped out of the race on September 30 due to ethical problems and poor poll numbers against Doug Forrester, a relatively unknown opponent. The New Jersey Democratic Party endorsed former Senator Frank Lautenberg after Torricelli dropped out. In the case of "The New Jersey Democratic Party v. Samson", 175 N.J. 178 (2002), Forrester sued to stop Democratic Party efforts to have Frank Lautenberg replace Torricelli. The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled unanimously on October 2 that the party could switch Lautenberg's name in for Sen. Torricelli's on the ballot.

John F. Francis

John F. Francis (Philadelphia, August 13, 1808 – Jeffersonville, November 15, 1886) was an American painter, primarily of still lifes. 
He was born in Philadelphia. Predominantly self-taught as an artist, he worked until 1845 as a portrait painter in central and eastern Pennsylvania. Francis's portraits reveal his early fascination with the most minute details. In 1845, Francis began exhibiting his works at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Art Union, which promoted American artists by awarding paintings to subscribers using lottery-like drawings. It was in this period that he began to concentrate on still lifes, which had been established as a popular genre in Philadelphia by Raphaelle Peale and other painters. His first known still life is dated 1850, and by 1854 he ceased to paint anything else. Francis became known as a leading practitioner of luncheon and dessert still life paintings, developing an intricate vocabulary of forms required by his specialized subject. William H. Gerdts writes: "Of all the mid-century still-life specialists, Francis was the most painterly. There is often a freshness and a brio to his paint application that successfully balance his sure delineation of form and his establishment of texture".
Nearly all his paintings depict fruits and desserts. He painted many replicas of his works, and his style underwent little change over the course of his career. According to art historian Alfred Frankenstein, "his blond, high-keyed palette always provides one of the most distinctive accents in a general exhibition of American still life". Few of his paintings can be dated after 1872 and none after 1880. He was mainly forgotten by the time of his death in 1886.

Gustav Geley

Dr. Gustav Geley was a French physician, psychical researcher and director of the Institute Metapsychique International from 1919 to 1924.
Career.
Geley was born in 1868 at Montceau-les-Mines, France. He studied medicine at the Salpêtrière Hospital with the great French anatomist Jean-Martin Charcot, who also mentored Sigmund Freud. His first book: "l'Etre Subconscient," published in 1899 in Paris, predicated a theory of dynamo-psychism, a sort of internal "soul energy,". He was a critic of naturalistic theories of evolution and his second book, "From the Unconscious to the Conscious," developed this into a more comprehensive theory in which he insisted that the phenomenon of "trance mediumship" was a "direct route" to this "soul energy."
According to some authors, Geley was a very keen, objective investigator and insisted on conducting his investigations under fraud-proof conditions that included both himself and a medium being chained and handcuffed during seances. Spiritist sources consider his paraffin casts of Polish medium Franek Kluski to be compelling proof of the paranormal. After a series of experiments with Kluski in Warsaw, Poland, Geley died in an airplane accident on July 15, 1924. He was 56.

Hanna Kulenty

Hanna Kulenty (born Białystok, March 18, 1961) is a Polish composer of contemporary classical music. Since 1992, she has worked and lived both in Warsaw (Poland) and in Arnhem (Netherlands).
Musical education.
After studying piano at the Karol Szymanowski School of Music in Warsaw from 1976 to 1980, Kulenty studied composition with Włodzimierz Kotoński at the Fryderyk Chopin Music Academy in Warsaw. From 1986 to 1988 she studied composition with Louis Andriessen at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague. In 1984 and 1988 she participated in Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music. In 1983 and 1990 she was participant in the International Courses for Young Composers in Kazimierz, organised by the Polish section of the ISCM — where she attended lectures with Iannis Xenakis, Witold Lutosławski, Thomas Kessler and François-Bernard Mâche.
Main activities.
From 1989 Kulenty worked as a free-lance composer, and received numerous commissions and scholarships. She has composed 2 operas and 12 works for large orchestra. She has written numerous works for solo instruments and chamber groups. Since 2007 she is also involved in writing music for television plays and for film. 
In 1990 she was for one year guest composer at the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in Berlin. In 1998 she was invited as guest lecturer at three universities around Los Angeles.In 1999/2000 she was composer-in-residence with Het Gelders Orkest in the Netherlands. In November 2000 a portrait concert was organized by Deutschlandfunk in Cologne (released on the CD ‘Arcs & Circles’). She lectured at the Other Minds 10 festival (San Francisco) and at Soundstreams Canada 2005 in Toronto. In 2007 she was guest professor at the ESMUC, Music Academy in Barcelona.
She was a jury member during Munich Biennale in 1995, during the Gaudeamus International Composers Award 2002 in Amsterdam, during the Kazimierz Serocki 9th International Composers’ Competition in Warsaw (2003), during the International New Chamber Opera Competition “Orpheus-Luciano Berio 2003-2004” in Spoleto, and in 2005 and 2007 during the International Competition of Contemporary Chamber Music in Cracow.
Style and technique of composition.
“Hanna Kulenty’s music is permeated with images of organic transformation and growth. The intuitive shaping of evolving sound patterns, extended phrases and richly detailed textures in these works results from Kulenty’s original compositional technique which she calls ‘the polyphony of arches’ or ‘arcs’. The works include many layers of simultaneous ‘arches’ which may begin at different points of their trajectories and proceed at different speeds. 
Her compositional style has evolved during the years since her dazzling orchestral debut, "Ad Unum", a powerful, dissonant, dramatic and well-crafted study of convergence towards musical unity. Since that work, Kulenty’s preferred medium has been the symphony orchestra. 
Through the 1990s the composer developed an original version of ‘post-minimalist’ style, characterized by a reduction of the number and density of musical layers, in comparison with the earlier, saturated and dramatic style of the ‘polyphony of arches’. She called this style her version of the ‘European trance music’. Kulenty seldom used sudden textural cuts and shifts in this period. Instead, she often structured her compositions as single, powerful arches, slowly evolving in time, gradually increasing their gripping intensity of emotion.
Her penchant for musical drama and intensity of emotion found a suitable expression in her music for stage. The ‘intuitive constructivism’ coupled with a heightened emotional intensity of her music is well-suited for highlighting dramatic situations. Kulenty’s mastery of time and her ability to structure her musical material into layers moving inexorably, inevitably towards powerful climaxes brings a symphonic dimension to her other theatrical compositions. 
Kulenty’s latest compositional technique of the ‘polyphony of time dimensions’ emphasizes the circularity of time and the simultaneity of time-events occurring on different temporal planes.” 
Awards.
In 1985 Kulenty was awarded the second prize of the European Young Composers’ Competition organized in Amsterdam with Ad Unum for orchestra (1985). 
In 1987 she was awarded the Stanislaw Wyspianski Award (2nd class). 
In the same year she was awarded the second prize by the Young Composers’ Competition of the Polish Composers’ Union with Ride for 6 percussionists (1987). 
She was also awarded prizes in the Composers’ Competition from the Warsaw branche of the Polish Composers’ Union: Quinto for 2 piano’s (1986), first prize; Breathe for string orchestra (1987), first prize;Cannon for violin and piano (1988) third prize; aaa TRE for viola, cello and double bass (1988) second prize 1989. 
In 2003 her composition Trumpet Concerto (2002) won the first prize at UNESCO’s 50th International Rostrum of Composers, for which she received the UNESCO Mozart Medal from the International Music Council. 
Her compositions Preludium, Postludium and Psalm, for cello and accordion (2007) and String Quartet No. 3 - Tel me about it (2008), were respectively chosen among the ten best Dutch compositions of 2007 and 2008 during the ‘Toonzetters’ contest in Amsterdam.
About the performances.
Kulenty’s compositions have been premiered at festivals throughout the world, such as the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, Munich Biennale, Warsaw Autumn, and Musica Polonica Nova. Her numerous orchestral pieces have been performed by symphony orchestras in the Netherlands (Radio Filharmonisch Orkest), Denmark (Danish National Symphony Orchestra), Poland, and Germany (Radio-Symphonie-Orchester Berlin), with conductors such as David Porcelijn, Antoni Wit, Peter Hirsch, Peter Eötvös, Ingo Metzmacher, Renato Rivolta, and Ronald Zollman. Soloists such as Isabelle van Keulen, Elisabeth Chojnacka, Krzysztof Bąkowski, Marco Blaauw, and Frank Peters have performed her work, as have the Dutch ensemble De Ereprijs, who commissioned her to write pieces on several occasions. In 2008 the Kronos Quartet performed her String Quartet No. 4. Since the success of her opera "The Mother of Black-Winged Dreams" at the Munich Biennale 1996 she is considered “one of the leading figures on the Polish composers’ scene”. 
Kulenty’s compositions are published by Donemus (part of Music Center the Netherlands) in Amsterdam and by PWM Edition in Cracow.

The Memphis connection for the "Morning Star" was added to permit Cotton Belt passenger trains to readily connect with the new "Tennessean" which had been inaugurated by Southern Railway in 1941. The "Morning Star" was replaced by unnamed train numbers 7 and 8 in November 1952, as a part of extensive passenger train restructuring by St. Louis Southwestern.

Puro Tango Blast

Puro Tango Blast, or Tango Blast, is a term used to collectively describe various regionally based gangs of generally Hispanic men from major Texas cities. 
History.
Incarcerated Hispanic men from major Texas cities (including Houston, San Antonio, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Austin, El Paso, Corpus Christi, Rio Grande Valley, and West Texas) have banded together for protection from established security threat groups like Mexikanemi and the Texas Syndicate. Each regional group is individually called a Tango. The term Tango Blast, in actuality, does not refer to a separate group; rather, it refers to the idea that a particular Tango member is more criminally active than others. Some Tango members say that Tango is an acronym for "Together Against Negative Gang Organizations"; however, Tango originally meant something like 'hometown clique.'
Structure.
Although often referred to as a prison gang, Tango Blast is different than traditional prison gangs such as Mexikanemi and the Texas Syndicate, lacking the typically strict hierarchy of those organizations. The Texas Department of Public Safety classifies Tango Blast as a "loose affiliation" gang, with "relaxed membership requirements and little to no 
detectable leadership hierarchy." The El Paso County sheriff's officials have noted that "there is no known formal organization of the gang on El Paso streets." While those more structured organizations, known as Security Threat Groups, will have a variety of structures, Tango members in a particular area of a correctional facility will elect a silla (Spanish for "chair"), to speak for that area of the facility. There is no consistent pathway for initiation into a Tango; rather, each individual set of Tango members determines who it admits and by what methods. One initiation method is called a "Cora Check" or a test of heart in which the potential member must engage in physical combat with 2 or more members, provided that he does not surrender during the melee he is inducted to the gang. Members are not required to perform gang activity when released from prison, making Tangos more popular among younger people.
Individual Tangos.
While it is commonly believed that there are only four chapters to the gang, other regions of the state have their own Tangos. Collectively, the tangos from Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston. are known as the 4 Horsemen. Individual Tango members use regionally appropriate symbols as tattoos to identify the tango to which they belong. Generally, Tango members identify themselves by sport team logos or area codes from their home town or region. Houstone members, who are from Houston, often use the Houston Astros star. D-Town members, who are from Dallas, may use the Dallas Cowboys star, Foritos members, who are also known as Foros and are from Fort Worth, often use the 817 area code, a star with 817 in the center similar to a pentagram. ATX or La Capirucha (meaning The Capital) members, who are from Austin, may use the Texas Capitol building. These four Tangos represent the earliest Tangos to form. Other areas of Texas have their own Tangos, notably West Texas (Puro West or Wesos, often displaying 806 or 432, 23-20, the word West, or a WT in tattoos), the Valley (Vallucos), San Antonio (Orejones), Corpus Christi (Corpitos), and El Paso (Chucos or EPT).
Media.
History, in their series "Gangland", dedicated an episode to a description of Puro Tango Blast in episode 11 of season 5.

Early history of Tajikistan

This article documents the early history of Tajikistan. 
Before the Soviet era, which began in Central Asia in the early 1920s, the area designated today as the Republic of Tajikistan underwent a series of population changes that brought with them political and cultural influences from the Turkic and Mongol peoples of the Eurasian steppe, China, Iran, Russia, and other contiguous regions. The Tajik people came fully under Russian rule after a series of military campaigns that began in the 1860s, at the end of the nineteenth century.
Ethnic background.
Iranian peoples, including ancestors of the modern Tajiks, have inhabited Central Asia since at least the earliest recorded history of the region, which began some 2,500 years ago. Contemporary Tajiks are the descendants of ancient Eastern Iranian inhabitants of Central Asia, in particular the Soghdians, Xorasmians and the Bactrians, and possibly other groups, with an admixture of Western Iranian Persians (see Glossary) and non-Iranian peoples. The ethnic contribution of various Turkic and Mongol peoples, who entered Central Asia at later times, has not been determined precisely. However, experts assume that some assimilation must have occurred in both directions.
The origin of the name Tajik has been embroiled in twentieth-century political disputes about whether Turkic or Iranian peoples were the original inhabitants of Central Asia. The explanation most favored by scholars is that the word evolved from the name of a pre-Islamic (before the seventh century A.D.) Arab tribe.
Until the 20th century, people in the region used two types of distinction to identify themselves: way of life—either nomadic or sedentary—and place of residence. By the late nineteenth century, the Tajik and Uzbek peoples, who had lived in proximity for centuries and often used each other's languages, did not perceive themselves as two distinct nationalities. Consequently, such labels were imposed artificially when Central Asia was divided into five Soviet republics in the 1920s.
