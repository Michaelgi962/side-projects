Count the Stars

Count the Stars was a four-piece pop punk band from Albany, New York that formed in 1995. After recording two albums, one with Chicago's Victory Records, the band split up in late 2003.
Biography.
Count the Stars formed after the breakup of Chris Kasarjian, David Shapiro, and Clarke Foley's old band from high school. They had decided they wanted to make music their primary focus in life so Chris began writing new songs with David Shapiro and Clarke Foley. Adam Manning, a long time friend from another local band, joined them completing the band’s lineup.
As an unsigned band, they recorded “Another Useless Night," their first album, and released it on Dreamsand Records, selling upward of 5,000 copies. They went to malls and local shows to promote the new album and developed a strong underground following.
The band signed to the Chicago based Victory Records. They then recorded the early 2003 release "Never Be Taken Alive". After the release, they toured with bands such as Taking Back Sunday, The Early November, Fall Out Boy, and Copeland. They also appeared on the Vans Warped Tour. Their touring came to an abrupt stop when they were in a van accident in September 2003. After the accident, they soon embarked on a full US tour at the beginning of November, which was cut short when the band suddenly and officially broke up on November 30, 2003. The band stated that they were not compelled to continue their musical effort. They also made it clear that they would not point fingers or give out specific details as to why they split.
Clarke Foley and Adam Manning both went on to become members of the bands The Reunion Show and Action Action.

Eduardo Lim

Eduardo C. Lim (1930–2002), also known as Eddie Lim, is a former basketball player like fellow San Beda Red Lions and Hall of Famers Carlos Loyzaga and Antonio Genato. He was a formidable guard who earned the moniker "Stonewall" from legendary sportscaster Willie Hernandez. He sparked San Beda to the NCAA championships in 1951-52 and the National Open tournament, also in 1952. In the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, Lim played a key role for multi-titled YCO that won the National Open crown a record seven straight time under coaches Leo Prieto and the late Tito Eduque.
Lim, a two-time Olympian, played on two Asian Games gold medal teams in 1954 and 1958. He saw action for the Philippine selection that finished ninth at the 1959 FIBA World Championship in Chile. A hard-nosed guard, Lim led San Beda to back-to-back NCAA titles as a collegian. After hanging up his sneakers, Lim went on to become a successful businessman, chairman of the Makati Stock Exchange, and since 1995, chairman emeritus of the Philippine Stock Exchange.

All the Way, Boys

All The Way, Boys () is a 1973 Italian film starring the popular comedy team of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer.
Plot.
Salud (Bud Spencer) and Plata (Terence Hill) eke out a living as bush pilots in South America. They fake plane crashes in order to collect the insurance money, but one time the plane crashes for real in the middle of the jungle. There they find a diamond mining community operated by Mr. Ears (Reinhard Kolldehoff). Plata and Salud decide to make a living by competing against Mr. Ears, making delivery services by airplane. Salud meets with an old man (Cyril Cusack) in the village, where he takes him to see a mountain and tells him the story of three friends who killed themselves, and why. The story involves the mystery behind the old man's story, and various slapstick fights with Mr. Ears, who dislikes the competition.
The film though in true vein of most of the famous duo's movies has some quite memorable moments for being poignant as seen in the scenes where each Plata and Salud had thought the other was dead and also when Cyril had died. Another quite liberated and moving scene wherein Plata asks the local Lady cook to dance with him to demonstrate to Salud where they were, a beautiful song and dance ensued followed by Plata saying to Salud "now do you know where we are?"

Three of a Kind (TV series)

Three of a Kind was a British comedy sketch show starring comedians Tracey Ullman, Lenny Henry and David Copperfield. Three series were made by the BBC between 1981 and 1983.
The show bolstered the careers of Ullman and Henry, as well as being an outlet for young writers including Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, Ian Hislop and Nick Revell.
Ullman and Henry went on to greater success after the show, with Ullman initially launching a brief but successful pop career in 1983 before starring in the ITV sitcom "Girls On Top" in 1985 and then going on to a high profile career on American television. Henry was given his own BBC series "The Lenny Henry Show" in 1984 and he remains a semi-regular fixture on British television to this day. Copperfield, however, garnered less success and has been seen relatively little since the series ended.
Commercial releases.
Video and DVD.
A single video of the show, entitled "Three of a Kind" and released under the "Best of British Comedy" banner, appeared in 1988 from 20th Century Fox. It contained the four episodes of the first series edited together into one programme without the musical guest performances.
The same video was released earlier in the UK in 1985 by BBC Video and rereleased in 1998 under Paradox Videos. In 2005 and 2006, DVDs of each series were released in the United Kingdom by 2entertain/BBC Worldwide.

Odell Barnes (criminal)

Odell Barnes, Jr. (March 22, 1968 – March 1, 2000) was a Texas man convicted of the 1989 murder of Helen Bass. During the later stages of Barnes' legal appeals, human rights groups and anti-death penalty advocates raised questions about Barnes' murder conviction, leading to international media attention and diplomatic protests from the government of France. Barnes was executed on March 1, 2000.
Murder and conviction.
The murder occurred on November 29, 1989 in Wichita Falls, Texas. Bass, 42, was surprised by Barnes, who had broken into her home while she was at work, then robbed, beaten, stabbed, and killed by a gunshot to the head. She may have also been raped.
Barnes's conviction was based on forensic evidence and witness testimony placing him at the crime scene. His fingerprints were on a bedside lamp that was used to bludgeon Bass, traces of his semen were present at the scene, and two patches of blood on his clothing were confirmed by DNA analysis to have been hers. Prosecution witnesses described seeing Barnes trespassing in Bass's yard about one hour before she returned from work. When arrested, he was in possession of a .32 caliber pistol belonging to Bass. Barnes had previously done construction work on Bass's house.
Barnes had a prior record for two robberies. He had been unable to afford his own lawyers and the Wichita County Public Defender's office was not equipped to handle his case, so two local attorneys were appointed for him. Their budget and preparation was minimal, no defense investigation was conducted, and no forensic tests were ordered by the defense. Barnes was convicted by the jury after three hours of deliberation and sentenced to death shortly after. After his murder conviction he was also tried and convicted for two rapes, robberies and assaults for which he confessed. On Nov. 15 1989, 15 days before the murder, he beat and attempted to rape a pregnant woman. (The additional convictions were meant to ensure Barnes would stay in prison without possibility of parole even if his death sentence was later overturned.)
Appeals process.
During Barnes' appeals process, two new attorneys were appointed to his case by a Federal court. European anti-death penalty activists contributed some $16,000 to his defense fund, and the new lawyers paid for forensic tests out of their own pocket. The new defense team uncovered deficiencies in the forensic evidence, serious errors and oversights by the original defense team, and problems with the credibility of prosecution witnesses.
International attention.
Barnes was executed on March 1, 2000. For his last meal, he requested "Justice, Equality, World Peace". His final statement was:

Sarah Thomas (librarian)

Sarah Elizabeth Thomas is a university librarian. In May 2013 it was announced that she has been appointed vice president for Harvard University Library, taking up the post in August. Previously she held the office of Bodley's Librarian and Director of the Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford since February 2007. She is responsible for the operation of the largest university libraries in the United Kingdom, and one of the major research libraries in the world.
Thomas was raised in Haydenville, Massachusetts, United States, and graduated from Smith College in 1970. She qualified as a professional librarian at Simmons College in 1973 and received her Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1982 for a thesis on the Austrian author Hugo von Hofmannsthal and his relations with his publisher.
Between 1996 and 2006, Thomas held the positions of Adjunct Professor of German and Carl A. Kroch University Librarian at Cornell University. Her previous experience in major United States research libraries included Harvard's Widener Library, Johns Hopkins, the National Agricultural Library, the Library of Congress, and the Research Libraries Group.
She is the first woman to hold the position of Bodley's Librarian, and the second librarian (after her predecessor, Reginald Carr) also to be in charge of the university's integrated library service (known as "Oxford University Library Services" when it was established in 2000, but renamed "Bodleian Libraries" on 2 March 2010 – Bodley's 465th birthday). Thomas, an American, is also the first foreign librarian to run the Bodleian. In an interview she gave shortly after taking up the position, she recalled visiting Oxford when she was working at the Library of Congress to speak at the Sheldonian Theatre. She said that she remembered thinking "I could just die then and be happy". When recruitment consultants approached her about applying for the post and she saw the job description, she said, "it was love at first sight. It was everything I wanted to do, but bigger. Integration, the digital library, the estates programme, the opportunity to be inside a truly magnificent institution and have a role at a pivotal moment in its history – that was just too enticing for me."
In 2007, Thomas was awarded the Melvil Dewey Medal of the American Library Association, and in 2010 was awarded the Smith College Medal. She was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2013.
Thomas is married to Peter B. Hirtle, an archivist. They have two sons.

Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen v United Kingdom

Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen v United Kingdom [http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/2007/184.html ECHR 184 was a landmark case before the European Court of Human Rights and upheld the right of ASLEF, a British trade union, to be able to choose its members.
Facts.
The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) is an independent trade union representing mainly train drivers employed on the UK railways. One of ASLEF's aims is,
In 1978, ASLEF's governing body, the Annual Assembly of Delegates, passed a resolution to campaign against and "expose the obnoxious policies of political parties such as the National Front". In February 2002, Jay Lee, a member of the British National Party which had grown from the NF, joined ASLEF. In April 2002, Lee stood as a candidate for the BNP in the Bexley local elections. On 17 April 2002, an ASLEF officer sent a report on Lee to the union's General Secretary, including information that Lee was a BNP activist, had distributed anti-Islamic leaflets and that in 1998 he had been a BNP candidate in Newham. Attached was an article written by Lee for "Spearhead", the BNP magazine, and a fax from the Bexley Council for Racial Equality stating that Lee had seriously harassed Anti-Nazi League pamphleteers. On 19 April 2002, the Executive Committee of ASLEF voted unanimously to expel Lee, on the grounds that his membership of the BNP was incompatible with membership of ASLEF, that he was likely to bring the union into disrepute and that he was against the objects of the union.
Judgment.
Domestic appeals.
Jay Lee took ASLEF to the Employment Tribunal to contest his expulsion, under section 174 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which prohibits unions from excluding or expelling persons wholly or to any extent on the ground that the individual is or was a member of a political party. He was successful in his case.
ASLEF appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal which overturned the earlier decision, finding that a union could expel a member on the ground of his or her conduct, and referred the case to a second Employment Tribunal. However, the second tribunal upheld Lee's complaint, saying that his expulsion had been "primarily because of his membership of the BNP". ASLEF was therefore forced to re-admit Lee as a member, in breach of its own rules. Failure to re-admit would have meant paying compensation of at least €8,600. Even though it re-admitted Lee, ASLEF remained exposed to a claim for compensation of up to €94,200. ASLEF lodged an application with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR, in Strasbourg) on 24 March 2005. The complaint relied on Article 11 of the European Convention of Human Rights (freedom of assembly and association), which states,
ASLEF's case was that the union had been prevented from expelling a member due to his membership of the BNP, a political party which advocates views inimical to its own, and that this was an infringement of freedom of association. The nature of the argument is that the United Kingdom's law (i.e. s.174 of TULRCA 1992) which required ASLEF to take back Lee into union membership or face compensation payments, violates union members' freedom of association. So ASLEF was now suing the UK government (rather than Lee).
European Court of Human Rights.
Finding in ASLEF's favour, the Court held unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 11 and awarded the union 53,900 euros for costs and expenses.
The Court held that just as a worker should be free to join or not join a union, so is a trade union equally free to choose its members. Article 11 could not be interpreted as imposing obligations on associations to admit anyone who applied to join. Further, where associations are set up by people who share common values, ideals and goals, it would run counter to the very effectiveness of the freedom at stake if they had no control over their membership.
The Court's view was that the United Kingdom had not struck the right balance between Lee's right and the rights of ASLEF. The Court was persuaded that expulsion did not impinge in any significant way on Lee's freedom of expression or political activity, nor would he suffer any detriment: there being no 'closed shop' there was no apparent prejudice to him in terms of employment or livelihood.
Of greater weight was the union's right to choose its members. Trade unions in the UK and Europe were commonly affiliated to political parties or movements, particularly those on the left. They were not "bodies solely devoted to the politically-neutral aspects of the well-being of their members, but were often ideological with strongly held views". There had been no suggestion in the Employment Tribunal hearings that ASLEF had erred in concluding that Lee's political values and ideals fundamentally clashed with its own.
The United Kingdom government had argued that UK law would have allowed Lee's expulsion if ASLEF had restricted itself to a complaint solely about Lee's conduct. However, the Court noted that the Employment Tribunal found that ASLEF's objections were primarily based on his BNP membership, and the Court thought it unreasonable to expect ASLEF to use the pretext of a complaint about conduct, since this was carried out by him in the context of his membership of the BNP.
In the absence of any hardship suffered by Lee or any abusive and unreasonable conduct by ASLEF, the Court held that there had been a violation of Article 11 and found in favour of ASLEF.
Significance.
Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, described the court's decision as an ‘important and welcome judgment’, saying that it was "common sense" that unions "should not be forced to accept into membership people opposed to the basic principles of trade unionism." He added, "Every union will welcome this clear decision that they can now expel BNP members."
ASLEF General secretary Keith Norman thanked the 18 unions who gave ASLEF financial assistance to allow them to go to the European courts: NUM, CYWU, PFA, UCATT, NATFHE, NAPO, USDAW, EIS, RMT, UNISON, PCS, NUMAST, Community, CWU, CSP, GMB, FBU and NUJ.

Spin kit

A spin kit is a kit for a sailplane to make it spin. The kit consists of ballast weights (usually discs) applied to the tail to move the center of gravity rearward. This increases the instability of the glider, enabling it to spin.
A few sailplanes are very difficult, if not impossible, to spin under normal conditions. To make these sailplanes spin easily, for training purposes or demonstrations, a spin kit is available from the manufacturer.

General glut

In macroeconomics, a general glut is an excess of supply in relation to demand, specifically, when there is more production in all fields of production in comparison with what resources are available to consume (purchase) said production.
This exhibits itself in a general recession or depression, with high and persistent underutilization of resources, notably unemployment and idle factories.
The Great Depression is often cited as an archetypal example of a general glut.
The term dates to the beginnings of classical economics in the late 18th century, and there is a long-running debate on the existence, causes, and solutions of a general glut. Some classical and neoclassical economists argue that there are no general gluts, advocating a form of Say's law (conventionally but controversially phrased as "supply creates its own demand"), and that any idling is due to misallocation of resources "between" sectors, not overall because overproduction in one sector necessitates underproduction in others as is demonstrable in severe price falls when such alleged 'malinvestment' in gluts clear–unemployment is seen as voluntary, or a transient phenomenon as the economy adjusts. Others cite the frequent and recurrent economic crises of the economic cycle as examples of a general glut, propose various causes and advocate various solutions, most commonly fiscal stimulus (government deficit spending), a view advocated in the 19th and early 20th century by underconsumptionist economists, and in the mid to late 20th and 21st century by Keynesian economics and related schools of economic thought.
One can distinguish between those who see a general glut (greater supply than demand) as a supply-side issue, calling it "overproduction" (excess production), and those who see it as a demand-side issue, calling it "underconsumption" (deficient consumption). Some believe that both of these occur, such as Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi, one of the earliest modern theorists of the economic cycle.
Classical economic theory.
Introduction.
The general glut problem is identified within the classical political economy of the era of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. The problem is that, as labor becomes specialized, if people want a higher standard of living, they must produce more. However, producing more lowers prices and leads to the need to produce yet more in response. If those who have money choose not to spend it, then it is possible for a national economy to become glutted with all of the goods it produces, and still be producing more in hopes of overcoming the deficit. While Say's Law supposedly dealt with this problem, successive economists came up with new scenarios which could throw an economy out of General equilibrium, or require expansion through conquest, which became termed imperialism.
The nature of the general glut.
In Classical Economics, the basic case is of maximizing return on investment whereas only as a secondary consideration would be the contribution of private personal spending apart from investment consideration. As such, following Classical Economics, a general glut is, in the basic case, over time, inevitable except in so far as Say's Law, that savings always equals investment, is proved.
Say's law.
According to French economist Jean-Baptiste Say, the concentration of wealth into resources dedicated to savings and re-investment simply adds to the ability of consumption to consume more. And so, he states, there can be no general glut.
Malthus's solution.
Thomas Malthus proposed that a glut of production localised in time rather than by industry or field of production would meet the requirement of Say's Law that general gluts cannot exist and yet would constitute just such a general glut. The consequences then are worked out by Malthus, although Simond de Sismondi first proposed this problem before him. Ironically, Malthus is more famous for his earlier writings which tried to prove the opposite problem, a general over-consumption, as an inevitability to be lived with rather than solved.
Keynesian.
Keynesian economics, and underconsumptionism before it, argue that fiscal stimulus in the form of government deficit spending can solve general gluts.
This is a "demand" side theory, rather than the supply-side theory of classical economics; the fundamental ideas are that savings in a recession or depression causes the paradox of thrift (excess saving, or more pejoratively, "hoarding"), causing a deficit of effective demand, yielding a general glut. Keynes locates the cause in sticky wages and liquidity preference.
Marxian.
Karl Marx's(1910) critique of Malthus started from a position of agreement. Marx's idea of capitalist production, however, is characterized by his concentration on the division of labor and his notion that goods are produced for sale and not for consumption or exchange. In other words, goods are produced simply for the intention of transforming output into money to purchase other commodities. The possibility of a lack of effective demand, therefore, is held only in the possibility that there might be a time lag between the sale of a commodity (the acquisition of money) and the purchase of another (its disbursement). This possibility, also originally crafted by Sismondi (1819), endorsed the idea that the circularity of transactions was not always complete and immediate. If money is held, Marx contended, even if for a little while, there is a breakdown in the exchange process and a general glut can occur. 
For Marx, since investment is part of aggregate demand, and the stimulus for investment is profitability, accumulation will continue unhindered as far as profitability is high. However, Marx saw that profitability had a tendency to fall, which would lead to a crisis in which insufficient investment generates an insufficiency of demand and a glut of markets. The crisis itself would operate to raise profitability, which would start a new period of accumulation. This would be the mechanism for crisis occurring repeatedly.
Post-Keynesian.
Some Post-Keynesian economists see the cause of general gluts in the bursting of credit bubbles, particularly speculative bubbles. In this view, the cause of a general glut is the shift from private sector deficit spending to private sector savings, as in the debt-deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher and the Financial Instability Hypothesis of Hyman Minsky, and locate the paradox of thrift in paying down debt. The shift from spending more than one earns to spending less than one earns (in the aggregate) causes a sustained drop in effective demand, and hence a general glut.
Austrian.
Austrian economics see general gluts as caused by misallocation of resources in the years leading up to the crisis, and the ensuing depression as necessary cleansing or purging of the excesses as the economy adjusts.

Portable Surgical Hospital

Portable Surgical Hospitals (PSH) were a type of field hospital. The PSH were units of the United States Army Medical Corps designed to be man-portable by the team manning the hospital. They were eventually replaced by MASH units.
History of the Portable Surgical Hospitals.
During the summer and fall of 1942, a team of Medical Corps officers modified the basic War Department Table of Organization and Equipment (T/O&E) for a standard 25-bed station hospital (T/O&E 8-560, 22 July 1942) into a new theater T/O and table of basic allowances (T/BA) (T/O 8-508-S-SWPA, 31 October 1942) for a portable hospital of 25-beds. The new unit was capable of supporting small units in its camp-type version (with 4 female Army nurses and organic vehicles) or battalion and regimental combat teams in its task force version (without the 4 nurses and organic vehicles). Commanded by a Medical Corps captain or major, the new 29-man portable hospital had 4 medical officers (3 general surgeons and a general surgeon/anesthetist) and 25 enlisted men, including 2 surgical and 11 medical technicians. 
What really marked a radical departure was that all of the unit's equipment, medical and surgical supplies, and rations could weigh no more than the 29 men could personally transport. Hastily assembled and trained, the portable hospitals suffered from many shortcomings in personnel and equipment, which would soon become obvious in jungle fighting. Probably the single most critical problem was the severe limitation placed on the total weight to assure the unit’s portability. From the start, this meant that to be portable, the unit had to give up medical and surgical equipment and supplies that would have been most useful in the field.

De La Salle College (Jersey)

De La Salle College in Jersey is an independent Catholic school taking its name from St John Baptist de la Salle (1651–1719), who founded the Brothers' Order in France.
History.
De La Salle College takes its name from St John Baptist de la Salle (1651–1719), who founded the Brothers' Order in the time of Louis XIV. Today the Order has establishments in over 80 countries.
A few Brothers settled in Jersey at the time of the French Revolution and remained in the Island for several years. Then, from 1866 to 1896, a school of up to 300 pupils run by the Brothers' flourished in St Thomas' Parish. The Brothers left the Island in 1896, but were invited to return in 1917 to found another school.
The school, in fact, was established at Berry House next to St Thomas' Church in Saint Helier and was initially known as St Aloysius College. Within a year the main site of the school was moved to a property known as "The Beeches" on Wellington Hill in the parish of St Saviour. It was at this point that the name De La Salle College was first given to the school.
Under the direction of Brother Edward, the first and longest serving Headmaster (33 years), the school grew significantly in numbers. On opening day, 1 October 1917,there were just a dozen pupils. By the start of the following year the number had increased to 57 and reached one hundred by 1921.
For the first time in 1933 the school topped the 200 mark and a school holiday was given to mark the occasion.
The transfer of the school from the French Province in Quimper to the Province of London in 1948 marked a distinct change in the fortunes of the school. By 1949 no fewer than 470 pupils were attending the school. New buildings were planned and erected in the mid-1950s. Many past pupils testify to the tremendous spirit in the school even at times when it lacked buildings and facilities. Without this spirit it is difficult to appreciate how the school could have survived.
Two significant factors have helped ensure that the school has a bright future well into the next century. The first was the introduction of the Covenant Scheme. Begun in the mid-1960s, it led initially to the opening of the swimming pool and gymnasium and then to a period of rapid expansion. The 6th Form Block, Science Building, CDT, Art Rooms and the Computer Room were completed in quick succession. Secondly, in 1976 the States of Jersey agreed to provide the school with generous financial assistance in the form of a capitation grant for running costs.
The 6th Form Block, Science Labs and I.T. facilities, Art Rooms, CDT workshops and Drawing office, a new Infant School, six new classrooms for secondary and a new Junior School were all completed thanks to the help provided through the Covenant Scheme.
A “new age” began in the late 1990s when negotiations began with the States of Jersey for capital funding and the building of 8 new classrooms and a Library and Resources area began in January 2003.
Though there is no longer a Brothers’ Community in Jersey, the school retains close links with the Brothers who are Trustees of the College.
"Lasallian Voices".
"Lasallian Voices" is the termly publication of De la Salle College, Jersey. Students can send in stories, poems and other work to be published in the next edition. The most recent edition was published in the Summer of 2010. However, only the first and second editions have been published online.

The official title of ISO 13399 is Cutting tool data representation and exchange.
ISO 13399 is an International Standard for the computer-interpretable representation and exchange of industrial product data. The objective is to provide a mechanism that is capable of describing product data regarding cutting tools, independent from any particular system. The nature of this description makes it suitable not only for neutral file exchange, but also as a basis for implementing and sharing product databases and archiving, regarding cutting tools.
Typically ISO 13399 can be used to exchange data between CAD, CAM, CAE, PDM/EDM and other CAx systems.
The usage of the ISO 13399 standard will simplify the exchange of data for cutting tools. Expected results are lower cost for managing the information about tools and a more accurate and efficient usage of manufacturing resources. The ISO 13399 has been developed with contributions from AB Sandvik Coromant, the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Kennametal Inc, and Ferroday Ltd.
ISO 13399 is developed and maintained by the ISO technical committee TC 29, Small tools, sub-committee WG34. Like other ISO and IEC standards ISO 13399 is copyright by ISO and is not freely available. Other standards developed and maintained by ISO TC29/WG34 are:

Biography.
Tamura was born in the plebeian Asakusa district of Tokyo, where her father was a rice broker. At the age of seventeen she entered the literature faculty of "Nihon Joshi Daigaku" Japan Women's University. However, the long commute by foot, from her home affected her health and forced her to withdraw after only a single term. She began her writing career as a disciple of Kōda Rohan, but later turned to Okamoto Kido for advice, and briefly flirted with a career as a stage actress. Her novel "Akirame" ("Resignation", 1911) won the Osaka "Asahi Shimbun" literary prize. She followed this with "Miira no kuchibeni" ("Lip Rouge on a Mummy", 1913), and "Onna Sakusha" ("Woman Writer", 1913). She became a best-selling writer, and contributed numerous works to such mainstream literary magazines as "Chūō Kōrōn" and "Shincho".
In 1918, she left her husband Tamura Shogyo to follow her lover, "Asahi Shimbun" journalist Suzuki Etsu, to Vancouver, in Canada, where she lived until 1936. On her return to Japan, she had an affair with leftist Kubokawa Tsurujiro.
In 1942, she moved to Shanghai, China, then under Japanese occupation, where she edited a Chinese literary magazine "Nu-Sheng". She died of a brain hemorrhage in Shanghai in 1945, and her grave is at the temple of Tokei-ji in Kamakura.
After her death, her royalties were used to establish a literary prize for women writers.

Westwood rim

The Westwood rim style of cycle rim used on bicycles was one of the original steel rim designs, developed during or before 1891. Bowden brakes and cables designed for use with this rim were introduced in 1896. Westwood rims have also been found ideal for use with drum brakes. They were last used on the roadster cycles found in Britain up to the 1960s and still common in South and East Asia and Africa and becoming common once again in Europe. Westwood rims have rounded sides, so they are not suitable for use with caliper brakes. Westwood rims features a wide single-wall cross section, the inside circumference of the rim has a contoured section shape to aid with strength. Today Westwood profile rims found in the West are mostly used in drum brake system roadsters and, to a lesser degree, in bicycles with coaster brake systems.
Variations and sizes.
Raleigh Bicycle Company developed a variation that combined the rod braking surfaces of Westwood rims with flat sides for caliper braking. It has been called "Raleigh Pattern" and "Westrick". They are noted for their strength, and there is also a Schwinn Bicycle Company copy of this design.
Westwood profile rims are most commonly seen in sizes 635 mm (28 x 1 ½ in), also marked 700 B,

Parson Nicholson

Thomas Clark "Parson" Nicholson (April 14, 1863 – February 28, 1917) was an American baseball player whose career spanned from 1887 to 1899. He played principally as a second baseman and in the minor leagues. He did play three seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Wolverines in 1888, the Toledo Maumees in 1890, and the Washington Senators in 1895.
Nicholson's only full season in the major leagues came in 1890 with Toledo when he appeared in 134 games, all at second base, and compiled a .268 batting average with 11 triples, four home runs, 72 RBIs and 46 stolen bases. Over the course of 12 minor league seasons, Nicholson appeared in 837 games and compiled a .303 batting average with 48 triples, 37 home runs, and 354 stolen bases.
Early years and nickname.
Nicholson was born in Blaine, Ohio, in 1863. He received the nickname "Parson", because he refused to play baseball on Sundays.
Professional baseball player.
Ohio minor leagues.
Nicholson began his professional baseball career playing for minor league clubs in Columbus, Barnesville, and Wooster, Ohio, and in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. In 1887, at age 24, he compiled a .357 batting average playing in the Ohio State League for teams in Wheeling, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio.
Detroit and Toledo.
In 1888, he played for the St. Louis Whites in the Western Association. He joined the Detroit Wolverines late in the season, making his major league debut on September 14, 1888. He appeared in 24 games as a second baseman for Detroit and compiled a .259 batting average.
The 1888 Detroit team finished in fifth place with a 68-63 record. With high salaries owed to the team's star players, and gate receipts declining markedly, the team folded in October 1888 with the players being sold to other teams. Nicholson was acquired by the Cleveland Spiders, but the Spiders sold Nicholson to the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League in May 1889 for $500. Nicholson appeared in 87 games for Mud Hens in 1889 and moved with the team when they joined the American Association and became the Toledo Maumees in 1890. Nicholson appeared in 134 games, all at second base, for the Maumees in 1890, his lengthiest stint in the majors. He compiled a .268 batting average with 11 triples, four home runs, 72 RBIs and 46 stolen bases.
Return to minors.
In 1891, Nicholson returned to the minor leagues, playing for the Sioux City Huskers in the Western Association.
During the 1892 season, Nicholson played for three different teams -- Joliet/Aurora in the Illinois-Iowa League, Chattanooga in the Southern Association, and Toledo in the Western League.
Nicholson next spent the 1893 and 1894 seasons playing for Erie in the Eastern League. He totaled 141 stolen bases in two seasons with Erie and compiled batting averages of .306 and .333.
Washington.
In 1895, Nicholson returned to the major leagues with the Washington Senators. In 10 games for Washington, he compiled a .184 batting average with a triple, five RBIs and six stolen bases. He appeared in his final major league game on May 6, 1895.
Final years in the minors.
After being released by the Senators, Nicholson signed with the Detroit Tigers, then of the Western League. During the 1895 season, he hit .348 in 81 games for the Tigers and had three triples and nine home runs.
Nicholson continued to play in the minors through the 1899 season. He split the 1897 season playing with three Western League teams and played the 1898 season for Newark in the Atlantic League and Kansas City in the Western League.

Crothers Woods

Crothers Woods is an area of the Don River valley in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is in size and consists of woodland, meadows, wetlands, and an assortment of past and present municipal uses. The wooded area has been designated as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. An ESA designation is useful in highlighting valuable natural areas but this does not affect planning uses. The area is currently zoned as undeveloped parkland. Crothers Woods was named after George W. Crothers who built a manufacturing company called "Crothers Caterpillar". The plant built heavy machinery for the construction and mining industries. The company stayed until 1979 when they relocated to Vaughan, Ontario. Murhal Developments bought the property and eventually sold it to Loblaws which built the store that currently occupies the site just off Millwood Road.
While there are no clear boundaries, Crothers Woods is generally thought to include both sides of the valley that extends from Pottery Road and the Bayview Avenue extension in the south and west to the Millwood Road bridge in the east. Further east, good quality forest exists on the north side of the valley for another 1.2 km to the western edge of E.T. Seton Park.
The land in this part of the valley is owned by the TRCA and managed by the city of Toronto's Parks and Forestry Department.
History.
Prior to European colonisation, this area of the valley was heavily wooded. The area remained relatively untouched until 1787 when this area was bought from the Mississauga natives as part of the Toronto Purchase. After the establishment of York in 1793, land grants were made for much of the land north of the city including the Don Valley. In the 1800s, the Don River was exploited for its capacity to support water driven mills. At least two mills were constructed in this part of the valley. They were eventually purchased by the Taylor family who owned the Don Valley Brick Works.
Due to urban expansion, the city constructed the North Toronto Sewage Treatment Plant in 1929. This handles effluent from local areas including Leaside and North Toronto.
Domtar operated a plant that produced and recycled paper products. Immediately to the north of it, was Bate Chemical and Polyresins Inc. Manufacturer of oil and water based paint resins and adhesives. (It was also subcontracted from Lever Bros to make Ajax Liquid cleaners.) They operated until the late 1980s when they closed. Subsequently the TRCA purchased the land and demolished all of the buildings except for Bate Chemicals research and development lab building. It was converted into the Toronto Police dog training facility. The rest of the area was cleaned up and the contaminated soil removed.
On the north side of the valley, the land where a former brick making operation called Sun Valley Ltd. was used as an industrial landfill. This was used mostly for brick and ash waste from nearby industry. It was shut down in the 1980s. The dump was capped with clean fill and now is marked by a large meadow covered with invasive grasses and plants. It is currently undergoing natural restoration efforts. In particular it has become the Don Valley site for "Trees Across Toronto", a city wide tree planting program.
Forest.
Crothers Woods is known as a beech-maple-oak climax forest. It includes such tree species as American Beech, Sugar Maple, Black Walnut, and Red and White oak. There are also a few Butternut which are currently listed as an endangered species by the Species at Risk Act. In, 1995, the forest was designated as an ESA partly due to the quality of the forest but also to the presence of rare understory plants. These include Greater Straw Sedge, Thin-leaved Sunflower, and Pale-leaved Sunflower. The forest is a good place to view common spring ephemerals such as Trout Lily, Trillium, and Bloodroot.
Animals typical of an urban forest can be seen here. Black-crowned Night Herons have been spotted near the river and at ponds within Crothers Woods. Red-tailed Hawks are also frequent visitors and can be seen hovering over the woods. Recently White-tailed Deer have been spotted in the woods and it appears they are becoming permanent residents.
Mountain biking.
Due to the steep walls and the extensive gullies that exist through this part of the valley, Crothers Woods attracted the attention of many user groups over the years. A trail network which was begun by motorcyclists in the 1960s was subsequently adopted by cyclists in the 1980s with the advent of the mountain bike. Cycling usage grew steadily over the next decade, corresponding with the North American popularity of the sport, and the trails were also enjoyed by trail runners, dog-walkers, bird-watchers, and hikers. By the early 1990s, some of the trails had become degraded through overuse. At that time, initial efforts were made by the Parks Department to control the environmental damage by blocking off badly eroded trails. However, this activity was postponed after the Metro amalgamation in 1998.
In 2004, the city again became involved at the behest of local groups such as the Task Force to Bring Back the Don. Rather than try to limit use, the city adopted a proactive approach and decided to work with all stakeholders and user groups to repair and improve the trail system. For the short term, they brought in consultants from the International Mountain Bicycling Association and put on trail building workshops. These workshops have taught skills necessary to create shared sustainable trails and have resulted in a marked improvement in the quality of the trail system. While the cycling community has supported this program with volunteer labour, some environmentalists have been less than sanguine about the continued cycling activity in Crother's Woods.
For the longer term, the city commissioned a management plan in 2006 on Crothers Woods to come up with guidelines on how to best manage the trails and alleviate the longstanding friction between the various stakeholders and user groups.
As the single largest user group of the trails in Crothers Woods, cyclists have recently organized in order to better deal with the city staff and other smaller stakeholder groups. In 2004, a group called the "Don Valley Trails Users Club" was formed by cyclists, and was intended to serve as an umbrella organization representing all trail users. In 2007, the DVTUC was superseded by a new organization called the "Toronto Off Road Bicycling Group", with a stronger mandate to represent cyclists.

Monkeytown, West Virginia

Monkeytown is a small hamlet in Pendleton County, West Virginia, near the city of Riverton. It is located on U.S. Route 33 on the western face of North Fork Mountain.
This town was never incorporated as a town, but has existed as an area relevant to local people. The area was inhabited by Native American tribes long before being settled by European immigrants. Those who now live in the area are a mixture of German, Swiss, Irish, Scottish, and English descent. The population is now less than fifty persons.
History.
The town got its name from a local man, Don L. Burns, when he observed that the town was full of children running and playing in the surrounding forests. Listening to them hoop and holler, he made the statement, "This ain't but a damn monkey town". And the name stuck - still appearing on electric and phone bills as late as the 1980s.
Present day.
At one point in the mid 20th century, the town boasted a bus stop, a country store, a post office. Today all of these innovations have disappeared, with most of the civic works occurring in nearby Riverton.

Frank Scheibeck

Frank S. Scheibeck (June 28, 1865 – October 22, 1956) was an American shortstop in professional baseball from 1887 to 1906. He played eight seasons of Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Blues (1887, 1901), Detroit Wolverines (1888), Toledo Maumees (1890), Pittsburgh Pirates (1894), Washington Senators (1894–95, 1899), and Detroit Tigers (1906).
Baseball player.
Scheibeck was born in Detroit in 1865. He played professional baseball in Detroit in three decades and three leagues, for the Detroit Wolverines of the National League in 1888, for the of the Western League from 1895 to 1896, and for the Detroit Tigers of the American League in 1906. When he signed with the Tigers in April 1895, the "Detroit Free Press" wrote: "Scheibeck is not only a daring and good fielder, but he is fast on the lines and can do his share of hitting."
Scheibeck began his professional baseball career in 1887 playing shortstop for the Duluth Freezers in the Northwestern League. He compiled a .335 batting average and stole 47 bases in 94 games at Duluth. He played the next two seasons for the London Tecumsehs in the International League. In 1888, he had a .305 batting average and 81 stolen bases in 92 games for London.
While Scheibeck appeared in three games for the Cleveland Blues in 1887 and one game for the Detroit Wolverines in 1888, his first extended playing time in Major League Baseball was in 1890 with the Toledo Maumees of the American Association. That year, he led the league with 134 games played at shortstop, 282 putouts at shortstop, and 412 assists at shortstop, but also led the league with 92 errors. He also compiled a .350 on-base percentage, drew 76 bases on balls, and stole 57 bases for Toledo in 1890.
After a full season in a major league in 1890, Schebeck spent the next three seasons in the minor leagues, playing for the Sioux City Corn Huskers (1891), Atlanta Firecrackers (1892), Omaha Omahogs (1892), Erie Blackbirds (1893), and Los Angeles Angels (1893).
Scheibeck returned to the major leagues in 1894 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He compiled a .353 batting average and .421 on-base percentage in 116 plate appearances for the Pirates. In 1895, his batting average plummeted to .180 while playing for the Washington Senators.
Between 1897 and 1900, Schebeck played in the Eastern League for the Syracuse Stars (1897) and Montreal Royals (1898–1900).
In 1901, Sheibeck again returned to the major leagues as the starting shortstop for the Cleveland Blues. He appeared in 93 games for the Blues as the seventh oldest player in the American League.
Scheibeck began the 1903 season playing for the Rochester Bronchos in the Eastern League. In June 1903, Scheibeck quit the Rochester club and signed with the Denver Grizzlies in the Western League.
Later years.
At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, Scheibeck was living in Detroit with his wife, Jospehine, and their daughter, Josephine. Scheibeck was employed at the time as a real estate salesman.
At the time of the 1930 and 1940 U.S. Censuses, he was living in Detroit with his second wife Theodoshia (Phillips) Scheibeck. He was employed as a real estate salesman in 1930 and as a busher in an auto buckling department in 1940.

Anne d'Alençon

Anne d'Alençon (Italian: Anna d'Alençon) (30 October 1492 – 18 October 1562), Lady of La Guerche, was a French noblewoman and a Marquise of Montferrat as the wife of William IX, Marquis of Montferrat. She acted as Regent of the Marquisate of Montferrat for her son, Boniface from 1518 to his death in 1530.
Life.
Anne was the third child of René, Duke of Alençon and his second wife Margaret of Lorraine, daughter of Frederick, Count of Vaudémont and Yolande of Anjou. Her father died two days after her birth. 
She was betrothed to William IX, Marquis of Montferrat of the Palaiologos family in 1501 and married him on 31 October 1508, the day after her sixteenth birthday, in the church of St. Sauveur in Blois. She bore her husband three children: Maria (1509–1530), Margherita, (1510–1566), and Boniface (1512–1530), William's heir who became Boniface IV of Montferrat.
In 1517, her eldest daughter, Maria, was betrothed to Federico II Gonzaga, son of Isabella d'Este, who later became Marquis and Duke of Mantua. The marriage contract was annulled, however, after Federico accused Maria of attempting to poison his mistress Isabella Boschetti, wife of the Count of Calvisano.
On the death of William in 1518, the infant Boniface inherited the Marquisate. Anne, however, acted as regent until his unexpected death in June 1530 and she remained involved in the government of Montferrat when Boniface was succeeded as Marquis by her brother-in-law John George, previously commendatory abbot of Lucedio and (unconsecrated) Bishop of Casale.
Boniface's death also rekindled Federico II Gonzaga's interest in marrying Maria. On the latter's unexpected death in September 1530 his attentions turned to the second daughter, Margherita. Having weighed up the various proposals for Margherita's hand, Anne opted for the link with the House of Gonzaga and the marriage was concluded in October of 1531.
In 1533 the Marquis John George died, leaving one natural son, but no heir. A dispute over the succession to the Marquisate, an imperial fiefdom, ensued, the contenders being the Gonzaga, the Marquis of Saluzzo and the House of Savoy, all of whom were able to make plausible claims. Meanwhile the Montferrat was effectively under Spanish domination. In 1536 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor assigned the fiefdom to Margherita Paleologa and her husband, Federico II, Duke of Mantua. Anne, however, returned as "de facto" ruler. In 1540 Federico II died at Marmirolo and was succeeded by his seven year old son Francesco as Marquis of Montferrat and Duke of Mantua. Margherita Paleologo Gonzaga became regent, together with her brother-in-law Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga.
On retiring from public life Anne d'Alençon entered the convent of Dominican Sisters of Catherine of Siena which adjoined her palazzo in Casale Monferrato. She died on 18 October 1562, shortly before her seventieth birthday.
The Alençon inheritance.
In 1525, following the Battle of Pavia, Anne's brother Charles IV, Duke of Alençon died leaving his personal property to Anne and to her sister Françoise d'Alençon. (This inheritance was disputed unsuccessfully by Charles's widow, Marguerite d'Angoulême, sister of Francis I, King of France.) Anne in turn assigned these assets to Isabella Gonzaga, the eldest daughter of Federico and Margherita. Isabella having renounced the inheritance, Margherita succeeded in having them transferred to her third son Ludovico, later Duke of Nevers and founder of the Gonzaga Nevers branch of the House of Gonzaga.

Marianne Pistohlkors

Marianne Pistohlkors, born Marianna Erikovna von Pistohlkors, (June 30, 1890 - May 14, 1976), was a suspected co-conspirator in the murder of Grigori Rasputin. The first wife of Count Nicholas von Zarnekau, she was known for many years as Countess Marianne von Zarnekau, became one of the first women of nobility to attend the Imperial School of Dramatic Arts, and appeared under the stage name Mariana Fiory in MGM's 1944 film "Song of Russia."
Early life.
Born at St. Petersburg, Russia, Marianne von Pistohlkors was the daughter of Olga Valerianovna Karnovich and Maj.-Gen. Erik Augustinovich von Pistohlkors. Her father was an adjutant to Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, the Tsar's uncle.
As a child, Marianne had an older brother, Alexander Erikovich Pistohlkors, and an older sister, Olga Erikovna Pistohlkors. When she was still a young girl, her mother divorced her father and began an affair with the widowed Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, causing a scandal in society.
The affair resulted in the birth of a son out of wedlock, Vladimir Pavlovich von Pistohlkors, who later became a famous poet.
Olga Valerianovna von Pistohlkors finally married the Grand Duke Paul on 10 October 1902 at Livorno, Italy. Because the couple had deliberately disrespected the authority of Tsar Nicholas II by wedding without his permission, they were banished. They moved to France.
In 1904, Grand Duke Paul arranged through Prince Regent Leopold of Bavaria for his wife and her children to be granted titles of nobility. They were styled Counts and Countesses of Hohenfelsen and granted a coat of arms.
Only after much pleading by relatives did the Tsar finally relent in 1905 and allow them to return to St. Petersburg. Olga was then granted the Russian title Princess Paley, and her son, Vladimir, became Prince Paley. It should be noted that unlike morganatic wives of other Romanov Grand Dukes, Olga never bore the title "Princess Romanowsky," a name that would have associated her visibly with the Imperial Family. As was customary with morganatic Romanov marriages, moreover, neither Olga nor her children was ever considered a member of the Imperial House before the Revolution of 1917.
Marianne von Pistohlkors thus became, at age 15, a countess, and later the daughter of a princess. Upon the Grand Duke's return from France to St. Petersburg in 1905, Marianne also gained two siblings, children of her stepfather's first marriage, whom she had not previously known: a step-sister, the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, and a step-brother, the Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich of Russia.
Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna became a Princess of Sweden and wrote a series of well-received memoirs. Grand Duke Dmitri was an excellent horseman who participated in the 1912 Stockholm Olympics and later, along with Marianne, became a suspect in Rasputin's murder.
While Marianne attended school, her mother gave birth to two more daughters: Irina Pavlovna Romanovskaya-Paleya (1903 - 1990) and Natalia Hohenfelsen, Countess Hohenfelsen (1905 - 1981). Both girls went on to become fashion models in the 1920s, and Natalia Paley later became a Hollywood movie star.
Between 1905 and the time of Rasputin's murder in 1916, Princess Olga Paley worked hard to make the court of the Grand Duke Paul a popular rival to that of the Tsar. The family entertained many important figures in St. Petersburg society, and the house thus became a center of court intrigue.
According to Gen. Alexander Spiridovich, chief of the Tsar's Secret Personal Police, it was this rivalry between the competing salons of St. Petersburg that eventually resulted in the monk Gregory Rasputin being introduced to the Imperial Family. Rasputin arrived at St. Petersburg in 1907, won admirers, and was adopted in 1908 by Anna Vyrubova, a close friend of the Tsarina.
Marriages.
Marianne's older brother, Alexander Erikovich Pistohlkors, married to Alexandra Taneyeva, the sister of the Tsarina's lady in waiting Anna Vyrubova. Alexander and his wife were thus drawn into Rasputin's circle of supporters, and their conversation at family gatherings strongly affected the opinions of the Princess Paley and the Grand Duke Paul.
According to Burke's Peerage, Marianne herself married three times: firstly in 1908 to Lt. Col. Peter Petrovich Durnovo, the son of the Tsar's chief of secret police, P.N. Durnovo, and a classmate of Marianne's older brother Alexander; secondly in 1912 to Christopher von Derfelden, another of Alexander's classmates in the Horse Guard; and thirdly, on 30 October 1917, to Count Nicholas Constantinovich von Zarnekau, a cornette in the Horse Guard and the son of Duke Constantine Petrovich of Oldenburg.
Murder of Rasputin.
During World War I, when things began going badly on the Russian Front, the newspapers accused Rasputin of exercising a dark and malevolent influence over the Tsar and Tsarina. Considering it their duty to defend the empire and the honor of the royal family, some of the wealthiest families in St. Petersburg began to plot against him.
Marianne von Pistohlkors was allegedly one of two women and several men present in the palace belonging to Felix Yussupov on the night that Rasputin was lured there in December 1916. "Malanya's also taking part," Yussupov wrote to his wife Princess Irina of Russia in the weeks before the murder. Pistohlkors' nickname was Malanya.
She, like Grand Duke Dimitri, was later arrested by the Tsar's secret police following the murder. However, the Tsar later ordered her release. Sympathies were on Pistohlkors' side, according to her mother's memoirs, "Memories of Russia 1916-1919." "When we arrived at 8 Theatre Square, where Marianne lived, we were stopped by two soldiers who let us through only after taking down our names. All the highest society was at Marianne's! Some ladies she barely knew arrived in order to express sympathy with her. Officers came up to kiss her hand."
None of the male co-conspirators ever publicly denounced Pistohlkors or the other woman suspected of involvement, ballerina and film star Vera Karalli. Neither were these women prosecuted in the subsequent legal trials.
According to one author, the Tsar kept their names out of the case because he did not want more public displays of sympathy for the murderers of Rasputin. He also knew that his sickly uncle Grand Duke Paul was very upset by Dimitri's involvement in the murder and was taking badly the Tsar's decision to exile Dmitri to the Persian front. The Tsar presumably did not want to add to the grand duke's suffering by also charging his stepdaughter.
Exile.
In March 1918, Marianne's half-brother, the poet Prince Vladimir Paley, was arrested by the Bolsheviks and sent to the Urals. He was executed there on 18 July 1918, his body dumped in a mine shaft near Alapayevsk.
At about this time, Marianne and her new husband, Count Nicholas von Zarnekau, made an effort to help the remaining family of the Grand Duke Paul to escape.
According to the memoirs of Marianne's stepsister, the Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, "Once in the beginning of July , late at night, when we had been long asleep, there was a knock at my door. Waking, I saw upon the threshold of my bedroom Marianne Zarnikau, one of my stepmother's daughters by her first marriage. She explained that we must immediately dress and go to Petrograd. She had come from there in an automobile to fetch us. According to information which had come to her the uprising of the Bolsheviks was set for the next day . . . "
It proved a false alarm. The family returned to their homes in St. Petersburg, a decision that was a fatal error. The Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich was arrested in August 1918, sent to the St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress, and despite constant pleas for his release by Princess Paley, he was shot on 29 January 1919 and buried in a mass grave. His remains were not discovered until 2011.
The Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her second husband, Prince Roman Putiatin, chose to stay in St. Petersburg, finally escaping to Romania in 1919. Princess Olga Paley escaped via Finland in 1920, and died in Paris on 2 December 1929, age 64.
Marianne and Nicholas von Zarnekau managed to escape Russia some time after 1923 with the help of her first husband, Peter Dournovo, who arranged for their passage to Finland. They settled in Belgium, and Marianne is mentioned in Anthony Summer's book "The File on the Tsar":
"Countess de Zarnekau, an ex-patriate living in Brussels, told how in about 1923 a nun arrived at their home in Moscow and announced mysteriously that the Tsar and all the family were alive 'somewhere close to the border'. She asked for, and was given, wooly socks to warm the imperial feet. Those who had been able to deal with the little matter of the Tsar's rescue were now apparently having trouble in getting him the right size in socks."
Acting career.
In 1930, Marianne divorced Count von Zarnekau, her third husband, and launched her acting career in Europe under the stage name "Mariana Fiory". In February 1930, she appeared at the Theatre Mathurins in Paris, starring in the role of a German soldier's grieving fiancee in "The Man I Killed," a dramatization of the war novel "L'Homme que j'ai tue". Playwright Maurice Rostrand reportedly wrote the play specifically for Marianne. The show was a hit and won glowing reviews. Marianne went on to Rome, to star opposite Emma Gramatica, a popular Italian film actress of the 1930s.
Mariana Fiory, the former Countess von Zarnekau, arrived in the United States in 1936. She first appeared on the New York stage in February 1937 as the lead in Michel Dulud's play "Dans le Noir" at the Barbizon-Plaza theatre. Mariana then appeared in "The Shining Hour" with a stock company in New Hampshire, and apparently decided to settle in the U.S.
Through a friendship with Wally Castlebarco, the daughter of composer Arturo Toscanini, the ex-Countess was signed to appear on NBC. The Schenectady NY Gazette for 7 January 1938 reported "One of Europe's noted actresses, Mariana Fiory, once a member of the Russian royal family, is to make her first appearance in American radio when she plays in the Radio Guild on WJZ-NBC at 2. The production is Ibsen's "Rosmersholm' '."
In late 1938 Marianne played "Tessie Konstantin" in the Broadway production of the satire "Waltz in Goose Step" at the Hudson Theatre.
The Brooklyn NY Daily Eagle spotlighted her with a brief interview on 5 November 1938. "The Countess Mariana Zarnekau, daughter of Grand Duke Paul and cousin of the late Russian Czar, scorns titles, knows nothing about dictators, and has no quarrels with Stalinists, but 'adores' the stage and the Brooklyn waterfront."
Marianne told the reporter she was "very, very ready" to discourse at length on the worthlessness of royal connections. "What did the revolution do for me? Why it set me free, and gave me the chance to fulfill a lifelong ambition to enter the old Imperial Dramatic School and study for the stage."
In October 1939, Hollywood columnist May Mann caught up with Mariana Fiory at a smart Russian perfume bar on Fifth Avenue and heard a similar story. "I was too young. I did not know what the revolution was all about. We left our palaces and lived crowded in rooms. We were glad to have our lives. . . . I married Count Zarnekau, and we were terribly poor. All of our properties had been seized and we had nothing. I helped to found the first dramatic school in Communistic Russia. Then I went to Paris and starred many seasons on the stage. . . . This spring I starred in 'Window Panes.' I do not long for the old Russia. America is so much more interesting."
During World War II Marianne moved to California, where she appeared with Robert Taylor and several Russian actors in the MGM movie "Song of Russia" (1944), the story of an American symphonic conductor, trapped in Russia during World War II, who helps with the resistance. Marianne plays "Nina." Produced by Joseph Pasternak and directed by Gregory Ratoff, "Song of Russia" premiered in February 1944.

Eltjo Haselhoff

Eltjo Haselhoff (1962) is best known as a Dutch 'fingerstyle' guitarist and composer, although he has delved into numerous other endeavours, including arts (cartoons, caricatures, oil paintings, photography), science (physics, biophysics and magnetic resonance), musical instrument building and engineering. He has played guitar since he was 8 years old, but has never had one single guitar lesson. He does not read or write music. He also plays several other musical instruments, besides the guitar.
Fingerstyle Guitar.
After more than 30 years of playing and composing, Haselhoff released his debut CD "Fingerstyle Guitar Solos" in the year 2005, with the small label Peghead Productions. Fingerstyle is an advanced guitar technique, with the guitarist playing the melody, chords and bass lines all at the same time. The CD was well received, particularly in the USA, where Haselhoff is sometimes compared to guitarist Chet Atkins. Soon, the American label Solid Air Records picked Haselhoff's music for release in the USA. Since then, Haselhoff also appeared on various cover albums, including "Cole Porter: DeLovely Guitar", "Poppin' Guitars: A Tuneful of Sherman" and "A Guitar for Elvis". Haselhoff's second solo album, "Guitar Magic", was released in November 2007. Besides audio CDs, Haselhoff also produced fingerstyle guitar instructional DVDs in English, Dutch and German. This is the only instructional DVD ever made with the same artist speaking three different languages (an Italian version is forthcoming). Eltjo Haselhoff is currently living in the USA.

Nicole Hollander

__NOTOC__
Nicole Hollander (born April 25, 1939) is an American cartoonist and writer. Her daily comic strip "Sylvia" was syndicated to newspapers nationally by Tribune Media Services and also can be seen on her blog, BadGirl Chats. 
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Hollander was the daughter of Shirley Mazur Garrison and Henry Garrison, a labor activist and member of the carpenters union. Growing up in a working-class Chicago neighborhood, she was educated in Chicago public schools. She earned a B.F.A. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1960 and an M.F.A. from Boston University in 1966. Her marriage to Hungarian sociologist Paul Hollander ended in a 1962 divorce.
During the 1970s, she was the graphic designer of a feminist publication, "The Spokeswoman", where she had the opportunity to transform the newsletter into a monthly magazine. While designing pages, she occasionally added her own political illustrations. "Around 1978," she created a comic strip, "The Feminist Funnies", later introducing the character who became Sylvia. Selections from "The Feminist Funnies" appeared as a calendar, "Witches, Pigs and Fairy Godmothers: The 1978 Feminist Funnies Appointment Calendar", and in her 1979 book, "I'm in Training to Be Tall and Blonde". The book's success led Field Enterprises to distribute "Sylvia" to newspapers as a daily comic strip starting in 1981. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hollander drew comics for "Mother Jones" magazine. Many of these did not include the Sylvia character. 
Hollander has donated the archive of her work to the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University. A number of her drawings are in the collection of the Library of Congress. She is a faculty member at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, in 2011 offering a course in writing the graphic novel. She has led workshops and taught at Ohio State University, Columbia College Chicago, the Ox-Bow School of Art, Chicago's Printers Row Lit Fest, and for the Chicago Arts Partnership in Education. Her frequent appearances as a public speaker since 2001 have occurred at The New School, Loyola University Chicago, DePaul University, the Art Institute of Chicago, Enoch Pratt Free Library, the Library of Congress, Stagebridge, and elsewhere. In 2009, Hollander curated a show of women's humor, "And You Think This Is Funny?", for Chicago's Woman Made Gallery; the show included the work of some 50 women artists. The gallery's simultaneous ten-year retrospective exhibit of Hollander's work was titled "It's Enough to Make a Cat Laugh." In 2012, Nicole Hollander's "unique collection of condom packages and sex toys" entered the collection of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction.
In 2005, Hollander appeared in a one-woman show, "Return to Lust", at Pegasus Players in Chicago. A second show, "Plastic Surgery or a Real Good Haircut", opened in 2008 at Chicago's Live Bait Theatre. In these performances, she described her experiences as an aging woman dealing with physical vanity, sexual desire and an overlong birthday-party guest list.
Retirement.
On March 26. 2012, Hollander announced that she was retiring her "Sylvia" strip from newspaper syndication. She plans to continue posting archival strips on her blog--"many of them, unfortunately, are as relevant now as they were then"—with occasional new strips.
Books.
Hollander has published 19 "Sylvia" collections, including "The Whole Enchilada" (1982), "Tales from the Planet Sylvia" (1990), with an introduction by Barbara Ehrenreich, and "The Sylvia Chronicles: 30 Years of Graphic Misbehavior from Reagan to Obama" (2010), with an introduction by Jules Feiffer. She is the author of "Tales of Graceful Aging from the Planet Denial" (2007) and the illustrator of many books by other writers, including children's books by Robie Harris and books in praise of cats by Allia Zobel.
With Skip Morrow and Ron Wolin, Hollander edited "Drawn Together: Relationships Lampooned, Harpooned, & Cartooned" (Crown, 1983) for the Cartoonists Guild. Her work was included in the satirical pro-choice comic book "Choices" (Angry Isis Press, 1990) alongside such fellow contributors as Howard Cruse, Jules Feiffer, Bill Griffith, Cathy Guisewite, Bill Koeb, Lee Marrs, Nina Paley and Garry Trudeau. Gina Barreca and Nicole Hollander collaborated on "An ABC of Vice: An Insatiable Woman's Guide" (Bibliopola Press, 2003), which combines Barreca's text and Hollander's cartoons. Hollander's cartoons are featured on the covers and in the text of "Getting in Touch with Your Inner Bitch" (Hysteria, 1994) and "The Inner Bitch: Guide to Men, Relationships, Dating, Etc." (Hysteria, 1999), by Elizabeth Hilts.
Awards.
Hollander's work has formed the basis for several theatrical musicals, including "Female Problems" and "Sylvia's Real Good Advice", winner of a Joseph Jefferson Award in 1991. Other awards include the Wonder Woman Foundation Award for Women of Achievement over 40 (1983) and Yale's Chubb Fellowship for Public Service (1985).
Projects.
In 2012, Hollander began work on a memoir in visual form. She told an interviewer of other plans: "I always hope I'll have a show," says Hollander. "Now that I have time to think of these things, I'm thinking of approaching galleries with this work my house is full of."

Igneous textures

Igneous textures include the rock textures occurring in igneous rocks. Igneous textures are used by geologists in determining the mode of origin igneous rocks and are used in rock classification. There are six main types of textures; phaneritic, aphanitic, porphyritic, glassy, pyroclastic and pegmatitic. 
"Aphanitic" ("a" = not, "phaner" = visible) rocks in contrast to phaneritic rocks, typically form from lava which crystallize rapidly on or near the Earth' surface. Because extrusive rocks make contact with the atmosphere they cool quickly, so the minerals do not have time to form large crystals. The individual crystals in an aphanitic igneous rock are not distinguisable to the naked eye. Examples of aphanitic igneous rock include basalt, andesite and rhyolite.
"Glassy" or "vitreous" textures occur during some volcanic eruptions when the lava is quenched so rapidly that crystallization cannot occur. The result is a natural amorphous glass with few or no crystals. Examples include obsidian and pumice.
"Pegmatitic" texture occurs during magma cooling when some minerals may grow so large that they become massive (the size ranges from a few centimetres to several metres). This is typical of pegmatites.
"Phaneritic" ("phaner" = visible) textures are typical of intrusive igneous rocks, these rocks crystallized slowly below the Earth's surface. As magma cools slowly the minerals have time to grow and form large crystals. The minerals in a phaneritic igneous rock are sufficiently large to see each individual crystal with the naked eye. Examples of phaneritic igneous rocks are gabbro, diorite and granite.
"Porphyritic" textures develop when conditions during cooling of a magma change relatively quickly. The earlier formed minerals will have formed slowly and remain as large crystals, whereas, sudden cooling causes the rapid crystallization of the remainder of the melt into a fine grained (aphanitic) matrix. The result is an aphanitic rock with some larger crystals (phenocrysts) imbedded within its matrix. Porphyritic texture also occurs when magma crystallizes below a volcano but is erupted before completing crystallization thus forcing the remaining lava to crystallize more rapidly with much smaller crystals.
"Pyroclastic" ("pyro" = igneous, "clastic" = fragment) textures occur when explosive eruptions blast the lava into the air resulting in fragmental, typically glassy material which fall as volcanic ash, lapilli and volcanic bombs.

Madame Walker Theatre Center

The historic Madame C.J. Walker Building, which houses the Madame Walker Theatre Center, has long symbolized the spirit of creativity and community pride in the City of Indianapolis. Named after America’s first self-made female millionaire, Madam C.J. Walker, the site represents the achievements, art forms, culture and history of African American people. As Madame C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991.
History.
Walker began the development of the Walker Building and Theatre prior to her death in 1919. The project was subsequently completed by her daughter A'Lelia Walker and opened to the public in December 1927.
The Walker Building, located in the heart of the Indiana Avenue Cultural District, was the center of entertainment, business and pride for the City’s African American community from the 1920s to the 1950s. During the mid-50s, the building and its surrounding neighborhood began a gradual decline.
By the late 1970s, the Walker Building stood nearly abandoned (Walker Manufacturing Company remained housed in the building) and faced certain demolition. However, a group of committed African American citizens recognized the structure’s rich history and dedicated themselves to preserving the building. After becoming incorporated as the Madame Walker Building Urban Life Center in 1979, the group purchased the ailing building from the Walker Manufacturing Company and began planning for its restoration.
In 1982, the organization’s articles of incorporation were amended to reflect the organization’s new name of Madame Walker Urban Life Center. The not-for-profit organization was committed to reestablishing the facility as a steward for cultural expression and economic enterprise. Because the site was seen as the heart of a downtown neighborhood that had to be revitalized, the community worked hard to make that dream a reality.
In 1983, the first phase of the restoration, which housed offices and the Grand Casino Ballroom, was completed. A $2.5 million capital campaign raised funds to restore the famous 944-seat (now 935) Walker Theatre. The influence of African art forms in the vision of Madam Walker and her daughter for the design concept is apparent throughout the theatre. In 1988, the City of Indianapolis celebrated the gala opening of the fully restored Madame C.J. Walker Building. The site is now a National Historic Landmark, and it is registered on both the State and National Registers of Historic Places.
In 1996, the Madame Walker Urban Life Center became the Madame Walker Theatre Center to more fully reflect the organization’s vision and mission. Two office structures along Indiana Avenue—Walker Plaza, built in 1989 and 500 Place, completed in 1992—as two partners essential to the continued growth of the Madame Walker Theatre Center. As a result of these two ventures, the Walker Building once again stands as an economic anchor for the historic Indiana Avenue Cultural District.
Through the vibrancy of dramatic dance, the smooth, cool sounds of jazz and the evocative spirit of the theatre, the Walker Building builds bridges between artists and patrons.
Performing arts.
The Madame Walker Theatre Center’s annual performing arts season opens in early October and continues until early May. Each season’s programs showcase the talents of local, regional, national and international artists; enlighten the community to a variety of art forms and entertain audiences in a way that encourages ongoing support of the arts.
Jazz on the Avenue. JOA includes the series presented once a month, Jazz Artists in Concert on the Main Stage or in a cabaret setting and the Indiana Avenue Renaissance Festival. These programs present local and national artists and provide opportunities for the community to be educated regarding jazz as an indigenous American art form.
Steppin' on the Avenue. SOA, presented the first Friday of the month, explores not only the meaning of paired dancing in African American life, but the way in which music, song and dance are interrelated in that culture. The program celebrates an art form similar to the Latino Salsa that has emanated the black community as pervasive, vital and distinctive as a form of creative expression.
Laughin' on the Avenue. LOA, presented the last Tuesday of the month, celebrates the art of laughter. The program showcases local and national artists.
Main Stage Series. These programs are primarily presented in the Madame Walker Theatre and include theatre, music and dance. In some cases, international artists presented under the category of Cultural Connections, usually showcased through workshops and classes, are also presented as part of the Main Stage season.
Artists presented as part of our performing arts programs are, in many cases, in residence at the theatre for two or more days, which allows them to develop and participate in community residency, education and humanities programming. These activities deepen the audience’s understanding of the creative process, broaden their knowledge of the country from which the work originates and allow for relationships with the artists to grow. Community involvement and participation are part of our ongoing efforts to develop audiences.
Educational programs.
The educational programs of the Madame Walker Theatre Center are intended to foster in young people a cross-cultural appreciation for the arts.
Youth-in-Arts
In 1987, the Madame Walker Theatre Center launched the Youth-in-Arts program, opening a world of possibilities to Indiana’s children. The program annually targets more than 150 youth who may or may not have the resources to experience the arts outside of their typical school setting. Youth-in-Arts reflects the Center’s mission as it seeks to “provide an environment of cross-cultural appreciation through nurturing and celebrating the artistic and cultural perspectives of African-Americans.
In 2007, the program was redesigned and now consists of three subprograms: 1) Project MAPPED; 2) CRUSHING the CONVENTIONAL, and 3) BEYOND THE WINGS. These fresh new offerings approach the arts through performance and scholarship with the goal of making them an inclusive, lifelong experience. Each new program targets students, teachers and parents.
The Youth-in-Arts mission is to “encourage, expose, explore, and expand the talents of young ‘arts-minded’ individuals by combining African-American cultural phenomena with an integrated arts environment that will ensure every participant the opportunity to experience various roles within the realm of artistic production, while also cultivating civic minded, highly motivated, respectful individuals.”
Project MAPPED
"M.A.P.P.E.D." is an acronym, which stands for Music, Art, Poetry, Performance, Expression, and Dance. The new program is a 12-week interdisciplinary arts curriculum offered 3 days a week in 2-hour intervals targeting grades 3 through 12 and serving students on all performance levels.
The program offers:
• chorus & individual voice lessons,
• string orchestra & individual string lessons,
• poetry & spoken word writing
• speech lessons
• set production & visual arts, and
• various genres of dance (i.e., modern, ballet, jazz, tap, hip hop).
Each session culminates with a semiprofessional performance on stage at the Madame Walker Theatre. The sessions are assigned themes dictated by specific historical events or phenomena within American and African-American culture. In addition to the daily rigors of the program, students enjoy workshops, lecture-demonstrations, and concerts that further introduce them to business practices in the music industry and expose them to the creative processes and aesthetics of various genres.
Crushing the Conventional
This is a concert/lecture/master class series for students, educators and parents showcasing traditional and nontraditional art forms within the African and African-American Diaspora. Admission to these matinee performances is set at an affordable rate ($5 to $7 per performance). The series occurs during the school day and includes master classes and lectures for parents. The matinée series is scheduled to launch in February 2008.
Beyond the Wings
This is a new Arts Administration introductory training initiative of the Center targeting high school students. The program exposes students to basic arts administrative duties and allows them enjoy the benefits of learning about the growing, popular field of arts administration, while collecting valuable community service credits many are required to obtain on a semester basis.
Arts in Education This program provides comprehensive arts experiences to Indianapolis Public School students and students in private, suburban and outlying school districts. The program utilizes artists in residence who are participating in our humanities or performing arts programs to provide workshops, master classes, lecture-demonstrations and mini-concerts that educate the student to the process, technique and aesthetics of various art forms. The Arts in Education program also includes the Children’s Performing Arts Series, which affords opportunities for students to attend matinée performances at the Madame Walker Theatre.
Madame Walker Academy for Girls This program provides comprehensive intermediate-level refinement skills to an underserved segment of the Indianapolis community. Through an ongoing series of workshops, lectures and activities, participants graduate from the academy armed with the ability to present themselves with poise and charm in a variety of settings. The program is open to girls ages 11–17.
Humanities Because the arts and humanities play important roles in shaping and enriching people’s lives, the Madame Walker Theatre Center’s programming for the humanities is designed to encourage participation by persons of all ages.
Writer’s Symposium Series This is an ongoing program of the Center and is designed to familiarize participants with the written word and its place in American culture. The program presents a series of dialogues based in and around the works of local, regional and national authors.
Walker Film Series The series of films is designed to bring visibility to national and international film and video with special emphasis on African and African-American and other ethnic filmmakers.
Tours & Living History Madame Walker Heritage Center. The Heritage Center serves as a display space and repository for information regarding Madam C.J. Walker’s life and legacy as well as the lives of African-Americans who have contributed to American culture. This street-level space offers tours, lectures and small heritage programs presented by local living history theatre Freetown Village. Each year, we anticipate serving more than 5,000 visitors in the Heritage Center.
Today and In The Future The Center continues to develop strong associations nationally, as well as in the local arts and cultural community. The Center provides facilities for Freetown Village and Iibada Dance Company. It serves as a rental facility for other arts, social, civic and business organizations to host their programs and activities.
Through its educational, performing arts and humanities programs, the center strives to better lives through positive cultural experiences.
Madame Walker Theatre.
The Madame Walker Theatre is used for pageants, musicals, concerts, lecturers, auditions and rehearsals, motion picture and video screenings, ceremonial awards presentations and other community events.
Features of the theatre include; Seating capacity of 935, professional lighting and sound, full stage with an Austrian-hung grand drape and fully equipped dressing rooms, lobby, box office services, bar lounge, catering and technical services, and free, secure parking
Additional event venues include the Grand Casino Ball Room, Walker Memorial Board Room and A’Lelia Bundles Conference Center.
The Madame Walker Theatre contains one of the few remaining African-Art Deco architectural motifs in the country. The interior ornamentation includes 150 original colors hand-applied during restoration, an Egyptian statuary, cubist-inspired African masks, spears and brass embellishments highlighted with a regal design, dramatic detail and plush seating.

Good-bye, My Lady

Good-bye, My Lady is a novel by James H. Street about a boy and his dog. It was published by J. B. Lippincott Company in June 1954 and reprinted in paperback by Pocket Books in February 1978. It is based on Street's short story "Weep No More, My Lady", which was published in the 6 December 1941 issue of "The Saturday Evening Post".
Plot summary.
Skeeter is a 14-year-old orphan who lives with his uncle Jesse in a one-room shack in the swamps of the Pascagoula River in Mississippi. He has heard the sound of a strange animal in the swamp near their shack, and one summer evening he convinces his uncle to help him go out and find it. When they do, they see it is a small animal with short red and white fur that makes a chuckling yodel sound and cleans itself like a cat. Jesse is unsure what the animal is, but Skeeter is convinced it is a dog.
The next day, Jesse's friend Alpheus "Cash" Evans, owner of the general store in the nearby village of Lystra, comes to help Skeeter and Jesse track down the animal. With Evans is his tracking dog Gabe and two vicious hog dogs named Bark and Bellow whom he keeps leashed. Evans releases Gabe at the spot where Skeeter and Jesse saw the animal, and Gabe eventually picks up its scent and starts tracking it. As they listen to Gabe tracking the animal it becomes clear that it is outrunning Gabe. It bursts into the clearing, and Evans releases Bark and Bellow. When the animal stands its ground and fights back against the hog dogs, Evans calls them off and allows it to escape. He acknowledges that Skeeter was right - the animal is a dog.
The following day, Skeeter sets out to tame the dog. He is able to locate it, and it proves to be a friendly female who allows him to leash her and bring her with him to the shack. Jesse convinces Skeeter to let her off her leash, and she remains with them. Skeeter decides to name the dog Lady.
Skeeter and Jesse take Lady out with them, and when Lady flushes a covey of quail Skeeter becomes determined to train her as a bird dog. However, Lady's behavior makes it clear that she is someone else's dog, and Skeeter fears that Evans will discover who her real owner is.
Skeeter is horrified when Lady chases and kills a water rat, something no true bird dog will stoop to. He ties the half-eaten rat around her neck, and brings her back to the shack. There, he find Evans visiting with an English Setter he has just purchased. Evans had planned to give his new dog to Jesse and Skeeter to train (for which he intended to pay them three dollars a week), but seeing Lady with her rat causes him to change his mind. When Skeeter apologizes afterwards, Jesse shrugs it off and tells him to concentrate on training Lady.
Within a few months, Skeeter has trained Lady to cast and point like a proper bird dog. A visiting Evans sees Lady pointing at a clump of sage fifty yards away and refuses to believe she has detected birds from so far away. Jesse wagers the cost of a sawblade Evans had given him on credit that Lady is indeed pointing birds. Skeeter is privately dubious, but Jesse wins his bet when a covey of quail break from the sage.
Evans is impressed, and he spreads the word about Skeeter's remarkable dog. In time, Evans hears from a traveling salesman out of Mobile, Alabama that a kennel in Connecticut lost a Basenji near Pascagoula. The description of the lost dog, named Isis of the Blue Nile, matches Lady. A sorrowful Evans tells Jesse, who passes the word on to Skeeter. When Lady responds to the name Isis, Skeeter knows he has the lost Basenji, and decides to return her to her rightful owner. A wire is sent to the kennel, and a man named Walden Grover flies down from Connecticut to take possession of Lady.
Skeeter himself must put Lady in the crate in Grover's pickup truck, then watch as Grover drives off with her. Evans then asks Skeeter to finish training his English Setter, and the boy accepts. With the $100 reward Grover gave him, the boy buys his toothless uncle a set of false teeth, and puts a down payment on a 20 gauge shotgun for himself.
Major themes.
"Good-Bye, My Lady" is a coming of age story. When Skeeter tames Lady, Jesse acknowledges the boy's right to keep her, and defers to Skeeter in all matters concerning Lady. Skeeter's growing maturity is also marked by his uncle's willingness to allow him to drink coffee, which is regarded as an adult beverage. As the novel opens, Skeeter is not permitted to drink coffee. After he tames Lady, his uncle allows him heavily creamed coffee, and after he allows Grover to take Lady away, Jesse tells Evans that Skeeter (whom he now refers to by his given name, Claude) drinks his coffee black.
James Street, a native of Mississippi, was politically liberal, and his fiction often involved an attempt to reconcile his heritage with his liberal views on race. "Good-Bye, My Lady" includes an African-American family, the Watsons, who own a farm across the river from Jesse and Skeeter. The Watsons' eldest son, Gates, is a college graduate. Towards the end of the novel Skeeter learns that Gates Watson knew all along where Lady came from, and also about the reward for her return, but remained silent out of friendship for Skeeter.
Other media.
English Basenji breeder Veronica Tudor-Williams tells of a letter she received from Street in 1942 saying that he first got the idea of writing about a Basenji after seeing a photograph of Veronica Tudor-Williams with some Basenjis in an American magazine. He also wrote that the reader reaction from his first story was so strong that he wrote a sequel, "Please Come Home, My Lady", reuniting Skeeter with Lady. "Please Come Home, My Lady" appeared in the 11 April 1942 issue of "The Saturday Evening Post".
After Street's death, Warner Bros. pictures began production of a film version of the novel, starring Brandon deWilde as Skeeter, Walter Brennan as Uncle Jesse, Phil Harris as Cash Evans, and Sidney Poitier as Gates Watson. The film was produced by John Wayne's Batjac Productions, directed by William A. Wellman, and the screenplay was written by Albert Sidney Fleishman. Veronica Tudor-Williams provided the Basenji, named My Lady of the Congo, who played Lady in the film, and also provided four additional dogs to serve as "doubles" for My Lady. After filming ended, My Lady was adopted by deWilde, and the other dogs were adopted by various members of the film crew. The film version was released on 12 May 1956. It has also appeared under the titles "Goodbye, My Lady" and "The Boy and the Laughing Dog".
"Good-Bye, My Lady" was released by Warner Home Video on VHS on 13 December 1993. The film was released on DVD in December 2010.

Lawrence M. Small

Lawrence M. Small was the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the 11th Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
Background.
Small grew up in suburban New Rochelle, New York. He graduated from New Rochelle High School followed by Brown University in 1963 where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Spanish literature. He held executive positions in Citicorp and Citibank before becoming the President and COO of the FNMA, a position he held between 1991 to 2000. He is a director of the Chubb Corporation and serves on the boards of Marriott International, Inc., New York City's Spanish Repertory Theatre, the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Time at the Smithsonian.
The Smithsonian's Board of Regents appointed Small as the Secretary on January 24, 2000 on the strength of his management experience. They hoped he would be able to improve the institution's management and fund-raising, bringing a business style to what had traditionally been a very academic institution. He expanded the commercial sponsorship of museum exhibitions. Roger Sant, the chairman of the executive committee of the Board of Regents, claimed that Small had helped raise $1.1 billion for the institution and contributed half a million dollars himself.
Small's plans were met with considerable resistance. In 2001, Small withdrew his proposal to close the Conservation and Research Center in Front Royal, Virginia (now the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute) after strong opposition from scientists.
In 2004, Small pleaded guilty to violating federal bird-protection laws (ESA, CITES, MBTA) by owning Amazonian tribal artifacts that contained feathers of protected bird species.
In 2006, the Smithsonian agreed to a deal with Showtime Networks to create Smithsonian Networks, a joint venture to create television programming with the Smithsonian's resources. Controversy over the deal emerged when it was disclosed that the network had the right of first refusal for commercial documentaries that rely heavily on Smithsonian collections or staff.
In 2007, Acting Smithsonian Inspector General A. Sprightley Ryan reviewed Small's expenses and reported that $90,000 of expenses between 2000 and 2005 were unauthorized, prompting the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington to call on the Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales to investigate whether the spending violated federal law. The U.S. Senate froze a $17 million appropriations increase for the Smithsonian, citing Small's compensation as excessive. On March 26, Small resigned from his position.
A subsequent independent report commissioned by the Smithsonian was highly critical of Small's "imperialistic and insular" management style, including documented resistance to sharing information with the Regents and the audit committee. It also disputed claims earlier made on Small's behalf (see above) on the extent of his personal fund-raising achievements. The Smithsonian in response acknowledged the need to institute reforms in its governance and oversight arrangements.

F. K. Waechter

Friedrich Karl Waechter (3 November 1937 in Danzig – 16 September 2005 in Frankfurt) was a renowned German cartoonist, author, and playwright.
Life.
Waechter was born in Danzig as a son of a teacher. His family fled over the Baltic Sea after World War II and settled in Sahms (Schleswig-Holstein).
Waechter attended the Lauenburg Scholar School in Ratzeburg, where his graphic talents became apparent. He then studied graphic art in Hamburg. In 1962, he moved to Frankfurt and took a job drawing cartoons in an advertisement magazine "Die Zeit". His work attracted the attention of the editors of the soon-to-be satire magazine, "Pardon". They gave Waechter a preliminary copy and asked for his suggestions. Waechter's constructive criticism earned him a job with the fledgling magazine.
While at "Pardon", he co-founded the New Frankfurt School, a group of eminent comic writers and cartoonists. The name was a play on the Frankfurt School of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. The group included Robert Gernhardt, F.W. Bernstein, Bernd Eilert, Eckhard Henscheid, F. W. Ambers, Peter Gnarl, Hans Traxler, and Chlodwig Poth. Their work celebrated subversive nonsense, typified by "Pardon's" regular "Welt in Spiegel" ("In the Mirror") feature.
Waechter became a father and, by 1970, began writing children's books. Many of these encouraged the reader to complete puzzles and drawings, write in the book, cut it up, or otherwise participate in the story. The books appealed to both children and adults and showcased his artistic talents: simple yet expressive cartoons, carefully cross-hatched pen and ink, collage, and realistic paintings. He would write some forty books throughout his life. They are typified by "Anti-Struwwwelpeter" ("Anti-Strawpeter," a parody of Heinrich Hoffman's popular German children's book, "Struwwelpeter"), "Die Schoepfung" (Waechter's re-telling of Biblical creation), and "Der Kronenklauer" ("The Crown Snatchers," an anti-authoritarian fable).
In 1979 he co-founded "Titanic", another satirical magazine. His cartoons featured regularly until 1992, when he began focusing on teaching, writing books, and writing and directing plays.
Waechter's final work was "Vollmond" ("Full Moon"), a fantastic tale of a space journey. He completed it while undergoing treatment for lung cancer. He died on September 16, 2005 at the age of 67, leaving behind a wife and three sons.

<doc id="9790323" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9790323" title="Arthur Schopenhauer's criticism of Immanuel Kant's schemata">
Arthur Schopenhauer's criticism of Immanuel Kant's schemata

Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata is part of Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy which was published in 1819. In the appendix to the first volume of his main work, Arthur Schopenhauer attempted to assign the psychological cause of Kant's doctrines of the categories and their schemata.
From pure intuitions to pure concepts.
Schopenhauer claimed that Kant had made an important discovery. This was his realization that time and space are known by the human mind (Gemüt) apart from any worldly experience. In fact, they are merely the ways that the mind organizes sensations. Succession is time. Position, shape, and size are space. The pure forms of time and space are the basis of the perceptions that constitute experience of objects in the external world.
According to Schopenhauer's psychological hypothesis, Kant "… aimed at finding for every empirical function of the faculty of knowledge an analogous "a priori" function … ." Kant's tacit reasoning was similar to the following: "If pure intuition is the foundation of empirical intuition, then pure concepts are the foundation of empirical concepts." From this symmetrical analogy, Kant claimed that the human mind has a pure understanding, just as he had previously claimed that the mind has a pure sensibility. This pure understanding, according to Kant, consists of pure concepts or categories which allow the mind to discursively think about the objects that are intuitively perceived as being arranged in time and space.
Using intuitions to substantiate concepts.
Kant wrote that "To demonstrate the reality of our concepts, intuitions are required." Since empirical concepts are derived from perceptions, examples of the intuitive perceptions can be used to verify the concept. Kant asserted that pure concepts, or categories of the understanding, can also be verified by inspecting their intuitions or schemata. "If the concepts are empirical, the intuitions are called examples: if they are pure concepts of the understanding, the intuitions are called schemata." Schopenhauer described the use of examples in the following way: 
Pure concepts and the pure intuitional form of time.
Kant preferred to create arrangements in symmetrical, analogous tables or lists. For Kant, the symmetrical analogues of empirical examples are the "a priori" schemata. But, in the case of pure concepts and their schemata, how could a reference be made to intuitive perceptions? Schopenhauer declares that concepts "a priori" "… have not sprung from perception, but come to it from within, first to receive a content from it. Therefore they have as yet nothing on which they could look back verification. The only intuition that "a priori" concepts can be referred to is the pure intuitional form of time, according to Kant. Time, the mind's ability to know succession, is the only content of a pure, "a priori" concept of the understanding, or category. "The schemata," he wrote, "therefore are nothing but determinations of time "a priori" according to rules … .".
Kant's use of symmetrical analogy.
Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata was done, according to him, to help solve the mystery of Kant's way of philosophizing. He tried to show that "… after the happy discovery of the two forms of intuition or perception "a priori" (space and time), Kant attempts, under the guidance of analogy, to demonstrate for every determination of our empirical knowledge an analogue "a priori", and this finally extends in the schemata even to a mere psychological fact. Here the apparent depth of thought and the difficulty of the discussion merely serve to conceal from the reader the fact that its content remains an entirely undemonstrable and merely arbitrary assumption." 
Empirical concepts are ultimately based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) also have a basis. This pure basis is supposed to be a kind of pure perception, which he called a schema. But such an empiricist analogy contradicts his previous rationalist assertion that pure concepts (Categories) simply exist in the human mind without having been derived from perceptions. Therefore they are not based on pure, schematic perceptions.
References to Schopenhauer's discussion.
In his 1909 book "Kant's Philosophy as Rectified by Schopenhauer", Michael Kelly drew attention to Schopenhauer's discussion of Kant's Schemata. In his Preface, Dr. Kelly justified his book by saying: "…a short exposition of Transcendental
Idealism with Schopenhauer's constructive and
destructive criticism may be of use to those
that cannot make a simultaneous study of Kant
and Schopenhauer in the original. To think
that the former can be understood without the
latter is a fatal delusion. If anybody should
doubt this, let him try to make out what Kant
meant by the ' Schematismus,' and he will
soon find it advisable to avail himself of the
assistance of a man who is worth ten times
more than all the post-Kantian philosophers and
professors put together."
In Chapter XI, Dr. Kelly provided a condensation of Schopenhauer's explanation of Kant's false analogy between empirical and pure cognitions:
Having sought to find an "a priori" cognitive faculty corresponding to every empirical ["a posteriori"] one, Kant remarked that, in order to make sure that we are not leaving the solid ground of perception, we often refer back from the empirical ["a posteriori"] abstract idea to the latter [the perception. The temporary representative of the idea thus called forth, and which is never fully adequate to it, he calls a 'schema,' in contradistinction to the complete image. He now maintains that, as such a schema stands between the empirical ["a posteriori" idea and the clear sensual perception, so also similar ones stand between the "a priori" perceptive faculty of the sensibility and the "a priori" thinking faculty of the pure understanding. To each category, accordingly, corresponds a special schema. But Kant overlooks the fact that, in the case of the empirically ["a posteriori" acquired ideas we refer back to the perception from which they have obtained their content, whereas the "a priori" ideas [concepts, which have as yet no content, come to the perception from within in order to receive something from it. They have, therefore, nothing to which they can refer back, and the analogy [of the "a priori" schema with the empirical ["a posteriori"] schema falls to the ground.

Battle for Height 776

The Battle for Height 776, part of the larger Battle of Ulus-Kert, was an engagement in the Second Chechen War that took place during fighting for control of the Argun River gorge in the highland Shatoysky District of central Chechnya, between the villages of Ulus-Kert and Selmentausen.
In late February 2000, the Russian military attempted to surround and destroy a large Chechen separatist force (including many foreign fighters) withdrawing from the Chechen capital Grozny to Shatoy and Vedeno in the southern mountains of Chechnya following the 1999–2000 siege and capture of Grozny and the rebel main force's breakout from the city earlier that month. On 29 February 2000, just hours after Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev had assured his government that the Chechen War was over, an isolated Russian force based around a company of paratroopers of the 76th Airborne Division from the city of Pskov found itself cut off by a retreating Chechen column led by Ibn Al-Khattab, commander of foreign fighters in Chechnya. After heavy close-quarters overnight fighting, Russian positions on the hill were overrun and most of the soldiers were killed.
Uncertainty continues to surround many aspects of the engagement, including the number of combatants, casualties, how much artillery support and close air support was provided, and even how long the battle lasted.
Battle.
The goal of a regimental combat group task force of the Russian Airborne Troops (VDV) tactical group in the area, based on the 104th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 76th Division and including also teams from the Spetsnaz, GRU, and the elite Vympel group of FSB, was to block an exit from a gorge, while other Russian forces attempted to encircle a large Chechen force departing the village of Ulus Kert. The 6th Company, part of the regiment's 2nd Battalion, was part of this blocking force. The company's nominal commander was Major Sergey Molodov; however, it was actually led personally by Lieutenant Colonel Mark Yevtyukhin, commander of the entire battalion. With him were a reconnaissance platoon and an artillery forward observer team led by Captain Viktor Romanov.
At dawn of 29 February, in dense fog, the Russians were surprised by a large-scale Chechen breakthrough and were attacked from their rear by a reconnaissance group of about 20 rebel fighters, soon joined by many more who then had them surrounded. After suffering heavy losses (including the death of Major Molodov) from the initial ambush, the rest of the Russians retreated to a hilltop designated Height 776, where they hastily dug defensive positions. They received fire support, including from the regimental artillery battalion's 2S9 Nona self-propelled 120 mm mortars; however, a pair of Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters reportedly turned back after being shot at en route. The only Russian reinforcement that made it to Height 776 were 14 men of the 4th Company's third platoon, personally led by the battalion's deputy commander, Major Alexander Dostavalov. Attempts by the 1st and 3rd Companies, as well as the rest of the 4th Company, to rescue their surrounded comrades or to stop the breakthrough were largely unsuccessful. Eventually, badly wounded Captain Romanov allegedly called for fire support on his own position before being overrun in the final Chechen attack. According to the Russians, 84 of their soldiers were killed in combat at Height 776, including all of the officers. Only seven rank-and-file soldiers survived the battle, four of them injured (some Russian sources acknowledge only six survivors, not counting the seventh who had answered a call for surrender and was then beaten, stripped out of his uniform and abandoned by the rebels).
Controversies.
The battle embarrassed Russian military officials, who attempted to conceal the casualties they had suffered. Russia's top military leaders (including Marshal of the Russian Federation Sergeyev, VDV commander General Georgy Shpak, and the commander of federal forces in Chechnya, General Gennady Troshev) initially insisted that only 31 of their men were killed in the battle and denied the unofficial rumours of 86 dead. Sergey Yastrzhembsky, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman on Chechnya, also claimed 31 fatalities were "the total losses of that company for several days". After days of denials, Russian officials eventually admitted the losses, some of them apparently caused by friendly fire from their own artillery. Russian newspapers reported that Marshal Sergeyev had ordered the losses to be covered up, as the loss came just a week after 25 men from the 76th Airborne Division were killed in another battle in Chechnya. Even after the figure of "at least 85" killed has been confirmed by Sergeyev, VDV deputy commander Nikolai Staskov said they were killed over four days, from 29 February to 3 March. According to one source, "unofficially the losses sustained by Russian paratroopers on 1 March are blamed the Russian command on the decision of the Eastern group's commander Gen. Sergey Makarov and the VDV tactical group's commander Aleksandr Lentsov." The final figure ultimately stood at 84. However the total Russian strength and the losses among the other Russian units operating in the area of Ulus-Kert were never officially disclosed.
In the first days after the battle, Gen. Troshev said 1,000 rebel fighters were involved. This figure was subsequently raised to 1,500–2,000 by Yastrzhembsky and eventually to 2,500 by Troshev. However, according to a statement by Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, there were only 2,500 to 3,500 separatist fighters left in all of Chechnya at this time. According to Yastrzhembsky on 6 March, some 70 rebels had laid down their arms at what he called a "pocket" at Selmentausen, while "up to 1,000 might have succeeded in escaping". The very first Russian official statements mentioned the death of 100 Chechen fighters at the price of 31 Russian soldiers. According to the article in "Krasnaya Zvezda" ("Red Star"), the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, separatist casualties in the Argun Gorge area totaled approximately 400 dead, including 200 bodies allegedly found at Height 776. However, the official federal estimate was later raised to about 500 enemy dead, according to the Russian government website, and in 2008 the state-controlled English-language TV station Russia Today spoke even of over 700 fighters killed there.
On 10 March, Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov announced a general order to begin "an all-out partisan war" and the separatist forces remaining in the still unoccupied territories scattered to launch a long guerrilla war. The Russian command thus lost one of their last chances to defeat a large number of the pro-independence fighters in a concentrated position, although in March the federal forces managed to inflict devastating losses against a different column of some 1,000–1,500 fighters (trapping the group under Ruslan Gelayev in the village of Komsomolskoye on 6 March and then killing hundreds of them in the following siege).
While there were no civilians in the immediate proximity of the clashes at the uninhabited Height 776, there were severe civilian casualties during the struggle for the broader Argun Gorge area, in particular from the artillery and air attacks on Ulus-Kert, Yaryshmardy and other villages, where thousands of locals and refugees from Grozny were trapped. Furthermore, there were many credible reports of direct atrocities against the population. For example, on 6 March, a group of civilians was detained by soldiers at the notorious Russian checkpoint on the road between Ulus-Kert and Duba-Yurt; 12 men from the group "disappeared" and the bodies of three of them were unearthed at the nearby village of Tangi-Chu two months later. In an infamous incident later in March, a local girl, Elza Kungayeva, was abducted from her home in Tangi-Chu, then raped and strangled to death by Russian Ground Forces Colonel Yuri Budanov.
Aftermath.
Later, it was seen as a glorious last stand by the paratroopers, confirming the VDV's reputation in the same way that the Battle of Camarón did for the French Foreign Legion, and the events have been quickly enshrined in heroic myth. Even though some in the Russian army view it as a defeat that could have been avoided, it is officially seen in Russia as an example of bravery and sacrifice.
In 2001, Putin flew to Chechnya to visit the former battlefield. In 2008, a day before Russia's Defender of the Fatherland Day, a street in Grozny was officially renamed as "84 Pskov Paratroopers Street", a move that sparked further controversy in Chechnya.
Awards.
On 12 March 2000, President Putin signed an "ukaz" conferring Russian state awards upon participants of the battle. 63 soldiers received the Order of Courage and 22 (all 13 officers and nine enlisted men) were awarded the country's highest medal and title of the Hero of the Russian Federation. In comparison, only 65 medals of the Hero of the Soviet Union medal were awarded for the entire duration of the 10-year Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
Hero of the Russian Federation recipients for this incident are:
In popular culture.
A series of Russian productions loosely based on these events were produced in the years after the battle, including a 2004 theatrical musical show, the 2004 television series "Chest imeyu" ("I Have the Honour"), the 2006 four-part television film "Grozovye vorota" ("The Storm Gate") and the 2006 movie "Proriv" ("Breakthrough").

<doc id="9790492" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9790492" title="Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund">
Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund

The Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund, now called BHSF, was founded in 1873 to raise money for hospitals in Birmingham, England.
Sunday Fund.
Unlike the General Hospital, which was funded by concerts of the Birmingham Triennial Music Festivals, the Queen's Hospital had no regular large-scale funding. There was a "subscription of artisans" in 1847 and fetes in Aston Hall in 1856 and 1857. In 1859 the rector of St Martin in the Bull Ring started the Hospital Sunday Fund with church collections donated to Queen's Hospital and other hospitals.
As the out-patient facilities at Queen's were grossly inadequate Sampson Gamgee, one of its surgeons, instigated the construction of a new out-patients wing and suggested engaging the help of the working classes in raising funds. At a meeting in Birmingham Town Hall in January 1869, chaired by George Dawson, Gamgee's suggestion was put forward and accepted. An amount of £3,500 was raised in 1871. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 1871. The original fund was then disbanded in 1872. The wing cost £10,000 and was formally opened on 7 November 1873.
Saturday Fund.
On 6 January 1873 Sampson Gamgee raised the suggestion that 'everyone should work overtime for the hospitals on a particular annual Saturday afternoon, to be called "Hospital Saturday"'. This new scheme called the Birmingham Hospital Saturday Fund was inaugurated on 15 March 1873 with John Skirrow Wright as Chair and Sampson Gamgee as Honorary Secretary, and was the first British scheme for raising money for all voluntary hospitals in an area. By 1879 the collection had dwindled and it was decided to replace them with a fixed weekly contribution of 1d. On 29 December 1891 the fund was incorporated as a limited non-profit company and was able to hold property, and in 1892 Tyn-y-coed, a stone house on a site near Llandudno in North Wales, opened as a convalescent home after its purchase price was donated by two Birmingham sisters, Henrietta and Sarah Stokes.
Further homes were opened around the country.
In 1895 the BHSF started an ambulance service with four custom-designed cycle ambulances, based on a stretcher held between two bicycles. These were low cost devices which could be kept at police stations around the city and did not need assigned staff or horses.
The period after the 1960s saw a merger of similar funds around the country and later, in 2001, the merger of the Hull-based "The Health Scheme (THS)" with BHSF.
On the first Saturday, 15 March 1873, the amount raised was £4,700 from a population of 355,000, an average of 2 3/4d. per head. This figure had increased to £400,000 by 1938. In addition to donations to the Queen's, General, Children's, Women's, Eye, and Dental hospitals, the fund implemented convalescent homes around Britain and an ambulance service. Today it continues as a national non-profit health insurance service.

History.
'Uncle Ray' Jenkins started his career in 1965. At that time, he sold products out of the back seat of his Dodge Dart. In 1967, Ray bought 'Cabana,' a pork skins manufacturer, for $1,200 and began selling extruded corn and cheese products. Still operating under the name 'Cabana', Ray purchased a facility in Dearborn, Michigan in 1969. By 1983, Ray was ready to expand and bought the old Superior Potato Chip factory on the west side of Detroit.
In 1993, Ray was ready to retire and sold the business to AmeriFoods. The company held Cabana Foods for only two years before selling it back to Ray. It was at this time that Ray changed the company name to Jenkins Foods and launched the 'Uncle Ray's' brand. In April 2006, Ray sold the business to a large privately held company. The new company was established under the 'Uncle Ray's, LLC' name. Ray is still active with the company, serving as president.

Burglary (Bottom)

"Burglary" is the third episode of the second series of British television sitcom, "Bottom". It was first broadcast on 15 October 1992.
Synopsis.
Richie and Eddie catch a burglar in their living room.
Plot.
The episode begins with Eddie staggering drunkenly into the flat. He went out with £1.75 to buy a fish supper for himself and Richie, but instead of going to the fish and chip shop, he went to the chemist and spent the money on cheap Old Spice, which he drank. While trying to find alcohol around the flat, Eddie drinks a bottle of bleach, and passes out. Richie can't revive him, and so attaches a noose to his leg and hoists him upstairs to bed. Richie goes to his bedroom to indulge in some masturbation.
A few seconds later, we hear a window smashing. Richie comes out of his bedroom and we hear more objects breaking downstairs. Richie wakes Eddie up. They spend a few minutes deciding what to do. Richie says that the burglars might be looking for drugs, so Eddie suggests throwing Lemsip down the stairs for them. Eddie goes back into his bedroom and brings a service revolver back out with him, and goes to shoot the lock off the hatch into the attic, until Richie asks why they don't just use the key. There is no ladder, as it was confiscated by the police when some nurses moved in next door, so Richie has to climb on Eddie's back to reach. Richie falls off Eddie's back, and down the stairs, landing on the burglar (played by Paul Bradley, best known as Nigel Bates in "EastEnders").
Richie and Eddie tie the burglar to a chair using Sellotape, and try to interrogate him, although they don't really know how to go about doing this. Richie calls the police, but puts the phone down half way through when Eddie finds the burglar's bag, which is full of silverware. Richie tries ending the phone call by claiming that he has been sleep-telephoning again. They plan to sell the silver and make a new life in the Bahamas, and are walking out of the flat when they realise that something must be done with the burglar. Eddie suggests killing him by feeding him stale fish fingers. They don't have any fish fingers, so Richie sends Eddie onto the roof to get some poisoned pigeon pellets. While outside, we see that a second burglar is on the outer wall of the flat. Eddie falls through the glass roof but gets some pellets, which Richie puts into one of the cups of tea he is making. They take the tea to the burglar but can't remember which cup contains the poison, especially as all the cups are the same colour, so, after Richie punishes Eddie by shoving a pencil up his nose, they force the burglar to drink all of them. The burglar promptly vomits. The police knock on the door.
Richie answers the door to the police while Eddie tries to hide the burglar. Richie claims that he telephoned the police in his sleep, and tries to close the door, but the police officers force their way past Richie into the flat. The police are suspicious about the state of the flat, but Richie says that he caused the mess by "sleep-vomiting". One of the officers approaches Eddie and asks "Do you realise that you have a pencil up your nose?" then Eddie says that he has been "sleep-doodling" again. The officer points out that his paper is upside down and Eddie then says "So are my eyes". The officers find the shattered glass and Richie says he has been "sleep-glazing" again. Richie then throws insults to the officers and says that he has just been "sleep-slanging" again. The officers leave, after hitting Richie on the head with a truncheon for wasting police time. Eddie reveals that he had hidden the burglar by Sellotaping him to the ceiling. While they are attempting to get the burglar down by hitting him with a broom, the second burglar comes in through the window, and knocks Richie and Eddie unconscious with a club.
When Richie and Eddie wake up, they are stripped to their underwear. The room has been stripped bare except for two chairs that the pair are tied to. They have mouse traps positioned in front of their genitalia, and Eddie has a note attached to his knee. The episode ends when Eddie reads the note, which says "Sue Carpenter". This drops their guard, causing the mousetraps to trigger. Despite losing all their belongings, it is assumed everything is recovered by the police and returned to them as future episodes show the flat the way it was before. It is also never mentioned again by anybody in future episodes if the police ever caught the burglars.

Byzantine Iconoclasm

The Byzantine Iconoclasm (, "Eikonomachía") refers to two periods in the history of the Byzantine Empire when the use of religious images or icons was opposed by religious and imperial authorities within the Eastern Church and the temporal imperial hierarchy. The "First Iconoclasm", as it is sometimes called, lasted between about 726 and 787. The "Second Iconoclasm" was between 814 and 842. According to the traditional view, Byzantine Iconoclasm constituted a ban on religious images by Emperor Leo III and continued under his successors. It was accompanied by widespread destruction of images and persecution of supporters of the veneration of images. The Western church remained firmly in support of the use of images throughout the period, and the whole episode widened the growing divergence between the East and Western traditions in what was still a unified church, as well as facilitating the reduction or removal of Byzantine political control over parts of Italy.
Iconoclasm, Greek for "image-breaking", is the deliberate destruction within a culture of the culture's own religious icons and other symbols or monuments, usually for religious or political motives. People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called "iconoclasts", a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any person who breaks or disdains established dogmata or conventions. Conversely, people who revere or venerate religious images are derisively called "iconolaters" (). They are normally known as "iconodules" (), or "iconophiles" (). These terms were, however, not a part of the Byzantine debate over images. They have been brought into common usage by modern historians (from the seventeenth century) and their application to Byzantium increased considerably in the late twentieth century. The Byzantine term for the debate over religious imagery, "iconomachy" means "struggle over images" or "image struggle".
Iconoclasm has generally been motivated theologically by an Old Covenant interpretation of the Ten Commandments, which forbade the making and worshipping of "graven images", see also Biblical law in Christianity. The two periods of iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire during the 8th and 9th centuries made use of this theological theme in discussions over the propriety of images of holy figures, including Christ, the Virgin (or Theotokos) and saints. It was a debate triggered by changes in Orthodox worship, which were themselves generated by the major social and political upheavals of the seventh century for the Byzantine Empire.
Traditional explanations for Byzantine iconoclasm have sometimes focused on the importance of Islamic prohibitions against images influencing Byzantine thought. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, for example, it was the prestige of Islamic military successes in the 7th and 8th centuries that motivated Byzantine Christians to adopt the Islamic position of rejecting and destroying idolatrous images. The role of women and monks in supporting the veneration of images has also been asserted. Social and class-based arguments have been put forward, such as that iconoclasm created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society; that it was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire who had to constantly deal with Arab raids. On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of Constantinople and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces strongly opposed Iconoclasm. In recent decades in Greece, Iconoclasm has become a favorite topic of progressive and Marxist historians and social scientists, who consider it a form of medieval class struggle and have drawn inspiration from it. Re-evaluation of the written and material evidence relating to the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm by scholars including John Haldon and Leslie Brubaker, has challenged many of the basic assumptions and factual assertions of the traditional account.
Background.
Christian worship by the sixth century had developed a clear hierarchy of intercession, which regulated the access of believers to the divine. This hierarchy constituted the Trinity at its pinnacle (with Christ as its most accessible member because of his human experience), followed by the Virgin, referred to as the 'God-bearer' or Theotokos in Greek writing, the saints, and finally, the believer. Thus, in order to obtain divine favour, believers would pray to saints or the Theotokos in order that this intercessor might pass on their prayer to Christ. The notion of physical proximity to the holy increasing the power of intercession was also well-established by the sixth century. Believers would, therefore, make pilgrimages to places sanctified by the physical presence of Christ or prominent saints, such as the site of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Proximity could also be gained by access to relics, objects (rather than places) which were a part of the remains, or had come into contact with, Christ, the Virgin or a saint. Relics, a firmly embedded part of veneration by this period, increased the availability of access to the divine but were not infinitely reproducible (an original relic was required), and still usually required believers to undertake pilgrimage or have contact with somebody who had.
The use and abuse of images had greatly increased during this period, and had generated a growing opposition among many in the church, although the progress and extent of these views is now unclear. Images in the form of mosaics and paintings were widely used in churches, homes and other places such as over city gates, and had since the reign of Justinian I been increasingly taking on a spiritual significance of their own, and regarded at least in the popular mind as capable of possessing capacities in their own right, so that "the image acts or behaves as the subject itself is expected to act or behave. It makes known its wishes ... It enacts evangelical teachings, ... When attacked it bleeds, ... In some cases it defends itself against infidels with physical force ...". Key artefacts to blur this boundary emerged in c. 570 in the form of miraculously created "acheiropoieta" or "images not made by human hands". These sacred images were a form of contact relic, which additionally were taken to prove divine approval of the use of icons. The two most famous were the Mandylion of Edessa (where it still remained) and the Image of Camuliana from Cappadocia, by then in Constantinople. The latter was already regarded as a palladium that had won battles and saved Constantinople from the Persian-Avar siege of 626, when the Patriarch paraded it around the walls of the city. Both were images of Christ, and at least in some versions of their stories supposedly made when Christ pressed a cloth to his face (compare with the later, western Veil of Veronica and Turin shroud). In other versions of the Mandylion's story it joined a number of other images that were believed to have been painted from the life in the New Testament period by Saint Luke or other human painters, again demonstrating the support of Christ and the Virgin for icons, and the continuity of their use in Christianity since its start.
The events of the seventh century, which was a period of major crisis for the Byzantine Empire, formed a catalyst for the expansion of the use of images of the holy and caused a dramatic shift in responses to them. Whether the "acheiropoieta" were a symptom or cause, the late sixth to eighth centuries witnessed the increasing thinning of the boundary between images not made by human hands, and images made by human hands. Images of Christ, the Theotokos and saints increasingly came to be regarded, as relics, contact relics and "acheiropoieta" already were, as points of access to the divine. By praying to an image of a holy figure, the believer's prayers were magnified by proximity to the holy. This change in practice seems to have been a major and organic development in Orthodox worship, which responded to the needs of believers to have access to divine support during the insecurities of the seventh century. It was not a change orchestrated or controlled by the Church. The events which have traditionally been labelled 'Byzantine Iconoclasm' may be seen as the efforts of the organised Church and the imperial authorities to respond to these changes and to try to reassert some institutional control over popular practice.
The rise of Islam in the seventh century had also caused some consideration of the use of holy images. Early Islamic belief stressed the impropriety of iconic representation. Earlier scholarship tried to link Byzantine Iconoclasm directly to Islam by arguing that Byzantine emperors saw the success of the early Caliphate and decided that Byzantine use of images (as opposed to Islamic aniconism) had angered God. This does not seem entirely plausible however. The use of images had probably been increasing in the years leading up to the outbreak of iconoclasm. One notable change came in 695, when Justinian II put a full-faced image of Christ on the obverse of his gold coins. The effect on iconoclast opinion is unknown, but the change certainly caused Caliph Abd al-Malik to break permanently with his previous adoption of Byzantine coin types to start a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only. This appears more like two opposed camps asserting their positions (pro and anti images) than one empire seeking to imitate the other. More striking is the fact that Islamic iconoclasm rejected any depictions of living people or animals, not only religious images. By contrast, Byzantine iconomachy concerned itself only with the question of the holy presence (or lack thereof) of images. Thus, although the rise of Islam may have created an environment in which images were at the forefront of intellectual question and debate, Islamic iconoclasm does not seem to have had a direct causal role in the development of the Byzantine image debate.
The goal of the iconoclasts was to restore the church to the strict opposition to images in worship that they believed characterized at the least some parts of the early church. Theologically, one aspect of the debate, as with most in Orthodox theology at the time, revolved around the two natures of Jesus. Iconoclasts believed that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of the Messiah at the same time, but separately. Because an icon which depicted Jesus as purely physical would be Nestorianism, and one which showed Him as both human and divine would not be able to do so without confusing the two natures into one mixed nature, which was Monophysitism, all icons were thus heretical. Reference was also made to the prohibitions on the worship of graven images in the Mosaic Law but the nature of Biblical law in Christianity has always been in dispute. However, no detailed writings setting out iconoclast arguments have survived; we have only brief quotations and references in the writings of the iconodules.
Sources.
A thorough understanding of the Iconoclast period in Byzantium is complicated by the fact that most of the surviving sources were written by the ultimate victors in the controversy, the iconodules. It is thus difficult to obtain a complete, objective, balanced, and reliably accurate account of events and various aspects of the controversy. The period was marked by intensely polarized debate amongst at least the clergy, and both sides came to regard the position of the other as heresy, and accordingly made efforts to destroy the writings of the other side when they had the chance. Leo III is said to have ordered the destruction of iconodule texts at the start of the controversy, and the records of the final Second Council of Nicaea record that books with missing pages were reported and produced to the council. Many texts, including works of hagiography and historical writing as well as sermons and theological writings, were undoubtedly "improved", fabricated or backdated by partisans, and the difficult and highly technical scholarly process of attempting to assess the real authors and dates of many surviving texts remains ongoing. Most iconoclastic texts are simply missing, including a proper record of the council of 754, and the detail of iconoclastic arguments have mostly to be reconstructed with difficulty from their vehement rebuttals by iconodules.
Major historical sources for the period include the chronicles of Theophanes the Confessor and the Patriarch Nikephoros, both of whom were ardent iconodules. Many historians have also drawn on hagiography, most notably the "Life of St. Stephen the Younger", which includes a detailed, but highly biased, account of persecutions during the reign of Constantine V. No account of the period in question written by an iconoclast has been preserved, although certain saints' lives do seem to preserve elements of the iconoclast worldview.
Major theological sources include the writings of John of Damascus, Theodore the Studite, and the Patriarch Nikephoros, all of them iconodules. The theological arguments of the iconoclasts survive only in the form of selective quotations embedded in iconodule documents, most notably the Acts of the Second Council of Nicaea and the "Antirrhetics" of Nikephoros.
The first iconoclast period: 730–787.
An immediate precursor of the controversy seems to have been a large submarine volcanic eruption in the summer of 726 in the Aegean Sea between the island of Thera (modern Santorini) and Therasia, probably causing tsunamis and great loss of life. Many, probably including Leo III, interpreted this as a judgement on the Empire by God, and decided that use of images had been the offence.
The classic account of the beginning of Byzantine Iconoclasm relates that sometime between 726 and 730 the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ordered the removal of an image of Christ, prominently placed over the Chalke Gate, the ceremonial entrance to the Great Palace of Constantinople, and its replacement with a cross. Fearing that they intended sacrilege, some of those who were assigned to the task were murdered by a band of iconodules. Accounts of this event (written significantly later) suggest that at least part of the reason for the removal may have been military reversals against the Muslims and the eruption of the volcanic island of Thera, which Leo possibly viewed as evidence of the Wrath of God brought on by image veneration in the Church.
Leo is said to have described mere image veneration as "a craft of idolatry." He apparently forbade the veneration of religious images in a 730 edict, which did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross. "He saw no need to consult the Church, and he appears to have been surprised by the depth of the popular opposition he encountered". Germanos I of Constantinople, the iconodule Patriarch of Constantinople, either resigned or was deposed following the ban. Surviving letters Germanos wrote at the time say little of theology. According to Patricia Karlin-Hayter, what worried Germanos was that the ban of icons would prove that the Church had been in error for a long time and therefore play into the hands of Jews and Muslims. 
This interpretation is now in doubt, and the debate and struggle may have initially begun in the provinces rather than in the imperial court. Letters survive written by the Patriarch Germanos in the 720s and 730s concerning Constantine, the bishop of Nakoleia, and Thomas of Klaudioupolis. In both sets of letters (the earlier ones concerning Constantine, the later ones Thomas), Germanos reiterates a pro-image position while lamenting the behaviour of his subordinates in the church, who apparently had both expressed reservations about image worship. Germanos complains "now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter". In both cases, efforts to persuade these men of the propriety of image veneration had failed and some steps had been taken to remove images from their churches. Significantly, in these letters Germanos does not threaten his subordinates if they fail to change their behaviour, he does not seem to refer to a factional split in the church, but rather to an ongoing issue of concern, and Germanos refers to the Emperor Leo III, often presented as the original Iconoclast, as a friend of images. Germanos' concerns are mainly that the actions of Constantine and Thomas should not confuse the laity.
At this stage in the debate there is no clear evidence for an imperial involvement in the debate, except that Germanos says he believes that Leo III supports images, leaving a question as to why Leo III has been presented as the arch-iconoclast of Byzantine history. Almost all of the evidence for the reign of Leo III is derived from textual sources, the majority of which post-date his reign considerably, most notably the Life by Stephen the Younger and the Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor. These important sources are fiercely iconodule and are hostile to the Emperor Constantine V (741-775). As Constantine's father, Leo also became a target. Leo's actual views on icon veneration remain obscure, but in any case may not have influenced the initial phase of the debate.
During this initial period, concern on both sides seems to have had little to do with theology and more with practical evidence and effects. There was initially no church council, and no prominent patriarchs or bishops called for the removal or destruction of icons. In the process of destroying or obscuring images, Leo is said to have ""confiscated valuable church plate, altar cloths, and reliquaries decorated with religious figures"", but he took no severe action against the former patriarch or iconophile bishops.
In the West, Pope Gregory III held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions, and in response Leo confiscated papal estates in Calabria and Sicily, detaching them as well as Illyricum from Papal governance and placing them under the governance of the Patriarch of Constantinople.
Ecumenical councils.
Leo died in 741, and his son and heir, Constantine V (741–775), was personally committed to an anti-image position. Despite his successes as an emperor, both militarily and culturally, this has caused Constantine to be remembered unfavourably by a body of source material which is preoccupied by his opposition to image veneration. In 754 Constantine summoned the Council of Hieria in which some 330 to 340 bishops participated and which was the first church council to concern itself primarily with religious imagery. Constantine seems to have been closely involved with the council and it endorsed an iconoclast position, with 338 assembled bishops declaring, "the unlawful art of painting living creatures blasphemed the fundamental doctrine of our salvation--namely, the Incarnation of Christ, and contradicted the six holy synods. . . . If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, etc. . . . let him be anathema." This Council claimed to be the legitimate "Seventh Ecumenical Council", but its legitimacy is disregarded by both Eastern and Western traditions as no patriarchs or representatives of the five patriarchs were present: Constantinople was vacant while Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria were controlled by Muslims, and Rome did not send a representative.
The iconoclast Council of Hieria was not the end of the matter, however. In this period complex theological arguments appeared, both for and against the use of icons. Constantine himself wrote opposing the veneration of images and John of Damascus, a Syrian monk living outside of Byzantine territory, became a major opponent of iconoclasm through his theological writings. It has been suggested that monasteries became secret bastions of icon-support but there is little evidence to support such a factionalist argument. Certainly, some monks continued to support image veneration, but many others followed church and imperial policy.
A possible reason for this interpretation is the desire in some historiography on Byzantine Iconoclasm to see it as a preface to the later Protestant Reformation in western Europe, in which monastic establishments suffered damage and persecution. The surviving sources also accuse Constantine of moving against monasteries, having relics thrown into the sea, and stopping the invocation of saints. Monks were apparently forced to parade in the Hippodrome, each hand-in-hand with a woman, in violation of their vows. In 765 St Stephen the Younger was killed, apparently a martyr to the Iconodule cause. A number of large monasteries in Constantinople were secularised, and many monks fled to areas beyond effective imperial control on the fringes of the Empire. None of these accusations, however, stands up to scrutiny. They appear to have been the product of later (post-843) writings, seeking to vilify Constantine V and the Isaurian dynasty.
Constantine's son, Leo IV (775–80) was less rigorous, and for a time tried to mediate between the factions. When he died, his wife Irene took power as regent for her son, Constantine VI (780–97). Though icon veneration does not seem to have been a major priority for the regency government, Irene called an ecumenical council a year after Leo's death, which restored image veneration. This may have been an effort to secure closer and more cordial relations between Constantinople and Rome.
Irene initiated a new ecumenical council, ultimately called the Second Council of Nicaea, which first met in Constantinople in 786 but was disrupted by military units faithful to the iconoclast legacy. The council convened again at Nicaea in 787 and reversed the decrees of the previous iconoclast council held at Constantinople and Hieria, and appropriated its title as Seventh Ecumenical Council. Thus there were two councils called the "Seventh Ecumenical Council," the first supporting iconoclasm, the second supporting icon veneration.
Unlike the iconoclast council, the iconodule council included papal representatives, and its decrees were approved by the papacy. The Eastern Orthodox Church considers it to be the last genuine ecumenical council. Icon veneration lasted through the reign of Empress Irene's successor, Nikephoros I (reigned 802–811), and the two brief reigns after his.
The second iconoclast period: 814–842.
Emperor Leo V the Armenian instituted a second period of Iconoclasm in 815, again possibly motivated by military failures seen as indicators of divine displeasure, and a desire to replicate the military success of Constantine V. The Byzantines had suffered a series of humiliating defeats at the hands of the Bulgarian Khan Krum, in the course of which emperor Nikephoros I had been killed in battle and emperor Michael I Rangabe had been forced to abdicate. In June 813, a month before the coronation of Leo V, a group of soldiers broke into the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles, opened the sarcophagus of Constantine V, and implored him to return and save the empire.
Soon after his accession, Leo V began to discuss the possibility of reviving iconoclasm with a variety of people, including priests, monks, and members of the senate. He is reported to have remarked to a group of advisors that
all the emperors, who took up images and venerated them, met their death either in revolt or in war; but those who did not venerate images all died a natural death, remained in power until they died, and were then laid to rest with all honors in the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles.
Leo next appointed a "commission" of monks "to look into the old books" and reach a decision on the veneration of images. They soon discovered the acts of the Iconoclastic Synod of 754. A first debate followed between Leo's supporters and the clerics who continued to advocate the veneration of icons, the latter group being led by the Patriarch Nikephoros, which led to no resolution. However, Leo had apparently become convinced by this point of the correctness of the iconoclast position, and had the icon of the Chalke gate, which Leo III is fictitiously claimed to have removed once before, replaced with a cross. In 815 the revival of iconoclasm was rendered official by a Synod held in the Hagia Sophia.
Leo was succeeded by Michael II, who in an 824 letter to the Carolingian emperor Louis the Pious lamented the appearance of image veneration in the church and such practices as making icons baptismal godfathers to infants. He confirmed the decrees of the Iconoclast Council of 754.
Michael was succeeded by his son, Theophilus. Theophilus died leaving his wife Theodora regent for his minor heir, Michael III. Like Irene 50 years before her, Theodora presided over the restoration of icon veneration in 843, on the condition that Theophilus not be condemned. Since that time the first Sunday of Great Lent has been celebrated in the Orthodox Church as the feast of the "Triumph of Orthodoxy".
Arguments in the struggle over icons.
Iconoclast arguments.
What accounts of iconoclast arguments remain are largely found in quotations or summaries in iconodule writings. It is thus difficult to reconstruct a balanced view of the popularity or prevalence of iconoclast writings. The major theological arguments, however, remain in evidence because of the need in iconophile writings to record the positions being refuted. Debate seems to have centred on the validity of the depiction of Jesus, and the validity of images of other figures followed on from this for both sides. The main points of the iconoclast argument were:
Iconodule arguments.
The chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur (John of Damascus), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and Theodore the Studite, abbot of the Stoudios monastery in Constantinople.
John declared that he did not worship matter, "but rather the creator of matter." He also declared, "But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace." He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the body and blood of Jesus. This distinction between worship and veneration is key in the arguments of the iconodules.
The iconodule response to iconoclasm included:
Emperors had always intervened in ecclesiastical matters since the time of Constantine I. As Cyril Mango writes, "The legacy of Nicaea, the first universal council of the Church, was to bind the emperor to something that was not his concern, namely the definition and imposition of orthodoxy, if need be by force" That practice continued from beginning to end of the Iconoclast controversy and beyond, with some emperors enforcing iconoclasm, and two empresses regent enforcing the re-establishment of icon veneration.
Art.
The iconoclastic period has drastically reduced the number of survivals of Byzantine art from before the period, especially large religious mosaics, which are now almost exclusively found in Italy and Saint Catherine's Monastery in Islamic Egypt. Important works in Thessaloniki were lost in the Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917 and the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). A large mosaic of a church council in the Imperial Palace was replaced by lively secular scenes, and there was no issue with imagery per se. The plain Iconoclastic cross that replaced a figurative image in the apse of St Irene's is itself an almost unique survival, but careful inspection of some other buildings reveals similar changes. In Nicaea, photographs of the Church of the Dormition, taken before it was destroyed in 1922, show that a pre-iconoclasm standing Theotokos was replaced by a large cross, which was itself replaced by the new Theotokos seen in the photographs. The Image of Camuliana in Constantinople appears to have been destroyed, as mentions of it cease.
Reaction in the West.
The period of Iconoclasm decisively ended the so-called Byzantine Papacy under which, since the reign of Justinian I a century before, the Popes in Rome had been initially nominated by, and later merely confirmed by, the Emperor in Constantinople, and many of them had been Greek-speaking. By the end of the controversy the Pope had approved the creation of a new Emperor in the West, and the old deference of the Western church to Constantinople had gone. Opposition to icons seems to have had little support in the West and Rome took a consistently iconodule position.
When the struggles flared up Pope Gregory II had been pope since 715, not long after accompanying his Syrian predecessor Pope Constantine to Constantinople, where they successfully resolved with Justinian II the issues arising from the provocative anti-Western decisions of the Quinisext Council of 692, which no Western prelates had attended. Of the delegation of 13 Gregory was one of only two non-Easterners; it was to be the last visit of a pope to the Byzantine capital until 1969. There had already been conflicts with Leo III over his very heavy taxation of areas under Roman jurisdiction.

Joe Parkinson

Joseph "Joe" Parkinson (born 11 June 1971 in Eccles, Lancashire) is an English former professional footballer, who played as a midfielder from 1989 until 1999.
He notably played in the Premier League for Everton, while with the club he won the FA Cup in 1995. He also played for Wigan Athletic and Bournemouth.
Playing career.
After stints in the lower leagues with Wigan Athletic and Bournemouth the combative midfielder was signed by managerless Everton on 28 December 1993 for £250,000, between the resignation of Howard Kendall and arrival of Mike Walker. While at the Premier League side he made 107 appearances, scoring 4 goals.
He became a fans' favourite at the club, playing a major part in Joe Royle's "Dogs of War" Everton team. Most memorably he won an FA Cup winner's medal when Everton defeated Manchester United in the 1995 Final.
In April 1997, Parkinson broke down after battling a knee injury most the season, and was ruled out for the remainder of the 1996-97 season as well as the entire 1997-1998 season. Parkinson was unable to return to full fitness. Complications with the injury, including 2 surgeries and a further full season out of the game (1998–1999) resulted in Parkinson retiring from football in November 1999, when only 28. This came two years after his last appearance. Despite the relatively small number of appearances he made, his contribution and commitment was recognised with a testimonial against Manchester City in 2000.
Personal life.
Joe was on Sky Sports show "Where are they now" series in May 2008 and is now a forklift driver at "Smith Bateson". He said he got a normal day job because he just got so bored being at home all the time. In an interview for the BBC in October 2011 Joey Barton said that Joe Parkinson is his favourite footballer of all time. Parkinson has recently re-surfaced in a coaching role with Wigan Athletic.

Vulture (DC Comics)

VULTURE is a fictional international crime cartel in the DC Comics universe. VULTURE first appears in "House of Mystery" #160 (July 1966), and was created by Jack Miller and Joe Certa. 
History.
VULTURE first appeared in "House of Mystery" #160 July (1966), created by Jack Miller and Joe Certa. The organization known as VULTURE was a vast international crime cartel that was infiltrated, thwarted and eventually completely destroyed by J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter. Their secretive leader had a number of aliases: Mister Vulture, Mister V, and Faceless, but was in reality Marco Xavier.
Shortly after retiring his John Jones persona, J'onzz comes into conflict with cartel operatives when he travels to the French Riviera. While in the Riviera he investigates Marco Xavier, an international playboy with supposed links to organized crime. He uses his shape-shifting powers to follow Xavier as he leaves his villa in a high powered sports car. However, Xavier loses control of his vehicle and it plunges off a mountain road, and is apparently killed, his body quickly consumed by the blazing crash. J'onn takes advantage of this accident by quickly transforming himself into a Xavier lookalike, and lowers himself from the branch of a cliffside tree before the police arrive. The disguised "Marco Xavier" is taken to his villa to recover. 
Slowly but surely and using his disguise as Marco Xavier, the Martian Manhunter works his way up through the cartel. While maintaining the original Marco's role as an outside contractor uninterested in joining Vulture, he is eventually able to smash the group from the inside.
J'onn took over the Xavier identity in order to infiltrate VULTURE and they became his main adversaries for the fourteen issues spanning "House of Mystery" #160 through 173 (March-April 1968), the final installment in the Martian's original solo feature. Finally, Vulture maneuvered the Martian Manhunter as Marco Xavier into committing a crime which saw the false playboy hunted as a criminal across Europe. "Xavier" was conveniently rescued by Vulture and brought before Mr. V, who asserted that he knew about the Martian Manhunter's double identity the entire time. 
Faceless unmasked to reveal himself as the true Marco Xavier, claiming to have allowed the masquerade to continue in order to lure the Manhunter into the perfect trap (The only explanation how he survived the car crash was that he 'planned in advance'). Xavier had determined that the Martian was vulnerable to fire, and used it to tame the hero before finishing him off with an experimental handgun. Instead, the weapon malfunctioned, seemingly evaporating Xavier, and leaving the Martian Manhunter to sift through the rubble.
To date, Faceless and Vulture have yet to resurface. Yet, their disappearance left a trail of unanswered questions, including whether the original Marco Xavier was in fact the ultimate Faceless, or if perhaps the organization had simply covered its tracks once again.
Vulture appears to be experts of molecular mutations. The American branch invention has the ability to temporarily transforms ordinary men into indestructible giants (House of Mystery #166). A underground branch created beams that can change someone into purple-skinned werecreature (that breathe fire) and back. (House of Mystery #169) for Crime spree methods.
Other characters named Vulture.
There have been four villains named Vulture who have appeared in comics published or later acquired by DC Comics:

History of Christianity in Zambia

Christianity has been very much at the heart of the narrative the Zambian region since the European colonial explorations into the interior of Africa in the mid 19th century. The area features heavily in the accounts of David Livingstone's journeys in Central Africa.
Establishing Zambia.
Livingstone's exploration of the region coincided with an increased interest in missions in the Evangelical churches in Britain, and, despite his complicated motives, Livingstone became the darling of Evangelical expansion. This interest was partly,
"the result of revivalism among Pietists and Methodists and among the Evangelicals of the Anglican church. People wanted to convert others to the same joyous religious experience they had had".
The rise in missionary zeal was heightened with the expansion of European empires, opening up unknown territories and bringing other cultures to the attention of the newly formed mission societies. Yet another element of this increased mission activity was the desire not to see a repeat of the recent Indian Mutiny, that the Evangelicals, like Livingstone, felt was, "as a result of too little mission activity". It is possible the cause of the mutiny was actually of a religious origin with many of the Indians serving in the British Indian Army convinced, "that the British did indeed have plans to Christianize India", and thereby threatening their faith that was in their view indivisible from their vocation as a soldier, whether as a Hindu, Muslim or Sikh.
Livingstone inspired many Evangelicals in his speech at the Senate House in Cambridge University in 1857 in which he stated,
"I consider we made a great mistake when we carried commerce into India, in being ashamed of our Christianity… those two pioneers of civilisation – Christianity and commerce – should ever be inseparable".
He concluded the speech with the call,
"I go back to Africa to make an open path for Commerce and Christianity; do you carry out the work I have begun. I leave it with you".
Following Livingstone's death in 1873, at Ilala by the shores of Lake Bangweulu in North Eastern Zambia, and the subsequent development of preventatives and cures for malaria based on quinine, mission societies stepped in to take up where he had left off by establishing Christianity in Central Africa. In a report on the Church and development in Zambia the London Missionary Society (LMS) was the first organisation to establish a mission station based at Niamikolo close to Lake Tanganyika in 1885 followed by numerous other mission stations throughout the country. Part of the reason for the rapid spread of these stations was their acceptance among some of the smaller tribes of the northern region of Zambia. They perceived that the, "missionaries… would provide effective protection", from attackers, such as the more powerful Bemba tribe. Other mission stations followed the LMS example and established a presence in other regions. Examples include the Paris Evangelical Mission at Lealui 1892, The Primitive Methodists working among the Illa people in Western Zambia in 1892, the Presbyterians at Mwenzo in 1894. After independence in 1965 these four mission societies were to merge their works and become known as the United Church of Zambia (UCZ). Zambia's increased mission activity was not an isolated case though, globally the number of missionaries rose dramatically during this period. "By the end of the century there were as many as 12,000 British missionaries "in the field", representing no less than 360 different societies and other bodies".
In shaping Zambia's Christianity, it is important that the influence of the Roman Catholic Church is noted. The, "Catholic Church by far the most influential denomination," in the nation. Catholic missionaries first established a mission in 1895 among the Bemba tribe. The Bemba tribe had traditionally been hostile to church activity, partly due to the resistance to settlement by Europeans, but also because their presence strengthened the resolve of rival ethnic groups to resist the Bemba. With the death of the Bemba king Chitimukulu Sampa Kapalakasha and his replacement by a less antagonistic king the way was open for the Catholic White Fathers to establish the mission in the area that was to become the Copperbelt Province of Northern Zambia. In Southern Zambia the Catholic mission activity was undertaken by Jesuit Fathers in the early years of the twentieth century along with the Franciscan friars. Zambia still retains the historical divisions of this early Catholic mission activity; the county is still divided into diocese administered by each of these groups.
The first Anglican mission station would not begin until 1911. This was established by Leonard Kamungu, a priest from Malawi, at Msoro. Kamungu perhaps reflects an aspect of Christianity that set it apart from many of the other structures of colonialism that severely limited if not actively restricted the ability of the local population to take a part in their development, becoming isolated and voiceless from the ruling European elite.
"Though white settlers… were able to organize themselves in Formal groups… the colonial authorities provided little space for urban indigenous people to formally organize. Although there was some tolerance of group activity under the umbrella of the church.
Traditional Anglican involvement in Zambia was undertaken by the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), which had been founded in Cambridge as a direct result of the fiftieth anniversary of Livingstone's call for African evangelism. Though unlike many of Livingstone's original audience the UMCA held to a less Evangelical and more Anglo-Catholic form of Christian theology. Consequently although highly influential, despite its small numbers, modern day Anglicanism in Zambia does not have the Evangelical fervour that is evident elsewhere in modern-day African nations that were formally British colonial possessions.
Livingstone, though certainly at the vanguard of the colonisers, and in that capacity he spelled the end to traditional Zambian society, he is still held in high regard by many contemporary Zambian's. This perhaps reflects an understanding of Livingstone as less of a coloniser and more as a bringer of the Christian faith that today over seventy five percent, more recent surveys put it as high as eighty-five percent, of the population embrace in one form or another. Christianity is still, "growing at a rate of nearly 4 percent per year", in a nation with an annual average population growth rate of 2.7 percent from 1990-99. Possibly some of this affection is also because Livingstone is perceived as a defender of the traditional societies as he defied the slave traders who were already destroying communities; one of his multiple motives for being in the region was anti-slavery and towards the end of his life a primary drive in his work. Though, as with many interventions of this nature, the possible motives were not as philanthropic as they first appeared to those under threat. Livingstone saw the oppressed communities as a basis for his "potential village preaching centres", to spread the gospel and in so doing provide a stable base for European culture. Like much of what Livingstone undertook the reality is complex and in many of his wanderings he was actually forced to rely on the slave trade's logistical networks. Again Livingstone's legacy lives on in many development initiatives undertaken on the continent both in religious and secular capacities, a seemingly positive intervention, which carries wider motives and implications.
Colonial era.
During the period of colonial rule in Zambia, up until independence in 1964, the church attempted to straddle the gulf between ministering to the needs of the local population without antagonising the colonial administration and bringing the local population to a point of passive acceptance of colonial rule. The administration viewed church activity as a possibly practical tool of indoctrination, but at times a vehicle for dissent against colonial rule too.
The traditional view of the Church during this period was to provide social welfare. Churches became primarily involved in education and healthcare. Other initiatives such as orphanages, skills training and agricultural extension were also evident in the development of Zambia during this period. Though at times its role extended into advocacy and the formulation of law and the penal code. mathias
In the matter of healthcare the churches saw the provision of affordable healthcare as vital to a population that could not afford private medical treatment. Even in current-day Zambia, the Catholic Church alone is running 15 hospitals, 28 health centres, 54 home based care institutions. The provision of healthcare had a twofold motivation. Firstly, there was the concern driven by Biblical principles of care for the incapacitated. Examples include the parable of the Good Samaritan Luke 10:25-37, then Jesus' encouragement in Matthew 25:36 "I was sick and you looked after me, " and the Old Testament reprimand to the leaders of Israel, "you have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured," Ezk 34:4, Secondly, it was driven by a perception that the only alternative medical care available to the local population involved traditional healers and their use of, in colonial eyes, unscientific and crude methods as well as possible appeals to animistic or ancestral powers. These latter elements were of particular concern in ecclesiastical circles as, the Church has generally tried to change or discourage cultural practices that are contrary to Christian teaching. Christian missions were at the forefront of social change in Zambia. On the question of traditional penal codes, that were either considered too lenient or too harsh depending on the change the missions wished to see imposed, as opposed to a legal code more in line with that in Britain the Church was instrumental in pushing through reform. The involvement of missionaries was "more than providing correctives – spiritual or otherwise… their real ambition was power". Generally though healthcare had impact on indigenous society it was seen as a reasonably neutral activity by the colonial authorities.
Education on the other hand would prove to be a little more of a double edged sword for the colonial administration. Paradoxically, as the state sought to control education policy by taking out of the hands of the churches so the clamour for the demise of colonial rule, from a mission educated local population, rose. Schools were often found associated with the mission stations. The prime focus of education was on rural areas and the schools themselves retained the flavour of the particular denomination that had established them. Though the PAG report notes, "the exception was to be found on the Copperbelt where the formation of the United Missions in the Copperbelt in the 1930s ushered in inter-denominational schools." The schools usually offered a rudimentary education in basic reading, Bible study and practical subjects beyond this it was felt the local population would have little use for higher education as it could lead to isolation from their communities.
Once more the Bible provided a precedent for missionaries to involve themselves in education, "train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it," Proverbs 22:6. For the missionaries the practical outworking of this exhortation in Zambia was threefold:
The concept of providing only basic education, as was the case with many mission schools, was called into question following a revolt in Malawi in 1918 in which mission trained teachers and former students played a part. The colonial authorities felt that education needed a more formal basis, to be under closer scrutiny and to provide greater openings for the more apt pupils. "The government introduced a proclamation which demanded the registration of schools empowered magistrates and Native Commissioners to inspect schools." By 1922 the General Missionary Conference passed a resolution calling for the "establishment of one or more government colleges or institutions to provide instruction in agriculture, forestry, pedagogy and the duties of chiefs." Further to this the "institution [was to be under the management of a joint council of the nominees or the Administration and representatives of the missions", setting the precedent for partnership between the state and church in education.
From the 1920s onwards there was to be a gradual erosion of the church's primacy in education in Zambia. Understanding the need for increased professionalism among its staff the Anglican Church "closed all its schools for 18 months between 1918 and 1920 and brought all their teachers to Msoro for retraining." The Advisory Board devised the Native School Code by 1927 establishing the state as the arbiter of educational standards in Zambia. The state now had the power to deregister schools that did not operate for the prescribed number of days in a year or did not cover adequately the curriculum developed by the Board. The number of registered mission schools declined significantly during this period. "Of the 547 schools run by the White Fathers only 17 qualified as schools under the new conditions." Part of the reason that the Copperbelt Schools were inter-denominational was the pressure from the Board not to allow contending schools to open up in the towns and repeat the rivalry that was prevalent elsewhere leading to small villages with two schools run by competing missions.
Following the Second World War the government opened its own schools in some provinces. This event was to draw the Christian denominations and indigenous authorities together in a consensus on education in an attempt to reinforce their positions. Some Churches saw the government policy as an attempt to secularise education and resisted the move openly. In 1951 Local Education Authorities (LEA) were established to take control of government schools and were also authorised to take control of any mission schools that the indigenous authorities, mission societies or any other voluntary organisation no longer wanted to administer. Many of the Protestant missions handed their schools over. "By 1963 – the dawn of Zambia's independence – 800 of the 2,100 schools were L.E.A while the rest were mainly agency schools 30 per cent of which were operated by the Catholics."
Despite their decline the mission schools had become the place where the aspiration for independence was established and nurtured, as well as promoting colonial structure they had also encouraged critical thinking enabling students to contest the status quo. "It was the mission centres that became the birthplace of post-war African nationalism." In the wider context the churches had also to become advocates for the people who congregated their buildings for worship and populated their parishes. Although an outside agency they were equipped and informed enough and had sufficient influence both in Zambia and back in Britain to intercede for those who had little voice in the colonial political system. It would not be until after independence that indigenous or even international NGOs would have a comparable voice. Phiri states, "since churches remain 'zones of freedom' and in some cases more or less a 'state within a state', they tend to take up the political functions of repressed organizations. This leads to confrontation with the state.
Weller & Linden cite a Catholic missionary who reported that a missionary from the Presbyterian mission was compelled to complain "to the Foreign Office in London about the behaviour of the company's officials in his area. Villages burnt, and chiefs and headmen put in chains, in order to intimidate them into sending their people to do carrier service." In fact one of the briefs of the General Missionary Council was "to watch over the interests of the Native races." Churches were to involve themselves in diverse campaigns such as poll tax reform, the effects on families due to labour migration and issues of racial inequality.
During this period there was a rise in African Indigenous Churches (AICs). These churches were founded and run by Zambian's who either defected from the mission churches dissatisfied with their European bias or their stayed theology or they were founded during the labour migrations of the 1920s into the Copperbelt. "Among the labourers were Africans who had been introduced to Christianity in their home regions and who, upon discovering no church whatsoever in the Copperbelt, decided to start a church themselves – one that was entirely directed and sustained by Africans." also. It was AICs that would be the initial breeding grounds for nationalist sentiments, and it was this fervour that crept over the denominational lines through informal contacts and into the more politically powerful mainline churches.
The imposition of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953 brought some of theses issues to a head. In Zambia it was felt that the Federation exacerbate the issues of racial inequality and economically favoured Zimbabwe over Zambia and Malawi. The Christian Council of Northern Rhodesia, that had replaced the General Missionary Conference in 1944, stated its position clearly when it wrote:
"Under normal circumstances the Church is bound to support the State and the forces aimed as preserving law and order, but this obligation is qualified by the Church's higher loyalty to the law of God. Where the State is misusing its Stewardship of power; where it is not adequately fulfilling its function of protecting the God-given freedom of all its citizens; where it is favouring one section of the community to the detriment of the others, then a Christian is called to protest ad to take whatever action is compatible with the Christian Gospel."
The imposition of the Federation was a response by Britain to shore up an empire it could no longer maintain after the war. In its attempts to preserve its power the colonial government alienated the churches as some of the most powerful civil society groups in the nation, prompting open opposition to its policies. It would not be long before this rift allied with an educated Zambian elite would bring about calls for Zambian independence. It was a lesson that would not be lost on future governments.
Independence.
The drive for an independent Zambia found a secure home in the churches. "The Christian Church… formed a crucial part of the associational landscape in many Sub-Saharan countries, consisting not only of a forum for spiritual communication but also a sanctuary for secular resistance." Phiri noted that "the mission centres provided a place where the contradictions between Christianity and the politics of racism and colonialism could be discussed in relative freedom… The effect of this was that the anti-colonial struggle in Zambia was clearly driven by Christian beliefs and packaged in Christian social action."
The Lumpa Church was established in 1954 by Alice Lenshina, from a village near Lubwa Mission in Chinsali District of Northern Province of Zambia. It quickly spread to the whole of Northern Province, Eastern Province and the Copperbelt, was an AIC. It staid aloof of the nationalist struggle against the colonial rule. This led to the accusation that the Church was actually opposing the struggle as recently had been initiated by the ANC and later UNIP. The main aim of the Lumpa Church was to clean the country of witchcraft. This message was very popular. She helped also to reintegrate widows who could get important positions in her church, for example as prayer leaders or as church choir leaders. . Lenshina's movement had specifically spiritual roots, she was "a peasant woman who claimed to have died and risen again." Encouraged by Fergus Macpherson, the Scottish missionary of Lubwa Mission to share her story she gathered a large following and formed an independent church.
The rapid rise of the Lumpa church and its reluctance to involve itself with anti-colonial struggle led to violent conflicts with the UNIP youth in Chinsali District and then later also with colonial authorities. In 1963 the new majority government with Kenneth Kaunda as prime minister send the army into the district to restore order and to capture Lenshina. Sporadic clashes became an open war, in which the official death toll was 1,111, although it was probably much larger Lenshina surrendered herself to the army and was sentenced to life imprisonment. The Lumpa Church was banned. Tens of thousands of her followers fled to the Congo. The Church only reappeared after the fall of Kaunda in 1988.
Much of the latter conflict with the Lumpa Church had been undertaken by the transitional government formed to take over from the colonial administration in 1964. This transitional government was led by Kenneth Kaunda. Kaunda was himself a product of the mission schools, as was his father, David, who was "a well-educated Malawian preacher and schoolteacher… who moved to Zambia as a missionary." Kaunda would emphasize his Christian roots, especially in the lead up to independence and in the early years of his presidency. "I was brought up in a Christian home and my Christian belief is part of me now. It is still my habit to turn to God in prayer asking for his guidance." His Christian beliefs ensured the colonial administration were favourably disposed towards Kaunda and the United National Independence Party (UNIP) that he led. His faith also bought him wide support in the churches both African and European led. However, Kaunda also emphasised that it was his understanding of the Bible's teachings that led him to conclude that colonialism "was immoral because it denied Africans their God-given dignity".
Though the church was the seedbed for much of the nationalism that brought about independence in Zambia, Phiri notes that the freedoms that nationalism wrought were to allow other secular civil society associations to ease the church aside as the main source of opposition to colonial rule. With Kaunda's declarations of faith and independence the church retracted from the political sphere, merely lending support to the government policies when necessary. Phiri maintains that this demonstrates the reverse of the phenomenon that Bayart observed in Cameroon in which "churches often replace the manifestly political institutions in certain of their functions. When civil society is repressed by a predatory state, a vacuum occurs in the political system." Phiri indicates that the relative freedoms of political association and the improved public spending initiatives of the early years of UNIP rule caused the Church to return to a more traditional pastoral role. Others, such as Gifford, suggest that Bayart's observations are too generalised and were specific in geographical and chronological reference only to Cameroon at the time Bayart made them. Therefore, it is difficult to translate these interpretations either to newly independent Zambia or even to the present day circumstances.
In 1972 the political freedoms declined markedly and this was rapidly followed by economic volatility as well. In response to, Simon Kapwepwe, the former Vice-President's attempt to form an alternative political party to UNIP Kaunda's government declared Zambia a one party state. The following year Zimbabwe closed its borders to "all Zambian exports, except copper, which adversely affected the economy". Exports were diverted through Tanzania and Angola, but in 1974 the outbreak of civil war in Angola was to have a further impact on the Zambian economy. At this time the price of copper, accounting for 95% of Zambia's export earnings, began to fall dramatically. By 1976 Kaunda was forced to declare a state of emergency and the dramatic dip in revenue caused the UNIP government to borrow heavily, significantly increasing Zambia's external debt. The worsening economic situation and increasing debt led the IMF to intervene in the 1980s to shore up the economy and impose Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) on Zambia. Kaunda only survived politically with the return and reconciliation with Kapwepwe in 1978.
During this period there was also a shift in the power and politics in Zambian ecclesiastical life. The churches began to assemble around three representative bodies: The Episcopal Conference of Zambia (ECZ), the Christian Council of Zambia (CCZ) and the Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia (EFZ). The ECZ was a unified voice for the component elements of the Roman Catholic Church; the CCZ was largely the traditional Protestant mission churches, the UCZ, the Anglicans etc. and the EFZ was started by the Baptists as a more Evangelical body, but as the years have passed has become increasingly Pentecostal. Following independence the colonial mission churches came under pressure from two fronts. The first was a growth in AICs that "split off from mission churches, usually because of perceived racism, or… to incorporate local elements that the mission churches would not countenance." The second came from the influx of missionaries, especially from the United States, who were sent by Pentecostal and Charismatic churches. The emphasis on the miraculous and an acknowledgement of the impact of the spiritual realm on the physical world had a great impact in Africa, where "the traditional culture of African society… draws little distinction between the spiritual and the temporal." The growth in the AICs in particular and probably the memory of the Lumpa uprising caused Kaunda to impose "a ban on the registration of new churches", in 1988 to "stem what he considered to be an 'unprecedented establishment of breakaway churches'". This move though was indicative of a widening gap between the church and state in regards to the economic policies, political ideologies and personal life of Kaunda.
During the late 1960s the UNIP government embarked on a more radical socialist agenda which became known as Scientific Socialism. This move alarmed the wider Christian community of Zambia fearing that it could lead to Marxist Humanism in the nation. The ECZ, CCZ and EFZ took the unusual step of issuing "a joint statement entitled Marxism, Humanism and Christianity". The government fearing a backlash from the public toned down its policies. Phiri comments on this episode, "the churches discerned that the UNIP was adopting socialism not necessarily because of an ideological change of heart, but as another method of control." The success of the combined pressure prompted the three bodies to continue to work closely in terms of public policy, which Gifford goes on to note "makes Zambian Christianity… virtually unique on the continent" in that "the co-operation includes Pentecostals."
The ideological tensions rose again when Kaunda identified his personal political philosophy as "Zambian Humanism". To Kaunda it was the coming together of his Christian ethics and the values of traditional African society. However, Kaunda's newly expounded philosophical outlook ran headlong into the theological outlook of the churches of the EFZ that were being heavily influenced by the new missionary movement from the United States. Gifford notes that Kaunda's "idealistic and utopian combination" endured the anger of the EFZ influenced by "American Evangelism whom the word "humanism" carried the worst of connotations", Colin Morris, an English Methodist missionary in Zambia who was a friend and strong supporter of Kaunda, described Kaunda's beliefs as syncretistic: "he can make himself a cathedral, mosque, temple or synagogue with an ease that makes nonsense of religious divisions." By now Kaunda had lost the trust of the churches who regarded him as a "renegade Christian presiding over a corrupt and oppressive government". The churches refused to co-operate with the 1976 education reforms believing that because of socialism, "government's educational ideology was atheistic".
The harshness of the SAPs was to cause serious food riots in Zambia during the last years of the UNIP government when subsidies on staples, such as maize meal, were removed. Kaunda was often forced to back-pedal and reinstate the subsidies. In doing so the UNIP government incurred the wrath of the IMF who blacklisted Zambia on the international financial markets, so furthering its poverty. With the halcyon days of post-independence free education and health now in the past the poor in particular needed to look elsewhere for help. Shao says, "when a government is unable to build a clinic in a village, the people's tendency is to look to the church for help." the same was true in Zambia at this period. With the waning of Kaunda's star the power of churches was in the ascendancy again and any serious challenger to Kenneth Kaunda would need to show indisputable Christian credentials.
The Church and the Christian Nation.
The political unrest in Zambia, including food riots in which 30 people died and an attempted coup, resulted in a call for multi-party democracy. "The demand for Democracy in many countries in Africa, including Zambia, was also an expression of opposition to the effects of structural adjustment." The beleaguered Kaunda capitulated and called a referendum. In mid 1990, "The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), an unofficial alliance of political opponents of the Government, was formed" under the leadership of the recently ousted Finance Minister Arthur Wina and the leader of the Zambian trade unions, Frederick Chiluba, to fight the democratic corner in the referendum. Kaunda then postponed the referendum by a year, but by then the momentum was too strong even in his own party. By the end of 1990 Kaunda announced that multi-party elections would be held in October 1991. The "MMD chose not to disband into many small parties that could easily be defeated by the UNIP. Instead the MMD registered as one party and elected the popular trade unionist Fredrick Chiluba as its presidential candidate."
Though the churches steered a careful course so as not to actively promote any party Phiri notes that "pro-democracy political sermons became frequent in many churches," but concludes, "despite their bias towards change, the Churches commendably maintained a non-partisan role, emerging as critical agents of reconciliation during critical times." Churches were to hold days of prayer for the election process, including election night itself, and, "in the few months before the elections, the churches made probably their greatest contribution to a peaceful transition. They joined to form the Christian Churches Monitoring Group, which then became the Zambia Elections Monitoring Coordinating Committee (ZEMEC), which set out to train a grassroots army to observe procedures at all polling stations on election day." Jimmy Carter who led the international team of observers notes that at a time of "political impasse", between Chiluba and Kaunda the Anglican Cathedral in Lusaka provided the "acceptable meeting place for both parties. Their meeting, which began with shared prayer, resulted eventually in a redrafting of the constitution that opened the way for the elections." Chiluba later credited Carter as being sent from God.
Christians wary of Kaunda's somewhat unorthodox theological positions in the past were further antagonised when the President began openly flirting with Eastern Religious beliefs. The growing perception in Zambia was "that Kaunda had not just forsaken true Christianity, but had fallen under the sway of Eastern gurus… in the 1980s he became linked with a Dr M. A. Ranganathan and established his David Universal Temple at State House." Phiri states that the association with "Eastern Religions… was not acceptable to Zambian Christians." The tensions caused by the perceived drift of Kaunda from Christian orthodoxy were exacerbated when Kaunda alleged "churches were preaching hatred" in response to negative articles about his regime in two Christian publications. Possibly in an attempt to antagonise the churches even more Kaunda joined with a television project with the Marharishi Mahesh Yogi launching a scheme to make Zambia "Heaven on Earth"" Kaunda was forced in a television interview to deny practising Transcendental Meditation., this was televised on the state-run channel days before polling. Gifford notes that the response by senior pastors from Ndola, the principal town of the Copperbelt, was to call the project "demonic" and they "deplored the fact that the government 'had banned the registration of more churches but permitted occult systems to enter Zambia'".
Smith observes that Fredrick Chiluba "was situated quite differently than Kaunda – politically and religiously speaking. Politically speaking he symbolised a new generation." not caught up in the dogma of the colonialism verses nationalism debate of Kaunda, but representing the developmental needs of Zambia. In the run up to the elections Chiluba was to use the rift between Kaunda and Christians to his advantage by emphasising his Christianity. He "stressed (and his supporters stressed even more) his impeccable credentials as a true spirit-filled believer. Christian motifs were introduced into the political struggle – the diminutive Chiluba being frequently referred to as David challenging Goliath, and even more frequently as Moses, about to bring his people to freedom after almost forty years of fruitless wanderings in the wilderness." Phiri states that "Chiluba gained the support of the churches Kaunda simultaneously lost his."
At the election on 31 October 1991, Fredrick Chiluba "received 75.79% of the votes cast" and the MMD won 125 of the 150 seats in the national assembly in elections that, "international observers reported… had been conducted fairly". Haynes states that this was "brought about in part due to the perception that the previous government under K. Kaunda threatened the Church". Though opposition to SAPs had led to the elections the candidate's personalities their religious beliefs might have masked the economic concerns. Simutanyi notes that "during the election campaign the question of the economy was not given serious attention." The excitement elicited among ordinary Zambians at the opportunity to elect a party of their choice enabled the "erstwhile opponents of structural adjustment" to change political horses midstream and present their rendering of SAPs "as a panacea for Zambia' s economic problems… ordinary people showed open support for austerity. For example, at an MMD rally addressed by Chiluba in Kabwe in August 1990, Chiluba asked his audience if they would be prepared for sacrifices when the MMD came to power. They chanted 'YES.'" Of course, by embracing SAPs Chiluba and the MMD also ensured that they would be viewed favourably by the IMF and international finance community should they gain power.
Chiluba quotes a conversation he had with Jimmy Carter just before the election, "he says 'what you say today will matter tomorrow, you have to be very mindful every word you utter should have meaning.'" These words would come back to haunt Chiluba as his presidency unfolded. Two months after the election Chiluba called for a "celebration of praise", at State House at which he declared on national television that Zambia was a Christian nation. Phiri speculates that Chiluba's declaration was a personal commitment to God as president that he would lead Zambia guided by his principles based on his Christian faith. "One of my informants, Melu, felt that, as far as the president was concerned, the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation was not a political statement… it was some thing he believed he needed to do." Phiri had previously stated that Chiluba "often draws little distinction between his personal religious faith and his public role as president". Gifford on the other hand sees the declaration as a chance by the Pentecostal and Evangelical Churches to gain an upper hand in politics in Zambia. "Following the announcement, there was general euphoria on the past of many born-agains." The ECZ and CCZ response was muted as they had not been consulted before the declaration. Gifford suggests, "Chiluba may have contacted officials of the EFZ, who no doubt were reluctant to bring in the other bodies because they saw this as their hour, having in the past felt themselves slightly overshadowed by the ECZ and CCZ."
Chiluba's patronage of the Evangelical wing of the church continued as he "appointed born-again pastors to government posts". "Chiluba was reported to have distributed 140 million kwacha to some of these churches during the 1996 election campaign in the hope of solidifying their political support. Chiluba has offered other perks to churches towards this end as well, including issuing diplomatic passports to clergy… and allocating building plots to churches." He and Godfrey Miyanda, who began as Minister without Portfolio and later became Vice President, could be "found 'preaching' to church constituencies at mass rallies, church fund-raising events and Sunday church services", though Gifford notes of this latter practice "in Zambia, it would be hard for a President to do otherwise." Phiri also noted that "there was an influx of Christian missionaries into Zambia. New charismatic churches or church organisations increased." This is hardly surprising as the Pentecostal church in particular was keen to promote Chiluba's Christian nation. A video produced by Christian Vision talks of Chiluba in terms similar to the account of Joseph in Genesis saying, "this man who only a decade ago languished in a Zambian gaol has found God, found freedom, found the support of his people and has been voted president of his country by a massive majority. Shattering the chains of economic stagnation, of increasing poverty and spiritual darkness", and aimed to encourage Western Christians to invest money and skills into Zambia based on its status as a Christian nation.
It is clear that the motives for Chiluba's declaration are somewhat ambiguous. On one hand Chiluba was calling on God for divine blessing on Zambia at the declaration he quoted 2 Chron 7:14 saying "If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn form their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and forgive their sin and will heal their land", and as Phiri speculates, "one of the reasons why Zambia was declared a Christian nation was Chiluba's belief that a nation whose leader fears God prospers economically. This interpretation of he Bible is heavily influenced by the US faith prosperity teachings that were gaining influence in Zambia, through missionaries, overseas contacts and increasingly by the means of mass media. "American sources and missionaries are systematically flooding the continent and forming a crucial, dynamic part of the African revival." Gifford comments, "the faith paradigm has become widely accepted as Christianity, and is staple fare on Zambian television."
Chiluba had an understanding of how Pentecostal churches view his presidency as God appointed. Rev. Sky Banda as senior Pentecostal pastor in the nation says of Chiluba, "when he finally got into the presidentship position we were very happy. We felt it was a God-ordained situation." Haynes proposes, "independent churches… theologically towards the conservative end of the religious spectrum, regarded government as divinely sanctioned, that they rule because God allows them to." By using scriptures such as Romans 13:1a, "Everyone must summit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." Chiluba was confident he would be able to push his harsh economic polices through with little opposition from the Pentecostal wing of the church. An even more powerful inference in Pentecostal terms was that his presidency was like that of an Old Testament king. Using a scripture, "the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord", 1 Sam 24:5, often appropriated by Pentecostal faith prosperity teachers to hide excesses in their ministry and prevent serious investigation, he and his supporters were able to fend off difficult questions from Pentecostal quarters, see also.
With this seemingly sound scriptural backing Chiluba was able to ask of his Christian supporters to endure hardships beyond those that brought the UNIP government of Kaunda to its knees. Calling once more on faith prosperity doctrines, "Chiluba admonished Christians to 'work hard and not to continue begging because there was not poverty in heaven'." Phiri questioned whether Chiluba's actions were in fact in keeping with his former beliefs as a trade unionist, "the characteristics of liberal democracy as understood by Chiluba were not put into practice when he declared Zambia a Christian nation." Because of his seemingly unassailable position the MMD threw themselves whole heartedly into an adjustment programme. Haynes comments that the programme "was so stringent that the local World Bank representative counselled caution and urged that greater concern be given to the issue of social instability, which he judged to be a direct result of too fervent an application of adjustment policies". The policy left many unemployed, raise the price of basic foods with the removal of subsidies (an action that had caused major riots under Kaunda) and increased the cost of education and healthcare. The application of this programme was to have a huge impact on the population and it was to finally cause a rift between Chiluba and the church. Phiri states it, "contributed to the worsening of the economic standards of 80 percent of Zambians". Once more as hardship threatened the population the church was compelled to take up an advocacy role instigating, "conflict between Chiluba and the churches… to the social impact of his economic policies" This was a crucial moment in the relationship between Chiluba and the church because, "the sustainability of economic policies depends to a large extent of the balance of power between groups supporting and those against."
The surprise declaration of the Christian nation had already alienated the CCZ and ECZ and they became increasing less likely to fully support Chiluba just because he was a Christian. The declaration eventually estranged many of the women of Zambia, who had enthusiastically supported Chiluba in 1991, but later felt that he was "not gender sensitive and… wonderwhether this had anything to do with the fact that Zambia… [had been declared a Christian nation." Illustrating what Aboum suggests, "the relationship between the church and Women is contradictory. On the one had, the Church empowers women, and on the other, it has been slow in applying the revolutionary message of good news for women within its own structures." Put simply, "the Church has an empowering role, but a marginalising structure." As the economic hardships increased churches came under greater pressure both to provide welfare, but also because of financial hardships within their own organisations. "As Africa's economies have collapsed, many African churches have been reduced to a state of penury." Indeed Zambia itself became increasingly reliant on outside AID. Though Christian nation status ensured that Christians in the west would be encouraged to donate more to see Zambia succeed, Zambia's poverty and debt burden increased dramatically during the 1990s. Chiluba's policies were causing the churches to distance themselves from him. "In March 1992 EFZ… issued a statement in which it appealed to the Zambian church to 'restrict itself to those matters that are within its competence' and to 'maintain a reasonable distance form government'."
By 1996 the term Christian nation had been written into the opening of the proposed Zambian constitution. This took the debate from whether the declaration in 1991 was a personal statement or policy to a new level. As Phiri says it now, "had legal implications or a longer lasting nature than the Chiluba presidency." There were demands from opposition MPs and even a joint communiqué from the ECZ, CCZ and even the EFZ calling for a referendum, but, "Chiluba simply offered the constitution to Parliament to approve", and his confidence was rewarded when the MMD MPs holding a vast majority approved the wording. These actions along with others by Chiluba, including attempting to prevent Kaunda from running for president again, caused UNIP to boycott the forthcoming presidential elections.
Chiluba's perceived arrogance coupled with his failures to tackle the economic decline, poverty or corruption caused some pastors to conclude that what was lacking was suitably informed and educated Christians in politics to see the vision of a Christian nation through to its conclusion. Nevers Mumba, a Pentecostal pastor, and a key supporter of Chiluba in 1991 formed the National Christian's Coalition in 1996. Mumba claimed that this was not a political party, but just an organisation to "act as an independent voice in guiding the president in matters of concern to the church". However this caused great controversy among Christians, some of whom thought Mumba was in fact harbouring political ambitions to become president himself. Mumba challenged the integrity of Chiluba's government and in doing so caused Chiluba to see the NCC as a threat to his power. Under increasing pressure from within the NCC and increasing alienation by other political groups and churches Mumba converted the NCC into a political party and stood at the 1996 elections. The NCC however failed to win a seat. Chiluba was returned by 70% of the vote, but only 40% of the registered electorate turned out and only 60% of eligible electors had ever been registered. The absence of UNIP and voting irregularities caused many, including international observers, to question the validity of the election.
In his second term Chiluba continued to lose the confidence of the people of Zambia. In 1997 an attempted coup triggered the arrest of UNIP activists and the house arrest of Kenneth Kaunda. This brought down international condemnation on Chiluba. His separation from his wife Vera in 2000 caused many in church circles to question whether Chiluba's faith was what it once had been. And when Chiluba's demanded to stay on for a third term, despite the fact that it contradicted the constitution he had fought so hard to push through, it diminished his standing even further. In 1991, "Chiluba… promised the Christian community that power… not corrupt his character", but this had an increasingly hollow ring to it. Gifford comments the make up of the MMD included a large number of Kaunda's regime who had jumped ship to keep their lucrative positions. "In 1994, Vice-President Levy Mwanamasa resigned, alleging Chiluba's government was corrupt." When opposed over his demand for a third term, "Chiluba reacted undemocratically by expelling twenty-two senior members of the MMD party, including Miyanda." On 3 May 2001 an attempt to impeach Chiluba was made to the Zambian parliament and backed by 158 MPs. The next day Chiluba, "announced 'I will leave office at the end of my term. Let's take national interests into consideration, this is in the best interest of the nation'… his presidency of Zambia as a Christian Nation ended with his reputation both as a Christian and as a democrat in ruins." He handed over power to the newly elected president Levy Mwanamasa, the leader of the MMD, in December 2001. In his first address to the Nation, the new president reaffirmed his commitment to the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation.
Pentecostal churches have managed to distance themselves to such a degree they were largely unaffected by Chiluba's fall. The instigation of the NCC by Mumba provided many with a safe method of switching allegiances without abandoning the concept of the Christian nation. Phiri says of Zambian political affairs that it, "has not fallen into the pattern of one party that supports the Christian Nation, contesting with another party which opposes it. Zambian politics has come increasingly to be played out between supporters of the Christian Nation." Following Mwanamasa's election he called on Nevers Mumba to become Vice President and in doing so conferred Pentecostal legitimacy on his government without the baggage that surrounded Chiluba. In many ways the Chiluba presidency has enabled the Pentecostal church to secure its voice in with the larger and more established churches in Zambia and among the urban populations in particular it is increasingly seen as one of the most active parts of civil society.

Trisul

Trisul () is a group of three Himalayan mountain peaks of western Kumaun, with the highest (Trisul I) reaching 7120m. The three peaks resemble a trident - in Hindi/Sanskrit, Trishula, trident, is the weapon of Shiva. The Trishul group forms the southeast corner of the ring of peaks enclosing the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, about west-southwest of Nanda Devi itself. The main peak, Trisul I, was the first peak over to have ever been climbed, in 1907.
Description of the massif and neighboring peaks.
The three peaks are named Trisul I, Trisul II, and Trisul III. The massif is a north-south ridge, with Trisul I at the north end and Trisul III at the south. The massif runs roughly North-South, and hence appears compressed when viewed from the south (Ranikhet, Kausani), and more stretched out from the Southeast (Chamoli, Bedini Bugyal).
Nanda Ghunti lies a few kilometers to the northwest, while Mrigthuni is just to the southeast. 
Climbing history.
Trisul I.
T. G. Longstaff made the first climbing reconnaissance of Trisul, in September 1905, focussing on the western and southern sides. He returned in 1907 with two other Britons, three Alpine guides, and a number of Gurkhas. They ascended through the Rishiganga valley, to the north of the peak, onto the Trisul Glacier, which lies on the east side. From there they climbed the northeast flank to the north ridge, reaching the summit on June 12. At the time Trisul was probably the highest mountain to have been climbed.
The climb was noted also for the first use of supplementary oxygen in a major climb
Routes on the west face and south ridge of Trisul I have also been climbed. The west face was first ascended in 1976; this was the first ascent of the main summit not using the first-ascent route.
Trisul II and III.
Trisul II and Trisul III were first climbed in 1960 by the Yugoslav team . They climbed from the Bidalgwar glacier, achieving the summit of Trisul II via the southern ridge and Trisul III via the north ridge.
Another Yugoslav expedition made the first traverse of the three peaks in 1987, and two members paraglided from the summit.
Trivia.
Aleš Kunaver was a member of the first Yugoslav team which climbed Trisul in 1960. In 1987, his daughter Vlasta Kunaver climbed Trisul I and was one of the paragliders.
Access.
The Trisul massif can be accessed via the following route: Almora - Kausani - Garur- Gwaldam - Debal - Bagargad - Wan - Bedini Bugyal - Kelva Vinayak - Roopkund - Trisul.

II Tone Committee

II Tone Committee a.k.a Tones of Twice, composed of Mistah Bohze, Defy, Sace and DJ Krash Slaughta and emerged from the Glasgow Hip Hop scene of the late 80’s
History.
The Group hailing from Glasgow's southside were pervayors of the early British hip hop sound, labeled by some as Britcore. Along with other britcore groups such as Gunshot, Hijack, London Posse, Demon Boyz, Katch 22, Silver Bullet, Hardnoise and Killa Instinct, the groups manages to created a sound and identity which gave rise to the UK hip hop scene, something the UK had struggled with ever since hip hop first arrived. 
Although acclaimed by critics and fellow artists, and despite selling over 30,000 copies of their EP and compilation releases, the Glasgow band were better known in mainland Europe than they were at home in the UK.
In recently years Mistah Bohze, alongside fellow Woodchoppas Dojo artists Chuck and NC Epik, has produced two albums with his new group The Sentinalez. DJ Krash Slaughta currently splits his time between DJing and producing new material, playing alongside west coast of Scotland based group All Time High who featured on DJ Numark’s mix cd ‘Hands On’. Mista Defy is working on various projects. There is still hope within the scene that the group will reform, although as yet there is no sign of it happening.

Congenital hearing loss

Congenital hearing loss is a hearing loss present at birth. It can include hereditary hearing loss or hearing loss due to other factors present either in-utero (prenatal) or at the time of birth.
Genetic factors.
Genetic factors are thought to cause more than 50% of all incidents of congenital hearing loss. Genetic hearing loss may be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked (related to the sex chromosome).
Hearing loss.
Autosomal dominant hearing loss.
In autosomal dominant hearing loss, one parent who carries the dominant gene for hearing loss and typically has a hearing loss passes it on to the child. In this case there is at least a 50% probability that the child will also have a hearing loss. The probability is higher if both parents have the dominant gene (and typically both have a hearing loss) or if both grandparents on one side of the family have hearing loss due to genetic causes. Because at least one parent usually has a hearing loss, there is prior expectation that the child may have a hearing loss.
Autosomal recessive hearing loss.
In autosomal recessive hearing loss, both parents who typically have normal hearing, carry a recessive gene. In this case the probability of the child having a hearing loss is 25%. Because both parents usually have normal hearing, and because no other family members have hearing loss, there is no prior expectation that the child may have a hearing loss.
X-linked hearing loss.
In X-linked hearing loss, the mother carries the recessive trait for hearing loss on the sex chromosome. She can pass on the trait to males and female children, but usually only male children are affected.
There are some genetic syndromes, in which hearing loss is one of the known characteristics. Some examples are Down syndrome (abnormality on a gene), Usher syndrome (autosomal recessive), Treacher Collins syndrome (autosomal dominant), Crouzon syndrome (autosomal dominant), and Alport syndrome (X-linked).
Other causes of congenital hearing loss.
Other causes of congenital hearing loss is that are not hereditary in nature include prenatal infections, illnesses, toxins consumed by the mother during pregnancy or other conditions occurring at the time of birth or shortly thereafter. These conditions typically cause sensorineural hearing loss ranging from mild to profound in degree. Examples include:
Treatment.
A child with a congenital hearing loss should begin receiving treatment before 6 months of age. Studies suggest that children treated this early are usually able to develop communication skills (using spoken or sign language) that are as good as those of hearing peers.
In the United States of America, because of a Federal law (the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), children with a hearing loss between birth and 3 years of age have the right to receive interdisciplinary assessment and early intervention services at little or no cost. After age 3, early intervention and special education programs are provided through the public school system.
There are a number of treatment options available, and parents will need to decide which are most appropriate for their child. They will need to consider the child’s age, developmental level and personality, the severity of the hearing loss, as well as their own preferences. Ideally a team of experts including the child’s primary care provider, an otolaryngologist, a speech-language pathologist, audiologist and an educator will work closely with the parents to create an Individualized Family Service Plan. Treatment plans can be changed as the child gets older.
Children as young as 4 weeks of age can benefit from a hearing aid. These devices amplify sound, making it possible for many children to hear spoken words and develop language. However, some children with severe to profound hearing loss may not be able to hear enough sound, even with a hearing aid, to make speech audible. A behind-the-ear hearing aid is often recommended for young children because it is safer and more easily fitted and adjusted as the child grows as compared to one that fits within the ear.
Parents also will need to decide how their family and child are going to communicate. If the child is going to communicate orally (speech), s/he may need assistance learning listening skills and lip reading skills to help her/him understand what others are saying. Many children with hearing loss also need speech or language therapy.
A child also can learn to communicate using a form of sign language. In the United States of America, the type preferred by most deaf adults is American Sign Language (ASL), which has rules and grammar that is distinct from English. There are also several variations of sign language that can be used along with spoken English which are standard in English-speaking countries outside the United States.
Surgery may be recommended if a child has a permanent conductive hearing loss caused by malformations of the outer or middle ear, or by repeated ear infections. Although fluid in the middle ear usually results in only temporary hearing loss, chronic ear infection can cause a child to fall behind in language skills. In some cases, a doctor may suggest inserting a tube through the eardrum to allow the middle ear to drain. This procedure generally does not require an overnight hospital stay.
Surgery also may be an option for some children with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. A device called a cochlear implant can be surgically inserted in the inner ear of children as young as 12 months of age to stimulate hearing. The surgery requires a hospital stay of one to several days. With additional language and speech therapy, children with cochlear implants may learn to understand speech and speak reasonably well, but the amount of improvement is variable.
Once a child is diagnosed, the immediate and anticipated reaction of the parents and immediate family is one of the denial. Doctors or the audiologists need to counsel the family, help them cope with the situation and encourage them to look forward to solutions to overcome the problem. Often when the family is told about the excellent options available for a hearing impaired child, the chances of acceptance are much better. Once the family accepts the handicap, half the battle is over and rehabilitation can begin.
The type of intervention required depends on several factors. Chief among these is the degree of impairment. When a child has a fair degree of residual hearing, the correct intervention would be fitting "optimised" hearing aids. "Optimisation" means fitting the child with a hearing aid appropriate to its degree of deafness.
Today a variety of good quality hearing aids are available – analog or digital body worn (for small children) or ear level for older children. When fitting a hearing aid, a competent audiologist has to assess the child's residual hearing, look at the hearing aid's performance and fit the child with an appropriate instrument. Equally important is the ear mould, which has to be custom made to suit the shape of the child's ear.
If a child has profound or even total deafness, it has very little or virtually no residual hearing. In such a case hearing aids do not make scientific sense. Such a child needs a different kind of treatment called Cochlear Implants which are a sets of electrodes implanted surgically into the inner ear.

Ornithoptera meridionalis

The Southern Tailed Birdwing ("Ornithoptera meridionalis") is the smallest species of the genus "Ornithoptera". It is known from a handful of localities in southeast Papua, New Guinea ("O. meridionalis meridionalis") and several localities along the south coast of Irian Jaya ("O. meridionalis tarunggarensis"). 
The specific ephiphet "meridionalis", means southern.
History.
"O. meridionalis" was first collected by Albert Stewart Meek near Samarai, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea. The holotype is a female held in the British Museum (Natural History) collection. Meek was funded in his expeditions by the scientific author of this species, Lord Walter Rothschild.
Distribution and habitat.
It is strictly a lowland species, favouring primary rainforest. A very few specimens have also been collected at altitude in Irian Jaya by Jan Pasternak, however these specimens were reared from immature stages and emerged crippled (Deslisle, 2004), suggesting that high altitude forests are not favoured habitats. "O. meridionalis" has also recently been found in close promimity to its sister species, "Ornithoptera paradisea", near Timika in Irian Jaya (Gotts, 2003). Host plants for this species are all vines of the genus "Pararistolochia" (Aristolochiaceae), including the species "P. meridionalis" in Papua New Guinea. Larvae typically ringbark the host before pupating on nearby plants.
"O. meridionalis" is classified as Vulnerable in the ‘Red Data Book of Threatened Swallowtail Butterflies of the World’ and is threatened by habitat loss (rainforest clearing), especially in parts of Papua New Guinea. For example, a well known locality at the Brown River has now been destroyed by logging. There are a few villages farming this species in Papua New Guinea. Most commercially available specimens are now sourced from Irian Jaya and are extremely valuable (prices may exceed US$1000 per pair). Collecting has a negligible effect on population sizes provided the original habitat is left undisturbed.
Description.
Males of "O. meridionalis" are remarkable in that they have an extremely small amount of wing area relative to its rather bulky body. In particular, the hindwings are very reduced and tetragonal in shape, tapering into a single pair of filamentous tails that are easily broken. The only other tailed "Ornithoptera" is "Ornithoptera paradisea". Specimens of this sex are weak fliers and tend to spend most of the day resting. Females are more normally proportioned and have a flight characteristic more typical of the genus "Ornithoptera". Both sexes have been recorded feeding at flowers in numbers early in the morning.

"Female. The markings on the disc of both wings purer white, being less dusted over with black scales than in "Paradiseus Paradiseus". The patch in the cell of forewing is nearly straight at the basal side, its basal edge being very feebly
dentate, while at the apical side it bears one deep triangular notch. There are three discal patches.The light area of the hind wing is much extended, the apex of the cell bearing a large white patch which is obliquely cut off. The portion of the light area outside the diseal black spots is brighter yellow than in Paradiseus, and so is the upperside of the abdomen."

James W. Moseley

James Willett Moseley (August 4, 1931 – November 16, 2012) was an American observer, author, and commentator on the subject of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Over his career spanning nearly sixty years, he exposed UFO hoaxes and he engineered hoaxes of his own. He was best known as the publisher of the UFO newsletters "Saucer News" and its successor "Saucer Smear", which became the longest continuously published UFO journal in the world.
Biography.
Early life.
James Moseley was the son of U.S. Army Major General George Van Horn Moseley, chief of the 4th Section (supplies and evacuation) of General Pershing's Wartime General Staff, and Florence Barber Moseley (née DuBois) whose family owned the Barber Steamship Lines. His parents were married in July 1930, at which time his father was already 55 years old, and James was born the following year. His childhood was spent on army bases until his father's retirement in 1938.
James never got along with his father, taking particular exception to his outspoken racist and anti-semitic views, including his claims that America must "breed up" its own decaying population by copying Nazi eugenics practices, and launch a program of "selective breeding, sterilization, the elimination of the unfit, and the elimination of those types which are inimical to the general welfare of the nation."
1950s.
His mother died in December 1950, leaving the nineteen-year-old James the beneficiary of a large trust fund. Moseley inherited sufficient money to be able to pursue his own interests, and he never worked a conventional career. He left university, and spent much of his time initially traveling to South America to engage in what he called "grave robbing" of pre-Columbian artefacts, then later travelling to UFO conferences, interviewing UFO witnesses and personalities.
Moseley took up amateur archaeology and he made many trips to Peru, and to a lesser extent Ecuador and northern Chile, purchasing and digging up pre-Columbian antiquities. The distinction between archaeology and treasure hunting or grave-robbing was not always clear, and some of his activities may not be approved today. Even so, he made some significant finds and several of the mummies he found were placed in Peruvian museums by professional archaeologists. After Nazca Lines were first discovered by the Peruvian archaeologist Toribio Mejia Xesspe in 1927, Moseley was the first to suggest that there were intriguing Fortean phenomena in Fate Magazine, in October 1955, suggesting a mysterious origin, long before they interested alternative writers such as Erich von Däniken (1968), Henri Stierlin (1983) and Gerald Hawkins (1990). These South American trips indirectly led to his flying saucer involvement, when he agreed to collaborate on a book with Ken Krippene.
His interest in UFOs grew out of the incidents involving pilots Kenneth Arnold in 1947 and Thomas Mantell in 1948. His flying saucer career really began in 1953 when he drove across the country "tracking the elusive flying saucer" in preparation for his planned book. He interviewed almost 100 UFO experts and eyewitnesses: he visited the Pentagon and examined their files on UFO investigations; he visited the Project Blue Book facilities at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, meeting Col. Bob Friend; he interviewed the famous saucer author Major Donald E. Keyhoe, and felt that "Keyhoe routinely made too much out of too little, at least in part just to sell books"; he went to Mt. Palomar, California, where "Professor Adamski was holding court" in his hamburger stand; he met Gray Barker, who was to become his long-time friend and collaborator; he interviewed best-selling author Frank Scully; he attended the "Giant Rock" contactee convention and interviewed many witnesses, researchers and officials. He even met former President Harry S. Truman at his office in Independence, Missouri, and asked him about flying saucers. In what became one of Moseley’s favorite anecdotes, Truman responded jokingly, "I’ve never seen a purple cow, I never hope to see one."
When he returned from this trip, Moseley founded the organization S.A.U.C.E.R.S. (Saucers And Unexplained Celestial Events Research Society). The book with Ken Krippene never eventuated, but Moseley’s interest in UFOs deepened during his research and he also came to a realization. "I had discovered I wasn’t cut out to be a serious UFOlogist, unless of course one was to count the work I did exposing Adamski and, as time went on, certain other fakers and frauds."
In July, 1954, Moseley co-founded "Saucer News" (originally titled "Nexus"), a periodical known for its unorthodox, "freewheeling" style. Beyond the fake feuds (particularly with Gray Barker) and occasional hoaxes, "Saucer News" also featured serious research and reporting about UFOs, drawing heavily on the material he had gathered during his 1953 cross-country trip. Moseley was among the first to publicize evidence against George Adamski's claims of alien contact in number of issues, culminating in a special exposé issue of "Saucer News", and he reported his investigation into the Ralph Horton flying saucer crash, which he also conducted during the 1953 trip.
1960s.
Through the 1960s, Moseley became increasingly active among the UFO community, and his public profile grew. He gave many lectures about flying saucers, and even made several trips to Giant Rock in the California desert, a sort of Woodstock for UFO contactees and their followers. He was a semi-regular guest of Long John Nebel's radio show which dealt mainly with anomalous phenomena, UFOs, and other offbeat topics. After that, he moved on to become a regular guest of James Randi on "The Amazing Randi Show", also on New York radio station WOR. In later years, Moseley fell out with both men, referring to them as his enemies.
In 1966, there was a new wave of UFO publicity, kicked off by the incident in Michigan where Allen Hynek offered his "swamp gas" explanation which became famous. Moseley’s lecturing took off after this: the story was hot… "back in New York City, all the major national news organizations were rushing around trying to find an instant saucer expert to interview and quote. Mine was the only listing in the Manhattan phone book under "Saucers" (for "Saucer News"), so everyone came to me." To give his readers a sense of this activity, Moseley published his appearance schedule in "Saucer News": during the month of April 1967, for example, he delivered nine formal lectures at universities and colleges, and he gave another six media interviews. Around this time was also when he and Barker made the hoax Lost Creek saucer video.
Moseley attended the first large-scale gathering of the Congress of Scientific UFOlogists in Cleveland, Ohio in June of 1964, and he publicized it in his "Saucer News". After two more successful gatherings in Cleveland, Moseley decided to hold a really big convention in New York City in 1967. He arranged a wide range of well-known speakers, including Joe Franklin of WOR -TV, Gordon Evans, Art Ford, Frank Stranges, John Keel, Stewart Robb, Gray Barker, James Randi, Long John Nebel, Howard Menger, Ivan Sanderson, and Roy Thinnes, the star of the hit ABC-TV science fiction thriller "The Invaders". He secured the Grand Ballroom as well as the East Ballroom of the huge Hotel Commodore, right in the heart of Manhattan. Many UFO publications publicized the event, particularly since 1967 was the 20th anniversary of the Kenneth Arnold sighting. This "NYC Saucer Con" was a great success, with total attendance variously estimated from "well over a thousand" to six thousand people. In 1971, Moseley became Permanent Chairman of the National UFO Conference (NUFOC), whose main purpose was to organize and run an annual meeting or convention.
1970s.
Moseley sold "Saucer News" to his long-time friend Gray Barker in 1968. In 1970, he founded another newsletter that went by several titles until Moseley finally settled on "Saucer Smear". He produced the newsletter irregularly, but tried to keep a monthly schedule in later years. It became the longest continuously published UFO journal in the world.
Moseley never went online; he never owned a computer. He produced the print version of "Saucer Smear" on a regular portable electric typewriter. The publication was sent via mail to "non-subscribers," and he also authorized others to sell PDF issues and subscriptions from a website. It typically had a joking, gossipy tone and it covered not just UFO cases, but also examined the personalities of UFOlogists and it did not hesitate to poke fun at people if he thought they deserved it. When UFOlogists were feuding, as they often were, Moseley loved to run the vitriolic letters one would send in denouncing the other. The masthead on each issue proclaimed Moseley as the "Supreme Commander".
Many in the UFO community considered Moseley to be a sceptic because he was reluctant to accept many of the more famous incidents. But he was equally sceptical and sarcastic of the debunkers. Moseley reported that over the years he accepted, then rejected, a number of explanations for UFOs. In roughly chronological order, he considered the extraterrestrial hypothesis; a secret weapon/aircraft hypothesis, psychic/supernatural/interdimensional hypotheses in the vein of John Keel or Jacques Vallee; deep skepticism; and agnosticism. According to Jerome Clark, he "entertained just about every view it is possible to hold about UFOs," and according to Antonio Huneeus, "Moseley was critical and sarcastic regarding just about everything and everybody in UFOlogy. Yet Jim did believe a core of the UFO phenomenon was real and truly unexplained after filtering out all the hoaxes, conspiracy theories, misidentifications and just plain nonsense that pervades much of the field."
1980s and later.
In 1984, Moseley established an antiques store in Key West, Florida. There was a pre-Columbian art gallery, largely stocked with material he still had from his trips to South America in the 1950s. In 1992, Moseley donated his Peruvian collection to the Graves Museum of Archaeology and Natural History in Dania, Florida, where it is on permanent display.
Moseley co-wrote a memoir with Karl T. Pflock in 2002, entitled "Shockingly Close to the Truth! Confessions of a Grave-Robbing Ufologist", in which he recounted “the fun he has had over the years pursuing tall tales and purported evidence of visitors from outer space.” 
James Moseley died from cancer of the esophagus on November 16, 2012 at a hospital in Key West, Florida; he was 81 years old.
UFO investigations and hoaxes.
Exposé of George Adamski.
George Adamski was a teacher of the occult, who wrote a book in 1953 entitled "Flying Saucers Have Landed", which told the story of his encounter with an extraterrestrial named Orthon. The book made him a celebrity in flying saucer circles, and it inspired other people who became known as "contactees" to make similar claims. Adamski started to produce an abundance of apparent "evidence": multiple witnesses, physical traces, photographs and later he took movies of the saucer while he claimed to have ongoing contact with the visitors from space and share their message of peace and love with the people of Earth.
Moseley had interviewed Adamski in 1953, and while he found the “Professor” interesting and charismatic, he did not find the evidence convincing. He published several articles critically examining Adamski’s stories and photographs in issues of "Saucer News" magazine, and in October 1957 he published a "Special Adamski Exposé Issue" that collected articles written by Moseley, Irma Baker and Lonzo Dove to present a thorough analysis. The front cover showed how a "saucer photo" just like Adamski's could be made using a Chrysler hubcap, a coffee can, and ping pong balls. Jerrold Baker told how Adamski had provided him with fraudulent photos and suggested that "people would pay good money" if Baker claimed the photos were his own. The exposé included interviews and correspondence with Adamski’s supporting witnesses, some of whom said they had been mis-quoted, and others who turned out to be long-time associates of Adamski and who admitted that Adamski’s story and photographs had been falsified.
This was a watershed in the UFO field; it marked the first really serious analytical investigation into the evidence supporting a major claim. More than forty years later, the UFO historian Jerome Clark said "...the first serious investigation by a critic of Adamski’s claims was conducted by James W. Moseley in the mid-1950s and published as a special issue of his magazine "Saucer News" ... Moseley’s debunking of Adamski’s claims remains the definitive one".
Straith hoax letter.
Moseley was long suspected of having co-created a phony 1957 letter as a prank against self-claimed "alien contactee", George Adamski. After years of denying his involvement, evading the subject, and hinting at responsibility, Moseley admitted to the hoax in 1985.
Adamski had become well-known following publication of his 1953 book "Flying Saucers Have Landed", and subsequent paraphernalia "evidence". Moseley published a damning exposé in "Saucer News" magazine. Just as word of Adamski's fakery was spreading, a letter of support came from an unlikely source.
In 1957, Gray Barker acquired some blank U.S. Governmental official letterhead and envelopes from a friendwhite-seal, blue-embossed paper, with the American eagle watermark and the Seal of State impressed. During an evening "emboldened by the evil of alcohol", Moseley and Barker wrote seven prank letters using this official stationery. Five of the letters were jokes to friends, and two were outright hoaxes: the Adamski letter and one to Moseley's own father, which was never mailed, that "objected to his having indulged in extreme right-wing political activities while on a military pension, strongly implying he might lose the latter if he did not refrain from the former”.
The letter to Adamski was signed by the fictional "R.E. Straith", a representative of the non-existent "Cultural Exchange Committee" of the U.S. State Department. Straith wrote that the government knew that Adamski had actually spoken to extraterrestrials in a California desert in 1952, and that the department also had its own evidence bearing out his claims. It encouraged him to continue his work of communicating his experiences to the public, since the government could not take an official position on the matter.
Adamski took great pride in the Straith letter. He publicized its contents, and UFO proponents all over the world used it to validate their claims. When FBI agents investigated it, they informed Adamski that the Straith letter was a hoax and asked him to stop using it as evidence in support of his claims, but Adamski refused and he continued to display the letter in his lectures and talks. FBI agents also questioned Barker about the matter, but no criminal charges were filed.
Many investigators tried to confirm or debunk the letter, without any categorical outcomes. 
Barker himself described it as "one of the great unsolved mysteries of the UFO field" in his 1967 "Book of Adamski".
As late as 1983, researchers Timothy Good and Lou Zinsstag concluded that "much of the evidence is circumstantial, but on balance there is more in favour of the letter being genuine."
On December 6, 1984, Gray Barker died. The next month, Jim Moseley revealed the truth in "Saucer Smear" on January 10, 1985.
Moseley has admitted to multiple UFO "hoaxes", and is suspected in many more, but the Straith hoax appears to be the one most remembered by both his fans and his detractors.
Ralph Horton crash case.
Moseley investigated the Ralph Horton flying saucer crash after finding it in the flying saucer file of the "Atlanta Constitution". Moseley called the airport and confirmed that the object was a device used by the Air Force to determine wind velocity and direction. It was sent up attached to a balloon and tracked by radar, since radar beams were reflected by the object. Horton retrieved the object from where he had discarded it, and gave it to Moseley, but Moseley subsequently lost it. In later years, Moseley lamented that if he had held on to the object, then it might have been he instead of Pflock who cracked the Roswell UFO Incident.
Lost Creek saucer video.
The Lost Creek Saucer sighting was a hoax brainstormed by Gray Barker and James Moseley in early 1966. The idea was to produce footage of a flying saucer. On July 26, 1966, in Lost Creek, West Virginia they had John Sheets — one of Barker's researchers — hold a ceramic "boogie" saucer on a fishing pole in front of a car, while Moseley drove and Barker filmed.
Afterwards, Moseley played the film during his UFO lectures, and Barker sold copies of the footage via his mail-order film business. Both men continued to claim that Sheets had innocently recorded the saucer landing. In "Whispers from Space," the footage is shown while Moseley discusses its origins.
Moseley later wrote in his book "In addition to showing the film on New York–area television and at one of the Saucer News monthly lectures, I incorporated it and the story behind it into my American Program Bureau talk. I had decided I needed a 'prop' for my lectures", then describes how he, Barker and Sheets made it.

Production.
Basing the script on Utpal Dutt's semiautobiographical play "Aajker Shahjahan", Rituparno Ghosh penned it in 2006, and turned to the actors in February 2007, all of whom accepted the offer. The film began shooting from 28 February 2007 to 10 April 2007; principal shooting took place in Kolkata and some shooting took place in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand. Dubbing for the film ended on 31 August 2007. 
"The Last Lear" premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September and received a significant reception, earning many accolades after being showcased at a Gala Presentation.
The film was later showcased at the London Film Festival, and the International Film Festival of India in Goa. The film was received positively by critics with many saying that Bachchan has given a career best performance.
Plot.
It is Diwali, a time when box offices are flooded with new releases and Shabnam (Preity Zinta) has to attend the premiere of her latest movie: "The Mask". However, she decides to visit her co-star Harish and heads to a cubbyhole of old Kolkata where Harish is bedridden in a coma. He is being taken care by Vandana (Shefali Shah) and a nurse, Ivy (Divya Dutta). Vandana treats Shabnam with spite as she blames her and the entire cast and crew for Harish's condition. But soon they are seen bonding over tea and are involved in a conversation about Harish. In flashbacks, their story and equation with Harish emerges.
The movie sees parallel narration from Goutam (Jishu Sengupta), a journalist who recalls his encounters with the veteran actor. He had suggested Harish for the lead role to his elder brother Siddharth (Arjun Rampal) who happens to be an ambitious perfectionist director. After a casual meeting with Harish, Siddharth realizes that to convince Harish to act in his film, he has to win his trust and establish a relationship with him. And, hence, the impatient young auteur attempts to win the trust and collaboration of the aged performer, who sits raging against the modern world from the sanctuary of his study. Sporting a silver mane, Bachchan is irresistible — vain, forceful and impetuous. He trumpets the superiority of Shakespeare over anything modern cinema can ever create. 
Harish finally agrees to act in the film. Shooting happens on the stunning Himalayan foothills of Mussoorie. On the sets he befriends Shabnam and teaches her lessons on acting, life and Shakespeare. As the story unfolds one gets to know his relationship with Vandana, the reason behind his quitting theatre and last but not the least the reason for his illness. "The Last Lear" becomes a captivating reflection on the comparative artifices of stagecraft and cinema.
Reception.
The movie received positive reviews from critics all around the world.

John Bevan (rugby)

John Charles Bevan (born 28 October 1950) is a Welsh international rugby footballer of the 1970s and '80s. He is one of two John Bevans who played for Wales during the 1970s.
Rugby career.
His début for Wales came on 16 January 1971 during the Five Nations Championship when Wales played England. He crowned the win with a try as Wales ran out 22-6 winners. He played in all of the other games in the tournament, but did not score again, as Wales went on to win the championship and the Grand Slam.
Starting his career in rugby union, he played for the Cardiff club and after being capped for Wales in 1971, Bevan toured Australia and New Zealand with the British Lions. He played in 14 matches including the first test and scored a total of 18 tries. The 17 scored in New Zealand equalled the record of Tony O'Reilly. He was a speedy winger (number 11) from Tylorstown South Wales and is chiefly remembered for his role in the Barbarians' victory over New Zealand in 1973, during which he scored a try.
During his short international career Bevan scored 5 tries for Wales.
In September 1973, Bevan switched to rugby league and joined Warrington for the then massive signing on fee of £12,000. He played Left-, i.e. number 5 and scored a try in Warrington's 7-14 defeat to Widnes in the 1974-75 Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 10 May 1975. He made 332 appearances for the Warrington club in which he scored 201 tries usually on the . He played for Wales and Great Britain.
John earned the nickname "The Ox" and "lad".
After 13 seasons, Bevan retired from the professional game. John Bevan's Testimonial match at Warrington took place in 1983.
International honours.
John Bevan won caps for Wales (RL) while at Warrington 1975…1982 17-caps 5-tries 15-points.
Career Records.
John Bevan is one of fewer than twenty Welshmen to have scored more than 200-tries in their rugby league career.
Personal history.
He has taught at many schools including: Ferndale Boys School, Culcheth High School, English Martyrs School and Arnold School in Blackpool.
In September 2000, after having stepped down as Director of Coaching for the Welsh Rugby Union, John Bevan joined the teaching staff at Monmouth School as a teacher of Religious Education and Director of Rugby Coaching. He currently coaches teams throughout the school, including the 1st XV who are unbeaten since he has been there. His catchphrase of "my granny could do better than that" meaning anything from tackle, to run, is perhaps the main reason for Monmouth's record of 123 games unbeaten.
Honoured at Warrington Wolves.
John Bevan is a Warrington Wolves Hall of Fame inductee.

Third Sacred War

The Third Sacred War (356 BC–346 BC) was fought between the forces of the Delphic Amphictyonic League, principally represented by Thebes, and latterly by Philip II of Macedon, and the Phocians. The war was caused by a large fine imposed in 357 BC on the Phocians by the Amphictyonic League (dominated at that moment by Thebes), for the offense of cultivating sacred land; refusing to pay, the Phocians instead seized the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, and used the accumulated treasures to fund large mercenary armies. Thus, although the Phocians suffered several major defeats, they were able to continue the war for many years, until eventually all parties were nearing exhaustion. Philip II used the distraction of the other states to increase his power in northern Greece, in the process becoming ruler of Thessaly. In the end, Philip's growing power, and the exhaustion of the other states, allowed him to impose a peaceful settlement of the war, marking a major step in the rise of Macedon to pre-eminence in Ancient Greece.
Sources and Chronology.
The ancient sources for the Third Sacred War are scant, and generally lacking in firm chronological information. The main source for the period is Diodorus Siculus's "Bibliotheca historica", written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore very much a secondary source. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else. Diodorus worked primarily by epitomizing the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; his account of the Third Sacred War therefore contains many gaps.
Beyond Diodorus, further details of the Sacred War can be found in the orations of Athenian statesmen, primarily Demosthenes and Aeschines, which have survived intact. Since these speeches were never intended to be historical material, they must be treated with circumspection; Demosthenes and Aeschines have been described as "a couple of liars, neither of whom can be trusted to have told the truth in any matter in which it was remotely in his interest to lie". Nevertheless, their allusions in speeches to contemporary or past events indicate some of the gaps in Diodorus's account, and help with the arrangement of a chronology. The accounts of Diodorus, Demosthenes and Aeschines can be further supplemented by fragments of otherwise lost histories (such as that by Theopompus) and by contemporary epigraphic sources.
Modern historians' dates for the war have been hotly debated, with no clear consensus. It is generally accepted that the war lasted 10 years, and ended in summer 346 BC (one of the few firm dates), which yields a date of 356 BC for the beginning of the war, with Philomelos's seizure of Delphi. Diodorus's chronology for the sacred war is very confused—he dates the start and end of the war a year too late, variously says the war lasted 9, 10 or 11 years, and included the siege of Methone twice under different dates—and his dates cannot therefore be relied upon.
After Philomelos's defeat at Neon, the Thebans thought it safe to send the general Pammenes to Asia with 5000 hoplites; Pammenes probably met with Philip at Maroneia in 355 BC, presumably on his outward journey. Buckler, the only historian to produce a systematic study of the sacred war, therefore places Neon in 355 BC, and suggests after the meeting with Pammenes, Philip went to begin the siege of Methone. Other historians have placed Neon in 354 BC, because Diodorus says that the battle took place while Philip besieged Methone which Diodorus (at one point) places in 354 BC. Disregarding the dates, most historians agree upon the same sequence of events for the first phases of the Sacred War. The principal question is therefore when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others lower all these dates by one year, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.
Background.
The war was ostensibly caused by the refusal of the Phocian Confederation to pay a fine imposed on them in 357 BC by the Amphictyonic League, a pan-Greek religious organisation which governed the most sacred site in Ancient Greece, the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. The fine was occasioned by the Phocians's illegal cultivation of sacred land on the Kirrhaean plain, which they did not deny; the fine was, however, far beyond the Phocians' ability to pay. Under normal circumstance, refusal to pay the fine would have made the Phocians religious (and therefore political) outcasts in Greece, and liable to have a sacred war declared against them.
Behind the religious element, there probably lay a display of "realpolitik" in bringing charges against the Phocians, instigated by the Thebans. The Phocians had declined to send troops on the Mantinea campaign of 362 BC, despite Theban requests, and this appears to have caused lasting enmity in Thebes. By 357 BC, with the Athenians embroiled in the Social War, and Alexander of Pherae (an erstwhile ally of the Phocians) dead, the Thebans deemed that the chance to punish Phocis had come. The Amphictyonic League was composed of 12 Greek tribes, primarily of central Greece (the Oetaeans, Boeotians, Dolopes, Phthian Achaeans, Locrians, Magnesians, Malians, Perrhaebians, Phocians, Pythians of Delphi and Thessalians), plus the Dorians (including Sparta) and the Ionians (including Athens), with each tribe having two votes in the council of the league. Thebes had effectively become the 'protector' of the league in 360 BC, after the civil war had restarted in Thessaly; the Thessalians having previously been the dominant power in the league. Thus, at this time, Thebes controlled a majority of the votes in the council, and at the autumn meeting in 357 BC, the Thebans were able to have both the Phocians (for the cultivation of the sacred land) and the Spartans (for occupying Thebes some 25 years previously) denounced and fined. Since the fines for both parties were "unjustifiably harsh", the Thebans probably expected neither party to pay, and thus to be able to declare a sacred war on either. There seems to have been some sympathy in Greece for the Phocians, since other states could see that "the Thebans...had used the Amphictyony to pursue petty and destructive vendettas".
The Phocians held a special conference to decide what action to take. Philomelos, a citizen of Ledon, advocated a pre-emptive policy of seizing Delphi (which was situated within the boundaries of Phocis), and asserting the ancient claim of Phocis to the presidency of the Amphictyonic League. In this way, the Phocians could annul the judgment against themselves. The Phocians voted in favour of his proposal, and Philomelos was appointed "strategos autokrator" (general with independent powers) by the confederacy, with his chief supporter Onomarchos also elected as "strategos". Philomelos travelled to Sparta to discuss his proposals with the Spartan king Archidamos III. Archidamos expressed his support, hoping that the Spartan fine would also be annulled, and gave Philomelos 15 talents to raise troops with.
Seizure of Delphi.
On his return to Phocis, Philomelos began assembling a mercenary army using the 15 talents from Archidamos, and also raised a force of 1000 peltasts from amongst the Phocian citizenry. In approximately July 356 BC, Philomelos marched on Delphi, just before the end of the period in which the Phocians had been required to pay their fine. He easily captured the city of Delphi, along with the sanctuary of Apollo. Philomelos captured the nobles of the Thrakidai family, who had probably been involved in imposing the fine on Phocis, and killed them, seizing their wealth to add to his treasury. He promised the other Delphians that he would not harm them, although he had initially contemplated enslaving the whole city.
Ozolian Locrian expedition to Delphi.
The news of Philomelos's move against Delphi resulted in a relief expedition being mounted by the Ozalian Locrians, probably mainly from Amphissa. Philomelos's army met the Locrians in open battle on a small plain between the city of Delphi and the sanctuary, and routed them with heavy losses. Some prisoners were taken, and Philomelos had them thrown from the cliffs that tower over the sanctuary (the Phaidriadai rocks). This was the traditional punishment for sacrilege against Apollo's temple, and through the means of this atrocity, Philomelos was asserting the Phocian claim to the presidency of the sanctuary. Buckler observes that "in his first acts, Philomelos set a brutal stamp on the war".
Fortification of Delphi.
After defeating the Locrians, Philomelos continued to strengthen his position in Delphi. He destroyed the stones which recorded the verdict against the Phocians, and abolished the government of the city, installing in its place a group of pro-Phocian Delphians, who had been in exile in Athens. Philomelos ordered the sanctuary be fortified on the western side (natural features defended the other approaches), and a large limestone wall was constructed. He then demanded that the priestess of Apollo (the Pythia) provide him with an oracle; she replied that he "could do whatever he wanted". Philomelos called that an oracle, and had it inscribed in the sanctuary, as was customary. This pseudo-oracle provided Philomelos with supposed divine justification from Apollo for his actions. He next sent embassies to all Greek states, asserting the Phocian claim to Delphi, and promising not to touch the treasury of Apollo; Buckler suggests that he did not expect the Greeks to acquiesce to his actions, but hoped to draw support away from the Amphictyons. The Spartans, as expected, endorsed Philomelos's actions, since their fine was now erased, whilst Athens also expressed support, following their general anti-Theban policies.
Declaration of Sacred War.
However, Philomelos's embassies elsewhere met with failure. The Locrians demanded that the Amphictyons avenge them and Apollo, and the Thebans sent embassies to the other council members suggesting that a sacred war should be declared against Phocis. This was assented to by most Greek states, including the Amphictyonic council members (minus Sparta and Athens), and those well-disposed to Thebes; furthermore, otherwise uninvolved states declared support for the Amphictyonic for reasons of piety. The Amphictyons seem to have decided that the year was too advanced to begin campaigning, and so agreed to launch military action the following year. They may have hoped that in the meantime, their sacrilegious behaviour would cause the Phocians to reconsider their position.
Start of the War (c. 355 BC).
Following the declaration of war against Phocis, Philomelos decided he would need to substantially increase the size of his army. Rather than levy the Phocian citizen body, Philomelos decided to hire more mercenaries; the only way he could afford to do this was by plundering the dedications in the treasury of Apollo. That the treasury contained much wealth, from years of accumulated donations, is well-established; it is estimated that the Phocians spent some 10,000 talents of Apollo's treasure during the war. In order to overcome the reluctance of mercenaries to fight for a sacrilegious cause, Philomelos increased the rate of pay by half, which allowed him to recruit a force of 10,000 troops over the winter, for the forthcoming war.
Conflict in Epicnemidian Locris and Phocis (c. 355 BC).
The following spring, possibly upon hearing news that the Boeotians were ready to march against Phocis, Philomelos took the initiative and marched into Epicnemidian Locris. Since the Phocian army would be outnumbered by the whole Amphictyonic levy, it is probable that he sought to defeat his enemies one by one, starting with the Locrians. If he could defeat the Locrians, then he was in a position to occupy the narrow pass of Thermopylae and block the union of the Thessalian and Boeotian armies, the main Amphictyonic contingents. Philomelos's army thus crossed into Locris, probably using the Fontana pass from Triteis to Naryx, or possibly the Kleisoura pass from Tithronion to the same general area of Locris. The Locrians sent a force of cavalry to oppose him, which the Phocians easily defeated. However, this battle gave the Thessalians time to pass through Thermopylae and arrive in Locris. Philomelos immediately attacked the Thessalians, and defeated them near the town of Argolas, whose location is not definitively known. Buckler suggests, on the basis of topographical considerations, that the modern village of Mendenitsa must be ancient Argolas.
Philomelos then laid siege to Argolas, but failed to capture it, and instead pillaged as much Locrian territory as possible. The Boeotian army, under the command of Pammenes, then arrived on the scene, and rather than oppose them, Philomelos backed off, allowing the Boeotians to link up with the Locrians and Thessalians. Philomelos had thus failed in his strategy of dealing with the Amphictyons separately, and he now faced an army at least equal in size to his own. He therefore decided to retreat before the Amphictyons could bring him to battle, and probably using the Kleisoura pass, he returned with his army to Phocis.
Battle of Neon.
In response to Philomelos's retreat, Pammenes ordered the Amphictyonic force to cross into Phocis as well, probably by the Fontana pass, in order to prevent Philomelos marching on Boeotia. The two armies converged on Tithorea (whose acropolis, Neon, gives the battle its name), where the Amphictyons brought the Phocians to battle. Details of the battle are scant, but the Amphictyons defeated the Phocians, and then pursued the survivors up the slopes of Mount Parnassos, slaying many. Philomelos was injured, and rather than risk capture, threw himself off the mountain, falling to his death. Onomarchos, who was second in command, managed to salvage the remainder of the army, and retreated to Delphi, whilst Pammenes retired to Thebes with the Boeotian army.
Second phase (c. 354–353 BC).
The Amphictyons seem to have concluded that their victory at Neon had effectively ended the war, and the Phocians would sue for peace. Otherwise, it is difficult to understand why Pammenes did not march on Delphi, or even sack the undefended Phocian cities in the Kephisos valley. In failing to follow up their victory, the Amphictyons wasted the best opportunity they had during the course of the war to end it. The Thebans seem to have been so sure that the war was ended that they agreed to send 5,000 hoplites under Pammenes to help the rebellion of the Persian satrap Artabazos, shortly after the Battle of Neon. The Thebans needed the money Artabazos offered them, and although they had generally been on good terms with the Persian king, they obviously felt the offer was too good to refuse. It is likely the troops were dispatched before the Phocian decision to fight on became clear, unless the Thebans thought that their remaining troops were a match for any army the Phocians could field. This was to prove a serious mistake for the Thebans, and the Amphictyonic cause in general.
Rather than contemplate surrender after the retreat from Neon, Onomarchos had rallied the Phocians, and insisted that they should continue the war. A meeting of the Phocian Confederation was held to discuss the future course of action, to which their Athenian and Spartan allies were invited. If they surrendered, the Phocians would face additional fines for their sacrilege, and for plundering the treasury; however, to fight on meant perpetrating still further sacrilege, and effectively committed the Phocians to winning a total victory against the Amphictyons. Whilst some were inclined towards peace, the majority were swayed by Onomarchos's orations and policies, quite possibly backed up by the threat of force from the mercenary army, and voted to continue the war. Buckler highlights the particular importance of the Phocian mercenary force on the decisions made by (or for) the Phocian Confedearation during the course of the war, and also the peculiar consequences it had for the Phocians: "The primary loyalty of that army would go to its commander and paymaster, not to the Phocian Confederacy. In effect, continued war forced the Phocians to put their faith in the hands of a man who could act regardless of their wishes but the responsibility for whose acts would be theirs."
His position now secure, Onomarchos had his chief opponents arrested and executed, and confiscated their property to add to his war-chest. He then set about raising a new army, doubling the size of Philomelos's force, until he had 20,000 men and 500 cavalry at his disposal. Raising such a large force required extensive depredations of Apollo's wealth; bronze and iron dedications were melted down and recast as weapons, whilst gold and silver offerings were melted down and used to make coinage. Although raising such a large army would have taken a considerable time, Onomarchos had the whole winter after Neon in which to do so.
First conflict in Thessaly (c. 354 BC).
The Sacred War appears to have laid way for renewed conflict within Thessaly. The Thessalian Confederation were in general staunch supporters of the Amphictyonic League, and had an ancient hatred of the Phocians. Conversely, the-city state of Pherae had allied itself with the Phocians. In either 354 or 353 BC the ruling clan of the city of Larissa appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them defeat Pherae.
Philip thus brought an army into Thessaly, probably with the intention of attacking Pherae. Under the terms of their alliance, Lycophron of Pherae requested aid from the Phocians, and Onormarchos dispatched his brother, Phallyos with 7,000 men; however, Philip repulsed this force before it could join up with the Pheraeans. Onomarchos then abandoned the siege he was currently prosecuting, and brought his whole force into Thessaly to attack Philip. It is possible that Onomarchos hoped to conquer Thessaly in the process, which would both leave the Thebans isolated (Locris and Doris having already fallen to the Phocians), and give the Phocians a majority in the Amphictyonic council, thus enabling them to have the war declared over. Onomarchos probably brought with him 20,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and a large number of catapults, and outnumbered Philip's army. The exact details of the campaign that followed are unclear, but Onomarchos seems to have inflicted two defeats on Philip, with many Macedonians killed in the process. Polyaenus suggests that the first of Onomarchos's victories was aided by the use of the catapults to throw stones into the Macedonian phalanx, as they climbed a slope to attack the Phocians. After these defeats, Philip retreated to Macedon for the winter. He is said to have commented that he "did not run away but, like a ram, I pulled back to butt again harder".
Second conflict in Thessaly (c. 353 BC).
Philip returned to Thessaly the next summer (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him in the war against the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice if they wanted to avoid being conquered by Onomarchos's army. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry.
Pagasae.
At some point during his campaigns in Thessaly, Philip captured the strategic port of Pagasae, which was in effect the port of Pherae. It is unclear whether this was during the first or second campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.
Battle of Crocus Field.
Meanwhile, Onomarchus returned to Thessaly to try to preserve the Phocian ascendancy there, with approximately the same force as during the previous year. Furthermore, the Athenians dispatched Chares to help their Phocian allies, seeing the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against Philip. Subsequent events are unclear, but a battle was fought between the Macedonians and the Phocians, probably as Philip tried to prevent the Phocians uniting forces with the Pheraeans, and crucially, before the Athenians had arrived. According to Diodorus, the two armies met on a large plain near the sea, probably in the vicinity of Pagasae. Philip sent his men into battle wearing crown of laurel, the symbol of the Apollo; "as if he was the avenger...of sacrilege, and he proceeded to battle under the leadership, as it were, of the god". In the ensuing battle, the bloodiest recorded in ancient Greek history, Philip won a decisive victory against the Phocians. In total, 6,000 Phocian troops were killed including Onormarchos, and another 3000 taken prisoner. Onomarchos was either hanged or crucified and the other prisoners drowned, as ritual demanded for temple-robbers. These punishments were designed to deny the defeated an honourable burial; Philip thus continued to present himself as the pious avenger of the sacrilege committed by the Phocians.
Re-organisation of Thessaly.
It was probably in the aftermath of his victory (if not before) that the Thessalians appointed Philip "Archon" of Thessaly. This was an appointment for life, and gave Philip control over all the revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, and furthermore made Philip leader of the united Thesslian army.
Philip was now able to settle Thessaly at his leisure. He first probably finished the siege of Pagasae, to deny the Athenians a landing place in Thessaly. Pagasae was not part of the Thessalian Confederation, and Philip therefore took it as his own, and garrisoned it. The fall of Pagasae now left Pherae totally isolated. Lycophron, rather than suffer the fate of Onomarchos, struck a bargain with Philip, and in return for handing Pherae over to Philip, he was allowed, along with 2000 of his mercenaries, to go to Phocis. Philip now worked to unite the traditionally fractious cities of Thessaly under his rule. He took direct control of several cities in western Thessaly, exiling the dissidents, and in one case refounding the city with a Macedonian population; he tightened his control of Perrhaebia, and invaded Magnesia, also taking it as his own and garrisoning it; "when finished, he was lord of Thessaly."
Thermopylae.
Once satisfied with his reorganisation of Thessaly, Philip marched south to the pass of Thermopylae, the gateway to central Greece. He probably intended to follow up his victory over the Phocians by invading Phocis itself, a prospect which greatly alarmed the Athenians, since once he was passed Thermopylae, he could also march on Athens. The Athenians therefore dispatched a force to Thermopylae and occupied the pass; there is some debate as to whether other contingents may have joined the Athenians at Thermopylae. The Athenians were certainly there, since the Athenian orator Demosthenes celebrated the defense of the pass in one of his speeches. Cawkwell suggests that the Athenian force was the one that Diodorus says was dispatched under Nausicles consisting of 5,000 infantry and 400 cavalry, and that they were joined by the remnants of the Phocians and the Pheraean mercenaries. However, Buckler argues that Diodorus never mentions Thermopylae, and the force under Nausicles was sent to help the Phocians the following year; instead, he believes that another Athenian force held the pass unassisted. Although it might have proved possible to force the pass, Philip did not attempt to do so, preferring not to risk a defeat after his great successes in Thessaly.
Third phase (c. 352–346 BC).
Meanwhile, the Phocians regrouped under Onomarchos's brother, Phallyos. After the huge Phocian defeats at Neon and Crocus Field, Phallyos had to resort to doubling the pay for mercenaries, in order to attract enough to replenish his army. Despite their defeats however, the majority of the Phocians were still in favour of continuing the war. Over the winter of that year, Phallyos engaged in diplomatic efforts to gather more support from Phocis's allies, and succeeding in widening the theatre of conflict in the next campaigning season. Uniquely in Greek history, the Phocians were able to absorb huge losses in manpower, thanks to their pillaging of Temple of Apollo, a factor which was to contribute to the war dragging on indecisively until 346 BC.
Fourth Boeotian campaign in Phocis (347 BC).
Philip had not involved himself in the Sacred War since his victory at the Crocus Field in 352 BC. In the meantime, it had become clear that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention. The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians. The Phocian general Phalaikos was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again.
The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance. Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war—he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.
Settlement of the Sacred War.
Preliminaries.
Athens and Macedon had been at war since 356 BC, after Philip's capture of the Athenian colonies of Pydna and Potidea. Philip had then been drawn into the Sacred war, on behalf of the Thessalians, as described above. Since Athens was also a combatant in the Sacred war, the war between Athens and Macedon being inextricably linked with the progress of the Sacred War. In 352 BC, Philip's erstwhile ally, the Chalkidian League (led by Olynthos), alarmed by Philip's growing power, sought to ally themselves with Athens, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip. In response, Philip attacked Chalkidiki in 349 BC, and by 348 BC, had completely destroyed the Chalkidian League, razing Olynthos in the process. The prominent Athenian politician Philocrates had suggested offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War.
In early 346 BC, Philip let it be known that he intended to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why. The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around 14 February. The Spartans dispatched Archidamus III with 1,000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid. However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae. It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines, that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try and negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.
Peace between Macedon and Athens.
When the Athenians received this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae could no longer be defended, then Athenian security could no longer be guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement. On 23 April, the Athenians swore to the terms of the treaty in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors.
Embassies to Philip.
After agreeing to the peace terms with Macedonian ambassadors in April, the Athenians dispatched a second embassy to Macedon, to extract the peace oaths from Philip; this embassy travelled to Pella at a relaxed pace, knowing that Philip was away on campaign against the Thracian king Kersebleptes. When they arrived, the Athenians (again including Demosthenes and Aeschines) were rather surprised to find embassies from all the principle combatants in the Sacred War were also present, in order to discuss a settlement to the war.
When Philip returned from Thrace he received both the Athenian and other embassies. The Thebans and Thessalians requested that he take the leadership of Greece, and punish Phocis; conversely, the Phocians, supported by the Spartans and the Athenian delegations, pleaded with Philip not to attack Phocis. Philip, however, delayed making any decisions; " sought by every means not to reveal how he intended to settle things; both sides were privately encouraged to hope that he would do as they wanted, but both were bidden not to prepare for war; a peacefully arranged concordat was at hand"; he also delayed taking the oaths to the Peace of Philocrates. Military preparations were ongoing in Pella during this period, but Philip told the ambassadors that they were for a campaign against Halus, a small Thessalian city which held out against him. He departed for Halus before making any pronouncements, compelling the Athenian embassy to travel with him; only when they reached Pherae did Philip finally take the oaths, enabling the Athenian ambassadors to return home.
Occupation of Thermopylae.
It was in the aftermath of finally ratifying the Peace that Philip applied the "coup de grace". He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks that he and his army was heading for Halus, but it seems certain that he also sent other units straight to Thermopylae. Thus, when he swore oaths to the Athenian assembly in Pherae, his troops were already very close to Thermopylae; by the time the Athenian ambassadors arrived home (9 July), Philip was already in possession of the pass. By delaying the oaths, and making what was effectively a feint against Halus, he prevented the Athenians from seeing their imminent danger, and from having time to garrison the Thermopylae.
Peace settlement.
All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace. However, the Athenians were still ignorant of this turn of events when Phocian ambassadors came to Athens to plead for military aid around 9 July. The Athenian council recommended that the peace be rejected, and Thermopylae be occupied in order to help save Phocis; since, as far at the Athenian embassy knew, Philip's troops were still in Pherae, there seemed to be ample time to occupy the pass. By 12 July the news that Philip was "in the gates" arrived in Athens; the Athenians then knew that the situation was hopeless, and instead of acting on the previous recommendation of the council, the Assembly instead passed a motion re-affirming the Peace of Philocrates.
Now that he was in control of Thermopylae, Philip could be certain of dictating the terms of the end of the Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed him to leave, with his mercenaries, and go wherever he wished. Cawkwell suggests that Phalaikos probably collaborated with Philip in 346 BC, allowing Philip to take Thermopylae in return for lenience for him and his men. Otherwise, it is difficult to see how Philip could have advertised his campaign so far in advance (and been so confident of success), and yet not been stopped at Thermopylae. Philip restored to Boeotia the cities that Phocis had captured during the war (Orchomenos, Coroneia and Corsiae), and then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. This caused great panic in Athens, since the Phocians could never hope for mercy from the Amphictyons, and since Athens was also (having allied with Phocis) shared in the same sacrilege. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes; allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.
In return for ending the war, Macedon was made a member of the Amphictyonic council, and given the two votes which had been stripped from Phocis. This was an important moment for Philip, since membership of the Ampictyony meant that Macedon was now no longer a 'barbarian' state in Greek eyes. The terms imposed on Phocis were harsh, but realistically Philip had no choice but to impose such sanctions; he needed the support of the Thessalians (sworn enemies of Phocis), and could not risk losing the prestige that he had won for his pious conduct during the war. However, they were not as harsh as some of the Amphictyonic members had suggested; the Oeteans had demanded that the traditional punishment for temple robbers of being pushed over a cliff be carried out. Aside from being expelled from the Amphictyonic council, all the Phocian cities were to be destroyed, and the Phocians settled in 'villages' of no more than fifty houses; the money stolen from the temple was to be paid back at a rate of 60 talents per year; He did not, however, destroy the Phocians, and they retained their land. The Athenians, having made peace with Philip, were not penalised by the Amphictyonic council, and the Spartans also seem to have escaped lightly. Philip presided over the Amphictyonic festival in the autumn, and then much to the surprise of the Greeks, he went back to Macedon and did not return to Greece for seven years. He did however retain his access, by garrisoning Nicaea, the closest town to Thermopylae, with Thessalian troops.

Joseph Aloysius Sweeney (13 June 1897 – 25 November 1980) was an Irish politician and military commander.
As the Sinn Féin candidate, Sweeney was elected to the British House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for West Donegal at the 1918 general election, defeating the sitting nationalist Hugh Law. He did not attend (aged 21, he would have been the youngest MP), and instead participated in the First Dáil. He is the second youngest ever TD.
In 1921 he was one of six Sinn Féin candidates elected unopposed to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland for Donegal. Again he did not attend and instead participated in the Second Dáil. In 1922 he was re-elected as a Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin candidate for Donegal and participated in the Third Dáil.
Sweeney was born in Burtonport, a town in The Rosses, a district in the north-west of County Donegal. He received his secondary education at St. Enda's School in Rathfarnham, where Patrick Pearse was Headmaster. He served as a Major-General in the National Army during the Irish Civil War in the early 1920s. Having spent most of his life in Dublin, he died in 1980 aged 83.

Regular category

In category theory, a regular category is a category with finite limits and coequalizers of a pair of morphisms called kernel pairs, satisfying certain "exactness" conditions. In that way, regular categories recapture many properties of abelian categories, like the existence of "images", without requiring additivity. At the same time, regular categories provide a foundation for the study of a fragment of first-order logic, known as regular logic.
Definition.
A category "C" is called regular if it satisfies the following three properties:
Examples.
Examples of regular categories include:
The following categories are "not" regular:
Epi-mono factorization.
In a regular category, the regular-epimorphisms and the monomorphisms form a factorization system. Every morphism "f:X→Y" can be factorized into a regular epimorphism "e:X→E" followed by a monomorphism "m:E→Y", so that "f=me". The factorization is unique in the sense that if "e':X→E' "is another regular epimorphism and "m':E'→Y" is another monomorphism such that "f=m'e, then there exists an isomorphism "h:E→E' " such that "he=e' "and "m'h=m". The monomorphism "m" is called the image"' of "f".
Exact sequences and regular functors.
In a regular category, a diagram of the form formula_1 is said to be an exact sequence if it is both a coequalizer and a kernel pair. The terminology is a generalization of exact sequences in homological algebra: in an abelian category, a diagram 
is exact in this sense if and only if formula_3 is a short exact sequence in the usual sense.
A functor between regular categories is called regular, if it preserves finite limits and coequalizers of kernel pairs. A functor is regular if and only if it preserves finite limits and exact sequences. For this reason, regular functors are sometimes called exact functors. Functors that preserve finite limits are often said to be left exact.
Regular logic and regular categories.
Regular logic is the fragment of first-order logic that can express statements of the form
formula_4,
where formula_5 and formula_6 are regular formulae i.e. formulae built up from atomic formulae, the truth constant, binary meets and existential quantification. Such formulae can be interpreted in a regular category, and the interpretation is a model of a sequent 
formula_4,
if the interpretation of formula_8 factors through the interpretation of formula_9. This gives for each theory (set of sequences) and for each regular category "C" a category Mod("T",C) of models of "T" in "C". This construction gives a functor Mod("T",-):RegCat→Cat from the category RegCat of small regular categories and regular functors to small categories. It is an important result that for each theory "T" and for each category "C", there is a category "R(T)" and an equivalence
formula_10,
which is natural in "C". Up to equivalence any small regular category "C" arises this way as the "classifying" category, of a regular theory.
Exact (effective) categories.
The theory of equivalence relations is a regular theory. An equivalence relation on an object formula_11 of a regular category is a monomorphism into formula_12 that satisfies the interpretations of the conditions for reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity. 
Every kernel pair formula_13 defines an equivalence relation formula_14. Conversely, an equivalence relation is said to be effective if it arises as a kernel pair. An equivalence relation is effective if and only if it has a coequalizer and it is the kernel pair of this.
A regular category is said to be exact, or exact in the sense of Barr, or effective regular, if every equivalence relation is effective.

<doc id="9790951" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9790951" title="Hydraulic pump">
Hydraulic pump

Hydraulic pumps are used in hydraulic drive systems and can be hydrostatic or hydrodynamic.
Hydrostatic pumps are positive displacement pumps while hydrodynamic pumps can be fixed displacement pumps, in which the displacement (flow through the pump per rotation of the pump) cannot be adjusted, or variable displacement pumps, which have a more complicated construction that allows the displacement to be adjusted.
Hydraulic pump types.
Gear pumps.
Gear pumps (with external teeth) (fixed displacement) are simple and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 cm3 (0.001 litre) and 200 cm3 (0.2 litre). They have the lowest volumetric efficiency (formula_1 ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the pump housing. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.
Rotary vane pumps.
Rotary vane pumps (fixed and simple adjustable displacement) have higher efficiencies than gear pumps, but are also used for mid pressures up to 180 bars in general. Modern units can exceed 300 bars in continuous operation, although vane pumps are not regarded as "high pressure" components. Some types of vane pumps can change the centre of the vane body, so that a simple adjustable pump is obtained. These adjustable vane pumps are in general constant pressure or constant power pumps: the displacement is increased until the required pressure or power is reached and subsequently the displacement or swept volume is decreased until an equilibrium is reached. A critical element in vane pump design is how the vanes are pushed into contact with the pump housing, and how the vane tips are machined at this very point. Several type of "lip" designs are used, and the main objective is to provide a tight seal between the inside of the housing and the vane, and at the same time to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact. Forcing the vane out of the rotating center and towards the pump housing is accomplished using spring-loaded vanes, or more traditionally, vanes loaded hydrodynamically (via the pressurized system fluid).
Screw pumps.
Screw pumps (fixed displacement) consist of two Archimedes' screws that intermesh and are enclosed within the same chamber. These pumps are used for high flows at relatively low pressure (max 100 bar). They were used on board ships where a constant pressure hydraulic system extended through the whole ship, especially to control ball valves but also to help drive the steering gear and other systems. The advantage of the screw pumps is the low sound level of these pumps; however, the efficiency is not high.
The major problem of screw pumps is that the hydraulic reaction force is transmitted in a direction that's axially opposed to the direction of the flow.
There are two ways to overcome this problem:
(1) put a thrust bearing beneath each rotor;
(2) create a hydraulic balance by directing a hydraulic force to a piston under the rotor.
Types of screw pumps:
(1) single end 
(2) double end 
(3) single rotor 
(4) multi rotor timed 
(5) multi rotor untimed.
Bent axis pumps.
Bent axis pumps, axial piston pumps and motors using the bent axis principle, fixed or adjustable displacement, exists in two different basic designs. The Thoma-principle (engineer Hans Thoma, Germany, patent 1935) with max 25 degrees angle and the Wahlmark-principle (Gunnar Axel Wahlmark, patent 1960) with spherical-shaped pistons in one piece with the piston rod, piston rings, and maximum 40 degrees between the driveshaft centerline and pistons (Volvo Hydraulics Co.). These have the best efficiency of all pumps. Although in general the largest displacements are approximately one litre per revolution, if necessary a two-liter swept volume pump can be built. Often variable-displacement pumps are used, so that the oil flow can be adjusted carefully. These pumps can in general work with a working pressure of up to 350–420 bars in continuous work.
In-line Axial piston pumps, swashplate principle.
Axial piston pumps using the swashplate principle (fixed and adjustable displacement) have a quality that is almost the same as the bent axis model. They have the advantage of being more compact in design and also allow use of "through-drive" series mounted auxiliary rotating equipment, based on their in-line design. The pumps are easier and more economical to manufacture; the disadvantage is that they are more sensitive to oil contamination. The axial piston pump is likely the most widely used variable displacement type, being found in everything from heavy industrial to mobile applications. By using different compensation techniques, the variable displacement type of these pumps can continuously alter fluid discharge per revolution and system pressure based on load requirements, maximum pressure cut-off settings, horsepower/ratio control, and even fully electroproportional systems, requiring no other input than electrical signals. This makes them potentially hugely power saving compared to other constant flow pumps in systems where prime mover/diesel/electric motor rotational speed is constant and required fluid flow is non-constant.
Radial piston pumps.
Radial piston pumps are used especially for high pressure and relatively small flows. Pressures of up to 650 bar are normal. In fact variable displacement is possible. The pump is designed in such a way that the plungers are connected to a floating ring. This floating ring can be moved horizontally by a control lever & thus causes an eccentricity in the center of rotation of the plungers. The amount of eccentricity can be controlled to vary the discharge. The suction & discharge can be totally reversed seamlessly by shifting the eccentricity to the opposite side. Hence both quantity & direction can be varied in a radial piston pump, just as in the Swash plate pump.
Peristaltic pumps.
Peristaltic pumps are not generally used for high pressures.
Pumps for open and closed systems.
Most pumps are working in open systems. The pump draws oil from a reservoir at atmospheric pressure. It is very important that there is no cavitation at the suction side of the pump. For this reason the connection of the suction side of the pump is larger in diameter than the connection of the pressure side. In case of the use of multi-pump assemblies, the suction connection of the pump is often combined. It is preferred to have free flow to the pump (pressure at inlet of pump at least 0.8 bars). The body of the pump is often in open connection with the suction side of the pump.
In case of a closed system, both sides of the pump can be at high pressure. The reservoir is often pressurized with 6-20 bars boost pressure. For closed loop systems, normally axial piston pumps are used. Because both sides are pressurized, the body of the pump needs a separate leakage connection.
Multi pump assembly.
In a hydraulic installation, one pump can serve several cylinders and motors. However, in that case a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own pump. In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. Gear pumps are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. Vane pumps and gerotor pumps too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw pumps can be combined with gear or vane pumps. Axial piston swashplate pumps can be combined with a second pump, or with one or more gear pumps or vane pumps (the gear or vane pumps often serving as flush pumps for cooling larger units). Axial plunger pumps of the bent-axis design cannot be combined with other pumps.

Kyoufu Densetsu Kaiki! Frankenstein

, is a 1981 Japanese animated television film based on Mary Shelly's novel and the Marvel comic book Monster of Frankenstein. In this 98-minute violent, adult-oriented film, the creature was portrayed as a misunderstood monster, who only wanted to be loved. The film was dubbed and released in the U.S in 1984. The dubbed version never had a title but was advertised as both "Monster of Frankenstein" and "Frankenstein Legend of Terror".
Plot.
The film centers around the life of Victor Frankenstein. After creating the monster together with his partner Zuckel, the monster attacks the assistant and falls from a cliff. Assuming the monster is dead, Victor returns to his wife Elizabeth and daughter Emily. A police inspector named Bellbeau investigates some mysterious mutilations killings, and Victor is blackmailed by his former assistant, who lost an eye in his fight with the monster.
Victor grows more and more paranoid, having terrifying nightmares about his creature, believing him to be pure evil. The monster survived his fall, and stole clothes and food from the villagers, who he killed in his confusion, including Zuckel. Victor's daughter, Emilie, spends time with her grandfather, a wise blind man who warned his son Victor about his experiments. When the monster finds his way to the grandfather's cabin, he becomes good friends with Emily and the old man, because they can see that he only wants to be loved, and they give him the name Franken.
Victor wanted to rid himself of all the evidence of his experiments, so he decided to hunt the monster down and shoot him. From Emily, the monster learns about God. When a fire breaks out in the woods, Emily's mother is killed, and Franken can only rescue Emily's grandfather. When Philip tries to shoot Franken, he is accidentally killed by the monster.
Emily thinks Franken did it on purpose and shoots his hand, and Franken is once again alone. He seeks refuge in a church, where gazes upon the crucifix, and notices that both Christ and himself has a hole though their hands, he breaks into tears, and begs god for forgiveness. Victor believes that his creation killed his wife, he finds him the church, but Franken escapes. 
The grandfather tells Emily that it was not Franken's fault that Philip died, and she sets out to find him. At the mountains, Inspector Bellbeau and his police force open fire on the monster. Emily comes to his rescue, and for the first time, Franken speaks her name. Tired of a life he never wanted, the monster commits suicide by throwing himself of a cliff. Victor, driven mad by all the terror he caused, shoots himself in the chest. Inspector Bellbeau visits Franken's grave, as the red scarf Emily gave the monster blows away in the wind.

El Musel

El Musel is a seaport located in Asturias, in the north of Spain, and in the middle point of the Cantabrian Sea coast it has the Port of Gijón which is a gateway to Europe through the A-66 Madrid-Asturias and Cantabrian highways, allowing direct access to the western and centre of the Iberian Peninsula.
History.
The El Musel port was built as a result of the industrial revolution that began in the second half of the 19th century in Asturias, based on iron and steel manufacturing and more particularly on coal mining in the central basins of the region. Right from the start, these two industrial activities were to be promoted by bankers and native and essentially foreign experts. Alejandro Aguado, Pedro Duro Benito, Policarpo Herrero Vázquez, José Tartiere Lenegre, Luis Belaunde Costa, Numa Guilhou, Adriane Paillette, Guillermo Schulz, Luis Adaro Magro, Jerónimo Ibrán Mulá and Isidoro Clausel de Coussergues are just some of the most representative names in an extensive group of industrialists and experts who were the true originators of Asturian industrialisation. The implementation of these industries was in turn to promote the progress of trade, the growth of the main urban centres and the adaptation of new communicational routes in the shape of roads, rail and ports, introducing a new capitalist production system into the region in contrast to the traditional agricultural economy.
Since the 1840s, mining-industrial development was to reveal the deficient state of tracks and roads and the inadequacy of the Asturian port facilities. The regions rough orthography made communications with the Castilian meseta difficult by both road and rail (the Gijón-Oviedo-León line over the Pajares bridge did not begin running until 1884) and the only way of ensuring the sale of the new industrial products was by sea, leading the need for a large commercial port in the central area close to mines and factories. Back then, the Port of Gijón was a small dock left dry at low tide, completely inadequate to meet the demands of the new economic situation. Several alteration and extension projects were then presented by the likes of the French engineer Eugene Flachat (1848-1850) and by José Elduayen, (approved in 1853), the engineer to have planned the Langreo Railway that took the coal from the Nalón basin to the local docks of Gijón as of 1857, completing the communications between Sama and Gijón that began with the building of the coal road between 1838 and 1842. Another project was drafted by Pedro Antonio de Mesa in 1856, of which the part corresponding to the Santa Catalina or Lequerica sea wall was completed in 1864 to shelter vessels from storms while waiting their turn to load cargo. By the end of the century, projects were still being approved to enlarge the Bombé (now Claudio Alvargonzález street) and Santa Catalina quays that, after continuous delays, were not completed until the start of the next century.
The growing demand for port infrastructures and the lack of means from the public authorities led to the involvement of private initiative in the enlarging, building and operating of the Local Port of Gijón. Hence, in 1870 Anselmo Cifuentes was awarded the tender to build the Victoria or El Muellín quay (where the former fish market building is located) and in 1879 La Sociedad del Fomento de Gijón was constituted to build and run the quays and docks on his behalf. Moreover, the increase in traffic and fleets from the coal industry also led to the establishing of ship repair and construction shops, with the installation in 1888 of the first industrial shipyard in Gijón on Natahoyo beach in 1888, the wharf of the company Cifuentes, Stoldtz y Cía. and today home to Naval Gijón.
All of this intense activity confirmed the urgent need to kit out larger facilities to provide docks and service areas in line with the intense port traffic that existed. The shortfalls thus left the port open to new alternatives or solutions.
In 1986, the bulk carrier Castillo de Salas ran aground while anchored outside El Musel. The ship was waiting for its turn to dock in the busy port.
Port of Gijón Expansion.
The Port of Gijón is the top dry bulk port in the Spanish ports system with an average annual traffic of more than 20 million tons the last years, 16 million of which are unloaded through the EBHISA dry bulk terminal. It is sixth in the general ranking of Spanish ports and the fourth in benefits. Designed in 1992 to unload a maximum of 12 million tons, has improved its unloading facilities and quays to deal with up to 17 million tons a year, although with occupancy indexes above that advised and with a vessel draught limit of 18 metres, which is detrimental to the service provided and a lack of competitiveness in relation to other ports.
The forecast for iron ore and coal traffic at the Port of Gijón by the year 2010 stands at 20 million tons, notably exceeding the capacity of the present terminal.
Enlarging the Port of Gijón will allow for modern, new facilities capable of meeting the needs of its customers, adapting to future demand and serving the modernisation of Asturian industry.
The actual expansion project of the Port of Gijón consists of constructing a new breakwater that, starting from Cape Torres and running for a total length of 3,834 metres along three differently structured alignments, was to form a wharf containing 140 Ha of sheltered waters. It also includes the construction of a quay located to the north of the wharf that measured 1,250 metres in length with draughts ranging between 23 and 27 metres and a width of over 400 m to allow for the simultaneous berthing of three bulk carriers of and 20 metres of draught. The inner slopes located to the West and South of the wharf complete the backfill protection, with a length of 1,732 m to give a total surface area of 145 Ha with land entirely reclaimed from the sea.
The new dry bulk terminal to be established in these facilities will have an unload capacity of over 25 million tons and a 60 Ha storage area to allow for the storing of up to 2 million tons of iron ore and coal.
Investments underway.
New Aboño Musel Connection.
This investment was started due to the considerable increase in traffic between the Marcelino quay bulk terminal and the storage area concession on the Aboño quay level through the present tunnel that does no meet the appropriate conditions due to its sections, access slopes and complicated layout.
The new track starts where the Norte Dock meets Cape Torres and includes a 390m long tunnel before running parallel to the Cape slope along the Aboño quay level to reach the current road.
This track will be eminently for use by the port and, where applicable, will also allow for access to the port expansion work, separating any local traffic that may continue to use the present tunnel.
Aboño Quay Level Enlargement.
This involves the provision of an 85,000 m2 area next to the northern side of the current quay level, moving the enclosure around 220 m and extending the channelling of the estuary. The enclosures will be 240m along the aforementioned extension and 430m west-east to reach the rock wall of Cape Torres.
These containment walls will be made up of different sections according to the stretch, with a paving core and 50 to 4,000 kg layers of riprap and blocks of 15 to 80 t. A concrete containing wall will be built with a similar mass to the current one.
Given the extensive experience of this Port Authority in the recovery of blocks, the work is to be carried out using almost all existing blocks and containing walls, which will involve a thorough study of the process to dismantle the present dock and its transferral to the new one to ensure it is protected at all times and to ensure that the least amount of risks possible are taken with regard to the present facilities.
La Osa Quay Enlargement (investment underway).
The La Osa quays take their name from the sandbank of the same name on which the Levante dock was built, which protects the port from north-easterly storms. The Levante dock runs over the La Osa and La Figar sandbanks and gave its name to the most ambitious project of the Port of Gijón in the 20th century and that formed the El Musel we know today.
This dock, the building of which began in 1964, together with its breakwater, has become absorbed by the La Osa Quays Enlargement project except for its initial section, reclaiming from the sea and protected by a sloping dock measuring around . in length and with variable sections.
The project consists of two independent actions: A barrage and a surface area enlarging the La Osa Quays and additional Backfill of the La Osa Quays, the backfill being obtained from the dredging of sand from the port entrance.
The total budget amounts to 38,000,000 euros.
"This project, co-financed by the European Union, assists in the reduction of social and economic disparities among EU citizens"

Censorship in Turkey

Censorship in Turkey is regulated by domestic and international legislation—which takes precedence over domestic law, according to Article 90 ("") of the Constitution (so amended in 2004). Despite the protections presented in article 90, Turkey ranked 138 in the Reporters Without Borders' "2010 Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index". In 2011-2012 Turkey ranked 148 out of 169 countries in the Reporters Without Borders list. Within the framework of negotiations with the European Union, the EU has requested that Turkey issue various legal reforms in order to improve freedom of expression and press.
History.
Regional censorship predates the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. On 15 February 1857, the Ottoman Empire issued law governing printing houses (""Basmahane Nizamnamesi""); books first had to be shown to the governor, who forwarded them to commission for education (""Maarif Meclisi"") and the police. If no objection was made, the Sultanate would then inspect them. Without censure from the Sultan books could not be legally issued. On 24 July 1908, at the beginning of the Second Constitutional Era, censorship was lifted; however, newspapers publishing stories that were deemed a danger to interior or exterior State security were closed. Between 1909 and 1913 four journalists were killed—Hasan Fehmi, Ahmet Samim, Zeki Bey, and Hasan Tahsin (Silahçı).
Following the Turkish War of Independence, the Sheikh Said rebellion was used as pretext for implementing martial law (""Takrir-i Sükun Yasası"") on March 4, 1925; newspapers, including "Tevhid-i Efkar", "Sebül Reşat", "Aydınlık", "Resimli Ay", and "Vatan", were closed and several journalists arrested and tried at the Independence Courts.
During World War II (1939–1945) many newspapers were ordered shut, including the dailies "Cumhuriyet" (5 times, for 5 months and 9 days), "Tan" (7 times, for 2 months and 13 days), and "Vatan" (9 times, for 7 months and 24 day).
When the Democratic Party under Adnan Menderes came to power in 1950, censorship entered a new phase. The Press Law changed, sentences and fines were increased. Several newspapers were ordered shut, including the dailies "Ulus" (unlimited ban), "Hürriyet", "Tercüman", and "Hergün" (two weeks each). In April 1960, a so-called investigation commission (""Tahkikat Komisyonu"") was established by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. It was given the power to confiscate publications, close papers and printing houses. Anyone not following the decisions of the commission were subject to imprisonment, between one and three years.
Freedom of speech was heavily restricted after the 1980 military coup headed by General Kenan Evren. Today, broaching the topics of secularism, minority rights (in particular the Kurdish issue), and the role of the military in politics risks reprisal.
Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law (Law 3713), slightly amended in 1995 and later repealed, imposed three-year prison sentences for "separatist propaganda." Despite its name, the Anti-Terror Law punished many non-violent offences. Pacifists have been imprisoned under Article 8. For example, publisher Fatih Tas was prosecuted in 2002 under Article 8 at Istanbul State Security Court for translating and publishing writings by Noam Chomsky, summarizing the history of human rights violations in southeast Turkey; he was acquitted, however, in February 2002. Prominent female publisher Ayse Nur Zarakolu, who was described by the "New York Times" as "ne of the most relentless challengers to Turkey's press laws", was imprisoned under Article 8 four times.
Turkey’s Journalists Union estimated that at least "72 journalists had been fired or forced to take leave or had resigned in the past six weeks since the start of the unrest" in late May 2013 due to pressure from the "Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi" ("AKP") government. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, head of the "Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi" ("CHP") party, said 64 journalists have been imprisoned and “We are now facing a new period where the media is controlled by the government and the police and where most media bosses take orders from political authorities.” The government says most of the imprisoned journalists have been detained for serious crimes, like membership in an armed terrorist group, that are not related to journalism.
TurkSolu, a weekly newspaper published Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan with gallows and addressing to the PM, 'You are a man to be hanged'. The newspaper issued this cover page on 25 November 2013 and since then except the criticism from other newspapers, no legal action was taken against the newspaper. Some media criticism websites criticized this cover page as provocative, not serving to any purpose and also another proof that press freedom in Turkey is better than depicted in Western media. 
Legislation.
Expressions of non-violent opinion are safeguarded by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Turkey in 1954, and various provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed by Turkey in 2000. Many Turkish citizens convicted under the laws mentioned below have applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and won their cases.
Beside the Article 301, amended in 2008, and Article 312, more than 300 provisions constrained freedom of expression, religion, and association, according to the Turkish Human Rights Association (2002). Many of the repressive provisions found in the Press Law, the Political Parties Law, the Trade Union Law, the Law on Associations, and other legislation were imposed by the military junta after its coup in 1980.
Article 301.
Article 301 is a provision in the Turkish penal code that, between June 2005 and April 2008, made it a punishable offense to insult Turkishness or various official Turkish institutions. It was amended on 30 April 2008, including changing "Turkishness" into "the Turkish nation" and making it obligatory to get the approval of the Minister of Justice before filing a case. Before the article was amended, charges were brought in more than 60 cases, some of which were high-profile.
Novelist Orhan Pamuk, at the time a Nobel Prize candidate, was prosecuted under Article 301 for discussing the Armenian Genocide; Pamuk subsequently won the prize. Perihan Mağden, a columnist for the newspaper "Radikal", was tried under the article for provocation, and acquitted on July 27, 2006; Mağden had broached the topic of conscientious objection to mandatory military service as an abuse of human rights.
Article 312.
Article 312 of the criminal code imposes three-year prison sentences for incitement to commit an offence and incitement to religious or racial hatred. In 1999 the mayor of Istanbul and current prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment under Article 312 for reading a few lines from a poem that had been authorized by the Ministry of Education for use in schools, and consequently had to resign. In 2000 the chairman of the Human Rights Association, Akin Birdal, was imprisoned under Article 312 for a speech in which he called for "peace and understanding" between Kurds and Turks, and thereafter forced to resign, as the Law on Associations forbids persons who breach this and several other laws from serving as association officials. On February 6, 2002, a "mini-democracy package" was voted by Parliament, altering wording of Art. 312. Under the revised text, incitement can only be punished if it presents "a possible threat to public order." The package also reduced the prison sentences for Article 159 of the criminal code from a maximum of six years to three years. None of the other laws had been amended or repealed as of 2002.
Other.
Article 81 of the Political Parties Law (imposed by the military junta in 1982) forbids parties from using any language other than Turkish in their written material or at any formal or public meetings. This law is strictly enforced. Kurdish deputy Leyla Zana was jailed in 1994, ostensibly for membership to the PKK.
Constitutional amendments adopted in October 2001 removed mention of "language forbidden by law" from legal provisions concerning free expression. Thereafter, university students began a campaign for optional courses in Kurdish to be put on the university curriculum, triggering more than 1,000 detentions throughout Turkey during December and January 2002. Actions have also been taken against the Laz minority. According to the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey only recognizes the language rights of the Jewish, Greek and Armenian minorities. The government ignores Article 39(4) of the Treaty of Lausanne, which states that: "o restrictions shall be imposed on the free use by any Turkish national of any language in private intercourse, in commerce, religion, in the press or in publications of any kind or at public meetings." 
In 1991, laws outlawing communist (Articles 141 and 142 of the criminal code) and Islamic fundamentalist ideas (Article 163 of the criminal code) were repealed. This package of legal changes substantially freed up expression of leftist thought, but simultaneously created a new offence of "separatist propaganda" under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law. Prosecutors also began to use Article 312 of the criminal code (on religious or racial hatred) in place of Article 163.
Pressured by the EU, Turkey has promised to review the Broadcasting Law. State agency RTÜK continues to impose a large number of closure orders on TV and radio stations on the grounds that they have made separatist broadcasts. In August 2001, RTÜK banned the BBC World Service and the Deutsche Welle on the grounds that their broadcasts "threatened national security." A ban on broadcasting in Kurdish was lifted with certain qualifications in 2001 and 2002. Other legal changes in August 2002 allowed for the teaching of languages, including Kurdish. However, limitations on Kurdish broadcasting continue to be strong: according to the EU Commission (2006), "time restrictions apply, with the exception of films and music programmes. All broadcasts, except songs, must be subtitled or translated in Turkish, which makes live broadcasts technically cumbersome. Educational programmes teaching the Kurdish language are not allowed. The Turkish Public Television (TRT) has continued broadcasting in five languages including Kurdish. However, the duration and scope of TRT's national broadcasts in five languages is very limited. No private broadcaster at national level has applied for broadcasting in languages other than Turkish since the enactment of the 2004 legislation." TRT broadcasts in Kurdish (as well as in Arab and Circassian dialect) are symbolic, compared to satellite broadcasts by channels such as controversial Roj TV, based in Denmark.
Self-censorship of Major Media Outlets.
Major media outlets in Turkey belong to certain group of influential businessman or holdings. In nearly all cases, these holding companies earn only a small fraction of their revenue from their media outlets, with the bulk of profits coming from other interests, such as construction, mining, finance, or energy. Therefore, media groups usually practice self-censorship to protect the business interests. 
An example of self-censorship is the case of Muharrem Yilmaz, president of the powerful business association TUSIAD. Employees of Sutas, a major dairy product factory owned by Muharrem Yilmaz, went on strike and company dumped animal waste to the area where employees gathered for strike. None of the major newspapers in Turkey such as Doğan Media Group,Sözcü due to their connections with TUSIAD published any news of this incident.
Majority of the newspapers, such as Doğan Media Group,Sözcü, Zaman (newspaper) are practicing self-censorship to protect their business interests and using the market share (65% of the total newspapers sold daily in Turkey are in opposition to the government) to pressure government to receive incentives from the government.
Internet censorship.
The Turkish government has implemented legal and institutional reforms driven by the country’s ambitions to become a European Union member state, while at the same time demonstrating its high sensitivity to defamation and other "inappropriate" online content, which has resulted in the closure of a number of local and international Web sites. All Internet traffic passes through Turk Telecom’s infrastructure, allowing centralized control over online content and facilitating the implementation of shutdown decisions.
In December 2010 the OpenNet Initiative, a non-partisan organization based in Canada and the United States that investigates, analyzes, and exposes Internet filtering and surveillance practices, classified Internet censorship in Turkey as selective (third lowest of four classifications) in the political, social, and Internet tools areas and found no evidence of censorship in the conflict/security area.
In 2010 Reporters Without Borders, an international censorship watchdog organization, added Turkey to its list of 16 countries "under surveillance" (the less serious of two Internet censorship lists that it maintains), saying:
In July 2010 the Alternative Informatics Association organized one of the first and largest street protests against Internet censorship in Istanbul. A second protest took place in May 2011 with demonstrations in 30 cities in Turkey.
In its "Freedom on the Net 2013" report, Freedom House gave Turkey a "freedom on the net status" of "partly free" (the middle of three categories: "free", "partly free", and "not free"), saying that:
On 20 March 2014, access to Twitter was blocked when a court ordered that "protection measures" be applied to the service. This followed earlier remarks by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who vowed to "wipe out Twitter" following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle.
Law.
On 5 February 2014 the Turkish Parliament adopted a controversial new Internet law to promote Internet regulation in Turkey that:
Crimes committed via the Internet are regulated by the older law, number 5651.
Beside the older media control and censorship association, RTÜK, a new governmental association, Telecommunication and Transmission Authority, can impose bans on Internet sites without prior judicial approval, (i) if the offending Web site hosts content that is illegal under Turkish law and is hosted outside Turkey, or (ii) a Web site contains sexual abuse of children or obscenity and its host resides in Turkey. The law prohibits:
Web sites are also blocked for the following reasons:
The Turkish Telecommute Foundation has a website for public reports. Decisions to block a web site can be appealed, but usually only after a site has been blocked. Nevertheless, due to the public profile of the major websites banned and the lack of juridical, technical, or ethical arguments to justify the censorship, the blocked sites are often available using proxies or by changing DNS servers.
Blocking of Internet sites.
Web sites are blocked for intellectual property infringement, particularly file-sharing and streaming sites; for providing access to material that shows or promotes the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, obscenity, prostitution, or gambling; for insults to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founding father of modern Turkey; for reporting news on southeastern Turkey and Kurdish issues; or which defame individuals. In addition to widespread filtering, state authorities are proactive in requesting the deletion or removal of content online.
Particular incidents.
"Nokta" magazine.
The headquarters of "Nokta", an investigative magazine which has since been closed because of military pressures, were searched by police in April 2007, following the publication of articles examining alleged links between the Office of the Chief of Staff and some NGOs, and questioning the military's connection to officially civilian anti-government rallies. The magazine also gave details on military blacklistings of journalists, as well as two plans for a military coup, by retired generals, aiming to overthrow the AK Party government in 2004. "Nokta" had also revealed military accreditations for press organs, deciding to whom the military should provide information.
Alper Görmüş, editor of "Nokta", was charged with insult and libel (under articles 267 and 125 of the Turkish Penal Code, TPC), and faced a possible prison sentence of over six years, for publishing the excerpts of the alleged journal of Naval Commander Örnek in the magazine’s March 29, 2007 issue. Nokta journalist Ahmet Şık and defense expert journalist Lale Sarıibrahimoğlu were also indicted on May 7, 2007 under Article 301 for "insulting the armed forces" in connection with an interview Şık conducted with Sarıibrahimoğlu.
Valley of the Wolves: Terror.
Early in 2007, the Turkish government banned a popular television series called "Valley of the Wolves", citing the show's violent themes. The TV show inspired a Turkish-made movie by the same name, which included American actor Gary Busey. Busey played an American doctor who removed organs from Iraqi prisoners at the infamous Abu Ghraib prison and sold the harvested organs on the black market. The movie was pulled from theaters in the United States after the Anti-Defamation League complained to the Turkish ambassador to the U.S. about the movie's portrayal of Jews.
Michael Dickinson.
In June 2006, police seized a collage by British artist Michael Dickinson — which showed the Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a dog being given a rosette by President Bush — and told him he would be prosecuted. Charles Thomson, leader of the Stuckism movement, of which Dickinson is a member, wrote to then UK prime minister, Tony Blair in protest. "The Times" commented: "The case could greatly embarrass Turkey and Britain, for it raises questions about Turkey’s human rights record as it seeks EU membership, with Tony Blair’s backing." The prosecutor declined to present a case, until Dickinson then displayed another similar collage outside the court. He was then held for ten days and told he would be prosecuted for "insulting the Prime Minister's dignity". In September 2008, he was acquitted, the judge ruling that "insulting elements" were "within the limits of criticism". Dickinson said, "I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions."
Editor of "Taraf" (2009).
In January 2009 Adnan Demir, editor of the provocative newspaper "Taraf", was charged with divulging secret military information, under Article 336 of the Turkish Criminal Code. He was accused of having published an article in October 2008 that alleged police and military had been warned of an imminent PKK attack that same month, an attack which resulted in the death of 13 soldiers. Demir faces up to 5 years of prison. On 29 December 2009 İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 13 acquitted Adnan Demir.
Media Markt advertisement scandal in Eskişehir.
Eskişehir’s Turkish Union Association motivated suspension of an advertisement campaign by Media Markt that the group claimed “insult Turkishness” by depicting consumers with animal heads goose -a cow, a carp and a sheep, each chosen for its implication of foolishness- that purchased overpriced merchandise. In the advertisements they used sentences such as "Am I a sheep?" "Am I bird-brained?" (Common insults in Turkish).

Longanikos

Longanikos (, also transliterated as "Logkanikos") is a traditional Greek village, located in Laconia, in the ancient and historical Peloponnese area of southern Greece. It is also referred to sometimes in English as "Logganiko(s)" or "Longanico(s)". It is about 30 kilometers north of Sparta, the capital city of Lakonia, and is also very close to the cities of Kalamata, Tripolis and Megalopolis. It rests on the eastern slope of Mount Taigetos. The current population of Longanikos is about 702 inhabitants according to government population statistics. This figure may include the population of the surrounding smaller villages like Vergadeika, Kiparrissi, and Foundeika. Because of the small size of this village, residents of this town often identify themselves as Spartans to other Greeks or foreigners. For those who are familiar with this area, a resident or person from Longanikos is referred to as a "Longanikiotes" (masc) or "Longanikiotissa" (fem).
Administration.
The village is administered as part of the Pellana region of the Laconia (aka Lakonia) prefecture. The Pellana region's administrative central office is located in the village of Kastania (aka "Kastorion", "Kastori") which is about 15 miles south of Longanikos. Diaspora Greeks looking for documents related to any legal, property, or citizenship issues for themselves or their family should look here first for information and guidance. However, in 2011 some of the administrative functions, formerly processed in the Kastori prefectural office, were migrated to municipal offices in Sparta.

History.
The village changed location and name many times since the earliest record of its existence in Mycenaean times. The area of Longanikos has been identified with the ancient village of Velamini (Velmini), documented in ancient writings by Pausanias over 1800 years ago. The current name has been documented in writings as far back as Stefano Magno in 1453. It is believed that this area has been inhabited since Neolithic times, and much later served as a front-line military outpost for the powerful Spartan city-state.
As a result of its geographical position between the 3 prefectures of Messinia, Arcadia and Laconia and because of the morphology of the ground where Taigetos and Parnonas converge without connecting, thereby creating the Laconian valley of Eurotas, Logganikos has served as a key transit point for the movement of people and armies in the Peloponese. It had also served as a military staging area and rampart for the state of Sparta.
Today the village of Longanikos also includes the settlements of Vergadeika, Kiparissi, Giakoumeika and Foundeika. It is nestled along the green slopes and fir-covered mountain range of Mt. Taigetos and one can find stone houses, natural springs and fountains and forest roads that lead to the highest points of the mountain (Koutouni, Limna). Nearby one can also find some fountains that feed the Eurotas valley and the historical monasteries of Rekitsa and Ampelaki, close to the Arcadian border.
Economy.
Most of industry in this area centers around olive cultivation, resulting in the production of olive oil as the main cash crop. The extra virgin olive oil that is produced is of the highest standards and quality and is sought out by olive oil importers globally. Most of the olive oil that is harvested is purchased by large Italian premium olive-oil labels who are known to repackage the local olive oil and brand it as an Italian product.
The younger people are also shifting away from an agriculture-based economy as their primary source of income. As more and more residents drive, they have expanded their job opportunities to commuting to nearby larger cities such as Sparta or Megalopolis where they take public sector or private service and manufacturing jobs. 
During the turn of the 20th century and also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a huge outflow of residents to other major Greek cities, including Athens and Sparta, and also externally to the United States, Canada, Germany, South Africa, and Australia.
This global diaspora of Longanikos emigrants still maintain strong ties with the village and during summer months the population swells with diaspora residents who have returned for summer holidays. In addition to its central location between Sparta and Tripoli, it is also only a 2.5 hour drive from central Athens and within driving distance of many famous sites, including Olympia, Monemvasia, Caves of Dirrou, Githeo, Kalamata, Corinth, the Argolid (Epidavros, Nafplion), amongst others.
Details of Various Diaspora Communities of Longanikiotes.
Massachusetts, USA"
A high concentration of emigrants who went to the USA settled in the suburbs of Boston MA, primarily the towns of Lynn and Lowell, Massachusetts in the 60's and onwards, which historically have been gateway cities in Massachusetts for various immigrant groups from all over the world. In the beginning of the 20th century, Ipswich was also a gateway city. One of the most famous people with ties to Longanikos was Harry Agganis, also known as the "Golden Greek".
Forest Fires 2007.
During the devastating forest fires of 2007, the village was spared any damage. However, the fires came as close as five miles away from the northern direction and also there was extensive devastation on the opposite side of the mountain.
Impact of Greek Economic Crisis.
It is believed that the village will see a net influx of residents as a result of the enormous economic displacement that is impacting the Greek nation as a result of the debt crisis which began in 2008. The simple, low-cost lifestyle afforded by the small town environment will undoubtedly attract many who are seeking a respite from the economic calamity impacting the larger cities.

Living theory approach

The Living-Theory approach is an approach to explaining educational influences in a person's learning.
Educational and other researchers are always faced with issues of validating their claims to knowledge. In the UK and elsewhere there is much interest in developing appropriate standards of judgement for assessing the quality of the knowledge generated by educational researchers. In 1995 Donald Schon advocated the development of a new epistemology for the new scholarship by Boyer and explained that this new epistemology would be generated from action research and would be a challenge to the epistemology of the modern research university (Boyer, 1990).
The idea that individuals can generate their own unique explanations for their educational influences in their own learning, in the learning of others and in the learning of social formations, as their living educational theory has been gaining credibility since the establishment of the Self-Study of Teacher Education Practices Special Interest Group of the American Educational Research Association in 1993 (S-STEP, 1993). A living-educational-theory emerges from the methodological inventiveness of individual practitioner researchers. We generate our explanations with the help of our living-theory methodologies. These methodologies draw on the self-study methods of a self-study methodology (Samaras, 2010). 
Living-Educational-Theory was the inspiration of Jack Whitehead, when serving as a lecturer at the University of Bath, and was defined and transformed into a pragmatic concept (Atkins and Wallace, p. 130-131) by Professor and Director of Secondary Education, Dr. William Barry, of Notre Dame de Namur University where the university offers classes specific to using Living Educational Theory in earning an education credential in California, USA to be public school teacher (www.ndnu.edu).The most recent discussion of living theory is Jean McNiff's (2013) book, Action Research: Principles and Practice, where she philosophically separates herself from Jack Whitehead's initial idea of Living Theory as overly focused on radical individual constructivism (Riegler, 2014).

Ben Taub

Ben Taub (1889–1982) was a philanthropist and medical benefactor in Houston, Texas. His family were Jewish immigrants from Austro-Hungarian empire and his father Jacob Nathan Taub moved to Texas in 1882. Ben Taub's family were poor and his father used to sell newspapers to make their living. Jacob Nathan later opened a tobacco store in downtown Houston. By the time Ben, their fourth child, was born they have become relatively comfortable. Taub grew up in Houston, where he attended Welch Preparatory School. During World War I, he was a captain and served in France. He returned to Texas and expanded the family business, later becoming a real estate developer. He chaired and operated dozens of companies throughout his life, including director, chairman and senior chairman of the board, Texas Commerce Bank; chairman of the board, McGregor Park National Bank; and director, American General Insurance Company.At one time he served on 23 boards, including president and then chairman, DePelchin Faith Home for 15 years; president, Baylor Medical Foundation; trustee, Baylor College of Medicine; president, Taub Foundation; director, Child Welfare League of America; chairman, Board of Managers, Houston Tuberculosis Hospital; founding board member, TIRR; director and life director, Texas Medical Center; Trustee, St. Thomas University; 32° Mason, Master Mason, Awarded Fifty Year Masonic Grand Lodge Award; district director, Office of Price Administration (WWII); chairman, Community Chest, United Fund, which is now United Way, and many others.
In 1936, Ben Taub donated thirty-five acres to establish a permanent campus for the University of Houston. He further pursuaded the heirs of J.J. Settegast to donate seventy five acres to the campus.
In 1943, he was instrumental in encouraging Baylor College of Medicine to move from Dallas to the Texas Medical Center in Houston. As chairman of the board of Jefferson Davis Hospital, he and Michael E. DeBakey made Jefferson Davis Hospital a teaching facility for Baylor College of Medicine, a relationship that continued after the creation of the Harris County Hospital District.
Taub never married and spent his time visiting patients in the county hospital. For years he helped run the DePelchin Faith Home for homeless children. He worked with the Pauline Sterne Wolf Foundation. He also worked with Charlie Massey, Harris County Commissioner for Precinct 1, on charitable endeavors. During the Great Depression, he had a chauffeur driven automobile, reportedly a Pierce-Arrow. He was a director of the Texas Medical Center, headed the United Way, gave out scholarships, and sponsored visiting medical professors. He served as chairman of the Jefferson Davis Hospital from 1935 to 1964. When Houston's new charity hospital opened in 1963 the hospital board, in recognition of his service, named it Ben Taub General Hospital. It became renowned as one of the nation's leading major trauma centers. Ben Taub died at age ninety-two on September 9, 1982. Baylor College of Medicine opened the Ben Taub Research Center in 1986. In 1990, the Harris County Hospital District opened the new, six-story, 500+ bed Ben Taub General Hospital.

MGP Nordic

MGP Nordic ("Melodi Grand Prix Nordic") is a Scandinavian song contest for children aged 8 to 15, organized by DR, NRK, SVT and YLE through FST5. It originated as a 2000 spin-off of Denmark's Eurovision Song Contest national final known as De unges Melodi Grand Prix, but expanded to become MGP Nordic in 2002 with the addition of Norway and Sweden.
History.
MGP Nordic was put on hiatus in 2003 when the European Broadcasting Union began to organize the "Junior Eurovision Song Contest", an pan-European expansion of the concept. Regional finalists were sent to the new competition instead of MGP Nordic until 2006, when the countries jointly pulled out of the contest due to concerns over the ethical treatment of competitors. As a result, MGP Nordic was revived in 2007, with the new addition of Finland to the competition. 
MGP Nordic was not held in 2010, because Denmark had pulled out in order to revise the participant requirements for DR's participation in the contest. SVT has since begun competing in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest again for Sweden, returning in 2010. In 2010, MGP Nordic was cancelled and has not returned since.

Benfotiamine

Benfotiamine (rINN, or "S"-benzoylthiamine O-monophosphate) is a synthetic S-acyl derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1).
It has been licensed for use in Germany since 1993. It is prescribed there for treating sciatica and other painful nerve conditions.
It is marketed as a medicine and/or dietary supplement, depending on the respective Regulatory Authority.
Uses.
Benfotiamine is primarily marketed as an antioxidant dietary supplement. In a clinical study with six patients, benfotiamine lowered AGE by 40%.
Benfotiamine may be useful for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy however "Most of the effects attributed to benfotiamine are extrapolated from in vitro and animal studies. Unfortunately apparent evidences from human studies are scarce and especially endpoint studies are missing. Therefore additional clinical studies are mandatory to explore the therapeutic potential of benfotiamine in both diabetic and non-diabetic pathological conditions". It is thought that treatment with benfotiamine leads to increased intracellular thiamine diphosphate levels, a cofactor of transketolase. This enzyme directs advanced glycation and lipoxidation end products (AGE's, ALE's) substrates to the pentose phosphate pathway, thus reducing tissue AGEs.
Pharmacology.
After absorption, benfotiamine can be dephosphorylated by cells bearing an ecto-alkaline phosphatase to the lipid-soluble S-benzoylthiamine. Benfotiamine should not be confused with allithiamine, a naturally occurring thiamine disulfide derivative with a distinct pharmacological profile.

International Fire Service Training Association

International Fire Service Training Association is an association of fire service personnel who are dedicated to upgrading fire fighting techniques and safety through training. The mission of IFSTA is to identify areas of need for training materials and to foster the development and validation of training materials for the fire service and related areas. IFSTA publishes such manuals as the "Essentials of Fire Fighting", "Fire and Emergency Services Instructor", "Fire Department Company Officer", "Chief Officer", "Building Construction Related to the Fire Service", "Hazardous Materials for First Responders", and many others. Other training materials published by IFSTA include curricula and study guides for many of its manuals. 
IFSTA is governed by an Executive Board consisting of 15 elected members and an Executive Director. The officers of the Board include the Chair, Vice Chair, and Executive Director. IFSTA itself has no employees or funds of its own. IFSTA’s operational expenses are funded solely by Fire Protection Publications (FPP). The FPP offices are considered to be the official IFSTA headquarters. Fire Protection Publications is a department of the College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology (CEAT) a division in Oklahoma State University (OSU) in Stillwater. 
IFSTA's motto is "Written by firefighters, for firefighters, for over 76 years."
The IFSTA Validation Conference.
The IFSTA Validation Conference is held each July. Committees of technical experts meet and work at the conference addressing the current standards of the National Fire Protection Association and other standards-making groups as they apply to IFSTA-validated manuals. These technical experts review all manual drafts and verify that the contents are valid. Committee members do not receive payment for participating and usually fund their own travel expenses to attend. 
The IFSTA Executive Board.
The Board has the sole policy-making authority for the Association so long as such policies do not conflict with the procedures of Oklahoma State University. Duties of the Board include establishing policies, establishing standing and ad hoc committees, discontinuing projects, establishing new projects, approving scope and purpose statements, approving titles for new and revised training materials, advising Fire Protection Publications on pertinent matters, and maintaining external relations with other organizations.
Some Board members are elected by the IFSTA Validation Conference delegates. Up to one third of the Board members may be appointed to the Board at the recommendation of the Executive Director and the Board Chair. Board members serve three-year terms. The Chair is elected by simple majority of the Board. The Chair presides over all Board and General Assembly meetings. It is also the duty of the Chair to appoint all standing and ad hoc committees. The Vice Chair is appointed by the Chair from the Board membership. The Vice Chair serves as chair of the Administrative Committee and the Delegate Selection Committee and assists with other duties as assigned by the Board. The Executive Director is an employee of Oklahoma State University who is approved by the Board. The Executive Director is empowered to act autonomously for the Executive Board in questions of policy that are of concern to the Association until such time as the Board can give those questions due consideration.
The IFSTA Delegate Selection Committee.
The Delegate Selection Committee selects delegates for technical input. This committee consists of three Board members and two conference delegates; the committee is chaired by the Vice Chair of IFSTA. The committee reviews applications, and the delegates are selected based upon technical expertise and demographics. 
IFSTA Technical Committees
Serving on an IFSTA technical committee is prestigious in the fire service community, and delegates are acknowledged leaders in their fields. This unique feature provides a close relationship between the International Fire Service Training Association and other fire protection agencies, which helps to correlate the efforts of all concerned. 
IFSTA technical committees meet and work at the conference addressing the current standards of the National Fire Protection Association and other standards-making groups as they apply to IFSTA-validated manuals. Committee members are technical experts who review all manual drafts (produced by the FPP editorial staff) and verify that the content is valid. Committee members are not paid, and IFSTA or Fire Protection Publications does not reimburse them for their expenses. Committee members participate because of their commitment to the fire service and its future through training. 
The History of IFSTA.
In 1933, newly hired Oklahoma A&M Fire Training Coordinator W. Fred Heisler and Stillwater Fire Chief J. Ray Pence invited various fire service representatives from around the state of Oklahoma to Stillwater to discuss coordinated fire training efforts throughout the state. Five two-day courses covering 10 basic fire fighting topics were developed. 
In 1933, Pence invited representatives from Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas to Stillwater. The Western Actuarial Bureau, a group of insurance companies, supported this meeting. As a result of this meeting, the participants saw a need to compile instructional manuals on the basics of fire fighting.
In the fall of 1934, the Western Actuarial Bureau brought together a group of fire training representatives from Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas to a meeting in Kansas City. The participants determined that there was a great need to compile instructional manuals on the basics of fire fighting so that training would become more consistent. The discussions and decisions that resulted from this group formed the basis for procedures that are followed today and represented what was then called “The Fire Service Training Association (FSTA).” (“International” was added when Canada became a participant in 1955.) 
Oklahoma A&M College (OAMC; now Oklahoma State University) was chosen to publish the works. The first professionally developed manuals that were written as a result of this meeting were released in 1937. They maintained the red covers used by previous OAMC fire publications. W. Fred Heisler, a teacher, trainer, and Director of Fire Service Training at Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State University) from 1934-1951, was the author, coordinator, and editor of the “Redbooks” for the next 20 years. Heisler retired in 1955.
After Heisler’s retirement, Everett Hudiburg became editor of the publication of the “Redbooks” — this operation was housed in the Number Two Fire Station on the campus of OSU. By 1965, the staff of FPP outgrew the fire station, and the people involved in the writing and publishing of the manuals were moved into Quonset Hut #2 — a World War II temporary building on the OSU campus.
Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, firefighters across the nation used the training manuals that were published at OSU. The publication and distribution of these fire training manuals continued until it evolved into a separate entity known as Fire Protection Publications (FPP) in 1969. It was led by its first full-time director, Harold Mace. In the early 1970s, FPP (the publisher of the “Redbooks”) and OSU Fire Service Training separated from the School of Fire Protection and became two cooperating entities.
Today, FPP serves as headquarters for the International Fire Service Training Association (IFSTA), the validating entity. FPP continues to write, produce, edit, and market IFSTA-validated manuals (many with study guides), FPP manuals, curricula, training videos and CD-ROMs, and other materials for the fire and emergency services.

Dolf van der Linden

David Gysbert (Dolf) van der Linden (22 June 1915, Vlaardingen - 30 January 1999, Hilversum ) was a Dutch conductor of popular music with a reputation which extended beyond the borders of the Netherlands.
Biography.
David Gijsbert van der Linden, the son of a salesman of musical instruments, was born near Rotterdam. Before World War II, he played in some different bands as a pianist and tried his hand at arranging music for these bands. His colleagues started calling him "Dolf", because he reminded them of a former colleague with that name.
In 1945, he was asked by Dutch authorities who had arrived back from their exile in London to form an orchestra for light music. Picking musicians he knew from all over the Netherlands, he thus managed to create the Metropole Orchestra. Famous names from these early years were Benny Behr, Sem Nijveen (both violinists), Jos Cleber (trombone) and Tonnie van Hulst (guitarist and singer). Van der Linden's professionalism and enthusiasm made sure the Metropole Orchestra built up a name for itself in the Dutch radio and TV landscape quite fast. It accompanied radio and TV shows and now and then also made some studio recordings.
In 1957, Van der Linden conducted the winning Dutch entry to the Eurovision Song Contest, "Net als toen", sung by Corry Brokken. In the year after, he and his orchestra accompanied the Eurovision Song Contest which was organised by Dutch TV in Hilversum. Afterwards, he was asked by, amongst others, the BBC to do some work for them. All in all, between 1957 and 1971, Van der Linden conducted 13 Dutch Eurovision entries, amongst which two winners (in 1957 and 1959 - the latter song, "Een beetje", written by the pianist of his orchestra, Dick Schallies). Moreover, in the 1970 contest, held in Amsterdam, he was asked by RTÉ to step in and conduct "All Kinds of Everything" by Dana, another winner. In 1969 he refused to go to the Eurovision Song Contest in Spain, because the Franco regime reminded him too much of his experiences in World War II. Frans de Kok stepped in and was lucky enough to accompany what turned out to be another winning entry, "De troubadour" by Lenny Kuhr.
In the 1970s, Dolf van der Linden tried to rejuvenate and modernise his orchestra. In 1980, he was pensioned off. His successor was Rogier van Otterloo. In 1999, Van der Linden died in Hilversum.

Shamoun Hanna Haydo

Shamoun Hanne Haydo, sometimes spelled Chamoun (±1880 - 1963 Sare/Mardin Turkey) was an Assyrian warrior and leader during the early 20th century. He was famous for his heroic stand against the Turkish government. He was well respected in the Kurdish communities as well, where he tried to unite secular Kurds and resist the enforcements of the Young Turks and Islamist Kurds.
He was, together with the Kurdish Alîkê Battê, one of the region's most respected men and warriors. Alîkê Battê was from the Mala Osmên family, the rulers of the Hevêrka clan, which included Kurdish Muslim and Yezidi and Assyrian tribes. It is widely known among people in those regions that Alîk and Shamoun were even closer to each other than brothers are. When Alîk took control of the Hevêrka Clan, he and Shamoun fought against other clans, even the Turkish government at that time.
Although these two were known for being fearless warriors, they were even more famous for being good-hearted and taking the side of weak. They resisted the Assyrian Genocide Genocide performed by the Turkish government.
Shamoun was born in the village of Sare, in Tur Abdin region of what is today Turkey. A Syriac Orthodox Christian, Shamoun was very well known among Kurds and had Kurdish friends. During World War I, Shamoun and his best friend Alike Batte together tried to unite their communities against governmental institution and oppressive Kurdish landlords.
Prior to the Assyrian Genocide of 1914, he travelled to the village of Arbo with the intention to unite the of "Beth-Rishe" region in Tur Abdin under a rule comparable to what Assyrians in Hakkari had with the Malik system. He tried to convince the two ruling family clans of Arbo, the Beth Arsan and the Beth Malkuno, to be ready to fight the Ottomans and their Islamic Kurdish allies.
Shamoun would eventually flee the Ottoman territory for Europe. Today, his grandchildren live in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Australia. Many Assyiran and Kurdish songs have been written about him by musicians.|

<doc id="9791362" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9791362" title="Sumatra PDF">
Sumatra PDF

SumatraPDF, also known as Sumatra, is a PDF reader for Microsoft Windows only. The program also opens Open XML Paper Specification, DjVu, EPUB, XPS, CHM, CBZ and CBR, and MOBI files. It is written primarily by two contributors: zeniko and Krzysztof Kowalczyk
Sumatra includes free software code under version three of the GNU General Public License, while the included Unrar utility is under a commercial "all rights reserved" freeware licence, making Sumatra overall freeware.
Features.
Sumatra has a minimalistic design, with its simplicity attained at the expense of extensive features. For rendering PDFs it uses the MuPDF library.
Sumatra was designed for portable use, as it consists of one single file with no external dependencies, making it usable from an external USB drive. This classifies it as a portable application. 
As is characteristic of many portable applications, Sumatra takes up little disk space. In 2009, it had a 4.2 MB setup file, compared to Adobe Reader 9.5's 32 MB. Install size is 8.2 MB, whereas Adobe Reader XI requires 320 MB of available disk space.
When re-opening a document, the rotation, zoom, window size, page, etc. are remembered from the last time that document was opened, making it behave more like an e-book reader than some other PDF viewers.
Sumatra does not lock the PDF file. Without closing the PDF file, a user can save over the PDF and then press the R key to refresh the PDF document. For example, a PDFTeX user could find this feature useful when, after recompiling the altered TeX source code, he/she could simply press 'R' and view the altered document. 
The PDF format's usage restrictions were implemented in Sumatra 0.6, preventing users from printing or copying from documents that the document author restricts, a form of Digital Rights Management. Kowalczyk stated "I decided that will honor PDF creator's wishes". Other open source readers like Okular and Evince make this optional, and Debian patches software to remove these restrictions, in accordance with the open source principles of interoperability and reuse.
Up to Sumatra 1.1, printing was achieved by transforming each PDF page into a bitmap image. This resulted in very large spool files and potentially slow printing.
Since Sumatra 0.9.1, hyperlinks embedded in PDF documents are also supported.
Sumatra is multilingual, with 69 community-contributed translations.
Sumatra supports SyncTeX, a bidirectional method for synchronizing TeX source and PDF output produced by pdfTeX or XeTeX. 
Since version 0.9.4, Sumatra supports the JPEG 2000 format.
Development.
SumatraPDF is written in the C++ programming language (some components it uses are written in the C programming language) and the source code is provided with support for Microsoft Visual Studio.
As it was initially designed when Windows XP was the current version of Windows, Sumatra has some incompatibility issues with earlier versions of Windows. Support for Windows 95, 98 and Me has since been dropped completely.
Kowalczyk has not released a 64-bit version of Sumatra, indicating that while it might offer slightly more speed and more memory available, he believes it would greatly add to user confusion and that the benefits would not outweigh the potential costs. However, some users have requested 64-bit builds of Sumatra and other developers have compiled unofficial 64-bit builds of Sumatra which load documents faster than the 32-bit builds. However, the official builds' developer has requested that unofficial builds must not bear the 'Sumatra' name.
The source code can be downloaded either via its Subversion development repository or as a tarball.
The Sumatra source code is hosted on Google Code and because of US export legal restrictions is thus not available "in countries on the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control sanction list, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria."
History.
The first version of Sumatra PDF, designated version 0.1, was based on Xpdf 0.2 and was released on 1 June 2006. It switched to Poppler from version 0.2. In version 0.4 it changed to MuPDF because of speed improvement and better support for the Windows platform, since Poppler decided to focus on integration with Unix platforms. Poppler remained as alternative engine for a while, and from version 0.6 to 0.8 it was automatically used to render pages that MuPDF failed to load. Poppler was removed in version 0.9, released on 10 August 2008.
Version 1.0 was released on 17 November 2009 after more than three years of cumulative development, and version 2.0 was released on 2 April 2012, over two years after the release of version 1.0.
The first unofficial translations were released in 2007 by Lars Wohlfahrt before Sumatra PDF got official multi-language support.
Name and artwork.
The author has indicated that the choice of the name “Sumatra” is not a tribute to the Sumatra island or coffee, stating that there is no particular reasoning behind the name.
The graphics design of Sumatra is a tribute to the cover of the Watchmen graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons.
Critical reception.
Sumatra has attracted acclaim for its speed and simplicity, its keyboard shortcuts and its open source development. 
At one time the Free Software Foundation Europe recommended Sumatra PDF, but removed its recommendation in February 2014, due to the presence of the non-freely licensed unrar code in Sumatra. Free Software Foundation Europe representative Heiki Ojasild explained, "while they continue to make use of the non-free library, SumatraPDF cannot be recognised as Free Software".

Samuel Lomax

Lieutenant General Samuel Holt Lomax (August 1855 - 10 April 1915) was a British Army officer who commanded the 1st Division during the early battles of the First World War. He was seriously wounded by an artillery shell at the First Battle of Ypres and died of his wounds in early 1915, one of the most senior British officers to die on active service during the war.
Early career.
Born in August 1855 to Thomas and Mary Helen Lomax in South-East England, Samuel joined the Scottish 90th Regiment of Foot as a junior officer aged eighteen in June 1874. In 1877 he travelled with his regiment to South Africa and participated in the 9th Cape Frontier War of the same year and the latter stages of the Zulu War in 1878, seeing action at Kambula and Ulundi, battles which secured British victory in the campaign. Returning to Britain with his regiment, Lomax was promoted to captain following the Cardwell Reforms which amalgamated his regiment into the Scottish Rifles in 1881. His unit was not called on for service in India or the Boer War and he did not see further action for 36 years. He was promoted to major in 1886, lieutenant-colonel in 1897, and colonel in 1901. In early 1902, he was transferred to a temporary staff posting as Assistant Adjutant General of the 2nd Army Corps, and Chief Staff Officer to Sir Evelyn Wood, commanding the corps. In 1904 he was given an operational command, 10th Brigade. He was promoted to Major-General in 1908, and in 1910 given command of the 1st Division. This was normally a four-year posting, and in late July 1914 he received notice that he would not be further employed due to his advanced age and lack of military experience.
First World War.
The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 put all plans of retirement on hold, and General Lomax was commissioned to command the 1st Division as part of the Expeditionary Force under Sir John French. Arriving in the aftermath of the battle of Mons, the Fourth Division was immediately engaged in the battle of Le Cateau where the advancing German Army was held up long enough to allow the outnumbered BEF to escape. Lomax also led his division at the battle of the Marne and the counter-attack at the battle of the Aisne. His operations were so successful that it has been said that he was "the best Divisional General of those early days of the war". On the 19 October, he received notice that he was to be promoted to Lieutenant General and would gain promotion to Corps Command when one became available.
During October 1914, the First Division was engaged in the First Battle of Ypres in the salient around the Belgian town of Ypres, with its headquarters based in a large stately home named Hooge Chateau, recently vacated by General Douglas Haig. On the 31 October 1914, a meeting took place at the Chateau between Lomax and his Second Division counterpart, Major-General C. C. Monro. An observer noted that the officers' staff cars were parked along the roadsides and provided an obvious target to German artillery. An aerial spotter soon noticed the gathering and reported the situation to artillery officers on the ground, who fired three 5.9" shells at the Chateau. Both sides had been targeting chateaux on either side of the line in an effort to kill senior officers and gain some advantage in the developing stalemate.
Death.
The first shell exploded in the garden, causing the officers at the meeting to go to the windows of the garden room to see the fall of the shell. Thus they were in the worst possible position for the second shell which exploded right in the window frame of the room. The explosion killed six officers and mortally wounded two others. The third shell impacted an empty part of the house, although the owner, Baron de Vinck, narrowly escaped injury. Monro had stepped into another room for a conference with his Chief of Staff and so survived with minor injuries, but Lomax was seriously wounded and evacuated back to England, being placed in a nursing home in London where he received palliative care for the next five months. 
General Lomax died on the 10 April 1915 never having recovered from his wounds. He was cremated at Golders Green and buried in a plot at Aldershot Military Cemetery, where he was later joined by his wife under a private headstone. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle later wrote that his death "was a brain injury to the Army and a desperately serious one."

Orson's Shadow

"Orson's Shadow" is a play by Austin Pendleton. The play received a Lucille Lortel Award nomination for Outstanding Play and won the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance.
The play debuted at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago in January 2000 and was performed at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego in September of that year [http://www.curtainup.com/orsonsshadow.html]. 
The off-Broadway production, directed by David Cromer, opened on March 13, 2005 at the Barrow Street Theatre, where it ran for 349 performances. The cast included Jeff Still as Orson Welles, John Judd as Laurence Olivier, Susan Bennett as Joan Plowright, Lee Roy Rogers as Vivien Leigh, Tracy Letts as Ken Tynan, and Ian Westerfer as the stagehand Sean.
Since its New York City staging, "Orson's Shadow" has been mounted by a number of regional theatres, including Marin Theatre Company in Mill Valley, California Round House Theatre in Bethesda, Maryland [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020702520.html, Unicorn Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri and the Gorilla Theatre in Tampa, Florida [http://www.sptimes.com/2007/03/01/news_pf/Weekend/When_the_stars_start_.shtml.
In 2006 it received a rehearsed reading at London's Old Vic Theatre . 
Plot.
Based on true events, it is set in 1960 London, where Orson Welles, already in the declining years of his career, is directing a production of Eugène Ionesco's "Rhinoceros" starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Plowright. Olivier, fresh from his triumphant portrayal of vaudevillean Archie Rice on stage and about to reprise the role in the film adaptation of John Osborne's "The Entertainer", and Plowright are in the early stages of a romantic liaison developing at the end of his tumultuous marriage to Vivien Leigh. All four, and critic Kenneth Tynan, figure in the plot, which debates the merits of stage vs. screen, the mental and emotional struggle theatrical performers endure when contemplating a leap to films, and what occurs when their movie careers are hampered by the controls thrust upon them by the studio establishment.
It is a study of theatrical egos, each of the protagonists living mainly on the stage than in real life, each one feeling insecure while jockeying for power.

Nested stack automaton

In automata theory, a nested stack automaton is a finite automaton that can make use of a stack containing data which can be additional stacks. 
Like a stack automaton, a nested stack automaton may step up or down in the stack, and read the current symbol; in addition, it may at any place create a new stack, operate on that one, eventually destroy it, and continue operating on the old stack. This way, stacks can be nested recursively to an arbitrary depth; however, the automaton always operates on the innermost stack only.
A nested stack automaton is capable of recognizing an indexed language, and in fact the class of indexed languages is exactly the class of languages accepted by one-way nondeterministic nested stack automata. 
Nested stack automata should not be confused with embedded pushdown automata, which have less computational power.
Formal definition.
Automaton.
A (nondeterministic two-way) nested stack automaton is a tuple ‹"Q",Σ,Γ,δ,"q"0,"Z"0,"F",[,],]› where
Configuration.
A configuration, or instantaneous description of such an automaton consists in a triple 
"q",
["a"1"a"2..."a""i"..."a""n"-1], 
["Z"1"X"2..."X""j"..."X""m"-1]
where
Example.

Properties.
When automata are allowed to re-read their input ("two-way automata"), nested stacks do not result in additional language recognition capabilities, compared to plain stacks.
Gilman and Shapiro used nested stack automata to solve the word problem in certain groups.

Rock Art (album)

Rock Art is the tenth studio album by the British melodic rock band Magnum and was released in 1994 by EMI.
Following on from Magnum's experimentation on "Keeping The Night Lite Burning", "Rock Art" took a contemporary approach with stripped down arrangements; blues, rock and roll and soul elements were incorporated into their sound. The radical changes employed in Magnum's sound since "Keeping The Night Lite Burning" and "Rock Art" can be considered as Tony Clarkin's attempt to move away from Magnum's sound and style established with the "On A Storyteller's Night", "Vigilante", "Wings Of Heaven" and "Goodnight L.A." albums, and perhaps even a reaction to grunge, Britpop and indie rock.
Clarkin said, "This is the nearest we've got to the "ballsier" side of Magnum live onto record. "Rock Art" is the best sounding album we've ever recorded, Bob's vocal performance has been stretched even further this time and everyone has had the freedom to play what they wanted to play."
Two singles were released from the album, "The Tall Ships" and "Back In Your Arms Again". However, they were only distributed in Germany.
"On Christmas Day" is a reflection on the First World War Christmas truce in December 1914, involving French, Scottish and German soldiers.

Ornstein–Zernike equation

In statistical mechanics the Ornstein–Zernike equation (named after Leonard Ornstein and Frits Zernike) is an integral equation for defining the direct correlation function. It basically describes how the correlation between two molecules can be calculated. Its applications can mainly be found in fluid theory.
Derivation.
The derivation below is heuristic in nature: rigorous derivations require extensive graph analysis or functional techniques. The interested reader is referred to for the full derivation. 
It is convenient to define the total correlation function:
which is a measure for the "influence" of molecule 1 on molecule 2 at a distance formula_2 away with formula_3 as the radial distribution function. In 1914 Ornstein and Zernike proposed to split this influence into two contributions, a direct and indirect part. The direct contribution is "defined" to be given by the direct correlation function, denoted formula_4. The indirect part is due to the influence of molecule 1 on a third molecule, labeled 3, which in turn affects molecule 2, directly and indirectly. This indirect effect is weighted by the density and averaged over all the possible positions of particle 3. This decomposition can be written down mathematically as
which is called the Ornstein–Zernike equation. Its interest is that, by eliminating the indirect influence, formula_6 is shorter-ranged than formula_7 and can be more easily described.
If we define the distance vector between two molecules formula_8 for formula_9, the OZ equation can be rewritten using a convolution.
If we then denote the Fourier transforms of formula_11 and formula_12 by formula_13 and formula_14, respectively, and use the convolution theorem we obtain
which yields
One needs to solve for both formula_7 and formula_6 (or, equivalently, their Fourier transforms). This requires an additional equation, known as a closure relation. The Ornstein–Zernike equation can be formally seen as a definition of the direct correlation function formula_6 in terms of the total correlation function formula_7. The details of the system under study (most notably, the shape of the interaction potential formula_21) are taken into account by the choice of the closure relation. Commonly used closures are the Percus–Yevick approximation, well adapted for particles with an impenetrable core, and the hypernetted-chain equation, widely used for "softer" potentials.

Let Them Chirp Awhile

Let Them Chirp Awhile is a 2007 independent drama-comedy by Jonathan Blitstein, filmed in just eighteen days in New York during October 2006. The film was produced by Anouk Frosch and Jonathan Blitstein. It was photographed by Andrew Shulkind. The release began December 5, 2008 in select theaters. It received positive reviews in Variety, the Village Voice and TimeOut NY. Opening weekend in NYC had a sold out screening on Saturday December 6, 2008 with the cast in attendance for Q+A.
The film had its World Premiere at the 2007 Woodstock Film Festival in Woodstock, NY where it received acclaim from both audiences and critics. The director of the festival, Meira Blaustein called the film a "a hidden gem" and praised Blitstein's "unique eye" during her introduction prior to the first screening, as the film had been accepted through regular submission.
Plot.
The basic storyline of the film follows Bobby and Scott, two young men in their late twenties who are struggling to make careers out of their artistic dreams but their competitiveness with each other gets in the way. Bobby is a screenwriter and Scott is a musician but neither of them are productive because they don't believe in themselves and they share incredibly high standards for their work. Bobby meets an old lover, Deirdre, who is headed to Los Angeles and she begs Bobby to take care of her dog while she's gone. Bobby agrees but only in exchange for a sexual favor. Later, when Bobby makes the mistake of sharing an idea for the opening of his new screenplay with Scott, Scott tells their mutual friend, Hart, a playwright, and Hart steals the idea, incorporating it in his new play "Death of a Banker", a campy morality tale about the September 11, 2001 attacks set to be performed off-Broadway later that month. Bobby loses Deirdre's dog and tries to figure out a way to get out of the situation.
Production.
Blitstein, was the youngest independent filmmaker ever to write, direct, produce, and edit a 35mm color feature-length film which was ultimately released in theaters. He wrapped shooting on October 24, 2006 when he was still twenty-three years old. After months of thinking and planning his script concept, Blitstein wrote the first draft script in 27 days and proceeded to assemble an indie crew composed mostly of friends he met at NYU film school. The total projected budget of the film was nearly $600,000, but because of donated 35mm film, equipment, and services from New York City rental houses and friends of Blitstein and Frosch, the film was completed on the last day of shooting with only $99,000. The film was funded by friends, family members, and Blitstein's own personal savings from his job as a waiter. Blitstein also "maxed out" more than seven credit cards. Locations used included Blitstein's East Village apartment, the apartments of his friends, and restaurants and local shops within walking distance. Blitstein convinced companies like Fender USA and Pabst Blue Ribbon to allow him to show their logos in the film to lend realism instead of using fake logos or covering logos which happens in many low-budget independent films. Blitstein cast the film by cold-calling agents of actors he was interested in working with. By convincing the agent's assistants to read his script, he got a foot in the door, and agents and actors began to express interest based on the script, even though Blitstein was an unknown filmmaker. The shoot was 18 days long and most of the film was shot in 1 or 2 takes because neither Blitstein or his production team knew how much film was going to arrive on set each day. Sometimes shots were done in a single take in order to save time and film. On the 12th day of the shoot, Blitstein collapsed due to stress and lack of sleep. He was admitted to the emergency room at Beth Israel Hospital nearby. Doctors discovered an unrelated non-life threatening kidney abnormality (Blitstein was born with a single kidney), and Blitstein quickly recovered, returning to set the next morning to complete the shoot. Blitstein edited the film in 47 days using a 12" mac laptop.
Theme.
The film builds on the cinematic style of 1970s New Hollywood filmmakers like Hal Ashby, whose "The Last Detail" and "Harold and Maude" begin with slapstick comedy and slowly shift to straight drama as the characters begin to look inward and make self-discoveries, ultimately returning to a blend of comedy-drama at the film's denouement. Let Them Chirp Awhile attempts to capitalize on this style while also maintaining a sense of heightened realism in order to lend the film an originality distinguishing it from other indie films of the late 2000s.
Aaron Graham of Uptown Magazine wrote that the film " much more to the early, sprightly comedies of Brian De Palma ("Greetings, Hi, Mom!") than to overplayed Mumblecore". The film has been repeatedly compared to mumblecore films such as Mutual Appreciation because of star Justin Rice although Blitstein has stated that he is not influenced by or associated with the mumblecore genre.
The result is a coming of age tale disguised within the indie genre. Because of its comedy-drama blend, it has been compared at talkbacks and forums at film festivals to films by Woody Allen, Wes Anderson, Todd Solondz and Richard Linklater.
"Let Them Chirp Awhile is a mix of realism and romanticism. Scoring the struggles of today's self-obsessed young people with the vintage sounds of melodramatic orchestral music, the film celebrates and satirizes their hopes, fears and dreams. The East Village becomes a place where everyday conflicts like having a meaningless idea appropriated by a friend, or a breakup are heightened to meet the characters' inflated visions of themselves. Let Them Chirp Awhile is as much a throwback to old films as it is a look forward into the destiny-anxiety that afflicts all of us in the digital age."

<doc id="9791508" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9791508" title="Hoava language">
Hoava language

Hoava is an Oceanic language spoken by 1000–1500 people on New Georgia Island, Solomon Islands. Speakers of Hoava are multilingual and usually also speak Roviana, Marovo, SI Pijin, English.
Introduction.
History.
Hoava is an Austronesian language that is spoken mostly on the island of New Georgia. New Georgia is a mountainous island, 85 kilometres long and 41 kilometres wide at its widest part, with a total area of 2,145 square kilometres, covered with dense rainforests (Davis 2003). The island of New Georgia was involved in WWII that was later named the New Georgia Campaign which lasted from June 20th to November 3rd.
Population.
Hoava is an Austronesian language that is spoken in 3 known locations: Western Province, New Georgia island, North Marovo lagoon, but mainly New Georgia island of the Solomon Islands. According to a 1986 census there are about 2,360 speakers of the language, but language is spoken by 460 people in latest census that was taken in 1999 suggesting a huge drop off in the number of speakers.
Sounds.
Consonants.
Hoava uses 16 consonants in its phoneme system, /p, t, b, d, s, β, m, n, r, l, dʒ, k, g, y, ŋ, h/.
Vowels.
Hoava uses 5 vowels: /i/,/ɛ/,/a/,/ɔ/,/u/. There is no phonemic distinction of vowel length, although vowels can be lengthened when stressed (Davis 2003). The vowels can be combined into pairs with the weight of two syllables (Davis 2003).
Syllable Structure.
Hoava has an open syllable structure of (C)V. Two vowels occurring together are counted as two syllables, since they function as such for transitive marking rules (Davis 2003). For many Oceanic languages of the Austronesian family group it is common that words do not end in consonant..
Grammar.
Basic Word Order.
In traditional typology Hoava is a VSO language. There are some modifications to this particular pattern for focusing and topicalization purposes (Davis 2003). 
Reduplication.
Reduplication is frequently used in Hoava as a method of word formation, to express intensification, and to form the progressive aspect of a verb (Davis 2003). Reduplication is used to create words denoting entities related to the referent of the source word, either as part of the entity, or a having a resemblance to it, or being a metaphorical extension"(Davis 2003). 
Numerals.
Hoava has a decimal system of numbering”(Davis 2003). 
Endangerment.
Materials.
There are not many materials written in Hoava. The only material of outside world access is a guide to grammar by Karen Davis and a storybook. With it only beginning to fall out of use. There are translations of the bible and stories but not much else is known about surviving materials.
Vitality.
According to Ethnologue, Hoava has a 6b (Yellow) endangerment status. “Intergenerational transmission is in the process of being broken, but the childbearing generation can still use the language so it is possible that revitalization efforts could restore transmission of the language in the home”(Lewis 2013).Without intergenerational transfer, main outlet uses will soon be destroyed or fade away while other languages take its place. With the decrease of L1 speakers, the value of the language in the community will only drop, till it is no longer applicable to the community. Combined with the low amount of speakers, if no action is to take place, Hoava will fade to away into disuse.

<doc id="9791512" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9791512" title="Elastic bandage">
Elastic bandage

An elastic bandage is a "stretchable bandage used to create localized pressure". Elastic bandages are commonly used to treat muscle sprains and strains by reducing the flow of blood to a particular area by the application of even stable pressure which can restrict swelling at the place of injury. Elastic bandages are also used to treat bone fractures. Padding is applied to the fractured limb, then a splint (usually plaster) is applied. The elastic bandage is then applied to hold the splint in place and to protect it. This is a common technique for fractures which may swell, which would cause a cast to function improperly. These types of splints are usually removed after swelling has decreased and then a fiberglass or plaster cast can be applied.
Due to the risk of latex allergies among users, the original composition of elastic bandages has changed. While some bandages are still manufactured with latex, many woven and knitted elastic bandages provide adequate compression without the use of natural rubber or latex. The modern elastic bandage is constructed from cotton, polyester and latex-free elastic yarns. By varying the ratio of cotton, polyester, and the elastic yarns within a bandage, manufacturers are able to offer various grades of compression and durability in their wraps. Often aluminum or stretchable clips are used to fasten the bandage in place once it has been wrapped around the injury. Some elastic bandages even use Velcro closures to secure and stabilize the wrap in place.
Aside from use in sports medicine and by orthopedists, elastic bandages are popular in the treatment of lymphedema and other venous conditions, for weight loss when applied as a body wrap, and rehabilitating injured animals through veterinary medicine. These bandages are often used as a method to compress breasts by transgender people (although this method of binding can cause rib damage and bruising), for general cross dressing, acting and men with abnormally large or shaped chests to help create a more masculine body shape.
Elastic bandages should not be confused with compression therapy devices designed for the purpose of venous edema management or lymphedema management. Such devices are specifically designed to deliver graduated compression from the ankle to the knee, to assist with venous return.

John Crichton, 3rd Earl Erne

The Rt. Hon. John Crichton, 3rd Earl Erne, KP (30 July 1802 – 3 October 1885), was an Anglo-Irish peer and politician.
Lord Erne succeeded his uncle as third Earl Erne in 1842. In 1845 he was elected an Irish Representative Peer in the House of Lords, which he remained until his death. He also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh from 1845 to 1885. Erne was made a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1868 and in 1876 he was created Baron Fermanagh, of Lisnaskea in the County of Fermanagh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords.
Lord Erne is also remembered as the employer of the hapless Captain Charles Boycott, whose mishandling of relations with agricultural workers on Lord Erne's estate in County Mayo caused a political and public order crisis and provoked the strategy that gave the English language the term to "boycott".
Lord Erne married Selina Griselda, daughter of The Rev. Charles Cobbe Beresford, in 1837. He died in October 1885, aged 83, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son John, who became a Conservative government minister.

SplitFire spark plug

The "SplitFire spark plug" is a spark plug featuring a split ground electrode. SplitFire claims that this "V" electrode design allows more complete combustion by allowing the ignited flame to pass through the gap in the electrode, instead of around the electrode. 
SplitFire spark plugs were popular and heavily advertised in the early 1990s despite controversy over their effectiveness. The manufacturer also sponsored the SplitFire Spark Plug 500 NASCAR stock car race. In 1997, the United States Federal Trade Commission charged SplitFire with deceptive advertising. The manufacturer settled the charges with the FTC; as part of the settlement, SplitFire was prohibited from making deceptive claims about fuel economy or emissions. After the settlement, the popularity of SplitFire's spark plug range declined, but many drivers continue to use the product. The company still exists today, and its range of products has been expanded to include plug leads, dials and gauges, DIS coil packs and several other products in this area of the performance market.

Kayamath

Kayamath is an Indian soap opera that aired on STAR Plus. The soap started airing on February 19, 2007 and ended on March 12, 2009.This show gained much popularity. It has been top 10 show of Star Plus of all time.
Plot.
Kayamath emphasizes how relationships change over the course of time, with the concept of everlasting love as the underlying theme of the show. It is the story of Prachi, an ordinary young woman who faces many extraordinary situations in life.
The story begins with the introduction of two pairs of best friends living completely different lifestyles — Prachi/Neev and Milind/Ayesha.
Brought up in the lap of luxury, Neev Shergill and Prachi Shah are oblivious to the harsh realities that people often face in life. They are the children of close friends and business partners - Pranay Shergill and Inder Shah. Neev and Prachi are simple, straightforward characters. Their childhood friendship blossoms into love as they grow up.
On the other hand, Milind Mishra and Ayesha Mehra have lived in poverty all their lives. They've learned to stand up for themselves and know how to deal with challenging situations. They, too, have been in love since they were kids.
Eventually, Prachi and Ayesha meet and become close friends within a short time. Neev and Milind are unhappy with this as they can't stand their friendship. Milind believes that Prachi is too much of a spoiled little princess, while Neev sees Ayesha as an ill-mannered, disrespectful brat. Meanwhile, Prachi's brother Alaap starts a relationship with Milind's sister Sukriti. Things turn ugly between Prachi and Milind's families when Alaap humiliates Sukriti and dumps her after a one-night stand.
A shocking secret comes to light on the day Prachi's father dies, which brings Ayesha and Prachi's friendship to a halt. They discover that they are paternal half-sisters. Their father Inder once had an extramarital affair with Amrita (Ayesha's mother) while he was married to Premlata (Prachi's mother). Inder abandoned Amrita and went back to Premlata for the sake of the newborn Prachi. He was unaware that Amrita was pregnant with his child, Ayesha. Amrita became mentally unstable out of misery. Inder came to know of Ayesha's existence after her birth but didn't have the courage to face Amrita again. As a result, Ayesha was raised without either of her parents being actively involved in her life.
Ayesha begins to resent Prachi, holding her responsible for the way her life turned out and for Amrita's condition. A misunderstanding created by Alaap makes Ayesha's resentment turn into hatred. She decides to make Prachi pay. She takes over the Shah family's business empire and warns Prachi that she would hurt her by making sure she and Neev don't stay together. Prachi breaks up with Neev as she had promised her dead father that she'd always look out for Ayesha's best interests. Soon, Ayesha blackmails Neev into marrying her. Shortly after they get married, Prachi finds out that her father didn't die in an accident — he was murdered.
Milind, who had moved to Turkey to make money, re-enters the story as a millionaire. Now powerful and wealthy, he wants revenge against the Shahs for what they put him, Sukriti and Ayesha through. However, he is shattered when he finds out that Ayesha has married Neev. To teach Ayesha a lesson as well as to make Prachi pay for Alaap's misdeeds, he presents Prachi with a deal: He will help her find out who killed her father if she agrees to get into a marriage of convenience with him. Prachi accepts.
Milind and Prachi's marriage leaves Neev and Ayesha devastated. Milind uses Prachi to make Ayesha jealous, but when he's alone with Prachi he mistreats and humiliates her. However, she fulfills all the duties of a wife without hesitation and quietly puts up with Milind's misbehaviour. Slowly, Milind starts respecting and caring for Prachi. Ayesha constantly attempts to create misunderstandings between the two by making Milind believe that Prachi couldn't care less about him or their marriage. She also implies that Prachi is cheating on him with Neev. Eventually, Neev comes to know that Ayesha was the reason why Prachi ended her relationship with him. He confronts her, declaring his love while she apologizes. Milind witnesses this, which further instigates his suspicions. One situation leads to another and Milind/Prachi have a heated confrontation one night. The misunderstandings are cleared; Milind pulls Prachi into a kiss and they consummate their marriage.
Milind and Prachi's relationship continues to grow stronger. Prachi comes to know about Sukriti and Alaap's illegitimate son, Ritvik, whom Sukriti has kept a secret. Prachi brings the child home and pretends to be his mother after Ayesha claims that he is the product of Prachi's extramarital affair with Neev. This infuriates Milind and he takes the matter to court. The two nearly get divorced, but the truth comes out just in time — much to Ayesha's displeasure. She decides to get Prachi out of Milind's life once and for all, by murdering her. Her plan backfires: Milind is the one who gets hit by her car. This causes him to have partial amnesia, where he doesn't remember his life beyond his return from Turkey. Ayesha seizes this opportunity to the fullest by encouraging Milind to avenge the Shahs through Prachi. Meanwhile, Neev ends his marriage with Ayesha, who forces him and Prachi to marry so that Milind could be hers. A date is set for the Neev/Prachi and Milind/Ayesha weddings. In spite of his seething hatred towards Prachi, Milind finds himself drawn towards her. A mutual confession follows between Milind/Prachi, after which Milind leaves Ayesha at the altar. His memory returns after Ayesha unintentionally tells him about the memories of him and Prachi which he has forgotten. Seeing that Milind/Prachi have reunited in spite of all the hurdles she created, Ayesha gives up on her quest to tear them apart.
Mallika, a businesswoman, enters the story. She is instantly smitten by Milind and thus plots to get Prachi out of the picture. Ayesha gets wind of her true intentions and warns her to stay away from Milind/Prachi. One night Mallika brings Milind to her uncle's farmhouse and tampers with his drink, making him pass out. Before she could take advantage of the situation, Ayesha shows up. The two get into a scuffle, during which Mallika stabs and kills Ayesha. Prachi learns that she is pregnant but, before she can tell Milind, she finds out that Ayesha has been murdered and Milind is arrested for it.
Mallika forces Prachi to leave Milind on the condition that she'll stand as witness and help Milind to get rid of the false accusations. After a lot of hesitation, Prachi agrees and leaves Milind to catch a train. In the meanwhile, Milind is released. Prachi humiliates him over the phone but cannot keep herself away when she comes to know that Milind has gone to visit Mallika. Milind figures out that Mallika is responsible for Prachi's sudden decision to leave him. He tries to stop Prachi but in vain. Prachi gets into a train to Kolkata. She meets a Bengali couple - Proteek Dasgupta and his wife Panchi, who are travelling with their infant. Panchi hears out Prachi's story and urges Proteek to convince her to stay with them at their house. Milind drives off to the station where Prachi's train is supposed to arrive. Upon reaching there, he and the Shahs come to know that there has been a blast in the Kolkata express. They find Prachi's belongings and assume she's dead.
Five years later.
The scene shifts to five years later, where Prachi is shown to be living with Proteek and his family. Through flashbacks it is revealed that Panchi had died in the bomb blast. Proteek honoured her last wish by inviting Prachi to stay with him and his family. Prachi accepted his offer seeing as she had nowhere else to go. When they arrived at the Dasgupta household, Prachi was assumed to be Panchi as nobody had met the real Panchi before. Proteek requested Prachi to pretend to be his wife as his ailing father wouldn't be able to bear the shock of his daughter-in-law's death. Back to the present, Proteek and Prachi have been pretending to be a couple for the last five years. They're raising two children, Suprateek (Proteek and Panchi's son) and Sumonto (Milind and Prachi's son). Proteek has fallen in love with Prachi and hopes that she'll reciprocate his feelings someday.
On Sumonto's birthday, Prachi gives him a gold chain she had made for Milind. Sumonto, being his usual naughty self, is chased by Tanushree Dasgupta, Proteek's elder sister-in-law. Sumonto falls from the terrace and hurts himself badly. He has to be hospitalized. Prachi fails to arrange blood for Sumonto. When she reaches the hospital, Proteek tells her that a stranger has donated blood to Sumonto. Prachi wants to thank the stranger personally and goes to his room. Although she cannot find the person, she finds a locket with Milind's and her picture. Prachi is convinced that Milind saved their child's life and runs after him to meet him. But she remembers Mallika's warning and stops herself.
The nurse from the hospital calls Prachi up and says that the man who donated blood to Sumonto is at the hospital and wants his locket back. Prachi rushes there but misses him. She finds out that he left with a social worker named Sushmita Chatterjee. Later on, she meets Sushmita, who reveals that she runs a rehabilitation center for people who are alone and distressed. A completely shattered Milind is shown sitting on the floor of a room in the rehab center, clutching Prachi's picture. His appearance is extremely shaggy and unkempt.
Prachi reaches the rehab center to meet Milind only to find out he has left already. Meanwhile Proteek has an accident on his way from Bhuvaneshwar to Kolkata. Milind saves him and brings him back to Kolkata. Prachi sees Milind but hides from him as she is in a dilemma about which to choose between her love Milind and her responsibility to the Dasguptas. During his stay, Milind begins to bond with Sumonto. After he comes face to face with Prachi, she explains why she's living with the Dasguptas and that Sumonto is his son. She urges him to keep their relationship a secret, but he vows to get his wife and son back. On the day Prachi and Proteek are to marry, the latter stops the wedding and says that he knows the truth about Milind. Milind and Prachi reunite and return to the Shah house with Sumonto.
Alaap, though married to Sukriti, is having an affair with a woman called Kamya. He tries to keep this from the family but they come to know about it. Meanwhile, it appears that Ayesha has come back with a different name, Gayatri. She is Sumonto's school teacher. Prachi is very confused because she thinks that Gayatri is Ayesha, but Gayatri says she is not. On the other hand, Alaap creates some problem because of which Milind is expected to give 120 crores to some creditors. Milind is very tense. He goes to the creditors and asks for some time. They give him six months to pay the amount. He is asked to sign papers agreeing to give his house as a guarantee to the creditors. They say that they have to wait for their boss to come and sign the papers; it is revealed that the boss is Kamya.
The Shah household is having lots of financial problems. Gayatri gets a job for Prachi; she is very happy. Prachi gets a Ganesha statue and goes to Gayatri's house to give it to her out of gratitude. When Gayatri sees the statue she becomes very tense and cannot bear to look at it. On Prachi and Milind's wedding anniversary, the whole family gives them a surprise party. Gayarti also comes to the party. Prachi brings her to meet Milind. But when Prachi turns towards Gayatri she is surprised to see no one there. Then Gayatri reveals that she is Ayesha's spirit, whom no one but Prachi can see. The spirit tells Prachi that she will get into her body and live as Milind's wife. Prachi begs Ayesha not to do so, but the spirit is adamant.
Ayesha's first target in the family is Prachi's grandmother, who is nearly killed. Then the spirit makes Prachi befriend Kamya, which upsets Sukriti. Ayesha's spirit is ruining Prachi's life. Meanwhile, Alaap begins to change for the better. Sukriti decides to kill herself because of everything that has happened, but she is saved by her friend Raghav. Alaap feels jealous because of Sukriti and Raghav's close friendship.
An elderly female relative, called Bua by everyone, visits Milind and Prachi. She is a very religious person. She keeps getting a feeling that something is wrong with Prachi. So she tells Milind to take Prachi away from the family for a few days. Milind tells Prachi that he wants to take her out for dinner and she agrees. By the time Milind arrives to pick up Prachi, Ayesha's ghost has entered her body. Prachi, with Ayesha's ghost inside her, behaves suspiciously. Milind takes her out to Shimla on a holiday. Meanwhile, Bua figures out that someone is hypnotizing Prachi, causing the odd behaviour. Finally, it turns out that Neev's father Pranay Shergill is the culprit. Pranay had earlier killed Inder Shah. Now he is hypnotizing Prachi with the help of black magic because he wants to have Milind killed at her hands. However, with Bua's help, Milind foils Pranay's plans. Pranay gets sentenced in the court, while Milind and Prachi live happily.

Bring Back the Wild.
Almost unanimously, children identify the crisis facing animals as their number one environmental concern and they are passionate about taking action to protect species and their habitats. In response to this, Earth Rangers developed Bring Back the Wild. The goal of this program is simple yet critical – to educate and inspire children about biodiversity loss in an engaging and interactive format and provide tools to help children protect animals at risk of extinction across Canada. 
Each year, Bring Back the Wild focuses on four unique Canadian species that need help, as well as the Woodland Caribou as a special project during the holiday season. Four new projects are introduced in conjunction with each new school year. To participate, children log onto www.earthrangers.com where they learn about the different conservation projects and select the specific animal they would like to help protect through an online fundraising campaign. Since launching Bring Back the Wild in September 2010, over 200,000 children have participated.
Earth Rangers membership.
By becoming a member of Earth Rangers, children, with support from their families, make a commitment to engage in actions that directly contribute to the protection of wildlife. Members will receive their own personalized membership card and welcome package. Their first mission as an official Earth Ranger is to complete a Bring Back the Wild fundraising campaign to help save an animal. Once the campaign is complete, members will receive updates on BBtW projects and additional missions they can do at home that encourage environmentally responsible behaviours. Earth Rangers' aim is to remind children and their families that small actions, when made by many, can have a huge impact.
School outreach.
The School Outreach Program is Earth Rangers’ longest running program and features live animal ambassadors demonstrating their amazing, natural behaviours. The presentation communicates a positive, science-based message about the importance of protecting the environment and adopting more sustainable behaviours. The program visits 550 schools each year across Canada.
To enhance what students have learned during the school assembly, Earth Rangers created a Classroom Visit Program, that meets the environmental science curriculum requirements for students in grades 4 to 6. The program has been developed in collaboration with leading institutions including the Toronto Zoo, Royal Ontario Museum (ROM), and Vancouver Aquarium.
In the community.
Earth Rangers attends a number of community events each year and has a permanent studio at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario where shows are hosted throughout the year including special presentations during the holiday period in December and March break. Earth Rangers also has a national television presence on YTV.
Online.
EarthRangers.com is the largest online environmental community for kids in Canada and the ideal destination for kids interested in conservation and biodiversity. The website features over 25 environmentally themed games, videos about species in the wild and environmental news, interviews and fun facts about animals on the Wild Wire Blog.
Animal ambassadors.
Earth Rangers believes in the power of animals to help inspire and engage children in environmental issues. Children have a natural connection with animals and Earth Rangers’ goal is to foster this connection through educational programs. Providing children with the opportunity to see wild animals up close inspires children to champion environmental issues either through their own actions or through a Bring Back the Wild fundraising campaign. Over 40 animals live at the Earth Rangers Centre and are incorporated into educational programming. 
Building.
The Earth Rangers Centre (ERC) is an advanced green building, certified Platinum under LEED for Existing Buildings and Gold under New Construction. The ERC was designed to embody Earth Rangers’ values, to show that the organization practices what it preaches, and to serve as inspiration to everyone who walks through its doors.
The ERC is located in Woodbridge, Ontario, on the grounds of the Kortright Centre for Conservation. It is home to Earth Rangers’ staff and animal ambassadors, and is a showcase of leading edge sustainable building technology including energy metering, smart automation and controls, innovative water and wastewater management, solar generation, green roofs, and geothermal heating and cooling. The ERC is proof that a building can operate effectively and efficiently, while minimizing the impact on the environment.
Ventiliation.
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first buildings in Canada to use displacement ventilation and has the largest installation of earth tubes in North America. This ventilation system circulates air through diffusers located near the floor level and displaces the existing air into return ducts near the ceiling. 
Data Centre.
The Earth Rangers’ 9.3 square metre (100 ft2) data centre was completed in December 2008. The data room uses storage servers from Pillar, Dell’s processing servers and virtual personal machines using VMware’s View software. Nortel’s Power over Ethernet (PoE) switching facilitates the transfer of electrical power and data across the infrastructure. Earth Rangers also participates in Compugen’s Green4Good program which works to combat the environmental impact of end-of-life technology products and support charities in need.
Solar electricity.
The Earth Rangers Centre has two solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays in operation; both convert the sun’s rays into standard voltage to be used by the building’s systems. In the Earth Rangers Centre parking lot there is a 57.6 kWp dual-axis tracking array on six separate posts consisting of 54 Solgate 175 W panels, provided by Sentinel Power Systems. Each array follows the sun from east to west during the day, increasing output by up to 30 per cent over a fixed panel. Each panel has its own micro-inverter, further increasing the efficiency of the arrays, and allowing real-time monitoring of the system on panel by panel basis. The second array is located on the aviary this building boasts a 28.08 kWp, designed and installed by Enviro-Energy Technologies Inc, it offsets approximately 10 per cent of the Earth Rangers Centre’s annual needs.
Heating and cooling.
The Earth Rangers Centre was one of the first 100 per cent radiant heated and cooled buildings in North America. The building uses 22 kilometres of REHAU radiant tubing, which was laid within the concrete floors and ceiling. The flow of a non-toxic, vegetable-based liquid (water/glycol) through these tubes causes the concrete to become thermally activated. In the warm seasons, cooled liquid is supplied to the concrete slabs. The heat from the computers, people and the sun is absorbed by the concrete, causing the cooled liquid in the tubing to warm up. The liquid is then cooled by rejecting heat to the ground source system or free cooled by directly coupling to our cooling tower. In the colder months, the glycol is warmed by the ground source heat pump before it is supplied to the slab system.

Lewis Paul

Lewis Paul (died 1759) was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill.
Life and work.
Lewis Paul was of Huguenot descent. His father was physician to Lord Shaftesbury. He may have begun work on designing a spinning machine for cotton as early as 1729, but probably did not make practical progress until after 1732 when he met John Wyatt, a carpenter then working in Birmingham for a gun barrel forger. Wyatt had designed a machine, probably for cutting files, in which Paul took an interest.
Roller spinning was certainly Paul's idea, and Wyatt built a machine (or model) for him. Paul obtained a patent for this on 24 June 1738. He then set about trying to license his machine, though some licenses were granted in satisfaction of debts. In 1741, he set up a machine powered by two asses in the Upper Priory in Birmingham, near his house in Old Square.
Mills using the roller spinning patent.
Edward Cave, a publisher, obtained a licence and set up machines in a warehouse in London. In 1742, he acquired Marvel's Mill on the River Nene at Northampton. He rebuilt the mill to hold four or five water-powered spinning machines, each with 50 spindles. This was thus the first cotton mill. Cave died on 10 January 1754, so that the mill passed to his brother William and his nephew Paul. Samuel Touchet, a London merchant had the mill until 1755, but made no profit. It may then have been let to Lewis Paul, but he died in 1759. The Caves forfeited the lease for non-payment of rent in March 1761 and advertised the mill to let in November 1761. By 1768, the mill had reverted to being a corn mill.
Another mill that operated under Paul's patent was at Leominster. This was built in 1744 by John Bourn in partnership with Henry Morris of Lancashire. Unfortunately, this mill burnt down in November 1754.
Carding machines.
In 1748, Daniel Bourn and Lewis Paul separately obtained patents for carding machines, which were presumably used in the Leominster and Northampton mills respectively. This carding technology of Lewis Paul and Daniel Bourn seems to be the basis of later carding machines.
Achievements.
The principle of his rolling spinning process was perfected by John Kay and Thomas Highs and promoted by Richard Arkwright. Paul's machine seems only to have been modestly profitable, and it is not clear to what extent his work is reflected in Arkwright's much more successful machine, the water frame, patented in 1769. Like Paul and Bourn, Arkwright subsequently added a carding stage to his machinery, but his use of this as a means of continuing his patent rights beyond the expiry of his original patent failed, because the improvement was not his invention.

Ornithoptera paradisea

The Paradise Birdwing ("Ornithoptera paradisea") is a species of birdwing butterfly found in New Guinea.
History.
Arnold Pagenstecher and Staudinger both described this butterfly, under different names and the first description by Staudinger was based on a manuscript sent to him by Pagenstecher who possessed specimens from the collection of D. Wolf von Schönberg in Naumburg who had acquired them from a colonist in the then German New Guinea. Pagenstecher's name is "Schoenbergia schoenbergi" and the year of publication also 1893. Robert Henry Fernando Rippon in his illustrated monograph "Icones Ornithopterorum" (1898 to 1906) attributes the name "paradisea" to both entomologists i.e. as "Ornithoptera paradisea" Pagenstecher and Staudinger.
The holotype is held by Zoologische Staatssammlung München.[http://globis.insects-online.de/species&s=3659]
which also holds the type of "Ornithoptera schoenbergi" Pagenstecher
The specific epithet "paradisea", is the Persian word for Paradise.
Description.
"Ornithoptera paradisea" is a large butterfly with a wingspan ranging from 140 mm to 190 mm. Males and females differ in the size, shape and colour of the wings.
Male: Males have black fore wings. The costal edge is black and there are two large, yellow gold and green bands. The underside of the male forewing is green with black veins and at the apex there is a black area. The hind wings are tiny triangles, golden and with thin tails. The inner edge of the hind wing is black and there is usually a green stripe between the golden area and the inner edge. The outer edge of the hind wing is usually green.The underside is very similar to the upperside but the inner edge is green and hairy. The hindwings have tails of uncertain selective origin.The only other tailed "Ornithoptera" is "Ornithoptera meridionalis".
The abdomen is yellow, the head and thorax are black and green.
Female: "O. paradisea" is strongly sexually dimorphic and the significantly larger female covers the upper range of the wing-span.The basic colour is dark-brown. Two groups of white spots dominate the fore wing and on the hind wings there is a white area with a yellow outer edge. Between these there is a chain of black spots. The underside is very similar to the upperside, but the colours are stronger.
The abdomen is yellow, the head and thorax are black and green.
Biology and life-cycle.
The habitat is lowland or montane primary forest. Adult males fly high around trees rarely descending to the ground. Females fly below the canopy searching for the foodplant which is a species of "Aristolochia" with orange fruits. The male emits a pleasant scent from the fringe of white hairs along the anal vein of the hind wing.
The egg is 4 mm. in diameter and light orange. Eggs are laid singly and are attached to the ventral surface of an "Aristolochia" leaf or a nearby object. The first instar larva is dark red wine colour.Instars 2-5 are velvet black and bear red tubercles with long black tips.The pupa is brown with a bright yellow and orange saddlemark.It has a waxy coating and two short, sharp spurs on abdominal segments 3-6.
The eggs are parasitised by species of Chalcidoidea and the larvae are parasitised by Braconidae. Ants, lizards and birds eat the larvae and pupae and in monsoon the larvae suffer 30% mortality.
The Paradise Birdwing is closely related to "Ornithoptera meridionalis".
Subspecies.
The 2004 revision by Gilles Delisle accepts three subspecies "Troides paradisea paradisea", "Troides paradisea chrysanthemum" and "Troides paradisea arfakensis" Joicey & Noakes, 1915
Conservation.
Supported by World Association of Zoos and Aquariums who claim that Papua New Guinea farmers achieve more income with breeding butterflies for life exhibits in zoos than with cultivation of coffee encourage support for the natural butterfly populations by cultivating food plants. Income is also made from sales to collectors. In his 1983 report to the Department of Primary Industries, Papua New Guinea, M.J. Parsons wrote that "Ironically it is now becoming an accepted fact that the very demand for "Ornithoptera" is one of the main assets which will ensure their future survival if they can be exploited in the correct way."
The Paradise Birdwing is listed on CITES appendix II, limiting the international exportation of the species to those who are granted a permit.

Burnside Hall

Burnside Hall is a thirteen-floor building on downtown campus of McGill University in Montreal. It is named after the Montreal estate of James McGill, the university's founder.
Design.
The second tallest building on the McGill Campus, Burnside Hall was completed in 1970. It was designed in the Brutalist style, by Marshall, Merrett and Associates. Many McGill students consider the building to be ugly as a result of its very simple "totalitarian" design, and the gradually decaying cement.
Faculties.
Burnside is home to the Department of Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences, the Department of Geography, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, the Network and Communications Services, the Walter Hitschfeld Geographic Information Centre the Edward Rosenthall Mathematics and Statistics Library, and Security Services.
