Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2011

The Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2011 was prompted by Ed Stelmach's announcement that he would not be seeking re-election in the 28th general election and therefore would be resigning as leader of the Progressive Conservatives. With the Progressive Conservatives forming the Alberta government, the winner of the election consequently became Premier of Alberta.
Stelmach provided official notice of resignation on May 27, 2011. The PC Association then announced the timeline of the election, with the nomination deadline on July 15, and the first ballot on September 17. As no candidate had over 50% of the vote, the second ballot, with the top three candidates, took place on October 1, 2011. Upon no candidate receiving over 50% on that ballot, the second preference votes were added, and Alison Redford was declared the leader, after Gary Mar received the most votes on the first and second ballots.
Declared candidates.

MLA for Spruce Grove-Sturgeon-St. Albert since 2001. Served in the cabinet from 2004 to 2011.

Results.
First ballot.
The first ballot was on September 17, 2011.
Two days following the first ballot, Morton and Orman decided to endorse Mar. Griffiths followed the next day.
Second ballot.
A preferential ballot was cast on October 1, 2011. Because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote on the first count, the third place finisher was dropped, and the second preference votes cast on Horner's ballots were counted and added to the remaining candidate's totals. Mar led after the first round, and Horner was eliminated. After second preferences were applied, Redford was declared the winner.

Bermuda Volunteer Engineers

The Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was a part-time unit created between the two world wars to replace the Regular Royal Engineers detachment, which was withdrawn from the Bermuda Garrison in 1928.
History.
The Military Garrison in Bermuda.
From 1885 to 1928, the only Bermudian units within the garrison were part-time infantry and artillery soldiers, the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps and the Bermuda Militia Artillery, respectively. Each unit had been created under a separate Act of the colonial parliament, at the prompting of the Secretary of State for War, in London. A third act had also been passed authorising the creation of a volunteer engineering unit of sappers and miners. This was intended to work with the regular soldiers of the Royal Engineers and the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) in tending to submarine mines anchored around Bermuda (this was only one of the activities the Royal Engineers were involved in, as they were also engaged in large scale building work). The volunteer engineers would have operated boats from the RAOC wharf on East Broadway, on the outskirts of Hamilton, however the unit was never actually raised.
During the First World War, in addition to fulfilling their roles as guardians of Bermuda and its important Imperial defence assets (such as the Royal Naval Dockyard), each of these units sent two contingents to the Western Front. Numerous other Bermudians served in other regiments and corps of the British Army, as well as in the Royal Navy and the new Royal Air Force.
Large numbers of regular infantry and artillery soldiers, plus various supporting units, had been stationed in Bermuda since the early 19th Century, but the UK Government had been trying to reduce the expense of maintaining garrisons around the world, following the Crimean War, by encouraging the raising of volunteer units in the various colonies and protectorates. This had led to the creation of the two Bermudian units, and the size of the regular forces in Bermuda was steadily reduced from about 1870 onward.
In May, 1928, the regular infantry battalion on garrison was reduced to a single company, and the Royal Garrison Artillery and Royal Engineers detachments withdrawn entirely. The existing volunteer units were able to take on the duties of the first two groups, but the creation of a new volunteer unit was necessary to fulfil those the third.
Creation of the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers.
The Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was created in 1930. Its original strength was one captain, one subaltern, three sergeants, four corporals, and twenty-four sappers. Its original role was to operate the search lights at coastal artillery batteries. The only battery left in active use by that time was the Examination Battery at St. David's Head, the guns of which were manned by the BMA.
The first commanding officer of the BVE was Captain H.D. (later Sir Harry) Butterfield, and the second-in-command was Lieutenant Cecil Montgomery-Moore, DFC. Both were veterans of the First World War (Montgomery-Moore had served in the BVRC before taking a commission as a fighter pilot in the Royal Flying Corps). In 1932, Butterfield retired, and Montgomery-Moore succeeded him. The new 2-i-c was Lieutenant Nicholas Bayard Dill (later Sir Bayard), a son of Colonel Thomas Melville Dill (a former commander of the BMA).
The BVE subsequently also took on responsibility for providing signals crew and equipment to all elements of the garrison.
Second World War.
The BVE, and the other part-time units, were mobilised at the start of the Second World War, fulfilling its role to the Garrison throughout the war. Some members also were detached for service overseas with other units, including the Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force. These included four Sappers who were attached to a larger BVRC contingent despatched to the Lincolnshire Regiment in June, 1940.
Another was Captain Richard Gorham, DFC. Commissioned from the ranks, he was detached from the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers to travel to England to train as an Air Observation Post pilot-an aerial artillery spotter. He had been involved in directing artillery fire as part of his role in the BVE, but had to transfer into the Royal Artillery for this new role. Serving in Italy, he played the decisive role in the Battle of Monte Cassino when he spotted a German division moving in half-tracked German Armoured Personnel Carriers to counter attack against the British and Polish army units which were attacking the German-occupied monastery. Gorham controlled the fire of two-thousand field guns, which fired for hours, destroying the German division. Gorham received the Distinguished Flying Cross for this action.
In Bermuda, Montgomery-Moore was promoted to Major in 1940, and Bayard Dill to Captain. In addition to his role with the BVE, Montgomery-Moore also headed the Bermuda Flying School, which trained 80 local volunteers as pilots for the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm. Volunteers were only accepted from those already serving in the local forces, some of whom came from the BVE.
Disbandment.
The BVE, as with all of the local volunteer units, was demobilised in 1946 following the end of the war. Whereas the BVRC and the BMA maintained skeleton command structures until they began recruiting again in 1951, the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers was officially disbanded.

Pryse Lockhart Gordon

Pryse Lockhart Gordon (24 April 1762 – 2 September 1845), was a Scottish writer of memoirs.
Life.
Gordon was born 24 April 1762 at Ardersier, Inverness-shire, where his father, the Rev. Harry Gordon, was minister of the parish. After his father's death (15 March 1764) his mother went to live with her father, the Revd Walter Morrison, in Banffshire. Young Gordon was educated at the parish school of Banff, and subsequently at the University of Aberdeen, where he did not remain long, obtaining a commission in the marines at the age of fifteen. He was principally employed in recruiting, and seems to have seen no active service except a few cruises, which yielded him, he says, £17 in prize-money. In 1792 he obtained a commission in a regiment raised by the Duke of Gordon, and after five years' service in Scotland was allowed to accompany his friend Lord Montgomery, an invalid, to Italy, where he remained until 1801, returning to find his regiment disbanded.
He obtained employment at Minorca; but as he was on the point of embarking, 'my good fortune threw in my way an amiable young widow', whom he married in autumn 1801. This rendered him independent of military service. After living at Banff Castle and in Sloane Street, London, he went to Sicily with Lord Montgomery in 1811, and remained there until 1813, when he was prostrated by a sunstroke. The following year, after the peace, he took up his residence at Brussels, where he remained until his death. He died in Cheltenham on 2 September 1845.
Writings.
In 1823 Gordon wrote a guide for travellers, entitled "A Companion to Italy", the success of which led to the appearance of his "Personal Memoirs" in 1830. This contained reminiscences of notable persons known to the author, including Lady Hamilton, George Brydges Rodney, Richard Porson, Charles Burney, and James Perry of the "Morning Chronicle". It sketches picture and antiquity hunting, at a time when bargains were to be had, and connoisseurs were liable to be imposed upon. Gordon himself obtained for Burney the copy of Constantine Lascaris's "Grammar", the first Greek book printed, which went to the British Museum. There is a description of the English at Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo. His reminiscences of Rodney asserted that Rodney, upon his return to England, volunteered to Gordon an acknowledgment of his acquaintance with Clerk of Eldin's essay on naval tactics, and his indebtedness to it. In 1834 Gordon published "Holland and Belgium", with notes on the Belgian Revolution and its causes.

Two of his sons were slain at the Battle of Worcester 3 September 1651; the elder, Henry, had been knighted on the field there. The family's losses amounted, it is said, to 10,000l. In June 1661 two other sons, Philip and John, were obliged to petition for places as pages to the queen ‘to lessen the charges of their mother, who was brought very low by the late times’. The petition was granted. These appointments and the present of a portrait of Charles I are said to have been the only recompense the family received. In the chancel of Kirkoswald Church is a monument to the memory of Sir Timothy erected by his grandson Thomas. His portrait is given in the frontispiece of William Winstanley's ‘The Loyall Martyrology,’ 1665, from which an enlarged engraving was published in octavo.

Active zone

The active zone or synaptic active zone is a term first used by Couteaux and Pecot-Dechavassinein in 1970 to define the site of neurotransmitter release. Two neurons make contact through structures called synapses allowing them to communicate with each other. As shown in the diagram on the right, a synapse consists of the presynaptic bouton of one neuron which stores vesicles containing neurotransmitter (uppermost in the picture) and a second, postsynaptic neuron which bears receptors for the neurotransmitter (at the bottom). When an action potential reaches the presynaptic bouton, the contents of the vesicles are released into the synaptic cleft and the released neurotransmitter travels across the cleft to the postsynaptic neuron (the lower structure in the picture) and activates the receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
The active zone is the region in the presynaptic bouton that mediates neurotransmitter release and is composed of the presynaptic membrane and a dense collection of proteins called the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ). The CAZ is seen under the electron microscope to be a dark (electron dense) area close to the membrane. Proteins within the CAZ tether synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic membrane and mediate synaptic vesicle fusion, thereby allowing neurotransmitter to be released reliably and rapidly when an action potential arrives.
Function.
The function of the active zone is to ensure that neurotransmitters can be reliably released in a specific location of a neuron and only released when the neuron fires an action potential.
As an action potential propagates down an axon it reaches the axon terminal called the presynaptic bouton. In the presynaptic bouton, the action potential activates calcium channels (VDCCs) that cause a local influx of calcium. The increase in calcium is detected by proteins in the active zone and forces vesicles containing neurotransmitter to fuse with the membrane. This fusion of the vesicles with the membrane releases the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft (space between the presynaptic bouton and the postsynaptic membrane). The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the cleft and bind to ligand gated ion channels and G-protein coupled receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. The binding of neurotransmitters to the postsynaptic receptors then induces a change in the postsynaptic neuron. The process of releasing neurotransmitters and binding to the postsynaptic receptors to cause a change in the postsynaptic neuron is called neurotransmission.
Structure.
The active zone is present in all chemical synapses examined so far and is present in all animal species. The active zones examined so far have at least two features in common, they all have protein dense material that project from the membrane and tethers synaptic vesicles close to the membrane and they have long filamentous projections originating at the membrane and terminating at vesicles slightly farther from the presynaptic membrane. The protein dense projections vary in size and shape depending on the type of synapse examined. One striking example of the dense projection is the ribbon synapse (see below) which contains a "ribbon" of protein dense material that is surrounded by a halo of synaptic vesicles and extends perpendicular to the presynaptic membrane and can be as long as 500 nm! The glutamate synapse contains smaller pyramid like structures that extend about 50 nm from the membrane. The neuromuscular synapse contains two rows of vesicles with a long proteinaceous band between them that is connected to regularly spaced horizontal ribs extending perpendicular to the band and parallel with the membrane. These ribs are then connected to the vesicles which are each positioned above a peg in the membrane (presumably a calcium channel). Previous research indicated that the active zone of glutamatergic neurons contained a highly regular array of pyramid shaped protein dense material and indicated that these pyramids were connected by filaments. This structure resembled a geometric lattice where vesicles were guided into holes of the lattic. This attractive model has come into question by recent experiments. Recent data shows that the glutamatergic active zone does contain the dense protein material projections but these projections were not in a regular array and contained long filaments projecting about 80 nm into the cytoplasm.
There are at least five major scaffold proteins that are enriched in the active zone; UNC13/Munc13, RIMs (Rab3-interacting molecule), Bassoon, Piccolo/aczonin, ELKS, and liprins-α. These scaffold proteins are thought to be the constituents of the dense pyramid like structures of the active zone and are thought to bring the synaptic vesicles into close proximity to the presynaptic membrane and the calcium channels. The protein ELKS binds to the cell adhesion protein, β-neurexin, and other proteins within the complex such as Piccolo and Bassoon. β-neurexin then binds to cell adhesion molecule, neuroligin located on the postsynaptic membrane. Neuroligin then interacts with proteins that bind to postsynaptic receptors. Protein interactions like that seen between Piccolo/ELKS/β-neurexin/neuroligin ensures that machinery that mediates vesicle fusion is in close proximity to calcium channels and that vesicle fusion is adjacent to postsynaptic receptors. This close proximity vesicle fusion and postsynaptic receptors ensures that there is little delay between the activation of the postsynaptic receptors and the release of neurotransmitters.
Neurotransmitter release mechanism.
The release of neurotransmitter is accomplished by the fusion of neurotransmitter vesicles to the presynaptic membrane. Although the details of this mechanism are still being studied there is a consensus on some details of the process. Synaptic vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane is known to require a local increase of calcium from as few as a single, closely associated calcium channels and the formation of highly stable SNARE complexes. One prevailing model of synaptic vesicle fusion is that SNARE complex formation is catalyzed by the proteins of the active zone such as Munc18, Munc13, and RIM. The formation of this complex is thought to "prime" the vesicle to be ready for vesicle fusion and release of neurotransmitter (see below: releasable pool). After the vesicle is primed then complexin binds to the SNARE complex this is called "superprimed." The vesicles that are superprimed are within the readily releasable pool (see below) and are ready to be rapidly released. The arrival of an action potential opens voltage gated calcium channels near the SNARE/complexin complex. Calcium then binds to changes the conformation of synaptotagmin. This change in conformation of allows synaptotagmin to then dislodge complexin, bind to the SNARE complex, and bind to the target membrane. When synaptotagmin binds to both the SNARE complex and the membrane this induces a mechanical force on the membrane so that it causes the vesicle membrane and presynaptic membrane to fuse. This fusion opens a membrane pore that releases the neurotransmitter. The pore increases in size until the entire vesicle membrane is indistinguishable from the presynaptic membrane.
Synaptic vesicle cycle.
The presynaptic bouton has an efficiently orchestrated process to fuse vesicles to the presynaptic membrane to release neurotransmitters and regenerate neurotransmitter vesicles. This process called the synaptic vesicle cycle maintains the number of vesicles in the presynaptic bouton and allows the synaptic terminal to be an autonomous unit. The cycle begins with (1) a region of the golgi apparatus is pinched off to form the synaptic vesicle and this vesicle is transported to the synaptic terminal. At the terminal (2) the vesicle is filled with neurotransmitter. (3) The vesicle is transported to the active zone and docked in close proximity to the plasma membrane. (4) During an action potential the vesicle is fuses with the membrane, releases the neurotransmitter and allows the membrane proteins previously on the vesicle to diffuse to the peri-active zone. (5) In the peri-active zone the membrane proteins are sequestered and are endocytosed forming a clathrin coated vesicle. (6) The vesicle is then filled with neurotransmitter and is then transported back to the active zone.
The endocytosis mechanism is slower than the exocytosis mechanism. This means that in intense activity the vesicle in the terminal can become depleted and no longer available to be released. To help prevent the depletion of synaptic vesicles the increase in calcium during intense activity can activate calcineurin which dephosphorylate proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Vesicle pools.
The synapse contains at least two clusters of synaptic vesicles, the readily releasable pool and the reserve pool. The readily releasable pool is located within the active zone and connected directly to the presynaptic membrane while the reserve pool is clustered by cytoskeletal and is not directly connected to the active zone.
Releasable pool.
The releasable pool is located in the active zone and is bound directly to the presynaptic membrane. It is stabilized by proteins within the active zone and bound to the presynaptic membrane by SNARE proteins. These vesicles are ready to release by a single action potential and are replenished by vesicles from the reserve pool. The releasable pool is sometimes subdivided into the readily releasable pool and the releasable pool.
Reserve Pool.
The reserve pool is not directly connected to the active zone. The increase in presynaptic calcium concentration activates the calcium sensitive phosphatase, calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates a protein, synapsin, that mediates the clustering of the reserve pool vesicles. Dephosphorylation of synapsin mobilize vesicles in the reserve pool and allows the vesicles to migrate to the active zone and replenish the readily releasable pool.
Periactive zone.
The periactive zone surrounds the active zone and is the site of endocytosis of the presynaptic terminal. In the periactive zone, scaffolding proteins such as intersectin 1 recruit proteins that mediate endocytotis such as dynamin, clathrin and endophilin. In "Drosophilia" the intersectin homolog, Dap160, is located in the periactive zone of the neuromuscular junction and mutant Dap160 deplete synaptic vesicles during high frequency stimulation.
Ribbon Synapse Active Zone.
The ribbon synapse is a special type of synapse found in sensory neurons such as photoreceptor cells, retinal bipolar cells, and hair cells. Ribbon synapses contain a dense protein structure that tethers an array of vesicles perpendicular to the presynaptic membrane. In an electron micrograph it appears as a ribbon like structure perpendicular to the membrane. Unlike the 'traditional' synapse, ribbon synapses can maintain a graded release of vesicles. In other words the more depolarized a neuron the higher the rate of vesicle fusion. The Ribbon synapse active zone is separated into two regions, the archiform density and the ribbon. The archiform density is the site of vesicle fusion and the ribbon stores the releasable pool of vesicles. The ribbon structure is composed primarily of the protein RIBEYE, about 64-69% of the ribbon volume, and is tethered to the archiform density by scaffolding proteins such as Bassoon.
Measuring Neurotransmitter Release.
Neurotransmitter release can be measured by determining the amplitude of the postsynaptic potential after triggering an action potential in the presynaptic neuron. Measuring neurotransmitter release this way can be problematic because the effect of the postsynaptic neuron to the same amount of released neurotransmitter can change over time. Another way is to measure vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane directly using a patch pipette. A cell membrane can be thought of as a capacitor in that positive and negative ions are stored on both sides of the membrane. The larger the area of membrane the more ions that are necessary to hold the membrane at a certain potential. In electrophysiology this means that a current injection into the terminal will take less time to charge a membrane to a given potential before vesicle fusion than it will after vesicle fusion. The time course to charge the membrane to a potential and the resistance of the membrane is measured and with these values the capacitance of the membrane can be calculated by the equation Tau/Resistance=Capacitance. With this technique researchers can measure synaptic vesicle release directly by measuring increases in the membrane capacitance of the presynaptic terminal.

AIMstor

Cofio AIMstor is a software product developed by Cofio Software. Cofio described the product as a Data management product with a feature set particularly tailored to Backup, Replication and Archiving.
Product Philosophy.
The premise behind AIMstor is that it provides a solution where the core functionality for all the key features (backup, replication, CDP , archiving) is part of the base install sharing common code and that different features may be chained together seamlessly. 
To understand the essence of AIMstor it is probably easier to understand how it strives to represent the method of defining a solution to the user. 
The core of the configuration and the ethos of AIMstor is defining two things, Policies and Data Flow. Policies define data classifications (type of data) and the operations (backup, replication, CDP, etc) that should be applied to those classifications. 
Data Flow allows you to define physical topologies where you define where policies are assigned and how data flows through that topology. Both Policy definition and Data Flow definition are done graphically.
Once the definition has been created, it is compiled into individual rules that are distributed to different machines in the topology. The rules define each machines role in implementing the policies. The rules may hence define the source machine to collect data defined by the policies and forward it to a machine. The receiving machine may store it and / or forward it to another machine.
A departure to other products is that each core function was designed to work in conjunction with each other. This means that if data in a classification may only need to be picked up once regardless if there are several operations applied to it (backup, archiving, replication etc). 
The stated benefit of the architecture is that it reduces complexity because multiple operations can be defined in one policy and that it decreases the overhead.
Architecture.
AIMstor has a distributed architecture where every machine is a Node. Each Node can serve one of several roles. 
Each environment will only have one AIMstor Master. The Master is responsible administrating an AIMstor system only and is not responsible for storing or transferring data directly.

The genomics sector innovation network portal was developed to highlight and support the genomics sector in Ontario and was created by the Ontario Genomics Institute.
What is Genomics?
Genomics is the holistic, systematic, and high-throughput characterization of genomes—the full complement of DNA underlying the genetic make-up of a given organism. Though smaller genomes had been previously completely sequenced, the consideration of the possibility of doing so for the entire human genome crystallized the notion of a new paradigm for the life sciences, intended to enable and accelerate traditional hypothesis-driven research.
Genomics has since been generalized to capture the application of this approach (holistic, systematic and high-throughput) to any and all aspects of life sciences, but many of these applications have also stimulated the coining of a much broader vocabulary of "omics" applications, for example: functional genomics (the characterization of the cellular functions of the genome's genes and proteins for which they code); proteomics (the characterization of all the kinds of proteins for which the genome codes); metabolomics (the characterization of all the metabolites in an organism); transcriptomics (the characterization of all transcribed RNA molecules within an organism); epigenomics (the characterization of all epigenetic modifications to the genome); and glycomics (the characterization of all the kinds of polysaccharide polymers attached to other macromolecules in an organism).
Genomics - and the scale, scope and strategy it brings to life sciences research - has emerged as an important, complementary alternative to traditional approaches to R&D. It is, on the one hand, focused on gaining insight, at the molecular level, into genes and the proteins for which they code; and, on the other hand, reflects a new scientific paradigm for life sciences research that came into play over the past decade and which is blossoming as we move into the 21st century.
The growth of genomics and the resulting boom in technology development have created a tremendous global impact on our knowledge and understanding of the molecular basis of life. This impact ranges from drug and pesticide discovery to industrial enzymology, to crop and livestock cultivation, to environmental remediation, to natural resource management, and to criminal and civil law. This impact of these changes in technological underpinnings has also been reflected in other sectors focused more on societal implications, including public policy, education, journalism, fine arts, and entertainment.
Genomics in Ontario.
The genomics sector in Ontario consists of the individuals, institutions, and associations—a sub-set of the province's life-sciences industry—who are working:
This industry includes universities and private research institutions, individual and institutional investors, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and related companies, and the various public and private institutions devoted to servicing and supporting these enterprises.
There are more than 500 scientists conducting research in genomics located at 20 universities, research institutions, hospitals and government laboratories across the province. These individuals are generating genomics discoveries and innovations as well as using genomic tools and products.

List of Olympic venues in sailing

For the Summer Olympics, there are 32 venues that have been or will be used for sailing. Most competitions took place for the early part of the Olympics at or near venues, but no specific yacht or sailing club was listed in the official Olympic report. In 1920, the twelve-foot dinghy event set for Ostend was moved to the Netherlands at special request of the Belgian Olympic Committee. The first specific yacht or sailing club to host the competitions took place in 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City though those competitions took place actually in Acapulco. Eight years later in Montreal, the competitions took place on the Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario, marking the first and only time the sailing competitions took place in freshwater.
During the fifth race of the 1988 Summer Olympic sailing Finn event near Busan, Canada's Lawrence Lemieux was in second place when he noticed Joseph Chan of Singapore in the water from his capsized boat. Lemieux abandoned his position and rescued Chan and Chan's Singapore teammate. Even though Lemieux finished last in the race, the IOC gave him second place for the race as a result of Lemieux's heroic efforts. Lemieux would be awarded the IOC Pierre de Coubertin medal at the Finn medal awards ceremony by President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
The 1992 Summer Olympic venue was noted for its numerous complaints from the sailors over the debris found at the Olympic Harbor. Among the items found were dead rats and floating refrigerators. It was so bad that Barcelona port authorities, under pressure from the International Yacht Racing Union (International Sailing Federation since August 1996), assigned four garbage vessels to collect garbage daily. In the men's windsurfer event, American Mike Gebhardt got a plastic bag caught on his boardsail in the last lap of the seventh race. Six boardsailers passed Gebhardt before he could dislodge the plastic bag. Gebhardt lost out a gold by 0.4 points over France's Franck David.

Disability in Sierra Leone

Disability in Sierra Leone – according to the World Health Organization, an estimated 15% of the world’s population experience some form of disability or impairment. The proportion of disabled people is much higher in Sierra Leone, a Western African country which had emerged from a decade-long civil war back in 2002 where the trademark of the rebel groups was to hack off the limbs of civilians. 
It is estimated that there are about 450,000 disabled people in Sierra Leone. This number could well be an under-representation. The disabled include the blind, deaf, war wounded, amputees and people suffering from polio.
Socioeconomics of the disabled.
In a 2009 study of disability in Sierra Leone, one third of the disabled people surveyed were employed while twice as many disabled people (16.4%) had no access to healthcare as compared to non-disabled people (7.1%). In addition, according to the United Nations Development Programme, 35% of Sierra Leone’s population above 15 years of age is educated and the statistic is even lower for that with disabilities. Poor people are also more at risk of acquiring a disability due to a lack of access to sanitation as well as a safe living and working environment.
Mental health.
Mental healthcare in Sierra Leone is almost non-existant. Many sufferers try to cure themselves with the help of traditional healers. During the Civil War (1991–2002), many soldiers took part in atrocities and many children were forced to fight. This left them traumatised, with an estimated 400,000 people (by 2009) being mentally ill. Thousands of former child soldiers have fallen into substance abuse as they try to blunt their memories. 
Government assistance to the disabled.
Currently, the government of Sierra Leone does not provide any assistance to the disabled. According to Bentry Kalanga, the senior programme manager of Africa for SOS Children, an international charity organization, “Disability has not been regarded as a major development issue up to now and it must be highlighted more.”

<doc id="31153498" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31153498" title="Seven Bar Foundation">
Seven Bar Foundation

The Seven Bar Foundation is a social enterprise that uses cause marketing initiatives and the luxury lingerie industry to consistently fuel microfinance and benefit underprivileged women around the world. It is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based out of New York, New York that raises funds for microfinance institutions (MFI's) to enable women to spearhead their own businesses and rise out of poverty.
Model.
The Seven Bar Foundation is a social enterprise, a non-profit that uses business models for social impact. The Foundation relies on commercial markets to fuel a consistent revenue stream instead of relying on unpredictable and limited donor funding. Seven Bar aligns cause with product, utilizing the European lingerie industry as a marketing platform to reach a critical mass of consciousness, empowering women by providing funding to start their own businesses.
History.
Seven Bar is a third-generation family involved in general aviation, real estate development and investments established in New Mexico beginning in the 1950s. Seven Bar and the Black family established the Seven Bar Foundation in 2001 with activities in eight states, contributing to community development projects in each.
Logo.
Seven Bar Foundation is a business model for social impact. It is the brand for microfinance with its pink bars in the logo representing a "ladder" – an exit strategy out of poverty for women. The ladder is to microfinance very much like what the pink ribbon is to breast cancer. The concept is based on the eighth step of Maimonides' Golden Ladder, "To prevent poverty by teaching a trade, setting up a person in business, or in some other way preventing the need of charity."
Renata M. Black.
Renata Mutis Black has established herself as a philanthropist and humanitarian through her commitment to eliminating poverty. She has fought poverty in twelve different countries, working with terminally disabled children in Hong Kong, mentally disabled elders in New Zealand, and victims of the 2004 tsunami in India. The events of the 2004 tsunami centralized her vision towards microfinance.
Black and her husband narrowly evaded the destruction of the tsunami when their flight to Thailand was cancelled due to a mechanical failure. After the disaster, Black immediately went to help rebuild the villages shattered by the catastrophic flooding. During this project, a woman from the region approached her and said, "I know you have money and I don't want it, but why don't you teach me how to make it myself?" This encounter sparked a new course for Black, who immersed herself in study on microloans and its impact on impoverished communities with 2006 Nobel Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus. Black then applied her training by establishing a grassroots microfinance endeavor in India that exists to this day.
Having witnessed first-hand the transformative force of microfinance through her program in India, Black redirected the mission of the Seven Bar Foundation to fund these institutions on a consistent and global basis. She found that microfinance presents these women with the tools to create an exit strategy out of poverty and allows them to become self-sufficient down the road.
Events.
Lingerie New York.
Operating on the tagline "empowering women on a g-string rather than a shoestring," Lingerie New York was produced by fashion week regular Lynne O'Neill and showcased the latest collections of lingerie designers Atsuko Kudo and Carine Gilson.

Guests were treated to a three course meal, cocktails by Belvedere and champagne by Moet & Chandon. Lingerie Miami featured a live and silent auction, including a private tour of the Desperate Housewives set in Los Angeles and a kiss with Eva Longoria that sold for $35,000. The event raised over $180,000, funding microloans for 2,233 women, and garnered over 177 million media impressions.
Products.
LipFusion Lip Gloss by Fusion Beauty.
Seven Bar Foundation and Fusion Beauty's "Kiss Away Poverty" campaign launched on September 15, 2009 with Kim Kardashian. For every $29 LipFusion lipgloss sold, $1 of the purchase went to Seven Bar.

In three months, the cause marketing campaign sold 100,667 lip glosses, translating to $100,667 in funds for the Foundation.
Stars of Africa Collection by Royal Asscher.
Royal Asscher Diamond Company partnered with Seven Bar Foundation for Lingerie New York to present their "Stars of Africa Collection" designed by renowned jewelry designer Reena Ahluwalia. The collection consists of rings, pendants, cufflinks and earrings "with diamonds encased in a fluid-filled sapphire dome, which allows them to fall freely, like snowflakes in a snow globe." Prices range from $1,250-$2,250 for the "Shining Stars" line and $5,950-$8,300 for the "Super Stars" line. For each piece sold, 50% of the profits go to the Foundation's microfinance fund.

.NET Compact Framework controls

NET Compact Framework controls is a set of controls for .NET Compact Framework.
Overview.
The Microsoft .NET Compact Framework is a sub-library of .NET framework. It simplifies the mobile application development of smart devices. These are to a large extent limited by the screen size, CPU performance or memory capacity. .NET compact framework takes some of the controls and libraries from .NET framework. Moreover it optimizes them to match the limited options of mobile devices in comparison with PCs.
There are certain criteria of user interface that mobile users demand. While plenty of functions of standard PC or Mac applications add to the user experience, they might decrease the mobile user experience. Mobile screen is usually small. Therefore, the user may often miss click on mobile screen with many buttons. All of the .NET compact framework controls are hence optimized to overcome the possible limits of mobile devices. Third-party controls are also available.
Third-party .NET Compact Framework controls.
Apart from Microsoft other companies exist who produce .NET Compact Framework controls. See External links section below to find out more third-party .NET Compact Framework controls.

Pappy's Puppy

"Pappy's Puppy" is a 1955 Merrie Melodies short starring Sylvester, Butch, and his newborn son. It was animated entirely by Gerry Chiniquy. Mel Blanc provides the vocals; however, aside from whistling, Sylvester doesn't speak in this short.
Plot Summary.
At a hospital, Butch the bulldog paces nervously, waiting for his baby to be born. He does, and Butch faints. Back at home, Butch teaches his new son how to walk, act tough, and bite cats (by practicing on a dummy). One day, the young bulldog is playing with a ball when he wanders upon Sylvester. His training kicks in and he attacks Sylvester, who proceeds to place the small bulldog under a tin can. However, Butch catches Sylvester doing this and exacts revenge by taking Sylvester to a shed and hammering the tin can on his head. Later, Sylvester is walking along while the baby bulldog is biting at his tail. He slaps the bulldog off camera, only for Butch to catch up to him and wallop Sylvester in retaliation. After that, Sylvester reluctantly plays fetch with the baby bulldog and decides to throw the stick into a busy street, hoping the bulldog will be flattened. However, the young bulldog retrieves it successfully. Annoyed, Sylvester prepares to throw it again but Butch sees this and throws the stick into traffic himself, pointing for Sylvester to fetch the stick this time. Sylvester successfully retrieves it amidst heavy traffic, but is run over by a man on a scooter on the sidewalk anyway. Once again, Sylvester plays fetch with the young bulldog again and throws a ball into a doghouse, which Sylvester boards up when the bulldog chases the ball into it. Sylvester plans to drop a lit stick of dynamite into the open hole on the top. However, Butch once again catches Sylvester and places Sylvester over the doghouse instead; Sylvester doesn't hammer out the nails in the boards in time and explodes. In the final set piece of the cartoon, Sylvester sets up a booby trap of a dog bone hooked up to a shotgun. When Butch's son begins tugging on the bone, Butch gives Sylvester a stern look, prompting Sylvester to run over and plug the shotgun hole with his finger so the young bulldog is unharmed, getting his finger shot over and over (including once in the face) as Butch's son tugs. The stork arrives and announces Butch has even more puppies to add to his family. The cartoon ends as Sylvester chases the stork, shooting at him.

<doc id="31153570" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31153570" title="Syracuse and South Bay Railway">
Syracuse and South Bay Railway

The Syracuse and South Bay Railway, also known as the Syracuse and South Bay Electric Railroad, incorporated on May 10, 1900, was an interurban rail that ran from Syracuse, New York, through Cicero to Lower South Bay on the south shore of Oneida Lake, a distance of . 
The railway and the steamer, "Seneca", combined to provide a round trip from Syracuse to Oneida Lake and across the span to the Frenchman's Island picnic area. The running time from the common center of Syracuse, to South Bay took 35 minutes.
In 1907, the company was sold in foreclosure proceedings and merged into the "Beebe syndicate" of railways in Central New York. The name or the road was changed to Syracuse Northern Electric Railway Company by 1917.
History.
The Syracuse and South Bay Railway Company was chartered on April 23, 1900, and incorporated on May 10, 1900. The company built a road from the center of the city of Syracuse northeast to Oneida Lake. The company planned to be in operation by February 1906. 
By January 1905, eighty percent of the grading for of double track had been completed. Additionally, the ties and poles were in the ground and the rails had been ordered.
On October 27, 1905, the first electric trolley car, drawn by a steam locomotive, passed over the Syracuse and South Bay Railway carrying directors and officials of the company. 
Syracusans could travel north to Oswego to Lake Ontario and points in between via the Syracuse, Lake Shore and Northern Railroad to South Bay and Brewerton on Oneida Lake by way of the Syracuse and South Bay Railway. The road ran from Syracuse to South Bay Road, on the southern shore of Oneida Lake.
Operations.
During the planning stages the rolling stock was designated as double-track high speed interurban cars with motors capable of delivering 200 horse power, with 10 open trailer cars to run in conjunction with the larger type. Additionally, 5 box and 5 flat freight cars and 2 electric locomotives of sufficient power to draw a train of 10 trailers. The locomotives were to be used for freight and excursion business. 
By 1905, the Syracuse and South Bay Railway had the contracts for the car bodies of ten motor-equipped cars to the J. G. Brill Company of Philadelphia. The Peckham Manufacturing Company won the truck contract and ten trailers were later ordered. Each of the ten cars delivered cost $5,000. By 1906, the company had ten high speed interurban cars and ten trailers. 
The general office was located at 305 Gridley Building in Syracuse, New York. Repair shops were situated on the westside of the city.
Electric power.
According to an agreement signed in January 1905, the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway Company furnished power for the road. In the planning stages, it was thought that if necessary, additional power could be obtained from the plant of the Syracuse Lighting Company. Eventually, the company, "in common with other traction lines hereabouts will lease Niagara power."
On August 25, 1908, Niagara power was turned into the transmission lines of the railway between the Solvay substation and North Syracuse. A test of the lines between North Syracuse and South Bay was made the following day and once complete the line was opened at once for business. At that time, the "old Lucebaum farmhouse" at South Bay was remodeled into a temporary station.
Company management.
In May 1900, directors of the company included George D. Chapman, James E. Ratchford, Hiram W. Plumb, all of Syracuse and George R. Allen of Cicero.
Officers of the company were president, George D. Chapman; vice-president, Willis B. Burns; secretary, W. R. Kimball; treasurer, Frank L. Barnes; auditor, D. E. Balsby; general manager and purchasing agent, George C. Towle.
In January 1905, Lieutenant Governor W. M. Brown of Pennsylvania, was interested in the company.
By the time the first electric trolley was operational in October 1905, directors and officials included W. B. Burns, L. L. Waters, F. T. Pierson, P. L. Barnes, George T. Skiff, H. W. Plumb, George D. Chapman, George C. Towle, D. E. Balsey, C. P. Hemingway and T. D. MacGregor.
During 1906, directors included; H. R. Plumb, W. R. Kimball, F. T. Pierson, Frank L. Barnes, Willis B. Burns, W. K. Niver, George T. Skiff and L. L. Waters.
E. M. Wharf was hired as an electrical engineer. He also worked in the same capacity for the Syracuse, Lake Shore and Northern Railroad.
By 1908, the company headquarters were located at 500 Onondaga County Savings Bank Building in Downtown Syracuse. F. W. Roebling was vice-president, C. A. Lux was secretary and Willis A. Holden was treasurer.
Financial.
The company had authorized and issued $120,000 of capital stock with a par value of $100 per share. The first mortgage consisted of gold bonds issued for $300,000 due in 1935.
Background.
The route to Oneida Lake took several years of litigation and the involvement of several roadroads, as well as a "sensational failure," before the operation of a single car to South Bay, New York, a popular resort community. For many years it was the "hope of suburban trolley promoters." Early in the 1890s the work of "getting franchises through the town" to South Bay was begun. This process was repeated "again and again" by multiple companies with the hopes of "immediate" railroad construction only to face failure.
Finally, a breakthrough occurred in 1904 when Willard R. Kimball, former president of the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway, finally made some progress in the project. On April 12, 1905, the New York State Railroad Commission gave the Syracuse and South Bay Railroad Company permission to build and the Bay Road Construction Company spent the greater part of the year 1905 on construction of the road. The plans were elaborate and "upon the most liberal scale" incorporated the purchase of summer resort hotels, rights of way and a pleasure park at the lake.
Bay Road Construction company.
Bay Road Construction Company was established to build the road. On January 19, 1906, there was a flood of judgements filed against the construction company which was followed by a year of litigation and strife for control.
By November 1906, "another fight had developed among different factions" of the company and the history of problems dated back to 1905 when legal judgments were filed against the company. The trouble was in regard to foreclosure action of the Lawrence Savings and Trust Company as trustee against the Syracuse and South Bay Railway Company and others. The mortgage in reference totaled $300,000 and covered all property of the Bay Road Construction Company which was called the "Brown mortgage". In defense, attorney for the railway was Louis L. Waters, who represented the directors of the road. The plaintiffs were represented by Ceylon H. Lewis. 
Waters represented the Willard R. Kimball interests and it was known that if Brown won the foreclosure action, "it would leave him in absolute control of the affairs of the road." Both sides "got together some time ago" and arranged a compromise and Kimball was given an option on the road which was "extended from time to time," however, Kimball had not been able to secure the necessary backing to complete the road. The fight put up by the Kimball interests to stave off the trial of the foreclosure suit showed the company was "trying to prevent the Brown faction from going on with the road to the exclusion of the Kimball people."
Litigation ended in the case involving the Syracuse and South Bay Railway and South Bay Construction by late November 1907, in a special term of the New York Supreme Court in the confirmation of the report of Attorney Douglas E. Petit as referee in the case of the Lawrence Savings and Trust Company against the rail. The road was sold to Petit in the foreclosure action and Ceylon H. Lewis stated that Clifford D. Beebe now held $300,000 worth of bonds and 92 coupons. Additionally, Charles S. Averill had 53 coupons and Louis Wallis had 8. Four coupons were missing and could not be accounted for. There were another 27 coupons which had been declared null and void. 
The report showed that Willard R. Kimball had no interest in the road or in anything connected with it. The coupons held by Averill were formerly the property of Kimball which once totaled 80 in number, with 23 null and void. 
Attorney Lewis reported that the referee had received $25,100 as the first payment on the bonds sold. He paid $19,600 in taxes and costs and $1,248 to the Trust company. A trustee of the bonds and the order provided for the payment of $4,500 to Attorneys Lewis and Crowley, who appeared for the Lawrence Savings and Trust Company. The balance was distributed pro rata among the bondholders. 
In early 1907, the road was sold upon mortgage foreclosure and Clifford D. Beebe placed a bid for the property for his Beebe Syndicate. There was no objection to the confirmation of the report of sale and all litigation over the rail appeared to be at an end.
Beebe syndicate.
In February 1907, Clifford D. Beebe, owner of the "Beebe syndicate" of railways in Central New York bought the railroad property at mortgage foreclosure sale at $251,000. Beebe announced that the railway construction would be completed.
By November 1907, the Syracuse and South Bay Electric Railroad Company, successor to Syracuse and South Bay Street Railway Company, with offices at 500 Onondaga County Savings Bank Building, were owners of both the Syracuse and Oneida Lake Electric Railway Company and the Syracuse and South Bay Railway Company. President and general manager was Clifford D. Beebe of Syracuse; vice-president, F. W. Roebiling of Trenton, New Jersey; secretary, C. A. Lux; treasurer, A. K. Hiscock; auditor, W. W. Foster; purchasing agent, H. J. Clark; chief engineer, T. H. Mather all of Syracuse and electrical engineer, R. A. Dyer, Jr. of Newark, New York.
Vacation excursions.
The railway along with the steamer, "Seneca", combined to provide a round trip from Syracuse to Oneida Lake and across the span to Frenchman's Island picnic area. The cost of the trip was 50 cents and there was "no charge for use of island equipment." By 1907, the company owned the park at South Bay and the amusement grounds on both Frenchman Island and Dunham Island at Oneida Lake.
Additionally, there were thrice-weekly excursions to the Thousand Islands and Montreal in Quebec as well as a special trip to Lakeside Park on Owasco Lake, which was called "the prize summer resort of Central New York."
During August 1909, special fares from Syracuse to Sylvan Beach and return cost $1.00 and trips in the reverse direction cost 50 cents. Tickets could be purchased at the Electric Railway Terminal in the Empire Hotel in Clinton Square in Downtown Syracuse or at the Oneida Lake Terminal Company. A new 600 passenger steamer named the "Sagamore" left the South Bay Dock on Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 am and arrived at Sylvan Beach at 12:00 pm. The return trip left Sylvan Beach at 4:30 pm and arrived in South Bay at 6:30 pm. In order to make the connection, travelers had to leave Syracuse on South Bay cars not later than 9:00 am.
By June 1915, the company was advertising their new boat "Jean" that was in trials on Oneida Lake. The boat had recently completed a set of trials on the St. Lawrence River. It had six-cylinders developing 100-horsepower for speed with free width of beam to insure safety. At that time, a special, one day, three part ticket permitting stop over at Brewerton, Frenchman's Island and South Bay on either Saturday or Sunday cost 70 cents. The cars departed from the Electric Railway Terminal to both Brewerton and South Bay as early as 8:50am and late as 8:50pm.
Labor union.
During June 1916, an agreement with the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electrical Railway Employees was offered to workers from Syracuse and South Bay Railway as well as Empire United lines, Auburn and Syracuse Electric Railroad and the Syracuse, Lake Shore and Northern Railroad. Additionally, the Fulton city lines and Oswego city lines were included in the agreement. Attending the conference were H. J. Barrette and Burton Sampson of the Auburn line, Patrick Long and Willis Pickard of the South Bay road and John Manning and Arthur Hubbell of the Lake Shore road.
Syracuse Northern Electric railway.
The rail was formerly the Syracuse and South Bay Railway Company and the name was changed to Syracuse Northern Electric Railway Company by 1917.
South Bay road.
The rail first arrived in North Syracuse in 1907 and it was replaced by the South Bay Road in 1932 on "that straight line to the lake" which opened "yet another path for settlers" with automobiles who "looked for places to live" after World War II.
The last link in the new county highway, built on the roadbed of the abandoned Syracuse and South Bay Railway, was completed in September 1938. The highway was extended at that time from the Syracuse-Brewerton Road, from a point about midway between Mattydale and Pitcher Hall, northeast to South Bay. The final stretch of the road to open was between Syracuse-Brewerton Road and Fay Road near North Syracuse. A section of the highway, at the South Bay end was of concrete construction by late 1938 and the remainder was gravel. The new route cut the distance between Syracuse and South Bay.

Loyalties (1933 film)

Loyalties is a 1933 British drama film directed by Basil Dean and starring Basil Rathbone, Heather Thatcher and Miles Mander. It is based on the John Galsworthy play "Loyalties". 
The film addresses the theme of anti-Semitism. The film was part of an increased trend depicting mistreatment of Jews in British films during the 1930s, tied to the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany, but is unusual in its depiction of prejudice in Britain as most other films were set in a non-British, historical context.
Plot.
While a houseguest at an upper-class gathering, wealthy Jew Ferdinand de Levis is robbed of £1,000 with evidence pointing towards the guilt of another guest, Captain Dancy. Instead of supporting De Levis, the host attempts to hush the matter up and when this fails, he sides with Dancy and subtly tries to destroy de Levis' reputation. When Dancy is later exposed, and commits suicide, de Levis is blamed for his demise.
Production.
The film was the first to be made by Associated Talking Pictures, known later as Ealing Studios, after the breakdown of their arrangement with RKO Pictures. Carol Reed and Thorold Dickinson both worked on the film's production as assistant directors. Edward Carrick designed the film's sets.

Samuel Rayner

Samuel A. Rayner (15 April 1806 – 1879) was an English landscape artist, known for his paintings of buildings and their interiors, including abbeys, churches and old mansions. He achieved the distinction of having a work accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy at only 15 years of age. His wife, Ann Rayner, was an engraver on Ashford Black Marble and six of their children went on to be professional artists.
Biography.
Samuel Rayner was born in 1806 at Colnbrook in Buckinghamshire (now in Berkshire); afterwards the family moved to Marylebone in London where he was possibly trained by his grandfather. By the age of fifteen Rayner was training as a draughtsman with the antiquary John Britton when Rayner had a picture of Malmesbury Abbey accepted by the Royal Academy. A fellow student and artistic influence was George Cattermole.
Samuel Rayner and his wife, Anne Manser Rayner, founded a painting family. In 1823 he eloped with Anne Manser, who was four years older than him and already known as an artist. They married in 1824 and their first child was born in London but he soon died. Six of their children became painters in turn. Rayner's house was a museum in Matlock Bath in the 1830s where Louise, William Henry and Rhoda (Rose) were born. The engraving by Arthur Jewitt illustrated shows Rayner's house in Matlock Back in 1832. There are two extended entrance ways to museums in the picture. The museum on the right was John Mawe's museum whilst on the left was "Vallance's Royal Centre Museum". Vallance and Rayner were in partnership. There is a view of Matlock Bath engraved by Ann Rayner which also shows their house and it is now in Buxton Museum. This engraving was made by Samuel's wife with a diamond on Ashford Black Marble which was mined locally.
Rayner's painting of the 1839 Derby Exhibition which illustrates the early years of what to become Derby Museum and Art Gallery's collections. This painting includes Joseph Wright of Derby's painting which is on the left of the back wall.
Louise Rayner is the best known of Samuel and Ann's children: her siblings were Ann ("Nancy"), Margaret, Rose, Frances, and Richard. Nancy Rayner was influenced by Octavius Oakley and she was the first to be recognised as a distinguished artist but she died of consumption at the age of 28. Samuel was elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1845 but was excluded from the Society in 1851 after a financial scandal. Some of his work can be seen at Derby Museum and Art Gallery.

Ikken hissatsu

During a struggle, levels of epinephrine in the bloodstream are higher than normal, which can generate a false perception of reality, causing injuries to be felt well after its end.
Traditionally, according to various practical applications of kata, karate was modeled so that a person could face more than one opponent simultaneously. However, with the advent of sports karate, this characteristic has been ignored, thus emphasising "Ikken Hissatsu". Arduous training is required to effectively attain such a technique.
Still new evidence using clinical data and articles have shown that some of the stories where Ikken Hissatsu was applied may have some truth. These sites are seen in injuries such as clipping the knees in football, in little league baseball when children are hit in the chest without protection causing Cordis commotio

Electronics technician (United States Navy)

The United States Navy occupational rating of electronics technician (abbreviated as ET) is a designation given by the Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) to enlisted members who satisfactorily complete initial Electronics Technician "A" school training.
History of the rating.
The electronics technician rating was originally established as radio technician in 1942 during the height of World War II. The rating badge adopted was that of the established radioman rating, and remained until 1945, when the rating name was changed to electronic technician's mate. In 1948, the Navy changed the name of the rating to electronics technician, and a new rating badge was created, both of which are still in use today.
"A" School and "C" School Training.
Surface ETs must complete Apprentice Technical Training (ATT), followed by Electronics Technician "A" School. Non-Nuclear ET's attend ATT and "A" School at Naval Training Center Great Lakes, Illinois. Submarine ETs (navigation and communications) must complete Basic Enlisted Submarine School, ATT, Tactical Computer and Network Operator, and "A" School at Naval Submarine School in Groton, CT. Nuclear ET's attend "A" School at Naval Weapons Station Charleston in Goose Creek, South Carolina for Nuclear Field "A" School. While the Surface ET's "A" school was originally very hands-on, it is now entirely conducted through self-study computer based training with 7 hands-on labs used to demonstrate the student's aptitude with the equipment they will be working with once out in fleet. Nuclear ET's "A" school is extremely hands on with a curriculum that includes basic math, basic electrical theory, electrical fundamentals, digital microprocessor design, and instrumentation and control equipment. Nuclear ET's endure eight hours of lecture and labs five days a week for six months with extra study hours ranging from voluntary to thirty additional hours per week. Once "A" school is complete, most ETs move onto a "C" school to learn more in-depth knowledge of electronics for one specific system used aboard ship. This earns them a DNEC, which is further used to determine where they will be stationed after schooling is finished. ETs may be in training for 2 years or more and the rating often requires the sailor to extend their enlistment to 6 years.
Non-Nuclear ETs are responsible for the electronic equipment used to send and receive messages, detect enemy planes and ships, and determine target distance. They maintain, repair, calibrate, tune, and adjust all electronic equipment used for communications, detection and tracking, recognition and identification, navigation, and electronic countermeasures.
Nuclear ETs are responsible for the electronic equipment used to monitor and control the nuclear reactors onboard US Navy vessels. They maintain, repair, calibrate, tune, adjust, and operate all nuclear electronic equipment responsible for safe operation of the nuclear reactor(s).
ET subcategory specialty areas.
Surface.
Surface ETs maintain and repair electronics equipment such as radar, communication and navigation equipment. ETs can also perform the function of an IT by operating and maintaining computer networks depending upon what billet (job) they serve in. The ET and FC (Advanced Electronics Computer Fields) ratings comprise the basis of the ship's combat systems department aboard ships and are responsible for maintaining the ship's readiness for combat operations.
Entry rates PO3-PO2 (E4-E5) specialize as electronics communications technician, electronics data systems technician, or electronics radar systems technician. PO1-CPO (E6-E7) are electronics systems managers.
Submarines: radio and navigation.
Submarine ETs are divided into two distinct job functions, radio ET(R) and navigation ET(V). Radio ETs are responsible for maintaining, operating, and administrating the submarine's radio communication and ESM equipment, systems and programs, including the submarine's masts and antennas. Navigation ETs are responsible for maintaining, operating, and administrating the submarine's navigation, military/commercial radar, interior communications, non-nuclear remote indication and control circuitry equipment systems and programs in addition to being responsible for all honors and naval ceremonies conducted on the ship.
Nuclear.
Nuclear-trained ETs perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants primarily in operating, maintaining, and repairing reactor instrumentation and control systems. Nuclear ETs may be assigned as an operator to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, as an instructor at a Navy nuclear power training command, or as a technician at a shipyard or other nuclear support facility. Additionally nuclear ETs may volunteer for nuclear submarine service. Nuclear ETs are the only rating in the Navy that can qualify as a reactor operator of a naval nuclear propulsion plant.
Training.
Nuclear ETs complete several different phases of training in order to be able to operate a naval nuclear propulsion plant. In order to be selected for nuclear training prospective Navy recruits must have a high enough cutscore on the Armed Service Vocational Battery (ASVAB) that score being greater than 88 and the Navy Advanced Placement Test (NAPT) that score being greater than 55%. Prospective nuclear recruits are then sent to Navy boot camp where prospective nuclear trainees are selected in a 50-30-20 ratio to be trained as nuclear machinist's mates, nuclear electrician's mate, or nuclear electronics technicians. Those who are selected to be nuclear electronics technicians then enter the Navy Nuclear Pipeline to train to become a nuclear ET.
In the first stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, prospective nuclear ETs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Field 'A' School (NFAS) at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command (NNPTC) in Goose Creek, SC. The curriculum at NFAS includes a mathematics refresher course, basic electronics theory, analog electronics theory (EFUNDS), digital electronics theory, and instrumentation and control equipment (I&CE) theory and maintenance. The curriculum is presented in a high paced manner that ramps up over the term at NFAS in order to prepare students for the difficulties of Nuclear Power School. The curriculum is very similar to that which is presented to nuclear electricians except that nuclear electricians train in electrical motor and generator theory and maintenance instead of I&CE theory and maintenance. Due to the specialized training given at NFAS, nuclear ETs who have trained there instead of another ET 'A' school are not qualified to be assigned to billets designed for non-nuclear ETs. Nuclear ETs are more highly trained in the fundamentals of electrical theory and thus the money spent on their training would be wasted were they to not pursue a nuclear career. Personnel who are disqualified from Navy nuclear work ('de-nuked') or who fail to qualify for Navy nuclear work later in the pipeline are reclassified into another rating in order to remain in the Navy.
In the second stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Power School at the NNPTC. The curriculum for ETs at the Nuclear Power School includes a higher level mathematics (Calculus) refresher course, introduction to nuclear propulsion systems, Navy nuclear mechanical, electrical, and electronics system design, reactor theory, health physics, basic materials science, and chemistry as it applies to nuclear power plants. The curriculum is similar for MMs, EMs, and ETs, except that each rating focuses more on their particular nuclear system design (for nuclear ETs this means that they have additional training in nuclear electronics design).
In the third and final stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETs are trained for six months at one of four Navy nuclear prototype training units (NPTUs). Two NPTUs are moored training ships (MTS) using S5W reactors located at the Naval Weapons Station in Charleston, SC., and two additional NPTUs are land-based prototype units using a S7G reactor and a S8G reactor located in Saratoga Springs, NY. The curriculum for ETs at an NPTU includes detailed health physics training, design, operation, and maintenance of electronics systems for the NPTU, nuclear watchstanding procedures, and nuclear casualty procedures. Unlike the first two stages of the Navy Nuclear Pipeline where the curriculum is presented in a typical classroom format, training at an NPTU is self-motivated training where students are required to research different aspects of a nuclear propulsion plant design, operation, or theory and demonstrate this knowledge in an oral interview with a qualified nuclear instructor. Additionally, nuclear ETs must perform graded watches under the instruction of a qualified nuclear instructor where they operate a particular piece of nuclear equipment or respond to a casualty. The culmination of training for a nuclear ET is an oral board where a nuclear ET must demonstrate the knowledge of all procedures, equipment, theory expected for a nuclear reactor operator. Completion of NPTU qualifies a nuclear ET to stand watch on the NPTU or to train to operate nuclear propulsion plants on a nuclear aircraft carrier or submarine. Additionally, it gives the individual the nuclear ET Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC), and the individual is then said to be "nuclear qualified."
Upon completion of the Naval Nuclear Pipeline, most nuclear qualified ETs are sent to nuclear aircraft carriers or nuclear submarines. On a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, nuclear ETs are sent to a nuclear training division where they train to qualify to operate the nuclear reactors of the ship in a similar way to NPTU for about six months prior to being sent to a reactor control division. In contrast, on a submarine nuclear ETs are directly assigned to the Reactor Controls division and are directed to qualify different watches incrementally. Due to the smaller number of personnel on a nuclear submarine, nuclear ETs must also cross qualify on several nuclear electrician watches. Since nuclear ETs are required to stand watches, perform maintenance, and train and qualify on additional submarine systems, it is not uncommon for it to take over 12 months for a nuclear ET to become fully qualified as a reactor operator, shutdown reactor operator, and all intermediate watches. Upon subsequent transfer to an NPTU or another nuclear ship, operators are required to re-qualify the same watches in only about 6 months.
Even upon completion of being fully qualified on all nuclear ET watches ("qualified in rate"), additional proficiency and casualty training is required for all nuclear ETs. On a ship this generally includes general Engineering or Reactor Department training, Reactor Controls division training, periodic exams and interviews, monitored maintenance and operations, periodic watch re-qualifications, and monitored tactical or casualty drills.
Usually after a nuclear ET is "fully qualified" the individual is sent to an "in-rate" technical school ETMS where the technician studies electronic troubleshooting and repair on shipboard equipment. Completion of this school allows the technician to be designated with the NEC 3373.
Senior nuclear ETs (typically those who hold the rank of petty officer first class or higher) are expected to qualify for senior supervisory watches. Self-motivated training for this includes the detailed operations of all nuclear systems on a ship (not just the nuclear ET specific parts) focusing on the big picture view of nuclear operations and casualty response. The training time required to qualify for senior supervisory watches depends on the individual.

Geneviève Halévy

Geneviève Halévy, later Geneviève Bizet and Geneviève Straus (Paris, 26 February 1849 – 1926), was a French salonnière. She inspired Marcel Proust as a model for the Duchesse de Guermantes and Odette de Crécy in "À la recherche du temps perdu".
Geneviève Halévy was the daughter of the composer Jacques-Fromental Halévy, and his spouse, née Léonie Rodrigues-Henriques, both Jewish. Geneviève Halévy's youth was sad: she lost her father when she was 13 years old, her elder sister when she was 15 years old, and her mother suffered from periods of mental instability. In 1869, she married Georges Bizet, pupil of her father, and gave birth in 1871 to their son Jacques, who became a school friend of Marcel Proust. Bizet died suddenly of a heart attack, in 1875. Geneviève moved to live with her uncle, Léon Halévy, and opened a "salon" for her cousin Ludovic Halévy, where she helped him in receiving the cream of the artistic society of the time. This was known as "Ludovic's Thursdays" (Les jeudis de Ludovic).
After a few years, she opened her own "salon" where distinguished society, such as Baron and Baronness Alphonse de Rothschild, Comtesse Potocka, Duchesse de Richelieu, Comtesse de Chevigné, née de Sade (another model for the Duchesse de Guermantes), etc. could meet with writers and intellectuals such as Guy de Maupassant, Henri Meilhac, Georges de Porto-Riche, Paul Bourget, Paul Hervieu, Joseph Reinach, and of course her cousin Ludovic. 
In 1886, she married the lawyer Émile Straus, an acquaintance of the Rothschild family, and her "salon" became increasingly fashionable: She received Robert de Montesquiou and his cousin Comtesse Greffulhe, painters and journalists. Many supporters of Dreyfus socialized at Mme Straus's "salon", amongst them Marcel Proust who was one of the first intellectuals to sign a petition in "L'Aurore" at the time of the Dreyfus Affair. After the Affair the salon became less prominent. 
After 1910, Mme. Straus became increasingly depressed, and cut herself off from society. Her son committed suicide in 1922, a few weeks before Proust's own death, and she died in 1926.

Most employers prefer to hire electronics technicians with an associate degree or other post-secondary training in engineering technology. Training is available at technical institutes, at community colleges, at extension divisions of colleges and universities, at public and private vocational-technical schools, and in the Armed Forces. Naval electronics technicians are the largest group of engineering technicians in the military (see Electronics Technician (US Navy)). Many 2-year associate degree programs accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) include at least college algebra and trigonometry and one or two basic science courses. Depending on the specialty, more math or science may be required. About 200 ABET-accredited programs are offered in engineering technology specialities. ABET-accredited electronics technician programs usually require at least two mathematics courses and two physics courses in addition to the core competencies.
Electronics technician curriculum generally consists of courses in basic electricity and electronics, including Ohm's Law, Parallel and Series Circuits, Magnetism, AC/DC Circuits, Capacitance, Inductance, Transformers, Resonance, Filters, Semiconductors, Transistors, Amplifiers, Integrated Circuits and Digital electronics. In addition to vocational learning outcomes associated with the study of electronics and control systems, graduates of electronics technician programs are also expected to have essential employability skills and meet certain general education learning outcomes. Individual schools largely determine the specific program structure, delivery methods, and other curriculum components to be used to assist students in achieving the required program outcomes.
A significant component of course material includes laboratory experimentation. These lab courses and projects often represent up to 50% of the course material and are used to reinforce theoretical concepts associated with the study of electronics. Schools offering electronics technician programs will have electronics laboratories to support the delivery of course curriculum. Historically, these laboratories have been traditional "hands on" learning environments, although in recent years the trend is moving towards electronics simulation software such as Multisim and CircuitLogix. Electronics software simulation is also used in conjunction with traditional labs to provide greater opportunities for students to complete laboratory projects as part of their studies.
Career prospects.
The demand for jobs in the electronics engineering and service fields is the result of a recent proliferation of both consumer and industrial electronics products. The design, installation, servicing and maintenance of this equipment has created significant employment opportunities in the electronics industry.
Typical job-related activities may involve:
Job opportunities for electrical and electronics technologists and technicians are increasing because many industries use electronic products and systems. Key sectors are telecommunications, audio/video, computers, robotics, energy conversion and efficiency, power generation, transmission and distribution, and electrical equipment manufacturing.
Employment opportunities for electronics technicians vary and are largely based on their areas of expertise. For example, employment growth for Electronics technicians in areas such as robotics, energy conversion, and power generation is expected to grow by 5%/yr from 2010 through 2020.

James Ferguson (major-general)

James Ferguson (died 1705), of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill, Kincardineshire, was a Scottish major-general, colonel of the Cameronian regiment.
Ferguson was the third son of William Ferguson, laird of Badifurrow, who represented Inverurie in the first Scottish parliament after the Restoration, remembered for its demonstrative loyalty as the ‘drunken parliament.’ James was a younger brother of Robert Ferguson ‘the Plotter’.
Military career.
He appears to have entered the Scots brigade in the pay of Holland, probably as a gentleman volunteer, some time during the reign of Charles II. His first commission, that of quartermaster in Colonel Macdonald's battalion of the brigade, was dated 12 June 1677. He became ensign in the battalion in September 1678, and lieutenant in February 1682. His battalion was one of those brought over to England in 1685 at the time of Monmouth's rebellion. He became captain in 1687, and in 1688 landed with William of Orange at Torbay. His regiment, then known as Balfour's, afterwards as Lauder's, was one of those first landed, and soon after despatched from London to Leith under Mackay. The fight at Killiecrankie, where he is said to have been taken prisoner, left him a regimental major; and in March 1690 he was despatched by General Mackay, who described him as ‘a resolute, well-affected officer,’ in whose discretion and diligence he had full reliance, at the head of six hundred men, to reduce the western isles, a service he accomplished satisfactorily with the aid of the Glasgow authorities and the co-operation of Captain Pottinger of the Dartmouth frigate (Ferguson, pp. 15–16).
In 1692 he was back in the Low Countries, and was present with his regiment (Lauder's) at the battle of Steenkirk. A few days after, on 1 August 1692, he was appointed lieutenant-colonel of Monro's (late Angus's, now the 1st Cameronians, Scottish rifles), which at the time was in Dutch pay. Ferguson led the regiment at the battle of Landen and at the siege of Namur. On 25 August 1693 he had been appointed to the colonelcy, which he held up to his death. Owing to the reductions after the peace of Ryswick the regiment was retained in the Netherlands, with the rank of brigadier-general. In the campaign of 1704 he commanded a brigade which led the attack on the heights of Schellenberg, and at Blenheim shared with Row's brigade the protracted fighting round the strongest part of the enemy's position.
About Christmas the same year Ferguson married his second wife.
In the campaign of the year following he had a brigade at the forcing of the enemy's lines in Brabant, and afterwards commanded, with the rank of major-general, at 's-Hertogenbosch, where he died very suddenly—the family tradition says by poison—on 22 Oct. 1705. An old manuscript states that ‘he served in four reigns, still maintaining the character of a brave, valiant, and prudent officer, until, his fame raising envy in the breast of the then commanding officer, he was cut off by very sinister means’ (ib. p. 46). Contemporary writers are discreetly silent on this ugly story, but all agree in regretting his loss as a brave and experienced officer. He was buried in St. Jan's Kerk, 's-Hertogenbosch, where there is a small tablet to his memory. There is also a memorial in Old Deer Churchyard.
Personal life.
Ferguson's first wife was Helen, daughter of James Drummond of Cultmalindie, Perthshire, by whom he had a son and daughter; his second, Hester Elizabeth, daughter of Abraham Hibelet, pastor of the Walloon Church, survived him and remarried Captain Hendrik Chombach. By her Ferguson had a daughter, who in 1730 married M. Gerard Vink, advocate, 's-Hertogenbosch. Ferguson's son James succeeded him, and died in 1777. He was only ten years old when his father died. The General's will had been drawn up by his nephew James Ferguson and as executor he sold the estates of Balmakelly and Kirtonhill and bought those of Kinmundy and Coynach, (now part of the settlement of Clola), Aberdeenshire (Burke, Landed Gentry, 1886, vol. i.), now held by his descendants. The Kinmundy estate was listed as extending to 4,068 acres with an annual income valued at £3,900 in 1883.
Biography.
A representative of the family, Mr. Ferguson, F.R.S., of Kinmundy, published a short biography of Major-general James Ferguson, from family sources (with portrait), which forms part of ‘Two Scottish Soldiers’ (Aberdeen, 1888).

The SIDBI Foundation for Microcredit

The SIDBI foundation for Microcredit (SFMC)
Background.
The SIDBI Foundation for microcredit (SFMC) is a department of Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and a non-governmental organization that provides bulk loans to Microfinance institutions (MFIs) in India. In practice, it acts as an oversight over MFIs which are the intermediaries between the retail borrowers consisting of poor people and individual borrowers living in rural areas or urban slums and the public sector development finance institutions.
The SFMC plays an increasingly important role in providing ‘user-friendly’ formal financial services to the poor due to the failure of the main poverty alleviation programme - the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). Extensive malpractices, misutilisation of funds and low repayment rates (25-33 percent) have urged a shift towards semi-formal development finance institutions. This pattern of an increasing involvement of financial institutions with micro-finance in developing countries follows on the success stories within the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe and Cooperative Bank of Kenya.
Methodology.
Currently, the SFMC provides funds for on-lending and capacity building support to 44 MFIs with over 1.3 million members. The majority of MFIs operated under a self-help group model (SHG). 90 percent of its total members are concentrated in the southern states, with 78 percent of them operating within a rural environment and a 95 percent membership rate among women. Rural farmers were targeted because of their perceived needs for micro-credit, used either to invest in productive activities or correct income shortfalls resulting from adverse harvest outcomes. At the same time, women were placed at the forefront because they tend to be more willing to attend group meetings and adhere to loan and savings conditions. Moreover, they were almost more likely to reinvest in the household needs of their families.
Outcomes.
An impact survey was commissioned by the SFMC from 2002 to 2006 to study the impacts of its programs. The average loan over this period was Rs. 9,100 ($165), and 72 per cent of this amount was used for investment (animals and non-farm enterprises), while the remaining 28 per cent was used to meet household needs (healthcare, food and marriage dowries).
Dependency burden
More importantly, since micro-credit represents only one source of loans, some reduction on the dependence on informal sources like moneylenders and family friends was noted. Specifically, the dependency ratio on moneylenders fell from 44 percent to 34 percent, while borrowing from other informal sources fell from 40 percent to 25 percent. This represents a significant improvement on the borrowing terms as informal sources were reported to charge interest rates of above 36 percent, sometimes even up to 200 percent for short-term loans. This compares unfavorably to the 14 percent and 41 percent charged respectively by MFIs.
Incomes
In addition, 70 percent of the supported enterprises reported an increase in income as a result of micro-credit - by ‘taking advantage of working capital to diversify or improve the quality of goods’, or through savings by making seasonal bulk purchases. In the urban sample, part of this diversification was directed at manufacturing (10 percent) and new non-farm enterprises like a small shop or handlooms (25 percent). On the other hand, clients in the rural sample invested proportionally between agriculture, animals and non-farm activities like a milch animal. This has helped to reduce the dependency of farmers to seasonal incomes and encourages ‘grass roots level’ entrepreneurship. At the same time, investment into insurance has also helped farmers to hedge against the risk of seasonal difficulties, like an extended monsoon season.
Women and Education
Around 17 percent of the clients with school-age children made borrowings to meet schooling costs, thus opening up new opportunities for social mobility. At the same time within the SHGs, women gain a sense of self-respect and confidence from a collective sharing of experiences and common action. Also, they becoming increasingly involved in joint enterprise management with men, reported in 71 percent of the supported enterprises in the south and 39 percent in the north. This joint-income household pattern helps to alleviate the income burden on men and contributes towards the drive from poverty.

Wolf's Castle Halt railway station

Wolf's Castle Halt railway station was on the Clarbeston Road and Letterston line of the Great Western Railway. It served the villages of Wolf's Castle and Ford between 1913 and 1964.
History.
The Clarbeston Road and Letterston Railway, s subsidiary of the Great Western Railway (GWR), was opened on 30 August 1906, but at first there were no intermediate stations. However, there was a signal box at Wolf's Castle, because although most of the route was built as double track, a portion near the middle, which included Spittal Tunnel and the cutting through Treffgarne Gorge, was single-track, and it was necessary to have signal boxes at each end of the single-track section. The single-track section was later doubled, but although the temporary signal boxes at Spittal and Treffgarne closed with the introduction of full double-track working on 17 December 1906, Wolf's Castle signal box was retained to break the section, allowing two trains to proceed in the same direction between Clarbeston Road and Letterston simultaneously; there was also a crossover.
The first of three intermediate stations to open on the line was "Wolf's Castle Halt" on 1 October 1913. It was situated from Paddington (via the Severn Tunnel), and was on a level stretch of line to the east of the signal box. The stations to either side in 1923 were and . Unusually for a GWR halt, the two platforms were built of brick rather than wood, as were the shelters. The up platform was long, and the down platform was long. The station nameboards stated "Wolf's Castle Halt for Treffgarne Rocks". The service was operated using GWR steam rail motors running between and ; there were three trains a day in each direction.
The crossover was removed in 1924, and the signal box was taken out of use on 17 February 1925; it was transferred to .
The station closed on 6 April 1964, as did all the other stations between Clarbeston Road and Fishguard Harbour.
In 2011, the waiting shelters on the platforms no longer exist and the line has been reduced to a single track positioned about halfway between the platforms, which would prevent any future use. The track is also raised on an embankment of ballast, so even if it was still alongside the platform the train doors would be some distance above the platform height.

James Frederic Ferguson

James Frederic Ferguson (1807–1855) was an Irish antiquary.
Life.
Ferguson was born at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1807. He was of French descent, son of Jacques Frédéric Jaquemain, a native of Cambrai. During the time of the French Revolution Jaquemain left France and settled in London, assuming the name of Ferguson in 1793. Six years later he went to America, and in 1800 became deputy-postmaster of Beaufort, South Carolina, where he resided till 1812. After the death of his wife, an English lady, Jaquemain went to London, where he became a teacher of languages. Subsequently he established a school in St. Stephen's Green, Dublin. In 1823 he published a volume of Italian translations from the classic poets.
James Frederic Ferguson the younger accompanied his father to Dublin in 1820, and some years later was engaged on behalf of Lord Kingsland in endeavouring to recover for that nobleman the Kingsland estates. His efforts were partially successful. In 1850 Ferguson was appointed clerk and secretary to a commission for arranging the records of the Irish courts, and this office he held until its abolition two years later. By direction of the chief baron, he continued in charge of the records from the time of the cessation of the commission until his death. On one occasion he undertook at his own expense a journey to Switzerland, in order to recover some Irish records in the collection of a Swabian baron. These records proved to belong to the Irish court of king's bench in the reign of Edward I, and it was surmised that they had been purloined in the reign of George I when Addison was keeper of the records in the Bermingham Tower. Ferguson purchased them at his own cost, and restored them to the Irish Record Office. 
Ferguson died on 26 November 1855.
Works.
He became a collaborator with William Lynch, author of ‘Feudal Dignities in Ireland,’ in arranging the voluminous series of ‘Irish Records.’ Extensive collections of documents were formed, some of which afterwards passed into the library of Sir William Betham. Ferguson's most important work was the indexing of the entire body of ‘Exchequer Records’ in Ireland, which he completed unassisted. The indexes were purchased by the government in order to be permanently deposited in the court of exchequer.
In 1843 Ferguson published ‘Remarks on the Limitations of Actions Bill intended for Ireland; together with short extracts from Ancient Records relating to Advowsons of Churches in Ireland.’ To the ‘Transactions of the Kilkenny Archæological Society’ he communicated a calendar of the contents of the ‘Red Book’ of the Irish exchequer; and to the ‘Gentleman's Magazine’ (January 1855) he communicated a description of the ancient drawing of the court of exchequer, contained in the above manuscript calendar. To the ‘Topographer and Genealogist’ he communicated the account of Sir Toby Caulfeild relative to the Earl of Tyrone and other fugitives from Ulster in 1616; a curious series of notes on the exactions anciently incident to tenures in Ireland; a list of the castles, &c., in Ireland in 1676, with a note on hearth- money; and a singular document of 3 Edward II, relative to a contest between the king's purveyors and the secular clergy of Meath. 
Ferguson further contributed to the ‘Gentleman's Magazine’ two important articles on the neglected state of the Irish State Records (1853–4), and a paper on the unpublished statutes of Ireland (1855). At his decease he left incomplete a translation of the ‘Norman-French Chronicle of the Conquest of Ireland,’ which M. Michel edited from a manuscript in the library of Lambeth Palace.

Grace (Skins)

Grace is the seventh and penultimate episode of series 5 of the UK TV series Skins, which first aired on the 3 March 2011 on E4. It focuses on Grace's (Jessica Sula) effort to get a good mark in her AS Drama by directing a production of William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" in order to be allowed by her father, David Blood, to stay at Roundview College.
Synopsis.
Rich and Grace wake up after having sex, and Grace realises, to her horror, that they are at her house, which she has always tried to avoid. It turns out that her father is David Blood, the Roundview College headmaster. She attempts to smuggle Rich out without her father noticing, and nearly succeeds. However, he is discovered in the garden after being attacked by their dog. Grace is forced to acknowledge him as her boyfriend.
After driving her to school, Blood firmly informs his daughter that their "experiment" is over and it is time she returned to her old boarding school. After Grace protests, he agrees that she may stay on the condition that she get's A's, starting now from her AS drama exam, a production of "Twelfth Night", which stars the entire gang. Her relief turns to fear when Liv, a lead, forces Matty to quit as well, saying it is because she feels the gang are still angry with her for what she did with Nick. In fact, she is actually doing it because she has grown suspicious that Franky loves Matty, after watching them rehearse a particularly emotional scene from the play. Grace, after hearing Liv's excuse, decides to invite her, along with the other girls, to her house for a girl's night. Meanwhile, Rich is called into Professor Blood's office, where Blood has his academic records and his father's employment records. Fearing that this position will be compromised now that Rich knows of Grace's true identity, he offers to help Rich and give his father a better position in the Civil Service, if he sabotages Grace's play, leaving Rich in a difficult choice to either help his not so well of family or Grace.
Shortly after, he agrees to invite Rich to dinner - which is very awkward, mostly due to his continual glaring at him. After dinner, Rich has a quiet argument with Grace, noting that she is a different person around her parents than when around him. Then the three girls arrive for the promised girls' night. They are shocked to discover Grace's secret, but then go up to Grace's room. There, she attempts to get them to rehearse, but they give in to Liv's offer of cocaine. While high, Franky's sexuality is brought up again, this time by Mini. When Franky gives the very vague response of saying she is "into people," Liv suspiciously asks her who she is "into" at the moment. Seeing Franky is unwilling to answer this question, Grace changes the subject.
After Professor Blood becomes suspicious, they quickly leave and go to a nearby nightclub. There, Mini and Franky go off to flirt with two unattractive men as a joke, and Grace discovers the rest of the gang are there. Tensions arise when Matty, seeing that one of the men is being too forward with Franky, marches over and scares him off, only to get into an argument with Mini and Liv. Grace then attempts to leave with a drunk Rich. Rich, however, firmly informs her that he doesn't know who is the real Grace, and angrily walks home himself. The next morning, Grace complains to her mother about the difficulty of her task and keeping her friends together. Her mother reminds her of the tale of Rapunzel, which she used to tell her when she was small. Deciding to “take control and be creative,” Grace instructs Mini, who is standing in for Liv, to kiss Franky, the next morning at rehearsal. Her argument with Rich continues when questions whether they are right for each other. Crying, she goes to the theatre (formerly the sports hall). There, she tests the acoustics by reciting "Hamlet's" "To Be or Not To Be" soliloquy with Doug. The words resonate with her and, feeling empowered, she goes to Matty's and demands that he return to the play. He does, but there is a noticeable tension between him and Franky, made clear when she avoids his kiss. Seeing that not having Liv around will affect her grade, Grace gets frustrated, and goes to look for her. After finding her, she talks her into returning to the play.
Grace’s production begins well, with Liv and Franky performing their scene well with limited practice together. Rich evidently does not sabotage the play, even shooting Professor Blood a defiant look as he performs his scene. However, having seen Matty’s shocked reaction at seeing her kiss Franky, Liv has a heated, but very quiet argument with him backstage. She demands to know if he is in love with Franky. When he fails to respond, she tearfully informs him that they’ll be good together. But Grace intervenes and tells her to stay. Angry, Liv tells Matty to forget Franky, who is left in something of a state just minutes before she is meant to go on again. But they are successful in performing the final scene and receive a standing ovation. But, to Grace’s fury, she discovers that her father has been deceiving her the whole time – despite the fact that she got a good grade, he actually intends to send her back to her old school anyway. He protests that “I just want better for you,” to which she coldly responds “No, David, you just want a different daughter.” Her mother comes into her room later that evening, and once again attempts to make her feel better with more stories, but she coldly scoffs at her mother for filling her head with lies and fantasies that mask her reality, causing her mother to leave unhappily.
At that moment, Rich turns up outside her window and serenades her by reciting some verses from "Romeo and Juliet" He climbs up the drainpipe into her room and, beginning to cry, asks her to marry him. She replies with Miranda's speech from "The Tempest": O wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world! That has such people in it!

Michael Murphy Andregg

Michael Murphy Andregg (born in Nevada, USA, 1951) is known for his study of the causes of war, global problems related to war, intelligence ethics and his peace activism. He founded and directs a non-profit organization called Ground Zero Minnesota dedicated to "top-quality, non-partisan education for informed democracy and human survival." Andregg has published numerous articles, study guides, documentaries and papers on biology, genetics, technology and contemporary social problems related to armed conflict. He has produced over 50 educational videos on wide-ranging subjects and his national award-winning book, "On the Causes of War", was released in November 1997.
Education.
Andregg earned a Ph.D. in behavior genetics (1977) from the University of California, Davis after completing a triple-major B.S. in genetics, zoology and physical anthropology (1973), studying under the tutelage of Theodosius Dobzhansky a prominent geneticist, evolutionary biologist and National Medal of Science recipient. During his university career, Andregg conducted field research on the behavior patterns of Barbary Apes (Macaca sylvanus) in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and co-authored several articles with his mentor Dobzhansky, including "Distribution Among the Chromosomes of Drosophila pseudoobscura of the Genes Governing the Response to Light" and "Ecological Variables Affecting the Dispersal Behavior of Drosophila pseudoobscura and its Relatives." After completing two years of postdoctoral research at the University of Minnesota, he came to believe that war was a much greater public health hazard than rare diseases and began dedicating his life to the study of contemporary social problems, especially causes of war and sustainable development.
Career.
Andregg's study of global armed conflict and genocide resulted in his book, "On the Causes of War", which won the American National Peacewriting Award in 1999, was reprinted twice, republished in Canada and translated into Italian. Since 1981, Andregg has taught undergraduate and graduate courses on the causes of war, global problems related to war, sustainable development and similar themes at the University of Minnesota, Macalester and Gustavus Adolphus Colleges. He is currently a professor in the Justice and Peace program at the University of St. Thomas and an adjunct at the University of Minnesota.
In 1982, Andregg founded an educational, non-profit organization called Ground Zero Minnesota, which has produced over 50 public television programs and sponsored over 5,000 educational programs in schools, churches, and civic groups on issues of peace and justice, many on the implications of weapons of mass destruction. He serves on the boards of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations and the Hawkinson Foundation for Peace and Justice and is involved with many academic associations.
As a corollary to his research on war, Andregg began studying the craft of intelligence-gathering, analysis and espionage, focusing on intelligence reform. He has arranged and moderated over twenty panels for intelligence-related conferences around the world. He wrote a chapter on intelligence ethics for a textbook on intelligence studies, a "Handbook on Intelligence Ethics", and a similar chapter for "The Oxford Handbook of National Security Intelligence" in 2009. His edited reader on intelligence ethics includes essays from 14 professionals from six countries. In 2008, Andregg released a documentary, "Rethinking 9/11: Why Truth and Reconciliation are Better Strategies Than Global War,", produced by ETS Pictures, which examines certain unanswered questions of who was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks and calls for a full, impartial examination of the evidence.
Dr. Andregg is a frequent public speaker, lecturer, media commentator and mediator and has briefed police, fire and public health officials on the effects of weapons of mass destruction. In 2008, he acted as liaison between peace activists and the local police department during the Republican National Convention, held in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

<doc id="31153988" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31153988" title="Trambelus">
Trambelus

In Greek mythology, Trambelus was a son of Telamon (thus a half-brother of Ajax the Great and Teucer). His mother was the Trojan captive, Hesione or Theaneira: when she had already been made pregnant by Telamon, she escaped by jumping off his ship and swimming until she reached the land of Miletus. She then hid in the forest but was soon found by Arion, king of Miletus, who rescued her and raised her newborn son Trambelus as his own. 
According to Parthenius, Trambelus lived on Lesbos where he fell in love with a girl named Apriate, but she rejected all his advances. Desperate, he laid a snare for her and tried to take her by force, but she defended herself so vigorously that he got enraged and pushed her off a cliff into the sea; alternately, she leapt off the cliff herself, preferring to die rather than give up her chastity.
Not much later, the same source relates, Lesbos was attacked by Achilles and his troops. Trambelus was among the defenders of the island and was mortally wounded in the battle. Achilles, impressed by his valor, inquired of his name; Trambelus managed to answer before he died. On realizing that the fallen opponent was his cousin, Achilles mourned Trambelus and piled up a tomb for him on the seashore; this tomb was still there in historical times.
John Tzetzes relates the same story of Trambelus' death, but states that it took place in Miletus (not on Lesbos). This version is also hinted at by Athenaeus, who refers to Trambelus as "king of the Leleges", and informs that there was a spring in Miletus known as the "Achilles' Well", in which Achilles was believed to have cleansed himself for the murder of Trambelus; the water of the spring was said to be salty on the surface, but very sweet in the main stream.

EyesOn Design

EyesOn Design are a series of events including an annual car show and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology. It has become a national event focused on the emotion and character of automotive design.
History.
The Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of automotive design and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a nonprofit organization in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan, devoted to matters pertaining to the eye and vision.
The first shows were called "Eyes On The Classics". The first shows were held in the Grosse Pointe Academy parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic "Big Three" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to "EyesOn Design". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House.
To ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year. The 2002 show was held at the Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was "Performance Vehicles".
In 2003, the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to General Motors, the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers. The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public. Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM concept cars.
A Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.
Design focus.
The "Eyes on Design Show" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance.
According to the Ford Motor Company, the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design.
Bringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives. In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features concept cars by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.
The vehicles shown at the annual event are by invitation. Judging in numerous classes is "based not on the quality of the restoration or authenticity"; rather it is on the basis of their "the design character, emotional appeal and artistic excellence of the vehicle."
Lifetime Design Achievement.
The EyesOn Design celebrations include the prestigious "Lifetime Design Achievement" award. This recognition is given to an accomplished automotive designer selected by previous winners of this award.

Americans in China

Americans in China comprises expatriates and immigrants from the United States as well as their locally born descendants. The number of Americans living in China has reached a historic high of 110,000.
Overview.
Most Americans in China reside in Hong Kong (48,220 in 1999), with much smaller numbers in Beijing (10,000), Guangzhou (3,200), Shanghai (2,382), Shenyang (555) and Chengdu (800).
Hong Kong.
Since the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, Americans have arguably surpassed the British as the major non-Chinese influence. There are more Americans than Britons living in the territory, and 1,100 American companies employ 10% of the Hong Kong workforce; the current head of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, Eden Woon, is the first American to hold the position in the territory's history. In addition, ships of the United States Navy make from 60 to 80 port visits each year.
Mainland China.
According to the Sixth National Population Census conducted in 2010, there are 71,493 Americans residing in Mainland China, the second largest single group of foreign nationals. Americans have been coming to China for job opportunities since 1994. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, a growing number of Americans in their 20s and 30s headed to China for employment, lured by its faster-growing economy and lower jobless rate. Many of them do basic work such as teaching English, a service in demand from Chinese businesspeople and students and a growing number are arriving with skills and experience in computers, finance and other fields.

Davao Central High School

Davao Central High School (Simplified Chinese: 纳卯中华中学; Traditional Chinese: 納卯中華中學; pinyin:" Nà Mǎo Zhōng Huá Zhōng Xué"), formerly known as Davao Chinese High School, is the first Chinese school in Davao City, established in June 3, 1924. It is a private, nonsectarian school situated Sta. Ana cor. J.P. Laurel Ave., Davao City, Philippines.
History.
The Davao Central High School, formerly known as the Davao Chinese High School, was founded on June 3, 1924. It traced its humble beginning to two rented classrooms at San Pedro Street with only 30 students. Seeing the necessity of acquiring a permanent school site, Don Francisco Villa-Abrille Lim Juna (林全份), a charter board member, donated a 10,000 square-meter lot, which became the present school site. The first building was a one-storey wooden structure. Classes were held in the new site in January 1925 with the aim of preserving and propagating Chinese language and culture. The school offered a dual curriculum in English and Chinese. It was then the only school in the City of Davao offering Chinese language.
After twenty years of development, three classroom buildings and one dormitory were constructed, with a student population of more than 300. However, toward the end of the Japanese occupation during the World War II, all but one building were destroyed. After the war, four more classroom buildings and one dormitory was constructed.
In 1965, the city government expropriated 1,789 square meters of the school property for the Sta. Ana Avenue, which cuts through the school campus. In 1976, in compliance with Presidential Decree No.176 Filipinizing alien schools all over the country, the name Davao Chinese High School was change into Davao Central High School.
From 1983 to 1998, the Board of Trustees under the leadership of the dynamic chairman, Guilbert Go, completed the construction of the three-storey concrete buildings and one four-storey building. This paved the way to start the modernization of Davao Central High School.
Delfin Go succeeded Guilbert Go as the chairman of the Board of Trustees in 1998. During his term, a modern three-storey building was constructed and named Tan Yan Kee Memorial Preschool in honor of the father of Dr. Lucio Tan, chairman emeritus of the Board of Trustees. Another grand project, the Jolly Central Covered Court, was donated by an alumnus, Tony Tan Caktiong. After the term of Delfin Go, Chua Tun-Chuan and Jesus Uy succeeded one after the other, as the chairmen of the Board. During their terms, the school continued to march achieving quality education.
School emblem.
The school emblem, representing the five-leaf clover, is the national flower of China known as the "Mei Hua." The tiny pink flower blooms in the coldest winter. The colder the weather, the more the beautiful its bloom. This rare quality symbolizes nobility and the strength of the character, as well as courage and persistence. Hence, it was chosen as the school emblem for the same significance.
Community.
Davao Central High School is part of the Filipino-Chinese schools in Davao City. Schools that teach Chinese are Davao Christian High School, Stella Maris Academy Of Davao, Colegio De San Ignacio, Philippine Academy of Sakya.

Yukhym Medvedev

Yukhym Medvedev (, ) (1 April 1886–7 June 1938) was the first elected chairman of the Soviet parliament in Ukraine. Medvedev was a member of various Communist parties, but in early 1930s quit his political life and committed himself to a civilian life. In January 1938 he was arrested by the State Security police and later that year shot on the grounds of being an anti-Soviet terrorist. In 1957 Medvedev was rehabilitated posthumously.
Medvedev was born in Bakhmut city of Yekaterinoslav Governorate in a family of Ukrainian ethnicity. After finishing the Bakhmut Technological College he worked as an electrical technician at factories of Bakhmut and Yekaterinoslav. In 1904 Medvedev enrolled into the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP), but in 1917 he became a member of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party. The same year he initiated the organization of the Kharkiv Ukrianian left social-democrats which cooperated with the Bolsheviks. In December 1917 Medvedev became one of the organizers of the "1st All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets of Peasant's, Worker's, and Soldier's Deputies" in Kharkiv. The congress formed the Central Executive Committee of Ukraine, a chairman of which Medvedev was elected on December 24, 1917. The committee supported the Bolshevik's intentions on the liquidation of the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic. In January–February 1918 he headed the Soviet Ukrainian delegation to the Brest's negotiations. Medvedev was dismissed as the chairman of TsVK in March 1918 and with withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Ukraine moved to Moscow. There he was a member of the Bureau of Ukrainian left social-democrats in exile. After the Russian aggression on Ukraine in August 1919 Medvedev joined Borotbists, however already in July 1920 the party has self-liquidated at its 4th Party Congress and most of its members joined the ranks of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine.

Mehboob (singer)

Mehboob (; 1925–1981) was an Indian musician and playback singer. He was one of the most successful playback singers in Malayalam film industry during the 1950s and early 1960s, with a good number of hit songs in his kitty.
Biography.
Mehboob was born in Mattancherry, Kingdom of Cochin, into a family beset with stark poverty. He spent his childhood in the nearby Bengal battalion military camp polishing shoes while his mother did cleaning jobs. At the camp Mehboob picked up different languages and songs from soldiers drawn from various parts of the country, some Britishers too.
Mehboob grew up to become the singer of choice for the various pre-nuptial ceremonies conducted by rich families in Cochin. He made his name, friends and admirers from here. Mehboob had no real home, but he lived with his friends. Many of his early songs were written by Mepalli Balan and Nelson Fernandes, with that special Mattancherry flavour. These songs were never recorded. It was Pankaj Mullick, who recognized Mehboob's singing ability for the first time. He recommended Mehboob for several "Kacheris" and Mohammed Rafi concerts.
Mehboob became quite famous throughout Cochin in late 1940s itself. Cochin based actor Muthiah recommended Mehboob to music director Dakshinamoorthy, who was looking for a new voice for the film "Jeevitha Nouka". Mehboob recorded three songs including the popular "Akaale Aarum Kaividum" for this film, widely known to be the first superhit film in Malayalam. (This song was a ditto copy of "Suhani Raat Dhal Chuki" from "Dulari". It was later in 1985, re-recorded by K. J. Yesudas and this version is featured in the currently available prints of the film.) With the success of this song, Mehboob was shot to fame and became the most sought after singer of that time. In 1954, he recorded "Manennum Vilikkila", for the landmark film "Neelakkuyil", which became a tremendous success. He went on to record numerous hit songs for composers M. S. Baburaj, K. Raghavan, G. Devarajan, R. K. Shekhar and many more. Most of his songs were folk music based comic numbers and had lyrics by P. Bhaskaran.
Mehboob has also recorded numerous songs for stage plays, gramaphone records and other programmes, which is perhaps many times more than he recorded for films. He was also an inevitable performer in "Mehfils" and other concerts. Mehboob was never a careerist. He was known to be an alcoholic and finally died nearly an impoverished man.
Many of his songs were remixed and used in later Malayalam films like in the 1999 Mohanlal-starrer "Usthaad", a part of the song "Theerchaayilla Janam", written by Kannan Pareekutty and sung in 1956, was rendered by Mohanlal. The 2013 film "Annayum Rasoolum" used the songs "Kannu Randu Kannu", composed by M. S. Baburaj and written by P. A. Kasim for the 1973 film "Chuzhi" and "Kayalinakkare" written by Meppalli Balan. The 2013 film "" featured the song "Nayapaisayilla" from the film "Neelisaali" (1960).

Beck's parents had emigrated to Argentina from Cumbria. He was anxious enough to serve in British uniform that he fibbed his way into the Royal Flying Corps while still underage. As he was born on 3 November 1899, his graduation from pilot training in July 1917 saw him pitched into battle before his "legal" 18th birthday.
World War I.
On 21 June 1917 temporary Second Lieutenant A. Beck was appointed a Flying Officer in the Royal Flying Corps. His seniority of rank was then back-dated to 1 June 1916. He then flew 13 combat patrols with 60 Squadron before his parents apprised the RFC of his true age. Once it was known he was younger than 18 years old, he was withdrawn from both combat duty and France.
He returned to 60 Squadron in March 1918, and scored his first win in August; flying a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a, he destroyed a German Fokker D.VII fighter plane on the 8th. He followed this up by destroying a Hannover reconnaissance plane over Riencourt in the early morning of 14 August, and an Albatros over Guemappe in mid-morning. On 31 August, he shared in the destruction of an LVG two-seater recon plane over Inchy.
On 28 September 1918, he destroyed another LVG two-seater over Cambrai to become an ace. Then, in October 1918, he scored five more times: a Fokker D.VII out of control over Esnes on the 3rd; an LVG captured at Bohain-en-Vermandois on the 9th; a Halberstadt recon plane captured on the 22nd at Orvillers-Sorel; a share in an LVG destroyed over Le Quesnoy on the 26th; another Fokker D.VII out of control over Mormal on the 29th.
On 1 November, he helped shoot down a Fokker D.VII over Mormal Woods for his and his squadron's final victory.
Post World War I.
He won a Distinguished Flying Cross, gazetted 3 December 1918. The accompanying award citation read:
"A bold and skilful leader, who has himself shot down four enemy aeroplanes. His personal courage and able leadership have had a marked influence in maintaining the efficiency of the squadron."

UCD American Football

University College Dublin American Football is the American football club at University College Dublin. It competes in the South Division of the Irish American Football League (IAFL).
History.
The UCD American Football team was founded in Spring 2007 by three University students. After a period of rapid development UCD Team entered the Irish American Football League. In its first ever season UCD team competed exclusively in the flag league of the IAFL. A successful run through the flag league set the club up perfectly for its assault on the kitted development league in the IAFL, the DV8's. Under the rules of the IAFL, UCD were forced to spend a year in a development league which was then called a DV8's league. DV8's followed the rules of eight-man football which is usually played by small schools in the United States.
2009 Season.
DV8's league comprised Dublin Dragons, Trinity College, Erris Rams and Craigavon Cowboys. UCD American Football managed a 4-0 start which surprised its opponents and fellow teams in the 11-a-side league. Overall in 2008/09 season UCD managed a 6-2 record with only 2 losses coming from north side rivals Trinity College. Trinity managed to pull off two shut-out victories by adjusting their gameplan after a blowout opening victory by UCD.
2010 Season.
After a successful developmental league season, the UCD American Football club prepared to embark on its first ever season in the 11-a-side IAFL Senior League. In November 2009, UCD American Football competed in the IAFL College Championship which was held in Limerick, County Limerick. UCD American Football fielded a plucky team with little experience and with few returning players. This resulted in disappointing losses to both the DCU and Trinity College teams in two low-scoring contests. Failing to advance to the championship game, UCD would return home to prepare for the 2010 season with lessons learned, but a low level of morale and confidence.
UCDAF, failing to secure a home ground within the Belfield campus, booked the vast majority of their home games in ALSAA, near Dublin Airport. The first of these was a crushing defeat at the hands of the UL Vikings, the end of which saw a 56-0 scoreline. Subsequent blowout losses saw the UCD American Football Team finish the 2010 season with a 2-6 record. Internal turmoil in the UCD camp was illustrated in several forfeited away games due to a lack of numbers. However, a mid-season rallying cry from then Team Captain Patrick Buttner and Head Coach John Collins saw UCD up their game later in the season. A season sweep of in-county and in-Division rivals, the Dublin Dragons ensued along with a close contest against eventual semi-finalists, the Carrickfergus Knights. 
The 2010 season, despite disappointment, saw the proliferation of a strong rookie class headed by star Quarter-Back Colin O'Meara and Linebacker Nick Hall, who were awarded Team Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year honours, respectively. The resolve of veteran players was also tested ultimately leading to the success of Cornerback David Murphy, All-rounder Vitaly Levdonski and, Team MVP, Free-Safety Kevin McFadden.
2011 Season.
UCD opened the season with the very first 11-a-side Colours Game, a close 16-20 loss to their north side rivals Trinity College. Victory would again become elusive to the young team, with the second game of the season being an away game to Division rivals and former Shamrock Bowl Champions University of Limerick Vikings. The Vikings dominated in a 6-56 rout of UCD, causing the more experienced players to reminisce over the failure of the prior season's shutout. Further disappointment came in an 0-8 loss to the Belfast Trojans in the two teams first ever fixture. Despite a rock-solid defense and an ominous opening drive in which QB Colin O'Meara suffered a burst vein in his throwing hand, UCD failed to score and were forced to suffer a third defeat in a row.
Their luck would soon change with a dominant 74-8 win over the Dublin Dragons. UCD started the game in style with an 80 yard kick return touchdown by rookie WR Conor Redmond. Conor would go on to return another Kickoff, a Punt and add a rushing TD, taking his tally to 30 Points for the season after 4 games. Running Back Dave Murphy had a breakout game with 87 rushing yards and 30 points on the ground. 2nd year Quarterback Colin O'Meara added 3 Touchdowns and 118 yards through the air and showed his talent eluding multiple sack attempts. UCDs Defense continued with their fine form by forcing 5 interceptions and kept the Dragons offence off the field for the majority of the game. The team took their form into their game against Cork Admirals winning 12-8. The Admirals put up a good fight and went into the half with an 8-0 lead over UCD. In the third quarter UCD began to build momentum as linebacker Dylan Carrig roared down the Cork offence with multiple tackles. The touchdown for UCD came when QB Colin O Meara threw to WR Dave Bennett who tucked the ball in at the end zone. The 2 points were converted by Andrew Kenny and Luca D'Ettore got a safety for UCD with a great sack.

Lega trotskista d'Italia

The Lega trotskista d'Italia of Trotskyist League of Italy is an Italian Trotskyist group. It is the Italian section of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist), or "Spartacist" tendency within international Trotskyism.
The Italian Spartacists came from two different organizational splits. One was formed in 1975 from dissidents of the Revolutionary Marxist Fraction led by Roberto Massari who announced the creation of a Spartacist Nucleus at the July 1975 European encampment of the international Spartacist tendency.
The other group had its origins in the Gruppi Comunisti Rivoluzionari, the Italian party affiliated with the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. This group left in 1976 in protest over the LCRs endorsement of the Proletarian Democracy electoral coalition, which it regarded as a kind of popular front. This group first called itself the Bolshevik-Leninist Group for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. It adopted the name Trotkyist League of Italy in April 1978, bey which time it had absorbed the Spartacist Nucleus. It also attempted to unify with the ex-Lambertist Bolshevik-Leninist Group of Italy, but nothing came of this.
The LTI grew closer to the international Spartacist tendency, sending a fraternal delegate to its first international conference in London in August 1979 and officially became its Italian sympathizing section in August 1980. Some members were not happy with this however. After the first conference they founded with International Proletarian Opposition within the LTI and in April 1980 left to form the Grupo Operaio Rivoluzionario por la rinascita della Quarta Internazionale.
By the early 1980s the LTI was centered in Milan where they published their monthly periodical "Spartaco".

Frank J. Weber

Frank J. Weber (August 7, 1849 – 1943) was a seaman, carpenter and union organizer from Milwaukee who between 1907 and 1926 served five (non-continuous) terms as a Socialist member of the Wisconsin State Assembly.
Background.
Weber was born in the city of Milwaukee on August 7, 1849. In 1852 his family moved to Grafton in Ozaukee County, and he attended public school in Ulao. After completing apprenticeship, Weber became an able seaman and sailed on Great Lakes and Atlantic Ocean merchant ships (according to his 1906 official biography, "in which capacity he visited all the most important seaports of the world").
Labor movement.
He joined the Lake Seamen's Union in 1868, and was active in the Knights of Labor after 1869. In 1887 he helped organize the Milwaukee Federated Trades Council, becoming its secretary in 1902: an office he would hold until his retirement in January 1934. In 1888 Weber organized ship cargo handlers into what became the International Longshoremen's Association, and in the same year organized a Carpenters' Union in Milwaukee. In 1893 Weber was chosen the first president of the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor. As of 1894 he refused the title of President, preferring to be General Organizer; he was to hold that office until 1917. Weber fought to align the State Federation of Labor with the goals and principles of the Social Democratic Party (as it was long known in Wisconsin). 
As of 1906 he boasted that he had been a member of a labor organization for 40 years, and was also one of the General Organizers of the American Federation of Labor.
Political office and service.
In 1904 Weber was a Socialist candidate for Presidential elector from Milwaukee. 
In 1906 he was elected to the Assembly from the 16th Milwaukee County district (the 20th ward of the City of Milwaukee), succeeding fellow Socialist August W. Strehlow. Weber won with 1,580 votes to 1,080 for Republican Edward Groeling. In 1908 he was re-elected, with 1,799 votes against to 1,380 for Republican Louis Goulki and 825 for Democrat Charles Newser. Weber was assigned to the standing committee on Manufactures and Labor. 
In the Assembly Weber worked for the passage of laws establishing the Wisconsin Industrial Commission (with Charles H. Crownhart and John R. Commons he wrote the industrial commission law in 1911), workmen's compensation, the state system of technical education, and other statutes favorable to the interests of the working class. 
In 1926 (at which time he was State Chairman of the Socialist Party of Wisconsin), rather than run for re-election to the Assembly, he opted to challenge incumbent State Senator Bernhard Gettelman. He lost the election to Gettelman, with 8,074 votes to 10,589 for the incumbent.
After the Assembly.
As he had always done when not in the legislature himself, he continued to spend time during the session at Madison lobbying for labor. Weber died in Milwaukee in 1943, known as "the grand old man of Wisconsin labor."

1989–90 Colchester United F.C. season

The 1989–90 season was Colchester United's ninth consecutive season in the Football League Fourth Division. The season ended in relegation to the Football Conference.
Season Review.
Hopes of building on the Jock Wallace regime were tattered when Colchester failed to win any of the opening eight games of 1989/90. Only two wins were secured before the turn of the year. Assistant manager Alan Ball left for Stoke and it was a closely guarded secret that Wallace was very ill with the onset of Parkinson's disease. Wallace moved upstairs and once again Steve Foley was in temporary charge. Many wanted him appointed permanently but Foley preferred his youth team duties.
Chairman Jonathan Crisp's regime was now over; £1m in debt and his next new manager was former Ipswich Town and England defender Mick Mills, recently sacked from Stoke. The new appointment had immediate effect as U's won three out of four in February and, as with the season before, faced up to a crunch game at the home of their nearest rivals. Leading Wrexham twice United succumbed to a 3-2 defeat. There was still time to recover but six defeats in the last eight games ended United's 40 season Football League tenure.

In Greek mythology, Euphorion (, "the abundant") was the son of Achilles and Helen. He was born when his parents had already been dwelling in the Land of the Blessed, and was named "after the fertility of the land". He had a pair of wings.
For unknown reasons, Euphorion became the object of Zeus' wrath. Zeus caught him on the island of Milos and killed him with a thunderbolt. He further prohibited to bury Euphorion; the island nymphs did bury him nevertheless and were changed into frogs for having disobeyed Zeus.

USCGC Point Cypress (WPB-82326)

USCGC "Point Cypress" (WPB-82326) was an Point class cutter constructed at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1961 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name cutters under in length, it was designated as "WPB-82326" when commissioned and acquired the name "Point Cypress" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than .
Construction and design details.
"Point Cypress" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment. 
The design specifications for "Point Cypress" included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13 man crew were installed for Vietnam service.
History.
After delivery in 1961, "Point Cypress" was assigned a homeport of Boston, Massachusetts, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. 
At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, "Point Cypress" was loaded on board merchant ship SS "Pioneer Myth" and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refit for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M-2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over-under 50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.
"Point Cypress" was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Navy Base near Vung Tau, along with , , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of , their temporary support ship. They arrived at their new duty station on 23 February and began patrolling the coastal waters near the Rung Sat Special Zone. Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board.
On 10 May 1966 while on patrol, Division 11 cutter interdicted a 120 foot steel hull trawler that beached near the Ca Mau Peninsula under covering fire from Viet Cong hiding in the tree line. With the assistance of and , the Viet Cong were prevented from boarding the trawler to retrieve the arms and supplies it carried. Authorization was received to destroy the trawler and "Point Cypress" assisted "Point Grey"; both cutters using their mortars to set the trawler on fire. Later the whole area was shaken with a tremendous explosion as the trawler's ammunition supplies exploded. This incident marked the first time a "Market Time" unit had interdicted a suspicious trawler.
"Point Cypress" helped with the rescue Philippine tug "Alyee" which was threatened by high seas while pulling four barges from 
Saigon to Cam Ranh Bay on 16 December 1967.
On 5 December 1968, Fireman Heriberto S. "Ed" Hernandez, a crewman of "Point Cypress", was killed in action during small boat operations near the Ca Mau Peninsula. He was one of seven Coast Guardsmen killed in action during the Vietnam War.
After 14 July 1970, "Point Cypress" and were the last two cutters left in Squadron One, the other 24 having been previously transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Navy under the United States government's Vietnamization policy. On 19 July 1970 "Point Cypress" along with "Point Marone" were pulled off "Market Time" duties and sent to the Thanh Phu Secret Zone to land Kit Carson Scouts for a search and destroy mission. The two cutters used their mortars and machine guns to back up the assault which resulted in the capture of Viet Cong troops and boxes of enemy documents. A week later the same tactics were used with success by landing an Australian explosive ordnance detachment on the My Thanh River.
The last patrol of "Point Cypress" was conducted on 4 August with "Point Marone" in a narrow canal flowing into the Cổ Chiên River with 25 Kit Carson Scouts aboard each cutter and a mostly South Vietnamese Navy crew. After both cutters had turned around in the narrow canal, "Point Marone" was damaged by a command detonated mine causing three deaths among the Vietnamese crew and Scouts and several injuries. "Point Cypress" provided suppression fire with machine guns and her mortar and the "Point Marone" managed to clear the ambush scene. Eleven days later, on 15 August 1970 the patched and painted "Point Marone" and the "Point Cypress" were turned over to the Republic of Vietnam Navy with "Point Cypress" recommissioned as RVNS "Hồ Duy" (HQ-724).

Kansas Department of Agriculture, Division of Water Resources

The Division of Water Resources within the Kansas Department of Agriculture governs the use and allocation of the state's water resources; regulates the construction of dams, levees and other changes to streams; represents Kansas on its four interstate river compacts; and coordinates the National Flood Insurance Program in Kansas. These responsibilities are accomplished through the administration of 30 state laws, including the Kansas Water Appropriation Act, Groundwater Management District Act, Obstructions in Streams, and the Levee Law.
The Division of Water Resources is one of several state agencies managing the state's water resources. Its role is principally regulatory. Other agencies and their roles associated with water include the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (water quality regulation); Kansas Water Office (water planning and policy); and the State Conservation Commission (soil and water conservation projects).
The chief engineer leads the Division of Water Resources. David Barfield has served as chief engineer since 2007, being the fifth chief engineer since the Division’s inception. The Division of Water Resources is organized around three programs: Water Appropriation, Water Structures, and Water Management Services. The Division of Water Resources is headquartered in Topeka, Kansas, with field office locations in Topeka, Stafford, Stockton, and Garden City.
History.
1927-1951.
The Division of Water Resources was created in 1927, which effectively consolidated the Kansas Water Commission of 1917 and the Division of Irrigation of 1919. George S. Knapp, who had been appointed state irrigation commissioner, became the first chief engineer in 1927. Under his 32 years of service, various laws were enacted, including the Levee Law (1929), Obstructions in Streams (1929), Water Storage Law (1941), and the Kansas Water Appropriation Act (1945). Also signed at this time were the Republican River Compact (1943) and the Arkansas River Compact (1949).
1951-1972.
In 1951, Robert V. Smrha became the second chief engineer and served for 21 years. Under his administration there were major amendments to the Kansas Water Appropriation Act in 1957 that addressed water right changes and filing requirements. In addition, the Kansas-Oklahoma Arkansas River Compact (1966) and the Big Blue River Compact (1971) were signed. In 1972 the Groundwater Management District Act was enacted.
1972-1983.
Guy E. Gibson was the third chief engineer, who served from 1972 to 1983. Under Gibson, Groundwater Management District Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were formed in Kansas from 1973 to 1976. Major amendments to the Groundwater Management District Act occurred in 1978, which added a process to allow for the creation of intensive groundwater use control areas. This addition to the statutes provided the chief engineer authority to implement more comprehensive corrective control provisions for water supply protection when local conditions require it or by the request of local stakeholders. Intensive groundwater use control areas were designated in McPherson in 1980 and the Pawnee River Valley in 1981. In addition, the enactment of the Water Plan Storage Act (1974) and the Water Transfer Act (1983) occurred under Gibson’s administration.
1983-2007.
In 1983, David L. Pope became the fourth chief engineer and served for 24 years. Over his tenure, extensive rules and regulations were developed and adopted under the Kansas Water Appropriation Act, Obstructions in Steams, and the Levee Law. He also designated additional intensive groundwater use control areas in Burrton (1984), Lower Smoky Hill River Valley (1984), Hays (1985), Arkansas River Valley (1986), Upper Smoky Hill River Valley (1988), and Walnut Creek (1992). In addition, Kansas v. Colorado was filed in 1985 to enforce terms of the Arkansas River Compact. In 1998 Kansas v. Nebraska and Colorado also filed to enforce terms of the Republican River Compact. The Final Settlement Stipulation of the Republican River Compact occurred in 2003. For the Arkansas River Compact violations, damages exceeding $35 million were paid to Kansas in 2005-2006. Other milestones under Pope’s administration included the enactment of the Water Assurance Program Act (1986), Floodplain Zoning Ordinances Act (1991), and the Water Banking Act (2001).
2007-Current.
The present chief engineer, David Barfield has initiated the enforcement of the Republican River Compact Settlement in 2007 and concluded the Kansas v. Colorado litigation enforcing the Arkansas River Compact in 2009 in favor of Kansas. Barfield has worked to increase the development of groundwater modeling to analyze hydrologic conditions and for use as a tool to support decisions in water resource management. Barfield has ongoing dialogues with the Groundwater Management Districts and stakeholders regarding options to address areas with over appropriation of water resources, many of which are located in the Ogallala aquifer.

St James' Church, Enfield Highway

St James' Church, Enfield Highway, is an active Anglican church in Hertford Road, Enfield Highway, Greater London. It is a parish church in the deanery of Enfield, the archdeaconry of Hampstead, and the diocese of London.
History.
St James' was the first Anglican place of worship to be established in the parish of Enfield in addition to the parish church. It was built by subscription as a chapel of ease on land given by Woodham Connop. It was consecrated on 15 October 1831 by the Bishop of London, Charles Blomfield. A district was assigned to the church on 9 December 1833. It comprised the whole of the parish of east of a line drawn at a distance of 150 yards to the west of the main road from Edmonton to Cheshunt. The church was licensed for marriages in 1845.
The architect was William Conrad Lochner (c.1779-1861), surveyor to the Royal Exchange Assurance Co., who designed a church in a very similar style at de Beauvoir Town, Hackney, and restored St Andrew's church, Enfield. It was built from stock brick with stone dressings in a plain "Commissioners gothic" style with aisles and a western tower. Structural problems with the church soon emerged. In 1841 the "Ecclesiologist" magazine reported
"St James Enfield Highway which has been consecrated six or eight years, is already condemned as 'dangerous', since the heavy tied roof is threatening to fall in from the rotting of the ends of the beams, which are said to have been laid in the most disgraceful manner upon the mere damp brick-work"
The first incumumbent was T. W. Thirlwall. He was succeeded by Charles Warren, J. R. Nicholl and, in 1841, John Fuller Russell. Russell, who remained at the church until 1854 was a theological writer, committee member of the high church Cambridge Camden Society and a notable collector of early religious art. In 1854 he published "Obedience to the Church in Things Ritual: Two Sermons Preached in St. James's Church, Enfield Highway".
A large chancel was added at the expense of the Rev J. Harman in memory of his wife and consecrated in 1864.The east end of the church was seriously damaged by a fire in 1967, and the repairs included the removal of the chancel arch and extension of the sanctuary.
With its population of over 22,000, it is one of the largest parishes in England. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building.

Eugen Relgis

Eugen D. Relgis (backward reading of Eisig D. Sigler; first name also Eugenio, Eugène or Eugene, last name also Siegler or Siegler Watchel; March 22, 1895 – May 24, 1987) was a Romanian writer, pacifist philosopher and anarchist militant, known as a theorist of humanitarianism. His internationalist dogma, with distinct echoes from Judaism and Jewish ethics, was first shaped during World War I, when Relgis was a conscientious objector. Infused with anarcho-pacifism and socialism, it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as Romain Rolland, Stefan Zweig and Albert Einstein. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for eugenics, which centered on the compulsory sterilization of "degenerates". The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and sociological tracts.
After an early debut with Romania's Symbolist movement, Relgis promoted modernist literature and the poetry of Tudor Arghezi, signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of Expressionism and didactic art, giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a hearing impairment. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as "Sburătorul", "Contimporanul" or "Şantier", but also close to the more mainstream journal "Viaţa Românească". His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both fascism and communism: persecuted during World War II, he eventually took refuge in Uruguay. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of South American circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to world peace, as well as a promoter of Latin American culture.
Biology.
Early life and literary debut.
The future Eugen Relgis was a native of Moldavia region, belonging to the local Jewish community. His father, David Sigler, professed Judaism, and descended from tanners settled in Neamţ County. Eisig had two sisters, Adelina Derevici and Eugenia Soru, both of whom had careers in biochemistry. Born in either Iaşi city of Piatra Neamţ town, Eisig was educated in Piatra Neamţ, where he became friends with the family of novelist and Zionist leader A. L. Zissu. It was in Zissu's circle that Relgis probably first met his mentor, the Romanian modernist author Tudor Arghezi; at the time, Arghezi was married to Constanţa Zissu, mother of his photographer son Eli Lotar. The young writer later noted that he and Zissu were both touched by the wild landscape of the Ceahlău Massif and Piatra's "shtetl" atmosphere. In another one of his texts, Relgis recalled having been influenced in childhood by selective readings from the Romanian Jewish scholar Moses Schwarzfeld and his "Anuarul pentru Israeliţi" journal (he told that, during later years, he had collected the entire "Anuarul" collection).
Taking his first steps in literary life, Eisig Sigler adopted his new name through forms of wordplay which enjoyed some popularity among pseudonymous Jewish writers (the case of Paul Celan, born "Ancel"). He was from early on a promoter of Symbolist and modernist literature, a cause into which he blended his left-wing perspective and calls for Jewish emancipation. Writing in 2007, literary historian Paul Cernat suggested that Relgis, like fellow humanitarianist and Jewish intellectual Isac Ludo, had a "not at all negligible" part to play in the early diffusion of Romanian modernism. Relgis' main contribution in the 1910s was the Symbolist tribune "Fronda" ("The Fronde"), the three consecutive issues of which he edited, in Iaşi, between April and June 1912.
Like Ludo's review "Absolutio" (which saw print two years later), "Fronda" stood for the radical branch of the Romanian Symbolist movement in Iaşi, in contrast to both the left-leaning but traditionalist magazine "Viaţa Românească" and the more conventional Symbolism of "Versuri şi Proză" journal. Its editorial board, Relgis included, went anonymous, but their names were known to other periodicals of the day and to later researchers. According to Cernat, Relgis was "the most significant "Frondiste"", seconded by two future figures in Romanian Jewish journalism: Albert Schreiber and Carol Steinberg. Like Ludo and poet Benjamin Fondane, the "Fronda" group represented those Romanian Jewish aficionados in Iaşi who followed the Symbolist-modernist school of Arghezi, and who promoted Arghezi's poetry in northern Romania: "Fronda"s writers were noted for saluting "Viaţa Românească" when it too began hosting poems by Arghezi.
"Fronda" put out three issues in all, after which time Relgis became an occasional contributor to more circulated periodicals, among them "Rampa" (founded by Arghezi and the socialist agitator N. D. Cocea) and "Vieaţa Nouă" (led by Symbolist critic Ovid Densusianu). In 1913, he collected his loose philosophical essays, or "fantasies", in the volume "Triumful nefiinţei" ("The Triumph of Non-Being"). He published his first two books of poems during World War I, but before the end of Romania's neutrality period. The first one was a collection of sonnets, "Sonetele nebuniei" ("Sonnets of Madness"), printed at Iaşi in 1914; the second was published in the capital, Bucharest, as "Nebunia" ("Madness"). Some of these poems were illustrated with drawings in Relgis' own hand.
From "Umanitatea" to "Mântuirea".
After training in architecture, Relgis was enrolled at the University of Bucharest, where he took courses in Philosophy. During the period, he first left Romania on a trip to the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Greece. He interrupted his studies shortly after Romania entered the war, in the second half of 1916. Back in Iaşi after the Central Powers stormed into southern Romania, he was reportedly drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, but refused to take up arms as a conscientious objector; briefly imprisoned as a result, he was in the end discharged for his deafness.
Resuming his publishing activity upon the end of war, Eugen Relgis began publicizing his humanitarianist and pacifist agenda. In summer 1918, Relgis became one of the contributors to the Iaşi-based review "Umanitatea" ("The Humanity" or "The Human Race"). Historian Lucian Boia, who notes that "Umanitatea" was published when Romania's temporary defeat seemed to announce sweeping political reforms, believes that the magazine mainly reflected the "nebulous" agenda of a senior editor, the Bessarabian journalist Alexis Nour. In addition to Relgis and Nour, "Umanitatea" enlisted contributions from Ludo and Avram Steuerman-Rodion. The short-lived magazine, Boia writes, supported land reform, labor rights and, unusually in the context of "pronounced Romanian antisemitism", Jewish emancipation. On his own, Relgis published a magazine of the same title, issued during 1920. According to one account, "Umanitatea" was closed down by Romania's military censorship, which kept a check on radical publications. In 1921, an unsigned chronicle in the Cluj-based "Gândirea" journal recognized in Relgis "the kind and enthusiastic young man who was propagating [...] the religion of man through "Umanitatea" magazine".
Relgis resumed his literary activity early in the interwar period. He authored his ideological essay "Literatura războiului şi era nouă" (Bucharest, 1919); another such piece, "Umanitarism sau Internaţionala intelectualilor" ("Humanitarianism or the Intellectuals' Internationale"), taken up by "Viaţa Românească" in 1922. "Viaţa Românească" also published Relgis' abridged translation of "The Biology of War", a pacifist treatise by German physician Georg Friedrich Nicolai. 1922 witnessed the birth of Relgis' manifesto "Principiile umanitariste" ("Humanitarianist Principles"), which offered Relgis' own conclusions on world peace, while reaffirming the need to create an international pacifist forum of intellectuals. It carried a preface by Nicolai.
Relgis also set up the First Humanitarianist Group of Romania, as well as a leftist library, "Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea" ("Freedom Circle Library"). Joined in such efforts by the veteran anarchists Han Ryner and Panait Muşoiu, Relgis also circulated an "Apel către toţi intelectualii liberi şi muncitorii luminaţi" ("Appeal to All the Free Intellectuals and the Enlightened Workers"). Before 1932, the Humanitarianist Group created some 23 regional branches in Greater Romania. Beginning 1925, Relgis also represented Romanian pacifists within the War Resisters' International.
In the meantime, he continued to publish sporadic poems, such as "Ascetism" ("Asceticism"), featured in "Gândirea". The year 1923 witnessed the beginnings of a friendship between Relgis and the aspiring pacifist author George Mihail Zamfirescu. Relgis prefaced Zamfirescu's book "Flamura albă" ("The White Flag"), and contributed to Zamfirescu's magazine "Icoane Maramureşene" ("Maramureş Icons"). A prose volume, "Peregrinări" ("Wanderings"), saw print with Editura Socec the same year. Relgis also published, in 1924, the 3 volumes of his main novel "Petru Arbore" (a "Bildungsroman" named after its main protagonist). Two new volumes of his topical essays saw print in later years: the first one, published by the printing offices of fellow journalist Barbu Brănişteanu, was "Umanitarism şi socialism" ("Humanitarianism and Socialism", 1925); the second, printed in 1926, was titled "Umanitarismul biblic" ("Humanitarianism in the Bible"). His press activity included contributions to Zionist papers: a writer for "Ştiri din Lumea Evreiască", he was also briefly on the staff of Zissu's "Mântuirea".
"Sburătorul" and "Umanitarismul".
Also during the early 1920s, Eugen Relgis came into contact with the Bucharest-based "Sburătorul" circle, which stood for modernist literature and aesthetic relativism. The eponymous magazine published samples of his lyrical poetry. With his humanitarian literature, Relgis was a singular figure among the many "Sburătorul" factions, as later noted by literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu in discussing the studied eclecticism of "Sburătorul" doyen Eugen Lovinescu. Another Romanian researcher, Henri Zalis, notes that Relgis was one of the many Jewish intellectuals whom Lovinescu cultivated in reaction to the tradition of ethno-nationalist discrimination. However, according to critic Eugen Simion, Lovinescu also greatly exaggerated Relgis' literary worth.
Relgis' contribution to Romanian literature was renewed in 1926, when he published "Melodiile tăcerii" ("Melodies of Silence") and the collection "Poezii" ("Poems"), followed in 1927 by "Glasuri în surdină" ("Muted Voices"). The latter novel, later republished with a foreword by Austrian author Stefan Zweig, chronicled Relgis' own difficulties with his post-lingual deafness.
At that stage in his career, Eugen Relgis was also a contributor to the Bucharest left-wing dailies "Adevărul" and "Dimineaţa", part of a new generation of radical or pacifist authors cultivated by the newspaper (alongside Zamfirescu, Ion Marin Sadoveanu and various others). His pieces for "Adevărul" include insights into medical sociology, such as the September 1922 "Înapoi, la biologie!" ("Back to Biology!"). The "Adevărul" publishing house issued his 1925 translation of Knut Hamsun's story "Slaves of Love". At around the same time, the Căminul Library, publishers of popular education books, issued Relgis' translation from "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", the classic novel of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It endured as one of two Romanian-language versions of Nietzsche's main works to be published before the 1970s, together with George B. Rateş's "The Antichrist". Relgis' work as a translator also included versions of writings by Zweig, Émile Armand, Selma Lagerlöf, Emil Ludwig and Jakob Wassermann.
After editing the short-lived gazette "Cugetul Liber" ("Freethought"), Eugen Relgis put out the political and cultural review "Umanitarismul" ("Humanitarianism"). It enlisted contributions from the Romanian writers Ion Barbu, Alexandru Al. Philippide and Ion Vinea, and was positively reviewed by other cultural figures (Tudor Arghezi, Enric Furtună, Meyer Abraham Halevy, Perpessicius). He published his work in a variety of periodicals, from Vinea's modernist mouthpiece "Contimporanul", Ludo's "Adam" review and the Zionist "Cuvântul Nostru" to the Romanian traditionalist journal "Cuget Clar". With his publishing house Editura Umanitatea, Relgis also contributed a 1929 book of interviews, based on texts previously featured in "Umanitarismul": "Anchetă asupra internaţionalei pacifiste" ("An Inquiry about the Pacifist International"). The same year, Relgis lectured at the Zionist Avodah circle about the opportunities of Jewish return to the Land of Israel.
Travels abroad and "Şantier" affiliation.
The Romanian writer traveled extensively to promote his ideas of social change. By 1928, he was in regular correspondence with French writer and human rights activist Romain Rolland, who answered in writing to Relgis' various inquiries. He was a delegate to pacifist reunions in Hoddesdon, England and Sonntagberg, Austria (1928). Relgis also exchanged letters with various other prestigious left-wing intellectuals: Zweig, Upton Sinclair, Henri Barbusse, Max Nettlau etc. His various inquiries also enlisted positive replies from other international supporters of pacifism: physicist Albert Einstein, biologist Auguste Forel, writer Heinrich Mann and anarchist militant Paul Reclus. He became a contributor to Sebastien Faure's "Anarchist Encyclopedia", with the "Humanitarianism" entry. In 1929, Delpeuch company published his French-language essay "L'Internationale pacifiste" ("The Pacifist International"), reissued the same year in Valencia, Spain, as "La Internacional Pacifista".
Around 1930, Relgis was in Paris, where he met with Han Ryner, and in Berlin, where he conversed with his mentor Nicolai. In its new translated editions, "Apel către..." was signed by a number of leading pacifist intellectuals of various persuasions, among them Zweig, Sinclair, Barbusse, Campio Carpio, Manuel Devaldès, Philéas Lebesgue, Rabindranath Tagore. While in France, where his work was notably popularized by "L'EnDehors" magazine and Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers's "Bibliothèque de l'Artistocratie" book collection, he was for a while close to Barbusse's "Clarté" circle, but left it after discovering its communist militancy and Soviet connections. His Intellectuals' Internationale therefore took distance from both the Comintern and the International Working Union of Socialist Parties.
In 1932, he published the German-language collection of interviews "Wege zum Friede" ("Path toward Peace"). His other travels into Bulgaria, where he represented Romanian vegetarians at an international congress, were discussed in his 1933 volume "Bulgaria necunoscută" ("Unknown Bulgaria"). The volume "Cosmometápolis", about the creation of a world government, was first published in Bucharest by Cultura Poporului imprint, and reissued in Paris by Mignolet et Storz.
Relgis' participation in left-wing causes was attacked at home by the antisemitic and proto-fascist National Christian Defense League, whose press organ "Înfrăţirea Românească" alleged that "squire Siegler" and his "Umanitarismul", together with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, were fostering communist agitation. After the 1933 establishment of a Nazi regime in Germany, Relgis' books of interviews became subject to ceremonial burnings.
By that moment in his career, Relgis became a contributor to "Vremea" newspaper and to Ion Pas' political and art magazine, "Şantier". The latter periodical was close to the Romanian Social Democratic Party, and had a strongly anti-fascist agenda. It published, in 1932, the Relgis essay "Europa cea tânără" ("Young Europe"), which talked about civilization, imperialism and war. Relgis' contributions to "Şantier" also include a January 12, 1934 essay about "anonymous works" and their impact on art history, which was later quoted in "Viaţa Românească". The same year, Relgis published the novel "Prieteniile lui Miron" ("Miron's Friendships") with Editura Cugetarea.
In his subsequent activity as a journalist and publisher, Relgis combined his humanitarianism with topical interests. He was by then an advocate of eugenics, an interest reflected in his 1934 (or 1935) tract "Umanitarism şi eugenism" ("Humanitarianism and Eugenism"), published by Editura Vegetarianismul company. In 1936, he also released the collection "Esseuri despre iudaism" ("Essays on Judaism") with Cultura Poporului. He was at the time active within the Jewish Cultural Institute, an annex of the Bucharest Choral Temple. His international activity peaked during the Spanish Civil War, when he helped organize anarchist support for the Spanish Republican regime, elected Councilor of the International Antifascist Solidarity.
World War II, persecution and departure.
Eugen Relgis was still active on the literary scene during the first two years of World War II, before Romania formalized its military alliance with the Axis Powers. The Phoney War caught him in France, but he returned to Romania shortly after, exposing himself to persecution by the growing Romanian fascist movements. In February 1940, he gave a retrospective lecture, republished by the newspaper "L'Indépendence Roumaine", on the work of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Another book of his political prose, "Spiritul activ" ("The Active Spirit"), saw print the same year.
The emergence of antisemitic and fascist regimes ("see Romania in World War II, Holocaust in Romania") signified the beginning of Relgis' marginalization. During the short-lived National Legionary State, established by the Iron Guard fascists between 1940 and early 1941, the author lived in seclusion. His "Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea" was banned in 1940, but Relgis secretly moved the books into a stable. After the Guard fell from power, the Ion Antonescu dictatorship still included Relgis on a nationally-circulated list of banned Romanian Jewish authors, but Relgis continued to write. His texts of the time include a posthumous praise of his pacifist disciple Iosif Gutman, the son of a Bucharest rabbi, who had been killed during the Bucharest pogrom. The essay was planned as part of Rabbi Gutman's volume "Slove de martiri" ("Notes by Martyrs"), which, although anti-Guard, was not given Antonescu's imprimatur. Relgis was however able to publish an article in the Jewish-only magazine "Renaşterea Noastră", on the occasion of Iosif's "yahrtzeit", where he compared the Gutmans to Laocoön and His Sons. Relgis' own son fled Romania in 1942, and settled in Argentina.
A final period in Relgis' Romanian activity came after the August 1944 Coup toppled Antonescu and denounced Romania's Axis alliance. In 1945, he was dedicated a public celebration at the Jewish Cultural Institute, which included a speech by Chief Rabbi Alexandru Şafran. "Slove de martiri" was eventually published that year, and a revised Romanian edition of "Petru Arbore" saw print in 1946. Also then, he completed work on an essay about Nazism, The Holocaust and sexuality: "Eros în al treilea Reich" ("Eros in the Third Reich"). Relgis was again active in the political press, lending his signature to several independent newspapers: Sebastian Şerbescu's "Semnalul", Tudor Teodorescu-Branişte's "Jurnalul de Dimineaţă" etc. He described himself as diametrically opposed to the process of communization, as well as to the Soviet occupation of Romania.
With refugee status, having reportedly been singled out for arrest by the Romanian Communist Party officials, Relgis departed from Romania in 1947, shortly before the communist regime took hold. After a brief stay in Paris, he spent some time in Argentina, with his son and his female companion Ana Taubes. He later went to Montevideo, in Uruguay, where he lived the remainder of his life. At home, his works were included in an official "Publicaţii interzise" ("Works Forbidden from Publishing") list, published by the communist censorship apparatus.
During his last decades, Eugen Relgis dedicated himself to sociological research and political activism. He embarked on a series of university lectures, which carried him throughout Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. In 1950, he founded an international anarchist archive in Montevideo, reportedly one of the few political libraries in South America at the time of its creation. The effort was supported by the exiled Spanish anarchist Abraham Guillén, and received documentary funds from Europe, but reputedly drew suspicion from Uruguay police forces, and was consequently shut down.
South American career.
With noted help from anarchist translator Vladimiro Muñoz, Relgis began his new career as a Spanish-language writer and publicist with a succession of works. "Umanitarism şi eugenism" was translated into a Spanish edition: "Humanitarismo y eugenismo", Ediciones Universo, Toulouse, 1950. The same imprint released his essay "Las aberraciones sexuales en la Alemania nazi" ("Sexual Aberrations in Nazi Germany"), which discussed in some depth the characteristics of Nazi eugenics. Also in 1950, with his Montevideo printing office Ediciones Humanidad, Relgis released a Spanish edition of his "Principiile", a version of Max Nettlau's "World Peace" volume, as well as reissuing "Cosmometápolis". Two years later, Ediciones Humanidad published Relgis' biographical essay "Stefan Zweig, cazador de almas" ("Stefan Zweig, the Soul Hunter"), followed in 1953 by a Hachette version of "De mis peregrinaciones europeas" ("From My Wanderings in Europe"). Relgis also tried to get his contributions translated into Portuguese, asking anarchist philosopher José Oiticica for assistance. He was at the time employed by "El Plata" daily, editing its Wednesday literary page, and helping to discover, in 1954, the twelve-year-old poetess Teresa Porzecanski.
In 1954, Relgis printed another biographical study, on Romain Rolland: "El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria" ("A Free Man Confronts Totalitarian Barbarity"). The following year, he gave a public lecture at the University of the Republic, titled "A Writer's Confession", and reissued "Esseuri despre iudaism" as "Profetas y poetas. Valores permanentes y temporarios del judaísmo" ("Prophets and Poets. The Permanent and Timely Values of Judaism"). A Spanish version of "Umanitarism sau Internaţionala intelectualilor" was published, as "El Humanitarismo", by Editorial Americalee in Buenos Aires (1956). One edition of the latter was prefaced by Nicolai, who was at the time living in Argentina. In November 1956, the same company issued Relgis' "Diario de otoño" ("Autumn Diary"), a collection of notes he had kept during the war years. Another tract, "Albores de libertad" ("Dawns of Freedom"), was prefaced by Rudolf Rocker, the anarcho-syndicalist thinker.
In 1958, the University of the Republic published Eugen Relgis' acclaimed political essay "Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica" ("Cultural Perspectives in South America"), for which he received a prize from the Uruguayan Ministry of Public Instruction and Social Prevision. Relgis' reputation was consolidated in the intellectual circles and, in 1955, his name was unsuccessfully advanced for the Nobel Peace Prize. The same year, a volume of his collected Spanish texts and studies on his work was published in Montevideo, as "Homenaje a Eugen Relgis en su 60º aniversario" ("Homage to Eugen Relgis on His 60th Anniversary").
Relgis returned to poetry in 1960 and 1961, with the volumes "En un lugar de los Andes" ("Some Place in the Andes") and "Locura" ("Madness"), both translated by Pablo R. Troise. They were followed by two other booklets, also in Troise's translation: "Corazones y motores" ("Hearts and Engines", 1963), "Últimos poemas" ("The Last Poems", 1967). His complete "Obras" ("Works") were published over the next decades, while the essay "¿Qué es el humanitarismo? Principios y acción" ("What Is Humanitarianism? Principles and Action") went through several successive editions and featured a prologue by Albert Einstein. Another one of Relgis' Spanish-language volumes, "Testigo de mi tiempo" ("A Witness of My Time"), with more essays on Judaism, came in 1961. His leading eugenics and sexology treatise, "Historia sexual de la Humanidad" ("The Sexual History of Humanity"), was also published in 1961 (Libro-Mex Editores, Mexico City), and, in 1965, his biography of Nicolai saw print in Buenos Aires.
Final years and death.
In 1962, Eugen Relgis visited Israel and Jerusalem, tightening his links with the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David Şafran. It was in Israel that Relgis published another volume of memoirs, in his native Romanian language: "Mărturii de ieri şi de azi" ("Testimonies of Yesterday and Today"). In 1972, he was made an honorary staff member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
From the early 1960s, Relgis was in correspondence with figures in the Italian radical circles, such as the anarchist Gaspare Mancuso. In 1964, Mancuso and Regis' other Italian disciples founded the political journal "Quaderini degli amici di Eugen Relgis" ("The Friends of Eugen Relgis Notebooks"). He also became an occasional contributor to "Mujeres Libres", the Spanish anarcha-feminist tribune in the United Kingdom. During the 1960s and '70s, as a spell of liberalization occurred in Nicolae Ceauşescu's Romania, Relgis was again in contact with Romanian intellectuals. Before the massive earthquake of 1977 devastated Bucharest, he was in regular correspondence with scholar Mircea Handoca.
Eugen Relgis lived the final decade of his life as a pensioner of the Uruguayan state—in 1985, a law raised his "pensión graciable" to 20,000 new pesos a month. In the 1980s, Relgis was exchanging letters with Romanian cultural historian Leon Volovici, and entertained thoughts about a recovery of his work by Romanian critics and historians. He died before this could happen, in Montevideo, at age 92.
Political doctrine.
Main ideas.
Throughout his career, Relgis was the proponent of anarchism. The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of "state fetishism", seeking to overturn it and create "universal fraternity", and, in "Diario de otoño", postulated a necessary distinction between Law ("which may be interpreted for or against") and Justice ("elementary" and unavoidable). Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled "the three idols: State, Property, Money." Political philosopher Ángel Cappelletti argues: "Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to libertarian ideas".
According to Stefan Zweig, Relgis fought "tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity." The sentiment was echoed by Romain Rolland, who recognized in Relgis his disciple: "There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and universalist idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being." Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian George Călinescu observed Relgis' anti-establishment and anti-artistic rhetoric, but described it as mere "idealist reverie", "without any daring proposals that would threaten our self-preservation instincts". Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as "an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems", "a practical and not a utopian thinker", and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved.
Relgis' humanitarianism (also known as humanism or pan-humanism; ) was a practical extension of anarcho-pacifism. William Rose describes this doctrine as both "universalist and pacifist", noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things "which separate man from man and cause wars". Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of "active thought", and "a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities", while expressing admiration for the nonviolent resistance tactics advocated in British India by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or Rabindranath Tagore. At the time, he attacked all forms of pan-nationalism, from Pan-Germanism to Pan-European nationalism, defining pan-humanism as "the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species". In "El humanitarismo", he called all internationalist movements, except his own, corrupted by "the practice of violence and intolerance".
Writing in 1933, the leftist literary columnist Ion Clopoţel stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with "a lively, dynamic and innovating socialism". Although left-wing, Relgis' vision also incorporated militant anti-communism. As noted by literary historian Geo Şerban, he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of "social revolutions" and Bolshevik insurgency. In the first issue of "Umanitarianismul", Relgis criticized both the far right and the far left, noting that his ideology was "apolitical, in fact antipolitical". In "Europa cea tânără", he referred to the Soviet Union as the home of "proletarian imperialism". These thoughts were detailed by "Diario de otoño", which drew a direct comparison between the Red Army, pushing Romania into an "armed peace", and the Wehrmacht.
Judaism, Zionism, Jewish culture.
Beginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of Zionism, convinced that the path of Jewish assimilation was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents. He also adhered to philosopher Martin Buber's ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by diaspora Jews: universalism, Zionism and Conservative Judaism. In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the Land of Israel, and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the Palestine Arabs. In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, "being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist." However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow "the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism." The writer also described himself as committed to Romanian culture, and, as late as 1981, noted that Romanian was still his language of choice.
His essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David) speak about the threat of societal collapse, which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after World War I. His theory on "dehumanization" postulated: "the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms." As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose monotheism and Messianism he decoded the basic representation of moral responsibility, and the immediate precursors of Christianity. The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of Jewish ethics which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the Bible as "that most humane book", and identifying himself with the lament of Malachi 2:10 ("Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?"). He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive "the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith", with creating "new values from the old ones". Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: "Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe."
In tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where bigotry, and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric. He reserved special criticism for the notions of a "vengeful God" and "Jewish chosenness", arguing that they are "primitive", and expressed more sympathy for Buddhist universalism. His texts, including the 1922 "Apel către...", are thought by some to be purposefully reusing the pro-universalist vocabulary of Freemasons.
Relgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet Moses, in whom he sees the symbol of "great human aspirations". Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from Baruch Spinoza to Charles Darwin), others talk about secular Jewish culture, and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, Edmond Fleg, Theodor Herzl. As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the modern art of Marcel Janco, Lazăr Zin or Reuven Rubin, and in the literature of Zweig, S. Ansky, Mendele Mocher Sforim and even Marcel Proust. Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from A. L. Zissu and Iosif Brucǎr to Avram Steuerman-Rodion and Enric Furtună. According to Geo Şerban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting "a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world."
A critic of antisemitism, Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of anti-fascism. Early on, he exposed claims about Judeo-Masonic domination as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture. He wrote: "I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a phobia, that is to say an obsession. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world—and all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession."
Writing in 1946, shortly after the scale of The Holocaust became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that Nazis fabricated human soap. Historian of ideas Andrei Oişteanu analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.
On Latin America.
After his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on Latin America as a "neohumanist" continent. Earlier, in "Europa cea tânără", Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its "pathetic history" of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of Eastern philosophy and United States models of industrialization. Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's "spiritual renunciations" were mirrored by a "cancer of machinism" in North America.
With "Perspectivas culturales en Sudamérica", he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a Latin American culture was still ahead. Relgis identified this as a merit, describing South America in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a "healthier" example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the Cold War era. Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: "the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world." Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and "utilitarian mentality", while fighting the "false moral" of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism. Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist José Enrique Rodó.
Relgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was Argentine poet and historian Arturo Capdevila, who wrote about Relgis as a "meritorious" visionary with a "grave and vital message", assuring him: "You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied." Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included Socialist Party leader Emilio Frugoni, Colorado Party politician Amílcar Vasconcellos, Zionist academic Joel Gak and poet Carlos Sabat Ercasty. While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of Antigone, Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with "the constricting reality". Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agustín Courtoisie calls Relgis "eccentric and genial", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in Jorge Luis Borges' fantasy literature.
Eugenics.
Like other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of "social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement." Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for eugenics, advocating universal birth control and compulsory sterilization in cases of "degeneration". According to Agustín Courtoisie: "Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with name="acpensador"/> In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated neo-Malthusians, and especially with Manuel Devaldès. He praised Devaldès' call for vasectomy as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure "a true revolution" in population growth. His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and Pierre Ramus. According to Romanian biomedicine historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, "forced [eugenic sterilization into the realm of public debate".
Turda also notes that "Umanitarism şi eugenism" went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the involuntary euthanasia of "degenerate" individuals: those with "pathological characteristics or incurable diseases." Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: "It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived." His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually "prolific", but otherwise "degenerate", individuals. To this goal, he supported abortion, both for eugenic and pro-choice reasons. Relgis also argued: "Instead of natural selection, man should practice rational selection." With "Las aberraciones sexuales...", Relgis condemned Nazi eugenics as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as "sub-humans" needed to be reeducated and (if "incurable") sterilized by non-Nazi physicians.
In this context, Relgis identified multiracial society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a future American racial type. In this, Relgis saw the "integral man" of his humanitarianism, "healthy and strong", with a mind unbound by "super-refined culture", and without the traumatic experience of "tyrannical ideologies". The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but "more universal" than, the Cosmic Race theory of Mexican academic José Vasconcelos.
Literary contribution.
Literary style and principles.
Eugen Relgis blended a critique of capitalism, advocacy of internationalism and modern art interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and "all too cerebral" novels, George Călinescu argues, Eugen Relgis was "obsessed with humanitarianism" and self-help techniques. With his 1934 piece for "Şantier", Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, individualist one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works ("the pyramid, the temple, the cathedral"), often demanding "the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations." Presently, he thought, the combat against the "imperative of Profit" and "vulgar materialism" justified the "ethical and aesthetic individualism". Relgis' essay described industrial society in harsh terms, as directed by "the bloody gods" of "Capitalism and War", and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to kitsch ("serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days"). Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, "needs to be the expression of length and depth."
Some of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at "Fronda". Its art manifestos, described by Paul Cernat as "virtually illegible", announced radical ideals, such as art for art's sake through Neronian destruction: "Qualis artifex pereo". Leon Baconsky, a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all "Frondistes" were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist Remy de Gourmont, to whom Cernat adds philosopher Henri Bergson and Epicurean thinker Jean-Marie Guyau (both of them dedicated "prolix-metaphoric commentary" in the review's pages). In matters of poetics, the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of Tudor Arghezi (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three "Fronda" issues) and, to a lesser extent, Ion Minulescu—according to Baconsky, "Fronda" was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon.
The cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic Pompiliu Păltânea, believed that, with his contribution to Romanian literature, Relgis was part of a diverse anti-war "ideological" group of writers (alongside Felix Aderca, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voineşti, Barbu Lăzăreanu and some others). According to Călinescu, Relgis' literary ideal became "the living book", the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such "idols" as Rolland, Zweig, Henri Barbusse, Heinrich Mann and Ludwig Rubiner. An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European Expressionism, in fashion at the start of Relgis' career.
In addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to travel literature, deemed "his most characteristic works" by William Rose. These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: Ion Clopoţel noted that, in his volume about interwar Bulgaria, Relgis went beyond the facade of "savage" Bulgarian militarism to depict the humanist, vegetarian and "Tolstoyan" civil society of that age. "Bulgaria necunoscută" also worked as a manifesto of anti-intellectualism, chastising the "demagogue" academics and praising the simplicity of "collective life". In a similar way, Relgis' scattered memoirs, among them "Strămoşul meu, "David Gugumanul"" ("My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' "), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism.
Other such didactic texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. "Glasuri în surdină" is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' alter ego, Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life. However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron "is not really representative of the deaf majority", leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness. Relgis' patron Eugen Lovinescu was especially critical of the work, judging its "self-analyzing" internal monologue as burdensome.
The "Bildungsroman" "Petru Arbore" is noted by Geo Şerban as a "rarity" in Romanian literature, "instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism." Eugen Lovinescu notes its traditional theme of social "inadaptation", which, to him, echoes the right-wing didacticism of "Sămănătorul" writers. Over the three volumes, the idealistic Arbore falls in love with women of various conditions, and, to the backdrop of World War I, tries to build a business as an army supplier. Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his autobiography, but as the "spiritual mirror" of each reader. Lovinescu believed the work to be heavily influenced by Rolland's "Jean-Christophe", lacking "inventiveness".
Called a "sweet volume of essays" by Clopoţel, "Prieteniile lui Miron" chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, "who mistakes love for sport", being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship. Clopoţel praised the text for its "seriousness", "finesse" and "reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility", concluding: "is a literature of moral health."
These characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to Latin American literature. Courtoisie found "Diario de otoño", a book that is "miscellaneous, multithematic, between the poetic and the everyday", comparable to the "Fermentario" essays of Uruguay's Carlos Vaz Ferreira. According to critic William T. Starr, "El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria" and other such recollections reveal "more about Relgis than about Rolland".
Poetry.
During his time at "Fronda", Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published collective, experimental and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Cernat, "aesthetically monstrous". This perspective is echoed by Şerban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without "convincing results". In "Triumful nefiinţei", the main stylistic reference was, according to Lovinescu, the Romanian Symbolist prose poet Dimitrie Anghel, imitated to the point of "pastiche".
With time, Relgis developed a style deemed "the poetry of professions" by George Călinescu. According to Călinescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists Alexandru Tudor-Miu and Barbu Solacolu, but also to Simona Basarab, Leon Feraru, Cristian Sârbu and Stelian Constantin-Stelian. The same critic notes that Relgis "attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters." Lovinescu describes the poet in Relgis as one who "survived" through humanitarian propaganda, returning "in a compact Verhaeren form, rhetorical and accumulative." Lovinescu includes the resulting works in a category of "descriptive" and "social" poems, relating Relgis to Feraru, Alice Călugăru, Aron Cotruş, Vasile Demetrius, Camil Petrescu and I. Valerian.
Relgis' poems, Călinescu notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery ("The Elevator", "The Cement Mixer") or workers ("The Builder", "The Day Laborer"), as temples and deities; by "natural association", the critic suggests, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals ("The Giraffe", "The Elephant"), but "this requires greater means of suggestion". In one piece quoted by George Călinescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a scaffolding structure:
Legacy.
The political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the Romanian Revolution of 1989: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by "four dictatorial regimes in his native country". Before this, Şerban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of "opinion maker". Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as "almost forgotten" by Romanians after his self-exile. In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included Fălticeni journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle. According to literary historians such as Victor Frunză and Al. Săndulescu, Relgis' targeting by communist censorship had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general.
Attempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community. In April 1982, the Jewish cultural journal "Revista Cultului Mozaic" published Leon Volovici's note about Relgis and Judaism. Late in the 1980s, Volovici also contacted Relgis' surviving sisters, then Relgis himself, becoming curator of the manuscripts left behind by the philosopher upon his relocation to South America. These were later donated to the Alexandru Al. Philippide Institute of the Romanian Academy, where they are kept as the Eugen Relgis library fund.
Relgis enjoys a more enduring reputation abroad. Initially, his anarchist eugenics enjoyed some popularity among Spanish anarchists; his pacifism also inspired Llorenç Vidal Vidal, the Balearic poet and educator. Some of his tracts have been reissued after 2001, with the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo). Italian-language versions of his novels, poems and political tracts, including "Cosmometápolis", were published by Gaspare Mancuso and his Libero Accordo group, over the 1960s and '70s.
By then, Relgis' works had been translated into fourteen languages, although they still remained largely unknown in the United States; "Principiile umanitariste" alone had been translated into some 18 languages before 1982. The popularization of Relgis' ideas in America was first taken up by reviews such as "The Humanist" and "Books Abroad", while Oriole Press reprinted "Muted Voices". A second revised edition of "Profetas y poetas", prefaced by the Spanish intellectual Rafael Cansinos-Asséns, saw print in Montevideo (1981). At around the same time, in Mexico, his poems were being reprinted in Alfonso Camín's "Norte" literary review.
In addition to the Philippide Institute collection, part of Relgis' personal archive is being preserved in Jerusalem, at the National Library of Israel. His other notebooks and letters are kept in the Netherlands, at the International Institute of Social History. Relgis' likeness is preserved in drawings by Marcel Janco, Lazăr Zin, Louis Moreau and Carmelo de Arzadun.

Pati Kremer

Pati Kremer (1867–1943) was a Russian socialist and pioneer of the General Jewish Workers' Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Bund). She was the wife of Arkadi Kremer.
Biography.
Pati Kremer was born Matla Srednicki, on January 2, 1867 in Vilna. She was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. In the 1880s she moved to St. Petersburg to study dentistry and there became involved with revolutionary political circles. She was also active in educational and literacy projects for workers. In 1889 she was arrested for the first time. Upon her release, she returned to Vilna, where she became a leading member and organizer of the Jewish Social-Democratic circle known as the 'Vilna Group', together with John Mill (1870–1952) and Arkadi Kremer (1865–1935). Pati and Arkadi were subsequently married.
The Vilna Group was one of the precursors of the Bund and of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP). Pati Kremer was arrested again in September 1897 and banished to Mogilev. There she resumed her activities on behalf of the Bund, working with other political exiles and local workers. In 1898 she secretly attended the second congress of the Bund in Kovno. In 1902, she and Arkadi (who had been arrested in 1898) escaped abroad, making their way to Britain, the USA, Switzerland and France. They mostly remained in France until 1921, becoming French citizens and working with the French Socialist Party as well as the Bund.
In 1921, the Kremers returned to Vilna, where Arkadi became chairman of the local branch of the Bund. Pati Kremer worked as editor and translator in the publishing house of Boris Kletskin (1875–1937), a Bundist. In 1935, her husband died, and she began work on a commemorative volume eventually published in New York in 1942. During the German occupation of Vilna in the Second World War she became a leading figure in the city's Jewish ghetto, organizing and maintaining secret Yiddish libraries and clandestine meetings of the Bund. When the Ghetto was razed by the Germans in September 1943, Pati Kremer as among the many victims who were rounded up, transported to the Sobibor extermination camp and killed.

Polish–Mongolian literary relations

Polish–Mongolian literary relations are the interrelationships between Polish and Mongolian literature that date to the late Middle Ages. There are also links between Polish and Mongolian philology and literary studies. Their first manifestations were reports about Mongols in the Polish chronicles and in the relations of medieval Polish travelers to Asia. Knowledge about Mongolia in Poland became more vivid in the 19th century, when many Polish adventurers, prisoners in Siberia (see sybirak), learned people and businessmen of the part of Poland under Russian rule engaged heavily in Siberian, Mongolian, and Chinese affairs. Interest in Polish matters in Mongolia is smaller and dates mainly to the 20th century. There are also literary works (mainly adventure novels) about Mongolia in the Polish literature and a few translations of Polish literature into Mongolian, or Mongolian literature into Polish.
Early works.
There are numerous mentions of the Mongols in the writings of virtually all Polish chroniclers, notably Jan Długosz. From the 15th to the 18th centuries, Mongolian affairs were connected or identified in Poland directly with the severe devastation wrought on the country by the Mongol invasions from late 1240 to 1241, then again in 1259–1260 and in 1287–1288. Mongol tumen under Orda Khan devastated most of central Poland, besieged and sacked Lublin, Sandomierz, Wolbórz, Łęczyca, then turned south towards Sieradz and Wrocław. All the while, the armies of Baidar and Kadan ravaged the southern part of Poland including Chmielnik, the royal city of Kraków, Bytom, Opole, Legnica and others. Panic spread through the Polish lands. In 1259, mere 18 years after the first attack, two tumens of 40,000 men from the Golden Horde under the leadership of Berke, attacked Poland again. Most towns in Galicia and Volhyinia were burned to the ground. The Rus soldiers under Daniel's son, Lev, and brother, Vasily, joined the Mongol expedition. Here's where the Mongolian affairs became connected and identified in Poland with the Tatar issues. More death and destruction was unleashed on the cities of Lublin, Sieradz, Sandomierz, Zawichost, Kraków and Bytom. The Golden Horde remained very important in the literary tradition of Poland dating back to the Middle Ages. It inspired such works as a treatise on the origin of the Tatars by Mikołaj Rozembarski (1499).
Until the 19th century Polish–Mongolian relations were sporadic. Some of the earliest European mentions about the life, history and culture of the Mongols come from the travel reports from the journey to the Great Khan in the years 1245–47, written by Franciscan monks, members of the expedition prepared by the pope Innocent IV and headed by Giovanni da Pian del Carpine. One of the members of this expedition was Benedict of Poland. He wrote a short account of his journey, "De Itinere Fratrum Minorum ad Tartaros". An author of the more extensive account of this journey, based on Benedict's oral narrative, "Historia Tartarorum", was C. de Bridia, probably also a Pole. "Historia Tartarorum" contains an important description of the Battle of Legnica, one of the most important events during the Mongol invasion of Poland.
19th century.
The first nineteenth-century Polish traveler to Mongolia was Jan Potocki (1761–1815), who visited Mongolia during his journey to China and wrote a travel report in French (Polish translation "Podróże", 1959). The father of the Polish Mongolian philology was Józef Kowalewski, who visited Mongolia several times (1829, 1831–33). Kowalewski was a former filomata, a friend of Adam Mickiewicz, a professor of Mongolian philology at the University of Kazan, an author of several works devoted to very diverse aspects of Mongolian culture and language, often pioneering. His most important work is a Mongolian–Russian–French dictionary in three volumes (1844–49). Polish research on the geography and culture of Mongolia intensified after the January Uprising, when many Poles became political prisoners in neighboring Siberia – one of the most famous among Poles participating in the research expeditions to Mongolia was Aleksander Czekanowski.
20th century.
World famous among turkologists and mongolists was a Polish scholar Władysław Kotwicz, author of many works devoted to Mongolia and Mongolian literature, the discoverer (1912) of the old-Mongolian stone inscriptions in the Erdene Zuu Monastery. Other well-known Polish mongolists were Marian Lewicki, Stanisław Kałużynski and Stanisław Godziński. Lewicki prepared editions of many monuments of the classical Mongolian literature.
In 20th-century Mongolia there was interest in Polish literature, strengthened by the fact that both communist Mongolia and communist Poland belonged to the same political bloc. Many translations of Polish literary works into Mongolian were published, although they were usually translated indirectly, through the Russian language. Especially a large number of Polish children's literature was translated into Mongolian. However, most of these texts were published in magazines and not as books. Some Mongolian citizens studied Polish philology at Polish universities. Some translators translated literary works directly from Polish into Mongolian. Among the most important were D. Biambaa (poems of Władysław Broniewski and Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński), B. Bandi (Polish folk literature), P. Biambasan and D. Kim (novels by Ewa Szelburg-Zarembina). The most important translator was Byambyn Rinchen (1905–77): writer, historian, ethnographer and linguist, who translated into Mongolian many main literary works of many world literatures, including (directly from Polish) works of Adam Mickiewicz, Wanda Wasilewska, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz and Jerzy Andrzejewski. There are translations of his ethnographical books into Polish.
The number of translations of contemporary Mongolian literature into Polish is not very big. As in the case of translations from Polish to Mongolian, many texts were translated through the Russian language. To the most important belong "Opowiadania mongolskie" Stories by Tsendiin Damdinsüren (1953), "Wiersze" by Begzin Yavuuhulan (1962) and the novel "Przejrzysty Tamir" [The Crystal Clear Tamir River by Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba (1980). Translations directly from Mongolian were published mainly in the orientalist journal "Przegląd Orientalistyczny", for example poetry and prose of Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj translated by Stanisław Godziński and Adam Latusek. Godziński translated also a selection of Mongolian epic poetry and chronicles ("W kręgu lamajskich legend i mitów" lamaist legends and myths, 1981). To the most important translators of the classic Mongolian literature belongs Stanisław Kałużynski. He prepared "Głosy z Jurty" of the yurts (1960) – a selection of Mongolian riddles, parables, proverbs, etc.; "Tajna historia Mongołów" (1970), a translation of the anonymous thirteenth-century Mongolian chronicle "The Secret History of the Mongols"; "Tradycje i legendy ludów Mongolii" and legends of the peoples of Mongolia (1978), which include excerpts from the seventeenth-century chronicle "Erdeniin Tobchi" and Mongolian folk epic poetry. Among Polish writers, whose works were affected by the culture of Mongolia, were Wacław Sieroszewski – especially his novel "Dalaj Lama" Dalai Lama (1927) and its versions for children "W niepodległej Mongolii" the independent Mongolia (1937); Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski – especially his travel novel "Przez kraj ludzi, zwierząt i bogów" the country of people, animals and gods (1923); Kamil Giżycki ("Przez Urianchaj i Mongolię", 1929); Przecław Smolik, an author of the story on the life of Buryats "Wśród wyznawców Burchan-Buddhy" the believers of Burchan-Buddha (1925).

Spanish cruiser Tornado

The Tornado was a 2100-ton and maneuverable at 13 knots bark-rigged screw steam cruiser of the Spanish Navy, first launched at Clydebank, Scotland in 1863, as the Confederate raider "CSS Texas". She is most famous for having captured the North American filibustering ship "Virginius", which led to the "Virginius Affair" and to the Spanish-American Crisis of 1873.
Design and construction.
She was built as the Confederate raider "CSS Texas" but was seized by the British Government in 1863 and acquired in 1865. She was purchased by the Chilean government for 75,000 Pounds, through Isaac Campbell & Co, in February 1866. Being "officially" known as both the "Texas" and the "Canton", she was later given the name "Pampero" in an attempt to conceal her true identity.
In early 1862, Lt. George T. Sinclair was sent to England, with orders to build a "clipper propellor for cruising purposes", and to take command of her when she was ready for sea. His instructions were to confer with Commander Bulloch in Liverpool, as to the design of the vessel, and the building, fitting out and arming of her. Bulloch received orders to help Sinclair with funds and advice. He showed Sinclair the drawings and specifications for the CSS Alabama, also the contract with Lairds, and they both decided to use these as a basis for the new cruiser.
What Sinclair did was to arrange, with the help of the Southern diplomat James M. Mason, for an issue of bonds, each equal to 25 bales of cotton, weight 12,500 pounds. Seven individuals took up these bonds, and were effectively the owners of this new vessel. The new cruiser was contracted by James and George Thomson of Glasgow, in October 1862. The same firm that was contracted to build an ironclad ram for Lt. North. The "Pampero" was modelled on the Alabama, even though she was somewhat larger.
The "Pampero" was to be 231 feet in length, 33 feet in breadth, powered by both sail and steam. Bark rigged, she was equipped for cruising under canvas or steam, with telescopic funnels, and a raiseable screw. Similar, but larger engines to the Alabama were placed below the waterline for protection. Her frame was iron, with a mixture of iron and wood for the planking. Her armament was to be three 8-inch pivot guns, and a broadside battery of four or more guns. The original contract called for the Pampero to be ready for sea by July 1863, but the schedule could not be maintained. Guns and gun carriages were ordered, and Sinclair received £10,000 ($40,000) from Bulloch, and perhaps more. For his crew, Sinclair made arrangements for some men to come out from Baltimore. By the spring of 1863 Sinclair was becoming very concerned about the "Pampero", and feared that the British Government would not permit the departure of any vessel suspected to be Confederate.
He visited Paris to discuss with John Slidell the possibility of transferring the vessel to France. Slidell suggested Hamburg in Germany would be a better alernative. However, Sinclair investigated this, but did not proceed with it. Meanwhile the completion of the "Pampero" was further delayed by labour troubles, and the seizure of the "Alexandria", another Confederate vessel in production at Lairds, by the British Government. The Alexandria trial was indecisive, and Mason put off the launching of the Pampero "until a final verdict was reached."
The "Pampero" herself first came to the attention of Thomas H. Dudley, United States Consul in Liverpool, in the spring of 1863, when he made an investigative tour of Northern England and Scotland, looking for any warships being built for the Confederates. He learned that Thomsons were building a screw steamer "of about 1500 tons," designed for great speed. He was told that she was to have an angle-iron frame and teak planking, and he found that among the workmen it was generally believed that she was for the South.
On his next trip to Scotland in August 1863, his suspicions increased as new details on the vessel came to light. The builders insisted that the boat was for the Turkish Government, but Dudley`s informants in the yard insisted the boat was for the South, being supervised by the same men as those who supervised the building of the ironclad ram. Dudley left behind a spy in Thomsons yard, who soon reported that the vessel was rigged in the same manner as the Alabama, the drawings of which, he was told, were in Glasgow.
The "Pampero" by a Mrs. Galbraith, the vessel finally slid down the slipway on October 29, 1863. On November 10, the American consul in Glasgow, W. L. Underwood formally requested that the Pampero be detained. Although the British Government did not make any immediate legal moves, in late November a British warship was moored abreast of the Pampero, and she was placed under a 24 hour scrutiny by customs officers. Court proceedings against the Pampero commenced on March 18, 1864, and were never satisfactorily concluded.
Capture.
During the Chincha Islands War, the South American allies sent agents to European shipyards in search of unsold warships originally laid down for the Confederate states; Peru purchased two screw corvettes in France and Chile, purchased two in Britain, the Tornado and the Chilean corvette Abtao (1866) She set sail from Leith with a British register, British flag, with a British crew, after having been duly examined by the Custom-house authorities, on 19 August 1866. Bound for a neutral destination, she had no Chilean men on board.
She should have been in rendezvous with the British filibustering ship steamer "Greathem Hall", aiming to interfere against the Spanish trade. But the latter was captured by HMS Caledonia and taken into Portland. The "Pampero" (now named the "Tornado") waited patiently in the rendezvous point, until the crew were ordered to re-coal and head for the desolate islands of Fernando de Noronha, an old pirate haunt off the Brazilian coast, in order to collect unpaid wages and bonuses offered for the delivery of the vessel.
The Spanish frigate, brought strict orders from the Spanish government to capture these ships. However, the Peruvian vessels made it to Latin American waters but the Chilean "Pampero" was about to be captured. The "Gerona" sailed from Cadiz in the early morning of the 20th instant, arriving at Madeira, Portugal on the 22nd instant. At 6'15 in the evening; before arriving at the anchoring ground, she discovered a suspicious steamer weighing anchor and apparently getting ready to put to sea, for which reason the Commander of the "Gerona" Don Benito Escalera, thought fit to proceed towards her to see if he could obtains news, and to be at the same time in readiness to follow in her track, should she turn out to be ither of the vessels indicated to him by the Spanish government.
At 8 o'clock at night the frigate, thinking that she perceived that the "Tornado" was putting herself in motion, and having been confirmed in that opinion by the showing of the signal agreed upon on board the Spanish schooner, commenced to move in pursuit. The course which the "Tornado" took was in every way suspicious, for she kept as close into the north-west shore of this island as she could, coasting along it at a very short distance as far as Cape Tristão, where she put to sea steering towards the north.
Notwithstanding that the "Tornado" was some distance off at 10-30 at night, and at a distance of more than four miles from the coast, the Captain of the "Gerona", a slower ship, resolved to call her attention by discharging at her a cannon loaded with blank cartridge, but seeing that she kept on her course, he fired another shotted cannon at her, and this he repeated three times, the Tornado then stopped.
He sent on board of her tow boats manned and tow officers to examine her, which was done in due form, although it could not be affirmed positevely whether she carried munitions of war or not on account of the great quantity of coal with which she was stowed. The Commander made the captain come on board the "Gerona", and this latter answered the questions that were put to him with insolent and insulting words so that he was obliged to be called to order. He then ordered the said captain to return to the "Tornado", which was navigated to Cadiz by the 1st Lieutenant Don Manuel del Bustillo, 2nd Lieutenant, four midshipmen, one engineer, and 51 armed men, and the crew of the "Tornado" comprising 55 men, among whom were five Portuguese taken on board at Funchal, were transferred to the "Gerona".
Captain John MacPherson and the crew of the Tornado were treated with great severity, both on their way to Cádiz and after their arrival in that city. The case led to negotiations between the British and Spanish governments expressed the opinion that the Spanish Government had no right to treat the crew as prisoners of war, much less to chain them up.
Spanish Service.
She was brought into Spanish service as "Tornado," and rated as screw corvette. During the Ten Years' War, she saw service in Cuban Waters and had a notorious incident with the American filibustering steamer "Virginius", that had been bought for the purpose of being used for landing military expeditions on Cuba in aid of the insurgents, and she had been engaged in this work for months, being even called by one of the Havana newspapers as "the famous filibuster steamer Virginius".
On October 31, 1873 she was bound from Kingston, Jamaica to some point in Cuba, flying the American flag, and carrying a cargo of war material. Having a crew of 52 (chiefly Americans and Britons) and 103 passengers (mostly Cubans), the "Virginius" was sighted by the"Tornado", and she immediately fled in a northerly direction toward Jamaica, but was chased by her, captured and taken into Santiago de Cuba. Fifty-three of the crew and passengers were condemned to death by court-martial, and between November 4 and 8 were shot; among them were eight American citizens.
Relations between Spain and the United States became strained, and war seemed imminent, but on December 8, the Spanish government agreed to surrender the Virginius to the U.S. on December 16, to deliver the survivors of the crew and passengers to an American warship at Santiago, and to salute the American flag at Santiago on December 25 if it was not proved before that date that the Virginius was not entitled to sail under American colors. The Virginius foundered off Cape Hatteras as she was being towed to the United States, by the Ossipee. George Henry Williams, the Attorney General of the United States decided before December 25 that the Virginius was the property of General Quesada and other Cubans, and had had no right to carry the American flag.
Under an agreement of the February 27, 1875, the Spanish government paid to the United States an indemnity of $80,000 for the execution of the Americans, and another indemnity to the British government.
Resumed service.
She was converted to a torpedo-training vessel in 1886.
From 1898 until her destruction by the Nationalist aviation in 1938, she served as a hospice for poor children of sailors and fishermen killed or drowned in maritime accidents, in the port of Barcelona. She was finally broken up in 1939.

Steven Kunes

Steven Kunes (born 1956) is an American screenwriter, author, playwright, con man, forger and plagiarist. Kunes is a convicted felon.
Background and early career.
Kunes was born in 1956 in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and attended New York University.
Scriptwriting.
Kunes has written for "Salute to America's Pets" and "Cheers".
"Daily Variety" reported on June 10, 1992 that Kunes had sold a screenplay entitled "First Comes Love" for $1.2 million; no film was ever produced.
Fraud.
In 1982, Kunes attempted to sell to "People" magazine a fake interview with reclusive author J. D. Salinger, whom he had never met. Salinger sued and settled the case under the conditions that Kunes was "permanently enjoined from representing by any means that he is associated with or ever met Salinger", barred from "exhibiting, transmitting or exhibiting documents, writing or statements attributed to Salinger" and "required to collect and turn over any offending such documents or writings for destruction". The "interview" was never published. He later succeeded in selling a fake interview with Jimmy Buffett to the "Santa Barbara Daily Sound".
Steven Kunes was arrested on March 17, 2011 for purportedly swindling his friend, former Café Buenos Aires owner Wally Ronchietto, out of $2,000 for a movie deal that didn’t exist. On April 23, 2011, Noozhawk, a Santa Barbara online publication, announced that it has removed six of Kunes' articles from their digital archives as two contained plagiarized passages.
On August 27, 2011, a Santa Barbara judge issued a $200,000 bench warrant for his arrest when he failed to appear in court. Thought to have been hiding in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, he was apprehended in New Jersey less than a month later. 
At court, Kunes pleaded guilty and admitted to forging checks. 
On May 4, 2012, he was sentenced to five years in jail for felony commercial burglary and grand theft by false pretenses. A plea deal allowed for a sentence of only four years if Kunes had paid restitution to his victims, but no payments were made.
On February 25, 2013, Noozhawk, a Santa Barbara online news publisher, reported that Kunes had been arrested again. He had been serving his five year sentence and had been approved for electronic monitoring on August 1, 2012. Kunes removed the device on August 22, 2012 and mailed the device back to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. A photo posted on the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office Facebook photo page led to his identification at a Carpinteria cafe and his subsequent arrest.

The Tiger's Wife

"The Tiger's Wife" is the first novel by Téa Obreht, an American writer of Bosniak/Slovene origin. It was published in 2010 by Weidenfeld & Nicolson, a British imprint of Orion Books, and in 2011 by Random House in America.
Story.
"The Tiger's Wife" is set in an unnamed Balkan country, in the present and half a century ago, and features a young doctor's relationship with her grandfather and the stories he tells her, primarily about the 'deathless man' who meets him several times in different places and never changes, and a deaf-mute girl from his childhood village who befriends a tiger that has escaped from a zoo. It was largely written while she was at Cornell, and excerpted in "The New Yorker" in June 2009. Asked to summarize it by a university journalist, Obreht replied, "It's a family saga that takes place in a fictionalized province of the Balkans. It’s about a female narrator and her relationship to her grandfather, who's a doctor. It's a saga about doctors and their relationships to death throughout all these wars in the Balkans."
Reception.
The press reception has been good. The poet Charles Simic wrote in "The New York Review of Books" giving his endorsement to the view that "this is a remarkable first novel." He went on to say: "Téa Obreht is an extraordinarily talented writer, skilled at combining different types of narrative — from objective depiction of events to stories mixing the fabulous and the real — in a way that brings to mind the novels of Mikhail Bulgakov, Gabriel García Márquez, and Milorad Pavić, the Serbian author of "Dictionary of the Khazars". According to the "New Zealand Herald", "Reviewers have praised Obreht's vibrant imagery and skilful interweaving of fact and folklore, ritual and superstition. British paper the "Sunday Times" dubbed her 'a compelling new voice'; its rival the "Daily Telegraph" 'a natural born storyteller'." "New York Times" reviewer Liesl Schillinger praised the novel, saying it was "filled with astonishing immediacy and presence, fleshed out with detail that seems firsthand."
"The Tiger's Wife" won the prestigious British Orange Prize for Fiction in 2011. The annual prize, recognising "excellence, originality and accessibility in women's writing from throughout the world", then included £30,000 cash and the "Bessie", a limited edition bronze figurine. At 25 years, 9 months when the prize was announced, Obreht was the youngest winner (1996–2012).
Late in 2011 Obreht was a finalist for the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction and the University of Wales Dylan Thomas Prize for English-language writers age 18 to 30. "The Tiger's Wife" was a New York Times Bestseller that year.

St James' Church, Great Ormside

St James' Church, Great Ormside, is in the village of Great Ormside, Cumbria, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Appleby, the archdeaconry of Carlisle, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Lawrence, Appleby, St John the Baptist, Murton, St Peter, Great Asby, St Cuthbert, Dufton, and St Margaret and St James, Long Marton to form the Heart of Eden benefice. The church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. It stands on top of a circular mound overlooking the River Eden.
History.
The mound on which the church stands was a sacred site before the coming of Christianity, and was used as a burial place by the Vikings. The date of the first Christian church on the site is unknown, but the nave of the present church dates from the late 11th century. A north aisle was added and the chancel was widened in about the middle of the 12th century. The west tower was built in the following century. In the early 16th century the chancel was further enlarged, making it wider than the nave. The Hilton chapel was built in 1723, replacing the former north aisle. The church was restored in 1885–86 by C. J. Ferguson at a cost of £732 (£ as of ). During the restoration the north arcade was rebuilt, tracery was installed in the windows of the Hilton Chapel, and a new south doorway and porch were added to the west of the original doorway. In 1893 the tower was re-roofed.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The church is constructed in sandstone rubble. The roofs are slated on the south side, and covered in stone flags on the north. Its plan consists of a nave with a porch to the south and the Hilton Chapel to the north, a chancel wider than the nave, a north vestry, and a west tower. The nave measures by , and the chancel by . The tower is about square. The basic architectural style is Norman. The tower is in three stages, with large angular buttresses. It is defensive in nature, with no external doorway, three tiers of narrow lancet windows on the west and south sides, and without windows on the north side. The height of the tower has been reduced, with a few corbels of the former parapet remaining. It is surmounted by a pitched roof. On the south side of the church is a gabled porch, to the east of which is the original doorway, now partly blocked and with an inserted window. The original doorway is tall and narrow, with a round-arched head, and a blank tympanum. To the right of this are a round-headed window and a 14th-century two-light mullioned window. In the south wall of the chancel are three windows, with a doorway below the central window. The east window has three lights. The windows in the Hilton Chapel are round-headed.
Interior.
Inside the church is a tall, narrow, round-headed doorway leading into the tower, and an upper doorway, the latter being another defensive feature. Inside the tower is a basement and two internal floors. It contains two bells, but only one can be used. Between the nave and the chapel is a two-bay Norman arcade with round arches. In the chapel is a coat of arms dated 1723. In the north wall between the chapel and the chancel is a 14th-century hagioscope. The south wall of the chancel contains a combined aumbry and piscina in two recesses with semicircular heads. The font is Norman, and consists of a square bowl on a 19th-century base.
Churchyard.
In 1823 the Ormside bowl was discovered in the churchyard. This is an Anglo-Saxon bowl dating from the 7th or 8th century, and now held in the Yorkshire Museum. A further discovery was made in 1898, this being the burial of a Viking warrior and his sword. The sword is held in the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle. In the churchyard is the socket for a cross dated 1643. A new cross was added in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The cross and the socket are listed at Grade II.

Laboratory frame of reference

In physics, the laboratory frame of reference, or lab frame for short, is a frame of reference centered on the laboratory in which the experiment (either real or thought experiment) is done. This is the reference frame in which the laboratory is at rest. Also, this is usually the frame of reference in which measurements are made, since they are presumed (unless stated otherwise) to be made by laboratory instruments. An example of instruments in a lab frame, would be the particle detectors at the detection facility of a particle accelerator.

Vilna Group

The Vilna Group was a circle of Jewish Social-Democrats which met secretly in the city of Vilna, then part of the Russian empire (now Vilnius in Lithuania). The group was founded in the mid-1890s. Its members devoted themselves to disseminating Marxist and socialist literature to Jewish textile workers and to some extent to Jewish and non-Jewish workers generally, providing literacy and education classes for workers and supporting the formation of trade unions. They were among the first to produce socialist literature in Yiddish. All this was illegal and had to be done clandestinely, and all members of the Vilna Group were arrested at various points. The Vilna group included, among others, Arkadi Kremer and his wife Pati Kremer (a.k.a. Matla Srednicki or Srednitskaya), John Mill and Mikhail Liber. It was one of the precursors of the General Jewish Workers' Association in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (known as the 'Bund'), founded in 1897. The Vilna Group also played a role in founding the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP) in 1898. Most veterans of the Vilna Group later supported the Mensheviks.

St Mary's Church, Itchen Stoke

St Mary, Itchen Stoke, Hampshire, is a redundant Anglican church in the parish of Itchen Stoke and Ovington. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.
History.
St Mary is the third church to have been built in the village of Itchen Stoke. The first was built before 1270 on a site near the River Itchen, but it suffered from damp, became dilapidated and was pulled down around 1830. Some traces of it remain. The second church which replaced it was built on land in the centre of the village which was donated for the purpose by Lord Ashburton, who held the advowson. Charles Ranken Conybeare, son of the geologist William Daniel Conybeare, became the incumbent in April 1857, but he took a dislike to the church, complaining that it was cold and damp, and that remedying these defects would be more expensive than demolishing and replacing it. Consent for the demolition was given by the Bishop of Winchester and the new Lord Ashburton, and the present church was erected on the same site in 1866.
The architect of the new church was Charles Conybeare's younger brother Henry Conybeare, a civil engineer with an interest in Gothic architecture, who had designed the Afghan Church in Colaba, Mumbai, where he had also been responsible for improving the city's sanitation.
Architecture.
Sir Nikolaus Pevsner described St Mary as "serious and impressive" and "quite a remarkable church for its date". It is approached by a steep path up from the main road and the design was clearly influenced by the Sainte Chapelle in Paris.
Interior.
The west door opens into a wide vestibule in three compartments with a vaulted stone roof. It contains a stone font recovered from the previous church. Beyond it is the tall nave divided into bays by wall columns. It has a timber roof.
The chancel/apse is semi-octagonal with moulded ribs and wall columns. It has a vaulted stone roof. The five long arched windows of two lights with small rose windows contain little pieces of clear, red, blue and green glass arranged in geometrical patterns. The circular floor is covered with glazed brown and green tiles laid out in the form of a labyrinth, as in Chartres Cathedral.
The furnishings, contemporary with the church, include:

One Health

One Health has been defined as "the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines — working locally, nationally, and globally — to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment".
Background.
One Health is a new phrase, but the concept extends back to ancient times. The recognition that environmental factors can impact human health can be traced as far back as to the Greek physician Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) in his text "On Airs, Waters, and Places". He promoted the concept that public health depended on a clean environment.
The Italian physician Giovanni Maria Lancisi (1654–1720) was a pioneering epidemiologist, physician, and veterinarian, with a fascination in the role the physical environment played in the spread of disease in humans and animals. Lancisi may have been the first to advocate the use of mosquito nets for prevention of malaria in humans but was also a pioneer in the control of rinderpest in cattle. The idea that human, animal and environmental healths are linked was further revived during the French Revolution by Drs Louis-René Villerme (1782–1863) and (1790–1835) who developed the specialty of public hygiene.
In the late 19th century, German physician and pathologist Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902) coined the term "zoonosis", and said "...between animal and human medicine there are no dividing lines – nor should there be". Canadian physician Sir William Osler (1849–1919) traveled to Germany to study with Virchow. He returned to Canada and held joint faculty appointments at the McGill University Medical School and the Montreal Veterinary College. Osler was active as a clinical pathologist and internist at the Montreal General Hospital, but was also active in the promotion of veterinary health, and helped investigate a swine typhoid outbreak near Quebec City in 1878; he subsequently co-authored a monograph on parasites in Montreal's pork supply with A. W. Clement, a veterinary student at Montreal Veterinary College.
In 1947, James H. Steele, DVM (Doctor of veterinary medicine), furthered the concept in the U.S. by establishing the field of veterinary public health at the CDC. The phrase "One Medicine" was developed and promoted by Calvin W. Schwabe (1927–2006), a veterinary epidemiologist and parasitologist in his textbook "Veterinary Medicine and Human Health".
The more recent use of One Health may be traced to a story about Ebola hemorrhagic fever on April 7, 2003, when Rick Weiss of the Washington Post quoted William Karesh, DVM as saying, "Human or livestock or wildlife health can't be discussed in isolation anymore. There is just one health. And the solutions require everyone working together on all the different levels." The following year, Karesh and colleagues Robert Cook, VMD and Steve Osofsky, DVM launched a series of conferences around the world with the theme of One World - One Health (see section below).
Emerging infectious diseases.
Many emerging health issues are linked to increasing contact between humans and animals, intensification and integration of food production, and the expansion of international travel. As the number of new infectious diseases emerged in the 20th century, scientists began to recognize the challenges societies face regarding these threats that largely come from animals. Of the 1,415 microbes that are known to infect humans, 61 percent come from animals. For example, rodents transmit plague and typhus to humans, and domestic livestock are the original source of crowd diseases such as measles, mumps, and pertussis. One important exception is "Mycobacteria tuberculosis". Genetic evidence suggests that "Mycobacteria tuberculosis" originated in human populations and spread to animals. Chimpanzees were a reservoir host for the human immunodeficiency virus. Global trade of wildlife exacerbates the problem of disease emergence.
The 1999 West Nile virus outbreak in New York City highlighted the links between human and animal health. In this outbreak, wild crows began dying about a month or so before people began getting sick. The simultaneous outbreaks were not recognized as caused by the same entity until Dr. Tracey McNamara, an astute veterinarian at the Bronx Zoo, tied them together when her exotic birds began getting sick. After it was recognized that the outbreaks were caused by West Nile virus, a new entity in the Western Hemisphere, the CDC established the National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases, now the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.
In 2004, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) convened a group of health experts at Rockefeller University in New York and developed the phrase "One World - One Health" in order to promote the recognition of the impact of land use and wildlife health on human health. William B. Karesh, one of the leaders of the WCS effort, wrote articles in Foreign Affairs about the health links between humans, animals, and the environment.
The avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) epidemic that began in Hong Kong in 1997 forced the global community to recognize that animal health and human health are linked. The 1997 outbreak affected 18 people, killed 6, and provoked the culling of 1.5 million birds. The HPAI H5N1 virus resurfaced in isolated outbreaks between 1998–2003, but a widespread outbreak occurred in mid-2003 in South Korea. Delays in international reporting and weak response measures contributed to the spread of the virus across Southeast Asia. In recognition of the global threat that avian influenza (HPAI H5N1) and other emerging zoonotic diseases posed, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) developed a strategic framework, a tripartite agreement, to work more closely together to address the animal-human-ecosystem interface.
Comparative medicine.
Animals suffer from many of the same chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, asthma, and arthritis as humans. Sometimes a disease entity is recognized in animals long before it is recognized in humans. For example, fear-induced heart failure was described in wildlife about thirty years before it was recognized in humans. Comparative medicine is the study of disease processes across species and is based on the study of naturally occurring diseases of animals that also afflict humans. The concept of comparative medicine is very old. The ancient Greeks understood that dissecting and studying animals could yield important clues to understanding human diseases. From Galen to William Harvey, comparative anatomical and physiological studies have been responsible for significant advances in medicine; Frederick Banting and Charles Best discovered insulin through such work.
The musculoskeletal system is particularly well-suited to comparative medicine studies since acute and chronic disorders of bones and joints have the same counterparts in humans and animals. Information gained from one species can be directly translated to another, thereby advancing the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. Since the early 1930s, comparative orthopaedic research has incorporated the One Health concept. Otto Stader, a small animal veterinarian, used a comparative medicine approach and developed the first form of external skeletal fixation, the Stader splint, as a way to stabilize fractures in dogs. During World War II, Navy surgeons improved the treatment of fractures in sailors by incorporating Stader's advances. During the 1940s and 50's, Jacques Jenny, a veterinary surgeon, performed one of the first intra-medullary pinning procedures in animals and significantly advanced fracture repair strategies in horses and humans. In 1966, Sten-Erik Olsson VMD, MD and John L. Marshall DVM, MD, both of whom had medical and veterinary medical degrees, founded the first laboratory dedicated to comparative orthopaedic research at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. In the 21st century, comparative orthopaedic laboratories are located throughout the world and use both a comparative and translational research approach in an effort to improve diagnostic capabilities, enhance preventive and therapeutic strategies, and advance the understanding of disease mechanisms. Advances in fracture fixation, total joint replacement, and cartilage repair are a few examples of how knowledge flows in both directions, to benefit both human and animal health.
Environment.
Urbanization, globalization, climate shift, and terrorism have brought the need for a more diverse public health workforce to the forefront of public planning. Changes in land use, creation and operation of large terrestrial and marine food production units, and microbial and chemical pollution of land and water sources have created new threats to the health of both animals and humans. For example, deforestation for agriculture can lead to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Medical doctors are turning to environmental health scientists and practitioners to help them track disease outbreaks to the source, prevent chronic disease caused by chemical exposure, and create healthier living environments. Veterinarians are also turning to environmental health scientists and practitioners to prevent and control outbreaks and public health emergencies. One Health is the perfect unifying concept to bring together human health care practitioners, veterinarians, and public and environmental health professionals. By strengthening epidemiologic and laboratory investigations that assess the role of environmental influences, this partnership can help to develop and apply sustainable and effective community health interventions.
Commission.
The One Health Commission: in 2007, Dr. Roger Mahr, the President of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), met with Dr. Ronald Davis, the President of the American Medical Association, to discuss bringing the animal and human medical communities together. Dr. Davis suggested that the best way for the AMA to get involved in such an endeavor would be to pass a formal "One Health" resolution. In June 2007, the AMA unanimously adopted this resolution. The AVMA established a One Health Initiative Task Force and passed a One Health resolution analogous to the AMA's resolution in July 2008. The One Health Task Force eventually became the One Health Commission headed by Dr. Roger Mahr. It is headquartered at Iowa State University.
Initiative.
The One Health Initiative is separate from the One Health Commission. The One Health Initiative website has been serving as a global repository for all news and information pertaining to One Health. Organizations promoting this movement are listed on this website and include the American Medical Association, American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, The American Association of Public Health Physicians, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the U.S. National Environmental Health Association (NEHA). Additionally, more than 700 prominent scientists, physicians and veterinarians worldwide have endorsed the initiative. Additional history about the One Health Initiative is available at Horizon International, a non-profit organization based at Yale University, working to find and advance solutions to inter-related concerns of global health, the environment, and poverty.
International efforts.
The European Union has recognized the importance of One Health.
In the USA, the CDC has a One Health website with One Health resources. The 1st International One Health Congress met February 14–16, 2011 in Melbourne, Australia. The 2nd International One Health Congress met January 29-February 2, 2013 in Bangkok, Thailand.
The 1st One Health Conference in Africa was held July 14–15, 2011 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
The World Bank is investigating how to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of a One Health approach to global health. In June 2012, the World Bank published the economic benefits of One Health.
The importance of One Health is promoted by scientists in many countries and supported by prominent organizations including the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, World Organization for Animal Health, The International Federation for Animal Health, Global Alliance for Rabies Control, New Zealand Centre for Conservation Medicine (NZCCM), Hubnet in Asia the One Health Global Network, the University of California One Health Center, and the Infection Ecology and Epidemiology Network, Uppsala, Sweden.

Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves

Scarecrow and the Army of Thieves is an action/thriller released on 12 October 2011 by Australian author Matthew Reilly. It is the latest installment in the Shane Schofield series and has been described by the author as the fastest and most violent yet.
On 24 December 2010, Reilly announced his fifth Scarecrow novel stating: 
One month before the official release, Reilly's publisher released a video trailer for the book.
Plot summary.
During a routine re-staffing of Dragon Island, an old Soviet weapons installation in the Arctic, a Russian Spetsnaz team comes under fire from an unknown enemy. Vasily Ivanov, a researcher assigned to Dragon, manages to send out a distress signal which is intercepted by an American listening station in Alaska before his plane is shot down. Dragon Island was once the cornerstone of Soviet weapons research, a place where cutting-edge weapons were designed by scientists with a blank cheque. It has been seized by an organisation calling themselves "The Army of Thieves", led by the enigmatic Lord of Anarchy. Self-proclaimed anarchists, the Army is made up of enforcers of the Pinochet regime, Sudanese Janjaweed militants, Islamic fundamentalists and narco-terrorists. They are planning to unleash Dragon Island's centrepiece, known as the Tesla Weapon. Experiments with rocket fuel and samples of acids acquired from the atmosphere of Venus have created a compound that, when ignited, can set fire to the atmosphere. The Tesla Weapons was constructed on Dragon Island as prevailing air currents will disperse the acid-fuel mixture around the world. The Army of Thieves have taken control of the facility on Dragon Island and have activated the preliminary stages of the Tesla Weapon.
Still reeling from the events of "Scarecrow", United States Marine Corps Captain Shane Schofield has been reassigned to an equipment-testing project in the Arctic; this equipment includes BRT-E, or "Bertie", a multi-functional, independently-intelligent robot. Although cleared for active duty, Schofield is seen as a liability by the Corps, and has spent most of his time teaching new recruits. His situation is somewhat complicated by an outstanding bounty on his head; although members of the Majestic-12 conspiracy are dead, the French government has offered to pay the bounty as retaliation for the events of "Ice Station" and "Scarecrow". Schofield is one of just two units close to Dragon Island; the other is a Navy SEAL team stationed on the USS "Miami", a "Los Angeles"-class submarine. Ira Barker, the leader of this unit, warns Schofield to stay away from Dragon Island or else risk being caught in the crossfire. The SEAL insertion is a disaster, with every member of the team being killed off by the Army. With no other choice, Schofield makes for Dragon Island.
Schofield and his unit locate the remains of Ivanov's downed plane, and manage to rescue him while the Army attack. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of a French submarine; the French government has sent an assassin known as Renard after Schofield. Realising the threat posed by the Army, Schofield saves Renard two members of the French commando team sent after him, Dubois and Huguenot, also known as "The Barbarian", or "Baba" and described as Mother's equal. Successfully infiltrating Dragon Island, Renard reveals herself to be Veronique Champion, cousin to Luc Champion, a French researcher killed in "Ice Station". She agrees to help Schofield stop the Army, but pledges to kill him once the threat ends. They question Ivanov, who reveals that in order to fire the Tesla weapon, the Army needs to seed the atmosphere with the acid-rocket fuel mixture, before firing a battery of missiles armed with red uranium into the cloud. Schofield decides to target the red uranium and throw it into the Arctic Ocean.
As Schofield and his team begin to fight their way through the installation, David Fairfax - his friend in the Defence Intelligence Agency - begins to research the Army and Dragon Island. He grows suspicious that an irregular army such as the Army of Thieves would be able to carry out a string of attacks against high-value targets to arm themselves, and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds a CIA operative named Marius Calderon was writing about Dragon Island before the Soviet Union actually built anything there. He confirms that the Lord of Anarchy is actually Calderon, the CIA's foremost expert on psychological operations and gifted with extraordinary foresight; Calderon predicted the rise of China as an economic superpower by 2010 as early as 1982. Fairfax realises that Calderon let the Soviet Union discover the plans to the Tesla Weapon, and that the acid-rocket fuel mix will be distributed by the jetstream over China, India and Europe; once ignited, these regions will be decimated, but the United States will be relatively unaffected and able to preserve its position as the world's only economic superpower. Calderon succeeds in firing a missile armed with red uranium into the gas cloud, igniting it, but it is revealed that Ira Barker survived the SEAL team's assault and was able to shut down the gas diffusion process long enough to create a safe buffer, thereby limiting the ignition. However, Calderon still has several missiles at his disposal, and the larger gas cloud is well within their range.
Schofield destroys the red uranium primers one by one, but most of team is captured before he can destroy the last two. He and his team are tortured by Calderon - Mother and Baba have their heads locked in wooden boxes with hungry rats - before Schofield is electrocuted and his signature sunglasses claimed as a prize by Calderon. He is revived by Bertie and finds Mother and Baba survived by biting the heads off the rats locked in with them. They then give chase to Calderon before he can either launch the final missile, or detonate a warhead on board a cargo plane. Calderon escapes by ejecting a stolen mini-submersible from his plane, but Schofield ejects the last missile from the plane before it can ignite the gas cloud. The subsequent explosion disables Calderon's submarine; he is found two weeks later by a Norwegian fishing trawler, having suffocated at the bottom of the ocean.
With the threat posed by the Army finally over, the Russian government authorises a missile strike on Dragon Island. Schofield races back to the facility and gathers his unit in a nuclear bunker hidden under a laboratory. The missile destroys Dragon Island and kills the remnants of the Army. Schofield and his team are found alive and well several days later, having survived the blast. They are commended by the President for their actions, and the French government lift the bounty on Schofield's head for rescuing Veronique's team. Having finally come to terms with the death of Elizabeth Gant, Schofield starts a relationship with Veronique Champion - however, upon returning to the Marine barracks, he finds his sunglasses in his room, implying that Marius Calderon is alive.
Main Characters.
Shane "Scarecrow" Schofield.
A brilliant Marine Captain who is considered broken from the bounty hunt in the book Scarecrow after his girlfriend, Elizabeth "Fox" Gant, was killed. He is still recovering and has a USA $2,000,000 bounty on him from the French Government. He is working up in the North Pole with a DARPA team testing out new inventions along with his trusted friend Mother and two other Marines. He is constantly tormented by Marius Calderon over the death of Gant and a side story is him trying to cope with the loss.
Gena "Mother" Newman.
A friend of Schofield's who knows him better than most people as she has been with him since before the events in Ice Station. She tries to help Schofield get through Gant's death, which is also causing a strain in her marriage. Mother meets her perfect match and the two grow close.
David Fairfax.
A geeky cryptanalyst working with the DIA who helps Schofield by obtaining information to help with the mission. Schofield and Fairfax are good friends who Schofield stays in contact with for most of the book. Fairfax saves a woman from being kidnapped by several members of the Army of Thieves and they work on trying to find out why the Army of Thieves is on Dragon Island.
Veronique "Renard" Champion.
Champion, the cousin of Luc Champion who was killed during the events in Ice Station, is a French woman Schofield meets during a failed assassination attempt, is trying to avenge her cousin's, which she blames on Schofield. During the novel's events, Schofield and Champion grow close and by the end, it is possible they have started a relationship together. It is revealed that Renard is French for fox (Libby Gant, Schofield's girlfriend killed in Scarecrow, has the callsign "Fox").
Jean-Claude Francois Michel "Le Barbarian/Baba" Huguenot.
Mother's perfect match who is part of the French assassination attempt on Schofield due to the bounty on him. Mother and Baba share many similarities and they work closely together during the mission. Mother is offered the chance to be with Baba but in the end, she decides to stay with her husband.
Marius Calderon.
A CIA agent who theorised that China will become more powerful than the U.S. almost three decades before it did. He is the leader of the Army of Thieves who uses Psychological warfare against Schofield, going as far as to taunt Schofield over the loss of Gant. Calderon even makes Schofield watch as he presumably kills Mother and Baba for no reason than for him to just see it happen. Schofield was informed that Calderon died, which is later found to be false when he leaves Schofield's anti-flash glasses that he took earlier and left them on his bed.

Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company

Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power & Manufacturing Company of Niagara Falls, New York, was the first company to generate electricity from Niagara Falls in 1882. The company took over a canal used for hydraulic mill power which was built by predecessor companies. 
History.
In 1805 Augustus Porter along with his brother Peter Porter purchased the American Falls from New York at a public auction. The purchase also included the water rights from above the upper rapids till below the falls. Augustus proposed a hydraulic mill canal in 1847 and offered the right of way for the canal to any person ready to built it, but the Porter brothers died before somebody showed interest in the project.
Later Caleb Smith Woodhull with associates had the intention to built the canal. They purchased 1852 the land with the water rights from the heirs of the Porter brothers and formed 1853 the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Company. The company started with the construction of the canal in 1853 but stopped after 16 month because the construction costs of the canal had been underestimated and the company therefore failed. 
In 1856 Stephen N. Allen bought the company which became the Niagara Falls Water Power Company. It completed the entrance and river portion of the canal 1857. 
The company was purchased by Horace H. Day in 1860 and became the Niagara Falls Canal Company. The canal was finished 1861, but could not be used because of the Civil War. In 1875 the first customer, the grist mill of Charles B. Gaskill called the Cataract City Milling Company, was using the water of the canal. Before the water was dropping unused back to the Niagara River at the end of the canal. 1877 the company went again bankrupt and was auctioned. It was bought by Jakob Friedrich Schoellkopf, who formed 1878 the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company to use the canal. 
Built before the era of industrial production of alternating current, the electrical plant generated direct current electricity, and only provided it within a range of two miles from the plant.

Nelson H-44

The Nelson H-44 is an American single ignition, four-cylinder, horizontally opposed, direct drive, two-stroke aircraft engine that was developed by the Nelson Engine Company for use in motorgliders.
Design and development.
The H-44 was designed in the period following the Second World War and a specially designed motor glider was created by Hawley Bowlus to utilize the engine, the Bowlus/Nelson Dragonfly.
The engine was not certified. Under the CAR 5 regulations then in place in the USA for gliders, a certified "auxiliary power glider" could be flown with a non-certified engine and propeller. The engine is instead described on the Dragonfly type certificate.
The four-cylinder engine runs on a 12:1 mixture of 80 octane gasoline and SAE 30 oil. It is equipped with a single Carter WA1 carburetor and a recoil starter.
Operational history.
Employed in the Dragonfly the H-44 proved underpowered, which lead to the design of the H-49 version. The engine family was not a success and few were produced.

Vietnam Combat Artists Program

In June 1966, the Army Vietnam Combat Artists Program was established as part of the United States Army Art Program, utilizing teams of soldier-artists to make pictorial records of U.S. Army activities in the course of the Vietnam War for the annals of military history. The concept of the Vietnam Combat Art Program had its roots in WW II when the U.S. Congress authorized the Army to use soldier-artists to record military operations in 1944.
During the Vietnam Era, the U.S. Army Chief of Military History asked Marian McNaughton, then Curator for the Army Art Collection, to develop a plan for a Vietnam soldier art program. The result was the creation in 1966 of the U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Art Program under the direction of the Office of Chief of Military History and McNaughton's office. Her plan included involving the U.S. Army Arts and Crafts Program, then headed by Eugenia Nowlin. McNaughton's office relied on Nowlin and her cadre of local Army Arts and Crafts directors to solicit applications from soldiers, which were forwarded to McNaughton's office at the U.S. Army Center of Military History, where selection and team assignments were made. The U.S. Army provided logistics support as the teams of artists were sent to Vietnam and then to Hawaii.
Artists interested in joining the program were asked to submit applications through the Army Arts and Crafts Program facilities nearest their unit. Applications were to contain samples of drawings, photographs of paintings and a resume. Selections were made by a committee composed of designated representatives from the Office, Chief of Military History and the Adjutant General's Office. Supervised by Army Art Curator Marian McNaughton. The program was the joint responsibility of the Office, Chief of Military History, and the Adjutant General's Office with support from the Office, Chief of information.
History.
Nine Combat Artist Teams (CATs) operated in Vietnam. Typically, each team consisted of five soldier artists who spent 60 days of temporary duty (TDY) in Vietnam gathering information and making preliminary sketches of U.S. Army related activities. The teams then transferred to Hawaii for an additional 75 days to finish their work. Artists were given artistic freedom and encouraged to depict subjects in their own individual styles. Art created by soldier artists became a part of the U.S. Army Art Collection maintained by the U.S. Army Center of Military History (CMH), Washington, D.C.
On 17 March 1969, due to the widespread interest shown by soldier artists and the impact of their work throughout the Army, the official name was changed from the VIETNAM COMBAT ART PROGRAM to the ARMY ARTIST PROGRAM. Coverage was expanded to include portraying the U.S. Army worldwide.
U.S. Army soldier artist participants.
List of U.S. Army Vietnam Combat Artist Team (CAT) members and supervisors from 15 August 1966 – 14 January 1970. (Cities listed reflect information on original applications which are currently in archives of U.S. Army Center of Military History).
James Pollock, who in 1967 served as a soldier artist on U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Artist Team IV (CAT IV), chronicled his experience in an essay entitled "US Army Soldier-Artists in Vietnam" for "War, Literature & the Arts: An International Journal of the Humanities" published by the department of English and Fine Arts, United States Air Force Academy. In the essay Pollock wrote: "The idea of rotating teams of young soldier-artists from a variety of backgrounds and experiences through Vietnam was innovative. Soldier-artists were encouraged to freely express and interpret their individual experience in their own distinct styles. The artists responded enthusiastically to their artistic , and the resulting products were wide-ranging and comprehensive. Styles and media used were as diverse as the artists themselves, some chose detailed literal images while others preferred expressive almost abstract explosions striving to replicate the horrors of war".
Army artists after Vietnam.
During the Vietnam War the army art program also used civilian artists. While the last team of soldier artists in Vietnam was Soldier Art Team 9 (CAT IX) the Army's interest in using artists to depict army activities continued. The 1991 book "Portrait of an Army", published by U. S. Army Center of Military History and edited by General Gordon R. Sullivan and Marylou Gjernes, states "Following the Vietnam War, the Army continued to use both soldier and civilian artists. They have covered such peacetime activities as summer training for Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) West Point cadets, Army National Guard annual training, and tank gunnery training in Europe. The Army Art Collection has also acquired depictions of the Army's operations in Panama and Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM."
In 2003, former Vietnam soldier-artist James Pollock gave a presentation entitled "U. S. Army Vietnam Combat Art Program" about Vietnam Era soldier artists at Mary Pickford Theater, U. S. Library of Congress at which he said: "On January 14, 1970, the members of Vietnam Combat Art Team IX (CAT IX), the last U.S. Army art team to set foot in Vietnam, disbanded. Like members of eight other Army soldier-artist teams before them, they left their sketchbooks and paintings of war-torn Vietnam behind and quietly returned to their respective military units scattered throughout the world or were re-assigned. Talent and chance had brought 46 young soldiers together for a common purpose: To be artists day in and day out for 120 days and to translate their personal Vietnam experiences as soldiers into art. All of the artists were exposed to the inherent dangers of being in a war zone. While visiting units in the fields of Vietnam, they encountered difficult conditions and some had to deal with life-threatening incidents. None were wounded or killed. The post-Vietnam Era destiny of these soldier artists varied as they went on to establish and nurture families and careers. Some continued successfully as artists, some became art teachers, some laid down their paint brushes and found careers outside the field of art. Some have died, and the whereabouts of others is unknown".
Public showings.
From September 2010 to March 2011, the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, PA hosted an exhibit entitled "Art of the American Soldier" featuring more than 300 works from the army art collection, one of the first times that the Army Art from the Army Art Program has been put on display en masse.

<doc id="31155255" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31155255" title="Mx (title)">
Mx (title)

Mixter, usually written in its abbreviated form Mx., is an uncommonly used English honorific for genderqueer. It is a gender neutral title used by few people and its use has yet to be made official in general, although Brighton and Hove city council in Sussex, England, voted in 2013 to allow its use on council forms. (See also: Gender neutrality in English.)
Origin.
Nat Titman spoke about the origins of Mx. in question 23 of the Beyond the Binary interview series:
I liked Mx better when I first saw it being used around the turn of the millennium when it was described as a gender non-specific title that could be used for anyone, where the X was intended as a wildcard that could match any other title, much like the asterisk on "trans*". At that time it had the suggested pronunciation of "mux". It wasn't until 2002 that I saw people claiming that it's pronounced "mixture" but could be shortened to "mix" (with others on the mailing list expressing surprise and disagreement with this), and several years more until "mixter" was mentioned.
In practical terms, I've found that in many accents "mix" sounds too much like "miss" when pronounced and "mixture" is even more prone to sounding like "mister", so the original "mux" pronunciation may be more distinctive, although possibly less recognisable as a title (although it's not that far from the way Ms often ends up pronounced "mus" or "muz").
Usage.
In July 2011 a survey involving over 2,000 nonbinary respondents, Mx. was the most popular gender-inclusive title among them, and was second to Ms overall; when a title is mandatory, 37% of respondents used Mx., though the commentary points out that lots of people said they had answered according to titles that are often available on forms, and that titles such as Mx. and Per are rarely available on said forms.

The St. Francisville Experiment

The St. Francisville Experiment is a 2000 low-budget found footage horror film directed by Ted Nicolaou. The film was released direct to DVD on April 15, 2000 and centers upon a small group of paranormal investigators who spend a night in an old haunted mansion located in St. Francisville, Louisiana. The haunted mansion's back story was loosely based upon the true story of Delphine LaLaurie. 
Synopsis.
A group of paranormal investigators are given video cameras and the opportunity to spend the night in an abandoned house rumored to be haunted. The group finds several strange things, but initially their discoveries are easily explained away. However as the night progresses they become more and more unsettled and wonder if there is truly a supernatural force in the house.
Production.
Filming for "The St. Francisville Experiment" took place in Louisiana and California, and the filming was actually done in three houses. Author Troy Taylor helped put together the film's concept, which was initially supposed to be a documentary rather than a fictional film, a move that he stated was done mid-production. Taylor also stated that one of the houses wasn't abandoned and that a family was currently living in it. Upon its release the movie was promoted as a real encounter with the supernatural and the names of the film's actors were not disclosed.
Reception.
Critical reception for "The St. Francisville Experiment" was extremely negative. A reviewer for "JoBlo.com" criticized the film, noting that "there are many scenes where it’s impossible that the "actor" filmed himself from that angle", which made it "obvious that there’s a cameraman there with his own equipment". "Variety" gave a mixed review, remarking that it "is ultimately undone by its inability to reconcile its two contradictory impulses — to be the next “Blair Witch” while mocking the hand that feeds it."

Siegburg–Olpe railway

The Siegburg–Olpe railway or Agger Valley Railway ( or "Aggertalbahn") is a single-tracked, non-electrified branch line in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Part of a direct link from Cologne, only the section from Overath to Dieringhausen is still in operation. The section of line from Siegburg to Overath and from Dieringhausen to Olpe are closed.
The line is named after the River Agger, which it follows for a long way and crosses several times.
Significance.
Although the line as always been considered by its operator as a branch line, it is central to the railway network of the Oberbergisches Land and it has been called a “secret” main line. Like the other lines in the region it primarily served local industry (mainly the textile and metal industries). Unlike, for example, the Wiehl Valley Railway ("Wiehltalbahn"), the line was not primary built to serve the quarry industry, it also used to connect to company sidings and to other branch lines. Passenger played only a secondary role from the beginning.
Despite the fears of critics, the line was initially very profitable: the line from Siegburg to Derschlag was the most profitable branch line between Cologne and Kassel. This section was opened in 1896 while its continuation to Bergneustadt was still being planned. Accounts from 1892/1893 show that it had revenues of 21,000 marks per kilometre. For comparison, the Wisser Valley Railway ("Wissertalbahn") between Wissen and Morsbach generated only 6,800 marks per km. 
The following standard gauge branch lines branched from the Agger Valley Railway:
Up to the 1950s, there was also in Engelskirchen a loading bay of the metre-gauge Leppe Valley Railway ("Leppetalbahn") to Marienheide and a very small narrow-gauge railway to Drolshagen.
In addition, during the two world wars and the occupation of the Ruhr, the line together with the Wiehl Valley Railway was historically significant as a diversion route for coal trains and other important traffic. In the 1970s it was used as a scenic railway.
Until the 1970s there were many sidings serving industrial companies such as "Delta" in Derschlag and "Dörrenberg Edelstahl" in Ründeroth.
The traffic on the now closed Siegburg–Overath section usually had only local significance. Following the opening of the Cologne–Overath railway, trains ran from Cologne to Dieringhausen or even Hagen. The timetable only included a service over the whole of the original line from Siegburg to Olpe until the Second World War. 
There were also mostly only local passenger trains on the section between Dieringhausen and Olpe. There were few express trains in the timetable which ran to points outside the area. This was also one of the reasons for the closure of passenger services, partly caused by poor design, including the lack of a direct connection from Olpe to Gummersbach except via an awkward set of points in the Dieringhausen district.
History.
Planning and construction.
The first documented written discussions on a railway through the Oberbergische district date back to 1861. At that time, manufacturers founded a committee that planned a railway connection between Cologne and Kassel. This was originally intended to be a main line. This project did not materialise because the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company ("Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft") preferred a more northerly lines via Hagen and because of the problem of financing it—a main line would have cost 30 million gold marks. For comparison, the section from Bergneustadt to Olpe was priced at 3,367,000 marks in its building permit.
The planners of the Siegburg–Olpe railway preferred a direct connection to Cologne from the beginning rather than the indirect route via Siegburg. But at this time, there was still a military base in Cologne, which was in the way of the line. Another early plan proposed a line through the Agger valley from Siegburg to the Ruhr as part of the East Rhine Railway. This plan was rejected after the intervention of Cologne industrialists.
The Agger Valley Railway was the first major railway line inside the district of Oberbergischer Kreis. Before its construction, some critics claimed that its operations would not be profitable, so it was only agreed after long discussions and after the exertion of political pressure. The critics came mainly from the Cologne area because of its connection to Siegburg, as well as from the staff of the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company, which favoured a route to the north. The political pressure included the Prussian minister for railway at the time, Albert von Maybach, the most influential person in the region in relation to railway construction after Hermann von Budde. 
The first railway connections in the region occurred in Brügge (in the municipality of Lüdenscheid) in, 1874, in Olpe in 1875 and in Wipperfürth in 1877. The connections there were too far from the Oberbergischer Kreis for passengers and profitable freight operations.
For cost reasons, the railway was built as a branch line. In most places it was built right next to the road, straight through the villages. This would still be a problem at the beginning of the 20th century. Further evidence of cost savings are the stations of Ründeroth and Derschlag. Their entrance building were previously at Recklinghausen and Recklinghausen Süd. Since they were no longer large enough, they were dismantled and re-erected on the Agger Valley Railway. In the case of the Derschlag station another source gives a different origin for the entrance building. An 1885 plan of the station indicates it was moved from Horst station (now in Gelsenkirchen) to Derschlag.
Completion to the end of the First World War.
On 15 October 1884, the first train ran from Siegburg on the newly completed line to Ründeroth. It was initially frequented by only four pairs of trains. Protests led by local industrialists meant that the line was extended to Bergneustadt. The line came under direction of the railway division ("Eisenbahndirektion") at Frankfurt in 1895 but almost all of it (from the 0.7 kilometer point) was transferred to the railway division at Elberfeld in 1897.
In 1893, in the Volme Valley Railway was built branching from Dieringhausen to Gummersbach station at the same time the original "Niedersessmar" station was renamed "Gummersbach", where it is actually located. In 1897, the Wiehl Valley Railway, which branched from Osberghausen towards Waldbröl, was completed, which meant that Osberghausen station became a marshaling point.
Finally a line closing the gap to Olpe was approved in 1898. A height difference to the watershed to the Dörspe valley had to be overcome. The Wegeringhausen tunnel was also built nearby. The construction was problematic and its cost rose to nearly twice the estimate. It was completed on 11 February 1903. This newly built section of track was especially important for the villages between Bergneustadt and Olpe. These were previously connected by poorly maintained roads and trails and the area and had not even been connected by telegraph. Therefore, the population enthusiastically celebrated its completion for several hours, despite the long connecting times to Siegburg and Cologne. At the completion of the extension to Olpe, five pairs of passenger trains ran between Siegburg and Olpe and four more between Siegburg and Bergneustadt.
In 1910, the still operating section between Overath and Cologne was completed, ending through services between Siegburg and the Oberbergische district. This had a negative economic impact on Siegburg, because passengers now took the shorter, direct route to Cologne. The travel time from the Bergisches Land to Cologne was shortened to one and a half hours by the elimination of the detour via Siegburg and the old Siegburg–Overath route lost its importance.
Between 1910 and 1914, the line was relaid in many places on the hillside, as there had been many fatal traffic accidents and complaints of noise pollution in the area between Osberghausen and Derschlag. Between Niedersessmar and Derschlag the old track was used by passenger and freight trams operated at lower speed by the Gummersbach Light Railways ("Gummersbacher Kleinbahnen"). Between Vollmerhausen and Niedersessmar the old track was completely removed.
In 1913, a line was proposed to Eckenhagen. This 6.9 km long line was approved on March 1914, but the outbreak of the First World War, prevented its construction. Similarly, it was proposed in the 1920s to extend the Gummersbach Light Railways to Eckenhagen.
Weimar Republic to the end of the Second World War.
The high reparations required by the Versailles Treaty led to a shortage of rolling stock and a limited timetable. But the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, when the French occupied the Ruhr region, meant that it became an important route for diverted coal trains. Thus the Agger Valley Railway towards Olpe along with the Wiehl Valley Railway and the Wisser Valley Railway ("Wissertalbahn") and its connection to the Volme Valley Railway was one of the main lines in the new Weimar Republic for a few months. Due to the large amounts of heavy trains that ran on the line to the east, the cheaply built superstructure was damaged. The repairing of this damage took some time.
In 1927, a direct service to Cologne was opened. In this case, however, the Volme Valley Railway connection to the north was preferred to running to Olpe. Express trains to the north in 1931 included a connection from Wuppertal over the Wipper Valley Railway ("Wippertalbahn"), the Volme Valley Railway and the Agger Valley Railway to Olpe.
During the construction of Agger Valley Dam ("Aggertalsperre") there was a high volume of commuters by immigrant workers to Derschlag, changing to the Gummersbach Light Railways to continue through Dümmlinghausen to Genkelmündung. A specially decorated pair of trains was operated for the transport of these workers to Derschlag, running from Cologne to Derschlag on Mondays and returning on Saturdays.
During World War II, mobile guns were installed on the line in Hützemert because the east-west link again played an important role as a diversion route. From 1943, the Oberbergische district was repeatedly bombed by the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. Because of the stationed guns, the station and the railway depot in Dieringhausen were hit by a total of fifteen massive air raids by the end of the war. Among other things, the western half of the large entrance building and the eastern half of the roundhouse and turntable were destroyed. Part of the roundhouse was never rebuilt. The diversion route stopped because of destruction to the west by German troops under Hitler’s scorched earth policy. Among other things, the Hoffnungsthal tunnel was destroyed by German troops. All trains had to operate via Siegburg.
After the Second World War.
The reopening of the Hoffnungsthal tunnel on 14 May 1949 led to the abandonment of some rail services between Siegburg and Overath, there were now only local services. From 1949, all passenger services ran to Cologne. The Deutsche Bundesbahn railway division ("Bundesbahndirektion") at Wuppertal informed locals from 1950 of the proposed closure of the western section, which took place after the thinning of services in 1954. Passenger services ended in 1956 due to roadworks.
Between Siegburg and Overath the steam train service was affectionately known as the "Luhmer Grietche". At the beginning of the 1950s, the era of steam trains ended on the line. The steam trains were replaced by Uerdinger railbuses. However, it was reported that railbuses were often overcrowded especially for the carriage of school children in Bergneustadt. In addition, changes were required from Olpe–Dieringhausen services to services to Cologne. The transfer times in Dieringhausen were getting longer and meant that many passengers preferred buses. Deutsche Bundesbahn itself increasingly operated its own buses ("Bahnbus"), competing with its own rail services. There was an upsurge in passenger during the construction of the Bigge Valley Railway and the subsequent excursion trains and other tourist trains operated.
Hopes for a resumption of passenger service between Siegburg and Overath were dashed in 1959 with the issue a license to close the line. In 1960, closure procedures commenced for the transport of freight between Lohmar and Overath, which were completed in 1962. The line between Lohmar and Overath was dismantled in the same year. The remaining part of the line between Siegburg and Lohmar was transferred to the jurisdiction of the railway division at Cologne.
The last regular passenger service operated between Olpe and Dieringhausen on 28 December 1979 despite protests from the public and local politicians.
Deutsche Bundesbahn closed freight operations between Bergneustadt and Wiedenest in 1985. An embankment collapsed due to poor construction near Wiedenest on 27 May 1989 and freight operations from Bergneustadt to Drolshagen were abandoned and the section was closed.
In 1993, the penultimate special passenger excursion train derailed in Derschlag. The damaged track was blocked and was beyond repair. The last passenger excursion train ran on 27 August 1993.
Freight traffic closed between Drolshagen and Eichen in 1991 and between Eichen and Olpe in 1993. On 13 May 1994, a class 290 diesel locomotive hauled the last freight wagon from Bergneustadt to Dieringhausen. Freight trains ran only between Dieringhausen and Niedersessmar until 1997, when the remaining track was closed.

The National Heritage Acts comprise four Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that aimed to alter the way in which Britain's national heritage assets are managed and protected.
National Heritage Act 1980.
The National Heritage Act 1980 established the National Heritage Memorial Fund, abolished the National Land Fund, made provision for property to be accepted in satisfaction of taxation and provided for indemnities for objects on loan from museums and libraries. One of the primary drivers for the Act was the public controversy relating to the refusal of the Callaghan Government to accept an offer of Mentmore Towers and its contents in lieu of inheritance tax.
National Heritage Act 1983.
The 1983 act established the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the Armouries, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew as non-departmental public bodies to be governed by boards of trustees.
Section 30 of act made provision for the designation and funding of the Armed Forces Museums. 
Prior to 1982, other British ancient or historical monuments and buildings had been protected through the Department of the Environment. This was felt by the ruling Conservative government to be lacking in public respect and to be excessively expensive. The 1983 Act created the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission (HBMC), another non-departmental public body, to be given the a broad remit of managing the historic built environment of England. After the passing of the act, the HBMC was given the shorter working name of English Heritage, by which it is commonly known today.
National Heritage Act 1997.
The 1997 Act amended the 1980 Act by extending the scope of the National Heritage Memorial Fund to include things of any kind which are of scenic, historic, archaeological, aesthetic, architectural, engineering, artistic or scientific interest, including animals and plants which are of zoological or botanical interest.
It also modified the 1983 Act, inserting section 31A to make specific provision for preservation of the Royal Naval College site.
National Heritage Act 2002.
The 2002 Act extended the powers of the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission to encompass underwater archaeology within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom.

Niche Retail

Niche Retail is an eCommerce company based in Sylvan Lake, Michigan. Since its inception in 2001, Niche Retail has been specializing in Direct-to-consumer and Business-to-business online sales channels. Niche Retail's tagline is "Everything but the brand".
History.
Niche Retail was founded in 2001 by Brad Sorock and Tyler Smith as a direct-to-consumer e-tailer of niche products. It was easier to compete with Amazon.com than to become them, which spawned the idea to build niche websites. In 2001 Sorock and Smith bought the unused domain name of NicheRetail.com from Network Solutions, and launched SuuntoWatches.com shortly thereafter. After its first year, Niche Retail moved from Crested Butte, Colorado to Birmingham, Michigan and added three additional online stores. After launching five more online stores in 2003, Niche Retail moved to its current location in Sylvan Lake, Michigan in 2004. Niche Retail, a consistent top 500 e-tailer according to "Internet Retailer" magazine, operates more than 20 online stores, selling niche products such as strollers, watches, recliners, weather meters and other niche category websites.
The company filed bankruptcy in the summer of 2011 and is no longer in business. Ironically, their remaining online retail websites, such as joggingstroller.com, are now actually Amazon affiliate sites, apparently showing that it is indeed easier to become Amazon than to compete with them.

Nuclear power in Thailand

Thailand has no nuclear power stations, but the Thai Energy Ministry periodically considers plans for the nuclear power option.
Power Demand.
Pricha Karasuddhi, technical adviser for the Nuclear Power Programme Development Office stated that power demand will double in the next 12 years. According to him, if the government goes for nuclear power, it must make a decision to do so now to pave the way for preparation. It is crucial to put this on the national agenda, again, according to him, to draw participation from all parties involved and debate the merits of Thai nuclear energy. According to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, daily demand for electricity hit 10 new peaks last year. The latest was registered on May 10, 2010 at 24,009MW, higher than the record of 22,044MW on April 24, 2009 - due to higher temperatures and economic recovery. EGAT is worried about power blackouts or brownouts in the next 10 years when demand rises against a limited increase in new supply.
Nuclear power is expected to reduce Thailand's natural gas consumption in power generation from 70 per cent to 40 per cent.
Figures from 2007 reveal that Thailand used natural gas to generate electricity more than any energy source at 66.2%, followed by lignite at 12.6%. Hydro power accounted for 5.5%, bunker oil 2.7%, diesel 0.03% and renewable energy 1.6%. Imported coal accounted for 8.4%, while purchased electricity from Laos and Malaysia was at 3%.
Others suggest that power demand can adequately be supplied by cheaper and safer eco-energies.
Fukushima 1 response.
Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, on March 14, 2011, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva ordered the Energy Ministry to review its plan to establish five nuclear power plants. The ministry has been instructed to study two issues in detail:
Concern is mounting given the problems in Japan, if Thailand is to adopt the Japanese model.
As of 2012, the Thai Energy Ministry is drafting a plan that could see a nuclear facility go into operation in 2026.
Protests.
On November 3, 2009 anti-nuclear plant protesters in the Tha Chana District of Surat Thani province have dispersed but demanded the electricity authority carry out a public hearing before proceeding with the construction plan. More than 500 protesters trespassed into a meeting room of the Tha Chana district office in Surat Thani province while representatives from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand or EGAT were giving a presentation about a site survey for a nuclear power plant in the area.
On March 15, 2011 about 2,000 people from 18 districts of Kalasin Province rallied outside the city hall to protest against the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand's (EGAT) plan to build a nuclear plant in their province. Banners were raised to denounce some MPs in the province for having asked EGAT to build a nuclear plant in the province and claiming that it was the wish of the people. Well MPs claimed the people agreed to having the nuclear plant at public hearings which in fact had never been held, they said. The protesters said groundwork for the construction of a nuclear plant had been underway near Non Somboon village in tambon Hua Hin of Kalasin's Huay Mek district. The construction site is less than 10km from the Lam Pao river, the lifeline of Kalasin.
On March 26, 2011 Abac poll at the Assumption University reported that more than 80% of the respondents (83.4%) disagreed with the plan to construct nuclear power plants in Thailand. The poll involved 3,807 peopled aged 18 up in 17 provinces, was conducted from March 1 to 25, 2011. Bangkok residents had the largest percentage of the objection of 95.2 per cent followed by those in southern region (91.5%), the central (91.1%), the North (90.0%) and the Northeast (85.8%). It should be marked that this poll was conducted during the Fukushima I nuclear accidents in Japan.

Muthalali

Muthalali is a 1965 Malayalam language film directed by M. A. V. Rajendran. It stars Prem Nazir, Adoor Bhasi, T. S. Muthaiah and Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair. Muthalali is inspired by the Tamil language film of the same name.
The Tamil film Muthalali (1957), produced by M. A. Venu and directed by ‘Muktha’ Sreenivasan made on a small budget, was a huge hit. The film won the National Award for the best Feature Film in the regional language category. It was the screen version of a popular play by the same name written by A. K. Venkataramanujam.
The unprecedented success of the film was attributed to its good script combined with strong mass elements like songs and performances.
The producers remade the film in Malayalam with the same title. It was released on April 30, 1965. Directed by M. A. V. Rajendran, the film was shot at Rathna Studios, Salem.
Dance sequences choreographed by ‘Chinni’ Sampath were an attraction of the film. Music director K. V. Mahadevan who composed the music for the original recommended his assistant T. K. Pukazhenthi’s name to compose for the remake. Playback singer B. Vasantha made her debut in Malayalam films through this film.
Plot.
Venu (Prem Nazir) who owns a glass factory in Ernakulam goes to America for higher studies. During Venu’s absence his mother, Saraswathi Amma (Aranmula Ponnamma), manages the factory with the help of the manager Vikraman Nair (Muthiah). Gradually Vikraman brings everything under his control and swindles the company taking advantage of Saraswathi Amma’s trust in him.
After a few years Venu returns after his studies. He lands in Bombay en route to Ernakulam where he meets Kesavan (Pappukutty Bhagavathar), a hotel employee. Through Kesavan he comprehends the hardships faced by labourers and the need to understand the life is for a worker before becoming the owner of a factory. Venu sends telegram to his mother informing her that he has to go on a business tour and will reach home a month later.
Venu reaches Ernakulam, in disguise as Velu, and gets himself a job in his own factory with the help of Devaki (Sheela), a worker in the factory. Venu befriends her father, Raman Nair (Thikkurissi), and stays in their home.
Venu gets a clear picture of what Vikraman Nair is up to and how he manipulates the factory’s assets. Vikraman, in the meanwhile, is in love with Malathi (Junior Padmini) who Venu was supposed to marry. Venu falls in love with Devaki.
Within few days Venu gets a clear picture of the crisis the factory is passing through. Vikraman’s wicked eye falls on Devaki.
Venu decides it is time to return as himself. He leaves after writing a letter to Devaki saying that he will come back soon. Devaki becomes suspicious of Venu’s motives. Devaki is dismissed from her job in the factory.
She leaves the city in search of Venu and reaches Thiruvananthapuram. There she meets her brother Kesavan, the hotel worker who Venu met in Bombay.
Venu comes back and takes charge of the factory. He is disappointed when he comes to know that Devaki has been dismissed and that she has left the home.
He meets the workers in his factory, tells them that he is aware of what the manager has been up to and assures them that there will be a change in how the factory is run.
Unable to come to terms with being shown his place in the factory, Vikraman spreads a rumour that Venu is an impostor Velu. And now for the climax.
Venu, in the meanwhile, sets out in search of Devaki and brings her back. He is arrested on charges of impersonation on a complaint by Vikraman. All misunderstandings are cleared. Venu reveals the purpose behind coming back under disguise and exposes Vikraman Nair.
The police arrests Vikraman for swindling the factory. Venu marries Devaki. The workers of the factory are now under a ‘Muthalali’ (owner), who understands the hardships they face and acknowledges their rights. A happy ending to the film.

HP Universal Print Driver

HP Universal Print Driver (UPD) is an intelligent print driver that supports a broad range of HP LaserJet printers and MFPs. Developed by Hewlett-Packard, it combines a general purpose driver (UNIDRV or PSCRIPT) and HP proprietary extensions. HP UPD simplifies driver deployment and management. This advanced print driver has the ability to discover HP printing devices and automatically configure itself to the device capabilities (e.g., duplex, color, finishing, etc.).
HP Universal Print Driver is a Microsoft Windows solution that provides two modes of operation, traditional and dynamic. In traditional mode, the HP UPD behaves similarly to traditional print drivers. In dynamic mode, it provides discovery, auto configuration, and management features that are particularly well suited for mobile computer users.
Operating modes.
HP’s Universal Print Driver is based on Microsoft’s universal core drivers UNIDRV and PSCRIPT. These core drivers are not usable until device specific information is used to inform the core driver of the actual device settings and capabilities. To accomplish this task, a universal printing dialog box is inserted before the standard print setup dialog box. The universal printing dialog box allows users to choose a recently used device, enter a device IP address, search for local print devices, or choose a device from a predefined list.
Regardless of the device discovery method used, the Microsoft core driver is updated accordingly and the new device information is then reflected in the normal print driver user interface.
HP provides three different Universal Print Drivers: PCL5, PCL6 and emulation PostScript. Custom default values can be assigned with the HP Driver Configuration Utility.
Dynamic mode.
In dynamic mode, searching for devices is accomplished using the mDNS discovery protocol (aka Bonjour). The mDNS protocol performs satisfactorily for devices residing on the same subnet only. Users will need to enter IP addresses for remote devices unless they have been previously discovered or are available on a managed printers list. Whether discovered, entered, or chosen, the HP universal printing dialog box submits SNMP requests to the target device’s IP address.
Using enterprise auto configuration (EAC) and a bidirectional communications port, SNMP requests ascertain a device’s configurations and capabilities. The results are used by HP UPD to update the print driver table in the Windows registry to accurately reflect the target device’s capabilities. The results are also cached (CREG) and the recently discovered device list is updated to provide an easy method for future selection. In dynamic mode, HP UPD is considered to be a virtual device. Therefore, the new device instances do not appear in the Printers folder.
Traditional mode.
In traditional mode HP UPD is bound to a print queue and behaves like a normal printer driver with the addition of bi-directional communications for device queries and real time print job status. This mode can be chosen during driver installation, or on the dynamic mode universal printing dialog box. The traditional mode bypasses the universal printing dialog box and goes directly into the typical print setup dialog box.
Automatic configuration does not occur in traditional mode; but, users can select manual updates to ensure the device’s capabilities are properly represented. The HP UPD can be installed either in dynamic mode, traditional mode, or both, depending on user requirements.
Management features.
HP UPD includes driver management features allowing IT administrators to pre-configure, deploy, and manage the HP driver software. Management tools within the HP UPD include INSTALL.EXE with command line options, the HP MPA Tool, Active Directory Templates, Driver Configuration Utility, Driver Deployment Utility and HP Web Jetadmin.
"INSTALL.EXE"
HP UPD installer allows some driver default settings to be modified via command line options. Some of these switches will change the system-wide behavior of the HP UPD, while other changes are specific to a single print queue.
"HP MPA Utility"
The HP MPA utility pre-configures some driver default settings in a managed HP UPD environment. Settings made within the HP MPA utility control the HP UPD at a user level. The resulting policies are maintained for every printer attached to the HP UPD. They are global user policies that affect HP UPD users.
"HP UPD Active Directory Templates"
An HP UPD Administrative Template(an Active Directory Template) can be added to create a Group Policy Object to manage the user UPD capabilities. The settings apply to any queue that uses the HP UPD. Care should be taken when locking configuration settings as the user is unable to change a locked setting.
"HP Driver Configuration Utility"
The HP Driver Configuration Utility (DCU) is a Windows application used to edit the configuration file associated with a particular driver. The configuration file controls the print driver settings and takes effect when the driver is installed.
"HP Driver Deployment Utility"
DDU is used to pre-configure a print driver for deployment. When the package is run on the client computer, the new configuration file configures the printer driver after it is installed, and does not interfere with WHQL certification. DDU contains the standalone DCU utility inside the package and is launched when Pre-configure driver is selected from the DDU tool.
Beyond driver configuration, HP UPD also employs managed printer lists (MPLs) and managed print policies (MPP) to control access to devices and capabilities. These technologies are used with HP UPD in dynamic mode. If MPLs are used, then searching for devices is unnecessary. Users are presented with a predefined list of devices from which to choose. MPLs are XML files that can be created manually, with the HP MPA utility, or exported from HP Web Jetadmin. When the HP UPD is activated, it begins by searching the network for the MPL file as shown in Figure 6. MPPs are used to control which users have access to device features like color, duplex, etc. By default, HP UPD assumes that the HP MPA is installed on a server named managed-print. As a result, HP UPD searches the network for this server to find HP Managed Print Policies or HP Managed Printer Lists.
Status Notification Popups (SNPs).
The driver also includes status notification pop-ups during print submission that inform the user on device status, print job status, and consumable levels. This is a graphical popup window that displays a dashboard of toner supply levels, links for reordering consumables, and an instant support landing page for that particular HP device model. When the HP UPD is selected for printing, it will attempt to communicate directly with the printer to gather status and job information during printing. By querying the printer through SNMP get commands, network traffic is kept to a minimum and is only present during printing. If desired, the SNPs can be disabled.
Revision history.
HP UPD is available as a Microsoft Windows 32-bit or 64-bit driver and automatically configures itself to the local language of the host system. Currently, 35 different spoken languages are supported. Over the years, many new features have been added to the HP Universal Print Driver solution. Below is a list of revisions and associated features of the HP UPD software.

To Say I Love You

To Say I Love You is the second episode of "Cracker". It is the first episode of the series divided into three parts, and is notable for featuring the first death of a major character, in this case, DC George Giggs.
Plot.
Part One.
A young woman called Tina Brien goes into a pub and is lovestruck by the singing of a performer, Sean Kerrigan. She befriends Sean, learning that he has a stutter (and can thus only speak when singing or angry) and is homeless and poor. Tina invites Sean to live with her in her rather run down flat, and the same night, they make love. Meanwhile, Fitz waits to meet with Judith in a restaurant, hoping to reconcile with her, but she turns up with her therapist, Graham, much to Fitz's chagrin. Judith agrees to return home if Fitz joins Gambler's Anonymous, but Fitz refuses, showing Judith that most of the expensive clothes she has were bought by Fitz with his gambling money, a fact which Judith hates.
While Sean is taking a shower, Tina is paid a rude visit by a loan shark, Kevin Cormack, to whom she owes money and who takes her television and Sean's singing trophies. Tina goes to her family to ask them to lend her some money to pay Cormack and get Sean's cups back, but they refuse, instead telling her to dump Sean and return home first. Distraught, Sean hijacks a bus and speeds through Manchester until he is pulled over and arrested by the police. At the same time, Fitz is arrested for harassing Judith and her parents.
At the station, DS Jimmy Beck winds Sean up to the point that Sean begins throwing fits of rage. Reluctantly, he calls Fitz to calm Sean down, which he succeeds in doing. Sean requests that they contact Tina to tell her where he is. Fitz realises that Sean has a mental instability, and implores Beck to release Sean into his custody for psychiatric reports, but Beck refuses, instead sending Sean to court. Sean is placed on probation for two years and instructed to report to the station every two days. Still enraged at the loss of his trophies, Sean conspires with Tina to kill Cormack. That night, Tina lures Cormack up an alleyway with a promise of sex, but as they are making love, Sean kills Cormack by smashing his skull with a brick. The murder arouses Tina and she and Sean have sex before fleeing back to their flat.
Cormack's body is found the next morning and the police are summoned. DCI Bilborough hires Fitz again to look at the crime scene, and within a few minutes, Fitz accurately deduces how the murder was committed, noticing Sean's trouser button on the ground and strands of Tina's hair on the wall. Bilborough is skeptical, but Fitz makes a bet with him. Bilborough asks DC Giggs to hold the money. To Bilborough's chagrin, Fitz goes on a talk show that night and gives a profile of the two killers. Sean and Tina see this on a television at a bowling centre, and Sean panics, convinced that Fitz knows about what he has done.
The police begin questioning those who owed Cormack money. Giggs pays Tina a visit and speaks with her. Convinced that the police are closing in on them, Tina invites Giggs to the flat that night for sex, and secretly tells Sean (who was hiding) that they have to kill Giggs in order to stay together.
Part Two.
Fitz decides to attend one of Graham's Gambler's Anonymous meetings, only to upstage Graham by getting all the others to start gambling with him. Later, in a private talk, Fitz subtly warns Graham not to try anything with him. Fitz relationship with Mark is not going well either, and they get into another argument when Fitz notices small holes in Mark's shirt from when Mark was smoking. 
Giggs returns to Tina's flat and engages in foreplay with Tina, but as soon as he notices the flat covered in bin liners, he is brutally beaten to death by Sean and his body is dumped on the river side along with a video of a disguised Sean and Tina telling the police of their plan to kill Giggs so that they can stay together. Fitz tries to get Judith to return home for their children's sake, but she tells him she is going to dinner with Graham, and has been going out with him for a while now. In retaliation, Fitz takes DS Penhaligon out to dinner at the same time and restaurant. Embarrassed and hurt at being used, Penhaligon pours a jug of cold water on Fitz and walks out. Fitz goes back to Penhaligon's apartment and apologises to her, but turns down her offer to stay the night.
Giggs's body is discovered and Bilborough calls Fitz and Penhaligon to the scene. Penhaligon falls into a depression, having been severely hurt by the loss of her father many years ago. While going through Giggs's things, Fitz and Bilborough find a packet of condoms inside Giggs's jacket pocket. They ask Penhaligon if it is possible that Giggs could have been cheating on his wife, and she agrees, but adds that Giggs had had a vasectomy years ago, and was likely hoping to avoid catching anything from his killer using the condoms. The video comes back from forensics and is played for the police. Fitz immediately recognises Sean and the police raid Sean and Tina's flat, but they are gone. Fuming, Fitz tells Bilborough that they had Sean in custody but Beck released him. Bilborough angrily confronts Beck and Penhaligon about this, but they deny it, as Fitz has no proof.
That night, Fitz is alone at a pub when he is approached by Tina, going by the name "Michelle". Sean and Tina have made a plan to kill Fitz, but Fitz sees through Tina's ruse and discreetly calls the police, who arrive and arrest Tina as Sean speeds away.
Part Three.
Bilborough and Penhaligon interrogate Tina about Sean's whereabouts, but Tina refuses to tell them anything. Sean, meanwhile, goes to a petrol station and severely assaults the shopkeeper, stealing several tanks of fuel.
Fitz is called in to question Tina, but she still refuses to talk, comparing her relationship with Sean to that of Bonnie and Clyde. Sean calls Fitz at home, but is unable to speak to him. Just then, Mark suffers an attack from appendicitis and Fitz rushes him to the hospital. Fitz and Judith briefly reconcile over their son's predicament, but Fitz is hurt when Judith reveals that she has slept with Graham but now regrets it.
Fitz and Penhaligon visit Tina's family to gain information on her background. At the station, Fitz speaks to Tina about how her life was much better a few years before but she slowly started failing at school and eventually left home. Tina finally reveals the reason for her resentment towards her family: as she had been growing older, she began to realise that the primary reason for her birth was to serve as a guide dog for her blind sister, Sammy, who absorbed all the family attention when they were children. Tina eventually grew to hate Sammy for this (as Sammy did Tina despite everything Tina did for her), and left her neglectful parents (and further reinforcing Tina's belief is that her parents bought a Labrador to replace her after she left). Indeed, when Tina's parents come to visit, all she does is growl mockingly in their faces. But Fitz finally manages to win over Tina by promising her one final private hour with Sean before they go to prison if she turns him over. Tina reveals that Sean will most likely go after Sammy in an act of revenge for being the primary cause of Tina's misery. Bilborough has Tina's parents call Sammy to warn her, but just before she can answer the phone, Sean arrives and easily subdues Sammy, dousing her, himself and the entire house with fuel and turning the gas taps on.
Fitz and the police rush to Sammy's home and Bilborough calls Sean. Despite his stutter, Sean manages to demand that Fitz come inside alone. Fitz does so and Sean attempts to tell him that he was behind everything and forced Tina into aiding him. Fitz bluffs by backing this up, telling Sean that Tina had sex with Giggs when Sean wasn't there and willingly told them where Sean would be in exchange for her own freedom. Irate, Sean threatens to light a match and blow the house up with the three of them still inside, but the fire brigade informs Bilborough that Tina's house has central heating which will come on at six o'clock, in exactly three minutes, and blow the house up anyway. With Sean no longer in control, Fitz manages to get Sammy out of the house and away from harm. Once alone with Sean, Fitz tells him that Tina only gave him up because she was promised an hour with him, and implores him to leave the house with him. Sean, however, suffers a mental breakdown and begins singing crazily, forcing Fitz to leave Sean behind.
As the house explodes, Fitz falls over, apparently impaled by flying glass. A clearly worried Penhaligon rushes to his side and cries briefly while believing him to be dead, but Fitz wakes up satisfied, now knowing of Penhaligon's feelings for him. Penhaligon cries with relief in Fitz's arms.

Kavyamela

Kavyamela is a 1965 Malayalam film written by S. L. Puram Sadanandan and directed by M. Krishnan Nair, starring Prem Nazir and Sheela in the lead roles. The film is best known for the performance by Prem Nazir and songs by Dakshinamoorthy - Vayalar team.
"Kavyamela" released on 22 October 1965. It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam.
Plot.
Jayadevan (Prem Nazir), the blind poet, has a burning passion to earn literary fame, but fate conspires to deny it to him for long. And when it comes, he disdains it.
Spurned by his sister and duped by the crook Vikraman (Adoor Bhasi), Jayadevan wanders from place to place and comes across a girl Sreedevi (Sheela), who, after initial suspicions, nurses him back to vision and falls in love with him. But ill-luck chases him even to prison.
Meanwhile, Vikram gets hold of Jayadevan's monumental work, the manuscript of his collection of poems, and publishes it in his own name which gains instant recognition. While Vikram is about to be honoured for this, Jayadevan succeeds in unfolding the truth. Yet in this moment of truimph and glory, he declines both the public encomium and the hand of Sridevi.
Production.
The film was shot at Newton and Shyamala Studios. The film's storyline is similar to Guru Dutt's "Pyaasa" (1957, Hindi). However, the film is an official remake of a Kannada film by Velan. T. E. Vasudevan bought the rights of the film from Velan with a shoestring amount of 1000. Owing to the commercial success of Malayalam version, Velan wanted to remake the film into Tamil. He bought back the rights for 5000, and made the Tamil film "Devi" (1968), which however failed in the box office.

Panicos O. Demetriades

Panicos Onisiphorou Demetriades (; born 19 January 1959) is a Cypriot :economist, who is a European Central Bank Governing Council member and the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus from 3 May 2012. Prior to his appointment, he was a Professor of Financial Economics at the :University of Leicester.
Biography.
Panicos was born in :Limassol, :Cyprus. From 1978 to 1981, he studied economics at the :University of Essex where he graduated with first-class honours. He continued his studies at Essex where in 1983 he completed his MA in economics, graduating with distinction. Between 1983 and 1987 he studied for a PhD at :Cambridge University under the supervision of Frank Hahn and Hashem Pesaran. The title of his thesis was "Essays on the Costs of Inflation". During his studies at Cambridge Demetriades won the Stephenson Prize in Economics, awarded in recognition of his work on the relationship between the level and variability of inflation.
Career.
After obtaining his PhD he worked for 5 years in the Economic Research Department at the :Central Bank of Cyprus. In 1990 he left the Central Bank and joined the Department of Economics at :Keele University where in 1996 he became Reader in Economics. In 1997 he left Keele and joined South Bank University as Professor of Financial Economics and remained there for 3 years. Since 2000 he has been Professor of Financial Economics at the :University of Leicester.
He has been appointed to the position of governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus effective from 3 May 2012.
Academic research.
Demetriades’s academic work focuses on the relationship between finance and growth as well as the interactions between public and private capital and productivity. His early work on finance and growth challenged the view that growth in the financial system is, by itself, sufficient to deliver more economic growth and emphasised the importance of good institutions. Moreover, he has shown that, where present, the contribution of the banking sector to growth is more significant than that of equity finance through the stock market. More recent work has challenged widely held views about government owned banks by showing that, far from acting as an obstacle to growth, such banks can actually enhance both financial and economic development. His work on public capital contradicts the ‘crowding out’ argument often used by mainstream economists to justify cuts in public spending and reduce the size of government. Specifically, he shows that public investment can actually promote the productivity of the private sector and stimulate trade, employment and long run growth. In this sense, his work has a distinctly Keynesian flavour, influenced by new Keynesians such as Joseph Stiglitz. Although his work can be classified as macroeconomics, he also utilises both micro-data and micro-econometrics. His academic work has been influential, as evidenced by over 2,500 citations in Google Scholar. According to the RePEc rankings, he is in the top 2% of the world’s most widely read economists.
Apart from his academic work, Demetriades has his own blog which he set up in 2010. The blog deals with various economic policy issues especially those pertinent to the UK, Cyprus and Greece.

Mercado de Sonora

Mercado de Sonora (Sonora Market) is a city-established traditional market, located just southeast of the historic center of Mexico City in the Colonia Merced Balbuena neighborhood. It was established in the 1950s with a number of other similar institutions in order to help regulate retail commerce in the city. This market has specialized in a variety of merchandise such as pottery, party items, and live animals — and the two which make it notable, herbal medicine and items related to magic and the occult.
Establishment.
Mercado de Sonora was one of a number of "mercados públicos" or public markets established by the city government in the 1950s, along with others such as Mercado Jamaica and the La Merced market. It is part of a number of "mercados públicos" or public markets established by the government to better organize and regulate retail commerce. It is derived from the pre-Hispanic "tianguis" or street market tradition, which still continues. It was originally set up with a large parking area for cars, but over time this space dwindled as the market grew. The official opening of the market was in 1957. For the market’s 50th anniversary in 2007, there was a large party with actress Edith González as special guest. The event also included mariachis and a "limpia" or cleansing to rid the establishment of any negative energy.
The facility.
The market is located in the Colonia Merced Balbuena neighborhood of the Venustiano Carranza borough. This site is traditionally commercial, located near an old fire station. The area used to contain exclusively narrow, haphazard streets, but around the same time as the market, a number of main thoroughfares (called "ejes") were built and now surround most of the complex. However, the areas behind the market still contain the old, narrow streets.
The building consists of a single large nave mostly constructed of metal. Inside, there are a number of narrow aisles containing stalls owned or rented by individual merchants. Most merchants are grouped by the type of merchandise they sell, such as party supplies, dishes, and pets. What little parking lot is left is filled by street vendors. On Saturday, when the market is busiest, these vendors overflow from the parking lot onto the surrounding narrow streets. These and various trucks and other vehicles block traffic, effectively closing the streets. The scene is noisy, filled with shouts of vendors and music blaring from stands selling CDs. However, this is also the time to find the widest variety of merchandise, such as nopal cactus and fresh corn from Milpa Alta, flower pots and soil from Xochimilco, and medicinal herbs from Puebla, Morelos and the State of Mexico.
However, the mass of street peddlers outside and the lack of maintenance of the building proper has deteriorated the condition of the market greatly. The peddlers nearly hide the market proper and promote a lack of security and cleanliness. The building also has not been well maintained since it was built. The lack of maintenance has led to leaky roofs, ramps and floors in very poor condition and problems with hygiene. Market representatives state that these problem are mostly due to corruption of borough authorities, who are also known to extort money from market merchants. There have been attempts to clear the street vendors from the parking areas of the market, with the last sweep occurring in 2002.
Medicinal herbs and magical items.
What makes this market different and famous are the aisles dedicated to medicinal plants, magic and the occult, which are only two located in the back of the large nave. This part of the market attracts customers from most socioeconomic levels, as well as tourists. as it is promoted in various guide books. The two types of products, herbal medicines and magical/occult items, are not completely separate, as for centuries traditional Mexican herbal medicine has been strongly linked with religious and magic practices. The variety of medicinal plants sold is vast and include avocado leaves for inflammations, chiranthodendron for the heart, jacaranda flowers for the stomach and more. There is also dried rattlesnake, which is considered a medicine against cancer, dried skunk to “strengthen the blood,” and starfish. Plant items more strongly associated with magic and religion include crosses of ocote wood for good luck, chains of garlic to ward off evil and a seed called "deer's eye" to protect against the “evil eye.”
The market sells occult items related to magic (white and black), pre-Hispanic religious and magical traditions, Santería, the cult of Santa Muerte, shamanism, and various others which demonstrate the syncretism of beliefs and practices that exist in the city. The market is one of the city’s centers for practices related to Santería and the worship of Santa Muerte. It is estimated that 2,000 people each weekend come to the market specifically for this section of the market. Items for sale include amulets, horseshoes, candles in a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors, with many of the colors have very specific functions, gold dust, black salt, powders of unknown ingredients, water of Saint Ignatius-to ward off unwanted attention, aromatic lotions and soaps, many of which are related to love spells and more.
The most popular items are those related to love. There are candles, oils, amulets, soaps, needles, lotions, tobacco, herbs, and services such as spell casting and cleansings all geared to finding, keeping or recovering love. Products have names such as "atrapahombres" (trap men), "ven a mi" (come to me), "miel de amor" (honey of love) and "Amansa guapos" (tame handsome men). Most are related to ritual use of some kind, even as simple as burning a candle. Others are more complex with a mix of occult and standard religious practice. As late as the 1990s, before medical abortion was legalized in Mexico City, one herbal remedy sought in the market was one to promote the termination of a pregnancy. Those who sold it did not give the treatment, rather they instructed the client what to use and how. The client was responsible for preparing the mixtures and taking them in order to take on the medical and legal risks onto themselves. Medical risks were serious as the treatment always led to excessive hemorrhaging which would require medical attention. During the H1N1 flu scare in 2009, business fell at the market about 50%. However, for herbal medicine sellers, demand for a 10-herb blend designed to prevent and treat the flu kept a number of vendors solvent. The remedy includes eucalyptus, bougainvillea and tejocote fruit, selling for 80 pesos per kilo. During the same time period, merchants selling Santa Muerte paraphernalia reported selling a significant number of white dresses for the images, as the color is associated with health and purity.
Cartonería, Day of the Dead, Judas and alebrijes.
Mercado de Sonora is one of the traditional markets for purchasing items related to Day of the Dead in Mexico City on 2 November. During this time, the aisles fill with items such as sugar skulls, "papel picado" (crepe paper cut into designs and hung like flags), representations of skeletons and more. There is Halloween influence as well, with items made to resemble witches, ghosts, Jack-o'-lanterns, etc.
The market and the area around it are also known for the making of large and small paper sculptures called "cartonería". This is a tradition that goes back hundreds of years, creating figures and other decoration for use in community festivals. The busiest times for cartonería artists is Day of the Dead, when the demand for decorations, especially skeletons is highest, and Holy Week, when there is demand for the depiction of evil called “Judas” which is burned in effigy. The Judas figures are inspired by the disciple that betrayed Jesus, but traditionally is depicted as a devil. However, other unliked figures can also substituted. These include political figures, especially those who have been involved in a recent corruption scandal.
The best-known of the "cartonería" artists is the Linares family, which has been creating figures for five generations. For this family, like most others, it began as a seasonal occupation, but in the first half of the 20th century, Pedro Linares conceived of making fantastic monsters of "cartonería" which he called "alebrijes". Over time, these creations became famous, culminating in international acclaim by the 1970s, and are in demand by collectors, galleries and museums. The craft inspired a similar one in Oaxaca, Linares’ home state, made with local wood and generally much smaller, but still fantastic creatures painted in bright patterns and bold designs. In 1990, Linares received the distinguished National Award for Science and Art from the Mexican government. The Linares family continues to make "alebrijes" and more traditional figures in their workshops located just behind the Mercado de Sonora.
Other merchandise.
The other aisles of the market are also dedicated to a number of specialties. Some areas are dedicated to pottery and dishes for everyday use, much of which is from the state of Guanajuato. These include plates, bowls, jars for atole, coffee cups, large platters and more. While traditional pottery still dominates, it is also interspersed with cheaper glass items as well. Another traditional area sells toys and party favors. Traditional wooden, cloth and clay toys can still be found, although they are slowly being replaced with cheaper plastic ones. These include dolls, tops, yo yos, cup-and-ball and many more. This area also carries party supplies such as hats, decorations and piñatas, mostly for children’s events. The area also contains costumes for children, such as animals like rabbits and bears as well as princesses and ballerinas. There are also traditional “indito” (little Indian) outfits mostly used in schools on Corpus Christi.
There is also a section that sells live animals, from baby chicks, puppies, kittens, toucans, parrots, hamsters, full grown roosters and hens, ducks, rabbits and various species of snakes. Animals also include exotic species, including some in danger of extinction, which has cause the police to raid the market. Eggs which can be hatched are also for sale for a number of species, including peacock.

BARREL

Balloon Array for RBSP Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) is a NASA mission operated out of Dartmouth College that works with the Van Allen Probes mission (formerly known as the Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission). The BARREL project will launch 20 balloons from Antarctica during each of two balloon campaigns in January 2013 and January 2014. Unlike the football-field-sized balloons typically launched at the Poles, these are each just 90 feet in diameter.
Scientific Objectives.
BARREL will help study the Van Allen Radiation Belts and why they wax and wane over time. Each BARREL balloon will carry instruments to measure particles ejected from the Belts which make it all the way to Earth's atmosphere. By comparing such data to that of RBSP—which will be up beyond the atmosphere observing the Belts from a closer viewpoint—the two experiments can try to correlate observations in the Radiation Belts with the number of particles ejected. This will help distinguish between various theories of what causes electron loss in the Belts.
Organization.
The Principal Investigator is Robyn Millan at Dartmouth College. Co-Investigator institutions are University of Washington, U. C. Berkeley, and U. C. Santa Cruz. BARREL is part of NASA's Living With a Star program. Support for the Antarctica balloon campaigns is provided by the National Science Foundation, British Antarctic Survey, and South African National Antarctic Program.
