JNR dismissal lawsuit

The JNR dismissal lawsuit is a lawsuit that resulted from the privatization of Japanese National Railways (JNR) in 1987, and its breakup into the seven Japan Railways Group companies. In March 1990, 1,047 mostly union workers were laid off, 966 of whom were from the National Railway Workers' Union (Kokuro), and two decades of lawsuits followed. The dispute was eventually settled in June 2010 for 20 billion yen, or about 22 million yen per worker for 904 plaintiffs.
Background.
Plans for privatization.
JNR, organized as a public corporation in 1949, had become unprofitable over subsequent decades. In the 1980s the Liberal Democratic Party government of prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone decided to privatize the organization. Around this time other government bodies were also either wholly or partially privatized, such as Japan Tobacco and NTT in 1985.
Unionization of JNR workers.
The 326,000 workforce of JNR was highly unionized, with workers represented by a number of unions. By far the largest union was the National Railway Workers' Union (Kokuro), with 200,000 members. National Railway Motive Power Union (Doro), which had split off from Kokuro in 1951, had 38,000 members. Zendoro, which had been expelled from Doro in 1974, had 3,000 members. Doro-Chiba, which broke off from Doro in 1979, had 1,100 members.
November 28 1985 strike.
Doro-Chiba staged a 24 hour strike on November 28, 1985, to protest against the plans to privatize JNR and lay off workers. The government strongly condemned the strike, as government workers in Japan are forbidden to strike. In addition there were a number of acts of sabotage and vandalism that stranded 10 million commuters in Tokyo and 200,000 in Osaka. The 24-hour strike caused 135 trains between Tokyo and Chiba prefecture to be cancelled, and JNR's management decided to fire more than 100 workers for staging the illegal walkout. 
Middle Core Faction November 28 1985 sabotage.
In addition to the Doro-Chiba strike, a substantial amount of sabotage was done by the then-1,300 member strong radical leftist group Middle Core Faction, who claimed responsibility and said their actions were to support Doro-Chiba's strike. Communications lines were cut, fires were set at 27 locations in seven prefectures, and heavy damage was done to Asakusabashi Station in Tokyo around 7 a.m. by masked figures wearing helmets and throwing firebombs. No injuries were reported. Police raided offices of the Middle Core Faction and Doro-Chiba, and damage to bullet trail lines near Hiroshima that delayed trains between Tokyo and Kyushu appeared to have been caused by a time bomb and by noon 48 people were arrested, including leaders of the Middle Core Faction. Representatives of the larger Kokuro and Zendoro unions representing JNR workers condemned the "anti-social" attacks and apologized to commuters. According to sources inside the labor movement, Doro-Chiba was controlled by the Middle Core Faction.
Doro-Chiba Union Chairman Hiroshi Nakano later issued a statement saying that: "The attacks have nothing to do with the union." Of the 48 suspects arrested, 46 were from the Middle Core Faction and two were from the National Railway Workers' Union. Two of the suspects were later released.
Layoffs.
JNR unions were opposed to the privatization, and when it occurred, around 7,600 workers were not rehired by the privatized companies. Many of these were members of the National Railway Workers' Union (Kokuro), now affiliated to the National Trade Union Council (Zenrokyo), and the National Railway Locomotive Engineers' Union (Zendoro), now affiliated to the National Confederation of Trade Unions (Zenroren) as part of the All Japan Construction, Transport and General Workers' Union ("Kenkoro-Tetsudo Honbu"). There was substantial pressure on union members to leave their unions, and within a year, Kokuro's membership fell from 200,000 to 44,000. Workers who had supported the privatization, or those who left Kokuro, were hired at substantially higher rates than Kokuro members.
There was a government pledge that no one would be "Thrown out onto the street", so unhired workers were classified as "needing to be employed" and were transferred to the JNR Settlement Corporation, where they could be assigned for up to three years.
Around 7,600 workers were transferred in this way, and around 2,000 of them were hired by JR firms, and 3,000 found work elsewhere. Mitomu Yamaguchi, a former JNR employee from Tosu in Saga prefecture who had been transferred to the JNR Settlement Corporation, later stated that their help in finding work consisted of giving him photocopies of recruitment ads from newspapers. 
This period ended in April 1990, and 1,047 were dismissed. This included 64 Zendoro members and 966 Kokuro members. There were also 12 Doro-Chiba members who were not hired by the new companies, the reason given being that they had participated in the November 1985 strike.
Legal, administrative, and political campaign for rehiring.
Labor Commission cases.
In 1987, the Central Labor Relations Commission in Tokyo ruled that the JR Group had to either rehire or compensate workers who were not hired when JNR was privatized. The Labor Commission ruled that it was an Unfair Labor Practice as the members of Kokuro had been targeted, and anti-union discrimination is illegal under article seven of Japan's Trade Union Act. It also ruled that the JR Group companies, not the defunct JNR, were responsible.
A group of 23 petitions filed after 1991 alleged that 1,800 union members in six prefectures had been discriminated against in violation of article seven of the Trade Union Act of 1949. Local labor relations commissions recognized discrimination in three prefectures, (Kanagawa, Tokyo, and Akita) and an order for redress was issued. The company appealed this to the Central Labour Relations Commission in Tokyo. The Central Labour Relations Commission brokered a deal, and in 2005, Kokuro withdrew the 23 cases claiming anti-union discrimination against its members. In return, the company paid compensation estimated at 360 million yen.
From 1987 to 2006, Kokuro filed 340 complaints with various labor relations commissions, mostly related to the dismissal of the 1,047 JNR workers. In November 2006 the union and JR East struck an agreement to settle 61 related to discrimination against union members employed by JR. Kokuro agreed to withdraw the labor commission cases, and JR East agreed to pay compensation. This was considered to be a major step forward in reconciling Kokuro to JR.
Lawsuits.
The post-privatization dismissals resulted in a number of lawsuits. In 1994 and 1995, six JR Group companies brought lawsuits in the Tokyo District Court over the 1987 Labor Relations Commission ruling that the JR group was responsible for the non-hiring and that unfair labor practices had been committed. On May 28, 1998, rulings were handed down. In the case bought by the Honshu carriers, presiding Judge Saburo Takase said that while JR companies were responsible for selecting personnel to start up their new entities, they were not obligated to compensate unhired JNR workers. He said that if there were unfair labor practices were committed in choosing employees, the JR companies are responsible, but the labor commission should only order the firms to repeat their employment process, not to rehire the workers. He said an order to rehire unionists was illegal.
Presiding Judge Yasushige Hagio, ruling on the Hokkaido and Kyushu carriers' case, said that the JR Group companies were not responsible for personnel decisions following the JNR privatization, so he nullified the commission's order.
The Central Labor Relations Commission appealed and in December 2003, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal requesting that the former JNR employees in the labor unions that opposed the JNR privatization in 1987 be hired by the private Japan Railway companies that succeeded JNR.
The first petty bench of the Supreme Court gave a split decision. Presiding Justice Takehisa Fukazawa and Justice Niro Shimada said the JR firms bear this responsibility as employers and said the case should be sent back to the Tokyo High Court. However, the three three other justices disagreed and stated that JR bore no responsibility for any unfair labor practices that may have been committed.
In another case, of 283 plaintiffs in September 2005, the Tokyo District Court ruled that JNR had discriminated against union employees when recruiting for positions at the new JR companies.
It was the first time a court had recognized unfair labor practices by the now-defunct JNR or its affiliates and ordered compensation over the JR firms' refusal to hire JNR employees. Presiding judge Koichi Nanba ruled that the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency should pay Â¥5 million to each of the plaintiffs. Despite ruling that they had been discriminated against, he didn't order their re-hiring, stating that "There were reasonable causes for dismissal."
On December 5, 2006, at the Tokyo District Court, more than 500 Kokuro members, the union itself, and relatives of workers who died since the privatization planned to launch a 30 million yen damages lawsuit over the refusal to rehire the workers, making a total of 540 plaintiffs suing the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency. Kokuro sought compensation for the loss of union fees incurred when the JR companies did not hire the union members, but this was intended as leverage to encourage political parties to intervene and for the agency to settle the labor dispute. A Kokuro official stated: "This suit is for securing an option to solve problems through the court before the statute of limitations expires. We will consider dropping the suit when a political solution becomes feasible."
On March 13, 2008, the Tokyo District Court turned down a case filed by 32 union members and three relatives of a deceased member which had been filed in November 2004. Judge Shigeru Nakanishi said the statute of limitations had expired, regardless of whether or not unfair labor practices had occurred. He did not state an opinion on whether or not such discrimination had occurred.
First attempted political settlement.
In 2000, the ruling political bloc at the time (the Liberal Democratic Party, New Komeito, and the now-defunct New Conservative Party suggested a compromise where the lawsuits would be dropped in return for urging the JR groups to rehire the workers in return for Kokuro acknowledging that JR had no responsibility for originally failing to employ them. The opposition Social Democratic Party functioned as an intermediary between the union and the ruling parties. the Social Democratic Party is affiliated to the National Trade Union Council (Zenrokyo), the trade union confederation that Kokuro belongs to. In January 2001, Kokuro voted to accept the plan, but there were various factions within the union with different viewpoints. In 2002, with the ruling block threatening to withdraw the deal, Kokuro voted again to withdraw their lawsuits.
In November 2002, the three ruling parties withdrew from the agreement. Kokuro had agreed to it but did not expel members who refused to accept it and had launched a separate lawsuit against the JNR Settlement Corporation in January 2002.
International Labor Organization view.
Kokuro and Zendoro bought the case to the International Labor Organization, claiming anti-union discrimination and that this violated the right to organize as stipulated in the ILO Convention No. 98 concerning freedom of association. They brought the case to the ILO Committee on the Freedom of Association for settlement. The committee wrote a report which was then approved by the ILO's ruling body. The ILO's view was that that the dismissed workers "were not hired by the JR companies not because of discrimination against the labor unions but because their members had refused wide-area transfers to other regions."
Towards a final settlement.
After the 2009 election victory of the Democratic Party of Japan, the coalition of three ruling parties; the Democratic Party of Japan, Social Democratic Party and Kokumin Shinto plus the opposition party New Komeito drafted a settlement package. In the settlement plan the former JR workers were to receive Â¥29.5 million each.
An attached document described the dismissal of the 1047 former JNR workers as "an unfair labor practice on an unprecedented scale." The proposed settlement package included a Â¥28 billion financial component, and a request for the JR companies to hire around 230 former JNR workers aged up to 55.
In April 2010, then-transport minister Seiji Maehara, announced that he and then-deputy prime minister Naoto Kan and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano finalized plans for a settlement. The JR group companies were reluctant to rehire the workers, so that part of the settlement was abandoned. The political parties had proposed Â¥24 million yen per worker, the government had proposed Â¥20 million. The figure was settled at Â¥22 million. The total settlement amount was reduced to Â¥20 billion, to be divided into payments of Â¥22 million each for 910 households of "reconciliation money," making a total of Â¥14.2 billion. Kokuro and other bodies were to receive Â¥5.8 billion to be used to help the former workers find work.
Settlement.
Settlement details.
23 years after the original privatization, on June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court settled the dispute between the workers and the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency. The agency said it would pay 20 billion yen, approximately 22 million yen per worker, to 904 plaintiffs. However, as the workers were not reinstated, it was not a full settlement.
Pursuant to Paragraph 1 of the settlement, Kokuro and Kenkoro (Zendoro) dropped all its lawsuits, including unfair labor practice litigation not directly related to the firing of the 1,047 workers. Pursuant to Paragraph 2 of the settlement, Kokuro and Kenkoro did not file any unfair labor practice lawsuit thereafter.
Doro-Chiba's rejection of settlement.
Doro-Chiba is a union which in 1979 split off from Doro (the National Railway Motor Power Union). Doro merged with Tetsuro, a company union which had split off from Kokuro decades ago, and formed JR-Soren (Japan Confederation of Railway Workers' Unions --JRU) and actively promoted the privatization of JNR. Doro-Chiba had nine members who were not employed by JR after the privatization in 1987 and the union refused to accept the 2010 settlement. The union vowed to continue the struggle against the dismissals and against the privatization of JNR.

Type specimen (mineralogy)

In mineralogy, the type specimen, also known as type material, is a reference sample by which a mineral is defined.
Types.
The following definitions for kinds of type specimens were approved in 1987 by the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names and the Commission on Museums of the International Mineralogical Association (IMA).
A holotype is a single specimen from which the original description of the mineral can be determined in whole.
Cotypes are multiple specimens from which quantitative, but not necessary, data are obtained for the original mineral description.
A neotype is a new specimen for the redefinition or reexamination of a mineral when the holotype or cotypes cannot be located or, upon examination, are inadequate for study.
Purpose.
Type specimens are valuable when a mineral species is reevaluated because the original description of a mineral may be incomplete or contain errors.
History.
Whereas the system of type specimens has long-existed in the biological sciences, this is not the case in mineralogy. The recentness of the practice means that sometimes no type material exists, even for minerals discovered as recently as the twentieth century. The publication of "Type specimens in mineralogy" by P.G. Embrey and M.H. Hey in 1970 stimulated much discussion on type specimens, leading to formal definitions approved by the IMA in 1987.
Nowadays, deposition of the type material in a professionally curated museum is required by the Commission on New Minerals, Nomenclature and Classification of the IMA when approving a new mineral species.

Louisiana Highway 3114

Louisiana Highway 3114 (LA 3114) was a state highway in Louisiana that served St. Tammany Parish. It spanned a total of along the present route of U.S. 190 on the north side of Covington.
Route description.
From the west, LA 3114 began at an intersection with U.S. 190 just northwest of the Covington city limits. It headed northeast to an intersection with LA 25. LA 3114 was an undivided, two-lane highway for its entire length.
History.
The Covington Bypass was conceived in the mid-1950s as part of a series of highway improvements associated with the construction of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. The bypass was to provide an alternate route around the downtown area for traffic on U.S. 190 and LA 25. Only half of the project was constructed at the time, the "eastern" segment from the Bogue Falaya River Bridge (at the current junction of U.S. 190, U.S. 190 Business, and LA 21) north to the current junction of U.S. 190 and LA 25. This segment was completed in 1957 and became the new routing of LA 25.
A decade later, in October 1967, construction began on the segment extending west from LA 25. This segment was designated as LA 3114 and was opened to traffic in January 1969. Two years later, it became the new routing of U.S. 190, and the old alignment through town became U.S. 190 Business. With this change, the LA 3114 designation was dropped, and LA 25 was truncated to its current terminus at U.S. 190 on the north side of Covington.

KCTD7

Potassium channel tetramerisation domain containing 7 is a protein in humans that is encoded by the KCTD7 gene. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.
Description.
The KCTD7 gene encodes a member of the potassium channel tetramerisation domain-containing protein family. Family members are identified on a structural basis and contain an amino-terminal domain similar to the T1 domain present in the voltage-gated potassium channel. KCTD7 displays a primary sequence and hydropathy profile indicating intracytoplasmic localization. EST database analysis showed that KCTD7 is expressed in human and mouse brain.
Function.
KCTD7 expression hyperpolarizes the cell membrane and reduces the excitability of transfected neurons in patch clamp experiments. KCTD7 mRNA and protein are expressed in hippocampal neurons, deep layers of the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells of the murine brain as shown by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry experiments. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrates that KCTD7 is able to prudhommerie and directly interacts with cullin-3 (CUL3), a component of the ubiquitin ligase complex. These interactions are thought to be mediated via the BTB/POZ domain of KCTD7. However, KCTD7 does not show any interaction cullin-1 (CUL1). Immunoprecipitation assays also shows that KCTD7 does not interact with Ubiquitin-flag, suggesting a potential role of KCTD7 in the ubiquitin ligase complex without being itself subject to uiquitination. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows a cytosolic expression of the recombinant GFP-KCTD7 protein in transfected COS-7 cells.
One possible hypothesis is that KCTD7 regulates indirectly the membrane expression level of a potassium channel. By conjugating with cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KCTD7 may modulate the expression level of a negative regulator of potassium channel. Therefore, the overexpression of KCTD7 in neurons would increase the degradation of that regulatory molecule leading to the increase of potassium current through the cell membrane as observed in patch clamp experiments.
In cultured mouse hippocampal cells, expression is found in the cell soma, in neuritic varicosities along the developing neuronal extensions, and in neurite growth cones, but not in the nucleus. Kctd7 is widely expressed in neurons throughout the intact mouse brain, including in cortical neurons, in granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus, and in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, not all neuronal cells are immunopositive for Kctd7, and expression is not seen in astrocytes or microglial cells. Expression is constant from P5 to 2 months in cerebellar lysates. Overexpression of KCTD7 in HeLa and COS-1 cells, which do not express endogenous KCTD7, shows diffuse cytosolic localization, with no colocalization with markers for endosomes, ER, Golgi, lysosomes, or the cytoskeleton.
Beside the BTB/POZ domain of KCTD7, other residues are critical for its proper interaction with cullin-3. Furthermore, a full-length 31-kD Kctd7 isoform is expressed in mouse brain. Other major immunoreactive bands included a 28-kD species in the spleen, liver, and kidneys, a 37-kD species in the kidneys, and a 62-kD form most likely corresponding to a stable dimer. The presence of multiple bands was consistent with alternative splicing and tissue-specific regulation.
Clinical significance.
In 3 affected members of a large consanguineous Moroccan family with progressive myoclonic epilepsy-3, a homozygous nonsense mutation in the KCTD7 gene (R99X) has been identified.
In 2 Mexican siblings with infantile onset of progressive myoclonic epilepsy and pathologic findings of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in multiple cell types, a homozygous mutation in the KCTD7 gene (R184C) has been identified. The mutation was identified by whole-exome sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This phenotype has been identified as CLN14. KCTD7 mutations were not found in 32 additional CLN samples.

Cassandra Bankson

Cassandra Bankson (born November 11, 1992) is an American model and online personality from San Francisco, California. She has been featured on "Good Morning America", "The Today Show", and The Anderson Cooper Show, among other international television shows. She has been featured in magazines including Vogue, Seventeen, Glamour Magazine, Forbes, In Touch Weekly, US Weekly, and the Cover of Reveal Magazine, UK and newspapers The New York Post, SUN UK, and Pleasanton Weekly.
Early life.
Cassandra Bankson was born to Jennifer and Richard Bankson in San Francisco California. Cassandra grew up in the affluent suburbs of the San Francisco bay area and was raised in a predominately Christian household. At age 8 Cassandra developed a rather innocuous strain of Acne vulgaris which later transformed into an aggressive strain of acne conglobata by the time she was fourteen. Eventually her severe skin condition had progressed to the extent that it engulfed her entire face and most of her body. Cassandra's parents tried tirelessly to treat their daughters acne by taking her to 16 different specialists across the United States and western Europe which unfortunately proved unsuccessful. Cassandra was bullied relentlessly for her severe acne and eventually pulled out of school as a result. She later studied with a private tutor to complete her education.
Modeling career.
Bankson had been working with local professional photographers and model coach Charelston Pierce when she decided to submit professional shots to modeling agencies in San Francisco.
Bankson attended auditions for America's Next Top Mode in Blackhawlk and Los Angeles, but did not make it to the televised stages. Bankson has modeled for companies including "Citizens of Humanity", "HP", "Davidson and Licht", "Farouk Hair Systems", "Guess By Marciano" "CHI" (with Miss America Contestants and Abel Salazar), "Biosilk", Prada, "Bebe", along with appearing in other catalogs, magazines, local TV programmes, and runway shows. 
In April and May 2012, Bankson took part in appearances throughout "Sephora" stores in partnership with "Hourglass Cosmetics".
On September 13, 2012, Bankson walked at the Boy Meets Girl runway show at New York Fashion Week.
YouTube career.
In 2010, Bankson began making videos on the YouTube channel "Diamondsandheels14" on topics such as makeup, fashion and lifestyle.
The channel's most popular video, titled "Foundation Routine For Flawless Skin Acne Coverage", showing Bankson's bare skin and her secrets to cover her severe acne, gained international attention including that of Right This Minute, Good Morning America, "Anderson", The Today Show, The Insider, MSN, Fox News, and the front page of AOL, Yahoo, and MSN. After posting the video, she didn't look at the comments for four months, afraid of being bullied online. She posted the video hoping it would help "just one person".
The video has since gained well over 21 million views.
Bankson "made it her mission" to help others with makeup, confidence, acne, and skin conditions online. Her daily videos have also received international press and media attention She is a 'vlogger', and has also posted videos for men who suffer with acne. 
As of 2013, her YouTube channel has over 619,000 subscribers and 85 million video views. Along with YouTube, Bankson has a large following on other social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.
Her story and her popular YouTube video were featured in an episode of Investigation Discovery's Karma's A B*tch.

In the early ages it was called (STATE OF DITCHKOT) and where the town was situated, now there is a graveyard consisting 95 kanal and 13 marla. The word Dijkot belongs to local language word ?Ditch? which means fort or a city inside the fort.
Ditch was a famous warrior tribe of the area. 1st time the city was destroyed, as the history shows, in 326 BC when Deputy Commander of the great Alexander attacked this state. Resultantly a few people were remained lived. They rehabilitated the city again. Then the CHUNDAR GUPT MORIA (322 BC -316BC) gave the importance to this town. In 712 AD Muhammad bin Qasim attacked the Sindh and reached to the Chiniot and probably he was arrested from this area. In 1460 the tribes of surrounding of Ditchkot attacked the state and once again the state was completely destroyed. For long time the area could not be rehabilitated. Then a saint Baba Sher Shah lived on the south of this old state. Then a new city began to develop during the Sher Shah Soori time.

Special Operations Craft â Riverine (SOC-R)

Special Operations Craft - Riverine craft perform short-range insertion and extraction of special operations forces in river and near-shore environments.
The SOC-R is designed to fit aboard C-130 or larger military aircraft. Special Boat Teams (SBT) perform an insertion/extraction delivery system called MEATS. MEATS allows an Army CH-47D helicopter to carry a SOC-R rigged to the underbelly of the helicopter with slings. The Combatant-Craft Crewmen use a rope to get from the helicopter onto the craft for insertions, and a ladder dropped down from the helicopter to get off the SOC-R craft when extracted.
Each craft is manned by a crew of four Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) crew-members and can carry eight personnel. Members of Special Boat Team 22 (SBT-22), based in Stennis, MS, who make up a tiny fraction of the total SWCCs, are the only ones who operate the SOC-R. These river crews conduct mainly clandestine combat missions, often operating at night with little or no air support.
The SOC-R speed and tight turn radius are facilitated by the hull design. The slope of the SOC-R's V-shape belly essentially allows the boat to skate along the surface, with relatively little drag on the hull. Thanks to the waterjet propulsion, there is no hanging rudder or propeller blades to snag on submerged roots and rocks.
The SOC-R's five weapon mounts provide a 360-degree field of fire. The aft-mounted .50 cal covers the boat crew as they leave the shore after an extraction.

Osman Mohamud

Osman Mohamud (often known as Buurmadow; born c. 1965) is a clan elder from Somaliland, a self-declared republic that is internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia.
Biography.
Mohamud is known for his efforts at mediating regional conflicts, particularly among clans in northern Somalia.
On 17 November 2011, he was arrested in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), visiting his wife who resides there while returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca. The government never offered formal charges against him, prompting Amnesty International to issue an alert on his behalf; the group later speculated that UAE had arrested him at the prompting of Somaliland authorities. Mohamud was released on 5 January 2012.
Upon returning to Somaliland on 15 March, Mohamud was arrested at the airport in Hargeisa. After forty days of detention, the local government charged him with what it termed "anti-national activity of a citizen abroadâ, "subversive or anti-national propaganda" and "continuing offence" in response to a comment he had made while in the UAE criticizing a trip to China by President Ahmed Mahamoud Silanyo of Somaliland. On 8 July, these charges were dismissed and replaced by a charge of "insulting a public official", of which the judge found Mohamud guilty. Mohamud was subsequently sentenced to one year in prison for defamation, according to local law based on the colonial period Italian Somaliland penal code. Amnesty International responded by declaring Mohamud a prisoner of conscience, detained "for exercising his right to freedom of expression". 
On 18 July, the Somaliland government pardoned Mohamud, apparently in response to international pressure, and he returned to his home in Hargeisa.

Buller River (Western Australia)

The Buller River is a river in the Mid West of Western Australia, near Geraldton. 
The river is a short coastal stream of around 10Â km length just to the north of Geraldton, in the Drummond Cove and Oakajee areas. The headwaters of the river are north of Geraldton. The Buller flows in a southerly direction, initially following the east side of the North West Coastal Highway to a point north of Drummond Cove, where it turns to the west, to discharge into the Indian Ocean.
History.
The Buller River was named on 7 April 1839 by the explorer George Grey while on his second disastrous expedition along the Western Australian coast, probably after Charles Buller M.P., an associate of Edward Gibbon Wakefield and Grey's friend William Hutt (brother of the 2nd Governor of Western Australia, John Hutt), and an active parliamentary proponent of the free colonization of South Australia, Western Australia and New Zealand.

NGC Bocas Lit Fest

The NGC Bocas Lit Fest is the Trinidad and Tobago literary festival that takes place annually during the last weekend of April. Inaugurated in 2011, it is the first major literary festival in the southern Caribbean and largest literary festival in the Anglophone Caribbean. A registered non-profit company, the festival has as its title sponsor the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC). Other partners include the Commonwealth Foundation and One Caribbean Media (OCM), who sponsor the associated OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature. 
Another new award in partnership with Bocas is the Hollick Arvon Caribbean Writers Prize, sponsored by the Hollick Family Charitable Trust and the literary charitable trust the Arvon Foundation, with the aim of allowing an emerging Caribbean writer living and working in the Anglophone Caribbean to devote time to developing a literary work, with support from an established writer as mentor. The award was announced at the Bocas Lit Fest in 2012 by Sue Woodford-Hollick, and the first winner in 2013 was Barbara Jenkins.
The Henry Swanzy Award for Distinguished Service to Caribbean Letters (named after the influential producer of the BBC radio programme "Caribbean Voices" that ran from 1943 to 1958) was inaugurated at the 2013 NGC Bocas Lit Fest, as an "annual lifetime achievement award to recognise service to Caribbean literature by editors, publishers, critics, broadcasters, and others". 
The Bocas Lit Fest additionally administers the Burt Award for Caribbean authors of literature for young adults, also launched in 2013.
Background.
The festival organising team comprises Marina Salandy-Brown, founder and director; Nicholas Laughlin, editor of the "Caribbean Review of Books", Funso Aiyejina, prize-winning author and dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Education at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Marjorie Thorpe, former professor of literature at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, independent bookseller Joan Dayal; Danielle Delon, editor of "The Letters of Margaret Mann", local businesswoman Lucita Esau, and Patrice Matthews, a marketing and media professional.
The festival's name derives from the Spanish word for mouth, â"boca"â â the organ of speech and song and storytelling â while also referencing the Bocas del DragÃ³n (the Dragon's Mouths), which are the narrow straits off Trinidadâs north-west peninsula that connect the Gulf of Paria to the Caribbean Sea. For centuries, the Bocas were the gateways connecting Trinidad to the Caribbean and the Atlantic Ocean. 
The festival's strapline is: âCelebrating books, writers, and writing from the Caribbean and the rest of the worldâ. The scores of writers taking part in the 2012 festival were both locally-based and from abroad, including Fred D'Aguiar, Earl Lovelace, Vahni Capildeo, Chika Unigwe, Monique Roffey, Kenneth Ramchand, Mervyn Morris, Achy Obejas, Rabindranath Maharaj, George Lamming, professor of genetics Steve Jones, Merle Hodge, Rahul Bhattacharya, and Michael Anthony. The festival featured readings, discussions, performances, workshops, screenings of films based on Caribbean writing and music.
The main venues are the National Library (NALIS) and the Old Fire Station, in downtown Port of Spain.
There is also a full programme of activities for young readers, sponsored by KFC, and in the run-up to the festival storytelling events take place in Tobago, Couva, Chaguanas, San Fernando, Point Fortin, Mayaro and Arima.
Caribbean Literature Action Group (CALAG).
Launched in 2012 was the Caribbean Literature Action Group (CALAG), a new partnership between the NGC Bocas Lit Fest, the British Council, and Commonwealth Writers, aimed at supporting the development of Caribbean writing and publishing.

<doc id="36538245" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36538245" title="Ligia cinerascens">
Ligia cinerascens

Ligia cinerascens is a woodlouse in the family Ligiidae. 
Description.
"L.Â cinerascens" is very similar to "L.Â occidentalis" with more antenna segments but shorter overall antenna length. It can be distinguished from "L.Â exotica" by its shorter antennae and uropods, as well as its uniformay gray color and granular texture. The species name "cinerascens" comes from the Latin for "ashy," referring to the gray color of this species.
Life Cycle.
In the wild, "L.Â cinerascens" usually lives about 1 year (overwintering once) but occasionally lives up to 2.5 years (overwintering twice). Females breed in their first year for five months, then die before the second winter, typically producing one brood - two at the most. Reared in the lab, "L.Â cinerascens" has a longer lifespan and may produce 3 or more broods in a lifetime.
"L.Â cinerascens" are parasitized by Thinoseius setifer, a mite attaching to the ligia's pleopods. 
Distribution.
G. H. A. Budde-Lund found samples of "L.Â cinerascens" on a long ocean exploration, and when he returned he couldn't remember if they had come from Japan, Manila or Chile, limiting our current knowledge of the full range of the species. It has also been found on Kuril Islands (specifically Kunashir Island) and Peter the Great Gulf in far western Russia. It is one of four ligia species to be found on Japanese coasts. Specifically, it is found mainly on Hokkaido, with a separate population in Tokyo Bay.

Rolando Antonio PÃ©rez FernÃ¡ndez

Rolando Antonio PÃ©rez FernÃ¡ndez (b. Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, 1947) is a renowned Cuban musicologist, cellist and professor.
Academic background.
Rolando PÃ©rez initiated his musical Studies in Santiago de Cuba, where he also began his career as cellist under the guidance of distinguished performer and professor Ernesto XancÃ³. In 1976 he graduated from Music Medium Level in the specialty of violoncello at Havana Municipal Conservatory âAmadeo RoldÃ¡nâ. This same year, after the inauguration of the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) and the School of Musicology in the same educational institution, Rolando PÃ©rez began his studies in that area, which was founded by Cuban musicologist Argeliers LeÃ³n, after concluding his Studies, Rolando PÃ©rez received the degree of âLicenciado en MÃºsica con especializaciÃ³n en MusicologÃ­aâ from the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA). En 1999, he also received the degree of âDoctor en Ciencias del Arte,â from the same educational institution.
Work as cellist.
Rolando PÃ©rez served as cellist in the Cuban National Symphony Orchestra from 1969 to 1981, as well as between 1987 and 1992.
He has also participated in ensembles and recordings of concert and popular music such as: Cuarteto de cuerdas by Carlos Malcolm, and âEl ropavejero,â by Francisco Barrios âEl Mastuerzoâ,together with the Mexican rockân roll group âBotellita de Jerezâ.
Work as musicologist.
As musicological researcher, Rolando PÃ©rez has collaborated with the âCentro de InvestigaciÃ³n y Desarrollo de la MÃºsica Cubanaâ from 1981 to 1987. He has also participated as speaker in numerous cogresses and lectures, among which we can mention the following: âColoquio Interdisciplinario sobre Ritmo, Universidad de Salamanca (1993),â âEncuentro Latinoamericano sobre ReligiÃ³n y Etnicidad, Universidad Javeriana, BogotÃ¡ (1996),â âInternational Conference ââMusical Cultures of Latin America: Global Effects, Past and Present,ââ UCLA (1999),â âSociety for Ethnomusicology South East and Caribbean Chapter Annual Meeting, FSU, Tallahassee, Florida (2002),â âCongreso Internacional de la AsociaciÃ³n Latinoamericana de Estudios AfroasiÃ¡ticos, UNAM/Colegio de MÃ©xico, MÃ©xico DF (2003),â âCongreso de la IASPM Rama Latinoamericana, La Habana 2006,â and the âII Congreso Venezolano de MÃºsica Popular, Caracas (2006).â
Work as professor.
From 1993 until the present, Rolando PÃ©rez has worked as professor in the area of Etnomusicology at the National School of Music of the âUniversidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xicoâ (UNAM), where he currently holds a tenure as âProfesor de Tiempo Completo, Titular âAâ Interino.â 
Publications.
Throughout his long career as musicologist and researcher, Rolando PÃ©rez has published the following books: ââLa binarizaciÃ³n de los ritmos ternarios africanos en AmÃ©rica Latinaââ (Casa de las AmÃ©ricas, La Habana, 1987) and ââLa mÃºsica afromestiza mexicanaââ (Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa (Veracruz), 1990). In the first of those books (which won the musicology award from Cuban cultural institution âCasa de las AmÃ©ricasâ in 1982), he proposes a theory which is deeply rooted in the musicological problematic of Latin America and a methodology which could be developed in comparative studies created within the Continent. The text is comprised by three chapters in which the author begins by analyzing general aspects related to the presence of the African population in Latin America, his contributions to music and to the socio-historical context within which those processes have evolved. In the second chapter he describes in detail the characteristics of the African rhythm style and its fusion with the Hispanic style. In the third chapter he develops his own personal conclusions about what he describes as: âthe binarization process of the African ternary rhythmsâ, their specific behavior and the consequences of this process for the cultural development of the musical culture in Cuba and Latin America. His reflections are illustrated with numerous musical examples. In his second book, PÃ©rez FernÃ¡ndez intends to demonstrate the importance of the African contribution to the integration of the music of Mexico, as well as to provide facts that may support, within the musicological field, the conclusions of Mexican anthropologist Gonzalo Aguirre BeltrÃ¡n in reference to the concept that the Mexican creole music is fundamentally a result of the cultural fusion between the Spanish and the African population.
In addition, this author has written numerous articles and book chapters, not just focused in the African musical contributions in Latino America, but also extending his interest to Linguistics, Epistemology and History, as well as to the contribution of the Chinese musical traditions to the Cuban culture.
In those areas of study we shold mention works such as:
The outstanding work of PÃ©rez FernÃ¡ndez constitutes an important point of reference for current and future investigations focusing on the study of the African influence in the music of Latin America. In this regard, his ideas, articles and books have been commented, quoted and reviewed within and outside the American Continent by several prominent researchers such as: Steven Loza, James Robbins, JosÃ© Jorge de Carvalho, Isabel Aretz, Kofi Agawu, Ãngel G. Quintero Rivera, Juan Pablo GonzÃ¡lez, Antonio GarcÃ­a de LeÃ³n, Helmut Enrique Greiner, Carlos Reynoso and Gonzalo Aguirre BeltrÃ¡n, among others.

Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission

The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC), is a United States organization that represents the governors of 30 member and eight associate states, and works to ensure the nation's oil and natural gas resources are conserved and utilized to their maximum potential while protecting health, safety and the environment. It was established by the charter member states' governors in 1935. The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission is the oldest and largest interstate compact in the nation.
Organizational structure.
In 1935, six states endorsed and Congress ratified the Interstate Compact to Conserve Oil and Gas, resulting in the formation of the governmental entity now known as the IOGCC. Since that time, states have established effective regulation of the oil and natural gas industry, assisted by IOGCC programs designed to gather and share information. This dialog takes place primarily during IOGCC meetings, held biannually at sites across the United States. Each member state holds one vote, exercised by the governor or delegated to the state's official representative or associate representative. Gubernatorial appointees offer their expertise to IOGCC committees. State contributions fund IOGCC operations, while projects may be funded through grants. The IOGCC does not accept petroleum industry funds for its operating expenses.

Methanesulfonyl fluoride

Methanesulfonyl fluoride (MSF) It has long been known to be a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase AChE, the enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter in both the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Technical and physical properties.
MSF is a clear, colorless to yellowish hygroscopic liquid. It is corrosive and highly toxic. It is an oxydiaphoric inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. MSF, which is a liquid at room temperature, has a vapor pressure of 19.2 mmHg, slightly more volatile than water which has a vapor pressure of 18.8 mmHg at 21 Â°C. This vapor has an LC50 in rats of between 4 and 5 ppm during one hour of exposure or between 1 and 1.2 ppm during 7 hours of exposure. MSF produced no subtle biological effects from direct action of MSF independent of its ability to inhibit cholinesterase. Repeated exposures to 1/10 of the LC50 did not produce overt systemic toxicity or significant pathology. MSF can also cause severe skin burns and serious eye damage if contact is made. It is a lachrymator and causes tears in eyes.
Methanesulfonyl fluoride has a pungent odor. It undergo decomposition on heating to liberate fumes of fluorides and sulfur oxides.
Synthesis.
A typical synthesis is to treat methanesulfonyl chloride with potassium fluoride or potassium bifluoride in water and then steam distil the product out.
Therapeutic study.
Animal studies have shown that MSF-induced inhibition of AChE is highly selective for the brain when it is studied in vivo. MSF is an irreversible inhibitor of AChE and its inhibition of AChE is only overcome by de novo synthesis new AChE in each tissue. The recovery of AChE activity in the brain is less than one-tenth as rapid as AChE recovery in the gastrointestinal system, allowing very high accumulated AChE inhibition in the brain with clinically insignificant AChE inhibition in peripheral tissues.The high selectivity of MSF for inhibition in the brain has suggested that it could be used as a treatment for dementia of the Alzheimer type, that it is effective in reducing the persistent cognitive deficit after stoke, and it is highly effective in reducing normal age-related memory impairment, making aged rats perform as well as young rats. 
Methanesulfonyl fluoride has been tested successfully in three human clinical trials as a treatment for Alzheimerâs dementia. Two Phase I clinical trials testing for safety of MSF in humans at the doses proposed for treating dementia have shown that it is well tolerated and relatively free of the side effects of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that are produced by the current cholinesterase inhibitors used for the treatment of Alzheimerâs dementia. Furthermore, a Phase II clinical trial testing both the safety and the efficacy of MSF found that it was well tolerated in the aged patients and it was highly effective in reducing the symptoms of Alzheimerâs dementia. US Patent has been issued for the use of MSF for the treatment of dementia.

Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility

Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility (AGID) is an autoimmune disease autonomic neuropathy affecting the gastrointestinal organs and digestive system of the body. Dysmotility is when the strength or coordination of the esophagus, stomach or intestines muscles do not work as they should.
Diagnosis.
AGID is diagnosed with a complete medical history, exam of patients motility and with special blood tests looking for autoantibodies consistent with neurologic autoimmunity. Blood tests included evaluations of immunofluorescence (neuronal nuclear and cytoplasmic antibodies), radioimmunoprecipitation assays (neuronal and muscle plasma membrane cation channel antibodies), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (muscle striational antibodies). A finding, along with medical history, of ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptor and N-type voltage-gated calcium channel autoantibodies in the blood stream would result in a medically acceptable diagnosis of AGID. 
Common Illnesses with AGID.
Often AGID is a symptom of other problems including colon cancer, lupus, lung, breast, or ovarian carcinoma or thymoma. or other diseases. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is the most recognized form of AGID.
Treatment.
Pyridostigmine is a pharmaceutical treatment option for patients with AGID.
In severe cases patients with AGID are required to abandon eating foods requiring them to get the nourishment through a process called parenteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition is when the patient is feed VIA a permanent IV and the liquid nourishment is infused directly in the blood stream, verses a feeding tube.

Grigoris (catholicos)

Grigoris (early fourth century AD, Caesaria Mazaca, Roman Empire â ca. 330 AD, Vatnik Valley, near present-day Derbent, Russia) was the Catholicos of the Church of Caucasian Albania ca. 325â330 AD. He is considered a saint martyr by the Armenian Apostolic Church.
Life.
Grigoris was born in Caesaria, Cappadocia and was the grandson of Gregory the Illuminator, an originally Parthian Christian missionary who founded and became the first catholicos (patriarch) of the Armenian Apostolic Church. In addition, both Grigoris' father Vrtanes and brother Husik were consecutive catholicoi of Armenia.
By 325, Christianity in Armenia had gained strength and Armenian religious leaders went on to proselytise the neighbouring states. According to the tenth-century author Movses Kaghankatvatsi, Gregory the Illuminator left Armenia to spread Christianity in Caucasian Albania, where on his orders there was built a church later to become the Amaras Monastery. He then ordained his grandson Grigoris, at the time only 15 years old, to become the patriarch of the Church of Caucasian Albania. The growing influence of Christianity and the Armenian Church greatly worried rulers of the neighbouring pagan principalities, who were unwilling to embrace the new religion. According to Faustus Byuzand, when Grigoris arrived in the Caucasian Albanian principality of Maskut (located along the northeastern Azerbaijani and south Dagestani shore of the Caspian Sea) to preach Christianity, its ruler Sanatruk (also known as Sanesan) of the local branch of Arsacides ordered him killed. Grigoris was trampled to death by mounted Maskut soldiers in the Vatnik Valley, near the present-day village of Nughdi 37 kilometres south of Derbent.
Grigoris' body was taken to the Amaras Monastery and buried in an unknown location. In 489, Vachagan III the Pious, King of Caucasian Albania, recovered Grigoris' relics and buried then in a tomb within the Amaras Monastery. Grigoris' place of death in Nughdi was marked by the construction of a chapel at an unknown date, later rebuilt into a church, and venerated by local Christians and Muslims alike.

WCW Prime

WCW Prime was a professional wrestling show produced by World Championship Wrestling which aired on Mondays from 1995 to 1997. Along with "WCW WorldWide" and "WCW Pro", it was part of the WCW Disney tapings. The rights to "WCW Prime" now belong to WWE.
Format.
"WCW Prime" mainly featured mid-card matches. There wasn't much storyline advancement or main-event wrestlers on the show. Sometimes, matches from "WCW WorldWide" and "WCW Saturday Night" were featured, along with highlights from the major shows such as "WCW Monday Nitro". The main event was referred to as the "Prime Match of the Week" on-air. The show was hosted by Dusty Rhodes and Chris Cruise, who was later replaced by Tony Schiavone. The show was a little more relaxed than the other programs, with lots of comedy on the commentary. For instance, right before the "Prime Match of the Week", Dusty Rhodes would call it the "Moo Match of the Week" and moo on-camera because of a dairy sponsorship.

Grey Lock's War

The western theatre of Father Rale's War in northern New England was referred to as "Gray Lock's War". Grey Lock distinguished himself by conducting guerrilla raids into Vermont and western Massachusetts. He consistently eluded his pursuers, and acquired the name Wawanolet (also Wawanolewat, Wawanotewat), meaning "he who fools the others, or puts someone off the track." 
Grey Lock's War was not part of the conflicts between France and England. Unlike the continuing wars between France and England that involved local natives, often to their detriment, Grey Lock's War was fought by Native Americans for their own reasons.
Grey Lock, like the majority of his people, did eventually ally himself with the French. Ancient Jesuit records from Fort Saint-FrÃ©dÃ©ric, demonstrates that this great war chief, was known to the French as la "TÃªte Blanche" (White Head). He converted to Catholicism and was baptized under the French name of Pierre-Jean, while his wife was known as HÃ©lÃ¨ne. They had a son and a daughter, Jean-Baptiste and Marie-Charlotte. Gray Lock's descendants today carry the family name Wawanolet.
Conflicts.
Massachusetts Governor Samuel Shute officially declared war on the Abenaki on July 25, 1722. Shute, who had ongoing political disputes with the Massachusetts assembly, abruptly sailed for England on January 1, 1723, leaving Lieutenant Governor William Dummer to manage Massachusetts involvement in the war.
On August 13, 1723, Gray Lock first entered the war by raiding Northfield, Massachusetts, and four warriors killed two citizens near Northfield. The next day they attacked Joseph Stevens and his four sons in Rutland. Stevens escaped, two boys were killed, and the other two sons were captured. 
On October 9, 1723, Gray Lock struck two small forts near Northfield, inflicting casualties and carrying off one captive. In response, Governor Dummer ordered the construction of Fort Dummer where Brattleboro, Vermont is now. The fort became a major base of operations for scouting and punitive expeditions into Abenaki country. Fort Dummer was present-day Vermont's first permanent European settlement, made under the command of Lieutenant Timothy Dwight. 
On June 18, 1724, Grey Lock attacked a group of men working in a meadow near Hatfield, Massachusetts. Grey Lock retired from the area and killed men at Deerfield, Northfield, and Westfield over the summer. In response to the raids, Dummer ordered more soldiers for Northfield, Brookfield, Deerfield and Sunderland.
On October 11, 1724, seventy Abenakis attacked Fort Dummer and killed 3 or 4 soldiers.
In September 1725, a scouting party of six men was sent out from Fort Dummer. Grey Lock and 14 others ambushed them just west of the Connecticut River, killing two and wounding and capturing three others. One man escaped, while two Indians were killed.

Banganarti

Banganarti is a small village in Sudan, about half way between the third and fourth cataract of the Nile. It is situated from Old Dongola, the capital of Makuria. Banganarti was an important Christian pilgrim center; the remains of a substantial medieval church are near the village (18.166736,30.784785). 
The large church in Banganarti was excavated by a Polish team of archaeologists in 2001. There are two successive church buildings, dating to the seventh century and the eleventh centuries. In the buildings there were several grave systems. The building is decorated with high quality murals. One of the world's oldest images of the Virgin Mary has been found in the Lower Church. Undecorated walls are covered with inscriptions in the Greek language, Old Nubian language or a mixture of both. The inscriptions mention a few so far little Nubian kings and other important persons, such as a queen mother, making them of historic importance. The latest inscriptions date to circa 1350, after which, the church seems to have been abandoned.

Symphony No. 1 (DohnÃ¡nyi)

The Symphony No. 1 in D minor, Op. 9, was completed by ErnÅ DohnÃ¡nyi in 1901, when the composer was 24. Premiered in 1902, it is an early work by DohnÃ¡nyi, and is his first full venture into orchestral writing (the 1896 Symphony in F was neither completed nor published). Although audibly influenced by the prevailing voices of the time, including Bruckner, Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Wagner, Mahler and perhaps most notably Brahms, the work nonetheless demonstrates a formidable handling of complex compositional techniques and is a notable precursor to what would become DohnÃ¡nyi's distinctive neoromantic style. As with most of his public work, DohnÃ¡nyi published the composition under the Germanized version of his name, Ernst von DohnÃ¡nyi. The symphony is 50â55 minutes in duration.
Structure.
The work is structured, uncommonly for DohnÃ¡nyi's time, in five movements. It opens with the customary fast movement; the next three are in a slow-fast-slow configuration, with two calmer movements on either side of a vigorous scherzo. The finale is the work's longest section, and ends in a triumphant conclusion.
The score is marked as follows:
Orchestration.
The symphony is written for an orchestra typical of the late-Romantic era:
Recordings.
There have been two major recordings of this symphony, both in 1998. Matthias Bamert, who had two years earlier conducted the premiere recording of DohnÃ¡nyi's Symphony No. 2, directed a performance with the BBC Philharmonic with Chandos Records label; Leon Botstein conducted the London Philharmonic with Telarc label. The information of the two recordings is as follows:

Lancashire County Council election, 2013

An election to Lancashire County Council took place on 2 May 2013 as part of the United Kingdom local elections, 2013. 84 councillors were elected from single-member electoral divisions by first-past-the-post for a four-year term of office. Electoral divisions were the same as those at the previous election in 2009. Elections were held in all electoral divisions across the present ceremonial county, excepting Blackpool and Blackburn with Darwen which are unitary authorities in a similar way to Greater Manchester and most of Merseyside. The election saw the Conservative Party lose overall control of the council, instead overtaken in number of seats by the Labour Party, without any absolute majority.
All locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.

Siliconâoxygen tetrahedron

A siliconâoxygen tetrahedron is the SiO4 anionic group, or a silicon atom with four surrounding oxygen atoms arranged to define the corners of a tetrahedron. This is a fundamental component of most silicates in the Earth's crust. A variety of silicate minerals can be identified by the way that the tetrahedra links differ, also by the cations present in the mineral.
Siliconâoxygen tetrahedra links.
There are five common siliconâoxygen tetrahedra links:
Independent tetrahedra.
In this group the tetrahedra don't share any oxygen atoms and are independent. Attraction between the tetrahedra and positive ions holds minerals of this structure together. The positive ions could be metal cations such as iron or magnesium. a common mineral in this group is Olivine.
Single chains.
In single-chain silicates, tetrahedra link to form a chain by sharing two oxygen atoms each. A common mineral in this group is Pyroxene
Double chains.
Double-chain silicates occur when tetrahedra form a double chain by sharing two or three oxygen atoms each. Common minerals for this group are Amphiboles.
Sheet silicates.
In this group tetrahedra all share three oxygen atoms each and in turn link to form two-dimensional sheets. This structure does lead to minerals in this group having one strong cleavage plane. Micas fall into this group, both Muscovite and Biotite have very weak layers that can be peeled off in sheets.
Framework silicates.
In a framework silicate, each tetrahedron shares all 4 oxygen atoms with its neighbours, forming a 3D structure. Quartz and Feldspars are in this group.

<doc id="36538692" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36538692" title="Japanese New Left">
Japanese New Left

The in Japan refers to a 1960s Japanese movement that adopted the radical political thought of the Western New Left, breaking from the established Old Left of the Japanese Communist Party and Japan Socialist Party. In the 1970s the Japanese New Left became known for violent internal splits and terrorism, and its influence waned, but it continued to develop new political ideologies such as .
Origins.
In 1956 Nikita Khrushchev secretly denounced Stalinism in his speech "On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences". This speech went unreported in official Party organs, so the Stalinist Japanese Communist Party did not offer any reaction. But copies of it circulated around the world and had a great impact on youth and student Communist organizations. In 1957 the Japan Trotskyist League was founded by young dissidents from the Communist Party such as Kuroda Kan'ichi and Ryu Ota, which quickly split into a Fourth International sect and an "post-Trotskyist, anti-Stalinist" sect called the Revolutionary Communist Party.
In 1958 a Maoist group split from the Communist Party advocating violent revolution. In 1959 the Zengakuren, where the violent radicals had concentrated, broke into the Diet of Japan during discussions of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, eliciting praise from a segment of the Japanese population. It was widely noted that the Old Left had not taken any such extreme measures, and thus the New Left began its ascendance.
1960s.
In 1963 the Revolutionary Communist League split into the Japan Revolutionary Communist League, National Committee (Middle Core Faction) and the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (Revolutionary Marxist Faction). In 1965 the Socialist Party's Youth Alliance developed a that rejected Trotskyism and advocated for Luxemburgism.
In 1968, a global "student power" movement reached Japan, coinciding with the renewal of the US-Japan Mutual Cooperation Treaty. Many of the New Left factions took the opportunity to occupy university buildings, halt classes, and make demands. They regularly battled against police and each other on campus grounds, donning distinctive colored helmets so that they could recognize fellow members.
In 1969, several anarchist groups were revised and formed. In the campus battles these groups wore , along with the "nonaligned" demonstrators, to demonstrate that they would not rally with any particular group.
1970s.
The US-Japan Mutual Cooperation Treaty was successfully renewed in 1970 and students returning to work left the New Left groups virtually deserted, with only career leftists remaining. The groups split into dozens of warring factions and internal violence, which had been occasional up until then, grew ever more severe. One of the factions further radicalized into the infamous United Red Army which killed twelve of its own members in self-criticism sessions. The Japanese Red Army which was responsible for Lod Airport massacre and several airport hijackings also formed in 1971.
From 1969 to 2003, from 1 to 4 people died every year as the result of internal conflict between New Left groups.
Anti-Japaneseism.
One major intellectual current among the New Left was Anti-Japaneseism, which responded to the Old Left's Anti-Japanism. The Anti-Japanism theory posed that Japan's actions since the Meiji period had been tainted by imperialism, and a new regime was needed. Anti-Japaneseism radicalized this argument by claiming that the Japanese themselves are evil and all traces of Japaneseness must be purged from the "Japanese" archipelago. Proponents of this theory believe that the only way to redeem oneself from the "oppressor and criminal Japanese race" is to fight against all Japanese interests. Anti-Japaneseism has been compared to anti-Semitism except that it is argued by members of the ethnic groups themselves.

<doc id="36538842" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36538842" title="Anti-Japaneseism">
Anti-Japaneseism

Background.
The Anti-Japanism theory posed that Japan's actions since the Meiji period had been tainted by imperialism, and a new regime was needed. According to Anti-Japanism, Japan's moral failure can be redeemed if the Imperial family is purged and the country forcibly transitioned to a communist "people's republic". Anti-Japaneseism radicalized this argument by claiming that even communist revolution could not redeem Japan because the Japanese themselves possess an inherent "aggressive nature". Proponents of this theory believe that the only way to redeem oneself from the "oppressor and criminal Japanese race" is to fight against all Japanese interests until the "Japanese" archipelago has been purged of anything Japanese.
Historical thesis.
According to Anti-Japaneseism, the original inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago were anarchist agriculturalists, but were invaded by an equestrian tribe from whom the current imperial family descends. Those who resisted the conquest became burakumin. The suppression continued through the 19th century as the imperial regime conquered the Ryukyuans and Ainu. Thus, the history of Japan is defined as "a history of invasion and exploitation".
Final Solution.
The so-called "final solution" of Anti-Japaneseism is to wipe the nation called "Japan" from the face of the earth and exterminate the Japanese race. Because, as described in the above historical theory, Japan is inherently evil, the continued existence of Japanese people is incompatible with peace. East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front member Yoshimasa Kurosawa affirms that he is not opposed to any particular Japanese political regime, but to the existence of Japan itself.
Strategy for Japanese ruin.
The East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front has suggested a scenario which could lead to the ruin of Japan. They would invade South Korea and topple the current "pro-Japanese" regime, replacing it with a military regime that is openly anti-Japanese. Japan, owing to its naturally aggressive nature, would invade Korea in response, but then the Anti-Japaneseists could employ their terrorist networks to cause havoc in Korea similar to the Vietnam War and drain Japan's financial and political strength, which would facilitate its swift downfall.
Influence on Japanese society.
Since the eclipse of New Left influence this group has been thought of as a bizarre cult. The activist who came up with the name "Anti-Japaneseism" has since left the group and describes it as "Satanic". The journalist Toshinao Sasaki describes life within the group as "insane". The education scholar Akira Moriguchi calls it a "violent ideology" and self-contradictory.
It has been suggested, however, that this ideology has provided the basis for several ongoing leftist protests as well as Aum Shinrikyo's gas attacks.

Daniel Grabauskas

Daniel Anthony Grabauskas (born June 27, 1963) is an American transportation executive and government figure, who is the executive director and CEO of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART).
Early life and education.
Grabauskas was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He is the eldest of four children (sisters Lisa, Karen, and brother David). His father, Drasutis Antanas "Tony" Grabauskas, was a native of Lithuania who emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1949 and died in 2010. His mother, Patricia (Sheehan) Grabauskas-Caruso, is a native of Milbury, Massachusetts. Grabauskas grew up in the Central Massachusetts towns of Sutton and Auburn. He attended St. John's High School, received his BA from the College of the Holy Cross and his MBA from Cornell University's Johnson School of Management.
Early career.
Grabauskas began his government career in 1987 on the staff of Massachusetts State Senator Mary L. Padula (R-Lunenburg) and soon became her chief of staff. After Padula's appointment as Massachusetts Secretary of the Executive Office of Communities and Development (EOCD) in 1991, he briefly worked as chief of staff for State Senator Richard Tisei (R-Wakefield) before joining Padula as a Deputy Secretary of EOCD from 1991 to 1995. He then served as the chief of staff to the Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services. From 1995 to 1996 Grabauskas lived and worked in Lithuania as the resident program officer for the nonprofit International Republican Institute. In 1997 he became chief of staff in the Massachusetts Department of Economic Development. From 1998 to 1999, Grabauskas served as the state's Director of Consumer Affairs under Gov. Paul Cellucci.
Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
From 1999 to 2002, Grabauskas served as Massachusetts' Registrar of Motor Vehicles. At the time of his appointment, the agency was described by the "Boston Globe" as "plagued with long lines and charges of mismanagement" and was considered a political liability after series of articles in the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune detailed the interminable waits at the Registry. During his tenure as Registrar, Grabauskas was able to reduce the average wait time at the agency from an hour and fifteen minutes to less than ten minutes. He also instituted the use of the Q-Matic queuing system, which allows customers to view their estimated wait times on customized tickets or online. In addition, the number of online transaction available to the public was greatly expanded, with online transactions rising from about 30,000 in 1999 to over 500,000 in 2002.
Campaign for State Treasurer.
In January 2002, Grabauskas resigned as Registrar to run for Treasurer of Massachusetts. He defeated Bruce A. Herzfelder in the Republican primary 53% to 47%. He lost in the general election to Democrat Tim Cahill 51% to 41%.
Secretary of Transportation.
After that loss, Governor-elect Mitt Romney named Grabauskas to his cabinet as Secretary of Transportation and Construction. He also served as a member of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority board. During his tenure as Transportation Secretary, the department employed a "fix it first" strategy" which prioritized repairs to existing infrastructure over the construction of new ones. He over saw the introduction of the first state-wide 20-year transportation plan. The plan directed that at least 75 percent of all new capital spending be focused toward maintaining and improving the state's existing transportation network with these funds dedicated to bridge repair, highway reconstruction, de-bottlenecking, intersection and interchange modernization and ensuring a transit system that is in a state of good repair. The plan also included limited transit expansions, prioritizing projects that earn federal dollars, win community support and encourage local contribution.
MBTA General Manager.
In 2005, Grabauskas resigned his position as Transportation Secretary to become General Manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). During his four-plus years as General Manager, the MBTA switched its payment method from tokens to the CharlieCard, construction on the Greenbush Line was completed, and WiFi service was installed on commuter rail trains and boats.
In 2009, the MBTA bought out the remainder of Grabauskas' contract, citing the Authority's continuing financial problems, customer service complaints, and Grabauskas' handling of two subway accidents. Grabauskas' ouster, which was engineered by Governor Deval Patrick and Transportation Secretary James Aloisi, was criticized by the state Republican Party, who believed that the Republican-appointed Grabauskas was being used as a scapegoat. It was also criticized by Democrats Thomas Menino and Steven Baddour, with the latter describing it as "trying to settle a political score at taxpayers' expense".
After his departure, Grabauskas served as a senior fellow for public policy at MassINC and as chairman and senior strategic adviser of the Bronner Center for Transportation Management.
Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation.
In March 2012 Grabauskas was named Executive Director and CEO of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation (HART) after he and the HART board of directors agreed on a three-year contract that includes an annual base salary of $245,000, a $36,000 a year housing allowance, a transportation allowance of $6,000 a year, and a potential $35,000 annual performance bonus. HART oversees the Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project, the largest public works project in the history of the state of Hawaii. The project, scheduled to open in 2019, is a $5.2 billion, 20-mile long automated rail system that plans to operate a fleet of 80 rail cars and an infrastructure of 21 stations, a 43-acre maintenance and storage facility, three park-and-ride lots, and one park-and-ride structure.

Capture of Oaxaca (1812)

The Capture of Oaxaca was a battle during the War of Mexican Independence that occurred on 25 November 1812 at Oaxaca de JuÃ¡rez, Oaxaca. It was fought between the royalist forces loyal to the Spanish crown, commanded by General Antonio PÃ­o GonzÃ¡lez-Saravia Mollinedo, and the Mexican rebels fighting for independence from the Spanish Empire, commanded by JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos y PavÃ³n. The battle resulted in a victory for the Mexican rebels.
Context.
While JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos was in TehuacÃ¡n, Puebla, he discovered that loyalist Spanish troops were en route to attack him. He decided to regroup his forces and abandon TehuacÃ¡n. The organization of the rebel army under Morelos was under the following of his generals; Hermenegildo Galeana, VÃ­ctor Bravo Miguel Bravo, NicolÃ¡s Bravo, Juan Pablo Galeana de los RÃ­os, Mariano Matamoros y Guridi, and his colonels; Vicente RamÃ³n Guerrero SaldaÃ±a (future president of Mexico), and JosÃ© Miguel RamÃ³n Adaucto FernÃ¡ndez y FÃ©lix. All of his forces were able to join together creating an army of over 5,000 soldiers and 40 pieces of artillery. This army proceeded to march to Oaxaca on 10 November 1812.
Before departing for Oaxaca, Morelos named the substitute for Leonardo Bravo who had fallen prisoner to royalist troops. He decided to promote Mariano Matamoros to Bravo's former position, naming him marshal of the army and Morelos' direct second in command, having to take control of insurgent forces in the event of Morelos' capture or killing. After his arrival at Villa de Etla, Oaxaca, Morelos developed a plan to attack the state capital at Oaxaca de Juarez. He sent an ultimatum to the Spanish defender of the city, General GonzÃ¡lez Saravia asking for his immediate surrender. The message went unanswered and Morelos decided to take the city by force.
The Battle.
On 25 November 1812, the insurgent forces took position and began their assault. Colonel Manuel MontaÃ±o marched up the surrounding mountainside to the Cerro de la Soledad to cut the town's water supply and to impede any retreat in that direction by way of Santo Domingo Tehuantepec. General Hermenegildo Galeana took command of the vanguard; Miguel Bravo took command of the center column; Mariano Matamoros y Guridi commanded the rearguard. For his part, Morelos himself commanded a section of cavalry. A good portion of the infantry remained in reserve to be used if necessary later in the battle.
The fort at Cerro de la Soledad, which was at that time in Spanish loyalist control, was able to check the main advance for some time with its artillery cover barrages. Morelos, thinking that his position was unfavorable for attack, sent the colonels RamÃ³n Sesma and Manuel de Mier y TerÃ¡n to take the fort on the mountain. They attempted to move a cannon close to the fort to assist in their attack but soon discovered that they were under heavy fire from two sides and abandoned the gun. Morelos thereafter decided to simply reinforce the main advance by Mier and TerÃ¡n until their objective was at last completed.
Once that position had been taken by the insurgents, the main attack on Oaxaca began supported by an eight-pound cannon. The royalist troops initially returned fire but as the battle progressed, they were unable to sustain the firepower until the town's defender ordered a retreat. The last skirmish, referred to as the "Juego de Pelota" (literally: ball game), was the taking of a fortified position that was surrounded by a moat and trenches. Insurgent forces were initially hesitant to advance on the well fortified position until Guadalupe Victoria hurled his sword across the pit exclaiming - "Â¡va mi espada en prenda, voy por ella!" ("There goes my sword, I will go and get it!"). Swimming across the moat, he incited his comrades to follow him, eventually taking the position successfully.
The loss of Oaxaca was a significant strategic victory for the rebel insurgents and a severe setback for the Viceroyalty of New Spain. For the insurgents, it signified the military prestige and prowess of Morelos as an effective battle commander and gave the insurgents a viable geographic position from which to control the surrounding area.

<doc id="36538955" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36538955" title="Ismail Abu Shanab">
Ismail Abu Shanab

Ismail Abu Shanab (1950-21 August 2003) was one of the founders of Hamas, and one of its three most senior leaders in Gaza. More specifically, he was the second highest leader of Hamas only after Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. He was also the political leader of Hamas, who argued strongly against suicide bombings and in favor of a long-term truce.
Early life and education.
Shanab was born in the central Gaza refugee camp of Nuseirat in 1950. His family was originally from the village of Al Jayyeh, a village near Ashkelon and Yubna. The family was expelled from the village and came the refugee camp in 1948.
He graduated from high school in 1966 and was accepted at then newly opened Bir Zeit University in the West Bank. However, due to the 1967-Arab-Israeli War and Israel's subsequent occupation, he could not attend the university. In 1972, he managed to go to Egypt to receive university education. He obtained a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from Mansoura University in Cairo. After working four years in Gaza city, Shanab went to the US and obtained a master of science degree in civil engineering from Colorado State University.
Career and activities.
Shanab returned to Gaza city in 1977 after completing his undergraduate studies and he worked at the municipal council until 1981. Following the completion of graduate studies in the US Shanab began to work as an instructor in engineering at Gaza Islamic University. During this period, Shanab met with the Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin, Ibrahim Magadmeh and the Islamic Jihad founder Fathi Shiqaqi, and eventually, he joined Hamas. He was imprisoned in 1989 for his involvement in founding Hamas and being a deputy to Ahmed Yassin. On the other hand, Israel press statement argued that Shanab was detained since he had admitted to have participated in planning and carrying out the kidnapping and murder of an Israeli soldier, Ilan Sa'adon. He improved his religious knowledge base during the his time in prison. Shanab was freed in late 1996. After his release, he was elected as the head of the Palestinian Engineers Association on the list of Hamas in 1997. In November 1998, Palestinian police arrested Shanab and other top Hamas leaders, including Mahmoud Al Zahar, Ismail Haniyya and Ahmed Baher. Then Shanab began to serve as Hamas observer in the Central Council of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. He also became one of the spokespersons of the Hamas' political wing in Gaza. However, his role as spokesperson was not ordinary in that he was Hamasâs most visible spokesperson in the western media.
After suicide bombings killed 25 people in Israel in 2001, Palestinian police arrested Shanab and Haniya among the others in December 2001. Shanab participated in the 2002 and 2003 peace talks as a Hamas representative. He also functioned as Hamasâs link to Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas when Abbas was trying to persuade militant groups to stop attacking Israelis. Shanab was one of the supporters of ceasefire declared by armed Palestinian groups including Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 29 June 2003. The ceasefire was unilateral, called "hudna" in Arabic.
Shanab was the third-in-command in Hamas, behind late Abdulaziz Rantisi and Mahmud Zahar and in front of Ismail Haniyeh before his assassination in August 2003.
Views.
Abu Shanab represented the Hamasâs more moderate and pragmatic side, although he was subject to Yassinâs leadership and committed to Hamas ideology. Unlike Yassin, he supported a long-term ceasefire with Israel and a two-state solution. On the other hand, he argued that group decision is better than individual decision, even though the individual is right. Although he did not advocated suicide bombing attacks, he stated that it was a primitive weapon and added "But, itâs all we have and itâs less harmful than F-16s loaded with tons of explosives."
Personal life.
Shanab was married and had nine children, five daughters and four sons. His eldest son Hassan studied computer engineering in the US and his youngest son, Mesk, was two-years-old when Shanab was killed. Son Hamza Abu Shanab (born 1984) heads the Palestinian Assembly for Supporting the Syrian Revolution, a nongovernmental organization. Shanab lived in the community of Eshaikh Radhwan, north of Gaza City.
Assassination.
On 21 August 2003, Shanab and his two bodyguards were hit and killed by an Israeli helicopter missile strike while travelling by car in Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. In the attack, an American made Apache helicopter fired three or four missiles at the car. The assassination occurred in retaliation for the suicide bombing of a Jerusalem bus on 19 August 2003, killing twenty mostly orthodox Jews, including six children. Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement after the assassination and described Shanab as a senior terrorist and Hamas operative.
The major consequence of his assassination was that the three-month ceasefire that had been declared in 29 June 2003 was terminated by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades two days after the assassination, on 23 August 2003. The other consequence was that Hamas continued its suicide attacks that had been stopped for a while.
Funeral.
Nearly 100,000 people attended the funeral cerenomy for Shanab held in Gaza City on 22 August 2003. Ahmed Yassin along with other top Hamas leaders participated in the ceremony in the Omari mosque.

Mount Billy Mitchell (Chugach Mountains)

Mount Billy Mitchell is a prominent peak located in the Chugach Mountains, east of Valdez and west of the Copper River in Alaska. This mountain forms a prominent and easily visible landmark between mile markers 43 and 51 of the Richardson Highway, as the highway passes just to its west between Tonsina and the Thompson Pass (see photograph).
Mount Billy Mitchell was named for William "Billy" Mitchell (18791936), a brigadier general of the United States Army Air Service who is often referred to as the "father of the United States Air Force".
Naming.
In response to the Klondike Gold Rush, the United States Army established numerous military outposts throughout the District of Alaska. As a lieutenant in the United States Army Signal Corps, Mitchell was stationed in Alaska at that time. On May 26, 1900, the United States Congress appropriated $450,000 in order to establish a communications system to connect the many isolated and widely separated U.S. Army outposts and civilian Gold Rush camps in Alaska by telegraph. Along with Captain George C. Brunnell, Lieutenant Mitchell oversaw the construction of what became known as the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS).
Construction of the WAMCATS system began in the summer of 1900. Stretching from Fort Liscum at Valdez in Southcentral Alaska to Fort Egbert at Eagle on the CanadaâUnited States border to Fort St. Michael to Nome on the Seward Peninsula, construction crews completed the final overland connection south of Fairbanks on June 27, 1903. By the time WAMCATS was fully operational in 1904, the system included almost of overland telegraph cable, over of submarine communications cable, and a wireless telegraphy system crossing the Norton Sound to Nome. This telegraph line was the first to link American outposts in Eagle, Valdez and Nome with each other as well as to Washington, D.C. in the contiguous United States. Among the greatest logistical and technological achievements of its day, the WAMCATS included the first successful long-distance radio operation in the world.
A historical marker is located at a roadside highway turnout just north of where the Richardson Highway crosses the Tiekel River. Placed by the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities, the text reads (see photograph): 
Glaciers.
The climate of the Chugach Mountains is strongly influenced by its location close to Prince William Sound and especially the Gulf of Alaska. The Gulf of Alaska generates powerful winter storms which drive heavy precipitation northwards into southern and Southcentral Alaska, including the Chugach Mountains. More snow falls in the vicinity of Valdezâan average annual snowfall of âthan in any other location in the United States. Over thousands of years, this snow has accumulated to form glaciers on Mount Billy Mitchell, especially on its north face, which is its leeward side. Despite this long-term glaciation and even in the face of continuing heavy snowfall (the winter of 2011-2012 saw record snowfall in this area), the rate of ablation has exceeded the rate of accumulation over the past few decades. Because of this, Mount Billy Mitchell's glaciers have retreated significantly in recent years.

Temco D-16

The Temco D-16 is a 1950s twin engine civil aircraft from the United States. It was produced by conversion of a Ryan Navion to replace its single engine with two wing-mounted engines. It is commonly known as the Twin Navion, although that name is also often applied to a later similar conversion, the Camair 480.
Background.
The project began in 1951 as a requirement by Charles Daubenberger for an inexpensive replacement for the corporate Ryan Navion operated by his Dauby Equipment Company, to achieve better reliability while crossing high mountain ranges. He commissioned Roger Keeney of the Acme Aircraft Company to provide a solution, that evolved into a twin engine conversion of a Navion.
Design and development.
Jack Riley Sr. built the first model with a team of four. With encouragement from Lycoming, the 125hp Lycoming O-290 four-cylinder engine was selected for the project. Design changes from the basic Navion structure included strengthened wing spars, that supported engine mounts and other components from Piper PA-18 Super Cub, plus new engine nacelles, a faired nose section that replaced the existing engine and cowling, and a new vertical tail and rudder based on the existing horizontal stabilizer. During testing in 1952, the aircraft was initially named the X-16 Bi-Navion. On 10 November 1952, it was granted certification by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), after which it was renamed as the D-16 Twin Navion.
A second aircraft was converted for Jack Riley, who specified 140hp engines, and he purchased the production rights from Dauby. Riley Aircraft then started production of the Riley D-16 Twin Navion, that standardized the design with 150hp Lycoming O-320 engines and other improvements. In March 1953, after 19 conversions had been carried out, Riley subcontracted production to Temco Aircraft. Temco then purchased the sole production rights, and produced a further 46 conversions under the name Temco D-16. In September 1954, the design was upgraded to include 170hp Lycoming O-340 engines plus increased fuel capacity in wingtip tanks, officially named Temco D-16A but typically marketed as the "Riley 55" for the 1955 model year.
Operational history.
In 1957, after 45 conversions to D-16A specification, production ceased in the face of competition from more cost-effective new-build types such as the Piper PA-23 Apache. Many of the D-16 models were upgraded to D-16A standards. In 2012, about 52 Temco D-16 and D-16A models remain on the US civil aircraft register, and at least three are preserved in museum collections.

Jim Matkin

James G. (Jim) Matkin, Q.C. is a former British Columbia, Canada deputy minister of labour and of intergovernmental relations, former President and CEO of the Business Council of British Columbia, and a former British Columbia Law Society secretary and executive director. He was part of the team which drafted the British Columbia Labour Relations Board legislation in 1973, and he drafted the first human rights code of BC, floated the Non Obstante clause compromise that was adopted in the Canadian Constitution, and is credited with "cleaning up" the Vancouver stock exchange through his one man commission of enquiry.
Early life.
Originally from Alberta, He obtained his bachelor's and master's (law) degrees from University of Alberta and a Master of Laws from Harvard Law School and became a law clerk to a Supreme Court of Canada Justice and an assistant professor
of law at the University of British Columbia.
Professional life.
While a University of British Columbia law faculty member, he was invited to be part of a government-appointed Committee of Special Advisors assembled to draft legislation which became the Labour Code of British Columbia Act of 1973. 
At age 30, he became deputy minister of labor in British Columbia. He was then the youngest deputy minister in the history of BC. From 1981 he was Deputy Minister of Intergovernmental Relations. He left the bureaucracy July 1, 1983 with the congratulations of Honorable Garde Gardom: " Mr. Matkin has performed long and in a most dedicated fashion, under two different administrations, always in the interests of the general public of our province. He's been a dedicated public servant."
Non Obstante Clause.
Matkin's associate, Paul C. Weiler, a former BC Labour Relations Board head, had written a McGill Law Journal paper that recommended a Non Obstante Clause be inserted in the Canadian constitution. This would allow a Canadian province to "opt out" of portions of the new constitution. Matkin's staff altered a "no author text" to include this concept. The "no author text" (or a document with no author named) was circulated at a constitutional conference attended by Canadian first ministers and their staff. This clause bears close resemblance to the Notwithstanding clause that ultimately became an ingredient in the Kitchen Accord among most Canadian provinces and the federal government of Canada.
Later career.
"From 1983-93, he served as President and CEO of the B.C. Business Council..." He was also a director of the Bank of Canada, serving from 1992 to 1995. In 1996 Matkin was chosen to head a commission to oversee the reduction in size of the British Columbia fishing fleet.
Matkin was a committee of one who investigated and in 2004 "denounced" the Vancouver Stock Exchange "as a breeding ground for swindles and laid the blame at the feet of the B.C. Securities Commission".
"...is report served as an official wake-up call. The exchange began blackballing miscreant promoters, then merged with the Alberta Stock Exchange to form the Canadian Venture Exchange, and was later acquired by the more respectable Toronto Stock Exchange, resulting in the TSX Venture Exchange." 
Resignation from BC Law Society.
He was the executive director of the BC Law Society from 1998 to 2004.
On December 6, 2004, Matkin resigned. This came in response to concerns raised at the society that he had become involved with a junior company with two alleged stock offenders. "Matkin denied any improper conduct. He argued that offenders Gujral and Alexander had learned from their mistakes and deserved a second chance. He also said he sought and obtained assurances that Alexander would not promote the company's shares, only the technology." "There has never been any suggestion that Matkin did anything illegal. The issue is simply whether it was appropriate for him to be dealing with a company associated with Gujral and Alexander."
The then-president of the Canadian Bar Association, British Columbia branch, expressed regret that an enquiry did not occur due to Matkin's resignation. "I dare say it would have assisted all to know whether the Executive Director, given the leadership role inherent in this position, is expected to meet an elevated ethical standard, and if so, what that standard entails ... [resignation represents the loss of an important opportunity for the Benchers to articulate, for the profession generally and for the previous and next incumbent, the standards expected of the individual appointed to this key position in the organization." 
The BC Law Society dismissed a complaint of impropriety filed December 31, 2004 by a lawyer.
Legacy.
Matkin's legacy includes the BC Labour Relations board and legislation, changes to the Vancouver Stock Exchange,
and the first human rights code in BC.

They sent an entry to be nominated in the Oscar Foreign-Language Awards. 
Plot.
The film primarily takes place in the rural Malaysian town of Bunohan, which is located close to the Thai border. Adil (Zahiril Adzim) is a young kick-boxer who has fallen deeply into debt, with little hope of paying his creditors honestly. In desperation, Adil agrees to an illegal high-stakes death match at a boxing club on the other side of the border, but in the midst of the fight, with Adil losing badly, his best friend Muski (Amerul Affendi) bursts into the ring and breaks up the match, dragging Adil away. This upsets the promoters of the fight, and Adil and Muski return to Bunohan, where Adil was born and raised. The promoter of the fight sends a hired killer, llham (Faizel Hussein), to find and execute Adil.
Ilham reluctantly goes to Bunohan. It is then revealed that he was born and raised in Bunohan, but left many years ago. Upon returning, memories of loneliness and abandonment flood his mind, and he experiences waves of resentment and regret. As Ilham narrows his focus on his target, he learns that he and the fugitive boxer are actually half-brothers.

2012 Assam violence

In July 2012, violence in the Indian state of Assam broke out with riots between indigenous Bodos and Bengali-speaking Muslims. The first incident was reported to have taken place on 20 July 2012. As of 8 August 2012, 77 people had died and over 400,000 people were taking shelter in 270 relief camps, after being displaced from almost 400 villages. Eleven people have been reported missing.
On 27 July 2012, Assam's Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi blamed the UPA led national government for a "delay in army deployment to riot-hit areas". The next day, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh visited the relief camps in Kokrajhar and called the recent violence a blot on the face of India. Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram visited the state on Monday, 30 July to review the security situation and the relief and rehabilitation measures being taken.
Lok Sabha member from Bodoland, Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmuthiary blamed illegal immigration for the violence in the state. The Election Commissioner of India, H.S. Brahma, said that of the 27 districts in Assam, 11 of them will be shown to have a Muslim majority when the 2011 census figures are published. Singh was criticised for not dealing with the flood of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.
The violence and exodus of thousands of people from Northeast India reportedly led to a series of incessant protests in Assam, at multiple locations, during the months of AugustâSeptember. The protesters' main demand was expeditious detection and deportation of illegal infiltrators from Assam. On 15 September, at a convention of non-political tribal groups, organisations representing Bodo, Dimasa, Tiwa, Deuri, Karbi, Garo, Rabha, Sonowal Kacharis and other tribal communities decided to form a coordination committee for the cause. The tribal leaders said that illegal immigration has threatened the existence, right to land and resources to all indigenous people of the entire state, and it was not limited to Bodoland alone.
Background.
The violence in 2012 followed ethnic tensions between the indigenous Bodo people and Bengali-speaking Muslims. While the Muslim community state that they are descendants of East Bengali Muslims brought to Assam during the British Raj, local communities allege that the Muslim population has increased, boosted by refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan prior to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and by subsequent illegal migrants from Bangladesh.
By the mid-1970s, increased competition for livelihood, land and political power led to frequent incidents of violence, including the Nellie massacre after the controversial 1983 state elections, which left nearly 3,000 dead, and other large scale clashes. These incidents resulted in resentment directed at India's central government, not only from Bodos, Rabhas, Tiwas, and other indigenous tribes-people for failing to prevent illegal migration, but also from the indigenous Assamese Muslim community for failing to protect the rights of minorities.
In 1998, Srinivas Kumar Sinha, who then was governor of Assam, had sent a report to then Indian President, KR Narayanan, explaining about the problems that the unchecked illegal immigration of Bangladeshis would bring to the integrity of India. In that report, he had highlighted the history that Assam was first claimed by Pakistan during 1947 and then by Bangladesh, due to its rich natural resources. The report raised worries about what might happen if the illegal immigrants gain majority and ask for secession from India. He also cited the "Greater Bangladesh project" which might entice the immigrants to merge those regions of Assam with Bangladesh 
Riots in Kokrajhar.
Ethnic tensions between Bodos and Bengali-speaking Muslims escalated into a riot in Kokrajhar on 20 July 2012, when unidentified miscreants killed four Bodo youths at Joypur. This was followed by retaliatory attacks on local Muslims killing two and injuring several of them on the morning of 21 July 2012.
Central government response.
On the request of Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmuthiary, MP of Kokrajhar, the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh called the Chief Minister of Assam, Tarun Gogoi, on 23 July 2012 and instructed him to do whatever was necessary to restore peace. The violence continued despite the efforts of the state law enforcement agencies, and on 24 July 2012, India's central government deployed paramilitary forces and 13 columns of the Indian Army to the affected districts. On the same day, shoot-on-sight orders and an indefinite curfew were enforced across Kokrajhar district, which also led to the death of four people when police fired at violent crowds in the Rampur and Chaparkata areas of Kokrajhar. The Army conducted flag marches and the disrupted rail services were resumed on 25 July 2012, under the protection of the central forces. Union Home Secretary R.K. Singh stated that there were signs of improvement and called upon the Assam government to immediately act against the "ring leaders" of both factions.
On 26 July, an indefinite curfew and the shoot-on-sight orders were enforced in Kokrajhar district, along with a night curfew in Chirang and Dhubri districts. On 26 July, the state's chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, announced the payment of â¹ 600,000 as compensation to the next of kin of the dead. Gogoi also announced that the people who were rendered homeless or displaced would be provided new houses at government expense. The chief minister assured the population that peace would soon return to the violence-affected areas. Singh visited the district of Kokrajhar to observe the situation on 28 July 2012 and offered support to the victims. The prime minister said that the Centre will "closely work with the state government to provide a sense of security to all affected areas to ensure that they can go back to their houses secure in the knowledge that their lives and livelihood are secure". Singh said â¹ 200,000 would be given to the next of kin of those who died and â¹ 50,000 to the injured. He announced â¹ 1Â billion for relief and rehabilitation of the affected people in the six affected districts, â¹ 1Â billion as Special Plan assistance for development programs in the affected areas and another â¹ 1Â billion under the Indira Awaas Yojana. â¹ 30,000 each would be given to those whose houses were totally destroyed, â¹ 20,000 under the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund to those whose houses were partially damaged. The prime minister ordered an inquiry committee to be set up to look into the violence, and directed the state government to provide security so that the affected people can return home. On 28 July, Gogoi said that the late arrival of central forces, including the Army, assisted the spread of clashes in the state. According to the media reports, the Army was initially reluctant to deploy the troops and wanted clarification from the Defence Ministry on deployment because the situation "seemed to have communal overtones". When the situation deteriorated rapidly and another request was made, the ministry authorised Army deployment on 25 July 2012.
The Centre has authorized the Assam government to deploy more than 11,000 paramilitary personnel in the state's violence-hit districts and has dispatched a relief plane with medical teams and supplies. Central paramilitary forces are now out in full force in Assam; the deployment of 65 paramilitary companies has been ordered and 53 companies have reached Assam. Of these, five were sent on the night of 20 July. 7,300 paramilitary personnel were deployed in strife-torn Kokrajhar, Chirang and Dhubri districts after moving them from other states in the wake of clashes between Bodos and Bengali-speaking Muslims.
AIUDF leader Badruddin Ajmal claimed that the state administration was complicit in the violence and demanded a CBI inquiry into the riots.
Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, recommended a CBI probe into the clashes in BTAD and Dubri districts and claimed "internal and external forces were at work".
On 7 August 2012, the Centre ordered CBI probe into the continued ethnic clashes in the state.
According to the Times of India, some 14 Muslim groups which came into existence in the last 20 years are under observation by intelligence agencies after inputs suggested that their activities were "inimical to peace and social harmony". The organizations named are Muslim Security Council of Assam, United Liberation Militia of Assam, Islamic Liberation Army of Assam, Muslim Volunteer Force, Muslim Liberation Army, Muslim Security Force, Islamic Sevak Sangh and Islamic United Reformation Protest of India.
Criticism of the response.
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and some senior Indian officials are said to have questioned whether the deployment of the Indian Army to curb the outbreak of violence was enacted fast enough.
CBI investigation.
On 7 August 2012, the Govt of India ordered CBI probe of the matter. CBI on 19 September 2012, carried out first arrests by arresting five youths in connection with alleged lynching of four former Bodo youths in Kokrajhar area on 20 July.BPPF MLA Pradip Brahma was arrested along with Mohammed Hashem Ali, Mohammed Adom Ali Sheikh, Mohammed Hashim Ali Rehman, Mohammed Qurban Ali Sheikh, Mohammed Imran Hussain. They were arrested after they allegedly confessed of their involvement.
Repercussions in other parts of India.
Pune.
On 8 and 9 August, some Manipuris were attacked in Pune. Students and professionals were beaten up by Muslims in Pune's Kondhwa and Poona College areas. Attackers asked victims which state they belonged to, and those who replied Manipur were beaten. One of the victims said some attackers wore college uniform while others were in casual clothes. Police arrested nine Muslim youths for the attacks.
Mumbai.
On 11 August 2012, a Muslim protest against the riots in Assam and attacks on Muslims in Burma was held at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. The protest was organised by Raza Academy, and was attended by two other groups, Sunni Jamaitul Ulma and Jamate Raza-e-Mustafa. It ended in violence; two were killed and 54 others injured, including 45 policemen. Police Commissioner Arup Patnaik said it was around 3 pm that the crowd turned violent, after some protesters displayed "provocative photos" of the Assam violence. "Some people started raising slogans against the police and media. They set fire to police vehicles," said Patnaik. "As we tried restraining the crowd, a scuffle broke out between the protestors and police." The Mumbai Police Crime Branch suspects that the riot situation outside Azad Maidan was part of a "big conspiracy". Crime Branch sources said the police are probing the alleged role of "outside agencies". Crime Branch officers said the police felt that the violence may have been pre-planned as the protestors were equipped with gear to torch vehicles, which they used to set fire to three media outdoor broadcasting (OB) vans and four police vans, one of which belonged to the riot control police. They also damaged several other vehicles, including BEST buses. At least 30 vehicles were damaged in the incident. The police had to resort to a lathi charge to disperse the crowd. Two of the OB vans belonged to ABP News and P7 news. Eight of the 45 policemen hurt sustained serious head injuries. The police claimed that "at least five woman police constables were molested by mob." There were also reports that a few of the rioters had stolen police weapons and fired in the air and at the police, but no casualties were reported. Some photographers were also reportedly injured during the violence. The police later claimed that provocative pamphlets were distributed during the protest, and they were investigating their source.
The Amar Jawan Jyoti memorial for martyred soldiers in South Mumbai was desecrated during the riot.
The President of the Raza Academy, Alhaj Mohammed Saeed Noori Sahab, said the "miscreants" involved in the violence were not associated with the academy. "Our protest was peaceful," he said. Noori stated that an "irresponsible" speech had been made during the rally, which the Indian Express claimed, exacerbated tensions. Noori said: âThere were several persons on the stage. One irresponsible person made statements regarding the media coverage. He was immediately stopped and attempts were made to calm the situation. We had no idea that this will happen,â he said, condemning the attack on the media.
Riots at Azad Maidan led to panic in the nearby colleges and hospitals. Cama and Albless Hospital and St Xavierâs College went in lock-down mode to prevent rioters from entering their premises.
While condemning the violence caused by rioters, All India Secular Forum social activist Irfan Engineer blamed Raza Academy for being parochial in nature. Engineer said: âThe riots have ruptured the lives of every person in Assam. It has nothing to do with Muslims, Hindus, Bodos or anybody. Raza Academy, while organising the rally, should have taken all measures to see that the crowd does not go out of control or infiltrators take advantage of it or that protest rally just does not become confined for one community and thereby score an advantage in the community itself.â
23 people were arrested on charges of murder and have been remanded to police custody. Raza Academy and Madina Tul Ilm Foundation were booked under section 302 of IPC. Police suspect that Facebook and SMS's were used to mobilise the mob.
The rioters were found carrying sticks, rods and petrol cans to the rally, so police suspect the riot was pre-meditated. They are investigating the source of the weapons. Police have found CCTV footage showing protesters pouring petrol on vehicles before setting them alight.
On 14 August 2012, Bal Thackeray chief of Shiv Sena and editor of Saamna newspaper published an editorial condemning the Congress-ruled Maharastra government for "bowing" before "anti-national" Muslims who went on the rampage in south Mumbai. He compared the violence with the 26/11 terrorist attack on Mumbai.
"While 26/11 happened all of a sudden, Saturday's violence happened right under the nose of the city police. Those who held south Mumbai to ransom are not just miscreants, they are anti-national Muslims. However, it is unfortunate that the police did nothing to control the crisis."
"The office of the police commissioner is barely 100 steps away from the place where the Muslim youths went on the rampage. They took away weapons from policemen, molested women, assaulted innocent citizens and torched public vehicles. Yet the police did nothing. Their bullets turned into chocolates."
A special team of 12 officers from the Crime Branch headed by an assistant commissioner of police will conduct the investigations. Two police rifles stolen by the mob were recovered in Amritnagar, Mumbra, in neighbouring Thane district. Only 19 rounds out of 160 rounds stolen have been recovered so far.
Andhra Pradesh.
Two labourers, Sudip Barman, 23, and Khanin Ray, 32 from Assam were attacked in Andhra Pradesh while traveling on the Ernakulam Express. One of the men sustained severe injuries and later died.
Uttar Pradesh.
On 17 August 2012, Muslim mobs resorted to large scale violence against mediapersons, bystanders, shops, vehicles and tourists in several cities including Lucknow, Kanpur and Allahabad. In Lucknow, after the Friday Namaz, a mob of 500 ravaged various landmarks of the city including Buddha Park, Haathi Park, Shaheed Smarak and Parivartan Chowk, and vandalized many statues including those of Gautam Buddha and Mahavira.
Attacks on people from Northeast and exodus.
In August 2012, 30,000 people from the Northeast region had fled Bangalore after attacks and threats of more attacks to come after Ramadan. Shiyeto from Nagaland, resident of Bangalore, was attacked by a group of people who threatened to kill him if he did not leave the city before Ramadan.
Cities of Pune, Chennai and Hyderabad also witnessed an exodus of people from Northeast. In the national capital Delhi, rumours that people from the Norteast will be targeted, particularly after Ramadan, started circulating.
Union Home Ministry has banned bulk SMS and MMS for 15 days to quell rumours and threats. Railways have introduced two special trains to meet the rush of people.
Singh called for maintaining peace at "any cost". Then Bharatiya Janata Party president Nitin Gadkari blamed illegal migrants for the attacks on people from Northeast. Gadkari said the violent mob in Mumbai had waived a Pakistani flag, made provocative remarks and vandalised the martyrs' memorial. He also condemned the attack on the media present and the assault on women police by the demonstrators at Azad Maidan.
DGP Dinesh Reddy of Andhra Pradesh State, said, "Police have been deployed at all localities with a sizeable North-East population, to boost the community's confidence. Besides, round-the-clock police patrols have been organised."
A policeman at Chennai Egmore station, where Howrah-bound trains from the South make a brief halt, remarked about the exodus: âThe large crowds remind me of the arrival of Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka decades ago.â
On 18 August 2012, Bangalore police arrested three persons for sending SMSs and MMSs, to incite hatred against people from Northeast. Anees Pasha, Thaseem Nawaz and Shahid Salman Khan were arrested, and four mobiles, two computers and one laptop were seized from them. The culprits are believed to have shown clippings of violence in Assam and told a group of Northeast youths that they would face a similar fate if they continued to stay in Bangalore beyond 20 August.
In Coimbatore, police arrested a person identified as B Mohammed Sheik Hassain, for sending more than 200 hate SMSs. According to Hassain, a person named Anvar first sent him the message. Hassain has been charged under the IPC "for threat to national integration and creating public mischief", and under the Copyright Act.
Investigators traced the source of hate messages to Islamist groups such as Popular Front of India, Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, Manita Neeti Pasarai and Karnataka Forum for Dignity. The SMS campaign was designed to create panic among people from Northeast forcing them to flee and to damage the social fabric and economy. The Kerala State Intelligence was asked to check the veracity of the report with respect to the PFI.
Bangalore.
Messages were circulated warning people of Northeastern states of India to leave Bangalore and other cities before Eid al-Fitr (the festival that marks the end of Ramadan) which was on 20 August 2012.
Special events were held by the Muslim community at the Jumma Masjid mosque in Bangalore with all the religious leaders present. An assurance was given by Anwar Sharieff, chairman of the Jumma Masjid Trust Board, to people from Northeast that the rumors spread were baseless.

Fear &amp; Freedom

Fear & Freedom is the third studio album by Australian recording artist Ricki-Lee Coulter, released through EMI Australia on 17Â AugustÂ 2012. The album is Coulter's first release since parting ways with her former record label Shock Records. Coulter had been working on her third album since 2009, under the title "Hear No, See No, Speak No", and was originally due for release in November 2009. However, Coulter cancelled the album's release due to unsuccessful singles. After taking a break from her music career in 2010, Coulter began working on new material for the album in 2011. Unlike her previous albums, "Fear & Freedom" incorporates up-tempo pop genres, ranging from dance-pop, electropop, drum and bass and trance. It also includes themes around love, self-empowerment and emancipation.
Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production and Coulter's vocal performance. "Fear & Freedom" debuted at number seven on the ARIA Albums Chart, becoming the first top ten album of Coulter's solo career. The album was preceded by the lead single "Raining Diamonds", which peaked at number 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. The second single "Do It Like That" peaked at number 13 and was also certified platinum. "Crazy" and "Burn It Down" were released as the third and fourth singles, respectively.
Background and development.
Coulter initially began work on her third studio album in 2009. Originally titled "Hear No, See No, Speak No", Coulter spent three months in Los Angeles and New York recording 40 songs for the album. "Hear No, See No, Speak No" was originally scheduled for release in November 2009, but was later pushed back to January 2010. However, following the two unsuccessful singles "Don't Miss You" and the title track, Coulter told her record label Shock Records to cancel the album's release. She explained, "They label got a lukewarm reaction to the singles they chose to put out, so it made sense not to release the album. I said I'd prefer the album not to go out than to go out and fail. It's my reputation on the line."
Coulter took a break from her music career in 2010 as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. After her contract with Nova ended, Coulter returned to the United States to work on new material for the album. Among those working with her were Billy Mann and Dave Shaw. She also spent time in Europe working on the album. In August 2011, it was revealed that Coulter had parted ways with Shock Records. Upon finding a new record deal, she sent copies of "Raining Diamonds" to several record labels. EMI Australia were impressed with the track and decided to sign her to their label. During an interview with "Nine to Five" in May 2012, Coulter spoke about the album, saying "I'm really excited for people to hear what I've been working on. This is a great pop album, it's full of singles, there's not one song on the album that doesn't have potential to be a single and I'm really proud of that." She also described it as "a very positive album".
On 25 May 2012, Coulter announced that the album would be called "Fear & Freedom". The album cover was revealed on 13Â JulyÂ 2012, showing Coulter striking a pose as a futuristic warrior princess in front of a purple backdrop. She stated that the cover's theme is reflective of the album's message, saying "The album is about unleashing your inner strength, rising above all the thing that ever held you back and being free to do whatever you want to do in life. So the cover has that really epic, empowered and almost superhero-esque feeling about it and I'm so in love with it!."
Composition.
Unlike Coulter's previous albums, "Fear & Freedom" incorporates up-tempo pop genres, ranging from dance-pop, electropop, drum and bass, and trance. The album includes themes around love, self-empowerment and emancipation. The opening track "Human" contains lyrics "about making mistakes and not being Superwoman". Ddegroodt of GloPop compared its melody to Agnes Carlsson's "Release Me" (2008), while Cameron Adams of the "Herald Sun" wrote that it recalls Katy Perry's "Firework" (2010). "Raining Diamonds" is a dance-pop song produced by Billy Mann. Coulter explained that the song is "about being empowered, about not standing for average, about not standing for people treating you bad, not standing for people taking advantage of you, getting out of shitty relationships and valuing yourself enough to say 'I deserve the best'". "Burn It Down" is an "uplifting" electropop song, described by Adams as "a radio-ready club banger bursting with Oprah-style self-empowerment".
"Do It Like That" was described as an "upbeat", "sexy" and "exciting" song, which has been compared by Andrew Tijs of Noise11 to BeyoncÃ©. Ddegroodt wrote that the song revisits Coulter's 2007 single "Can't Touch It". "Crazy" is a drum and bass song, which contains lyrics about "letting the music take over your body and take control, losing your inhibitions and going crazy". Coulter described the song as "sensual and erotic". "On the Floor" contains lyrics about a "cheeky [...] ode of love making on the dance floor", while "I Feel Love" is about "a romantic happy ending". "World Disappears" is a trance song with dark themes. David Lim of Same Same described it as "a stroblit Ibiza-ready cut". Lim also described the final track "Bombshell" as "slow-burning", with lyrics that "reveal the sensual tones of a loved up, confident woman". Adams wrote that the song is similar to ZoÃ« Badwi's "Freefallin" (2010). Nick Bond of the "Star Observer" noted that the CD bonus track "Left to Right" is a nod to Coulter's "R&B-pop roots".
Release and promotion.
"Fear & Freedom" was released through EMI Australia on 17 August 2012, as both digital download and CD formats. Coulter appeared on the breakfast television program "Sunrise" on 25 May 2012 to perform "Do It Like That" and "Burn It Down". She held a one-off show at the Beresford Hotel, Sydney on 30 May 2012, where she performed songs from the album. Snippets of unreleased songs from "Fear & Freedom" were uploaded to Coulter's official YouTube account on 2 August 2012. Coulter promoted the album through live televised performances of "Crazy" on "Australia's Funniest Home Videos" on 18 August 2012, and "Sunrise" on 20 August 2012. Later that month, she toured Westfield shopping centres in Chermside, Miranda, Parramatta, Southland, Whitford City and Carousel, performing songs from "Fear & Freedom" and signing CD copies of the album for fans.
Tour.
In September 2012, Coulter embarked on her Fear & Freedom Tour in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. A fourth show was added to the tour for January 2013.
Singles.
"Raining Diamonds" was released as the album's lead single on 18 October 2011. It peaked at number 19 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 70,000 copies. "Do It Like That" was released as the second single on 23 March 2012. The song peaked at number 13 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was also certified platinum. It also peaked at number seven on the Japan Hot 100 chart. The third single "Crazy" was released on 13 July 2012, which peaked at number 46. "Burn It Down" was released as the album's fourth single on 7 December 2012, and peaked at number 49.
Reception.
Critical response.
"Fear & Freedom" received positive reviews from music critics. Cameron Adams of the "Herald Sun" awarded the album three and a half stars, and wrote that "This sounds like a pop album should in 2012". Adams also highlighted "Raining Diamonds" as the "best moment" on "Fear & Freedom" and summarized the album in one word: "emancipated". Ddegroodt of GloPop praised Coulter for releasing "a faultless, refreshing new pop album which should earn her without a doubt the title of Australia's Pop Queen". She viewed "World Disappears" as the standout track on "Fear & Freedom" and suggested that the song has the potential to be a "global hit". Same Same's David Lim labeled the album as Coulter's "best and strongest body of work to date", and described it as "vibrant, triumphant and genuine". A writer for Take 40 Australia called "Fear & Freedom" Coulter's "most dance-friendly release so far".
Nick Bond of the "Star Observer" wrote that the album "stands head and shoulders above her previous efforts", and that each track has the potential to be a single. A writer for "The Hot Hits" noted that there are several tracks on "Fear & Freedom" that highlight Coulter's "vocal skills", and praised "the party starting tracks that will make you want to hit the dance floor". A writer for the Australian Recording Industry Association called it a "dance-heavy album", and wrote "if you need an album that's a poppy-party-starter this might just be what you're after!". A reviewer for "NW" magazine commented, "If you ever doubted it ["Fear & Freedom"], we'll tell you straight [...] Ricki-Lee is the real deal". Ara Jensen of "The West Australian" wrote that the album features "some of the most self-assured and thumping vocal performances" of Coulter's career. However, Jensen felt that some of the tracks were "a little uncomfortable" to listen to. Jamie Horne of "The Border Mail" described "Fear & Freedom" as "anthemic" and noted it as a "positive pop, mature pop" type of album.
Commercial performance.
"Fear & Freedom" debuted at number seven on the ARIA Albums Chart on 27 August 2012, becoming Coulter's first top ten album on that chart as a solo artist. The following week, the album dropped eighteen spots to number 25 and left the top fifty in its third week.

Giacomo Badoer

Giacomo Badoer (c.1575 â c.1620) was a French-born diplomat, of Venetian parentage, and pupil of Galileo Galilei.
Scientific interests.
Badoer studied mathematics with Galileo in Padua in 1598/9. He later supported Galileo in 1607, in a priority dispute with Baldassare Capra over the invention of a military compass. 
Badoer was one of the correspondents of Paolo Sarpi in Venice, who towards the end of 1608 was making enquiries about the invention in the Netherlands of the telescope. Badoer wrote back in Spring 1609 from Paris to Sarpi with news of the commercial telescopes then being sold; it is said that Galileo heard of the new product via this route, around July 1609. He mentioned Badoer as his source in "Sidereus Nuncius".
Badoer remained close to Galileo, according to Ãlie Diodati, writing around 1620, when Badoer was already dead.
Religion and diplomacy.
By upbringing Badoer was a Huguenot; he became a Catholic convert through the Jesuit Pierre Coton, at some point in the period 1599 to 1603, and by this connection became a diplomat in the service of Henry IV of France. One mission was to Cleves in 1609, at the time of the JÃ¼lich-Cleves War. Sarpi, who in 1609 wrote to Badoer in confiding terms, broke with him around 1610: he then described Badoer as an atheist, and Francesco Castrino of Sarpi's network wrote obscene poems about him (Badoer was a reputed homosexual).

Daniel C. Taylor

Daniel C. Taylor (born June 26, 1945) is an American scholar and practitioner of social change, with notable achievements in community-led conservation and global education.
In the words of Wade Davis, Taylorâs method was shown around Mount Everest in âthe creation of a nature preserve, not administered by distant bureaucrats but protected by the people who dwelt within its boundaries. It was a bold idea, so novel that at every meeting Daniel was able to increase the sizeâ until trans-border protection resulted for the entire Mount Everest and central Himalayan region encompassing an area larger than Switzerland connecting the ecosystems of China and Nepal.
Taylor is Executive Director of Future Generations and Future Generations Graduate School both of which he founded. He has established thirteen nonprofit organizations, twelve still thrive, five are in the US. Since 1993, he has been also a Senior Associate at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
He was knighted Suprabala-Gorkha-Dakshina-Bahu in Nepal in 1990, made the first Honorary Professor of Quantitative Ecology by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1995, and decorated with the Order of the Golden Ark by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands in 2004.
Professional significance.
Bill McKibben encapsulates his work, âThe most interesting development expert Iâve ever met is a West Virginian named Daniel Taylor â¦. His mantra, based on a series of principles called SEED-SCALE, goes like this: Forget big plans. Development is not a product, not a target, not some happy future state â¦ itâs a process, measured not in budgets but in how we invest our human energy.â 
His theoretical work on social change, SEED-SCALE, mentioned above by McKibben, represents a systematic approach to utilize humanityâs most available resource, that of human energy, as the primary force of societal mobilization. The work was launched by then UNICEF Executive Director James P. Grant, resulted in a first major publication in 1995, a second in 2002, and a third in 2012. The basic concept is that âseedsâ of human success exist in every community, even those considered destitute, and from these seeds fitted to local culture, resources, and ecology can be âscaled upâ grown both a rising quality of life and also extension out toward equitable improvement for all.
In education, Taylor explored experiential education during his twenty years leading The Mountain Institute. With Future Generations Graduate School two accredited Masterâs degrees were started that utilize a global campus now extending to 31 countries. With the Green Long March in China, an environmental educational consortium was created with 50 Chinese universities.
In conservation, Taylor pioneered a method for community-based conservation that protects areas first by using political boundaries then within these environmental criteria to create management zones, a less costly, less confrontational approach within the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. In the USA, his efforts integrated private land with public lands near Spruce Knob the summit of West Virginia. 
In the Himalaya, his conservation initiatives include trans-border conservation between China and Nepal with a seven million acre initiative around Mount Everest that he directly spawned both the (Makalu-Barun National Park and adjoining Qomolangma national nature preserve. In eastern Tibet Autonomous Region, he and co-worker Chun-Wuei Su Chien led in working through the regional government the Four Great Rivers Ecosystem Plan (40 million acres that includes the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon plus seven protected areas coupled to land and forest management polices across the upper drainages of the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, and Brahmaputra Rivers). With Su Chien he also led in establishing the Lalu Wetlands National Nature Preserve in Lhasa, at 1,600 acres the largest urban protected area in Asia, now a region completely surrounded by the city of Lhasa. Additionally, he led in setting up a range of community conservation initiatives in Arunachal Pradesh, India.
For the enigmatic maker of mysterious tracks in Himalayan snows, the yeti, after three decades of field research he was able to show âthe abominable snowmanâ to be the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) which in its early life years spends time in trees and develops a âthumb-likeâ digit on its paw that then can make an overprint of hind paw onto front creating a human-looking, bipedal-like snowprint.
Additionally, Taylor has an interest in building innovative physical structuresâa diversity of structures modifying the Mongolian yurt, two homebuilt airplanes (Varieze and Defiant), super-insulated homes and offices, electrical wind generators, and restoration of historic structures from an 1845 gristmill in West Virginia to three monasteries in Tibet.

<doc id="36539669" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36539669" title="Tirit of Armenia">
Tirit of Armenia

Tirit also known as Tirid (flourished 4th century, died 359) was a Prince from the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia.
Tirit was the son born to Artaxias by an unnamed mother, hence his paternal uncle was Arsaces II (Arshak II) who ruled as Roman Client King of Armenia from 350 until 368 and was a grandson to the previous ruling Roman Client Armenian King Tiran (Tigranes VII) who ruled from 339 until 350.
Tirit was most probably born and raised during the reign of Tiran. His father died at an unknown date during the reign of Tiran. Sometime during the reign of his paternal grandfather, the Sassanid King Shapur II launched a war on Rome and her allies, firstly by persecuting the Christians that lived in Persia and Mesopotamia. Shapur IIâs war by capturing these territories began to dealt a severe blow to Roman prestige in the East. Eventually the Sassanid King with his army had invaded Armenia, taking the members of the royal family including Tirit as hostages as they were betrayed to Shapur II by Tiranâs chamberlain. Tirit with all members of his family had become Sassanid political prisoners in which his paternal grandfather was blinded and thrown into prison after Shapur II accused Tiran of collusion with Rome. 
The nobles of Armenia were infuriated by the brutality of Shapur II and his treatment of the Armenian royal family, took up arms and fought against Shapur II and his army with assistance from the Romans. They successfully drove Shapur II and his army out from Armenia. After Shapur II was defeated, he had signed a treaty and Tirit with members of his family were released from prison. As Tiran being depressed and blinded from his experience in captivity, had abdicated his throne and Arsaces II succeeded Tiran as Armenian King in 350. During the reign of Arsaces II, Tirit could have been seen as a potential successor to his uncle. 
Tiritâs paternal cousin Gnel married an Armenian noblewoman called Pharantzem of Siwnikâ (Siunik) from the Siunia Dynasty. Pharantzem was extremely well known for her beauty and modesty. Her reputation for her beauty had become renown and widespread to the point that Tirit had become passionately in love with her and desired her to be his wife.
Finding a way to plot against his cousin Gnel, Tirit approached their uncle Arsaces II and said to him: âGnel wants to rule, and to kill you. All the grandees, the Naxarars and the Azats like Gnel and all the Naxarars of the land prefer his lordship over them than yours. Now they say, âlook and see what you do, king, so that you can save yourselfâ. Believing the words of Tirit, Arsaces II became agitated and did confirm the statements of Tirit.
Arsaces II from then until Gnelâs death had a grudge against Gnel which he had frequently tried to persecute and plot treachery against him for a long time. From that moment Gnel was on the run with his wife from his uncle. Arsaces II did eventually kill Gnel around the time of the festival of Nawasard (which was held in August) as his falsely lured his nephew and his wife into Shahapivan a native camping place of the Arsacids which was below a walled hunting preserve based on a lie that Arsaces II wanted to reconcile with Gnel. When Gnel was captured by Arsaces IIâs soldiers he was taken to a nearby hill of the mountain called Lsin where he was executed. After the death and burial of Gnel, Arsaces II issued an order to mourn the death of his nephew which Arsaces II weep and mourn for Gnel greatly while Pharantzem mourned so much for Gnel she tore off her clothes, was screaming and cried so much.
Now Tirit had successfully got rid of his cousin, he was unable to control his lust for Pharantzem. Tirit had sent his messenger to Pharantzem a note reading: âDo not mourn so much, for I am a better man that he was. I loved you and therefore betrayed him to death, so that I could take you in marriageâ. In her mourning Pharantzem, raised a protest, pulling out her hair and screaming as she mourned that her husband died because of her. 
When the Armenians in particular Arsaces II heard the cries of Pharantzem, Arsaces II began to realise the plotting of Tirit and the senseless death of Gnel. Arsaces II was stunned in what happened and had regretted in killing Gnel. For a while Arsaces II, didnât do anything to Tirit. Tirit had sent a message to Arsaces II stating, âKing, I want you to order that I be allowed to marry Gnelâs wifeâ. As Arsaces II heard this he said: âNow I know for sure that what I have heard is accurate. Gnelâs death occurred for his wifeâ. Arsaces II planned to kill Tirit in return for Gnelâs murder. When Tirit heard this, he was in so much fear for Arsaces II he fled at night. Arsaces II was informed that Tirit had left and ordered his soldiers to find Tirit and kill him. His soldiers found Tirit in the forests in the district of Basen and killed him there.

Tam O'Shaughnessy

Tam Elizabeth O'Shaughnessy (born January 27, 1952) is an American educator, childrenâs science writer, former professional tennis player, and co-founder of the science education company Sally Ride Science. She is currently the Chief Executive Officer of Sally Ride Science.
Early years.
O'Shaughnessy was born in San Andreas, California and attended Troy High School in Fullerton, California, where she was active in tennis. As a junior player, she was coached by tennis great Billie Jean King, who loved helping young players develop their skills, just as she had been helped by others. OâShaughnessy went on to play on the women's professional tennis circuit from 1971 to 1974. She competed in the U.S. National Championships (now known as the U.S. Open) in 1966, 1970, and 1972. Her entry into the 1966 U.S. National Championships at the age of 14 came about by serendipity.
OâShaughnessy was being coached by Dr. Robert Walter Johnson, a physician who played a key role in the tennis careers of Althea Gibson and Arthur Ashe. Johnson was an official of the American Tennis Association (ATA), an organization that promotes tennis for African-Americans but welcomes players of all backgrounds. During the summer of 1966, OâShaughnessy, who is not African-American, competed in ATA tournaments in addition to U.S. Tennis Association junior events. OâShaughnessy won the ATA national 18-and-under championship and so was automatically entered in the U.S. National Championship draw. OâShaughnessy also competed in the 1972 Wimbledon Championships. During her tennis career, she was ranked as high as No. 52 in the world in women's singles on the Womenâs Tennis Association rankings and as high as No. 3 in the U.S. in womenâs doubles (with Ann Lebedeff). OâShaughnessy holds national hard-court doubles titles in the junior division (with Ann Lebedeff) and in the womenâs division (with Pam Austin).
Career and education.
After retiring from tennis, OâShaughnessy was the founding publisher of the Womenâs Tennis Association newsletter for several years before going to college to study biology.
OâShaughnessy earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology from Georgia State University, and a Ph.D. in school psychology from the University of California, Riverside. She was assistant professor of school psychology at Georgia State University from 1998 to 2001, and then associate professor of school psychology at San Diego State University from 2002 until 2007. OâShaughnessyâs research on preventive interventions for children with reading difficulties was continuously funded by the U.S. Department of Education starting in graduate school. She retired early to devote her time and energy to Sally Ride Science, and was named professor emeritus at San Diego State University.
OâShaughnessy has extensive experience cultivating girls' and boys' interest in reading, math, and science. Besides being a former science teacher, she is an award-winning children's science writer. OâShaughnessy began her science writing career in 1990, collaborating with Ride on a childrenâs book, "Voyager: An Adventure to the Edge of the Solar System". OâShaughnessy has written 12 childrenâs science books, including six with Ride. Ride and OâShaughnessyâs clear and eloquent writing style earned them many accolades, including the American Institute of Physics Childrenâs Science Writing Award in 1995 for their second book, "The Third Planet: Exploring the Earth From Space".
As a scientist and educator, OâShaughnessy became deeply concerned about the underrepresentation of women in science and technical professions. Research shows that young girls like science and have the same aptitude for it as boys. But as they enter adolescence, more girls than boys drift away from science, in part because of subtle stereotypes and lack of role models. In 2001, Ride, OâShaughnessy, and three like-minded friends â Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes â cofounded Sally Ride Science with the goal of narrowing the gender gap in science. Their strategy was to create innovative programs and books to keep girls engaged and allow them to envision themselves as scientists and engineers. Sally Ride Science gradually broadened its focus. Today the company strives to spark the interest of all students â girls and boys of all cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds â in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education and careers. OâShaughnessy became Chair of the Board of Directors of Sally Ride Science in January 2013 and Chief Executive Officer in March 2014.
Before becoming Chief Executive Officer, OâShaughnessy served as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President of Content at Sally Ride Science. She helped create the vision for and edited the widely acclaimed series "Cool Careers In Science". The series consists of 12 books, each profiling 12 scientists and engineers working in areas from space science, green chemistry, and physics to math, environmental science, and engineering. The "Cool Careers" books feature female and male scientists of diverse backgrounds who are engaged in active, collaborative work. OâShaughnessy also guided creation of the "Key Concepts in Science" series, which includes 12 books in Physical Science, 12 books in Earth Science, and 12 books in Life Science and the Sally Ride Science Academy brought to you by Exxon Mobil curriculum â teacher training on how to engage students in STEM topics and careers. All of the Sally Ride Science teacher training, science books, STEM career books, and hands-on labs are now available in interactive multimedia versions designed to ignite and build student interest in STEM.
Personal life.
OâShaughnessy was the life partner of astronaut Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, from 1985 until Rideâs death in 2012. OâShaughnessy and Ride also were business partners in Sally Ride Science, and they wrote children's science books together.

Frederick Bradnum

Frederick Bradnum, nicknamed "Freddie" (8 May 1920â25 December 2001), was a British radio dramatist, producer, and director who penned over 70 plays and 140 dramatisations of novels for the BBC. Along with the likes of Tom Mallin, Jennifer Phillips, Peter Tegel, and Elizabeth Troop, and he was considered one of the elite writers for the BBC. 
He was a recipient of the Prix Italia in 1957 for his script for "No Going Home". Bradnum was a member of BBC North's Drama Department, and, according to BBC, Bradnum was "responsible for some of radio's classier adaptations".
Early years.
Bradnum was born in Fulham, though he was brought up in Roehampton. His father was a Battersea power station clerk, and his younger sister required special care, having been paralysed by polio-myelitis. He worked with an architect in the mid-1930s before becoming a council draughtsman. After joining the Army, he served in France (1939), Narvik (1940), Crete (1941), and Saint-Nazaire raid (1942), before transferring into administration with the Special Operations Executive. He reached the rank of acting major. His physical and psychological scars (periods of paranoia; one period of near-breakdown) stayed with him and may be attributed to being tortured by the Nazis.
Career.
A radio producer of drama from 1950 to 1961, he also directed 12 Bernard Shaw plays for the "Third Programme" and numerous plays by Henrik Ibsen. He played a major role, along with Donald McWhinnie and Desmond Briscoe, in establishing the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and wrote "Private Dreams And Public Nightmares" (1957) for it, which was the first radiophonic poem, featuring the voices of young actors Frederick Treves, Joan Sanderson and Andrew Sachs. This was considered an "early example of the experiments blending sounds and voices". In the 1960s, he produced a number of plays for the BBC's anthology drama series "Thirty-Minute Theatre", including several Sherlock Holmes works. He continued to work as a part-time script adviser until 1986. Several of his plays, such as "In at the Kill" and "Minerva Alone", were adapted for theatre and performed by the Hampstead Theatre Club onstage in the early 1960s. "In at the Kill", a one-act play, is described as a "macabre little piece" by "Theatre World". Another radio play, "Goose With Pepper" (1972), similarly was dramatised for the theatre by David Ambrose in August 1975. From the early 1970s to the mid-1990s, he produced mainly for Radio 4. His last play, "The Terraced House", was written for Radio 4 in 1994. In 2003, BBC Radio 7 rebroadcast his 25-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Anthony Powell's "A Dance to the Music of Time", which originally ran during the years 1979-82.
Bradnum was noted for his plays which were often centred around aristocratic folk or esteemed military personnel of the middle and upper class. However, some of his works differed in theme, such as one of his early plays "The Cave and the Grail", which is based on Arthurian legend and set in coastal Norfolk. Keenly aware of his audience, Bradnum knew that northern listeners preferred family plays, northern settings, and adaptations of northern novels, rather than fantasy. The genre of the plays was also broad in scope including "mysteries, thrillers, social and satarical comedies, imaginative fantasies, and complex studies of character and relationships."
Personal life.
He married the Franco-Russian Anne Calonne ("Dada"; d. 1988) in 1951, and adopted her son David. He moved to Hove after his wife's death, and he died in 2001.

Lalla-Roukh

Lalla-Roukh is an "opÃ©ra comique" in two acts composed by FÃ©licien David. The libretto by Michel CarrÃ© and Hippolyte Lucas was based on Thomas Moore's 1817 poem "Lalla Rookh". It was first performed on 12 May 1862 by the OpÃ©ra-Comique at the Salle Favart in Paris. Set in Kashmir and Samarkand, the opera recounts the love story between Nourreddin, the King of Samarkand, and the Mughal princess Lalla-Roukh. Her name means "Tulip-cheeked", a frequent term of endearment in Persian poetry.
Performance history.
"Lalla-Roukh" had its world premiere on 12 May 1862 at the OpÃ©ra-Comique (Salle Favart) in Paris in a double bill with Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny's "Rose et Colas", a one-act "mÃªlÃ©e d'ariettes". The "mise en scÃ¨ne" was by Ernest Mocker, the settings by Jean-Pierre Moynet, Charles Cambon, and Joseph Thierry, and the costumes by Jules Marre. An immediate success with the Paris audiences, "Lalla-Roukh" was very popular in its day, with 100 performances at the OpÃ©ra-Comique in the year following its premiere. It was revived several more times by the company, including performances in 1876, 1885 (with Emma CalvÃ© in the title role), and 1898, receiving its 376th and last performance on 29 May.
The opera was soon presented in other French-language theatres, including those in LiÃ¨ge (20 October 1862), Brussels (27 October 1862), Antwerp (29 October 1862), Geneva (19 January 1864), and other cities, as well as the OpÃ©ra de Monte-Carlo in 1886 and 1888. It was translated into German and performed in cities such as Coburg (25 December 1862), Mainz (26 December 1862), Munich (16 March 1863), Vienna (22 April 1863), and Berlin (Meysels-Theater, 7 August 1865), and even translated into Hungarian (presented in Budapest, 31 January 1863), Polish (Warsaw, 8 March 1866), Swedish (Stockholm, 12 January 1870), Italian (Milan, Teatro RÃ¨, 7 September 1870), and Russian (St. Petersburg, 5 February 1884; Moscow, 10 February 1896).
"Lalla-Roukh" sank into obscurity in the 20th century although individual arias and its overture were occasionally performed at concerts and recitals. Larger extracts from the opera were given concert performances in 1976 at Cadenet (David's birthplace) and in 2008 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. performed by Opera Lafayette.
Synopsis.
Lalla-Roukh, the daughter of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, has been promised in marriage to the King of Samarkand. Accompanied by her confidants, Mirza and a eunuch called Baskir, she departs in a caravan to the King's summer palace for the wedding. As the caravan travels through Kashmir, she is charmed by the nightly songs of Nourreddin, a mysterious poet-singer who has joined the caravan. The couple meet at night and pledge their love to each other. Lalla-Roukh tells him that when they arrive at the palace, she will confess all to the King and refuse to marry him, preferring to live in a simple cottage in Kashmir with her true love.

Alex Jacke

Alex Jacke was born and raised in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, CA. The singer and songwriter realized his passion for music as a child when he fell in love with 90's R&B and Hip Hop. Jackeâs music influences also include soul, funk, gospel, rock, and pop music. Self-taught on the piano, he began composing songs by middle school. By the time he started his freshman year at Morehouse College, he knew music was his future and he focused his energy on songwriting, & performing at school events and venues around Atlanta. During his sophomore year, he appeared on the highly popular MTV series "My Super Sweet 16," as the special guest performer for DJ Spinderella and former NBA player, Kenny Anderson's daughter, Christy. His performance caught the attention of music executive and producer, Laney Stewart, who invited Jacke to work with him over the summer. Jacke jumped at the opportunity to pursue his dream, and left Morehouse College at the end of his junior year to return to Los Angeles. Like others before him, most notably Tricky Stewart and The-Dream. Laney Stewart took Alex Jacke under his wing which led Jacke to land a worldwide publishing deal with Music Gallery/Universal Music Publishing Group in 2011. Along with Stewart and his production team The Sharpshootaz, Alex Jacke spent most of the first half of 2012 perfecting his debut EP, D.F.M. (Dorm Fuckin Music) released on July 9, 2012. On Valentine's Day 2013, Alex released a "Deluxe" version of his D.F.M. release, simply titled "D.F.M. Deluxe."
Music career.
After building a YouTube following doing singing cover songs, in May 2012, Jacke dropped his first single, "One Thing," which was eventually followed with the release of his "D.F.M." EP in July 2012 and then with the further release of "D.F.M. Deluxe" in February 2013. During the summer of 2013, he was selected as a top 5 finalist for Macy's and iHeart Radio's Rising Star contest where he performed at L.A.'s iHeart Radio Festival. He returned again in December 2013 to release a single called "Sex Is Amazing and then again in 2014, releasing another single, "Apart," on March 3, 2014.

Cattle creep

A cattle creep is a small, field-to-field access for farm animals, usually to allow passage beneath an obstacle such as a road, canal, or railway embankment.
Due to the primary users being cattle, or other livestock, cattle creeps usually have a low head height, making them uncomfortable for humans to use.
On Dartmoor, in south west England, the term sheep creep is used to describe a purposefully constructed gap in the base of a drystone wall commonly topped with a granite lintel. The idea was that the gap would allow sheep to pass from field to field but its deliberate size was too small for cattle or ponies to do likewise.

Gaggle is an all-girl alternative choir based in London. They were formed in 2008 and released their first album "From the Mouth of the Cave" in 2012. The group currently has 22 members, each of whom goes by a single-name pseudonym. The main songwriters are Coughlin and her former 586 bandmate, Simon Dempsey.
History.
Gaggle was founded by Deborah Coughlin in 2009. Within months Gaggle received recognition from NME in their "The fifty most forward-thinking people in music", and were featured in the "Evening Standard" as leaders in a movement described as "Choir Mania".
The group released their first single "I Hear Flies" in 2010 on Transgressive Records and won Camden Crawl's Best New Act for the Emerging Talent Awards, sponsored by Gibson.
In 2011 they released a limited EP called "The Brilliant and the Dark" on Record Store Day with a performance at Rough Trade East. This was a reworking of a forgotten 1969 Women's Institute opera found by artists Open Music Archive. Gaggle debuted the new show in 2010 at the Women's Library, then took it to the ICA where the record was recorded live, the B-Side compiled of live samples to be remixed by fans on a copyleft licence. Later in 2011 they took "The Brilliant and the Dark" back to its original home The Royal Albert Hall, in the Elgar Room. This gained the attention of "The Guardian" who described it as "vivacious, visceral, spectacularly indignant wall of sound" in a 4 star review.
In 2012 they released their debut album "From the Mouth of the Cave": two singles of which, "Army of Birds" and "Power of Money", both received videos, respectively. The cost for second single "Power of Money" was Â£3000. The reason for the price was explained thusly:
The Power of Generosity, Inventiveness, Courage. The Power of Flirting, Improvising, Blagging, Hard Work and Being Nice and Polite. The Power of Friendship, Faith, Obligation, Ambition, Anxietyâ¦..Dreams. Without these Powers this track would not have been made. This song is precious. And yet, weâre told that âa singleâ is almost valueless. And that pisses us off. So we have done a budget of how much this single âcostâ. The many hours it took to write, arrange, compose, master; the expertise of all the musicians, technicians, designers, producers involved; the combination of all the Powers described above and more â weâve totted it all up as best we can andâ¦ â¦we are putting this tune to market for the sum of Â£3000. The power of money? Letâs see.
In 2013 Gaggle opened a three-week Pop Up Adventure in Lifestyle, Craft & Noise with gallery, shop and workshops. It took place in at abandoned shop in New Cross. They also released a free app on iTunes.

GOST R Correspondence Certificate

Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation which is also called the Quality Certificate, Safety Certificate of the Customs Certificate appears to be the document that proves that the products or services correspond to law requirements of safety and quality in Russia.
Types.
Now there are two types of Correspondence Certificate in Russia: the GOST certificate of Correspondence to National Standards and the Certificate of Correspondence to a Technical Reglamentation. The explanation of this is as follows: the Technical Reglamentations began being developed and enforced not long ago and that is why they are not able to regulate the Certification Process in Russia in full form. Until the technical Reglamentation replace the GOST Standards, the latest also take part in regulation of the certification process on the Russian territory It should also mentioned proving correspondence to Technical Conditions (TC), but generally this method is used in voluntary certification
The term.
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationmay be given only by an authorized organ in the sphere of certification. The document may be given for the period of 1, 2 or 3 years in the case of series production. If the certificate is given for the party of the products, its term is unlimited. Such type of certification is typical for the parties of foreign products that are delivered into the Russian territory according invoice or a contract.
How to get.
It is possible to receive the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation after providing the documents package to the certification center. One of the necessary documents required for certification is the test protocol. The document may be given by any laboratory authorized for certification tests after testing the products for correspondence to legislative requirements. Generally certification laboratories check the products for environmental and consumer safety as well as they correspond to the claimed characteristics mentioned in technical documentation to the real characteristics.
The schemes of certification.
Scheme 1.
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationmay be drawn up according to the contract. In this case the certificate must contain the date about products tests (the date and the number of the testing protocol). The certificate of this type generally includes the correct name of the Certificate Receiver and the Product Manufacturer, the date and the number of the contract and the scheme of certification. Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationis generally drawn up in the case when the import is not limited by the one-time delivery of the products. After drawing up such document the applicant may import production during a year.
Scheme 2.
The Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation may be drawn up for the party of products. In such case there is no need in drawing up the testing protocol, but the certificate must include the date and the number of invoice. Such kind of certificates is drawn up when importing the test party of some kin of products because it is valid only for a limited party of goods. The Correspondence Certificate is provided with the open date. Generally, this kind of certificate is given, for example, for equipment
Scheme 3.
Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulationfor the serial output of production may be drawn up only after certification tests. It is valid from one to three years. This kind of document may be drawn up by both inner and foreign manufacturer.
The ways of getting Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation.
Manufacturers may get the Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation both obligatory and voluntary. The voluntary Certificate of Conformity to Technical Regulation is drawn up on the yellow blank while the voluntary on â on the blue blank. By the voluntary certification it is the manufacturer who chooses the parameters on which to certificate. That is the reason why the voluntary certification is used by large manufacturers and the trade representatives for proving of the correspondence of their production to the requirements of TÐ¡ as well as to additional GOST standards which are not used by the obligatory certification.

Norway Lutheran Church and Cemetery

The Norway Lutheran Church and Cemetery are located 10 miles south of Denbigh, North Dakota and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1994. The NRHP listing includes the main church structure, a cemetery, and two contributing privies to the west and rear of the church, all situated on a site. A pyramid-shaped monument topped with an iron cross is located at the northeast corner of the cemetery and marks site of an older log church. Norwegian skier Sondre Norheim was buried in the cemetery in 1897.
The church was built in 1907 with sand bricks from the Denbigh Brick Plant. The church was designed in a Late Gothic Revival style with a bell tower that reaches a height of 65 feet from the foundation. It was built on a hill above the Souris River and is visible for miles.
The inclusion of the site on the NRHP was based on its historic integrity, its being "one of the best and well-maintained examples of a rural church" on the North Dakota prairie, and the use of bricks rather than wood in the construction of the church.

Emis Killa

Emiliano Rudolf Giambelli (born November 14, 1989, in Vimercate, Italy), best known as Emis Killa, is an Italian rapper.
Career.
2007-2010: The beginnings.
In 2007, at just 18 years old, he was the winner of an Italian freestyle competition called "TecnichePerfette"
Emis Killa cooperated with the independent company Blocco Recordz with which he published a mixtape, âKeta Musicâ (2009) with original songs and beats of American productions and âChampagne e Spineâ(2010), street album published online done with collaboration of some important Italian hip hop names.
2011-2012:The Flow Clocker vol.1 and L'erba cattiva.
In 2011 he published the mixtape âThe Flow Clocker vol.1.â with his own manager. He signed with Carosello Records, and on December 19, 2011 by digital download he published a new street album âIl Peggioreâ (The Worst). At the same time Emis Killa came out with a new remix of âI Need a Dollarâ by Aloe Blacc, played on many Italian radio stations.
In January 2012 he published the album âLâerba cattivaâ which rose to number 5 on the FIMI chart of the most sold albums in Italy, staying in the top 20 for the 3 next months. Many hip hop Italian artists have collaborated to this album including Fabri Fibra, GuÃ¨ Pequeno, Tormento and Marracash. 16 months after the release of the CD, it came back to the top ten of the most sold CDS, climbing up to number 4.
The music video for his song "Parole di ghiaccio" (Words of Ice), the third track from the album "L'erba cattiva", had received 7.5 million views on YouTube in less than two weeks, 15 million views in less than a month, and 20 million in three months. Breaking the record for Italian music. On 5 May, Emis Killa won 'best emerging artist of 2012' at the TRL awards. On 7 June 2012 he received the golden disc award for his album âLâErba Cattivaâ; whilst his singles âParole di ghiaccioâ and âSe il mondo fosseâ were awarded as the platinum disc in result of 30,000 digital downloads.

In February 2013 he received a nomination during the Kidsâ Choice Award 2013 for the category âMigliore cantante italianoâ (Best Italian singer).
On July 17, 2013 he released the single #Vampiri should anticipate his second studio album, Mercurio, released on October 22. 
At the end of 2013, the rapper takes part in the BET Hip Hop Awards in U.S.A., in Atlanta Civic Center, representing Italy under the bases of one of the best DJs: DJ Premier.
In New York City he filmed his video in the song Straight Rydah also shot in the American television channels.
In BET Hip Hop Awards, Ed Lover has, however, rejected the italian rapper, annoyed by his performance made entirely in italian language, saying: "Were needed the subtitles for the piece of Emis, and that maybe the bars were not even in rhyme. Go back to Italy with this shit. Go to to eat spaghetti, lasagna, pasta... maybe that shit you said likes in Italy ... It takes away from that shit here.Â»
Emis Killa replied saying that he is no one and a racist, sparking a quarrel on the web.
Personal life.
He comes from a modest family: his mother, originally from Palermo, has always worked as a factory worker metalwork, while his father was from Vimercate and he was a musician playing the piano in several bands of Brianza; he also suffered from bipolar disorder and died in 2009 of cardiac arrest.
After gaining the early successes, the rapper moved to Milan, to then return to Vimercate, declaring: "I tried to go to live in Milan, but was short lived and I'm back in Vimercate, the Brianza not let you go: now I'm in the home where I was born and where my father was before separating from my mother.".
Disputes.
With Moreno.
Emis Killa and Moreno Donadoni are certainly among the most popular young rappers of 2010s in the hip-hop made in Italy. Between the two, however, does not seem to run good blood...
In 2009, during the Final battle of Tecniche Perfette (Freestyle battle), Moreno had attacked Emis Killa because he had not voted for him. Emis Killa swears that that episode has forgotten and he said: "We have now made peace, he's nonetheless apologized to me for having that reaction..."
Yet, in spite of the peace, Emis Killa has ruled out a collaboration with Moreno, saying: "He has lost credibility in the eyes of those who represent the world of rap. Working with him I would do a lot of my fans unhappy, because the mass thinks in his own way... "

The Institute is a member of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies â Ireland (CCABÂ âÂ I), a founding member of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and a member of the FÃ©dÃ©ration des Experts Comptables EuropÃ©ens (FEE), the representative organisation for the profession in Europe.
CPA Ireland has headquarters in Dublin and Belfast.
History of CPA Ireland.
The Institute of Certified Public Accountants was founded as the Society of Public Accountants on 29 January 1943.
The first two students sat their CPA exams in 1951 and that number has since grown to over 5000 members and students in 2011.
In 1961 the Society gained legal recognition and changed its name to The Irish Society of Certified Public Accountants Ltd; this was changed again in 1971 to The Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Ireland.
The Institute was invited to join the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies â Ireland in 1991.
CPA Ireland held merger discussions with the 20,000-member Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland in 2001 and again in 2003, but on both occasions the respective Councils of each body decided not to proceed to a vote of members on the issue.
Council of the Institute.
The Council of the Institute is made up of 16 elected members and up to three non-members, including the President and Vice-Presidents of the Institute. The Council meets approximately eight times a year to set policy on areas like the regulation of members in the public interest, the growth and development of the Institute and examination and training standards.
The office-holders for 2014/2015 are:
Qualification.
Students do not need a business or accountancy-related degree to become an accountant; CPA students include school-leavers, mature students and graduates. Previous qualifications may entitle students to exemptions.

There are four stages of examinations with the CPA Institute; Formation 1 and 2 and Professional 1 and 2.
Students must complete three years of training to apply for membership of the CPA. Training can take place in practice, industry or both. Students may first study for the CPA exams and obtain the required training at a later date.
Practice.
CPA Members who wish to engage in public practice must hold a practising certificate, which requires completion of a Practice Orientation Course and examination, and two years' experience in their intended practice area after admission to membership.
Audit.
To be eligible to act as an auditor, CPA members must hold an audit certificate, requiring a practising certificate and an audit qualification. To obtain this, members must have three years' experience supervised by a registered auditor.
Role.
As the Institute is a recognised body, it has a statutory obligation to oversee the professional activities of its members in practice, ensuring that education and training standards are maintained.
"The role of the Institute is to:

<doc id="36540782" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36540782" title="Independent woman">
Independent woman

"Independent woman" is a term explored by various sources in popular culture. Rapper Roxanne ShantÃ©âs 1989 rendition of âIndependent Womanâ highlighted relationships and asked women not to dote on partners who do not reciprocate. Similarly, the definition of an âIndependent Womanâ in the Urban Dictionary is âA woman who pays her own bills, buys her own things, and does not allow a man to affect her stability or self-confidence. She supports herself entirely on her own and is proud to be able to do so.â
Pop & R&B Music.
Kelly Clarkson takes a different stance on the subject in her song âMiss Independent.â She links independence to relationships and the idea that it is very difficult for one to be independent and be in a relationship at the same time. She expresses a fear that many adults-both men and women-have:the loss of independence in exchange for a relationship and family life. Some relationships might warrant this fear because giving up independence can be a natural part of the life cycle. However, independence is often lost as they develop a relationship with a significant other, and they must work together. While her lyrics do a great job of defining independence and exploring the affect it can have on a relationship, she does not present a solution.
Destiny's Childâs 2000 song, âIndependent Womenâ, encourages women to be strong and independent for the sake of their dignity and not for the sake of impressing men. Destiny's Child frowns upon the idea of depending on anyone: âIf youâre gonna brag, make sure itâs your money you flaunt/depend on no one else to give you what you wantâ. The singers claim their independence through their financial stability.
Rap music.
The archetype of the "independent woman" is particularly emphasized today in the hip- hop genre in which male and female rappers discuss it frequently. Moody, Professor of Journalism at Baylor University described the "independent black woman" phenomenon in two 2011 articles titled "A rhetorical analysis of the meaning of the 'independent woman'" and the "The meaning of 'Independent Woman' in music".
The articles indicated that the lyrics and videos of male and female rappers portrayed "independent women" differently. Using the concept of intersectionality, Moody's rhetorical analysis combined feminist and critical cultural theories to explore the meanings of the 'independent woman' in the lyrics and respective videos of male and female rappers. She concluded that songs by various artists, corresponding music videos, and viewer comments contained four main messages: wealth equals independence, beauty and independence are connected, average men deserve perfect women, and sexual prowess equals independence. Male rappers were more likely to include messages of beautiful, overachieving women paired with average men, while female rappers focus on their own sexual prowess.

Perris Depot

The Perris Depot is a railroad depot built in 1892 to serve Perris, California. The station replaced a previous wooden structure at the same site on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway line, originally the California Southern Railroad. 
History.
The station was built by J.W. Nance, a Perris developer, and was designed by Benjamin Franklin Levet, Sr., son-in-law to Fred T. Perris. The depot served both passenger traffic and the considerable agricultural traffic associated with the farmlands of the Perris Valley. However, passenger traffic declined and ended in 1947. Agriculture declined due to limited water supplies and salinization, and farms were replaced with suburbs. All but one track in the station yard was abandoned in 1975. From 1974 the depot has been used by the Perris Valley Historical and Museum Association as a museum of local history. In the 1990s the depot was proposed as a commuter rail station.
Description.
The red brick depot is in the Queen Anne style, with a conical-roofed turret, round windows and an arched entry. The depot is a one-story structure, generally rectangular in plan, with a raised central mass at right angles to the plan with flanking wings. The central mass features an arched entry on one side and a projecting round bay with a cupola opposite. The brick gables are partly hipped, with prominent "PERRIS" signs on each. A comb-like finial decorates the ridge of the central roof mass and wings, with "SANTA FE" signs facing either platform.
Present use.
The Perris Depot is used by the Orange Empire Railway Museum as a terminus for its excursion train line. The depot was renovated in 2007-2008. The Perris Multimodal Transit Center was opened in 2010 adjacent to the depot, with bus and Metrolink train service. The Metrolink line extension through Perris is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. The museum continues to operate in the depot. 
The depot was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 1994.

Meekatharra â Wiluna railway

The Meekatharra to Wiluna railway was a branch line of the Western Australian Government Railways that extended the Mullewa â Meekatharra railway from Meekatharra to Wiluna. Wiluna was the furthest rail terminus from Perth on the Western Australian Government Railways system. 
Overview.
Construction began in the late 1920s, and the line operated between 1932 and 1957, mainly serving the Wiluna gold mining area.
However Wiluna was also at the end of the Canning Stock Route from Halls Creek in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, and so the railway became a vital means of dispatching cattle intended for southern markets. 
The track was susceptible to washaways.

Manzoor Ul Haq Siddiqi

Manzoor Ul Haq Siddiqi (Urdu:ÙÙØ·ÙØ±Ø§ÙØ­Ù ØµØ¯ÛÙÛ; April 12, 1917Â â July 27, 2004) was a professor, activist, historian and an active supporter of Pakistan Movement. An associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and a paramount figure in the establishment of Pakistan. He served as a professor of Mathematics and Urdu in Cadet College Hasan Abdal (1954â1980) and was among the founding teachers of the institute. Due to his integral and phenomenal role in the establishment of Pakistan he was awarded Tehreek-e-Pakistan Gold medal by Government of the Punjab.
In retirement, Siddiqi's work authoring several books and educating youngsters for different boarding institutes of Pakistan was distinguished. He suffered a debilitating paralysis stroke on July 24, 2001, and died on July 27, 2004 at the age of 87.
Background.
M.H.Siddiqi's ancestors migrated to India during the rule of Qazi Qawam-ud-din. During the rule of Tughlaq and Mughals, many of his patriarchs were appointed on higher and honorable designations. In 1857, during the Indian Rebellion, many of his antecedents were arrested and hanged for treason and their properties were confiscated by the British because of taking part in the war against them. Siddiqi mentioned about all the history of these incidents in his book "Maatherul Ajdad". His family was known for converting the Rajput's of Haryana to Muslims.
Early life.
Siddiqi was born to IzharUllah Siddiqi and Amtul Begum on April 12, 1917 to a middle-class family in Rohtak district, India. He had two brothers: Talibullah and Shifaullah and one sister. Siddiqi completed his Masters in Arts from Punjab University and displayed prodigious talent in studies as well as in sports. Later on in 1937,he joined "Punjab Muslim Students Federation" and became a prominent figure. He attended the Lahore Resolution in 1940 and in 1941, and was among the key activists of Jinnah in "Pakistan Conference" by playing an important role under his leadership. He migrated with his family from Rohtak, India to Rawalpindi Pakistan after partition of subcontinent.
Political career and influence of Jinnah.
Siddiqi had been a firm supporter of Jinnah in the Pakistan Movement. He worked side by side of Jinnah and was a member of the welcome committee of "Pakistan conference" which was held on March 21, 1941. In the second Muslim Student Federation rally, which was held on March 8, 1942 in Rawalpindi, Siddiqi conducted the whole rally and was the president of the Welcome Committee. He took full responsibility of the rally and during this rally he introduced a new pamphlet of "Live and Let Live". This was the rally in which Muslim Student Federation was officially welcomed in Qarardad-e-Pakistan. He was also one of the 8 members of "Special Pakistan conference" whose soul purpose was to educate the Muslims living in the villages. He was also a member of the "Pakistan Rural Propaganda Committee". This committee played a major role in establishing new branches of Muslim League in the Punjab and was among the leading parties in the rebellion against "Khizar Wazarat" in Punjab. During his visit to Rohtak, Siddiqi officially started the propaganda. During the same month, Jinnah requested Punjab's Chief Minister Sir Sikandar Hayat and other employees of Muslim League to resign from the Viceroy's National Defense Council for which the "Pakistan Rural Propaganda Committee" made major arrangements for the rally. This rally continued till the resignation of Sir Sikandar Hayat. 
Muhammad Ali Jinnah, visited Rawalpindi only once during his lifetime and that was on the invitation of then young student leader Manzoor ul Haq Siddiqui in 1945.
Teaching career.
After the establishment of Pakistan, Siddiqi stopped working in the political parties and instead started working for the education sector of Pakistan. In 1954, he joined Cadet College Hasan Abdal and was among the founding teachers of the college. He served as the housemaster of Haider and Auragnzeb wing during his tenure. He was also the coach of Hasanabdal's college football team. He used to teach mathematics and Urdu during his 26 years of stay in the college. He retired from Cadet College in 1980. After his retirement, he started coaching prospective students for different boarding institutions of Pakistan and was considered to be a role model for the teachers of such boarding institutes. His contributions in the field of literature and education were acknowledged and then President General Zia ul Haq awarded him with the Presidential Gold Medal.
Personal life.
Siddiqi married Sarwar Siddiqah in 1945. They have three daughters, and two sons, Ahmad Mansoor (1946) and Ahmad Riza (1950). His son Arshad Mahmood (1948) died in a plane crash in 1970 when he was traveling from Rawalpindi to Lahore. His plane crashed near Rawat. Siddiqi was deeply hurt by the loss of his son during the tragic accident. Later on he wrote a book on Arhsad Mehmood named as "Namune Ka Aik Naujawan". Personal Library of Manzoor Ul Haq Siddiqui was acknowledged as one of the great libraries in Pakistan as per the Libraries of the World published by UNICEF (Volume VIII), his library was the only private library recognized in Provence of Punjab. However, Siddiqi donated entire books and documents to Archives of Govt of Pakistan a few years before. Many of his thesis and columns are present in Urdu Dairah Muarif Islamia Many of the letters sent to his forefathers by Tughlaq's and Mughals were in his personal collection which, after his paralysis, were donated to the National Archives of Pakistan by his son Ahmad Riza with the intention of the national heritage being preserved for the future generations.
Death and legacy.
On July 24, 2001, a rain storm wrecked everything in its path in Rawalpindi. Siddiqi suffered a severe stroke of paralysis on July 24, 2001, while he was at his son's house in Rawalpindi. He was taken to Central Military Hospital (CMH) in Rawalpindi, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg. After staying in paralysis for nearly three years, he slipped into a deep coma on the morning of July 27, 2004 and died in the evening on the same day, with his son Ahmad Riza at his bedside. He was 87 years old. Siddiqi's funeral took place on July 28, 2004. Siddiqi was also remembered by his students and colleagues, many of whom continued to dedicate their international research and publications to his memory.
Manzoor-ul-Haq Siddiqi rests in the Army Grave Yard in Rawalpindi Cantt where his wife is also buried. He was survived by his three daughters and two sons.

N-Methylserotonin

"N"-Methylserotonin is a tryptamine alkaloid. Chemically, it is a derivative of serotonin in which a methyl group resides at its alkyl amine. It is also called "N"Ï-methylserotonin ("N"Ï-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine) to distinguish it from tryptamine-derived compounds in which a methyl group is bonded to the nitrogen atom of the indole group.
"N"-Methylserotonin is found in plants, animals, and fungi. These include the plants, "Actaea racemosa" (black cohosh) and "Zanthoxylum piperitum", the Green and Golden Bell Frog, "Litoria aurea", and "Amanita" mushrooms. The compound binds to several serotonin receptors, including the 5-HT7 and 5-HT1A receptors, with high affinity (IC50 â¤ 2 nM) and selectivity, and displays agonist activity; besides its direct interaction with the serotonin receptors, "N"-methylserotonin also acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

Pinnox branch

The Pinnox railway branch ran from Longport Junction, north of Longport Station, through to just south of Tunstall Station in England.
The Pinnox branch was originally constructed as a mineral line between Longport and Tunstall. The line after leaving the main line at Longport Junction ran past Westport Lake on an embankment before passing under Davenport Road and Westport Road. The branch passed the side of what is now Co-operative Academy at Brownhill. The junction with the Potteries Loop Line was at Pinnox Junction, Tunstall

Ri Sol-ju

Ri Sol-ju or Lee Seol Ju (; born January 1985 â 1989) is the wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. North Korean state media has officially identified her as "his wife, Comrade Ri Sol Ju".
Biography.
North Korea is secretive about Kim Jong-un and his family. Very little information about Ri Sol-ju has appeared in official North Korean sources, but more speculative information has been reported in foreign media.
Known.
In 2012, Ri made several public appearances standing next to the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, causing speculation about who she might be. South Korean intelligence officials tentatively identified her as Hyon Song-wol, a former singer for the Pochonbo Electronic Ensemble, a musical group popular in North Korea. However, on 25 July 2012, North Korean state media announced that she was actually Kim's wife, saying she was "his wife, Comrade Ri Sol Ju".
In July 2012, at an elite gala concert in North Korea, Ri was stylishly "dressed in a trim black suit in the Chanel tradition", considered unusual for North Korean women who normally dressed conservatively in billowing dresses or Mao-style work clothes. Along with other recent changes such as the firing of a hard-line top general, Kim Jong-un's marriage is seen by analysts as "a continuation of what is either a policy change, or a propaganda offensive, or both."
Kenji Fujimoto, the former personal sushi chef of Kim Jong-il, said he met Ri on a recent trip to North Korea. He described her as "just so charming ... I cannot describe her voice, it's so soft ..." As a parting gift, Ri gave Fujimoto a Christian Dior hand bag, which Ri was earlier reported to have.
Reported.
Very little is known for certain about Ri; some analysts have even said her name "almost certainly is a pseudonym". Various security analysts, politicians, media and others have made public claims about her that have not been officially confirmed in North Korean media.
Ri's reported year of birth has ranged between 1985 and 1989 among various sources. Ri's family is reportedly from the political elite; her mother is the head of a gynecology ward and her father is a professor. She is said to have graduated from Geumsung 2 Middle School in Pyongyang and studied abroad in China majoring in vocal music. JoongAng Ilbo and some commentators have identified Ri Sol-ju as a singer in the Unhasu Orchestra that has made several overseas performances. Reportedly, North Korean officials are "trying to erase her past as a singer and entertainer by confiscating popular bootleg CDs of her performances", such as her singing the song "Sobaeksu". She is reportedly a graduate student at Kim Il-sung University, pursuing a PhD in science.
She reportedly visited South Korea, in 2005, as a member of the North Korean cheerleading team during the Asian Athletics Championships. She was said to be among 90 cheerleaders who chanted "We are one!" Ri reportedly told a South Korean teacher while on the trip, "We want to take classes from the South's teachers after being reunited as soon as possible."
The BBC, quoting an analyst who spoke to "The Korea Times" of South Korea, reported that Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, had hastily arranged his son's marriage after suffering a stroke in 2008. The two were reportedly married in 2009 and Ri possibly gave birth to a child in 2010.
Pregnancy and motherhood.
In October 2012, there was speculation about Ri's public disappearance, and questions arose whether it was the result of a "breach of discipline" or "pregnancy," but she later reappeared with her spouse Kim at a military college. It was followed by news reports in December 2012 that Ri was visibly pregnant, although North Korean officials did not comment on the speculation.
In March 2013, former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman visited Kim Jong-un in North Korea and on his return told the British tabloid newspaper the "Sun" that Ri had given birth to a healthy daughter. One South Korean government source speculated that "doctors induced labor to make sure the child was born in 2012, which marked the 100th anniversary of North Korean founder Kim Il-sung," but no exact birth date has been confirmed. Rodman told "The Guardian" in September 2013 that the couple's baby, a girl, is named Ju-ae.
Social media and international effect.
Several "major news sources have continued to turn out speculation about the woman who is seen as an elusive East Asian celebrity." There is no evidence that any of Ri Sol-ju's Facebook pages are her official Facebook page.
According to social media analysis service Pulse K (íì¤K) and the South Korean PR firm Medicom (ë¯¸ëì»´) from 25 July 2012 to 15 August 2012, "the total number of tweets during this period skyrocketed to 21,329" about Ri. "There were about 2,000 more tweets including the words "North Korea" and "Kim Jong-un" on the day she was revealed to be the leader's wife than on the day of a major announcement by Leader Kim on July 18." On 18 July 2013, tweets about North Korea numbered 15,653 and tweets about Kim Jong-un numbered 11,231. On 26 July, tweets about North Korea hit 17,004 and tweets about Kim Jong-un reached 13,283."
However, there is a distinct difference in style between the South Korean Twitterverse and the English-language social media dealing with Ri Sol-ju. According to Darcie Draudt, the "media discourse about Ri Sol-ju does reveals some important ideas worth considering, including international and peninsular attitude toward the North Korean elite." On one hand, the South Koreans "praise her beauty and modern style but also remain sceptical" because of social and economic corruption and the English-speaking audiences "see her as a fashionable doll of the North Korean regime." Draudt argues "internet-based discourse of her reveals more about the people making the constructions."

Franciscans of primitive observance

The Franciscans of Primitive Observance, or "FPOs" as they are commonly called, are a Roman Catholic group that lives a strict observance of the Rule of St. Francis. They are based in Boston, Massachusetts and are erected as a Lay Association of the Faithful under the Cardinal Archbishop of Boston.
Founding.
The Franciscans of Primitive Observance were founded by six members of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal who were seeking a more strict observance of the life and rule of St. Francis. These six friars reached out to then Bishop SÃ©an O'Malley of the Diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts, himself a Capuchin Franciscan. O'Malley agreed to host the new group, and assisted them in writing their rule and constitutions.
History.
The FPOs opened a friary in New Bedford, MA initially, consisting of the original six friars. Subsequent houses were opened in Beford, VT; Emmitsburg, MD; and Nicaragua, Central America.
With the ascension of O'Malley to the archbishopric of Boston, the FPOs requested to be incardinated in the Archdiocese and opened a friary in Lawrence. The friary in New Bedford was closed at this time.
The membership of the friars has fluctuated over time, peaking at about fifteen brothers including novices and postulants.
Form of Life.
The Franciscans of Primitive Observance live a strict observance of the Rule of St. Francis. They do not carry money, and rely on the donations of individuals to pay for their needs. In their houses they do not utilize modern appliances (televisions, radios, refrigerators, washing machines) whenever possible. FPO brothers called "questors" seek food door-to-door in the neighborhoods in which they live.
The FPOs live a mixed contemplative and active life, spending considerable time in prayer each day in the chapel, as well as time in the community.
The FPOs do not wish that details of their penetential life be widely known, living by the Lord's admonition to "pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly" (Matthew 6:6).
Controversy.
The FPO live a strict form of life, and are very dedicated to defending their Catholic faith, and so have experienced some friction as a result.

Robert Field (painter)

Robert Field (1769â1819) was a painter who was born in London, England, and died in Kingston, Jamaica. He was one of Americaâs leading miniaturists. Along with being the most important painter in Nova Scotia at the beginning of the 19th century, at this time, Field was probably the most professionally trained painter to settle in Canada. Daphne Foskett in "A Dictionary of British Miniature Painters" (1972) wrote that Field was, "one of the best American miniaturists of his time." He worked in the conventional neo-classic portrait style of Henry Raeburn and Gilbert Stuart. His most famous works are two groups of miniatures of George Washington, commissioned by his wife Martha Washington. (Field's miniatures of both are in the Yale University Art Gallery permanent collection.)
America.
He received his early training at the Royal Academy schools, London, in 1790. In 1794 he moved to the United States. He took up residence in the nation's then-capital, Philadelphia, Pa. There he immediately joined a group of artists led by Charles Willson Peale in establishing the Columbianum, or American Academy of the Fine Arts, which was eventually superseded by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 1805.
Field spent 14 years in the United States, working as a miniature painter in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, and Boston; during this period he produced miniatures of George and Martha Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and a wide range of people prominent in the social, economic, and political life of American society. According to historian Harry Piers, Field was one of the four most highly sought American miniaturists in his time. Martha Washington herself commissioned Field in 1800 to paint a group of miniature as mementoes for friends and family, to commemorate the revered General and President on the one-year anniversary of his death. Two groups of miniatures of George Washington were produced by Field at Martha's request in late 1800, the first group showing him in civilian dress, the second as general in full uniform.
Nova Scotia.
When tensions between America and England started to rise in the lead up to the War of 1812, Field remained a loyalist and moved from Boston to Halifax, Nova Scotia (1808). He continued to produce miniatures, but he also painted more than 50 oil portraits of government officials, military officers, merchants, and assorted members of the Halifax "gentility"; among his subjects were Bishop Charles Inglis, former lieutenant governor Sir John Wentworth, Sir George Prevost, Sir John Coape Sherbrooke, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Provo William Parry Wallis, and Sir Alexander Forrester Inglis Cochrane, vice-admiral in the Royal Navy (whose portrait was shown at the Royal Academy exhibition in London in 1810).
Jamaica.
In 1816 he moved to Jamaica, settling first in Montego Bay and then in Kingston. He died on 9 August 1819, apparently of yellow fever, and was buried in an unmarked grave in the old "West Ground" cemetery, now called the Strangers' Burial Ground, near the Kingston parish church.

Agro-town

An agro-town is an agglomeration located in a rural environment with a population sometimes several thousands-strong but whose workforce's main occupation is agriculture. The agro-town also lacks the administrative, commercial and industrial functions which are usually common in the centers of such size. This type of agglomeration is particularly present around the Mediterranean Sea, in West Africa and in the Americas.
Structure.
The population of agro-towns are commonly very poor, most workers do not own the land and are employed seasonally as wage labour. This also explains why these populations are often very fluctuent with a large immigration during harvest and a significant emigration during the low season or in case of crises. The concentration of the land into the hands of a small elite of often absentee landlords commonly leads to tensions within the towns leading in the 20th century to a prevalence of the communist vote in many agro-towns on Mediterranean Europe.
Large landlords are typically absent and leave the management of their estate to some agents who seldom lives in the town but rather in large and prosperous farmhouses in the countryside (known as masia). On the other hand, landless wage labourer often had to travel large distances to reach the location of their employer. Despite the relative plenty of labour, the surrounding exploitations tend to concentrate in non-labour intensive cultures due to the supervision issue that arise with large labour forces. Consequently latifundia tend to specialize in capital-intensive cash crops which often require the edification of large specialized buildings such as windmills or oil presses.
Environmental causes.
The origin of such a peculiar and somewhat counter-intuitive type of agglomeration has led to a lot of speculation regarding their origin. Among the main theories regarding their emergence, the most common are related to their environment. Agro-towns being prevalent in warm environments, it's been pointed out that they tended to emerge where water was rare and the population had to cluster around a well. Another factor that is commonly mentioned to explain the rise of agro-towns is the higher salubrity of the site of the agglomeration. The prevalence of malaria in wetlands implied that it was healthier to live in higher ground which may have led to a concentration of the population on some hills. Incidentally, higher ground and concentrated habitat also provide good defensive positions which may have played a role in regions were marauders and pirates were a threat to isolated farms.
Economic causes.
Daniel Curtis has pointed out that in some regions agro-towns were located close to more spread habitats and that consequently environmental causes could not alone explain the emergence of agro-towns. He noted a historical evolution which led to the concentration of the population into a few urban centers. In this view, small farmers were gradually driven off their land by larger landowners and had to seek refuge in towns where they became wage labourer for those same large landowners. This process would explain why agro-towns are mostly located in regions dominated by latifundia and high level of tension between the town residents and the landlords. As the most fertile lands are the most likely to attract large investors, agro-towns may be seen as a version of the resource curse as more productive lands lead to a high level of misery among the population.

Joseph Abbeel (Vrasene 1786 - Anzegem 1866) was a Belgian soldier who was conscripted to the French Army of Napoleon Bonaparte. In the position of a carabinier he witnessed the French Invasion of Russia in 1812.
He is one of the few who survived the devastating horror of the raid on Moscow and the chaotic retreat that followed it. He was wounded at the battle of Borodino. He saw Moscow burn, followed the retreating French Army, but was captured by cossacks in the vicinity of Hamburg. It was only in 1815 that he came home. He never married. It is assumed that he became a school teacher.
He wrote down his memories almost immediately, but never published them. They were rediscovered and edited two centuries later. This, together with Jakob Walter's diary, form the only known records of that campaign kept by common soldiers. Abbeel's story contains some minor historical mistakes, mostly due to his lack of geographical knowledge. But the authenticity of the manuscript is undisputed.

Angels (The xx song)

"Angels" is a song by English indie pop group The xx, released as a digital download on 17 July 2012 by Young Turks. It was the lead single for their 2012 album "Coexist". The song was written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft, bassist Oliver Sim, and percussionist Jamie xx, who also produced it.
The xx premiered the song on 14 May 2012 at their first live show since touring in 2010. Upon its release, "Angels" received positive reviews from music critics, who commended Croft's performance and the song's minimalist musical style. The song was remixed by electronic musician Four Tet, whose version was aired on BBC Radio on 19 September.
Writing and recording.
"Angels" was recorded during the sessions for "Coexist" at The xx's recording studio in London. Its demo was originally recorded solely by Romy Madley Croft, who wrote the song's lyrics. Jamie xx said of the song's recording in an interview for "Spin", "It took a while to work out how to arrange it for the band. The demo was quite perfect, but it was just Romy. It took the entire length of the recording process to get it right."
Composition.
"Angels" is a sparsely-produced, gentle ballad about the idea of being in love. It has a measured pace and features slight vocals and whispered cadences by Croft, background baritone bass, subtle drum thuds, and coiling guitar lines. Pitchfork Media's Larry Fitzmaurice observes on the song "lots of hollow space surrounding add[s intimacy." "Angels" opens with echoey guitar and Romy's vocals, which are at the front of the mix. Eerie snare rolls appear within a minute of the song, but quickly fade away. Arnold Pan of PopMatters writes that, in the context of "Coexist", the song has its "own sense of development" and "resolution". Oliver Sim said of this moment of tension in the song, "Early on, Jamie said something about the album being inspired by dance music, so everyone's expecting a house beat to drop halfway throughâwhich is hilarious because this is not a dance record."
Croft's transparent lyrics express lovesick emotion, adoration, and private knowledge acquired from intimacy: "You move through the room / Like breathing was easy / If someone believed me / They would be as in love with you as I am". They also compare a relationship that ended prematurely to "dreaming of angels, and leaving without them". Her repetition of "love" in the song's chorus expresses the depth and intensity of the narrator's feeling. Priya Elan of "NME" opines that she repeats the word "like sheâs been sucker-punched by the sheer intensity of her heart-shaped feeling. Sheâs revelling in the joy of it, but also realising the utter failure of the simple four-letter word to express the depth of what sheâs experiencing." Croft said that the song is "very positive lyrically" and that its album "goes through a few different stages, and this would be the lightest." Puja Patel of "Spin" characterizes its subject matter as "loverlorn" and observes a balance "between honest, gut-wrenching desire and stalker-like idolization".
Live performances.
The xx premiered the song at Electrowerkz in Islington, London on 14 May 2012, their first live show since 2010. They subsequently performed "Angels" on "Conan" on 24 July.
Reception.
Pitchfork Media's Larry Fitzmaurice noted the song's "percussive touch" as an indication that "the xx are changing ... slowly and subtly, two characteristics that's always been part of their central appeal." SiÃ¢n Rowe of "NME" called it "a heart-meltingly perfect follow-on from their debut", and the magazine's Priya Elan dubbed it "the boldest Valentine the band have ever recorded." Michael Cragg of "The Guardian" commented that "their ability to make minimalism seem warm and comforting still intact." Allmusic's Heather Phares called the song a "lovely album opener" and wrote that the band's "elegantly serpentine guitars â which recalled the Cure and Durutti Column on "xx" ... are now entirely their own". The Quietus critiqued that "it feels a bit more confident; where Oliver Sim and Madley-Croft's wordplay on their debut was tentative, there's a newfound directness". Brendan Frank of Beats Per Minute commended Croft for "delivering a simple love note to an anonymous recipient," adding that "she does a magnificent job of carrying the piece on her own." Stephen Thompson of NPR called "Angels" a "gentle love song made all the more disarming for its simplicity," writing that it "ratchets up the tension using the fewest possible ingredients."
Cover versions.
In 2012, British band Bastille covered "Angels" alongside TLC's "No Scrubs" in a mash-up entitled "No Angels". The mash-up featured as one of eleven tracks on the band's second mixtape, "Other People's Heartache, Pt. 2".

COMPASS-2

COMPASS-2 will become the second satellite series of the FH Aachen, designed by students only. The students of FH Aachen develop the satellite BUS system with the necessary subsystems for power generation, power distribution, data handling, communication and data / power interfaces for the payload. There will be two experiment boxes placed around the BUS-Cube that can easily be replaced using a standardized connection and mounting system.
Objective.
The objective of COMPASS-2 is to achieve the following goal:
Development and Construction of a universal experimental technology platform as a Triple-CubeSat to consolidate an international standard.
To accomplish this goal, the satellite BUS-system will be designed for two universal payloads. The design of the satellite subsystems includes the lessons-learned from the COMPASS-1 system with a higher reliability and efficiency. The idea is to build a universal BUS-system for further space applications and small experiments. Two cubes will carry the payload. The interfaces to the Experiments will be defined in a universal way so that the experiments, which are implemented in the payload cubes, get their own power and data interface. The target orbit is estimated to a low-earth orbit with a medium altitude to have a faster disposal after the mission time.
STR â Structure.
The structure of COMPASS-2 is based on the requirements of the CubeSat standard. It is the mounting structure for all components of the satellite. The mounting system is the interface for the PCBs of each system, the battery and solar panels as well as for the payload. COMPASS-2 will become a nano satellite with a size of 100mm x 100mm x 340.5mm. The mass may not exceed 4Â kg. The structure is made of lightweight aluminum.
The universal design of the COMPASS-2 system also allows to design a smaller version of it in a Double-Cube-Sat version. The dimensions of 100mm x 100mm x 227mm allow a maximum mass of 2.66Â kg.
EPS â Electrical Power System.
The functions of the power system are to generate and store electric power for usage by the other spacecraft subsystems. The subsystems can have various specific requirements for voltage, frequency, stability, noise limits or others. These characteristics have to be considered on supplying the different subsystems. It is also a part of the power system to set the operating mode to prevent an early end of mission caused by lack of energy. To maintain the long-term reliability of the system, the power system provides protection to other subsystems against malfunction.
Power Source / Solar Cells.
As power source, COMPASS-2 has about 30 solar cells on the surface (depending on the final configuration). Three areas will contain eight solar cells and the fourth area will contain six solar cells. The solar cells have an efficiency of 30.5%. Equipped with these solar cells, the satellite will generate an average power output of 5.1 Watt (flying vertically - Nadir) and 3.5 Watt (flying astronomical horizontally) in sun synchronous orbit.
Power Storage / Batteries.
For COMPASS-2 the newest battery technology will be used. Two Nanophosphate High Power Lithium Ion Cells will be providing the satellite with power in night or high power demand phases. The satellite will have an alternating charging system to reduce the charging cycles for each battery. Due to the fact that the batteries are not space-proved, one tasks of the power system team is to test the batteries under space conditions.
Power Distribution & Control.
One of the tasks for EPS is to control and distribute the available power. The system will set the satellite in three different modes:
Also it is necessary that the ground station can control the different modes and settings.
COM - Communication.
The communications system will provide reliable data connection between ground station and the satellite. The main objective is downloading data and uploading commands and firmware.
In comparison to COMPASS-1, this mission will have a focus on channel coding and adaptive modulation in order to improve the amount of data transferred during each flyover. This also includes smart software at the ground station for signal processing. On the classic VHF-UHF-Bands we implemented new modulation methods to provide a higher data rate while staying compatible to default ham radio equipment. Besides there will be a S-Band down-link giving a down-link speed of about 500 kbit/s.
Modulation Methods.
Due to the system design, the modulation signal can be created by the COM micro controller. This gives the chance to do the entire modulation signal processing inside the software. Just one transmitter is needed for all transmission types. The software defines which one is used at which moment. The base band waveforms are calculated inside the software and fed into a digital-analog converter. Here the digital waveforms are converted into voltages. A well-dimensioned anti-aliasing filter is used to create a high-quality modulation signal. Depending on the actual demands and link quality, modulation is adaptively and automatically changed by handshaking with the operating ground station. As an experimental addition, hierarchic modulation is used to allow two or more different data rates at same time.
As the COMPASS-2 group is expecting support and help from amateur radio enthusiasts all over the world, the transmission modulation must be compatible to standard amateur radio operators receiving equipment. This means non-coherent receiving with channel width of maximum 6Â kHz. Thus, all phase concerning modulations are a no-go. The ground station software will include the possibility for channel equalization, paying attention to the non-linear frequency response of amateur radio receivers.
As an experiment hierarchic modulation using FSK will be used to allow different data speeds at the same time using complex channel coding. The higher data rate needs high link quantity to be decoded properly. The lower one is receivable with high noise impact.
As is it planned to use a PC system with a sound-card connected to the radios, all signal decoding and processing can be done inside of the PC software. This makes the system flexible and low cost comparing to hardware decoders like Terminal Node Controllers. The CPU power of a standard home PC is enough to do all the encoding calculations.
Frequencies and Antenna Configuration.
Referring to the design of COMPASS-1, the design of COMPASS-2 will be very close to the old one, but with improvements and extensions. We will use just one transmit frequency. Due to the arbitrary modulation system, it's just the onboard software that defines the service. The uplink will be in the 2m amateur radio band (145Â MHz - referring to the 2m band plan) receiving FM modulated data packets and DTMF commands as a backup. The down-link will be on the 70Â cm amateur radio band (437Â MHz - referring to the 70Â cm band plan). On the down-link data frequency we will be able to send packet data, SSTV still picture images, Morse code and maybe some short voice messages. The Morse code transmission is elementary necessary for receiving the status directly after the deployment out of the launch pod, recovering the satellite and long time health measurement of the satellite. Nearly every radio amateur is familiar to Morse code, so it is possible to get telemetry from every part of the world.
Ground Station.
The satellite will be operated by the ground station at the FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences. The radio station contains an ICOM IC-910H, an IC-821H and two PCs. The IC-910H is used for sending on the 2m band with 100 Watts and receiving packet data in the 70Â cm band. The bandwidth is 6Â kHz. The antenna set consists of four cross-Yagi antennas with a +20dB preamplifier for UHF (70Â cm receiving) and two cross-Yagi antennas for VHF (2m sending), both right turning polarized, controlled via an Egis Rotor with full horizontal coverage. The azimuth is able to drive 450Â° and the elevator can rotate up to 90Â°. For tracking the satellite and for the antenna rotor control the station uses SATPC32, which also adjusts the radios frequency to compensate the Doppler shift. For a correct tracking and Doppler shift correction it is necessary to update the Kepler elements weekly from Celestrak, a free of charge service for tracking satellites in space. The structure of the software will be modular giving the chance to work and improve on the components separately. Key features are:
In addition to the ground station in Aachen, many private amateur radio stations joined us as backup stations during the mission operation of COMPASS-1. The COMPASS-2 Team also will encourage the stations to participate loading data and decoding Morse code from COMPASS-2.
CDHS â Command and Data Handling System.
Main Tasks.
The CDHS is the main board of the COMPASS-2 Satellite. It is responsible for managing all general and system data. It is also responsible for forwarding commands from the ground station to the subsystems and when requested sending internally generated data back to earth.
Redundancy.
Firmware update:
To allow further improvements after the launch of the satellite, it is wise to allow reprogramming the main controllers of the subsystems. Multiple firmware storage modules are implemented in the design. For more security in worst-case scenario, the default firmware, which is stored previously on the satellite, will be recalled and the controllers of the satellite will be programmed as prior to launch.
Data recovery.
In case of a total loss of the command an data handling system, routines implemented on the COM system will allow a direct access to the stored data. This will be used to recover the generated data until subsystem loss, allowing access to HK data for failure analysis or even download science data.
Storage Media.
Out of many storage medium technologies the CDHS picks out the most suitable technology for the application it is intended to be used for:
System Architecture.
Controller Area Network - CAN:
The satellite provides a CAN bus system for designated data routes. The following are the groups of data an SPI bus is designated to.
Serial Bus
The communication of commands between the COM and the CDHS system will occur through a serial interface. A second bus will be used for data transfer, allowing the access of both, COM and ADCS, subsystems to the storage media.
ADCS - Attitude Determination and Control System.
Main Tasks.
The major objective of this subsystem is to obtain an attitude control, which fulfills the
requirements of pointing, stability and agility of as many payloads as possible. Due to the size, the
weightbudget, the powerbudget and the desire to use of the shelf products the main requirements
can just be obtained to a certain level. Parts of the subsystem are and will be manufactured by the
team. Due to the fact, that not all of the parts have been finished it is not possible to estimate and
simulate the overall performance of this subsystem yet.
Environmental Effects on Attitude Control.
To develop an attitude control system it is necessary to be aware of the environmental effects acting
on the satellite in a certain orbit. The following environmental effects have to be considered:
These effects interacting with the satellite generate torques. These torques can either be used for
passive or active attitude control or be regarded as disturbance torques. The estimation of the
maximum acting torques is possible in a conservative analytical way. For more precise estimations
and for average values a simulation of the acting torques is necessary. The more precise these values
are the better an optimisation of the attitude control system is possible.
Actuators.
To realize the generic concept of COMPASS-2 the ADCS team has to develop all actuators, because
of the low volume budgets given by the CubeSat standards the actuators have to be miniaturized.
The following actuators are developed to get implemented on the COMPASS-2 Triple-CubeSat:
Reaction Wheels.
Well designed Reaction wheels can provide a high actuating accuracy which do not depend on
environmental effects. There is a development of reaction wheels by the COMPASS-2 team in
progress.
Magnetorquers.
COMPASS-2 will use air core coils like the previous COMPASS project as magnetorquers for the
active attitude control. The reason for chosing magnetorquers as part of the attitude control system
is the reliability and the simple design. Air core coils were chosen, because we are able to optimize
and manufacture them ourselves. Ferrite core coils are more efficient regarding space and power
consumption, but the optimization, calculation and production is much more complicated. So we
decided to keep it as simple and cost efficient as possible and use air core coil magnetorquers as our
prime active attitude control actuators. There will be three actuators oriented perpendicular to
each other. Through this orientation attitude control is possible regardless how the satellite is
oriented to the magnetic field lines.
Gravity Gradient Boom (GGB).
A gravity gradient boom is a passive attitude control actuator. Therefore no power or control loop is
needed during operation. Using a gravity gradient boom just two pointings of the satellite with
regard to the earth center is possible. Either pointing to the earth center or pointing away from the
earth center. So it is a severe limitation of attitude control and just usable in certain missions. There
is a development of a gravity gradient boom, but as an add on system only if reasonable for a
certain mission.
Aerodynamic drag stabilization.
A further passive actuating torque will be created by the aerodynamic drag in the low earth orbit
and may lead to a helpful stabilization of the satellite. Aerodynamic drag and the resulting torque
cannot be avoided and the team will try to get partial advantage if possible.
Sensor technology.
Digital multi-image sensors (DMIS).
Digital multi-image sensors (DMIS) are digital cameraâbased instruments for detecting the center
of the sun and calculating the angle between the sun vector and the camera's view vector on the x and
y axis. Additionally, the earth's horizon and the rotation rate of the satellite can be determined.
Therefore an attitude measurement using the earth's horizon is possible, too.
Furthermore the sensors are able to store colored images for later transmission to earth.
3-Axis Magnetometer.
The magnetometer is absolutely necessary for running the magnetorquers. Further they are needed
as a reference for calculating the attitude matrix with the help of the earthâs magnetic field.
Spin Rate Sensor (Gyro).
The gyros are only for redundancy. These sensors deliver a reference to the calculated tumbling
frequency calculated by the DSS and the magnetometer. These sensors determine compared to the
DSS and the magnetometer the attitude inertial and not by using a reference. The gyros make use of
a micro-electro-mechanical system which determines the actual attitude with the help of the coriolis
force produced by a rotating body.
TCS â Thermal Control System.
Due to the small amount of dissipating heat and the wide operating temperature range of the (LiFePo4) accumulator (-30Â Â°C till +60Â Â°C), the TCS will be a passive regulated system with the advantage of energy saving while keeping the satellite and its subsystems within the allowable temperature limits. The limits are normally -40Â Â°C till +125Â Â°C for commercial off-the-shelf products, but some parts of the COM-subsystem are more temperature sensitive and should not exceed +85Â Â°C. The problem is here the high energy consumption and the involved high local (on an area of only 9mmÂ²) dissipation.
Resource management.
The temperature will not be monitored all the time but at a given period to realize low power consumption. The temperature-information search will be as intelligent as possible. This means, that if the temperature at one point of the CubeSat exceed a certain threshold a few times, the program will automatically collect more information in a shorter period to locate the reason and to ensure better research for future missions.
Main tasks.
The energy from the incoming electromagnetic radiation is basically converted into heat. Thus it is the most important base for the thermal budget. Relevant for the TCS is the direct solar radiation, the reflected solar radiation from the earth/moon and the infrared radiation of the earth/moon. Therefore it is very important to know the chronological sequence and the orbital parameters because these parameters will all be considered and processed in our thermal analysis.
All influences have to be combined with the temperature range of the electrical parts in the spacecraft. Precisely because we are using commercial off-the-shelf-products, it is indispensable to hold the satellite in an "earth like" environment. Therefore we are using some several insulation techniques like foils, coatings and so on to get the satellite in this marginal temperature range as well as to guarantee a good environment for micro controllers, sensors and the payload.
Methods and techniques.
We combine some ways of setting up the temperature:
Payload.
In the following, the requirements for one experiment box are listed. Given these âhard factsâ, any payload provider will be able to build its payload without any much communication with the COMPASS-2 Team to adapt the payload to the BUS cube:
the overall energy needed for each payload can be scheduled between the customers via FH Aachen.
data transfer protocol:
CAN
I2C
max data rate :
amount of data rate can be scheduled between the customers via the FH Aachen
Testing.
Testing must be performed to achieve all launch provider requirements as well as any additional testing requirements deemed necessary to ensure the safety of the CubeSats and the P-POD. All flight hardware will undergo qualification and acceptance testing. The P-PODs will be tested in a similar manner to ensure the safety and feasibility before the CubeSats will be integrated. All CubeSats have to pass the following tests:
Vibration Test.
Vibration tests serve the simulation of dynamic mechanical loads. This is tested with oscillations in the frequency response range of 1 to 2000Â Hz.
The goals of vibration tests are:
For the vibration test, the satellite is housed in a test POD which is mounted to a shaker table. The vibration loads are measured immediately by acceleration sensors, which are mounted on several points on the test POD. To improve the measured values, several sensors are monitoring the vibration behavior. All these values are computed to an average value for further analyses. The vibration load tests are performed through the three main axes.
Solar-Simulation Test.
The solar intensity in low-earth orbit is about 1368 W/mÂ². With the sun simulator, the effects from the high solar radiation flux onto the spacecraft are tested. The sun-simulator is using a xenon lamp to simulate the solar radiation. The spectrum of this lamp is - except of a spectral peak, caused by the properties of xenon - very similar to the natural sunlight.
Thermal-Vacuum Test.
During this test, the satellite is put into a high-vacuum chamber for several temperature cycles and the thermal behavior of the satellite is tested.
All tests will be executed at the FH Aachen.
Outlook and Project Status.
COMPASS-2 will be a good platform for companies and research institutes to bring small experiments and new technologies rapidly into space at low cost.

All The Bells is an artwork by Martin Creed first given in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October 2006, where it attracted little favourable attention. Its rubric was: "All of the bells in a city or town rung as quickly and loudly as possible for three minutes" (or in Spanish, "Todas las campanas en una ciudad o pueblo sonando tan rÃ¡pido y duro como sea posible por tres minutos").

Ecovative Design

Headquartered in Green Island, New York, Ecovative Design LLC is a medium size, bio-materials company focusing on developing innovative materials from natural growth processes.
History.
Ecovative is developed from a university project of founders Eben Bayer and Gavin McIntyre. In their Inventor's Studio course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute taught by Burt Swersey, Eben and Gavin pursued mycelium as a binding substance to create a mushroom-based insulation, formerly called Greensulate. In Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's business incubator, the pair patented the material. In 2008, they were awarded $700,000 first place in the Picnic Green Challenge. 
Since 2008, Ecovative Design has developed and commercialized production of a protective packaging called EcoCradle. Non-food agricultural by-products like husks and plant stalks from rice, buckwheat, and cottonseed combine with mycelium to grow tunable materials like EcoCradle. The company has produced protective packaging for companies including Dell, Puma SE, and Steelcase. In spring 2012, Ecovative Design opened a new production facility and announced a partnership with Sealed Air to expand production of the packaging materials.
Technology.
Ecovative Design has developed a process which uses fungal mycelium to bind materials together and grow them into specific shapes. The process uses an agricultural waste product such as cotton hulls, cleaning the material, heating it up, inoculating it to create growth of the fungal mycelium, growing the material for period of about five days, and finally heating it to make the fungus inert.
During growth, the material's shape can be molded into various products including protective packaging, building products, apparel, car bumpers, or surfboards. 
The environmental footprint of the products is minimized through the use of agricultural waste, reliance on natural and non-controlled growth environments, and home compostable final products.
Media.
Popular Science featured the composite insulation in its 2009 Invention Awards. Season 6, Episode 8 (25:20) of , also featured the insulation as lab technicians tested the materials' flame resistant properties after finding particles on a victim's clothing. Packaging World magazine featured Ecovative on its July 2011 cover, suggesting that the company is poised to "be a game changer in various industries." 
The World Economic Forum also recognized Ecovative as a Technology Pioneer in 2011.
Support.
The development of the material and processes has been supported by the Picnic Green Challenge, the Environmental Protection Agency, National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), ASME, the National Science Foundation, NYSERDA, 3M New Ventures, The DOEN Foundation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a license agreement with Sealed Air. 
In addition to an array of awards, Ecovative's materials have been extensively highlighted in Material ConneXion libraries around the world.

Caymus Vineyards

Caymus Vineyards is a Napa winery owned by Chuck Wagner and his family.
History.
The Wagner family has farmed the current Caymus property to wine grapes since the 1940s; until 1972, when the winery was established, the fruit was sold to other area wineries.
The vineyard was planted to Nathan Fay's clone of Cabernet Sauvignon in the 1960s. Fay also famously provided grapes to Stag's Leap Wine Cellars.
In 1975, the winery hired Randy Dunn as winemaker, and offered the first vintage of their flagship wine, the Caymus Special Selection. The Special Selection is not produced every year, but only in "better years" (the last vintage of Special Selection not to be released was 1996). In 1989 the 1984 Special Selection was named Wine Spectator magazineâs âWine of the Year.â The 1990 Special Selection received the same title in 1994, making Caymus the only winery in the world to have received the award twice. The winery makes a "regular" cabernet that is released annually. 
Chuck Wagner, Charles' son, took over winemaking duties in 1984, a role which he continues to hold to this day.
Wines.
In addition to the two Cabernets, the Wagners also produce small amounts of zinfandel and sauvignon blanc under the Caymus label. The family also makes other wines under the "Wagner Family of Wine" -- Mer Soleil, Conundrum, and Belle Glos -- out of non-Cabernet varietals. Mer Soleil is a Chardonnay label made by Charlie Wagner, Chuck Wagner's eldest son, with 2 wines; the "Silver" is unoaked, while the "regular" sees barrels. Belle Glos is a Pinot noir label made by Chuck Wagner's other son, Joseph Wagner, with 5 wines; four single-vineyard wines, and a blend of vineyards that goes into "Meiomi." Conundrum produces non-varietal white and red wine.

<doc id="36541762" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36541762" title="Abu Alkian">
Abu Alkian

The Abu Alkian bedouin ) is a Bedouin tribe living in Negev, Israel.
History.
Abu Alkian Bedouin and Fellah clan arrived in Negev at the end of the 19th century. Their name translates to "Valley people". Tribe leaders made an agreement with a local El Huzayil Bedouin clan and settled in the area, where kibbutz Shoval is situated today (north-west from Rahat). Abu Alkian remained there until 1956, but due to a conflict with the neighboring clan, they were forced to leave and look for a new place to live. Eventually, they settled in two villages in the Yatir area the same year.
Present day.
Since the end of the 1980s the major part of Abu Alkian clan - 3,200 of 4,300 people, or roughly 75 per cent (according to May 2012) - resides in their homes in a planned Bedouin township of Hura (Houra). As for the rest â around 1,000 people â they are scattered and live in two main clusters - unrecognized villages Atir and Um al-Hiran.
Hura.
Israel has spent tens of millions of shekels on a program to settle members of the clan in a planned neighborhood of Hura built especially for them. It is one of seven Bedouin townships in the Negev desert with approved plans and developed infrastructure (other six are: Ar'arat an-Naqab (Ar'ara BaNegev), Lakiya, Shaqib al-Salam (Segev Shalom), Kuseife (Kseife), Tel as-Sabi (Tel-Sheva) and the city of Rahat, the largest among them).
They were built in order to sedentarize Negev Bedouin and provide them with all the basic services, like work, education, medical infrastructure, etc. There is an industrial park in Hura, 8 schools, branches of several health funds (medical clinics), and several community centers. A number of community projects were initiated here in order to fight female unemployment.
Dispersion.
About 1,000 clan members live in two unrecognized villages: Atir and Um al-Hiran. Since the municipal status of these villages is not recognized by the state, they don't have basic infrastructure: electricity supply, running water or sewerage. Abu Alkian clan members living in dispersion have been offered to move into Houra and receive different benefits, for example, land lots at low prices. Nevertheless, they are reluctant to change their residence.

Hanajira

Al-Hanajira (also Arab al-Hanajira, al-Hanajra or el-Hanajreh) was one of the five principal Bedouin tribes inhabiting the Negev Desert prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Its territory stretched north-south between Deir al-Balah and Gaza and east to the lands of the Tarabin bedouin, straddling the Hejaz Railway line. Under the British Mandate, the territory was divided between its Gaza and Beersheba. The largest clan was Abu Middein. In the 1931 British census of Palestine, Abu Middein numbered 1,419, Nuseirat numbered 1,104, Sumeiri 772, and al-Dawahra 461, bringing the total to 3,735. By the summer of 1946 the population increased to 7,125. In 1981 the population living in the Gaza Strip was roughly 10,000. 
History.
In 1830, the Acre-based governor of Gaza, Abdallah Pasha, concentrated his forces to put down a rebellion in Jabal Nablus, leaving Gaza and the Negev relatively unsecured. The Bani Attiya tribe of Wadi Araba sought to exploit the lack of state authority and encroached upon the territories of the Negev Bedouin tribes, including the Beersheba plains, without the permission of Salman Ali Azzam al-Huzayl, the Tiyaha chief of the area. Al-Huzayl subsequently formed a coalition with the Hanajira and evicted the Bani Atiyya after four battles at Wadi Ar'ara, Tell Rakhima, Wadi Abu Tulul and al-Mashash. The Palestine Exploration Fund reported that in the late 19th-century, the Hanajira grew tobacco and watermelons at Khirbet Emkemen between Khan Yunis and Rafah. 
During the British Mandate period between 1920 to 1947, the overall chief of the al-Hanajira and one of the influential tribal chiefs in the Negev was Sheikh Freih Farhan Abu Middein. He served with the British Army during World War I, and after the Mandate's establishment, he was appointed to the Tribal Court and the Advisory Council of the High Commissioner. In the early 1920s he became the mayor of Beersheba, his place of residence, and in 1922 became a member of the Legislative Council. The chief of the Nuseirat during this period was Sheikh Aaysh Farhan al-Msaddar, who was later succeeded by Sheikh Freih al-Msaddar in 1940. 
In 1946 Sheikh Freih al-Msaddar became a major figure within Jamal al-Husayni's Palestine Arab Party in the Beersheba region and the Arab Higher Committee's finance committee. In April 1948 Sheikh Freih al-Msaddar was among the notables who welcomed volunteers from the Muslim Brotherhood coming from Egypt to fight Israeli forces in Palestine. The head of the Sumeiri tribe during the Mandate period was Selim Abdullah al-Sumeiri, who was succeeded Sheikh Juma'h al-Sumeiri, while the head of al-Dawadra was Ahmad Abu Daher. 
Towards 1948 the Hanajira largely transformed into a settled agricultural community. Following the Israeli Army's main offensive against Egyptian forces in the Gaza region and its capture of the western Negev Desert in late December 1948 during the First Arab-Israeli War, the Israelis expelled the Abu Middein, Sumeiri and al-Dawahra clans to the Gaza Strip, while the Nsirat were either expelled to the Gaza Strip or Jordan. After the 1967 Six-Day War, many of the Nsirat were evicted by Israeli authorities and relocated to Jordan. 
Freih Mustafa Abu Middein, the grandson of the Abu Middein clan's former chief Sheikh Freih Farhan, was appointed the Minister of Justice by then-Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat in the 1990s.
Education.
Out of a population of 7,125, 500 members of the al-Hanajira clan were literate in 1947. They attended two schools, the Hanajirat Abu Middein School founded 12 kilometers south of Gaza in 1924 and the Nuseirat School founded 5 kilometers east of Deir al-Balah in 1944. The former was divided into four grade levels with one educator and had 75 pupils, while the latter was divided into three grade levels and had 69 pupils.

Menunketesuck Island

Menunketesuck Island, also known as Menunketesuck Point, is an island in Long Island Sound belonging to the town of Westbrook, Connecticut in Middlesex County, Connecticut.
Physical description.
Menunketesuck Island consists of approximately 4.6 acres of land, though the actual acreage varies according to the tides. Although the elevation of the island reaches as much as 8 to 10 feet towards the center, the island perimeter consists largely of tidal flats, shoals and sandbars which are exposed at low tide, but underwater during high tide.
The narrow island measures approximately 2,100 feet long and 170 feet wide during high tide; length increases to roughly 2,700 feet during low tide, with some portions of the island growing up to 270 feet wide. 
During high tide, the northern end of the island lies approximately 700 feet from the shoreline. Because low tide exposes expansive sandbars and tidal flats, the distance from the shoreline decreases considerably, usually averaging between 100 and 200 feet from the mainland. The island is separated from the mainland by exceptionally shallow water during low tide, such that it can easily be accessed on foot. During high tide, the depth of the water increases to approximately 5 to 8 feet deep.
Conservation.
Menunketesuck Island is part of the Salt Meadow Unit of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. The National Audubon Society has also dubbed the island an "Important Bird Area".

Alon Tal

Alon Tal (, born 12 July 1960) is a leading Israeli environmental activist, co-founder of the Israel Union for Environmental Defense, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies and the Green Zionist Alliance, and co-chair of the Green Movement political party.
Early life.
Tal was born on July 12, 1960, and grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, as Albert Rosenthal. He was active in the Young Judaea youth movement, served on its national executive board, and participated in its Israel program in 1977. After graduating from the University of North Carolina in 1980, he moved to Israel and enlisted in the Israeli army. He changed his name to Alon Tal after making aliyah to Israel and becoming an Israeli citizen. He served in the Nahal paratrooper division and saw action in the 1982 First Lebanon War. After his discharge, Tal attended Hebrew University Law School in Jerusalem. During his time in law school, he worked as a legal intern in Israelâs Environmental Protection Service (part of the Ministry of Interior) and subsequently clerked in the office of Israelâs Attorney General, Yitzhak Zamir. In 1986, Tal returned to the U.S. and enrolled in the Harvard School of Public Health, where he studied Environmental Science and Public Policy. His doctoral dissertation, which was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, analyzed state strategies to control agricultural nonpoint source pollution.
Environmental career.
Tal returned to Israel in 1989 and settled at kibbutz Ketura with his wife Robyn. In 1990, he founded the Israel Union for Environmental Defense, one of Israelâs leading advocacy groups. In this capacity, he initiated successful legal action to address a range of environmental hazards (for example, illegal sewage discharges and air and water pollution), repeatedly sued the government for inadequate implementation of environmental law, and provided free legal representation to numerous local environmental organizations. In 1995, the organization filed a highly publicized â but ultimately unsuccessful â petition to the Supreme Court to prevent the building of Highway 6.
In 1996, Tal founded the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies at kibbutz Ketura, an advanced academic program that brings together Israelis, Palestinians, Jordanians and international students. In 1999, he was elected chairman of Life and Environment, the umbrella organization for Israelâs environmental groups, which grew from 24 to 80 member groups during his five-year tenure.
In 1998, Tal was a visiting scholar at the University of Otago in New Zealand, where he wrote "Pollution in a Promised Land", a comprehensive history of Israelâs environment. Tal joined the faculty of Ben Gurion University in 2005 as an associate professor in the Department of Desert Ecology at the universityâs Sde Boker campus. His research has focused on monitoring transboundary stream water quality, assessing the Israeli governmentâs environmental enforcement program, evaluating national environmental education programs, surveying Israelâs environmental movement, and assessing a range of environmental history and policy issues.
In 2001, Tal co-founded the Green Zionist Alliance: The Grassroots Campaign for a Sustainable Israel, a New York-based nonprofit that works to protect the environment of Israel and the Middle East. Since then, Tal has served on the Green Zionist Alliance's Israeli advisory board.
In 2002, Tal joined the international board of the Jewish National Fund (JNF), Israelâs forestry and land reclamation agency, as an elected representative of the Green Zionist Alliance, in partnership with the Conservative Movement. He was appointed chair of the JNFâs subcommittee for sustainability, which in 2005 drafted new policies for the organizationâs forestry, reservoirs and stream restoration program. Since 2006, he has served as chair of the Land Development Committee, which oversees the JNFâs forestry and land restoration work. The committeeâs efforts have helped expand funding for sustainable afforestation, bike trails and research.
In 2007, Tal and Mohammad Said Al-Hmaida, former director of the Palestinian Ministry of Environment, were commissioned by Friends of the Earth Middle East to write a âshadow treatyâ for a final settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, which offered an ambitious vision of cooperation and coordinated management. Tal also helped bring together 15 Israeli and 15 Palestinian water experts to consider specific areas of agreement and disagreements in regional water management, which was published in the 2010 book "Water Wisdom".
Tal won the Charles Bronfman Prize for young humanitarian leadership in 2006 and used the prize money to establish the Tal Fund, which supports grassroots Israeli environmental activism. Tal received Israelâs Environment Ministryâs lifetime achievement award as a 48 year old, in honor of Israelâs 60th anniversary in 2008.
In 2011, Tal was a visiting professor at Stanford Universityâs Center for Conservation Biology where he wrote "All the Trees of the Forest: Israelâs Woodlands from the Bible to the Present" which was published in November 2013. In 2012 he chaired the 4th International Conference on Drylands, Deserts and Desertification at Ben Gurion University.
Tal presently lives in Macabim with his wife and three daughters, is active in his local Masorti synagogue as community gabai, and intermittently plays fiddle and mandolin in the Arava Riders, an Israeli bluegrass band.
Political career.
Green movement.
In 2008, Tal was among the founders of the Green Movement, which ran in the 2009 Knesset elections on a joint ticket with Meimad. Tal was the third candidate on the slate. The party received 1% of the popular vote, which fell short of the required 2% threshold.
In 2010, Tal was elected chair of the party and began promoting a broad social and environmental agenda. Shortly thereafter, the Green Movement took legal action to prevent the appointment of Yoav Galant as chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, due to his seizure of public land next to his home and the filing of a false affidavit to the Supreme Court. The Attorney General eventually accepted the Green Movement's position and Galant's appointment was cancelled. During Tal's tenure, the party also initiated campaigns to save the Samar sand dunes, to prevent the privatization of national parks, to stop the development of highway overpasses in the Jerusalem Forest and to create a âGreen New Dealâ for Israelâs economy. Tal also successfully sponsored an initiative to ensure gender equality in the party, ensuring parallel female and male party co-chairs.
Tal is one of the only advocates for a national policy to reduce population growth in Israel. In 2011, a national convention of the Green Party supported a position that in general recognized the importance of the population issue, but chose not to prioritize it immediately.
Tal called attention to population growth as early as 2002, in "Pollution in the Promised Land", his survey of environmental history in Israel:
2013 legislative elections.
In 2012, Tal ran for the Knesset under the Hatnuah party for the January 22, 2013 elections, as number 13 on the party list. Six months after the elections, he stepped down as party chairman to complete his sabbatical at Stanford where he wrote his most recent book: "The Earth is Full: Addressing Overpopulation in Israel."

El PonceÃ±o

El PonceÃ±o, founded in 1852, was the first newspaper published in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The paper was originally named "El Observador PonceÃ±o" but it was shortened to "El PonceÃ±o".
History.
El PonceÃ±o was founded by Daniel Rivera. It came to the light of day at a time of political repression of the press in Puerto Rico. Yet, "despite a late start in Puerto Rico, the press played a significant role in the literature and the cultural life of Puerto Rico. The Royal Decree of 1834 censured the printing of texts and this was also applied to the press. In 1836 there was a restoration of the freedom of the press for Spanish papers but not for papers published in the Spanish colonies. Despite this, in 1839 the "BoletÃ­n Instructivo y Mercantil de Puerto Rico" was established in San Juan. In 1848 "El Imparcial" was founded in Mayaguez; it lasted 50 days before being vanished by Governor Juan Prim. Likewise El PonceÃ±o was also shut down, but "in its short life it managed to become part of the cultural life and the sustainment of economic development" of the area. The paper was founded in 1852 in the city of Ponce as "El Observador PonceÃ±o" It was a weekly paper, published on Saturdays. The paper was located on Calle Cristina, in the same structure that Luis Munoz Rivera later published "La Democracia."
Coverage.
The paper covered issues related to municipal (improvements, roads, bridges) and island affairs as well as political matters. Poetry was one method used in the paper to publish popular thought. Satire was another. One of the better known writers in this paper was Ramon Marin. Ramon Marin later became a well-known Ponce historian and one of his grandchildren became governor of Puerto Rico. According to VillagÃ³mez, one reason the paper evaded official censure was because it contained mostly articles that "were not a threat to the colonial political system but a criticism to the pro-slavery society in Ponce.
Closure.
Enjoying two years of continuous weekly publishing, El PonceÃ±o was shut down by the Spanish government in July 1854. The orders came from the Spanish governor in the Island, Fernando de Norzagaray, for offending the conservative views of his administration. Tensions had been building for some time, but the July 22, 1854 publishing of a poem by Daniel Rivera title "AgÃ¼eybanÃ¡ El Bravo" proved too much for the conservative Spanish government to bear. The poem praised the 1511 Taino Indian revolt against the Spanish invaders. Daviel Rivera was sent into exile by Norzagaray.
Daniel Rivera's poem read, in part, as follows:
After the closing of El PonceÃ±o, Vilardell founded "El FÃ©nix", and performed as both reporter and editor. He also went into the insurance business.
