Serial module

In abstract algebra, a uniserial module "M" is a module over a ring "R", whose submodules are totally ordered by inclusion. This means simply that for any two submodules "N"1 and "N"2 of "M", either formula_1 or formula_2. A module is called a serial module if it is a direct sum of uniserial modules. A ring "R" is called a right uniserial ring if it is uniserial as a right module over itself, and likewise called a right serial ring if it is a right serial module over itself. Left uniserial and left serial rings are defined in an analogous way, and are in general distinct from their right counterparts.
An easy motivational example is the quotient ring formula_3 for any integer formula_4. This ring is always serial, and is uniserial when "n" is a prime power.
The term "uniserial" has been used differently from the above definition: for clarification see this section.
A partial alphabetical list of important contributors to the theory of serial rings includes the mathematicians Keizo Asano, I. S. Cohen, P.M. Cohn, Yu. Drozd, D. Eisenbud, A. Facchini, A.W. Goldie, Phillip Griffith, I. Kaplansky, V.V Kirichenko, G. Köthe, H. Kuppisch, I. Murase, T. Nakayama, P. Příhoda, G. Puninski, and R. Warfield. References for each author can be found in and .
Following the common ring theoretic convention, if a left/right dependent condition is given without mention of a side (for example, uniserial, serial, Artinian, Noetherian) then it is assumed the condition holds on both the left and right. Unless otherwise specified, each ring in this article is a ring with unity, and each module is unital.
Properties of uniserial and serial rings and modules.
It is immediate that in a uniserial "R"-module "M", all submodules except "M" and 0 are simultaneously essential and superfluous. If "M" has a maximal submodule, then "M" is a local module. "M" is also clearly a uniform module and thus is directly indecomposable. It is also easy to see that every finitely generated submodule of "M" can be generated by a single element, and so "M" is a Bézout module.
It is known that the endomorphism ring EndR("M") is a semilocal ring which is very close to a local ring in the sense that EndR("M") has at most two maximal right ideals. If "M" is required to be Artinian or Noetherian, then EndR("M") is a local ring.
Since rings with unity always have a maximal right ideal, a right uniserial ring is necessarily local. As noted before, a finitely generated right ideal can be generated by a single element, and so right uniserial rings are right Bézout rings. A right serial ring "R" necessarily factors in the form formula_5 where each "e"i is an idempotent element and "e"i"R" is a local, uniserial module. This indicates that "R" is also a semiperfect ring, which is a stronger condition than being a semilocal ring.
Köthe showed that the modules of Artinian principal ideal rings (which are a special case of serial rings) are direct sums of cyclic submodules. Later, Cohen and Kaplansky determined that a commutative ring "R" has this property for its modules if and only if "R" is an Artinian principal ideal ring. Nakayama showed that Artinian serial rings have this property on their modules, and that the converse is not true
The most general result, perhaps, on the modules of a serial ring is attributed to Drozd and Warfield: it states that every finitely presented module over a serial ring is a direct sum of cyclic uniserial submodules (and hence is serial). If additionally the ring is assumed to be Noetherian, the finitely presented and finitely generated modules coincide, and so all finitely generated modules are serial.
Being right serial is preserved under direct products of rings and modules, and preserved under quotients of rings. Being uniserial is preserved for quotients of rings and modules, but never for products. A direct summand of a serial module is not necessarily serial, as was proved by Puninski, but direct summands of "finite" direct sums of uniserial modules are serial modules .
It has been verified that Jacobson's conjecture holds in Noetherian serial rings.
Examples.
Any simple module is trivially uniserial, and likewise semisimple modules are serial modules.
Many examples of serial rings can be gleaned from the structure sections above. Every valuation ring is a uniserial ring, and all Artinian principal ideal rings are serial rings, as is illustrated by semisimple rings.
More exotic examples include the upper triangular matrices over a division ring Tn("D"), and the group ring formula_6 for some finite field of prime characteristic "p" and group "G" having a cyclic normal "p"-Sylow subgroup.
Structure.
This section will deal mainly with Noetherian serial rings and their subclass, Artinian serial rings. In general, rings are first broken down into indecomposable rings. Once the structure of these rings are known, the decomposable rings are direct products of the indecomposable ones. Also, for semiperfect rings such as serial rings, the basic ring is Morita equivalent to the original ring. Thus if "R" is a serial ring with basic ring "B", and the structure of "B" is known, the theory of Morita equivalence gives that formula_7 where "P" is some finitely generated progenerator "B". This is why the results are phrased in terms of indecomposable, basic rings.
In 1975, Kirichenko and Warfield independently and simultaneously published analyses of the structure of Noetherian, non-Artinian serial rings. The results were the same however the methods they used were very different from each other. The study of hereditary, Noetherian, prime rings, as well as quivers defined on serial rings were important tools. The core result states that a right Noetherian, non-Artinian, basic, indecomposable serial ring can be described as a type of matrix ring over a Noetherian, uniserial domain "V", whose Jacobson radical J("V") is nonzero. This matrix ring is a subring of Mn("V") for some "n", and consists of matrices with entries from "V" on and above the diagonal, and entries from J("V") below.
Artinian serial ring structure is classified in cases depending on the quiver structure. It turns out that the quiver structure for a basic, indecomposable, Artinian serial ring is always a circle or a line. In the case of the line quiver, the ring is isomorphic to the upper triangular matrices over a division ring (note the similarity to the structure of Noetherian serial rings in the preceding paragraph). A complete description of structure in the case of a circle quiver is beyond the scope of this article, but the complete description can be found in . To paraphrase the result as it appears there: A basic Artinian serial ring whose quiver is a circle is a homomorphic image of a "blow-up" of a basic, indecomposable, serial quasi-Frobenius ring.
A decomposition uniqueness property.
Two modules "U" and "V" are said to have the same monogeny class, denoted ["U"]m=["V"]m, if there exists a monomorphism formula_8 and a monomorphism formula_9. The dual notion can be defined: the modules are said to have the same epigeny class, denoted formula_10, if there exists an epimorphism formula_8 and an epimorphism formula_12.
The following weak form of the Krull-Schmidt theorem holds. Let "U"1... "U"n, "V"1, ..., "V"t be "n+t" non-zero uniserial right modules over a ring "R". Then the direct sums formula_13 and formula_14 are isomorphic "R"-modules if and only if "n=t" and there exist two permutations formula_15 and formula_16 of "1,2...,n" such that formula_17 for every "i=1,2..., n".
This result, due to Facchini, has been extended to infinite direct sums of uniserial modules by Příhoda in 2006. This extension involves the so-called quasismall uniserial modules. These modules were defined by Nguyen Viet Dung and Facchini, and their existence was proved by Puninski. The weak form of the Krull-Schmidt Theorem holds not only for uniserial modules, but also for several other classes of modules (biuniform modules, cyclically presented modules over serial rings, kernels of morphisms between indecomposable injective modules, couniformly presented modules.)
Notes on alternate, similar and related terms.
Right uniserial rings can also be referred to as right chain rings or right valuation rings. This latter term alludes to valuation rings, which are by definition commutative, uniserial domains. By the same token, uniserial modules have been called chain modules, and serial modules semichain modules. The notion of a catenary ring has "chain" as its namesake, but it is in general not related to chain rings.
In the 1930s, Gottfried Köthe and Keizo Asano introduced the term "Einreihig" (literally "one-series") during investigations of rings over which all modules are direct sums of cyclic submodules . For this reason, "uniserial" was used to mean "Artinian principal ideal ring" even as recently as the 1970s. Köthe's paper also required a uniserial ring to have a unique composition series, which not only forces the right and left ideals to be linearly ordered, but also requires that there be only finitely many ideals in the chains of left and right ideals. Because of this historical precedent, some authors include the Artinian condition or finite composition length condition in their definitions of uniserial modules and rings.
Expanding on Köthe's work, Tadashi Nakayama used the term "generalized uniserial ring" to refer to an Artinian serial ring. Nakayama showed that all modules over such rings are serial. Artinian serial rings are sometimes called Nakayama algebras, and they have a well-developed module theory.
Warfield used the term homogeneously serial module for a serial module with the additional property that for any two finitely generated submodules "A" and "B", formula_18 where "J"(-) denotes the Jacobson radical of the module . In a module with finite composition length, this has the effect of forcing the composition factors to be isomorphic, hence the "homogeneous" adjective. It turns out that a serial ring "R" is a finite direct sum of homogeneously serial right ideals if and only if "R" is isomorphic to a full "n"x"n" matrix ring over a local serial ring. Such rings are also known as primary decomposable serial rings .

Georgia v. South Carolina (1990)

Georgia v. South Carolina, is one of a long series of U.S. Supreme Court cases determining the borders of the state of Georgia. In this case, the Court decided the exact border within the Savannah River and whether islands should be a part of Georgia or South Carolina. It also decided the seaward border.
Background.
In 1787, the two states agreed in the Treaty of Beaufort that the boundary along the Savannah River was the river's "most northern branch or stream," "reserving all islands in river to Georgia". In a subsequent 1922 Supreme Court decision, also called "Georgia v. South Carolina", 257 U. S. 516, also held that all islands in the river belong to Georgia, but that the border should be in the middle of the river between the two shores, with the border half way between any island and the South Carolina shore.
Since the 1922 case, a number of new islands were created in the river between the city of Savannah and the ocean, due to the deposit of dredging spoilage or the natural deposit of sediments. In some cases, the new islands were on the South Carolina side of the previously drawn boundary, and Georgia claimed that once a new island emerged, the border should be moved to the midpoint between the new island and the South Carolina shore of the river. In some cases, the state of South Carolina had been collecting property tax from the land owners and policing the land in question for a number of years.
When an island causes the border to leave the middle of the river, it raises the question as to how the border line should return to the middle of the river at each end of the island. South Carolina advocated a right angle bend at each tip of the island, while Georgia advocated a "triequidistant" method which kept the border an equal distance between the two shores and the tip of the island (resulting in a smooth curve.)
The Savannah River north of Elba Island was particularly wide, and the Army Corps of Engineers built a training wall to narrow the channel to prevent it from filling up with silt. The Corps also filled the area behind the training wall with dredging spoilage. Both South Carolina and Georgia claimed the land that was created behind the training wall, even though it was on the South Carolina side of the river. This new land was called "Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal".
Given the valuable natural resources off the Atlantic Ocean shore, the two states also contested where the off-shore boundary between the two states is located. The typical procedure would be to locate the mouth of the Savannah River and then draw a line perpendicular to the shore from the midpoint of the river's mouth. However, the river does not have a clearly defined mouth. Tybee Island forms the southern edge of its mouth, but there is no highlands on the opposite side. South Carolina claimed that a submerged shoal formed the north side of the mouth, while Georgia claimed that Hilton Head Island was the north side of the mouth. The issue is complicated by a bend in the Atlantic coast at this point with Georgia's coast about 20 degrees from true north and South Carolina's coast about 47 degrees from true north. A perpendicular line drawn from each of these angles results in an overlapping 27 degree wedge claimed by both states.
In 1978, the Court appointed Walter E. Hoffman, Senior Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, as special master to gather the facts and make a recommendation.
Opinion.
Justice Blackmun delivered the majority opinion and held that the new island on the South Carolina side of the border belonged to that state rather than Georgia. Georgia had lost the right to that land through prescription and acquiescence. The Court also ruled that any new islands emerging after the border was drawn would not cause the border to automatically shift so as to place the island in Georgia. The Court also adopted Georgia's "triequidistant" method for determining the boundary around the existing islands, resulting in the border line curving around those islands.
The Court awarded Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal to Georgia because its creation was "primarily avulsive in nature." The Court also placed the newly emerged Bird Island in Georgia. The Court also set a compromise seaward boundary drawing it perpendicular to a line between Tybee Island and Hilton Head.
Justice White with Justice Marshall dissented in part. They would draw the boundary at islands at right angles to the tips of the islands back to the middle of the river.
Justice Stevens with Justice Scalia dissented from the seaward boundary portion of the opinion. This opinion would average the angles of the Georgia and South Carolina coast lines and draw the boundary at an azimuth of this boundary would be approximately 123 1/2 degrees.
Justice Scalia with Justice Kennedy dissented from the Denwill and Horseshoe Shoal portion of the opinion and would place that land in South Carolina.
Justice Kennedy with Justice Rehnquist dissented from the portions of the opinion finding that newly formed islands belong in whatever state has that portion of the river. Kennedy reads the Treaty as giving all islands to Georgia, so Kennedy would place them in Georgia unless they were lost by prescription and acquiescence. Accordingly, Kennedy agrees with the majority that the Barnwell Islands belong to South Carolina.
One history text described the case, "In 1990 the United States Supreme Court awarded South Carolina 7,000 acres of water and 3,000 acres of land along the Savannah River, increasing the size of the state by four and a half square miles."

LGBT rights in Rhode Island

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in the U.S. state of Rhode Island have the same legal protections as heterosexuals. Rhode Island established two lots of major relationship recognition for same-sex couples - starting with civil unions for same-sex couples only since July 1, 2011. Then since August 1, 2013 with same-sex marriage. 
State-sanctioned discrimination.
Sexual acts between consenting adults in private have been legal in Rhode Island since anti-sodomy statutes were repealed in 1998.
Recognition of same-sex relationships.
Rhode Island now grants marriage licenses to same-sex couples since August 1, 2013. On February 20, 2007, Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch issued an opinion holding that same-sex marriages performed in Massachusetts would be recognized in Rhode Island. He said that "his interpretation permitted recognition of the marriages, although he acknowledged that it was just an opinion and did not have the force of law." On May 14, 2012, Gov. Chafee issued an executive ordering directing state agencies to treat same-sex marriages performed out-of-state as the equivalent of marriage. On September 21, 2012, the state's Division of Taxation, ruling in an estate tax case, announced it would treat couples in same-sex marriages or civil unions established in other jurisdictions as legally married, basing its decision on the state's civil unions law and the state's tradition of recognizing marriages validly performed elsewhere.
Rhode Island has provided benefits to same-sex partners of state employees since 2001.
A bill to legalize same-sex marriage was introduced in the legislature on January 11, 2011. Governor Lincoln Chafee announced his support for it. In May 2011, a bill to legalize civil unions for same-sex couples was introduced. It passed the Rhode Island House by a vote of 62-11. It passed the Senate on June 29 by a vote of 21 to 16. Gov. Chafee signed the legislation on July 2, 2011 and the law was made effective from July 1, 2011. As of January 2013, only 68 couples obtained civil union licenses.
Legislation establishing same-sex marriage in Rhode Island was enacted in May 2013, effective August 1. Beginning on August 1, two persons who are parties to a civil union entered into before that date may convert their union into a marriage.
Adoption and parenting.
The Rhode Island Family Court routinely grants same sex couple adoptions and has been doing so since at least 1995.

Khaos Legions

Khaos Legions is the eighth studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band Arch Enemy. It was released on May 30, 2011 by Century Media. The record marks a return to new, original material, after releasing the "Tyrants of the Rising Sun - Live in Japan" live CD/DVD (2008) and "The Root of All Evil" (2009) which consisted of a selection of re-recorded songs from the band's back catalog. It is the band's ninth album counting the compilation.
"Khaos Legions" debuted at number 78 on the Billboard 200, selling around 6,000 copies. This surpasses both "Doomsday Machine" and "Rise of the Tyrant", making it the band's highest-charting effort so far.
The album's single is "Yesterday is Dead and Gone", and music videos have been released for "Yesterday is Dead and Gone", "Bloodstained Cross", "Under Black Flags We March" and "Cruelty Without Beauty". This would be the band's last album with original member Christopher Amott before he parted ways with the band for the second time in March 2012, to be replaced by former Arsis guitarist Nick Cordle. Also the last album with vocalist Angela Gossow before she stepped down as vocalist in March 2014, to be replaced by Alissa White-Gluz.
Lyrically the album focuses on various political and social themes like religion in the song "Bloodstained Cross", animal testing in "Cruelty Without Beauty" and anarchism in the songs "No Gods, No Masters" and "Under Black Flags We March" (the black flag is an anarchist symbol). Animal testing was also criticized in the video for the song "Cruelty Without Beauty" showing video footage from animal test laboratories.
Background and development.
The album was produced by Arch Enemy and Rickard Bengtsson, who had previously worked with the band on their 2005 album Doomsday Machine. Recording sessions took place at the Sweet Spot Studio, Sweden. The mix was done by Andy Sneap in Derbyshire, England.
Drummer Daniel Erlandsson said about the album:
In January 2011, UK’s Bonkers Entertainment caught up with the band at their headline show at the HMV Forum in London UK on November 27, 2010. This concert was the last stop on a three-year-long touring cycle for the “Rise Of The Tyrant” and “The Root Of All Evil” albums and in the interview the members of Arch Enemy discussed the upcoming recording of the new studio album, the song writing process and touring plans for 2011. During the conversation, the band also divulged the title of the new album to be “Khaos Legions”.
Release and concept.
Behind-the-scenes footage from the recording sessions for "Khaos Legions" leaked onto the internet and can be seen at the band's YouTube channel. The CD was tracked at Sweet Spot Studio in the south of Sweden with engineer Rickard Bengtsson (who produced 2005's "Doomsday Machine") and is scheduled for a May release via Century Media Records. The band's drummer Daniel Erlandsson previously stated about the new CD, "We had a very inspiring and creative time writing this album. I think this is definitely evident when listening to the new songs. There's tons of variation in the material, ranging all the way from very melodic to extremely heavy."
In the band's second studio update, bassist Sharlee D'Angelo said: "Ladies and gentlemen, the low end is firmly in place! After a long day of plowing through an absolutely massive array of bass guitars, different amps and cabs, and various other electronic gadgets, the choice finally fell on my white custom shop Ibanez Iceman run through an MXR Bass D.I.+ and an Aguilar Tonehammer into an Aguilar DB751 head and a DB810 cab, complemented by a Marshall VBC 412 cab, hidden behind a veritable forest of expensive microphones on serious looking mic stands. And the result? F**king awesome, people! Our engineer Rickard Bengtsson is an audio nerd with a rock’n'roll backbone who does not give up until he finds what he’s looking for – and thank f**k for that. Cause the songs on this album really need to be presented in the best way possible. Having laid down all the bass tracks now I just can’t wait for everybody to hear the album, and to play all these songs live for you all! But we’re not quite there yet, next up are blistering leads from the depths of hell"
Artwork.
The artwork for this album was created by Brent Elliott White, and features a photo of the band cartooned in skeletons. According to Angela Gossow, it was inspired by Eugène Delacroix's "Liberty Leading the People".
Promotion.
Arch Enemy has confirmed several 2011 summer dates and festivals in support of the forthcoming album, including newly added performances on Sonisphere Festivals in Sweden, UK and Spain.

Martin Alhaja was a Spanish shepherd who aided the Castilian King Alfonso VIII during the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 A.D. Alhaja, who knew the area, to herd his sheep had placed a cow skull on the path that led to the field behind the Moors and onto the battlefield. The Spanish Christian King surprised the Moorish army and defeated them. This was the first significant victory for the Christian Spanish during their reconquest of Spain.
For his assistance, King Alfonso VIII gave Alhaja the title "Cabeza de Vaca", which means "head of a cow". He was awarded a coat-of-arms that included cow skulls in its design.

Emma May Vilardi

Emma May Vilardi (née Sutton; June 23, 1922 – July 9, 1990)
Emma was born Emma May Sutton in Kansas City, Missouri in 1922 and died in Carson City, Nevada in 1990.
Emma authored "Heritage and Legacy: Town of Kearney, New Jersey" in 1967 and a booklet titled "Handbook for the Search" in 1973 which was originally distributed to members of ALMA Society and then later by TRIADOPTION® Publications. She also wrote a number of unpublished children’s stories.
Early career.
In 1975, she founded the International Soundex Reunion Registry, Inc. (ISRR) as a free mutual consent registry serving adoptees, foster children and others separated from birth family. This registry was supported by Emma and her husband Tony for many years. They saved all the donations until they were able to purchase the first computer and then the building in Carson City, Nevada which housed the registry until 2007. Emma was survived by her husband, son Ed, sister Pat and many nieces, nephews and grandchildren. In addition, Emma served as a mentor to many, with her expertise in genealogy research utilized to assist persons seeking reunion with family from whom they had been separated. She served on the planning committees which created the American Adoption Congress (AAC) and was an original signer to the 1981 incorporation. She was also involved in and served on the advisory board of TRIADOPTION Library and other movement organizations.
Dear Abby.
Dear Abby wrote a number of responses referring her readers to ISRR beginning in 1983, because after speaking with Emma many times, Abigail VanBuren was supportive of the neutral position the registry provided. Mrs. Vilardi was involved with the offices of Senator Carl Levin in his numerous attempts to create a federally support registry.
Adoption reform.
Emma May was among those pioneers of adoption reform whose influence is broader than often recognized. In her honor, the AAC has given the "Emma Vilardi Humanitarian Award" annually since 1991.
Legacy.
Emma created many of the forms and letters still utilized in search today. Maybe most widely used are versions of her “Waiver of Confidentiality”. The ISRR website has many of those original creations and even some in her handwriting. (www.isrr.net) . Her name is mentioned in newsletters and articles of the 1979’s and 80’s (see www.triadoption.com “Newsletters” or “Articles”). Emma’s legacy is many things, but most of all the tens of thousands of individuals who have been reunited because of her insight, commitment and vision.

Syrian Republic (1930–1958)

The Syrian Republic ( "Al-Jumhūriyyah Al-Sūriyyah"; ) was formed in 1930 as a component of the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon, succeeding the State of Syria. A treaty of independence was made in 1936 to grant independence to Syria and end official French rule, but the French parliament refused to accept the agreement. From 1940 to 1941, the Syrian Republic was under the control of Vichy France, and upon liberation in 1941 became a sovereign state. In 1958, Syria joined with Egypt in forming the United Arab Republic.
French Mandate prior to the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence.
The project of a new constitution was discussed by a Constituent Assembly elected in April 1928, but as the pro-independence National Bloc had won a majority and insisted on the insertion of several articles "that did not preserve the prerogatives of the mandatary power", the Assembly was dissolved on August 9, 1928. On May 14, 1930, the State of Syria was declared the Republic of Syria and a new Syrian constitution was promulgated by the French High Commissioner, in the same time as the Lebanese Constitution, the "Règlement du Sandjak d'Alexandrette", the Statute of the Alawi Government, the Statute of the Jabal Druze State. A new flag was also mentioned in this constitution:
During December 1931 and January 1932, the first elections under the new constitution were held, under an electoral law providing for "the representation of religious minorities" as imposed by article 37 of the constitution. The National Bloc was in the minority in the new Chamber of deputies with only 16 deputies out of 70, due to intensive vote-rigging by the French authorities. Among the deputies were also three members of the Syrian Kurdish nationalist Xoybûn (Khoyboun) party, Khalil bey Ibn Ibrahim Pacha (Al-Jazira province), Mustafa bey Ibn Shahin (Jarabulus) and Hassan Aouni (Kurd Dagh). There were later in the year, from March 30 to April 6, "complementary elections".
In 1933, France attempted to impose a treaty of independence heavily prejudiced in favor of France. It promised gradual independence but kept the Syrian Mountains under French control. The Syrian head of state at the time was a French puppet, Muhammad 'Ali Bay al-'Abid. Fierce opposition to this treaty was spearheaded by senior nationalist and parliamentarian Hashim al-Atassi, who called for a sixty day strike in protest. Atassi's political coalition, the National Bloc, mobilized massive popular support for his call. Riots and demonstrations raged, and the economy came to a standstill.
Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence.
After negotiations in March with Damien de Martel, the French High Commissioner in Syria, Hashim al-Atassi went to Paris heading a senior Bloc delegation. The new Popular Front-led French government, formed in June 1936 after the April–May elections, had agreed to recognize the National Bloc as the sole legitimate representatives of the Syrian people and invited al-Atassi to independence negotiations. The resulting treaty called for immediate recognition of Syrian independence as a sovereign republic, with full emancipation granted gradually over a 25 year period.
In 1936, the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence was signed, a treaty that would not be ratified by the French legislature. However, the treaty allowed Jabal Druze, the Alawite (now called Latakia), and Alexandretta to be incorporated into the Syrian republic within the following two years. Greater Lebanon (now the Lebanese Republic) was the only state that did not join the Syrian Republic. Hashim al-Atassi, who was Prime Minister under King Faisal's brief reign (1918–1920), was the first president to be elected under a new constitution adopted after the independence treaty.
The treaty guaranteed incorporation of previously autonomous Druze and Alawite regions into Greater Syria, but not Lebanon, with which France signed a similar treaty in November. The treaty also promised curtailment of French intervention in Syrian domestic affairs as well as a reduction of French troops, personnel and military bases in Syria. In return, Syria pledged to support France in times of war, including the use of its air space, and to allow France to maintain two military bases on Syrian territory. Other political, economic and cultural provisions were included.
Atassi returned to Syria in triumph on September 27, 1936 and was elected President of the Republic in November.
In September 1938, France again separated the Syrian Sanjak of Alexandretta and transformed it into the State of Hatay. The State of Hatay joined Turkey in the following year, in June 1939. Syria did not recognize the incorporation of Hatay into Turkey and the issue is still disputed until the present time.
The emerging threat of Adolf Hitler induced a fear of being outflanked by Nazi Germany if France relinquished its colonies in the Middle East. That, coupled with lingering imperialist inclinations in some levels of the French government, led France to reconsider its promises and refuse to ratify the treaty. Also, France ceded the Sanjak of Alexandretta, whose territory was guaranteed as part of Syria in the treaty, to Turkey. Riots again broke out, Atassi resigned, and Syrian independence was deferred until after World War II.
World War II and aftermath.
With the fall of France in 1940 during World War II, Syria came under the control of the Vichy Government until the British and Free French invaded and occupied the country in July 1941. Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941 but it wasn't until 1 January 1944, that it was recognized as an independent republic.
In the 1940s, Britain secretly advocated the creation of a Greater Syrian state that would secure Britain preferential status in military, economic and cultural matters, in return for putting a complete halt to Jewish ambition in Palestine. France and the United States opposed British hegemony in the region, which eventually led to the creation of Israel.
On 27 September 1941, France proclaimed, by virtue of, and within the framework of the Mandate, the independence and sovereignty of the Syrian State. The proclamation said "the independence and sovereignty of Syria and Lebanon will not affect the juridical situation as it results from the Mandate Act. Indeed, this situation could be changed only with the agreement of the Council of the League of Nations, with the consent of the Government of the United States, a signatory of the Franco-American Convention of April 4, 1924, and only after the conclusion between the French Government and the Syrian and Lebanese Governments of treaties duly ratified in accordance with the laws of the French Republic.
Benqt Broms said that it was important to note that there were several founding members of the United Nations whose statehood was doubtful at the time of the San Francisco Conference and that the Government of France still considered Syria and Lebanon to be mandates.
Duncan Hall said "Thus, the Syrian mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the League or its successor. The mandate was terminated by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: 'The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality.'"
On 29 May 1945, France bombed Damascus and tried to arrest its democratically elected leaders. While French planes were bombing Damascus, Prime Minister Faris al-Khoury was at the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco, presenting Syria's claim for independence from the French Mandate.
Continuing pressure from Syrian nationalist groups and British pressure forced the French to evacuate their last troops on 17 April 1946.
Independence.
Syrian independence was acquired in 1946. Although rapid economic development followed the declaration of independence, Syrian politics from independence through the late 1960s was marked by upheaval. The early years of independence were marked by political instability.
In 1948, Syria was involved in the Arab-Israeli War with the newly created State of Israel. The Syrian army was pressed out of the Israeli areas, but fortified their strongholds on the Golan and managed to keep their old borders and occupy some additional territory. In July 1949, Syria was the last Arab country to sign an armistice agreement with Israel.
On 29 March 1949, Syria's national government was overthrown by a military coup d'état led by Hussni al-Zaim. Later that year, on 14 August 1949, Zaim was overthrown by his colleague Sami al-Hinnawi. A few months later, in December 1949, Hinnawi was overthrown by Colonel Adib al-Shishakli. The latter undermined civilian rule and led to Shishakli's complete seizure of power in 1951. Shishakli continued to rule the country until 1954, when growing public opposition forced him to resign and leave the country. The national government was restored, but again to face instability, this time coming from abroad. After the overthrow of President Shishakli in the February 1954 coup, continued political maneuvering supported by competing factions in the military eventually brought Arab nationalist and socialist elements to power. From 1946 to 1956, Syria had 20 different cabinets and drafted four separate constitutions.
During the Suez Crisis of 1956, after the invasion of the Sinai Peninsula by Israeli troops, and the intervention of British and French troops, martial law was declared in Syria. Later Syrian and Iraqi troops were brought into Jordan to prevent a possible Israeli invasion. The November 1956 attacks on Iraqi pipelines were in retaliation for Iraq's acceptance into the Baghdad Pact. In early 1957 Iraq advised Egypt and Syria against a conceivable takeover of Jordan.
In November 1956, Syria signed a pact with the Soviet Union, providing a foothold for Communist influence within the government in exchange for planes, tanks, and other military equipment being sent to Syria. This increase in the strength of Syrian military technology worried Turkey, as it seemed feasible that Syria might attempt to retake Iskenderon, a formerly Syrian city now in Turkey. On the other hand, Syria and the USSR accused Turkey of massing its troops at the Syrian border. During this standoff, Communists gained more control over the Syrian government and military. Only heated debates in the United Nations (of which Syria was an original member) lessened the threat of war.
Syria's political instability during the years after the 1954 coup, the parallelism of Syrian and Egyptian policies, and the appeal of Egyptian President Gamal Abdal Nasser's leadership in the wake of the Suez crisis created support in Syria for union with Egypt. On February 1, 1958, Syrian president Shukri al-Kuwatli and Nasser announced the merging of the two countries, creating the United Arab Republic, and all Syrian political parties, as well as the Communists therein, ceased overt activities.

Outset Media

Outset Media Corporation is a Canadian company which develops and distributes family entertainment products, specializing in board games, party games, card games, and jigsaw puzzles. In addition to developing its own games, Outset Media also distributes games and puzzles in Canada for United States-based companies.
History.
The company was founded in 1996 by 23-year old university student David Manga, originally with the sole purpose of publishing and distributing a single board game called All Canadian Trivia. Development of the product was 16 months. The original edition of All Canadian Trivia was released in May 1997. While the Original edition went on to become a Canadian bestseller - breaking 100,000 copies sold in Canada, the French edition was a flop and sold less than 3,000 copies.
A limited print-run Millennium Edition of All Canadian Trivia was released in 1999. The game's creator embarked on a two-month guerilla marketing campaign across Canada to promote the game. David Manga was selected as one of a hundred young Canadians to watch in the new millennium by Maclean's magazine.
In 2002, Outset Media nearly closed its doors after its largest customer, Stewart House Publishing, a former gift division of book publisher McClelland & Stewart, ran into financial difficulties and went into bankruptcy. With nearly 50% of its annual revenue in bad debt and unrecoverable, Outset Media was bailed out with angel investments from family members and financing from the Royal Bank of Canada. Later that year, Outset Media added a new division, distributing other companies' games in Canada, when it began to distribute the line of "opoly" games from US-based Late for the Sky.
In 2003, Outset Media made its first appearance on the Profit magazine's annual ranking of Canada's Fastest-Growing Companies. The company would appear on the Profit 100 list for six consecutive years from 2003 to 2008.
Professor Noggin's.
Outset Media's most recognized brand is the Professor Noggin's series of educational card games. First published in 2002, the series now includes 39 different titles, and has garnered 14 international toy awards to date. Over 800,000 copies have been sold worldwide, and the series has been translated into French as "Professeur Caboche".
Cobble Hill Puzzles.
Cobble Hill Puzzle Co is the sister company of Outset Media. The Cobble Hill brand is exclusively distributed by Outset Media. Cobble Hill big box puzzles are wholly made in the USA. The jigsaw puzzle, box board, and shrink film is 100% recyclable and the brand is considered environmentally friendly meeting all CONEG requirements, as well as meet or exceed all requirements by CPSIA.

Internationalist–defencist schism

The terms internationalist and defencist were commonly used to describe the broad opposing camps in the international socialist movement during and shortly after the First World War. Prior to 1914, anti-militarism had been an article of faith among most European socialist parties. Leaders of the Second International had even suggested that socialist workers might foil a declaration of war by means of a general strike.
However, when war broke out in August 1914, the leaders of most European socialist parties rallied to the support of their respective countries, while a minority continued to oppose the war. Those in favour of their country's war efforts were variously called 'social patriots' or 'defencists'. Those opposed to the war called themselves 'Internationalists' and were often called 'defeatists' by their opponents.
Division.
The 'defencist' camp included many venerable figures of European socialism: Jules Guesde and Édouard Vaillant in France, Gustav Noske and Friedrich Ebert in Germany, Georgi Plekhanov and Ekaterina Breshkovskaia among the Russians. Leaders of the anti-war 'Internationalist' camp included Jean Jaurès (who was murdered for his anti-war stance in 1914), Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, and later also Karl Kautsky and Eduard Bernstein, in Germany, Iulii Martov, Vladimir Lenin, Viktor Chernov and Mark Natanson among the Russians. The anti-war socialists held two international conferences at Zimmerwald and Kienthal in Switzerland in 1915 and 1916.
The defencist–internationalist schism did not necessarily coincide with earlier, pre-existing splits, such as that between reformists and revolutionaries, Revisionists and orthodox Marxists, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, etc. For example, Guesde and Vaillant in France had belonged to the intransigent, revolutionary left of the Socialist Party, and in 1914, anti-war sentiment was strongest on the far left. Yet both of these veterans were ardent supporters of the French war effort, while the old reformist leader Jaurès opposed the war. Likewise, Kautsky and Bernstein had been on opposite sides during the Revisionism controversy of the 1890s, Kautsky defending orthodox Marxism and Bernstein being the principal exponent of Revisionism; they both joined the anti-war faction.
'Defencism' and 'Internationalism' were broad categories; within each camp, there were further differences and divisions. Out-and-out 'Social Patriots' who supported their countries' war efforts unconditionally, including territorial ambitions, were fairly rare, though they included some of the most prominent representatives of the pre-war socialist movement: people like Henry Hyndman, Plekhanov and Guesde. More common was an attitude of conditional support for the war, approving a 'defensive' war but rejecting annexations and indemnities. A special case arose in Russia in 1917: After the February Revolution, several Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries (SRs) who had previously been Internationalists and Zimmerwaldists now favoured 'Revolutionary Defencism' – continued war effort in defence of the revolution. This was the case with Mensheviks like Fedor Dan and Irakli Tsereteli, SRs like Avram Gots and Nikolai Avksentiev and Trudoviks like Alexander Kerensky. In 1917 even some Bolsheviks took this position, before Lenin returned to Russia and rectified matters. On the Internationalist side, too, there were divisions. Most Internationalists favoured passive resistance to the war and called for an international peace agreement, 'without annexations or indemnities'. Jaurès, Kautsky, Bernstein, Martov and Chernov belonged to this camp; so, at first, did the Bolshevik Lev Kamenev. A minority led by Lenin advocated 'Revolutionary Defeatism': instead of seeking a peace agreement that would restore the "status quo ante", socialists should seek to convert the 'imperialist war' into a revolutionary 'civil war', with each socialist party working for the defeat of its own country.
Effects by country.
The schism caused splits in many European socialist parties. In France, the split between socialists and communists did not occur until 1920. In Germany, the Independent Social-Democrats (USPD) formally separated from the majority Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1917, and the more radical Spartacist League formed the nucleus of the post-war German Communist Party (KPD). Italy was a special case: whereas, in most European socialist parties, Defencists predominated (at least at the beginning of the war), in Italy, the majority of the members and most of the leaders of the Socialist Party, from reformists to radicals, were against Italy's entry into the war, while a minority, led by the former Maximalist and future fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, campaigned for Italian intervention and was expelled from the party for it. Only the Serbian socialists remained fairly uniformly anti-war.
Russia.
Divisions in Russia were especially complicated and affected party alignments during the Russian Revolution. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries were badly divided. A small minority on the right took an out-and-out Social Patriotic stance, even supporting territorial expansion as a war aim. Plekhanov and the 'Grandmother of the Revolution, Breshkovskaia, belonged to this group. Slightly more moderate were Mensheviks like Aleksandr Potresov and SRs like Vadim Rudnev. The Menshevik and SR majority, including Dan, Tsereteli, Abramovich, Liber, Gots, Avksentiev, Zenzinov and so on, were 'Revolutionary Defencists'; they had been Zimmerwaldists and opponents of the war until February 1917 but now favoured limited defensive war.
Some later returned to the Internationalist camp (such as Dan and Abramovich). The Revolutionary Defencists dominated the soviets and the Provisional Government until the October Revolution of 1917. The Menshevik/SR Revolutionary Defencists in the soviet supported the Provisional Government, but with increasing misgivings. Kerensky had been one of them, a Zimmerwaldist until 1917, then a Revolutionary Defencist; however, as, initially, the only socialist in the Provisional Government, he had adopted a more and more unqualified stance in support of the war, in line with his liberal colleagues.
To the left of the revolutionary defencists stood Internationalists like Chernov, who collaborated with the soviet leaders and even joined the Provisional Government, although he opposed both a continuation of the war and a coalition with the liberals. More principled in his opposition to the war was the Menshevik Internationalist leader Martov, who, however, was in a minority in his party until the Bolsheviks had taken power. The Mezhraiontsy group, headed by Leon Trotsky, was firmly internationalist but not necessarily revolutionary defeatist; in 1918, Trotsky resigned his ministry rather than sign the harsh peace agreement of Brest-Litovsk proposed by the Germans.
The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who counted the veteran Mark Natanson and many young militants among their number, were also firmly Internationalist but broke their short-lived coalition with the Bolsheviks when the latter signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Bolsheviks were fairly united in opposing the war, but not all Bolsheviks were comfortable with Lenin's Revolutionary Defeatism. Before Lenin's return to Russia, Joseph Stalin had even briefly adopted a Revolutionary Defencist position. Divisions over the war vitiated the attempts occasionally made, both before and after the October Revolution, to set up an all-socialist government, from the Bolsheviks to the Popular Socialists.
Post-war impact.
After World War I was over, divisions over the war could not be healed. Many internationalists wanted nothing to do with the Defencist leaders of the old Second International. Some affiliated with Lenin's communist Third International. A minority, who opposed both communism and the Second International leadership, formed the International Working Union of Socialist Parties, based in Vienna and known as the 'Second-and-a-Half International'. This included many former Internationalists, German Independent Social-Democrats like Rudolf Hilferding, Austro-Marxists like Max and Friedrich Adler, Mensheviks like Dan, centre-left SRs like Chernov and the Left SRs. Eventually this third camp dissolved; some rejoined the majority socialist parties of their countries, others the communists. The split between Defencists and Internationalists continued to fester, however, until the Second World War was on the horizon.
A belated echo of the split was the division among French socialists in the late 1930s over what attitude to take if Hitler invaded Poland. Most French socialists were firmly anti-fascist; though none contemplated the prospect of another war with Germany with joy, they were prepared to take that step if Germany attacked Poland. A minority, however, wanted to maintain peace at any cost. Some were motivated by unconditional pacifism, others by fascist sympathies which subsequently manifested themselves, as in the case of the ex-socialist and future premier of the Vichy régime, Pierre Laval.

The Defencist/Internationalist split over World War I is discussed in virtually all histories of socialism, communism, anarchism, particular socialist parties or the biographies of socialist personalities then living.

Quarmer

Quarmer, a.k.a. Sand Superman, is a fictional character from DC Comics, created by Denny O'Neil and Curt Swan. He was a living sand doppelganger of Superman and first appeared in Superman (Vol. 1) # 233 January 1971 in The Sandman Saga, the first issue that introduced the Bronze Age-era Superman.
Fictional origin.
Somewhere in the deserts of the USA used to be an experimental reactor in which experiments were conducted upon pieces of Kryptonite. When a powerful nuclear meltdown happened Superman himself was there to attempt to stop it. He failed, however, and a powerful kryptonite-based explosion that rendered Superman unconscious resulted. Although he apparently had succeeded in stopping most of the deadly radiation to reach humanity a strange fission wave reached around the world and changed all kryptonite into pure iron. Miraculously, it seemed, Superman now had no vulnerabilities anymore, a fact that was seen in papers world-wide.
On the spot Superman had been lying in the desert unconscious after the explosion was formed the imprint of the Man of Steel. The explosion had mysteriously opened up a portal into another dimension called the Quarrm Dimension. In that dimension beings existed as non-corporeal spirits and like most spirits they wanted a physical form to accompany them. One of the beings of that dimension gained access to the ordinary DC Earth by attaching itself to the psychic and physical imprint of Superman left in the sand. Many hours after the explosion an uncanny version of Superman, made of sand, rose from the imprint.
This being would in the months that followed meet Superman seemingly randomly and drain power from him in an attempt to create an identity for itself. Superman was left near powerless after each such encounter while the Sand Superman grew more and more powerful and humanoid. Its presence became more and more of an annoyance to Superman who wanted to know what it was. It could, however not speak, and mostly left more mysterious than it had been before the encounter. Superman, powerless at those occasions, was unable to follow it.
During one of these encounters it saved the life of Superman by destroying the magic weapon called the Devil's Harp, an artifact that was being used by a man named Ferlin Nyxly aka Pan. Pan had nearly killed Superman when the Sand Superman sneaked by and destroyed the weapon that had allowed Pan to steal all of Superman's powers. Reasonably, the Sand Superman saved Superman's life in order to maintain its own existence (he had a life-giving mental link to Superman and thus it couldn't survive without Superman being alive). Later it gained the ability to speak, but that didn't help Superman much. The being didn't follow human emotions and didn't care for humanity ; thus Superman couldn't convince it to agree on anything.
When the situation got even worse, Superman was left completely without powers. Seeking help from one of Wonder Woman's old friends, the Asian mystic called I-Ching, Superman hoped to cure his situation. I-Ching sent away Superman's soul to regain all the powers he had lost, which it did, leaving the Sand Superman powerless and near dead. Attempting to return home to Quarrm in order to survive the Sand Superman opened up a dimensional portage in a park in Metropolis. Too weak to enter the portage, the portage remained open. Superman had, unfortunately, been given a brain damage by a powerful blow to his head while unpowered. When his powers had now returned he retained the brain damage which made him act rashly and unreasonably. Superman had now become an irresponsible and potentially lethal superbeing.
With kryptonite no longer available I-Ching and Wonder Woman had to decide on a risky plan to help Superman; they tracked down the Sand Superman and made an agreement with Superman to meet him so that the Sand Superman could ambush it draining all his powers. Powerless, Superman would then recover as a normal man. Before the Sand Superman could steal Superman's powers it was spotted and Superman escaped the scene. Meanwhile, another being from Quarrm had entered the Earth Dimension via the portage in the park. This being fused itself with a giant Chinese statue of a monster and began rampaging the streets. Superman accidentally flew over this creature and was completely drained of power, leaving him unconscious and powerless. Some street punks found Superman, gave him a real beating and allied themselves with the Chinese monster Quarrmian. The monster seeking advice did everything the punks asked of it. They wanted to finish off Superman, who was now residing in a hospital, and thus went there sitting on the back of the monster.
The punks were, however, too bullying and the enraged monster killed both of them crushing them in its hands. The monster still wanted to finish Superman (to which he also seemed to have a mental link), but by the time it reached the hospital Superman awoke repowered. The Sand Superman showed up and teamed with Superman. Together they both attacked the monster who terrified escaped back into the park and left Earth via the dimensional port. Alone again with Superman, the Sand Superman announced that he was going to kill Superman so that he could be the only Man of Steel (see Quote). I-Ching, fortunately, arrived on the scene and magically hypnotized both into seeing how a fight between the two might turn out. Both saw the fight destroying the Earth and Superman, believing that he had really destroyed the Earth, was devastated. The Sand Superman realized that it had no right to claim Superman's soul or body and thus agreed on returning home to Quarrm. It left through the portage with half of Superman's powers (Superman refused to take them back after having seen the destruction of the Earth during the hypnotism) and closed the port from the Quarrm side.
Long after that he was seen in an issue of DC Collector's Edition Superman vs Shazam. The Sand Superman was impersonating the real Man of Steel and attacked Captain Marvel, while Black Adam pretended to be Marvel and ambushed Superman. All to bring about a battle between the two heroes. Presumably the Sand Superman returned to the Quarrm Dimension after the matter was settled. He has probably not been seen since...
After this history, more kryptonite rained down on Earth later on, so the effect was only temporary.
Description.
The Sand Superman resembled Superman himself more and more the more power it absorbed. At first it was a pile of sand with humanoid features, but near the end it had acquired colors in its densely packed sand so it really resembled Superman. The only real difference was that the Sand Superman had a very different and alien body language and that his skin and suit resembled rough sandpaper. Everywhere Superman had colors in his suit, it had too; it even had blue eyes of blue sand and black sand for hair. The entire appearance was quite uncanny and people who saw it often commented how strange 'Superman' looked. All in all, it has the exact appearance of Superman himself, but with a very sand-like composition.
The Sand Superman's personality is very strange and alien. Its main driving force seemed to be pure survival for which it would do anything. In time it had also gotten some of Superman's own personality including the desire to help humans and be a hero. It desired uniqueness nearly as much as survival itself, and would in the end kill Superman (something Superman wouldn't do) to take his place. In speech it was sometimes very aggressive, intimidating, while other times it could be filled with self-pitying (particularly if powerless). It was very stoic and never showed any human emotion. Its logic was non-human and uncomprehensive.
While claiming that it wanted to take Superman's place it didn't really care about what happened to humans or the Earth. Only the final realization of what was right and what was wrong led it to leave Earth and its claims to be Superman. Since it hasn't gotten back from Quarrm it has also shown a great belief in its judgement and a great persistence.
Inspiration.
Back in 1971, DC heralded a big change coming to the Superman comics, and it was Denny O'Neil who would be penning the newest chapter in the Man of Steel's history. The idea was to strip Superman of some of his power, humanizing him in the process and allowing for a new level of "realistic" (relatively speaking) storytelling. His story, which kicked off with "Kryptonite Nevermore" but has been nicknamed "The Sandman Superman Saga," is about to be published as a hardcover edition by DC.
The result of the fight between Superman and Quarmer implies that the Man of Steel was devoid of a half of his power, but later writers would gradually reintroduce Superman's Silver Age powers. This fallacy could imply other kryptonian characters, as Krypto and Supergirl, could have also infinite power, and not similar but minor power levels in relation to Superman.
Powers and abilities.
Quarmer could drain the Superman powers and use it, becoming gradually a Superman clone. He too could sense the whereabouts of Superman.

The Manxman (novel)

The Manxman is an 1894 novel by the Manx writer Hall Caine. A highly popular novel of its period, it was set in the Isle of Man and concerned a romantic triangle. The novel has as its central themes, the mounting consequences of sin and the saving grace of simple human goodness.
Plot Summary.
Part I
Part III So Pete determines to leave the island again, divorcing Kate before he goes and leaving Philip with the child and his best wishes. Philip then overcomes his final temptation, to take up the position of Governor, and confesses everything publically and so unburdes himself. The final scene sees him retrieving Kate from prison to start life afresh.
Style.
The novel is notable for its regular use of Manx dialect in speech. Peter Quilliam and the majority of the smaller characters in the novel speak in a colloquial manner unique to the Isle of Man, rendered truthfully in the novel through unusual spellings, unusual grammatical structure and even occasional Manx Gaelic words and phrases (all of which are explained in the text). An example of such a section of dialogue is as follows:
Reception.
The Manxman was one of Hall Caine's greatest successes, selling over half a million copies by 1913 and being translated into twelve languages. It was also the fourth-best selling book in the United States in 1895.
It was well received by critics and the public figures of the day. The Editor of The Scotsman called it "the most powerful story that has been written in the present generation. It is a work of genius."
T. P. O'Connor wrote that "The author of "The Manxman" belongs to the great elect of literature." This view was also shared by the Prime Minister, Lord Rosebery, who observed of the novel that "It will rank with the great works of English literature".
It helped to establish the Isle of Man as one of the literary landscapes of Britain.
The novel created something of a sensation on the Isle of Man, though opinions on it were generally of outrage. This reception was enjoyed by Caine's friend, the Manx national poet, T. E. Brown, as can be seen in his letters:
“The island is all in a shiver about Hall Caine. 'Worse than Tess!' so they say. Ladies can't admit that they read "The Manxman".”
"Take "The Manxman" as a rapture, not a reality. It is not Manx or anything else that 'savours of the realty.' As well ask for a map of Prospero's Isle as a picture of the Isle of Man from "The Manxman". Don't bother about that. Surrender yourself to the hurly-burly of splendour and get carried away, God knows where! [...] The dear old Manx folk are terribly puzzled, many of them quite outraged. 'Local colour' is knocked to smithereens (glorious smithereens!), anachronism runs riot [...]. Read and enjoy.”
Adaptations.
The novel was adapted twice for the stage. The initial play, written by Wilson Barrett with the title "The Manxman", saw its first performance in the Grand Theatre, Leeds, on 22 August 1894, only three weeks after the publication of the book. After a regional tour, the play opened in the Shaftesbury Theatre in London with Lewis Walker in the lead role. However, it was so poorly received by the public and critics alike that it only last 13 performances.
After a correspondence with George Bernard Shaw, Hall Caine himself then wrote a second version of the play in collaboration with Louis N. Parker. This version of the play, entitled "Pete: A Drama in Four Acts" featured Parker and his wife in the lead roles and proved to be a popular success.
The novel was adapted twice for silent films. In 1917 George Loane Tucker directed "The Manxman" and in 1929 Alfred Hitchcock made "The Manxman" which was his last silent film.
Locations in the novel.
The principle locations in the novel include the following:

Before I Forget (film)

Before I forget () is a 2007 French drama film directed, written and starred in by Jacques Nolot. The film portrays the life of an aging gay man, who was a hustler in his youth, confronting old age, an empty life and a reversal of paying for sex.
Plot.
Pierre is a 58-year-old gay man who was a hustler in his youth. He is no longer considered desirable and now finds himself in the reverse position: He is the one paying for sex. He has trouble sleeping, has a coffee, and starts chain smoking. In the morning, he receives a visit from Marc, a young hustler. They have sex, but the joyless encounter ends quickly; Pierre has been HIV positive for 24 years and his various medications have affected his performance. Marc invites him to a drag club but Pierre rejects the offer because he would have to shave his mustache. 
Pierre later visits Jacques, a wealthy gay friend, who is married and has tax problems. They compare bargains on gigolos. Pierre brags that he has acquired the services of one young man for half the price that his friend paid. A trip to Pigalle for sex is curtailed because of Pierre's impotence problem. At his lawyer's, an old gay man, Pierre runs into a friend from many years ago, Paul, an ex con who has inherited money from his late lover Gaston, an ex-lover of Pierre. Paul, who was barely 17 years old when Pierre was in his prime, was having sex with the lawyer when Pierre arrived to invite him for lunch. At the restaurant, they compare crime stories: stealing things, doing time, etc. Pierre casually mentions that he used to cruise with Roland Barthes and later reflects on his now lost youth and good looks, commenting that then "Apart from sun, cock, and bars, nothing much interested me."
Toutoune, Pierre’s former older lover and patron of 35 years died recently and Pierre had been hoping to inherit some money, but no will was found and he was swindled out of his inheritance by Toutoune’s relatives. With a friend, he visits Toutoune’s house looking for some artwork that was left to him. "What would make me happy? Nothing..." he says at one point, adding that a new young lover might do the trick.
Pierre visits his psychotherapist and discusses his depression. The therapist shuts down the session just as Pierre gets going. Back home, Pierre worries that his medication, aside from warnings about liver trouble and other dangerous side effects, will make him lose his hair. Later, Pierre gives oral sex to a man who delivers his groceries, advises a young gigolo and visits his friend David. Finally he dresses in drag to visit a porn cinema with Marc.
DVD release.
The film was released on DVD in the USA in September 2008. The film is in French with English subtitles that cannot be turned off. The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (2 min), also subtitled.

Dubautia pauciflorula is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common name Wahiawa bog dubautia. It is endemic to Hawaii where it is known only from the Wahiawa Mountains on the island of Kauai. 
There are fewer than 50 individuals remaining. It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1991. Like other "Dubautia" this plant is called na`ena`e.
This member of the silversword alliance was first collected in 1909, and again in 1911, but it went without a name for many decades. It was not collected again until 1979 and it was finally described as a new species in 1981. It grows in wet rainforest habitat near streams. The area receives up to 500 centimeters of precipitation annually. This plant is a shrub growing up to 3 meters tall by 3 meters wide, with smooth, oppositely arranged leaves. Yellow flowers are borne in heads of two to four. 
Threats to this species and its habitat include feral pigs and invasive plant species such as "Melastoma candidum". Conservation efforts include the collection of seeds.

Joe Koenig

Joseph (Joe) Koenig is a Canadian entrepreneur who was founder and president of Electronics Workbench. Koenig’s first company was Interactive Image Technologies in Toronto, Ontario, and specialized in producing educational movies and documentaries. When the government of Ontario needed an educational tool for teaching electronics in colleges, the company created an electronics circuit simulator called Electronics Workbench.
Early Years.
Joe Koenig emigrated to Canada from Germany with his family in 1937, when they fled Nazi Germany. They settled in farm along the Grand River, outside what is now known as Cambridge, Ontario. 
Koenig began his career as a filmmaker in 1956 at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). He directed and produced dozens of films over his 14 1/2-year career at the NFB, including Cosmic Zoom, and The Rise and Fall of the Great Lakes. Through his work as a director and producer, Koenig began experimenting with multimedia as an educational tool. 
He left NFB in 1969 and with John Kemeny and George Kazender formed International Cinemedia Center where he produced films for Sesame Street and other educational clients in Canada and the United States. He relocated to Toronto in 1978 and transformed the company into Interactive Image Technologies in 1985, and began producing and distributing educational interactive videos. In 1992, the Ontario Government modified its high school curriculum to require the teaching of electronics. A Call for proposals to provide a simulation software package to meet the required learning outcomes was issued, and Koenig’s company was awarded the contract.
In 1995, Koenig became embroiled in a copyright lawsuit that gained international attention. He sued the operator of a website that distributed illegal copies of his software through a bulletin-board and was successful in his lawsuit, which was filed in the UK.
One of the main challenges faced by early versions of Electronics Workbench, was the reluctance of educators to use simulation software as part of their electronics curriculum. In the early 1990s, there was considerable opposition among the electronics education community regarding the use of simulation software for the delivery of electronics curriculum. Many educators felt that a “hands on” methodology was the only valid method of learning electronics, and that simulation was a less-effective substitute. 
In 1996, Koenig approached best-selling author Dr. Colin Simpson, with the idea of integrating his simulation software with Simpson’s book Principles of Electronics and to offer an Electronics technician program where the entire learning outcomes for laboratory projects would be achieved with simulation. Simpson and Koenig embarked on a series of lectures, conference presentations and meetings with accrediting organizations throughout 1996, where they demonstrated that electronics simulation software could achieve identical results to laboratory experiments performed with real equipment. 
The partnership between Koenig and Simpson led to the creation of the Electronics Technician distance education program,which became the largest electronics program in the world. The program won a National Award in 1998, and established Electronics Workbench as a leading educational resource.
In 1999, Koenig oversaw the acquisition of Ultimate Technology Inc. (UTI) located in the Netherlands. The integration of Multisim with UTI’s PCB layout and design, transformed Koenig’s company into a global Electronic Design Automation (EDA) company with an installed base of over 150,000 customers.
Later Years.
By the year 2000, Koenig’s vision of laboratory simulation software in every school was largely realized and he began to take a more passive role in the strategic planning and day-to-day operation of his company. He announced his retirement as Chief Executive Officer in 2003, and in 2005, Koenig sold his company to National Instruments.

Yukio Mishima bibliography

The bibliography of Kimitake Hiraoka, pen name Yukio Mishima, includes novels, novellas, short stories and literary essays, as well as plays that were written not only in a contemporary-style, but also in the style of classical Japanese theatre, particularly in the genres of noh and kabuki. However, although Mishima took themes, titles and characters from the noh canon, he included his own twists and modern settings, such as hospitals and ballrooms, which startled audiences who were accustomed to the long-settled originals.
In total, Mishima wrote 34 novels (including some entertainment novels), about 50 plays, 25 books of short stories, and at least 35 books of essays, one libretto, as well as one film.

Brothers in Law (TV series)

Brothers in Law is a British television series inspired by the 1955 comedy novel "Brothers in Law" by Henry Cecil Leon. It first aired on the BBC in thirteen half-hour episodes between 17 April and 10 July 1962 and followed the trials of an idealistic young lawyer entering the legal profession. The series was adapted by Frank Muir and Denis Norden, two of the most prolific sitcom writers of the era, as well as Richard Waring. 
The sitcom gave Richard Briers his first regular starring role in a television series; he also worked with writer Richard Waring and producer Graeme Muir on "Marriage Lines" in the same period. The series was also the TV debut of Yootha Joyce (in "Separation Order") and the final episode inspired a spin-off series, "Mr Justice Duncannon" featuring Andrew Cruickshank. A BBC Radio 4 adaptation featuring almost the same cast was broadcast for 39 episodes between 1970 and 1972.

<doc id="31158502" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31158502" title="Cibyrrhaeot Theme">
Cibyrrhaeot Theme

The Cibyrrhaeot Theme, more properly the Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots (), was a Byzantine theme encompassing the southern coast of Asia Minor from the early 8th to the late 12th centuries. As the Byzantine Empire's first and most important naval theme (Greek: θέμα ναυτικόν), it served chiefly to provide ships and troops for the Byzantine navy.
History.
The Cibyrrhaeots (, "men of Cibyrrha") derive their name from the city of Cibyrrha (it is unclear whether this is Cibyrrha the Great in Caria or Cibyrrha the Lesser in Pamphylia). The command first appears in the expedition against Carthage in 698, when a ""droungarios" of the Cibyrrhaeots" is attested as commanding the men from Korykos: Apsimar, who at the head of a fleet revolt became emperor as Tiberios III (r. 698–705). At the time, the Cibyrrhaeots were subordinate to the great naval corps of the "Karabisianoi".
After the "Karabisianoi" were disbanded (the exact date is disputed between ca. 719/720 and ca. 727), the Cibyrrhaeots were constituted as a regular theme, with its governing "strategos" first attested in 731/732. Until the 9th century, when the themes of the Aegean Sea and Samos were elevated from "droungarios"-level commands, the Cibyrrhaeot Theme was the only dedicated naval theme of the Empire. 
The theme comprised the southern coast of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), from south of Miletus (which belonged to the Thracesian Theme) to the confines of the Arab borderlands in Cilicia, including the old Roman provinces of Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia and parts of Isauria, as well as the modern Dodecanese. Its geographical position made it the "front-line" theme facing the attacks of the Muslim fleets of the Levant and Egypt, and consequently the Cibyrrhaeots played a major role in the naval aspect of the Byzantine–Arab Wars. The land, which was known for its fertility, suffered from the frequent and devastating Arab raids, which largely depopulated the countryside except for the fortified cities and naval bases. 
The seat of the "strategos" was most probably Attaleia. He drew an annual salary of 10 pounds of gold, and his overall rank in the imperial hierarchy was relatively low, but still senior to any other naval commander: twenty-fifth in the "Taktikon Uspensky" of 842/843, dropping to fifty-fifth in the "Escorial Taktikon" of 971–975. Like its other counterparts, the Cibyrrhaeot Theme was divided into "droungoi" and "tourmai", and possessed the full array of typical thematic administrative positions. Among the most important subordinates of the "strategos" were the imperial "ek prosopou" at Syllaion, the "droungarioi" of Attaleia and Kos and the "katepano" who commanded the theme's Mardaites. These were the descendants of several thousand people transplanted from the area of Lebanon and settled there by Emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695 and 705–711) in the 680s to provide crews and marines for the fleet. In the early 9th century, the thematic fleet of the Cibyrrhaeots comprised 70 ships; and in the Cretan expedition of 911, the Cibyrrhaeot theme sent 31 warships – 15 large dromons and 16 middle-sized "pamphyloi" – with 6,000 oarsmen and 760 marines. 
Around the mid-11th century, as the Muslim naval threat subsided, the Byzantine provincial fleets began a precipitate decline: the fleet of the Cibyrrhaeots is last mentioned in the repulsion of a Rus' raid in 1043, and the theme became a purely civil province, headed by a "krites" and later by a "doux". Most of its territory was lost to the Seljuk Turks after 1071, but partly recovered under Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118). The rump theme was finally abolished by Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180), and the remaining territory in Caria subordinated to the theme Mylasa and Melanoudion.

The Blizzard (magazine)

The Blizzard is a quarterly football magazine edited by Jonathan Wilson, published in both download and hard copy formats by Blizzard Media. The magazine is sold on a pay-what-you-like basis.
The Blizzard took its name from an eclectic Victorian Sunderland-based newspaper set-up by Sidney Duncan, which ran for 12 issues and was established in 1893. Wilson, who also comes from Sunderland, wanted to replicate the electic nature of this publication. The Editor's Note, which began Issue Zero, set out the magazine's ethos as an alternative to that which was currently available in football media. Jonathan Wilson wrote:
The Blizzard accommodates longer articles than a typical football magazine, with pieces up to 8000 words long. Topics are often more obscure and esoteric than other magazines, aiming to either cover little-explored components of football culture, or to take new perspectives on previously well explored issues.While the initial issue was published virtually, a limited print run was released. All subsequent issues have appeared both as pdfs, and in-print.

Trolleybuses in Bradford

The Bradford trolleybus system served the city of Bradford, Yorkshire, England for much of the 20th century. It was one of the first two trolleybus systems to be opened in the United Kingdom, along with the Leeds system.
Both systems commenced operations on 20 June 1911. However, the public service on the Bradford system did not start until four days later. The Bradford system lasted the longest of all the UK's urban trolleybus systems. Having been one of the first two such systems to open, it was also the last one to close, on 26 March 1972. Just before its closure, it also held the distinction of being the longest-lived surviving trolleybus system in the world, but with the Bradford closure that distinction passed to the Shanghai, China, trolleybus system, opened in 1914.
Many of the former Bradford trolleybuses are now preserved at various locations around the UK, including eleven of them at the Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft, Lincolnshire.

Foundation (Mercedes Lackey novel)

Foundation is a Fantasy novel written in 2008 by Mercedes Lackey. It is the first book in the The Collegium Chronicles (followed by "Intrigues" (2010), "Changes" (2011) and "Redoubt" (forthcoming). It is a depiction of the early history of Valdemar its timeline is between "The Last Herald Mage" and "Brightly Burning". The book details a change in the training of Heralds from essentially an apprenticeship like Tylendel and Vanyel were trained to a school based system like the one in "Arrows of The Queen" and "Brightly Burning". Not all Heralds are in favor of this mainly citing lack of supervision as an objection.
Plot summary.
The novel tells the story of Mags, an enslaved child working alongside other enslaved orphans in the bowels of a gemstone mine. The mine owner, Cole Peters, treats the children with casual brutality, an Mags, orphaned in his early childhood, has known no other life all the way up until the mysterious white horse stampedes into his life. This of course, is Dallen, his Companion, who assists Mags by bringing in another Herald to free him and the children. Their freedom comes on the heels of the arrest of Cole Peters, and Mags is flung into the fray of Haven as a Heraldic Trainee, with no notion of life outside of abject slavery. This, of course, left its scars, and Mags has both no idea of how to function in "normal" society, and no notion of why he so often winds up on the wrong end of trouble. His heavy accent and "stupidity" about such normal things leads to the King's Own taking him under his wing as a spy protégé, however, Mags lives in perpetual fear of the bad old days. This fear isn't unjustified, for it seems all of the Heralds are experiencing their own tumultuous changes, as they slowly abandon the old system of apprenticeships which Vanyel learned in, for one of a collegiate style such as what Herald Talia and Herald Elspeth experienced in the time of Arrows of the Queen.
This switch is due to a sudden surge in the numbers of people Chosen, and the accompanying tremendous burdening of the Heraldic, Bardic, and Healer Collegium resources. The crowding is so intense, that Mags is forced to take a room in the Companion's stable. This, on top of his painful social ineptness, sets the stage for a confrontation between Mags and his detractors. Mags, who used to sleep in worse conditions, does not mind being out in the stables, and remains unaware of why so many others do. However, one Herald accuses him of bringing all manner of illicit goods into the room because of his lodging, and nearly attacks him before the Compainions intervene. 
Because of Mags's upbringing he has few friends so he literally does not understand many things most people in the Collegium find to be the utmost of importance, however with Dallen's help he finds two true friends, Lena, a Bardic Trainee, and Bear, a Healer Trainee.
All while this is happening, Mags is trained by the Kings Own in the art of spying, and is assigned to keep an eye on two 'dignitaries' and their retinue of bodyguards and underlings who are visiting and causing trouble. He is also visiting the Guard Archives, in an attempt to find out how he ended up orphaned and enslaved in the first place. There is a suspicion that Mags' parents may have been bandits themselves, a prospect that leaves Mags troubled and desperate to find the actual Guard reports. There, he discovers that Bear has been kidnapped by the supposed dignitaries, and is being kept hostage with a mad man. The dignitaries have been digging through the guard archives, and there they attack Bear who was doing the same thing for personal reasons. Mags ends up rescuing Bear and dispatching the guards.

Dubautia plantaginea

Dubautia plantaginea is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common name plantainleaf dubautia. It is endemic to Hawaii where it is the only member of the silversword alliance that is found on all six of the largest islands (Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, Lana'i, Maui, Hawai'i). Two of the three subspecies are rare and endangered. Like other "Dubautia" this plant is called na`ena`e.
This plant varies in morphology, taking the form of a small shrub to a tree up to 7 meters tall. There are three subspecies. The dwarf subspecies, ssp. "humilis", is endemic to Maui, where there is only one population consisting of about 50 plants. This subspecies was federally listed as an endangered species in 1999. The ssp. "magnifolia" is a shrub or a tree which is endemic to Kaua'i, where there are no more than 2 populations remaining. It was listed as endangered in 2010.
These plants grow in moist and wet forest habitat with 75 to over 700 centimeters of precipitation annually.
Threats to this species and its habitat include landslides, rockslides, erosion, flooding, and invasive plant species such as Hilo grass ("Paspalum conjugatum"). The ssp. "magnifolia" was decimated by Hurricane Iniki in 1992.

Madison Middle School is a landmark school located in the northern portion of West Seattle near West Seattle High School. Washington State assessment results in reading and math identifies Madison as a "school in improvement". It was recognized in 2010 by the Center for Educational Effectiveness and Phi Delta Kappa – Washington State Chapter, for the third time as a School of Distinction for outstanding improvements in math and reading that put it in the top 5 percent of highest-improving schools in the state.
Facilities.
In 1928 construction on what was initially called West Seattle Intermediate School began. It opened in September 1929 as James Madison Intermediate School with 749 seventh and eighth grade students. Designed by School District architect Floyd Naramore for a capacity of 1300, the 1931 addition increased capacity to 1750 students. A new gymnasium designed by architects Grant, Copeland, Chervenak & Associates was added south of the original building in 1973. Seattle Public School District historic building survey in 1989 listed the school as "likely to meet landmark criteria". Seattle's Landmark Preservation Board has since designated the school as a Landmark.
In 2005 a major redesign, restoration, and expansion was undertaken by Bassetti Architects. The historic portion of the school was restored and new additions terracing down the hill to link to the playfield to the west. A new multi-use commons was centrally located between upper and lower classroom clusters. The original double-sided corridors were restructured to provide learning clusters of classrooms, labs, teacher planning offices and open flexible areas to support grade-based teams. A roof-top deck allows students to spill out from the Commons onto a structured outdoor play area. Ground-source heat pumps were installed under the playfield to provide a low-energy source for the building's heating and cooling.

"To the One" was inspired by the 1965 John Coltrane album "A Love Supreme". The liner notes were written by McLaughlin and detail how he was influenced by "A Love Supreme" both musically and spiritually.
The music came to McLaughlin over a five-week period in the summer of 2009. McLaughlin previously honoured the memory of Coltrane on his 1973 collaboration with Carlos Santana, "Love Devotion Surrender".
The album was nominated for the 2011 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album but lost to the Stanley Clarke album "The Stanley Clarke Band". The other nominees were "" by Joey DeFrancesco, "Now Is the Time" by Jeff Lorber, and "Backatown" by Trombone Shorty.
The band.
McLaughlin has been playing with this group of musicians live since 2007 but this is their first release of new material. In addition to his keyboard playing throughout the album, Gary Husband also plays drums on two tracks, "Recovery" and "To the One". He also has a piano solo on the track "Special Beings". Bassist Etienne Mbappé, who was born Cameroon and raised in Paris, replaced original 4th Dimension Bassist Hadrien Feraud when he broke his hand in 2009, has a solo on the track "Discovery". Mark Mondesir plays drums on every track except "Recovery" and "To the One". Bandleader and composer, John McLaughlin, of course, provides all of the guitar work and even plays a guitar synth on "Lost and Found" and "To the One".
Reception.
Mike Greenblatt called "To the One" "very heady, complicated, meandering, spiritual, bass-centric yet trebly and deeply satisfying" in "The Aquarian Weekly". Thom Jurek of Allmusic called the album an "inspired milestone for McLaughlin and a fine recorded introduction to one of the more exciting electric jazz groups in the 4th Dimension". Stuart Nicholson of "Jazzwise" referred to the album as "an odyssey through McLaughlin's spiritual awakening and the meaning it has had in his music". John Fordham of "The Guardian" wrote that the album is a "tight 40-minute document hums with a collaborative energy".
John Bungey of "The Times" was more mixed in his review writing "a strong group performance but a few more memorable themes amid the bustle might have added to the spiritual uplift". Randy Ray wrote on Jambands.com that McLaughlin "finds a way to pull his listeners under the surface, and into that fourth dimensional point of view".
John Kelman in All About Jazz wrote that there is "no shortage of high octane playing here" and that it is "McLaughlin's most exhilarating work and group since his Heart of Things band in the late 1990s" and closed by saying that the album is "quite simply, McLaughlin's best album in well over a decade". Ian Patterson in All About Jazz wrote that "Simply listening to his improvisations throughout the six originals leaves no doubt that he is in inspired creative form." Robert Bush, also in All About Jazz, called "To the One" the "most consistently engaging disc in years" and that "McLaughlin's chops have never been better".

Page-turner

A page-turner is a person employed to turn sheet music pages for a soloist, often a pianist, usually during a performance.
While some music is arranged so that the pages end at places where the musician can spare one hand to turn them, this is not always possible. A page-turner is often necessary for musicians who are playing complex pieces and prefer not to play from memory. A page-turner needs to be able to understand the musician's signals and follow the music to know when to turn the page, and to do so quickly and unobtrusively. Page-turners are sometimes acquaintances of the performer or members of the accompanying orchestra doing a favour. Professional page-turners are often freelance casual workers, not associated with any given concert hall or orchestra.
Mechanical page-turners are also available, sometimes controlled by the musician via a foot pedal. Charles Halle is said to have invented the automatic page-turner.

Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)

Yan Hui, also Yen Tzu or Yanzi (; courtesy name Zi Yuan (); 521 BC - 490 BC) was one of the disciples of Confucius.
Life.
Yan Hui was a native of State of Lu, the favorite of his master, whose junior he was by thirty years, and whose disciple he became when he was quite a youth. "After I got Yan Hui," Confucius remarked, "the disciples came closer to me." We are told that once, when he found himself on the Nang hill with Yan Hui, Zi-lu, and Zi-gong, Confucius asked them to tell him their different aims, and he would choose between them. Zi-lu began, and when he had done, the master said, "It marks your bravery." Zi-gong followed, on whose words the judgment was, "They show your discriminating eloquence." At last came Yan Hui, who said, "I should like to find an intelligent king and sage ruler whom I might assist. I would diffuse among the people instructions on the five great points, and lead them on by the rules of propriety and music, so that they should not care to fortify their cities by walls and moats, but would fuse their swords and spears into implements of agriculture. They should send forth their flocks without fear into the plains and forests. There should be no sunderings of families, no widows or widowers. For a thousand years there would be no calamity of war. Yu would have no opportunity to display his bravery, or Ts'ze to display his oratory." The master pronounced, "How admirable is this virtue!"
Death.
When Yan Hui was twenty-nine, his hair was all white, and at the age of 32 he died. 
After the death of Yan Hui, Confucius lamented, "Heaven has bereft me! Heaven has bereft me!". When told by other students that he was showing "excessive grief", the old philosopher replied: "Am I showing excessive grief? Well, for whom "would" I show excessive grief if not for this man?". Even years later, Confucius would say that no other student could take Yan Hui's place, so gifted and dedicated Yan Hui had been.
Veneration.
Yan Hui, along with Confucius himself, was venerated by the first emperor of the Han dynasty. The title which he now has in the sacrificial Canon, -- "Continuator of the Sage" () -- was conferred in the ninth year of the Jiajing era, A.D. 1530. Almost all the present sacrificial titles of the worthies in the temple were fixed at that time. Yan Hui's place is the first of the four Assessors, on the east of the sage.
Shrines.
Yan Hui is venerated at the Temple of Yan Hui, which is located in Qufu's walled city, a few blocks north of the Temple of Confucius.
Yan Hui's tomb is now surrounded by hundreds of tombs of his descendants, forming the Yan Family Cemetery ("Yan Forest"). A stele was installed at his tomb during the Jin (Jurchen) Dynasty, and re-erected during the Ming Dynasty. The tomb is well preserved.

Enoch Steen

Enoch Steen (1800 – 1880) was a United States military officer and western explorer. He joined the United States Army in 1832, serving at posts throughout the United States, including many remote locations in the west. During his military service, Steen explored parts of the western United States including large areas of southern New Mexico and southeastern Oregon. He served as the commander of several Union Army forts during the American Civil War. Today, there are landmarks in Oklahoma, Oregon, and New Mexico named in his honor; however, many of the place names are misspelled as "Stein".
Early life.
Steen was born on 22 February 1800 in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. His parents were Frederick Steen and Katherine Rector Steen. He was the third of five children. His family moved to Missouri when he was young. Growing up on the American frontier, Steen became a well known woodsman and hunter. As a young man, Steen worked as a surveyor before joining the volunteer Mounted Rangers as a second lieutenant on 16 July 1832.
Junior officer duty.
Steen transferred to the United States Army’s 1st United States Dragoons as a second lieutenant on 19 September 1833. He was one of the initial cadre of officers to stand-up this historic cavalry unit. In 1834, he was stationed at 1st Dragoon headquarters at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1835, he accompanied Colonel Henry Dodge on an expedition up the Platte River, following its south fork to the Rocky Mountains and then returning by way of Bent’s Fort, the Arkansas River, and the Santa Fe Trail. Later that year, Steen joined Colonel Stephen W. Kearny on an expedition along the Platte and then east to the Missouri River, meeting with Potawatomi Indians at Council Bluffs before returning to Fort Leavenworth.
Steen began the Mexican War as a captain. He departed San Antonio, Texas on 29 September 1846, leading two companies of dragoons assigned to escort General John E. Wool and his staff to the front in Mexico. During the Battle of Buena Vista on 23 February 1847, Steen led a detachment of cavalry in a charge against a large body of Mexican lancers who were attempting to capture a United States Army supply train. Steen’s attack broke and dispersed the Mexican lancer formation, saving the Army’s supplies. Steen was severely wounded during the battle, earning a brevet promotion to major for personal gallantry and meritorious conduct. Steen’s brevet promotion was effective as of 23 February 1847, the day of the battle.
New Mexico.
In the summer of 1849, Steen escorted a civilian party from Fort Leavenworth to Santa Fe in New Mexico Territory. After completing his escort duty, he established and commanded an Army outpost at Doña Ana in southern New Mexico. From there, Steen with a detachment of 50 cavalrymen tracked a band of Mimbres Apache raiders to the Santa Rita copper mines. Steen and his men engaged and defeated the Indians on 16 August 1849. However, Steen was badly wounded during the battle. This was the first military engagement between the United States Army and Apache warriors.
In June 1850, Steen led an expedition through the Organ Mountains, around the southern edge of the White Sands desert area and into Mescalero Apache country when he ran into a superior Indian force, and he withdrew to Doña Ana. Based on his reconnaissance, Steen recommended that an Army post be established near the Santa Rita mines. The Army agreed with Steen’s recommendation, and Fort Webster was established in 1852. Steen was assigned as the fort’s first commander.
However, before taking command, Steen was sent back east to lead 183 Army recruits to New Mexico for duty. Steen finally took command of Fort Webster on 7 April 1853. Shortly after taking command, he successfully negotiated peace treaties with Mangas Colorado, chief of the Mimbreno Apaches and Victorio, chief of the Chiricahua Apaches. In May 1853, Steen escorted William Carr Lane from Fort Webster to the Gila River. It was probably during this trip that "Steins Peak" and "Steins Pass" in southwestern New Mexico acquired their place names. Both were important reference points for frontier travelers. Steen was promoted to the permanent grade of major on 15 July 1853. In 1856, Steen negotiated an agreement with Cochise, chief of the Chiricahua Apaches, allowing settlers to cross Apache land while traveling to California.
In 1857, Steen helped establish Camp Moore near present day Rio Rico, Arizona. In 1858, Steen established Fort Buchanan in the newly acquired Gadsden Purchase (near present day Sonoita, Arizona), and became the post's first commander. He hoped the outpost would deter Chiricahua Apache raids in the Sonoita Valley area. Later that year, he escorted a survey party led by Lieutenant Edward Beale along a proposed road route from Fort Smith, Arkansas to the Colorado River. During the trip, "Steen’s Buttes" in Caddo County, Oklahoma was named in his honor. Steen then led six companies of cavalry into Utah as the Mormon War was coming to a close.
Oregon.
On a reconnaissance expedition from Camp Union, Steen explored the country along the Donner und Blitzen River, south of Harney Lake. After a skirmish with Paiute Indians in that area, he chased the Indians over a rugged peak that Hudson's Bay Company trapper, John Work, called "Snow Mountain". After Steen and his men cross the mountain in pursuit of the Indians, the peak became known as Steens Mountain.
In late 1860, Steen was given command of Fort Walla Walla in the Washington Territory. He remained there until the outbreak of the American Civil War.
Civil War.
In April 1861, Confederate force attacked Fort Sumter, initiating the Civil War. On 3 August 1861, Steen was assigned to the 1st Cavalry Regiment and ordered to return to the east coast. On 28 September, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, re-assigned to the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and posted to Cantonment Holt near Washington, D.C.. Steen remained there until June 1862, when he was sent to Fort Craig in the New Mexico Territory.
While Steen remained loyal to the Union, his son, Alexander Early Steen, served as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. He was killed on 7 December 1862 at the Battle of Prairie Grove in Arkansas.
In March 1863, Steen was reassigned to Benton Barracks in Missouri. On 23 September 1863, he was officially retired from the Army at Benton Barracks, for incapacity resulting from long and faithful service and wounds received in the line of duty. However, Steen continued to serve on active duty in various capacities. On 30 September 1863, he was placed in command of the Union Army’s fort at Sandy Hook in New York Harbor. In 1866, Steen was sent to the Colorado Territory to command Fort Lyon.
Later life.
When Congress passed a law prohibiting retired officers from serving on active duty, Steen left the Army. He settled on a farm in Jackson County, Missouri. Steen died at his Jackson County home on 22 January 1880. He is buried at Mount St. Mary’s Cemetery in Kansas City, Missouri.
Legacy.
Steen played an important part in the history of the western United States, leading military expeditions through large areas of the west. As a result of his early explorations, there are landmarks in Oklahoma, Oregon, and New Mexico named in his honor.
In Oklahoma’s Caddo County, a group of three of sandstone hills were named "Steen’s Buttes" by Lieutenant Edward Beale who’s survey team was escorted by cavalry under Major Steen’s command.
There is also ghost town in New Mexico named Steins. The town site is located just off Interstate 10 in Hidalgo County. It was originally called "Stein's Pass" after the nearby pass through the Peloncillo Mountains, where Steen camped in 1856 while exploring the Gadsden Purchase. The town was founded in 1880 as a fueling stop for the Southern Pacific Railroad. In the early 1900s, the town had 1,300 residents; however, the population slowly declined until the town disappeared.
In southwest New Mexico, there are two mountains and a stream named in Steen’s honor. "Steins Mountain" is located northwest of the Steins town site. The summit of Steins Mountain is above sea level. "Stein Peak" is located to the northwest of Stein’s Mountain. Its summit elevation is . Both mountains are part of the Peloncillo Range. "Steins Creek" begins on the southern slope of Steins Mountain and flows southwest across the New Mexico border into Arizona.

Skull &amp; Crossbones

Skull & Crossbones is a two-player arcade game developed by Atari Games.
Gameplay.
The game's player characters are One-Eye (player one) and Red Dog (player two), pirates on a venture to find a wizard who stole their treasure. "Skull & Crossbones" has seven game levels. In some ports of the game, the first six levels may be played in any sequence: One-Eye's Ship, Spanish Castle, Pirate's Ship #1, Ninja Camp, Pirate's Ship #2, Beach Cave, and Pirate's Ship #3. Once these levels are complete, the players go to the final level, the Wizard's Lair.
In the arcade version the players are also given three opportunities to change the difficulty of the game, at the end of One-Eye's Ship level and after the first two Pirate's Ship levels, and have a chance to get an opportunity item in the Castle, Ninja Lair, and Beach Cave. However the levels are forcibly played in the written sequence above. In two player, there are a few specific changes to how the game plays. Players must duel at the end of the level to see which gets the invulnerability item in the levels that have them (The non Pirate Ship levels)
Each Quarter adds 50 health points to whichever player the coin was added for. Each level has a timelimit that can be raised by finding hourglasses off killed enemies, but running out of time only results in slowly losing life and can be counteracted by putting in additional quarters. 
Each of the two player pirates behave the same and face either left or right but can turn with the appropriate button. The sword button can be pressed to block and the move stick can be used in addition to throw various attacks, thrusts and stabs. Red X's appeared often denoting jumps and cranks, and white crosses can be dug up with the sword button to find various treasures. A parrot belonging to the pirate constantly flies with the players and recites roughly twelve different lines nonstop.
Each of the three pirate ship levels has a Pirate Captain boss at the end of the level and a woman referred to the game as a wench who seems to provide no game benefits, while the other three levels have an Executioner(Heavy Hitter), Monk(Fast Attacker), and Medusa(Turret) boss for their respective stages. The Medusa's attacks can be avoided altogether by facing away and using back-stabs (if the players have chosen the easiest difficulty thus far, an onscreen hint advises them not to look at Medusa.) In the Wizards Lair, these bosses are encountered again in order and the player who grabbed the invulnerability item on their respective stages immediately regains the use of that item for a duration. The wizard boss at the end will appear on one side of the room and launch Wizard Balls that stun the player and when attacked will teleport to the other side and continue.

International Soundex Reunion Registry

The International Soundex Reunion Registry, Inc. is a 501(c)3 non-profit, tax exempt, humanitarian organization founded in 1975 by Emma May Vilardi. ISRR is a free mutual consent adoption reunion registry for persons desiring a reunion with next-of-kin. This agency serves the needs of family members who have been separated from each other by adoption, divorce, foster care, abandonment, or other means.
The registries filing system was based originally on Soundex Code which is a phonetic way of coding giving numeric value to consonants and ignores vowels, except as a first letter. This system allows for matching despite some differences in spelling. It was a perfect foundation for a situation where often people did not know exact spelling.
The founder, Emma May Vilardi, was a remarkable woman of extraordinary vision and courage who undertook this important, humane task of providing a safe and secure way for persons seeking contact to make themselves available to each other. This registry remains her legacy to the adoption community and the hundreds of thousands served. "It was not until Emma began looking for the reasons behind the many illnesses that she had suffered that she learned that ancestors and genetics were the key to understanding her health problems. Daring a probate judge to unseal an adoption record, she quickly learned that her ancestors had succumbed to the same diseases." 
The ISRR Executive Board of Trustees is responsible for ensuring the operation of the registry for future generations. The registry motto is, "United today for the reunions of tomorrow." For many it remains a place of hope when they feel all other resources have been exhausted, for others it was a quick and easy step that led them to connect with family members they longed to know.
Now one of many existing adoption reunion registries, Soundex is the oldest and largest of its kind. It served as a model for many state registries, for Senator Carl Levin's U.S. Senate Bill's in the 1980s trying to establish a national adoption registry, and into the 1990s and for the abundance of online registries established to help adoptees and birth family member find each other.
The adoption reform movement groups supported ISRR and recommended their members register. Most state registries, agencies and courts also refer directly to ISRR as an option for those seeking reunification with family. There are many articles and references archived in newsletters, clippings and other resources. Registration at ISRR is free because of the donations made by registrants, and the time given by volunteers. 
"Dear Abby" referred to ISRR many times over the years. Each time registrations would arrive by the thousands resulting in many matches. One story is of an adoptee who registered 20 years to the day of when his birthmother's registration arrived. Both had read the same "Dear Abby" article. The adoptee had carried it in his wallet for twenty years.
There are around 225,000 active registrations, at any given time. ISRR was paper based until 2003, when the volunteers began an imaging project that took five years to complete. Now all forms are digitized.

Inside Out (Britney Spears song)

"Inside Out" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears, included on her seventh studio album "Femme Fatale" (2011). It was written by Lukasz Gottwald, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Mathieu Jomphe, Max Martin and Bonnie McKee whilst production was handled by Dr. Luke, Max Martin and Billboard. Musically, "Inside Out" is an electropop song that uses elements of dubstep and R&B, and has been compared to Spears' previous material on previous albums "In the Zone" and "Circus", as well as the work of Madonna. Lyrically, the song has been described as a "sexy break-up song", while making references to her previous singles "...Baby One More Time" and "(You Drive Me) Crazy". The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production. Due to strong digital sales of the album, "Inside Out" peaked at number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon International Chart.
Background.
"Inside Out" was written by Jacob Kasher Hindlin and Bonnie McKee, while additional writing and song production was done by Dr. Luke, Martin, and Billboard. A small teaser of the song was unveiled by the singer on February 19, 2011. On March 11, 2011, it leaked in full online, along with another "Femme Fatale" track, "(Drop Dead) Beautiful". The song was also rumored to be the second single of "Femme Fatale"; the information was later denied following the online leak of "Till the World Ends" on March 3, 2011, which was released instead in the next day. On August 5, 2011, Spears posted a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be "Criminal", "Inside Out" or "(Drop Dead) Beautiful." After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that "Criminal" was chosen as the fourth single.
Composition.
"Inside Out" is an electropop song that features themes of dubstep and R&B, complimented with "earth-shattering synths". Lyrically, the "sexy breakup song", as described by Jocelyn Vena of MTV, opens with Spears singing, "Said you're gonna be here in a minute/ Sitting in the mirror getting pretty/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ Gotta look my best if we're gonna break up/ I can hear you knocking at the front door/ And I know exactly what you came for/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy/ Trying to say goodbye but it's hot and heavy." While the couple seems to be on the verge of a breakup, there's apparently still some sexual tension between them, which is perceived in lines such as "You ... touch me and it's breaking me down/ I'm telling you, let's just give it up and get down." Spears crescendos "So come on/Won't you give me something to remember/Baby shut your mouth and turn me inside out." during the chorus section, and then goes on to "Hit me one more time it's so amazing" and "You're the only one who's ever drove me crazy" referencing her first singles "...Baby One More Time" (1998) and "(You Drive Me) Crazy" (1999). The song was compared to her earlier work on albums "In the Zone" (2003) and "Circus" (2008) and it has been compared to that of Madonna's "Ray of Light" (1998) and "Music" (2000). The "futuristic-sounding, slow-grooving tune" was also considered reminiscent of Janet Jackson.
Reception.
The song received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted "Inside Out" is one of the "ten remaining tracks "Femme Fatale" that continue the trend the album's first two singles", considering the song's lyrics as "blatantly slutty" and praising "the much-welcomed piano breakdown". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound also agreed that "the two singles are extraordinarily infectious, as is "Inside Out", which slows the tempo, simultaneously sending Spears back to basics vocally, and into 2011 sonically." On her review of "Femme Fatale", Genevieve Koski of "The A.V. Club" commented that "songs like the dark, slinky "Inside Out", the hyper-Euro chant-along "Till The World Ends", and the strange, flute-assisted digression "Criminal" add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." "The Guardian"s Alexis Petridis commented that the song "lurches along on 's patent half-speed rhythm." While Keith Caufield of "Billboard" considered "Inside Out" "easily a natural pick for 'Femme's' third single", Hannah Rishel of "The Daily Collegian" said that "in general the song failed to hold my attention. If I heard it on the radio, I probably would change the station." Thomas Conner of the "Chicago Sun-Times" also gave the song a negative review, considering it a "weak mid-tempo fare", along with "Criminal". Following the release of "Femme Fatale", "Inside Out" reached number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, after selling 7,222 digital units of the song alone.

Dr Bruno Sälzer (born 28 June 1957) is the CEO of Escada, the international luxury fashion group. He was born into a solid farming family. He has always been interested in fashion more than fertiliser, and has been quoted in saying, "I can't explain this. There was no one in my family like this. I have checked back several generations." He is the father of four sons.
Career.
Timeline:
Sälzer started out at Hugo Boss as one of the members of the Managing Board, but steadily worked his way up to CEO position. He was the first to introduce the womenswear line at Hugo Boss. He saw the company boost its income to €154m in 2007. During his time with the company, he described his management style as old-fashioned, he favored a system where you learn how to think, how to combine things, how to set priorities. He was not a fan of MBAs. Following a dispute with the company's private equity company Permira, Sälzer left Hugo Boss and took up the CEO position in Escada, replacing Jean-Marc Loubier. The row with Permira reportedly centred around special dividends, however the departure was supposed to have been amicable. Upon leaving, he praised the work ethic and unique culture of the company. His departure from the company saw Hugo Boss’ stock fall by 9.2 percent in Frankfurt trading.
At Escada, Sälzer was employed to save the brand, which has steadily declined after the death of its co-founder Margaretha Ley. In 2008, he invested €3 million from his Hugo Boss severance pay, only to lose it, as the brand filed for bankruptcy. Megha Mittal, a member of an Indian steelmaking company, bought Escada and saved the company in 2009. Sälzer was retained as CEO, and thanked for his “relentless efforts” so far at the firm.
On 20 February 2014, according to Women's Wear Daily, Salzer will step down as CEO of Escada by December 2014.

Kaunghmudaw Pagoda

The Kaunghmudaw Pagoda ( ; Yaza Mani Sula Kaunghmudaw (); also spelled Kaung-hmu-daw) is a large pagoda on the northwestern outskirts of Sagaing in central Myanmar (Burma). Modeled after the Ruwanwelisaya pagoda of Sri Lanka, the Kaunghmudaw is known for its egg-shaped design, which stands out among more traditional-style, pyramid-shaped Burmese pagodas. The stupa's formal name "Yaza Mani Sula" signifies the enshrinement of Buddhist relics inside its relic chamber. But it is commonly known by its popular name, Kaunghmudaw (lit. "Royal Merit-Making"). It is an important pilgrimage and tourist destination in the Sagaing area.
Construction.
Construction began during the reign of King Thalun on 25 April 1636 (Friday, 8th waning of Kason 998 ME). The pagoda's relic chamber was dedicated on 23 July 1636 (Wednesday, 7th waning of 2nd Waso 998). The pagoda was completed 12 years later on 12 May 1648 (Tuesday, 6th waning of Kason 1010) towards the end of Thalun's reign.
Architecture.
The pagoda is high and has a circumference of 274 meters. The hti (umbrella or crowning) of the pagoda is high and weighs (3440 viss). The pagoda differs from the traditional Burmese-style pyramidal structures by having an arched image chamber in the center of its base. The chamber houses a massive seated -high Buddha statue, carved out of solid white marble. The head of the Buddha statue alone is about 2.4 meters in diameter. It is believed that the dome was built later around the massive statue.
The lowest terrace of the pagoda is decorated with 120 nats and devas. It is ringed by 802 stone lanterns, carved with inscriptions of Buddha's life in three languages: Burmese, Mon and Shan Yuan, representing the three main regions of Restored Toungoo Kingdom.
The pagoda dome has been continuously painted white to signify purity, in Ceylonese tradition.
According to local lore, the relic chamber of the pagoda contains the lower left tooth relic of the Buddha, 11 hair relics, an alms bowl, statues, pagodas and other relics.
Controversy.
The military government of Burma has initiated a project to paint the dome with gold paint, which has drawn criticism from locals and other Burmese.

SMS Friedrich Carl (1867)

SMS "Friedrich Carl"  was an ironclad warship built for the Prussian Navy in the mid-1860s. The ship was constructed in the French "Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers" shipyard in Toulon; her hull was laid in 1866 and launched in January 1867. The ship was commissioned into the Prussian Navy in October 1867. The ship was the third ironclad ordered by the Prussian Navy, after and , though the fourth ship to be acquired, , was ordered after but commissioned before "Friedrich Carl".
"Friedrich Carl" served with the fleet from her commissioning in 1867 until 1895, when she was removed from front-line service to serve as a training ship. During the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–1871, the ship formed part of the main German squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Jachmann. Engine trouble, however, plagued the ship and two of the other three vessels in the squadron; as a result, they made only two sorties from the port of Wilhelmshaven to challenge the French blockade. Neither resulted in combat.
"Friedrich Carl" was also deployed to Spain during an insurrection in 1873, during which she assisted in the seizure of three rebel vessels in two engagements. The ship was refitted at the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven in the 1880s. She was renamed "Neptun" in 1902 and used as a harbor ship until June 1905, when she was removed from the naval register. The following year, she was sold to ship breakers in the Netherlands and dismantled for scrap.
Design.
General characteristics.
"Friedrich Carl" was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ship was designed to displace at a normal loading, and up to with a combat load. The ship's hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal iron frames. It contained eight watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 76 percent of the length of the vessel.
"Friedrich Carl" was an excellent sea boat; the ship was responsive to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6 degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. "Friedrich Carl" carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.
A horizontal two-cylinder single expansion steam engine powered the ship. It drove a four-bladed screw in diameter. Six trunk boilers, divided into two boiler rooms with 11 fireboxes in each, supplied steam to the engine at . The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of , though on trials "Friedrich Carl" managed to make and . The ship carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . A barque rig with a surface area of 2,010 square meters supplemented the steam engine, though in service they added little to the ship's performance. Steering was controlled with a single rudder.
Armament and armor.
As built, "Friedrich Carl" was equipped with twenty-six rifled 72-pounder cannon. After her delivery to Germany, these guns were replaced with a pair of L/22 guns and fourteen 21 cm L/19 guns. The L/22 gun could depress to −5 degrees and elevate to 13 degrees, which provided a range of . The shorter barreled L/19 guns had a wider range of elevation, from −8 to 14.5 degrees, but the shorter barrel imposed a lower muzzle velocity, which correspondingly reduced the range of the gun to . The two types of gun fired the same shell, of which the total supply numbered 1,656 rounds of ammunition. The fourteen L/19 guns were placed in a central battery amidships, seven on either broadside. The L/22 guns were placed on either end of the ship. Later in her career, six revolver cannon and five torpedo tubes were added. Two of the tubes were placed in the bow, two on the ship's sides, and one in the stern on the port side. All were placed above water, and were supplied with 12 torpedoes.
"Friedrich Carl"s armor consisted of wrought iron backed with heavy teak planking. The waterline armored belt consisted of of iron backed with of teak. The central battery was protected by 114 mm of sloped iron plating on of timber. The battery's roof was protected by thick iron plating. The ship's conning tower had 114 mm thick iron armor mounted on of teak.
Service history.
The Prussian Navy ordered "Friedrich Carl" from a French shipbuilder in 1865. She was laid down at the "Societé Nouvelles des Forges et Chantiers La Seyne" shipyard in Toulon the following year. The ship was launched on 16 January 1867; fitting out work was completed rapidly, and the ship was completed before the end of the year. "Friedrich Carl" was delivered to Prussia in October 1867 and commissioned into the fleet on the 3rd of the month.
Franco-Prussian War.
At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy. "Friedrich Carl" and the broadside ironclads and , along with the small ironclad ram , had been steaming in the English Channel before the French declared war; they had left Plymouth on 10 July with the intention of steaming to Fayal in the Azores. On the 13th, however, they put into port and learned of the rising tension between France and Prussia. The ships therefore returned to Wilhelmshaven immediately, arriving on 16 July. France declared war on Prussia three days later on 19 July. "Friedrich Carl", "Kronprinz", and "König Wilhelm" were concentrated in the North Sea at the port of Wilhelmshaven. They were subsequently joined there by the turret ship , which had been stationed in Kiel.
Despite the great French naval superiority, the French had conducted insufficient pre-war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. "Friedrich Carl" and the other two broadside ironclads thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble, which left "Arminius" alone to conduct operations. "Friedrich Carl", "Kronprinz", and "König Wilhelm" stood off the island of Wangerooge for the majority of the conflict, while "Arminius" was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe river. On 11 September, the three broadside ironclads were again ready for action; they joined "Arminius" for another major operation into the North Sea. It too did not encounter French opposition, as the French Navy had by this time returned to France.
Deployment to Spain.
In early 1873, the First Spanish Republic was beset with the Cantonal Revolution. "Friedrich Carl", under the command of Vice Admiral Reinhold Werner, steamed to Spanish waters along with a pair of unarmored vessels. The ships joined a British squadron that had been patrolling the southern Spanish coast. A rebel faction of the Spanish Navy had seized four of the country's seven ironclads. Admiral Werner, the senior commander in the group, was given command of the Anglo-German force. The squadron blockaded two rebel ironclads in the port of Cartagena after they had bombarded a coastal town. While steaming off Alicante, "Friedrich Carl" encountered the rebel armed steamer "Vigilante", seized the vessel, and returned it to the national government.
"Friedrich Carl" and the British ironclad attacked two of the rebel ships—"Vitoria" and "Almansa"—without authorization from London or Berlin. The rebel vessels had attempted to extort the port of Almería. In the brief engagement, the Anglo-German force overwhelmed the rebels and seized both ships, which were subsequently turned over to the Spanish government. The rebels considered declaring war on Germany over the affair, but eventually decided against it. A captured rebel leader was briefly held on board "Friedrich Carl". Admiral Werner's blockade eventually forced the rebels to surrender, after which "Friedrich Carl" returned to Germany. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck ordered a court-martial for Admiral Werner, whose actions Bismarck considered to be excessive. Bismarck prohibited the Imperial Navy from conducting "gunboat diplomacy" in the future.
Later service.
In 1885, "Friedrich Carl" had torpedo nets installed; these remained on the ship until 1897. In 1895, the ship was disarmed; she was placed into service as a torpedo test ship on 11 August of that year. She served in this capacity until 21 January 1902, when she was renamed "Neptun" and used as a harbor ship. Her name was then freed to be reused on the new armored cruiser , which was launched on 22 June 1902. "Neptun" was formally stricken from the naval register on 22 June 1905 and sold to a Dutch ship-breaking firm in March 1906 for 284,000 gold marks. The ship was then towed to the Netherlands and broken up for scrap.

At the end of the season, Matilda celebrates her 16th birthday at the night of the eclipse while the Principal (Martha Pabon) and Sibilo (William Valdes) plan to steal the powers of Matilda and Grachi.

Also, a geek named Leo falls in love with Grachi. On the other hand, Matilda starts dating Diego, a kanay whom she has an on and off relationship due to Matilda's obsession with her powers and her witch instincts. At the end of the season, Grachi and Matilda's parents get married, thus making them stepsisters. Also, both witches teamed up to protect the wedding from an angered Leo, Mía and Athena, a witch in love with Grachi's father Francisco.

Defencist Bloc

The term 'Defencist Bloc' was used by V.I. Lenin and others to refer to the coalition of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who, after the February Revolution of 1917, dominated the soviets, and who wished to continue Russia's war effort. The term was applied to a variety of different groups, from those on the right who had been in favour of the war effort since 1914 and even supported aggressive war aims like territorial expansion, to those on the left who had adhered to the Zimmerwald anti-war movement before 1917 but approved of limited defensive war 'in defence of the revolution'. Since Defencists of these various types were often at odds with each other, the term 'Bloc' is misleading; however, the practical consequence of all varieties of Defencism under the February republic was that Russia remained in the First World War.

Draft-card burning

Draft-card burning was a symbol of protest performed by thousands of young American men as part of the opposition to the involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War. Beginning in May 1964, some activists burned their draft cards at anti-war rallies and demonstrations. By May 1965 it was happening with greater frequency. To limit this kind of protest, in August 1965, the United States Congress enacted a law to broaden draft card violations to punish anyone who "knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates" his draft card. Subsequently, 46 men were indicted for burning their draft cards at various rallies, and four major court cases were heard. One of them, "United States v. O'Brien", was argued before the Supreme Court. The act of draft card burning was defended as a symbolic form of free speech, a constitutional right guaranteed by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court decided against the draft card burners; it determined that the federal law was justified and that it was unrelated to the freedom of speech. This outcome was criticized by legal experts.
In Australia following the 1966 troop increases directed by Prime Minister Harold Holt, conscription notices were burned at mass demonstrations against Australian involvement in Vietnam. In June 1968, the government reacted by strengthening penalties for infractions of the 1964 National Service Act, including the burning of registration cards. War protest ceased in 1972 when Australia's new Labor government withdrew troops from Vietnam and abolished conscription.
From 1965 to 1973, very few men in the U.S. were convicted of burning their draft cards. Some 25,000 others went unpunished. Before 1965, the act of burning a draft card was already prohibited by U.S. statute—the registrant was required to carry the card at all times, and any destruction of it was thus against the law. Also, it was entirely possible for a young man to destroy his draft card and still answer his country's call to service by appearing at an induction center and serving in the military. And it was possible for a registrant to faithfully keep his card on his person but fail to appear when called. The draft card was not an essential part of the government's ability to draft men into the military. Thus draft-card burning was an act of war resistance more than it was draft resistance.
The image of draft card burning was a powerful one, influential in American politics and culture. It appeared in magazines, newspapers and on television, signaling a political divide between those who backed the U.S. government and its military goals and those who were against any U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Richard Nixon ran for president in 1968 on a platform based partly on putting an end to the draft, in order to undercut protesters making use of the symbolic act. As president, Nixon ended the draft in 1973, rendering unnecessary the symbolic act of draft-card burning.
Background.
United States.
From 1948, under the Selective Service Act, all American men between the ages of 18 and 26 were required to register with a local draft board. In case of war, the able-bodied ones among them could be drafted to serve in the military. The law required the men to carry their draft cards with them at all times. These were small white cards bearing the registrant's identifying information, the date and place of registration, and a unique Selective Service number.
In an amendment sponsored by Congressmen L. Mendel Rivers and William G. Bray, on August 31, 1965, the law was augmented with four words, to include penalties for any person who "knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates" the card, under 50 U.S.C. § 462(b)(3). Strom Thurmond moved the bill through the Senate, calling draft-card burning "contumacious conduct" which "represents a potential threat to the exercise of the power to raise and support armies." At the time, many observers (including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit) believed that Congress had intentionally targeted anti-war draft-card burners.
Australia.
Following the 1964 National Service Act, legislated in response to the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, 20-year-old Australian men were subject to military service based on a birthday lottery. In April 1965, Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies sent a battalion of Army regulars to Vietnam, beginning an overseas involvement in that country which lasted for seven years and provoked deeply divisive debate back home. In early 1966, Menzies retired and Harold Holt became Prime Minister. In March 1966, Holt announced troop increases bringing the total commitment to 4,500 men in Vietnam, a tripling of effort. Significantly, conscripts could now be sent into combat. Protests broke out, including a draft-card burning demonstration outside of Holt's home. In late June 1966 with President Lyndon B. Johnson listening, Holt spoke in Washington, D.C. in support of American policy. In his speech he closed by saying that Australia was a "staunch friend" of America, willing to go "all the way with LBJ". This statement was widely criticized in Australia. Marxist writer and draft-card burner Andy Blunden said in July that, "by following America into Vietnam, Holt's Australia is playing the role of Mussolini's Italy." In December the government bolstered the Vietnam presence with 1,700 more troops.
John Gorton took the Prime Minister position in January 1968. In June 1968, the government doubled the penalty for the burning of registration cards. In 1971, the government committed to a gradual but total withdrawal from Vietnam—following both Australian opinion and America's new policy. In 1972, all troops including the advisory team were ordered home from Vietnam. Draft resisters in jail were freed. The final birthday lottery was held September 22, 1972.
U.S. court cases.
Early cases.
On October 15, 1965, David J. Miller burned his draft card at a rally held near the Armed Forces Induction Center on Whitehall Street in Manhattan. He spoke briefly to the crowd from atop a sound truck and then tried but failed to burn his card with matches—the wind kept blowing them out. A lighter was offered by the crowd and it worked. Miller was arrested by the FBI three days later in Manchester, New Hampshire while setting up peace literature on a table. The 24-year-old pacifist, member of the Catholic Worker Movement, became the first man convicted under the 1965 amendment. In April 1966 with his wife and breast-feeding baby in attendance, he was sentenced to 30 months in prison. The case was argued in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in June. Miller's attorney held that "symbolic speech is protected by the First Amendment; burning a draft card is a most dramatic form of communication, and there is a constitutional right to make one's speech as effective as possible." The court did not agree. The case was decided later that year in October: Miller's conviction was confirmed and his sentence upheld. Loudon Wainwright, Jr. wrote in "Life" magazine that Miller, "without really knowing it, might be embarking on a lifelong career of protest." Miller remained free on bail until June 1968 at which time he served 22 months in federal prison.
At an anti-war rally at the Iowa Memorial Union in Iowa City, Iowa, on October 20, 1965, 20-year-old Stephen Lynn Smith, a student at the University of Iowa, spoke to the crowd and burned his draft card. He said, "I do not feel that five years of my life are too much to give to say that this law is wrong." He had previously alerted newspaper reporters and two television stations, and they were present to record his act. Smith said he was against the involvement of the U.S. in Vietnam, and that he was against the system of conscription. In November 1966 he was found guilty and placed on probation for three years.
In June–July 1967, "United States v. Edelman" was argued and decided in the U.S. Second Circuit. Thomas C. Cornell, Marc Paul Edelman and Roy Lisker had burned their draft cards at a public rally organized by the Committee for Non-Violent Action in Union Square, New York City, on November 6, 1965. A fourth man older than 36 also burned his card at the rally but was not indicted. Edelman, Cornell and Lisker were convicted and sentenced to six months.
"United States v. O'Brien".
On the morning of March 31, 1966, David Paul O'Brien and three companions burned their draft cards on the steps of the South Boston Courthouse, in front of a crowd that included several FBI agents. After the four men came under attack from some of the crowd, an FBI agent ushered O'Brien inside the courthouse and advised him of his rights. O'Brien made a confession and produced the charred remains of the certificate. He was then indicted for violating § 462(b)(3) and put on trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
O'Brien argued that the four words ("knowingly destroys, knowingly mutilates") added to the draft card law were unconstitutional, that they were an abridgment of the freedom of speech. He argued that the amendment served no valid purpose because the Selective Service Act already required draft registrants to carry their card on their persons at all times, thus any form of destruction was already a violation. He explained that he burned the draft card publicly as a form of symbolic speech to persuade others to oppose the war, "so that other people would reevaluate their positions with Selective Service, with the armed forces, and reevaluate their place in the culture of today, to hopefully consider my position." On January 24, 1968, the Supreme Court determined that the 1965 amendment was constitutional as enacted and as applied, and that it did not distinguish between public or private destruction or mutilation of the draft card. They determined that there was nothing necessarily expressive in the burning of a draft card. Chief Justice Earl Warren said, "we cannot accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea." O'Brien's previous sentence of six years was upheld.
The Supreme Court's conclusion was criticized by legal observers such as Dean Alfange Jr for its "astonishingly cavalier" treatment. Many saw in O'Brien's act a clear communicative element with the "intent to convey a particularized message", an intent to which the court did not give much weight. Instead, the court weighed as greater the government's interest "in assuring the continued availability of issued Selective Service certificates."
In 1975, legal scholar John Hart Ely found fault with "O'Brien". He pointed out that the draft-card-burning question was not decided in relation to the similar one surrounding the act of flag burning; an issue which the court had avoided for years. Ely's analysis was aided by that of Thomas Scanlon in 1972, in "A Theory of Freedom of Expression", which interpreted the freedom of speech broadly, including such public and political acts as self-immolation. In 1990 "O'Brien" was analyzed again by critics following the case "United States v. Eichman" which determined that flag burning was a form of free speech, and some made comparisons to the earlier 1984 case "Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence" which determined that sleeping at a protest rally location in a downtown park was valid as a symbolic expression intended to bring attention to the plight of the homeless. These expansive interpretations of the freedom of speech appeared large enough to include draft-card burning. The position taken in "O'Brien" was that the individual's right to freedom of speech did not limit the government in prohibiting harmful conduct. However, the harmful conduct of burning a draft card did not have the normal test applied: it was not determined to be a case of "clear and present danger".
In 1996, future Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that the "O'Brien" court did not appear to be concerned whether the law as enacted or enforced "matched, or even resembled" the asserted government interest of stopping draft resistance protests. Kagan noted that the law prohibiting the destruction of the draft card "interfered" with only one point of view: that of the anti-war protester. She allowed as how a successful challenge to "O'Brien" might come from focusing on such skewed constraints.
Rallies.
On May 12, 1964, in New York, 12 students at a rally burned their draft cards.
At the University of California, Berkeley, on May 5, 1965, amid a protest march of several hundred people carrying a black coffin to the Berkeley draft board, 40 men burned their draft cards. One of them told reporters the act was symbolic—he said "we can get new cards if we apply for them." On May 22, 1965, the Berkeley draft board was visited again, with 19 men burning their cards. President Lyndon B. Johnson was hung in effigy.
In August 1965, "Life" carried a photograph of a man demonstrating in front of the Armed Forces Induction Center on Whitehall Street in Manhattan, July 30, 1965. Like David J. Miller a few months later, he was a member of the Catholic Worker Movement. He was not arrested.
Antiwar activist Abbie Hoffman burned his draft card privately in the Spring of 1967. Hoffman's card classified him as 4F—unfit for service—because of bronchial asthma. His act was purely symbolic; he would never be drafted. However, Hoffman supported those registrants who were burning their cards.
On April 15, 1967, at Sheep Meadow, Central Park, New York City, some 60 young men including a few students from Cornell University came together to burn their draft cards in a Maxwell House coffee can. Surrounded by their friends who linked arms to protect them, the men began burning their cards. Others rushed in to join them, holding their burning cards up in the air. Watching this were police, FBI men, newsreel cameramen, reporters, photographers and passers-by. Uniformed Green Beret Army reservist Gary Rader walked to the center and burned his draft card. The 23-year-old was arrested by FBI agents several days later at his home in Evanston, Illinois. "Time" magazine estimated 75 total cards; participant Martin Jezer wrote that there were about 158 cards burnt in all. Future Youth International Party leader Hoffman was in attendance.
The reports of this large protest were discussed by the leaders of the Spring Mobilization Conference, a march of 150,000 people led by Martin Luther King Jr and Dr. Benjamin Spock starting from Sheep Meadow. The May conference developed into the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, known as The Mobe. 
In January 1968, Spock was indicted on charges of encouraging draft evasion, with the Boston 5. He was convicted on July 10, 1968. The charges were overturned on appeal in July 1969.
In May 1967 in response to the Sheep Meadow demonstration, 56-year-old anarchist intellectual Paul Goodman published a piece in "The New York Review of Books" sympathetic to both public and private draft card burning. The editors printed a salvo of responses. One from Ann D. Gordon, a doctoral student of American history, said that private, individual acts of card burning were useless in stopping the war. Jezer wrote a letter thanking Goodman for his support and, as an eye witness, corrected him on certain details. Jezer said the FBI arrested only Rader; other participants were merely visited by FBI agents. Goodman's article exhorted his readers to massive direct action in draft resistance; in response, folk singer Robert Claiborne wrote to the "Review" to say that Goodman's plan would "check the growth of the peace movement and markedly reduce prospects for ending the war." Claiborne asserted that the "great majority" of Americans were "squares" over 30 and not in favor of war protest even though they were likely interested in "ending the slaughter of their sons and other people’s sons."
October 16, 1967, was a day of widespread war protest organized by The Mobe in 30 cities across the U.S., with some 1,400 draft cards burned. At the Unitarian Arlington Street Church in Boston, draft registrants were given the opportunity to turn in their draft cards to be sent as a package to Selective Service as an act of civil disobedience against the war. Those offering their draft cards split into two groups: a group of 214 turned in their cards, and 67 chose to burn their cards. These 67 used an old candle from prominent Unitarian preacher William Ellery Channing to supply the flame. One woman, Nan Stone, burned a draft card belonging to Steve Paillet—the 1965 law allowed for anyone to be punished for draft-card burning, even someone who was not registered for the draft. Stone later typed up the information from the 214 turned-in cards to serve as a database of war resisters. She found that the average and mean age of the men was 22, and that three out of four came from Harvard, Yale, or Boston University.
At San Francisco's Federal Building on December 4, 1967, some 500 protesters witnessed 88 draft cards collected and burned.
About 1,000 draft cards were turned in on April 3, 1968, in nationwide protests organized by The Mobe. In Boston, 15,000 protesters watched 235 men turn in their draft cards. War protesters were increasingly choosing the more profound act of turning in their draft cards, an act which gave the government the name and address of the protester. Burning the draft card destroyed the evidence, and by this time was seen as less courageous.
Public reaction.
Many in America were not happy with the draft-card burners, or with the frequent depiction of them in the media. Joseph Scerra, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spoke against what he saw as too much news coverage: "All of our young people are not burning up their draft cards. All of our young people are not tearing up the flag. All of our youth are not supporting North Vietnam and carrying Viet Cong flags." In October 1967 at a rally in support of the government a news photograph was snapped of a man kissing his draft card, his girlfriend smiling at his side. In "Playboy"s November 1967 issue, Playboy Playmate Kaya Christian wrote that her "turn-offs" were "hypocrites" and "draft card burners".
Leftist "Ramparts" magazine showed four draft cards being burned on the December 1967 cover. "The Saturday Evening Post", a conservative publication, put an image of draft card burning on their cover, January 27, 1968. In 1967 off-Broadway and 1968 on Broadway and in London's West End, the musical "Hair" featured a climactic scene in Act I of a group of men in a hippie "tribe" burning their draft cards while the main character Claude struggles with the decision to join them.
President Johnson spoke strongly against the draft-card protesters, saying in October 1967 that he wanted the "antidraft movement" investigated for Communist influences. Reporting on his reaction, "The New York Times" presented the protests as being against the draft rather than the war. Many commentators focused on draft resistance as an explanation rather than the more challenging war resistance: the main concern of the protesters. In 1968 when Richard Nixon was running for election against Johnson, he determined that he could gain supporters on both sides of the war question by promising to abolish the draft, promising to make the military into a purely volunteer force. In this he was following others who had suggested such a strategy, including Donald Rumsfeld of the Republican Wednesday Group the year before. After gaining the presidency—twice—Nixon finally stopped the draft after February 1973. The last man to be drafted entered the U.S. Army on June 30, 1973.

Silver Bow Basin

The Silver Bow Basin is a valley located northeast of Juneau, Alaska, USA. It is situated on Gold Creek in an area north of Icy Gulch, and approximately north of Gastineau Peak. A trail from Juneau leads directly to the mountainside. The basin was the site of the earliest gold discovery in the Juneau area, leading to the establishment of the town called Juneau.
Etymology.
There are opposing theories as to who named the basin. One version states that it was named by Richard Harris after the mine in Silver Bow, Montana. Another theory is that it was named by a party of Montana miners in honor of their last camp in Montana.
History.
Placer was found in the basin's Gold Creek in 1880 by Harris and Joe Juneau. This gold discovery led to the creation of the town called Juneau. Over the next nine years, sluicing operations recovered thousands of ounces of gold. Sitka engineer George E. Pilz is closely connected to development in the basin, as well as having grubstaked the prospectors Harris and Juneau. By the end of the decade, large scale hydraulic mining was in operation. The mines were reached by a wagon road that zig-zagged across the hill.
Both quartz and placer mines operated in the basin, but because of climatic conditions, it was impossible to carry on milling operations in the basin itself for more than five or six mouths during the year. The largest of the mines was the Perseverance. The Fuller First Mine was the first quartz location in the basin. In 1890, Archie Campbell installed a revolving Dodge mill on the Fuller First. Over fifty placer claims on the basin's level floor were owned by the Silver-Bow Basin Mining Company, of Boston, while the Eastern Alaska Mining and Milling Company's mill was at the extreme end of the basin. In 1897, the Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company incorporated and it purchased over two dozen claims in the basin between the Perseverance and Ebner mines in order to lode mine their low grade gold ore. The Lervey Basin placer claim was opened in 1899 a mile above Silver Bow Basin. In 1915, it was reported that a tunnel was being driven through the ridge between Sheep Creek and Silver Bow Basin, to connect with a crosscut from the shaft on the thirteenth level. The purpose of the tunnel was to transport mined ore to the mills on the Gastineau Channel. Total production estimates exceed of gold.
Geography.
A glacier, which formerly extended to the mouth of Gold Creek and built up the moraines, excavated the depression that forms the basin. Subsequently, it was occupied by a lake that was separated from the lower portions of the creek by a solid rock divide. Lurvey Creek forks into North Lurvey Creek and East Lurvey Creek above the basin. The basin's lake beds are auriferous. Although the creek was filled with ice, there are patches near the basin which were not subjected to glaciation. The postglacial lake basin is filled with gravels from several creeks including Gold, Icy, Lurvey, Nugget, as well as Quartz Gulches. The basin ores are principally gold with small amounts of silver, zinc, or lead. Granite rocks are located in the northwestern part of the basin.
Silver Bow Basin is approximately long and wide, at an altitude of .

Colorado 1870-2000 (book)

Colorado 1870-2000 is a pictoral history of frontier Colorado consisting of repeat photography by photographers William Henry Jackson and John Fielder. This book is also a collaboration with the Colorado Historical Society.
Jackson - Nineteenth Century.
Jackson started photographing Colorado for the Hayden Survey to map the West in 1870. Jackson owned his own photography studio in Denver, which enabled him to make contacts with railroad companies. Jackson traveled all over the Colorado territory and later, the state of Colorado, for over 30 years. He even climbed Rocky Mountains peaks that are over 14,000 feet high in to capture his photographs for the survey. Jackson's photographs also depict various Colorado geological characteristics such as boulders and creeks. Due to the lack of railroads, Jackson did not photograph the eastern plains and northwestern Colorado. Jackson later sold his business and the negatives from his photos to a photography company in Detroit when Colorado's economy declined in the late 1890s.
Fielder - Twentieth Century.
Fielder has a long history of being a nature photographer, with his focus primarily on landscapes and nature of Colorado. Fielder had his own collection of old photographs which gave him the idea to follow in the footsteps of another historical photographer of Colorado landscapes. Fielder worked with the Colorado Historical Society which had a large collection of Jackson's photographs taken a century earlier. The historical society liked Fielder's concept to rephotograph the areas of Colorado that Jackson had traveled to and worked in collaboration with Fielder for the project. Jackson took thousands of photographs throughout his Colorado travels so it was an enormous challenge for Fielder to narrow down 300 photos that he would rephotograph from 1997-1998. Fielder used Jackson's pictures to assist him with finding the location from Jackson's pictures, which often was a challenge since some geological landmarks changed over a century. Fielder photographed the same landmarks and scenery that Jackson using the same lighting and the same view as Jackson, only a century later. Fielder states that he could not find evidence left behind by Jackson of the spots where he took his photos, although other local photographers found imprints in the ground from Jackson's equipment. "Colorado 1870-2000" is an easily recognizable hardcover brown volume of 156 Jackson-Fielder photographs. It was published in 1999 under Westcliffe Publishers, Fielder's own publishing company.
Awards.
"Colorado 1870-2000" became a success with Colorado residents and is most widely known as "Colorado Then and Now". It won the Colorado Humanitaries Colorado Book Award for non-fiction of Colorado/West in 1999. It was also named as Colorado's Tourism Website as one of the "10 Top Colorado History Reads.
Related Works.
Given the popularity of this "coffee-table style" photography book often used by Coloradans for gifts, there was demand for more of the Jackson-Fielder photographs. "Colorado 1870-2000 Revisited", published in 2001, was a companion book to the original book providing additional information and history about the images. This book was a collaboration between Fielder and Thomas Noel. The final book of the Fielder-Jackson, "Colorado 1870-2000 II" was released in 2005. It contains the remaining photos that Fielder took on his quest to rephotograph Jackson.

Order of Railroad Telegraphers

The Order of Railroad Telegraphers (ORT) was a United States labor union established in the late nineteenth century to promote the interests of telegraph operators working for the railroads.
Organizational history.
Background and early years.
While early telegraph lines often ran alongside railroad tracks in the United States, it was not until 1851 that the telegraph was first used for train routing by Charles Minot, Superintendent of the Erie Railroad. As the practice gained wider acceptance in the 1860s and 1870s, telegraphers would be stationed in individual depots along the railroad line in order to receive train orders from a centrally located dispatcher and report back on train movements; telegraphed train orders would be written out on paper and "handed up" to the crews of passing trains. 
This practice greatly increased the efficiency of single-track railroads by enabling two trains traveling in opposite directions to use the track at the same time. The dispatcher would designate one of the trains as the "superior" train and give it right of way over the "inferior" train, which would be required to pull into a siding until the superior train had passed. Local depot telegraph operators would keep track of train arrival times at each station (referred to as "OSing" the train) and pass the information on to other operators and the dispatcher. The local depot operator would also set the track switches to enable the inferior train to pull into the siding upon the approach of the superior train. 
The ability of the local depot operators to keep track of the actual time of train movements was particularly important in the era before the establishment of time zones, when local "sun time" might be different at each station; a miscalculation of the "meet time" of two trains running on a single track could result in disaster. Thus railroad telegraphers played a role in the operation of the railroads that was not unlike the role of air traffic controllers in the modern airline industry; they enabled the trains to run safely and on time.
In the 1860s, U.S. telegraphers began to form labor organizations, including the National Telegraphic Union and the Telegraphers' Protective League, in order to promote professionalism, negotiate for higher wages, and demand better working conditions. However, following an unsuccessful strike by the Brotherhood of Telegraphers, an affiliate of the Knights of Labor, in 1883, the railroad operators began to see themselves as occupationally distinct from the commercial telegraph operators, who worked in telegraph offices and primarily handled commodities reports, news reports, and personal messages.
A meeting of telegraphers representing the major U.S. railroads met in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on June 9, 1886. Organized by Ambrose D. Thurston (1852–1913), publisher of the trade journal "Railroad Telegrapher", in Vinton, Iowa, the group formed the Order of Railway Telegraphers of North America, with membership limited to telegraphers who were or who had been employed in railroad service. The Order of Railway Telegraphers was initially intended to be more of a fraternal organization than a trade union; it was ideologically closer to the conservative railroad unions than the more militant commercial telegraphers. Initially, its constitution forbade members to strike except in extreme conditions. By March 1887, the union had attracted 2250 members; the number of members grew to 9000 by March 1889.
Increased militancy in the 1890s.
In the early 1890s, members began to demand that the union take a more assertive role in negotiating wages and working conditions with the railroads. In 1891, the constitution was changed to explicitly make the ORT a "protective" organization, with the right to call strikes if negotiations with the railroads were unsuccessful; at the same time, the name was changed from "Order of "Railway" Telegraphers" to "Order of "Railroad" Telegraphers." 
One unintended consequence of this was a relatively disorganized period in which operators would stage "wildcat" strikes without consulting ORT leadership, who would then be forced into the position of sanctioning strikes that were already in progress. During the relatively prosperous years of 1890-92, the railroads were inclined to recognize the union and negotiate agreements with the ORT to guarantee wages and working hours. As a result, agreements were signed during this period with the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad, the Denver & Rio Grande, the Union Pacific, the Missouri Pacific Railroad, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. 
A.D. Thurston, who had served as Grand Chief of the ORT since its founding, was replaced by D.G. Ramsay in 1892, who promised to take a more aggressive stance in dealing with the railroads.
The Panic of 1893.
The Panic of 1893 had a severe impact on the railroad industry; major lines that had overexpanded during the prosperous years, including the Reading Railroad, the Union Pacific, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, and the Northern Pacific all went into receivership. The economic hard times led to more confrontations between the ORT and the railroads. A strike was declared against the Lehigh Valley Railroad on November 18, 1893 after the railroad refused to bargain with a joint commission composed of the ORT and the "Big Four" railroad unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen. 
The state Boards of Mediation and Arbitration of New York and New Jersey intervened and settled the dispute through mediation, a tactic that would be increasingly used by the ORT in later years. The strike was ended on December 6, 1893, and was considered to be a significant victory for the ORT when the railroad agreed to reemploy all those who had gone out on strike.
The Panic of 1893 also had a negative effect on ORT membership, dropping from 18,000 in 1893 to only 5000 in 1895. When the ORT leadership refused to sanction a sympathy strike with the workers involved in the Pullman Strike of 1894, many members left the ORT to join the American Railway Union, formed by Eugene V. Debs in June 1893. Walker V. Powell was elected Grand Chief in 1894.
Stability and growth, 1895-1900.
The ORT organized its membership into a set of system divisions in the late 1890s, which improved communications and coordination of activities. A Mutual Benefit Department was added in 1898 to provide assistance for members who were ill or unemployed. The increased use of block signaling led to the admission of switch levermen as members in 1897. The ORT took on an international focus in 1896 through its support of a strike against the Canadian Pacific Railway, called on September 28, 1896 to protest the CPR's dismissal of union employees and the railroad's refusal to negotiate with the union on wages and work rules. 
The strike ended after nine days, with the railroad recognizing the right of the ORT to represent the railroad telegraphers in collective bargaining. This victory gave the ORT a foothold in Canada, and recognition as an international union. At about the same time, the ORT began to organize railroad telegraphers in Mexico. One result of this international focus was the appearance of district reports in the "Railroad Telegrapher" in French for the French Canadian operators, and Spanish for the Mexican operators. 
Headquarters of the ORT were relocated from Vinton, Iowa, to Peoria, Illinois, in September 1895. In 1899, the ORT relocated again to St. Louis, Missouri, and became a member of the American Federation of Labor. By 1901, the ORT comprised 30 system divisions with 10,000 members, double the number of members in 1895. H. B. Perham replaced W. V. Powell as Grand Chief in 1901.
Women Operators and the ORT.
The ORT accepted women telegraphers as members from the beginning. The "Railroad Telegrapher" devoted a column to the issues and concerns of women operators, who played an active role in recruiting new members and participating in the activities of local districts. Hattie Todd Pickard joined the ORT when she began operating for the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway in 1890; after she and her husband moved to Rawlins, Wyoming, in 1892, she began working for the Union Pacific and was elected Assistant Chief of Overland Division No. 196 of the ORT. Katherine B. Davidson, a telegrapher in Cambridge, Ohio, was elected District Representative of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway System, ORT District 33, in 1905. Ola Delight Smith joined the ORT in Gainesville, Georgia, in 1906, and began a long career as a labor organizer and journalist.
Impact of Hours of Service Act of 1907.
Long working hours were a major issue among railroad telegraphers. Railroad operators were the "air traffic controllers" of the railroads; long hours and the resulting fatigue could result in errors in judgment and serious accidents. In 1907, a bill was introduced in Congress to limit the maximum number of hours that railroad employees had to work in a twenty-four hour period, known as the La Follette Hours of Service Act, after its chief sponsor, Senator Robert La Follette Sr. of Wisconsin. While this bill did not specifically address railroad telegraphers, a similar bill had been introduced and passed in the House of Representatives to limit the working hours of railroad telegraphers to no more than nine hours in a 24-hour period. 
This bill was offered as an amendment to the La Follette bill in the Senate; however, members of the committee to which it was referred bowed to pressure from the railroads and attempted to increase the maximum number of working hours allowed in a single day to twelve hours, a move which enraged ORT members. They immediately began using the telegraph to bombard their congressional representatives with messages of protest, which resulted in the original nine-hour limit being reinstated. The La Follette Hours of Service Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt on March 4, 1907.
Although the passage of the Hours of Service Act improved conditions for railroad operators, operators at small stations might still be required to remain "on duty" for as much as twelve hours in a day, or have their total working hours spread over a longer interval, known as a "split trick." The ORT supported an amendment to reduce the workday still further to eight hours and eliminate the split trick. However, the ORT did not coordinate its efforts with the other railroad unions, and when the Adamson Act, passed in 1917, mandated an eight-hour working day for most railroad employees, it did not explicitly include telegraphers.
Nationalization of the railroads, 1917-1920.
With the entry of the U.S. into the first World War, the railroad and telegraph industries were placed under government control. On December 26, 1917, the United States Railroad Administration (USRA) took control of the railroads. The USRA was generally supportive of the interests of the union members; during the period of nationalization, railroad operators were limited to an eight-hour workday and the ORT was granted collective bargaining capability on a national level. The ORT was able to sign agreements with the Santa Fe, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, the Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. By 1917, ORT membership had grown to 46,000.
A Board of Railroad Wages and Working Conditions was set up by the Railroad Administration. ORT Grand Chief Perham appeared before the Board to request a 40 percent increase in pay, an eight-hour day, and relief from handling government mail by railroad telegraphers. While the Board did provide minimal wage increases, they were far less than the requested 40 percent, and the resulting discontent among ORT members resulted in Perham's defeat in a 1919 election and his replacement as Grand Chief by E. J. Manion. Federal control of the railroads ended on March 1, 1920. When the contracts that had been negotiated while under federal control expired the following year, the ORT had to re-negotiate agreements with the individual railroads.
The ORT in the 1920s.
The early 1920s were the peak years for ORT membership; by 1922, the union boasted 78,000 members in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Some railroads, including the Santa Fe, the Louisville and Nashville, and the Great Northern, maintained essentially the same agreements with the ORT that they had established during the years of government control. A dispute with the Atlantic Coast Line led to a strike in 1925 that ended with the railroad making concessions to the union and signing a new agreement.
The Great Depression.
Membership in the ORT began to decline after the stock market crash of 1929, due not only to economic conditions but also to the increasing use of centralized traffic control, which no longer required the presence of a telegrapher in each station. The membership fell to 63,000 in 1929, and continued to fall throughout the Depression years of the 1930s. As a result of the declining membership and the loss of revenue from dues, the ORT was forced to suspend payment of pensions to retired members through the mutual benefit program.
The ORT versus Railway Express, 1944.
By the beginning of World War II, ORT membership had fallen to around 40,000 as the railroads became involved in the war effort. Railroad telegraphers often had multiple employment as station agents, express agents, and Western Union telegraphers, with each employer paying a portion of the operators' salary. In 1930, the Railway Express Agency, which employed some ORT members as express agents, began handling shipments of perishable items, which had previously been handled as freight shipments on the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. The ORT members who served as express agents as well as telegraphers for the railroad were offered individual pay adjustments on short notice, which the ORT claimed was a violation of the Railway Labor Act of 1926, which required 30 days' notice of any pay adjustment. Additionally, the ORT charged that the individual pay adjustments were in violation of a collective bargaining agreement that had been signed with Railway Express in 1917. 
When the company refused to participate in a Board of Adjustment, a suit was brought by the ORT in U.S. District Court. The court's decision in favor of the ORT was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the suit was finally brought to the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided in favor of the union in 1944. The Supreme Court decision established the primacy of agreements reached by collective bargaining over individual agreements, and upheld the union's right to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of its members.
Name Changes and Final Years.
The decline of the railroad industry in the 1950s and 1960s led to layoffs and discharges of ORT members. When the ORT attempted to protect its members' jobs by demanding the right to veto job cutbacks, it was accused of "featherbedding," requiring the employment of unnecessary workers, by railroad executives. The ORT called a strike in 1962 to protest layoffs of 600 telegraphers on the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad. A mediation board created by President John F. Kennedy found in favor of the railroad in October 1962, calling the layoffs justified and denying the union the right to veto layoffs. However, the railroad was required to give 90 days' notice to terminated employees, and to pay laid-off telegraphers 60 percent of their annual salary for as much as five years.
In 1965, the ORT changed its name to the Transportation Communications Employees Union; that union was merged into the Brotherhood of Railway & Airline Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express & Station Employes (BRAC) in 1969. At the time of the merger, the ORT had about 30,000 members. In 1985, BRAC chose to revive the TCU identity, and in July 2005, the "new" TCU affiliated with the International Association of Machinists, with full merger to occur no later than January 2012.

Twenty Twelve

Twenty Twelve was a BBC television comedy series written and directed by John Morton. Starring Hugh Bonneville, Jessica Hynes and Amelia Bullmore, the programme was a spoof on-location documentary (or mockumentary) following the organisation of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. It was first broadcast on UK television station BBC Four in March 2011 to coincide with the 500 day countdown to the opening ceremony.
"Twenty Twelve" gained mainly positive reviews from critics, and a four-part second series was announced on 15 April 2011, which began airing on 30 March 2012 on BBC Two. A further three episodes of series 2 began airing from 10 July 2012. The series' last episode was broadcast on 24 July 2012, three days before the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.
Plot.
The series follows the trials of the management of the fictional Olympic Deliverance Commission (ODC), the body tasked to organise the 2012 London Summer Olympics. Over the series, the ODC have to overcome logistical difficulties, production errors, infrastructure problems and troublesome contributors. The main character is Ian Fletcher, the Head of Deliverance, who is in overall charge of the ODC, and is generally efficient but often has to clean up a PR disaster after the other managers make a mistake. A running thread in series one are the hints that his marriage to a high-flying lawyer is breaking down, which comes to a head in episode six. It is evident that his PA Sally is in love with him, although this remains unspoken.
Meanwhile, Siobhan Sharpe is the excitable, but ultimately clueless Head of Brand through her PR company Perfect Curve. She answers almost every problem with phrases that have almost no substance whatsoever, and never turns her phone off during meetings with the other managers. Consequently, the rest of the managers find her ideas and enthusiastic attitude tiresome, particularly Nick Jowett, Head of Contracts, a blunt Yorkshireman who generally opposes ideas without making alternative suggestions, whilst emphasising that he is from Yorkshire.
Kay Hope, Head of Sustainability, is in charge of sorting out what will happen to the buildings, stadia and other Olympic venues after the games. Hope is emphatic that Legacy is something separate from Sustainability although no one makes any attempt to differentiate these two apparently identical areas. In series two a new 'Head of Legacy' is appointed, whom Hope clashes with on virtually all subjects. She continually mentions that she is a single mother after a bitter divorce, and is paranoid about her public image. Finally, Head of Infrastructure Graham Hitchens gives the impression that he knows everything about the London transport and traffic systems, but evidently does not.
Reviews.
Critical reviews.
Reviews for episode 1 were mixed, commenting that it was milder in its satire than they expected; Ed Cumming in "The Telegraph" stated "Perhaps it just needs some time to settle. Though it was very funny in parts, the first episode of "Twenty Twelve" suggests that the series, like the actual cost of the Olympics, might hit slightly wide of its ample target." Likewise, Sam Wollaston in "The Guardian" suggested that due to the participation of Seb Coe it was "on song": "Biting satire this isn't. It's nibbling satire, delivered by Garra Rufa fish..."The Thick of It" is a lot more entertaining...I don't think that politicians were removing their shoes, rolling up their trousers and queuing up for cameos in "The Thick of It"". Brian Viner, writing in "The Independent" was more impressed by Coe's cameo; "There is surely no other country in the world that would laugh at itself in this way, even persuading the vast project's principal mover-and-shaker, in our case the Rt Hon Lord Coe KBE, to participate in the joke". He went on to commend the series "...I was hooked anyway, by the mischief in John Morton's script and the beautifully nuanced performances of, in particular, Hugh Bonneville and Jessica Hynes".
Brian Viner, reviewing the series as a whole stated the series was "always amusing and sporadically very funny... It's hard to think of a spoof documentary that has been more fortuitously timed than "Twenty Twelve"."
Real-life similarities.
It was widely commented upon in the press that the day after the broadcast of the first episode, which features problems with the 1,000 days countdown clock, the real-life clock in Trafalgar Square broke soon after it had been launched by Lord Coe and London mayor Boris Johnson.
An additional coincidence occurred when some of the first athletes to arrive in London for the Olympics suffered delays; their bus drivers were unfamiliar with London and unable to find the Olympic Park in scenes that closely resembled the plot of episode 2.
A further similarity was also noted in the plot of the final episode, which involved the idea of "The Big Bong", put forward by a conceptual artist, that everyone around the UK could play as many instruments as they like to signal the start of the Opening Ceremony; which is almost exactly what was asked of the nation – "to ring thousands of bells at the same time, whether schools bells, church bells, town hall bells, bicycle bells or door bells" at 8.12 AM on the first day of the Olympic Games. The idea, "All the Bells" is the work of Turner Prize-winning artist and musician Martin Creed.
"The Games" plagiarism accusation.
"Twenty Twelve" has been criticised as bearing a strong resemblance to the Australian mockumentary series "The Games", a similar series set before the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Writer of "The Games" John Clarke said, "We worked very hard on that project and we had long conversations with these people who've now done a show like that in Britain".
The BBC denied claims of plagiarism. "It is a very different show, the only similarities between them are that they are both set around the Olympics," a corporation source said. Clarke's own website later made a reference to the dispute by describing himself and writing partner as "run a charitable institute supplying formats to British television".
Awards.
The programme was the winner of the Best Sitcom category at the British Comedy Awards 2011, while Jessica Hynes received the Best Comedy Performance award for her role from the Royal Television Society. For his role in "Twenty Twelve" Osy Ikhile was nominated for "Best TV Comedy Performance" at the Black International Film Festival and Music Video & Screen Awards.
In May 2013, the programme was awarded title of 'Best Sitcom' at the annual BAFTA awards, with star Olivia Colman also picking up the award for 'Best Female Comedy Performance', a category in which co-star Jessica Hynes was also nominated. Hugh Bonneville also received a nomination for his role of Head of Deliverance, Ian Fletcher.
DVD release.
On 23 October 2012 BBC Home Entertainment released the entire series in a two-disc DVD set.
Sequel.
After the final episode had aired, there was speculation in the media about a third series with the team liaising with the organisation team of the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, or becoming management consultants. When asked about whether the hit show could return, main star Bonneville said, "Absolutely. They could go and help with the organisation of the Rio Games in 2016...but ultimately, this is a crack team that could go anywhere and manage anything – the City, say, or the armed services. The NHS also needs rebranding. They could get Ian in to announce, 'If health is about anything, it's about managing expectations. We have got to get people to appreciate there are a lot of positive things about ill health. We need to make it sexy'."
A sequel was announced by the BBC in late 2013 for broadcast in 2014. Named "W1A", it follows Ian Fletcher (Bonneville) and Siobhan Sharpe (Jessica Hynes) as they pursue new careers as part of the BBC management team.

<doc id="31159466" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31159466" title="The Jo Stafford Show (1954 TV series)">
The Jo Stafford Show (1954 TV series)

The Jo Stafford Show is a 15-minute musical variety program which aired on CBS in prime time in the 1954–1955 television season. Jo Stafford began her solo singing career after success with the big band group known as The Pied Pipers. Arrangements for the program were handled by Stafford's husband, Paul Weston, himself a conductor and arranger at Capitol Records and Columbia Records. The series aired on Tuesday evenings at 7:45 Eastern Time after "Douglas Edwards with the News" and preceding the half-hour "The Red Skelton Show". Singer Perry Como had a similar 15-minute program on CBS in the same time slot on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. Paul Weston wrote a special theme song for the show.
The show had the same cast of regular performers Stafford worked with during her "Chesterfield Supper Club" shows from Hollywood. Paul Weston and his Orchestra and the Starlighters provided the music and vocal accompaniments on the television show just as they had done on Stafford's hosted "Supper Club" radio programs.
The television program was done live. During the year it aired, Stafford was beset with many of the on-air difficulties which came with live television, including the loss of her skirt on one show while singing "Let Me Go, Lover!". One of the cast members tripped, and as he fell, a button on his coat caught in Stafford's costume. Her skirt falling along with the actor, Stafford tried holding onto it while singing "Let me go".
The decision to end Stafford's television program was not hers, but that of CBS. At the time of the cancellation, the show's sponsor, Gold Seal Company, contemplated moving the Stafford program to NBC. The loss of the television show was another factor in Stafford's move from Columbia Records, owned by CBS, back to Capitol Records, where she had her first solo recording contract. Stafford received an Emmy nomination in 1955 as Best Female Singer for her work on the program.
Stafford was born in Coalinga, California. Though she had been trained as a teenager in opera, she instead joined her two sisters, Christine and Pauline, to form the Stafford Sisters vocal group. One reason for her shift away from opera was the decline in popularity of that genre during the Great Depression. Her career spanned five decades from the late 1920s to the early 1960s. From 1949 until 1953, Stafford made at least four hundred broadcasts for Radio Luxembourg and the Voice of America. In 1961, Stafford also had a short-lived series of musical specials on British television, with American and British guests.
"The Jo Stafford Show" aired during a period when 15-minute prime time programs were relatively common. Such offerings began as early as the 1948–1949 television season, but they had largely disappeared by the time of the 1957–1958 season.

2011 Jeff Byrd 500

The 2011 Jeff Byrd 500 presented by Food City was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race that was held on March 20, 2011 at Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee. Contested over 500 laps, it was the fourth race of the 2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. The race was won by Kyle Busch, for the Joe Gibbs Racing team. Carl Edwards finished second, and Jimmie Johnson clinched third. 
There were ten cautions and 17 lead changes among eight different drivers throughout the course of the race. It was Busch's first win of the 2011 season, and the 20th of his career.
Report.
Background.
As a tribute to the late president of the Speedway who died in 2010, longtime race title sponsor K-VA-T Food City, which celebrated the 20th year of race sponsorship in 2011 (as of 2013, the longest continuous sponsorship deal in NASCAR for a race), named the race in his memory, henceforth the Jeff Byrd 500 presented by Food City.
The track, Bristol Motor Speedway, is one of five short tracks to hold NASCAR races, the others being Richmond International Raceway, Dover International Speedway, Martinsville Speedway, and Phoenix International Raceway. The standard track at Bristol Motor Speedway is a four-turn short track oval that is long. The track's turns are banked from twenty-four to thirty degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked from six to ten degrees. The back stretch also has banking from six to ten degrees.
Before the race, Tony Stewart was leading the Drivers' Championship with 113 points, tied with Kyle Busch in second . Carl Edwards and Juan Pablo Montoya followed in third and fourth with 106 points, three ahead of Ryan Newman and ten ahead of Paul Menard in fifth and sixth. Martin Truex, Jr. in seventh had 95, the same number of points as Denny Hamlin in eighth. They were one point ahead of A. J. Allmendinger in ninth, while Dale Earnhardt, Jr. was tenth with 91. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Ford was leading with 21 points, three ahead of Toyota in second. Chevrolet was placed in third with 16 points, while Dodge followed with 11. Jimmie Johnson was the race's defending winner from 2010.
Practice and qualifying.
Three practice sessions were held before the race; the first on Friday, which lasted 90 minutes. The second and third were both on Saturday afternoon, and lasted 45 minutes each. Edwards was quickest with a time of 14.912 seconds in the first session, 0.076 seconds faster than Johnson. Greg Biffle was just off Johnson's pace, followed by Kasey Kahne, Menard, and David Ragan. Kyle Busch was seventh, still within a second of Edwards' time.
Forty-four cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three could qualify for the race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Edwards clinched the 9th pole position of his career, with a time of 14.989 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Biffle. Regan Smith qualified third, Menard took fourth, and Ragan started fifth. Johnson, Jeff Gordon, Truex, Mark Martin and Kahne rounded out the top ten. The driver that failed to qualify for the race was Ken Schrader. Once the qualifying session concluded, Edwards stated, "I'm enjoying this. I'm having fun. I'm hoping it lasts, and I'm going to keep driving the way I'm driving until we win a championship, or this car won't go as fast."
In the second practice session, Stewart was fastest with a time of 15.364 seconds, more than six hundredths of a second quicker than second-placed Reutimann. Martin took third place, ahead of Jamie McMurray, Kurt Busch and Jeff Burton. In the third and final practice, Martin was quickest with a time of 15.472 seconds. Brian Vickers followed in second, ahead of Hamlin and Joey Logano. Stewart, who was first in the second practice, was fifth quickest, with a time of 15.570 seconds. Montoya, Gordon, Truex, Menard, and Kurt Busch rounded out the first ten positions.
Race.
The race, the fourth of the season, began at 1:00 p.m. EDT and was televised live in the United States on Fox. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race, the air temperature at ; mostly cloudy skies were expected. Mike Rife, reverend of the Vansant Church of Christ, began pre-race ceremonies with the invocation. Billy Ray Cyrus performed the national anthem, and Claudia Byrd, Christian Byrd and Belton Caldwell, gave the command for drivers to start their engines.

<doc id="31159534" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31159534" title="Disabled Veterans National Foundation">
Disabled Veterans National Foundation

The Disabled Veterans National Foundation is a registered charity that provides service for disabled veterans. Founded in 2007, the organization is based in Washington D.C. and is funded by donations. 
History.
DVNF was founded in the fall of 2007 by six women veterans and State Women Veterans Coordinators to expand their scope of work within the veterans' community.
Mission.
The Disabled Veterans National Foundation serves the needs of veterans, including homeless veterans, women veterans, and veterans who experience Posttraumatic stress disorder, brain injuries and invisible disabilities. According to their website, their mission is to "exists to change the lives of men and women who came home wounded or sick after defending our safety and our freedom."
Disbursement of funds.
The Disabled Veterans National Foundation has provided $1 million in aid for nearly 23,000 veterans in six states. The foundation sent goods to centers in California, Houston, Knoxville, and Kansas City which spans from spring water, men's shirts, bananas, paper towels and work gloves. The organization has worked to lobby congress to pass a bill helping homeless veterans gain access to housing and homeless assistance programs.
CharityWatch warns that less than one percent of monies collected go to veterans groups. subsequently the organization has received an F rating for is transparency and performance.
A CNN investigation that aired on Anderson Cooper 360° alleged that after reviewing DVNF's annual tax returns the organization spends more than one dollar on fund raising expenses for each dollar raised. 
According to the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, in March 2010, the board of directors commissioned Professor Richard Harold Steinberg to do an analysis to determine whether their approach was working, after an initial investigation by CNN. Steinberg found that there was no cause of concern regarding misrepresentation to potential donors.
Board members.
In April 2010, Precilla Wilkewitz, a Vietnam War veteran who served from 1966 to 1969, was named President of the veterans group. She replaced DVNF co-founder Delilah Washburn who died in April 2010. Wilkewitz is also the State Quarter Master Adjutant for the Louisiana Veterans of Foreign Wars. In 2005, Wilkewitz was reappointed by Louisiana Governor Kathleen B. Blanco to serve on the Louisiana Veterans Affairs Commission for a six-year term, ending in 2011. Under the direction of Governor Bobby Jindal, she helped them orchestrate the first Annual Women Veterans Forum to educate women veterans about VA entitlements.
In December 2012, DVNF announced the addition of Steve Weyher and Mike McNaughton to its board of directors. Steve Weyher is a Vietnam veteran of the U.S. Army who served until 1971. Mike McNaughton, also a veteran of the U.S. Army, and served in the military until 2004.
Criticism.
The Disabled Veterans National Foundation has not responded to written Better Business requests for accountability information beyond that typically included in financial statements and government filings, in order to demonstrate transparency and strengthen public trust in the charitable sector. According to the charity watchdog group, the American Institute of Philanthropy, the Disabled Veterans National Foundation is, "contractually obligated to allow another fundraising company it hired, Brickmill Marketing Services to keep 100% of what it raises from donors until the charity's debts to this company Marketing Services are paid off." The Institute found that the Disabled Veterans National Foundation has obscene fundraising costs, needing up to 98 cents to raise every dollar. On May 7, 2012, CNN's Anderson Cooper did a lengthy segment about the Disabled Veterans National Foundation, exposing that very few fundraising dollars are spent on veterans or true assistance. The investigative report further highlighted that the few material products or goods given to veterans groups were items such as football pants, chef jackets and thousands of Coconut M&Ms.
In May 2012, Senator Max Baucus, chair of the Senate Finance Committee and Senator Richard Burr of the Veterans' Affairs Committee stated they are investigating DVNF following the CNN report. The open letter to DVNF contained 14 questions about their tax-exempt status and fundraising activities.

1933 in Canadian football

Canadian Football News in 1933.
The Toronto Argonauts lost their first two games of the season, only to storm back and win eight straight, including their first Grey Cup win in 12 years.
The Winnipeg St.John's were a no show at the annual meeting of the Manitoba Rugby Football Union. It was later learned that the St.John's had suspended operations for one season while they got their finances in order.
The MRFU made attempts to get another organization to take over the operations of the St.John's for the 1933 season. Although there was interest in taking over the team on a permanent basis, there was no interest in being custodian of the team for just one season.
In August, the players of the St.John's were dispersed between the Winnipegs and the Garrison. The Garrison was an Army team and only servicemen were eligible to play on the team. The Garrison claimed the only player who qualified (Alf Woods) and the remainder of the players ended up in the camp of the Winnipegs.
With an abundance of players available the Winnipegs operated two teams in 1933. The best players ended up on the Winnipegs who were wearing brand new blue jerseys (they weren't blue & gold until 1934). The remaining players wore the old green jerseys and they played under the name Shamrocks.
The Winnipeg St.John's failed to re-form in 1934.

Minor loop feedback

Minor loop feedback is a classical method used to design stable robust linear feedback control systems using feedback loops around sub-systems within the overall feedback loop. The method is sometimes called "minor loop synthesis" in college text books, some government documents and course descriptions of electrical engineering classes.
The method is suitable for design by graphical methods and was used before digital computers became available. In World War 2 this method was used to design Gun laying control systems. It is still used now, but not always referred to by name. It is often discussed within the context of Bode plot methods.
Notability.
"minor loop feedback" returns 12,200 hits from Google. Among them are
Example.
Telescope position servo.
This example is slightly simplified (no gears between the motor and the load) from the control system for the Harlan J. Smith Telescope at the McDonald Observatory. In the figure there are three feedback loops: current control loop, velocity control loop and position control loop. The last is the main loop. The other two are minor loops. The forward path, considering only the forward path without the minor loop feedback, has three unavoidable phase shifting stages. The motor inductance and winding resistance form a low-pass filter with a bandwidth around 200 Hz. Acceleration to velocity is an integrator and velocity to position is an integrator. This would have a total phase shift of 180 to 270 degrees. Simply connecting position feedback would almost always result in unstable behaviour.
Current control loop.
The innermost loop regulates the current in the torque motor. This type of motor creates torque that is nearly proportional rotor current, even if it is forced to turn backward. Because of the action of the commutator, there are instances when two rotor windings are simultaneously energized. If the motor was driven by a voltage controlled voltage source, the current would roughly double, as would the torque. By sensing the current with a small sensing resister (RS) and feeding that voltage back to the inverting input of the drive amplifier, the amplifier becomes a voltage controlled current source. With constant current, when two windings are energized, they share the current and the variation of torque is on the order of 10%.
Velocity control loop.
The next innermost loop regulates motor speed. The voltage signal from the Tachometer (a small permanent magnet DC generator) is proportional to the angular velocity of the motor. This signal is fed back to the inverting input of the velocity control amplifier (KV). The velocity control system makes the system 'stiffer' when presented with torque variations such as wind, movement about the second axis and torque ripple from the motor.
Position control loop.
The outermost loop, the main loop, regulates load position. In this example, position feedback of the actual load position is presented by a Rotary encoder that produces a binary output code. The actual position is compared to the desired position by a digital subtracter that drives a DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) that drives the position control amplifier (KP). Position control allows the servo to compensate for sag and for slight position ripple caused by gears (not shown) between the motor and the telescope
Synthesis.
The usual design procedure is to design the innermost subsystem (the current control loop in the telescope example) using local feedback to linearize and flatten the gain. Stability is generally assured by Bode plot methods. Usually, the bandwidth is made as wide as possible. Then the next loop (the velocity loop in the telescope example) is designed. The bandwidth of this sub-system is set to be a factor of 3 to 5 less than the bandwidth of the enclosed system. This process continues with each loop having less bandwidth than the bandwidth of the enclosed system. As long as the bandwidth of each loop is less than the bandwidth of the enclosed sub-system by a factor of 3 to 5, the phase shift of the enclosed system can be neglected, i.e. the sub-system can be treated as simple flat gain. Since the bandwidth of each sub-system is less than the bandwidth of the system it encloses, it is desirable to make the bandwidth of each sub-system as large as possible so that there is enough bandwidth in the outermost loop. The system is often expressed as a Signal-flow graph and its overall transfer function can be computed from Mason's Gain Formula.

Krishnarao Palem

Krishnarao Palem is a village in Chatrai mandal, Krishna district, Andhra Pradesh, India.
This is well known for the growth of mangoes besides which paddy is also cultivated. The water source for the irrigation is from Pedda cheruvu, voora cheruvu, venkata reddy cheruvu, etc. Hanuman temple in the village is constructed with Sita Rama Laxmana idols on the facade of the temple. The people from this village have welcoming attitude towards known or unknown guests. They consider a guest is Him arriving at their doors. "Even the poorest people in India will do their utmost care to make sure their guests are well looked after.
The village shares khammam and Krishna districts. This village gives a humble look and its great attitude to revere the visiting guests. However, the village gives pitiable look with its low income GDP. For social scientists, property was and in some gauge remains not only the decisive but the sole source of power.
Galbraith infers that as long as it remains in private hands no others can possess power. There remains the question of ‘how extensively the state should intervene to get a wider distribution of property (and associated income) and thus of the power emanating there from’. The basic problem in the village is lack of educated people. " Behnassi.M "et al." (eds) pointed out a combination of factors that cause food crisis. Some of the key components lead to crises:" 
1. lack of “food entitlement” 2. poor governance, 3. Struggle between increases in population and food; 4. total growing consumer demand combined with proximity to further yield growth of key crops; 5. Under-investment in agricultural research; 6. More on “Gene Revolution”; 7. Conflict and poverty; 8. Diversion of food crops for feed and fuel; 9. Global environmental change: 
"Most relevant causes that lead crises :(Behnassi.M "et al."; 2011)" 
1. energy shortage and prices, biofuels, global warming, fresh water shortage, economic chaos, higher population levels, inefficient agricultural policies, soil degradation and grabbing, loss of crop varieties and genetic contamination, farmer shortages, fish declines, general ignorance of food and inadequate governance.
Of fruits pride of place is taken by Mango which is grown in orchards and is much valued in the world. The basic livestock of the peasant is cattle, used for farm land tilling and transport. Ms. Priya Basu, a leading Senior economist in world bank expresses in her book that "as efforts are made to improve the formal financial sector's ability to serve the poor, microfinance can play an important role in the interim". "The term 'microfinance' typically covers the poor in rural, semi-urban, and urban areas, the focus here is on the rural poor."
Farmers don’t see the cultivation as a profitable profession. Villagers do have meager medical facilities in the area. Agriculture based processing industries are yet to be encouraged. Policies and political administration should get more involved for the betterment of the livelihood of villagers with better infrastructure and encourage the children from villages especially girls to go for higher education. People should emulate others who send their children for higher education.
A farmer in forties expressed concern about education:
"At the age of six, I had to walk 5 km to and from the nearest primary school, going in scabby clothes. When I was ten I had to drop from my schooling because I caught some fever. As I am aware about the education and its value, I sent my eldest daughter to complete electronics & communication engineering who is now in USA and my son pursuing the same engineering degree".

A. Ray Smith

A. Ray Smith (May 1, 1915 - June 28, 1999 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA) was a long-time baseball executive, best known for his ownership of the minor-league Tulsa Oilers franchise, which he later moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where the team set minor league attendance records.
Biography.
Born in Dugger, Indiana, he played football at, and received a business administration degree from, Indiana University. With Clint Murchison, he co-founded Tecon Industries, a construction company predecessor of Standard Industries. He supervised the company's role in major construction projects around the world, including the St. Lawrence Seaway and the widening of the Panama Canal. During World War II, he was a colonel in the 8th Air Force Corps of Engineers. He moved to Tulsa in 1958, and bought out Murchison's interest in Standard Industries in 1961. In February of that same year, he and a partner, Grayle Howlett bought the Tulsa Oilers; Smith's initial investment was $25,000. A few months later, in July 1961, he bought out Howlett's interest and became sole owner. 
The Oilers moved from the AA Texas League to the AAA Pacific Coast League in 1966. He contributed to the revival of the American Association in 1969 and moved the Oilers to that league. From 1963 to 1966, he also owned one-tenth of the Cleveland Indians, a Major League Baseball team.
During Smith's ownership, the Oilers won several league titles but struggled with the deteriorating condition of their aging stadium, Oiler Park. Unable to secure public support in Tulsa to replace or rebuild the ballpark, Smith ultimately moved the Oilers to New Orleans, Louisiana in 1977, renaming the team the New Orleans Pelicans, and then to Springfield, Illinois in 1978 as the Springfield Redbirds. 
After the 1981 season, he again moved the team, to Louisville, Kentucky, where they became the Louisville Redbirds (later the Louisville RiverBats and now the Louisville Bats). The team was a great success in Louisville, setting minor league attendance records. Smith was named Executive of the Year by "The Sporting News" in 1983. 
In 1985, he bid on the Cincinnati Reds, however he was outbid by Marge Schott. 
After the 1986 season, Smith sold the Redbirds. He then attempted to bring baseball to St. Petersburg, Florida, but was unable to bring that goal to fruition. 
He also served on the board of the Anaheim Angels for seven years.
Family.
His daughter, Emily Smith Miller-Mundy (1943-2013), was a prominent figure in the Tulsa Sound music scene, and the inspiration for Leon Russell's song "Sweet Emily".

Marathon Dam

The Marathon Dam is a gravity dam on the Charadros River, near its junction with the Varnavas Stream, west of Marathon and northeast of Athens in Greece. The dam created Lake Marathon for the primary purpose of municipal water supply. Constructed between 1926 and 1929, it was the sole supplier of water to Athens until 1959. The dam is often cited for its role in the modernization of Greece and the first recorded case of seismic activity associated with reservoir inundation. It was also designed to be symbolic of Ancient Greece, particularly Athenians and the Battle of Marathon.
Background.
The Marathon Dam was originally proposed, designed, funded and tendered in 1918, but was declared illegal by Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, who succeeded Eleftherios Venizelos in late 1920, because there had been no public bidding for the project. With a strong influx of Greek refugees from Asia Minor following the defeat at the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 (the "Asia Minor Disaster") and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, which led to the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, Greek officials were searching for a means to supply Athens with more water. An estimated 1.3 million refugees were returning and the population of Athens would end up doubling between 1920 and 1928. At the time, Greece underwent a period of political turmoil that saw the fall of the monarchy and the establishment of a Second Hellenic Republic, as well as several military coups and counter-coups. Near the end of this period, all major water supply projects for Athens were reevaluated and a five-volume report was published. The report described the Marathon Dam as "the optimal solution" and the "last recourse" for Athens.
The dam was approved in 1923 and was to be implemented immediately. After a restricted public bidding, Ulen & Co. from New York was selected to construct the project. On December 22, 1924, Ulen signed a contract with the Greek government and the Bank of Athens to construct the dam. This included the dam, reservoir, a conveyance pipe and a water treatment plant. The Greek parliament also approved the project and legislated the creation of the Hellenic Water Company (EEY) to oversee construction and manage water for Athens, amongst other Greek cities. The project's cost exceeded that of the National Bank of Greece and was funded with a $10 million loan to be repaid to Ulen, who had considerably more financial backing to complete the average-sized project. Under EEY, a Ulen-controlled consortium with the Bank of Athens and the Greek Government was formed.
Construction.
The foundation stone for the dam was laid in October 1926 by Prime Minister Alexandros Zaimis; Venizelos was also present at the ceremony. With 450 workers, construction continued on the dam and water network for three years and in 1929, the reservoir began to fill. Work on the dam and water network was complete in May 1931. A year after inauguration, the Boyati Tunnel was transferring per second of water treated at the Galatsi Water Treatment Plant to Athens. The dam would serve as the primary water supply for Athens until 1959, when water was pumped from Yliki lake.
Seismicity.
During and after the filling of the Marathon Dam's reservoir, there was seismic activity, with all the epicenters being within of the reservoir. The first earthquakes were felt in 1931, with two 5+-magnitude earthquakes occurring in 1938. All but two of the earthquakes were believed to have occurred during rapid rises in the reservoir level. This seismic activity is the earliest known example of earthquakes being caused by reservoir filling.
Design.
The dam is a tall, long gravity dam with a crest width of and base width of . The dam's spillway is located near its southern abutment and is an uncontrolled chute-type with a discharge capacity. It is at an elevation of above sea level while the dam crest is at . The dam creates a reservoir with a maximum capacity of of which is usable. The reservoir has a maximum depth of and surface area of 
The dam is located at the head of a drainage area with an average annual run-off of , of which is captured. Average rainfall in the basin is .
Symbolism.
The Marathon Dam was seen as a major symbol of modernization in Greece. The dam's location near Marathon signified a connection to Greece's past with the Athenians' victory at the Battle of Marathon, while its modern structure, the largest project in the Balkans at the time, signified a connection to the future and victory over nature. A replica of the Athenian Treasury temple at Delphi constructed at the base of the dam further illustrates the connection. A plaque on the temple reads: 
"To commemorate their victory at the battle of Marathon, the Athenians erected a treasury at Delphi. This building is a replica and commemorates a victory at Marathon in wrestling from nature its life giving water for the citizens of Athens."
The dam's face and visible structure were also covered in the same Pentelikon marble that was used to construct the Parthenon.

Career.
Nielsen played in her first international events in 2004, as an alternate for the Madeleine Dupont rink. Even though she was an alternate, she played many games. At the 2004 World Junior Curling Championships, the team finished 6th and at the 2004 Ford World Women's Curling Championship they finished in 8th. They finished in 8th place at the 2004 European Curling Championships.
Later that season, Nielsen was promoted to third on the team and they won a silver medal at the 2005 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival. She then played second on the team at the 2005 World Junior Curling Championships, where the rink finished 4th. At the 2005 World Women's Curling Championship, the rink finished in 10th.
The following season, Nielsen moved to play second for Dorthe Holm's rink. They won a bronze medal at the 2005 European Curling Championships and finished in 8th place at the 2006 Winter Olympics. Also that season, Nielsen skipped the Danish team to a bronze medal finish at the 2006 World Junior Curling Championships.
At this point, Nielsen left the main Danish team to form her own rink. At the 2007 European Curling Championships, she skipped Denmark to a bronze medal. At the 2010 European Curling Championships, she skipped Denmark to a 5th place finish.
In 2011, Nielsen won her first World Curling Tour event at the International Bernese Ladies Cup. She also won the Danish national championships for the first time as a skip, which gave her the right to represent Denmark at the 2011 Capital One World Women's Curling Championship in Esbjerg.

Osip Minor

Osip Solomonovich Minor (; 1861–1932) was a Russian revolutionary and member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.
Minor was born in Minsk (now in Belarius, then part of Minsk Governorate, Russian Empire). His father was Rabbi Solomon Minor, and many of his ancestors had been rabbis as well.
Revolutionary politics.
Minor became involved in revolutionary politics while studying at the University of Moscow. He joined the party of 'People's Will' in the early 1880s. In 1883 he was arrested for the first time, and again in 1885. In 1887 he received a sentence of ten years hard labour in Siberia. On March 22, 1889, he participated in a prisoners' uprising in Yakutsk and was condemned to death by hanging, but the sentence was commuted to hard labour for life.
In 1896 he was released but forbidden to live in European Russia. That restriction was eased in 1898; he was merely forbidden to live in St. Petersburg or Moscow.
Vilna revolutionary movement.
Around 1900 he settled in Vilna (now Vilnius in Lithuania). He became active in the revolutionary movement in Vilna, but gravitated toward Narodnik circles rather than to the Marxist Bund because they seemed to him to be more revolutionary. He was affiliated with the mainly Jewish Socialist-Revolutionary Workers' Party for the Political Liberation of Russia, organised by Mark Natanson.
PSR.
In 1901, Minor travelled abroad and assisted in the unification of various Socialist-Revolutionary groups in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR). He returned to Russia and worked for the PSR in various capacities and participated in the Revolution of 1905. In 1909, Evno Azev, head of the PSR's 'Combat Organisation' and an agent of the Okhrana (secret police), betrayed Minor and had him arrested again, but by 1913 Minor had escaped from Siberia and was in Geneva, Switzerland, working with the organisation of Russian Socialis-Revolutionries Abroad. He seems to have returned to Russia but was captured. He was freed by the February Revolution of 1917.
World War I.
During the First World War Minor took a Defencist position, which put him at odds with the PSR leader Viktor Chernov and with his old associate Natanson.
In 1917 Minor became president of the Moscow City Duma. He opposed the Bolshevik October Revolution and supported attempts to set up an anti-Bolshevik democratic government.
Later years.

Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level

The Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (A-level) examination is held annually in Singapore. It is conducted jointly by the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE), Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) and the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). Being a collaboration between the MOE and UCLES, the Singaporean A-level is a different version of the international A-level. The A-level certificate is a qualification recognised internationally and valued by universities and employers alike. It allows Singaporean students to gain entry into local and overseas universities to further their education.
The examination is taken by students at the end of their second year for junior college students, and the third year for centralised institute students. Candidates are usually 18 or 19 years of age. 
In 2010, the number of school candidates who sat for the examination was 14,280, out of which 90.8% of them scored at least three Higher 2 (H2) passes, with a pass in General Paper (GP) or Knowledge and Inquiry (KI).
Curriculum.
The Singaporean A-level curriculum was revised and took effect starting from the year 2006, replacing the previous system of ‘AO’, ‘A’ and ‘S’ papers. It was designed to emphasise multi-disciplinary learning, breadth of learning as well as flexibility, and it aims to prepare students well for the approaches being taken in university education, and for the demands of an innovation-driven world of the 21st century.
Under the new curriculum, candidates select subjects from three levels of study, namely Higher 1 (H1), Higher 2 (H2) and Higher 3 (H3). Subjects are divided into knowledge skills and content-based subjects. Knowledge skills subjects include General Paper, Knowledge and Inquiry and Project Work; content-based subjects are divided into languages, humanities and the arts, and mathematics and sciences.
Subject combination.
Students may opt to elect any combination and number of H1 and H2 subjects but are invariably required to sit for either H1 General Paper or H2 Knowledge and Inquiry.
Under the Ministry of Education's regulations, students sitting for the A-level in a junior college are required to take at least one subject that is from a contrasting discipline. They are also required to fulfill additional academic requirements of Singapore's education system, such as having to take Project Work and a Mother Tongue Language.
Grading.
H1 and H2 subjects are graded alphabetically in the following manner.
Notes:
H3 subjects are graded as either Distinction, Merit, Pass or Ungraded.

Nightjohn (film)

Nightjohn is a 1996 television comedy movie about a young slave girl who lives a hopeless life on a Southern plantation. Her job is to take care of the white family’s son as well as spitting tobacco on the roses to keeps bugs away. Her life is changed when she is taught how to read by a fellow slave. The slave, John, says that learning to read is freedom because slavery is bounded by laws and deeds which the slaves cannot read. Her excitement towards reading gets her and her fellow slaves in trouble with their master, Mr. Waller, who prohibits any slave from being able to read. When trouble ensues, Sarny uses her ability to read against Mr. Waller and saves the lives of the rest of the slaves. She ends up being sold, but not before she shows her fellow slaves the letter ‘A’.
Plot.
Sarny is born in the white house. Their master, Clel Waller, walks in and becomes angry when he realizes that it is a girl, instead of a boy. He states that a boy is worth a thousand dollars while a girl is worth nothing. Later when Sarny becomes a child, her mother is sold and is then taken care of by another slave, Dealey. 
Sarny grows up and starts working on the plantation. Back at the house, Outlaw tries to get Dealey to convince Clel, to give him a pass so he can marry a girl named Egypt from another plantation. Dealey is preparing a dress for Sarny, when goes to work at the house. Sarny is in charge of taking care of the Waller's young son, Homer, who is just a toddler and not 'housebroken' or potty trained. 
The family and slaves then go to church, with Sarny standing in front with Homer. After the service, the Wallers have guests over for lunch and Clel discusses the fact that his cotton is worth a lot of money. During the luncheon Calle, Clel’s wife, brings up that one of the slave boys wants to court a girl from another plantation. Clel immediately refuses stating that if they were to have a baby, it would give money to the wife’s plantation instead of his. Calle asks why things cannot just be about love. Hearing Clel’s rejection of the marriage, Sarny accidentally drops the plate of food, and is punished when Clel forces Calle to slap the girl. That night, Dealey tells Sarny to behave otherwise she will have to do the hard labor out in the fields. Sarny replies that one day, she is going to own Mr. Waller. 
The next day, Calle tells Sarny to take a letter to the doctor’s place. On the way, she sees a slave trader, Tom, herding black slaves toward the Waller household. At the doctor’s house, the doctor asks Sarny to take a letter to Calle, but to keep it a secret from Clel. He then gives Sarny a penny for her troubles. Back at the plantation, Tom is willing to sell a slave to Clel for 500 dollars. Clel then questions Tom about why he is willing to sell a slave worth $3000 for only $500, wondering if the slave is trouble. Clel then tells the slave to take off his shirt, revealing many scars from being whipped. Clel says that instead, he will buy the man off of Tom for only 50 dollars. 
That night, while asking for tobacco, the slave begins to talk to Sarny. He tells her that he can trade her letters for tobacco, meaning he can teach her to read. He explains that she has to learn the alphabet before she learns to read and that each letter has a different meaning and shows her the letter ‘A’. She then introduces herself to the slave and the slave says that his name is ‘John’. Sarny then starts to read the letter ‘A’ in the letters between the doctor and Calle that she delivers. 
The next morning, Outlaw is being punished because he snuck out the previous night to see Egypt. As he is about to whip Outlaw, Arthur, Clel’s son asks him to stop because they are friends. Clel then explains to Arthur that the slaves were made to pick his cotton instead of being his friend and then proceeds to whip Outlaw. Sarny states that Clel watched everyone instead of the one person he needed to watch, his wife.
That night when the Wallers are having a party, Dealey walks in on John teaching Sarny the alphabet and is outraged. She questions John about the scars on his back and he says that they were because he had tried to run away twice. The third time however, he successfully got away to the North but ended up coming back in order to teach slaves how to read. Dealey prohibits John from teaching Sarny to read because she does not want anyone to be whipped. John agrees but says that Dealey is teaching Sarny the wrong thing about being afraid. Sarny states that she will just learn how to read by herself.
Seeing Calle refuse an invitation from the doctor, Sarny suggests that Calle take both her and Homer along with her. She convinces Calle that she can watch the boy so no one would get mad. When the slaves come home from work, they find a cake on the table and accuses Sarny of stealing it. She states that Calle gave it to her but also that she did steal something. She reveals that she had stolen Homer’s alphabet blocks angering joe. joe says that he is willing to turn whoever is teaching letters in because Clel would kill them if he found out. He states that words are nothing which causes John to shout that words are freedom. He explains that the while folks keep the words to themselves and that if the slaves had words, they would be free. Outlaw then asks Joe what he knows about words which Joe responds by reciting the alphabet and then showing that it had cost him a finger. Later that night, John writes Sarny’s name in the dirt saying that the letters meant her. Sarny then questions John about read the paper, asking him how he knows that he is reading and not just making up stories. 
The next day, Clel recruits everyone in his family to help with picking cotton from the fields because that is his source of income. He promises a feast to everyone if they are successful with the crop. While Sarny and Homer are playing, she stumbles across Clel’s record book and tried to read it. This makes her angry at John accusing him of not teaching her the entire alphabet. He explains to her that those are instead numbers and that he will teach her everything he knows. Dealey then agrees to learn as well. While they are at church, Sarny is overcome with tears because she is able to read the bible prompting the priest to baptize her. 
After being baptized, it is revealed that Sarny had stolen the bible that Jeffery was supposed to take care of which gets him in trouble. She discovers that she had been lied to and that God was on the slave’s side. As Sarny begins to read more and more, the rest of the slaves reject it and tell her to stop. She begins to read a story in the Gazette newspaper about a slave revolt, capturing the other slaves’ attention. Sarney then tricks Homer into playing hide and seek so she can go back and read Clel’s record book. The Wallace plantation had a good crop of cotton this year and as promised, Clel throws a feast. The slaves use this opportunity to let Outlaw and Egypt get married.
It is discovered later that Egypt is pregnant and is forced to run away. John forges Clel’s signature for Outlaw and his wife so they can escape. In doing so, Jeffery comes in the slaves’ house to thank Outlaw for helping out with his father, but then discovers the stolen bible. Having his feeling hurt, Arthur questions the slaves about who had taken the bible and Dealey takes the blame for Sarny. Having told his father, Clel tries to figure out who had taken the bible because he knows that Dealey did not take it. With no one confessing, he then tells his son to whip Dealey. Reluctant at first, he is overcome with anger and whips Dealey. As he is tries to continue, he is stopped by John who says that he was the one who took it. This results in Clel chopping off John’s finger as punishment. When asked if he had learned his lesson, John says yes but then begins to write the alphabet in the dirt. Clel then attempts to shoot John but Jeffery hits him in the head with a gun instead, telling his father that he will take care of it. He tells the other to sell John and get him off his property. As he is leaving, John tells Sarny that she knows what she must now do, which is to forge the other note. When he leaves, Joe asks Sarny what John had writing in the dirt and Sarny replies that he had written “John”. Sarny is then seen forging the second note for Outlaw and telling them to name their baby John if it was a boy.
The next morning, when Sarny goes to deliver the book back to the doctor, instead of putting it on the table, she put it in its right spot on the shelf. She then hands the pennies back to the doctor saying that she cannot keep his secrets anymore. Confused, the doctor then realizes that Sarny had meant when he realizes that Sarny had put the book in the right place. The doctor then hurries to the church where Clel and his man are also going. Clel interrupts the service saying that he had found two notes written and signed with his name in two different handwritings. He states that the first slave had been sold and is now looking for the second. When no one answers, Clel says that he will shoot all of his slaves. As he starts to count to three, Sarny finishes it saying “3”. She then says that Clel would not shoot them because they are worth money. Since Clel had lost everything in the cotton fields, the slaves are now his wealth. Sarny explains to Clel that she is worth the most to him because of what she knows. Sarny tells Calle to say what she has to say to Clel but she insists that she does not know what Sarny is talking about and tells Clel to shoot the girl. Clel refuses saying that he wants to know what Sarny is talking about. The doctor then intervenes saying that he is to blame. He lies and says that he had taught Egypt how to read simple things and that Egypt had then taught Sarny. Thinking everything had been solved; Calle tells Clel that she wants Sarny to be sold. Sarny being sold and explains that there is a bit of John in all of them.
History.
Nightjohn is a movie that depicts the lives of African American slaves in the antebellum South. Literacy plays an important part in the struggle for power between the slaves and their masters. The idea of keeping slaves illiterate was a tool for white Southerners’ to keep the slaves subordinate. Without the ability to read, slaves were often tricked into doing things that they did not want to do. They weren’t able to read the laws or deeds that affected their future and resulted in them becoming slaves. After the civil war had ended, there was a problem pertaining to what to do for the African American people. With slavery’s stabilizing influence gone, the Freedmen's Bureau was created to remedy the situation. It proposed that they should educate the former slaves and advance the reconciliation between the North and the South. They also hoped that it would create a lasting peace and order between the different races. The bureau also sought to create schoolhouses in order to regain the stability lost by the end of slavery.

Hsinbyume Pagoda

The Hsinbyume Pagoda ( ; also known as Myatheindan Pagoda ( )) is a large pagoda on the northern side of Mingun in Sagaing Region in Myanmar, on the western bank of the Irrawaddy River. It is approximately 10 km northwest of Mandalay and is located in the proximity of the Mingun Pahtodawgyi. The pagoda is painted white and is modeled on the physical description of the Buddhist mythological mountain, Mount Meru.
Construction.
The pagoda was built in 1816 by Bagyidaw. It is dedicated to the memory of his first consort and cousin, Princess Hsinbyume (, lit. Princess White Elephant, 1789–1812) who had died in childbirth in a site nearby.
Design.
The pagoda's design is a great departure from Burmese pagoda design norms. It is based on descriptions of the mythical Sulamani pagoda on Mount Meru, and the lower parts of the pagoda represent the mountain. Seven concentric terraces represent the seven mountain ranges going up to the Mount Meru according the Buddhist mythology.
Restoration.
The pagoda was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1836 and was restored by King Mindon in 1874.

L'Escargot (TV series)

"L'Escargot" is a 2012 Hong Kong television drama inspired by the 2009 Chinese television drama "Dwelling Narrowness". It is produced by Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) under executive producer Nelson Cheung, and was filmed with a single-camera setup. A costume fitting was held on 20 September 2010. A blessing ceremony was held on 14 October 2010 where production started and ended in January 2011.
Overview.
In Hong Kong, many people work their entire lives to achieve their dream of owning their own house. Handyman Kwan Ka-On (Michael Miu) and his family have struggled for years living in a cramped apartment and it seems they have almost reached their goal. However, Ka-On's dream is threatened by a number of troubling circumstances relating to his family. Because Ka-On is the eldest son of his family, he has an overdeveloped sense of responsibility towards others, which hurts his wife Long-Kiu (Sonija Kwok), especially when they are forced to live apart from their daughter.
Meanwhile, Ka-On's selfish and greedy sister-in-law, Lau Siu-Lan (Mandy Wong) encourages her husband Ka-Hong (Oscar Leung) to take advantage of his older brother to obtain a house without spending any money of their own, especially after Ka-Hong injures his leg. Ka-On's sister Ka-Lok (Linda Chung), a public relations agent, finds herself entangled in affairs of property developer and real estate agent Ko Wang-Chim (Michael Tse). Her budding relationship drives a wedge between Ka-Lok and her long-time boyfriend, Ting Koon Fung (Ron Ng), who turns to Ko Wang-Chim's shy and sheltered younger sister, Joyce (JJ Jia), and earns the ire of Ko Wang-Chim's wife, Lee Man Wah (Joyce Tang). Finally, Ka-On's youngest brother, Ka-Wing (Him Law) manages to find a stable job, but is frustrated by his independent and overbearing girlfriend Buk-King's attempts to ensure that they have a stable and comfortable future together. 
Despite everyone's problems, the family is held together by Ka-On's tireless mother (Angelina Lo). However, when something unimaginable happens to her, it threatens to turn everyone against one another.
Story.
The story is primarily about the inter-connected trials of the Kwan, Ting, and Ko family in life, money, and romance. Kwan Ka-On (Michael Miu) is the eldest brother of the Kwan family. He's husband to Sze Long-Kiu (Sonija Kwok) and father to Kwan Hau-Lam (Lam Chi Nok). Living as a construction worker, he lives job-to-job based on the contracts he gets from clients. He and his family would develop an unusual tie with Ko family after working with them and getting intertwined in their affairs. 
Ko Wang-Chim (Michael Tse) is CEO of his own company, Ting Chim Real Estates. He's interested in seizing depreciated estates and gaining big returns through major building renovations and selling them off to upper-class buyers. In between, his wife, Lee Man-Wah (Joyce Tang) had hired Ka-On and his crew for a major renovation project upon their new mansion. Things become complicated when Ka-On's second brother, Kwan Ka-Hong (Oscar Leung), got injured due to Wang-Chim.
Ka-Hong and his pregnant wife (first grandson to the Kwan family), Lau Siu-Lan (Mandy Wong), lived in one of the very estates that Wang-Chim wanted to buy, rebuild, and re-sell. Originally, Wang-Chim dispatched his personal assistant to help finalize the contracts and would pay Ka-Hong a large favorable sum of money. Unfortunately, Siu-Lan's shrewd and greedy nature wasn't satisfied with the amount. She felt that Ka-Hong should've haggled more as she knows Wang-Chim wants the building badly. To that end, Ka-Hong relented to his wife and he canceled the contract signing. 
Ka-Hong then started public protests to incite unfairness and claimed Wang-Chim was a cheater. Both husband and wife tried to pressure Wang-Chim by attempting to humiliate and pressure him to reimbursed them with more money. Unfortunately, Wang-Chim wasn't pleased with the results and asked his assistant to help him take care of the problem. The assistant dispatched low-level thugs to threaten and scare the couple, but things turned awry when Ka-Hong foolishly attempted to chase down the thugs and accidentally got run over by their getaway car. He was left with a severely damaged leg and required surgery. Unfortunately, Ka-Hong has strong fears against surgery and refuses surgery while crying to have his leg fixed. 
When Ka-On learned of his brother's injuries, he confronted Wang-Chim over the matter; Wang-Chim denied personal involvement in his brother's injuries, but offered a large check as a gesture of goodwill to Ka-On. Being a man of old fashioned principles, Ka-On refused the check as he felt this was "hush money" and an insult to him and stormed off. Although the meeting was very tense, Wang-Chim was impressed by Ka-On's sense of nobility in the matter.
In between this time, Ka-On's little sister, Kwan Ka-Lok (Linda Chung), also met Wang-Chim through a near car collision. Ka-Lok was spending time with her boyfriend, Ting Koon-Fung (aka Big Ding, Ron Ng). They just finished their night together and bought a new pair of shoes. Wang-Chim nearly hit her while on the road, but was fine; her shoes on the other hand was badly damaged. Feeling bad over the matter, Wang-Chim wrote a very large check over such low-grade shoes and she never cashed the check. Upon seeing him again, she returned his check and Wang-Chim was impressed by her honesty and unselfish nature and began keeping in contact with her through her PR company, Only You (a company he later buys to keep ties with Ka-Lok), collaborated with his for a series of real estate PR projects.
Because of Ka-Hong's incident, relations between the Kwans and Wang-Chim became tense. To save his brother's right leg without surgery, Ka-On ventured to inner-China in attempt to find a famous Chinese healer that applied non-evasive methods of healing his injuries. When Wang-Chim also heard about Ka-On's mission, he decided to quietly intervene by pressuring the doctor to help heal Ka-Hong. However, Siu-Lan wasn't satisfied over the situation as she blamed Ka-On for their misfortunes (even though it was her fault) and guilt-tripped Ka-On into covering all their medical bills, including letting them move back into the clan's cramped apartment. With Ka-Hong on the road to recovery, things between Wang-Chim were repaired after Ka-On learned he helped convince the doctor to save his brother's leg. 
Life at the cramped up apartment wasn't great. With so many bills to cover, including his brother's, Ka-On worked very hard on multiple projects for extended periods of time with little food. In between this time, life at the house became more and more challenging as Siu-Lan's laziness, selfishness, and narcissism affected the peace. Whenever other family members fight with her over her misdeeds, she would always fake pregnancy pains to avert any punishment. Ka-Hong himself became somewhat emotionally unstable and depressed due to the fact they had no income and no resources to escape their current situation. When the family learned of his situation, the youngest brother, Kwan Ka-Wing (Him Law), decided to pitch in with his therapy and psychiatry sessions. 
The turning point was when Ka-On developed bad ulcers and finally coughed up blood (due to him straining the limits of his health for money). Ka-On didn't want to worry their mother and asked those that knew of his situation to remain quiet, however, Siu-Lan just had to bad-mouth Ka-On, saying he was probably doing something unfaithful and it earned the rage of the Kwan siblings. Ka-Hong slapped his own wife, Ka-Lok tearfully said she didn't know what was going on, and Ka-Wing called her a bitch. Afterwards, Siu-Lan apologized for her behavior and promised to improve, however, she merely toned down her bad habits. 
Afterwards, to avoid further family troubles, Ka-On and his family decided to move out. With his recent contracts with Wang-Chim, he nearly saved enough money to buy a flat for his family. To hasten time, the couple agreed to send their daughter to her maternal grandparents while the two live in a small apartment until they finally saved enough to buy a flat. However, adjustment was difficult as Long-Kiu often missed her daughter. Long-Kiu would later meet Paul (an old colleague and Ka-On's rival for Long-Kiu's affection in the past) and he offered her a position in his bank to help her out.
Due to the constant money problems Ka-Hong experienced, he tried to find ways to make money despite his on-going recovery. He thought he finally struck big when overheard a business man making good money by selling and distributing tiles; he wants part of the action. Using the very money Ka-On gave him to help him recover, he lost it all after finding out he was scammed and was threatened to be sued without proper compensation. Siu-Lan wanted to tell this matter to Ka-On, hoping he'll save them again, but Ka-Hong was against it, feeling he owes too much to his brother already and they recently purchased a beautiful flat; telling Ka-On now would ruin everything.
Ka-Lok learned of the situation and asked Big Ding to help out. Sensing his girlfriend's desperation, he made a huge risk by following unreliable stock sources from his friend and he ended up owing people large sums of money as well. Feeling more desperate over the situation, Ka-Lok despaired and Wang-Chim came to the rescue. Using his vast wealth, he hired Big Ding on a trial basis for helping him invest in stocks; little did he know that Wang-Chim used his money to increase the value of the stocks to help save himself from debt and equally his pride. Wang-Chim also used his wealth to help save Ka-Hong and the family was saved from financial collapse once again. 
Through all of this, Ka-Lok started to develop romantic feelings for Wang-Chim. However, she's not the kind of girl that goes after married men and she remained faithful to Big Ding until one major incident. Wang-Chim was presume dead after his scheduled flight on board a plane crashed and all hands were presumed dead. However, Wang-Chim lived and found a tearfully joyed Ka-Lok within his office. Seizing the moment, Wang-Chim told her not to lie to herself, that they both have feelings for each other. Unable to resist Wang-Chim, the two slept together and it would be the prelude of worse things to come.
Feeling severely guilty in sleeping with Wang-Chim, Ka-Lok convinced Big Ding to get married. Even though things were looking great, Ka-Lok's guilt over her infidelity was affecting her. She confided to Long-Kiu over what happened, explaining her debt to Wang-Chim was too great and she felt only her body was the only thing she can give him; it was guilt-sex and she thought about admitting it to Big Ding, but Long-Liu was against it. She warned Ka-Lok that Big Ding hates liars and event worst, infidelity (due to his father cheating on his mother and having an illegitimate son); keeping it a secret is the only way to have a happy life with Big Ding. Unfortunately, Wang-Chim wouldn't let Ka-Lok go. He confronted Ka-Lok outside her building and tried to convince her they belonged to each other. Sadly, Big Ding saw and heard the whole thing and ragingly left in tears and shock, ending their relationship.
With the help of Paul, Long-Kiu had an advantage over the other bank clerks and she quickly rose to the top. She even fought for early benefit rights to buy flats through her employee benefits package. The only thing left was to use the money they saved so hard to buy the flat. When Ka-On learned what happened to Ka-Lok, he was furious and he confronted Wang-Chim. He punched him and threw back the profits ($300,000 HK) he made from Wang-Chim as his way of severing all ties with him. However, that only threatened his own family. The recent flat they acquired was involved in a bitter battle between the former owners. After resolving their squabbles, they agreed to return the flat for them with some extra profit money to boot; the search for a new home continues. Unfortunately, Long-Kiu exploded in rage when she found out Ka-On threw away their hard-earned money for the sake of dignity against Wang-Chim. Only after some groveling that Long-Liu forgave Ka-On and the couple restarted saving again.
Meanwhile, Big Ding is at his lowest. Suffering from the emotional pain from Ka-Lok, he become a drunk and lost his job. He earlier unknowingly befriended Wang-Chim's little sister, Joyce Ko, and she saved him from hurting himself at his darkest hour. Because she liked him, she begged her brother to allow Big Ding to work in his company. Still enraged over recent events, he feels working at Wang-Chim's company would give him a chance to get some revenge.
Big Ding began manipulating Joyce's feelings for him to play in his favor. Whenever Ka-Lok would be around, he would use Joyce to display his romantic affections and would hurt Ka-Lok's feelings as she still wants him back. In between the time, Wang-Chim actively chased after Ka-Lok behind his wife's back. Things between Ka-Lok and Big Ding went for the worst when he made good money and bought a large house. At his house warming party, he invited Ka-Lok and used Joyce to show she's the new woman in his life. Unable to bear the two together, Big Ding confronted Ka-Lok outside and told her he too can make big money and wants her to experience a taste of his pain of what she did to him. Horrified at the level of hatred and vengeance he's willing to take, Ka-Lok called for Wang-Chim to take her away and she slept with him for a second time in an emotionally devastated state.
Back at Big Ding's new home, Joyce gave him back his house keys and said the show was over. She revealed she knew she was being manipulated and didn't mind if it meant to make Big Ding happy. She admitted she had feelings for him and thought being his puppet would make him feel better, but it didn't as everything he did to this point only made him feel miserable. After a night of deep reflection, Big Ding went to see Joyce again, apologizing for his actions. He realized Joyce was the best thing to happen to him and he decided to let things go to be with Joyce. However, it was not without incurring the wrath of Wang-Chim.
In between this time, Man-Wah took notice of her husband's late night activities when he began lying about his whereabouts; she knew he was having an affair, but kept it quiet in hopes he would realize she's the only one for him. Unfortunately, things didn't improve. She later discovered the 3rd person was Ka-Lok and confronted her over the matter. Believing she was a woman that just wanted something out of Wang-Chim's fortune, she offered to bribe Ka-Lok with money and/or position if she stayed away from her husband. However, Ka-Lok never wanted such things and she explained it was Wang-Chim that always went after her, but also had trouble refusing his advances. Man-Wah got angry and slapped Ka-Lok, she furious to know she's losing her husband to a woman who don't even know what she wants, at least a greedy mistress is in it for the money. She reminded what it means to be a mistress, a woman who can't even lift her head up in society and warned her to stay away; Ka-Lok decided to stay away and hide back at the family apartment until things blow over, but she had to go to Wang-Chim once again. 
Ka-On's money problems were large and Ting Hoi, Big Ding's dad and Ka-On's master, thought he could help ease his disciple's troubles by buying cheaper materials. However, things got messy when he left the job to see his sickened illegitimate son in China on short notice. In his haste, he failed to properly notify Ka-On that he loosened one of the windows and it fell right over, injuring a bystander. The police charged him with reckless endangerment, but also discovered the construction materials used was stolen goods and he might face jail time for illegally using stolen goods. Ka-On knew it was his master's unintentional fault and decided to keep quiet over the matter; it would mean jail time for him. When Ting Hoi learned of this, he tried to turn himself in as he tried to do the right thing and save his disciple, but things worked out as the original dealer was jailed. Little did they know that it was because Ka-Lok went to see Wang-Chim and he used his wealth once again to dig them out of trouble. Multiple events would later collide as things begin falling into full circle.
Ka-On became jealous of his wife's late night activities with Paul. Long-Kiu was securing banking contracts by courting potential clients through Paul, but Ka-On felt insecure about the matter. When he saw Long-Liu taking a drunken Paul back to his apt, he thought the worse and accused her of having an affair. Tired of his attitude, she ran back to her parent's home and Ka-On unsuccessfully tried to beg her back. After intercepting her at her parent's door, she suggested separating as she couldn't tolerate his behavior anymore. She said she was tired of her being second priority as Ka-On would do whatever he can for friends and family, except for his own wife's and daughter's interest. Ka-On tried to reason with his wife, but at the same time, Mah-Wah demanded his attention over exposing her knowledge of his sister's relationship with her husband; he once again chose his family over his wife. 
Infuriated that his little sister maintained a relationship with Wang-Chim, he confronted her during a family dinner and slapped her for her foolishness. However, Ka-On got slapped back by their mother and asked was he even sure over the situation. Mother Kwan then sat Ka-On down and warned him that his concerns over other people is causing a serious rift with his wife and it's better to tend to his personal matters than worrying over his little sister. Being the dutiful son, he listened and left it alone. Eventually, family life would improve again. In a time of temporary peace, Ka-On managed to convince his wife to come join him in the clan's big family dinner gathering and the whole family was looking forward to dinner with mom until they found her on the floor. Mother Kwan had suffered a stroke and couldn't be saved.
The entire Kwan family was devastated over losing their matriarch and Ka-On developed an eye condition due to the stress of everything. His eyes began to see the world like film negatives and the doctor warned him it's a serious condition and may lead to blindness. However, he kept things quiet to his family. The family started to divide up the precious mementos of their mother and things got heated when Ka-Hong and Siu-Lan wanted Ka-On to sign a legal document to release ownership of the flat to them. The other siblings were infuriated that Siu-Lan would pick such a time to battle ownership of the flat and it put the siblings at odds as Ka-Hong and Siu-Lan refused to give and claimed that Mother Kwan agreed to give it up to them. Tired of sacrificing all he ever earned in life, Ka-On refused to sign the flat over.
Ka-On would eventually tell his wife about his eye problems. He no longer wishes to battle things with his wife and the two reconciled their relationship. Seeing how he was to fight over the flat, she actually reminded him he wasn't like this to family before and he should reconsider things due to risk-escalation with Ka-Hong. Eventually, Ka-On found a quiet old house at a rural area in HK and decided to buy and rebuild the place as his own; he planned to give the flat to Ka-Hong as intended. Long-Kiu decided to move back with Ka-On and agreed to restart life with him in the new house, but things got hard once again when there was a dispute over land ownership. Although they bought the land from the owner, one of the relatives claimed it was not legit and demanded his land back and caused a fight. It resulted with Ka-On suffering a head injury from getting hit by one of his assailants. 
In between, it was discovered that Ka-Hong had serious money troubles again and intended to leverage the flat to save themselves. Outraged by what has happened, Long-Kiu lectured Ka-Hong and Siu-Lan over the sacrifices Ka-On has made for them and their ungrateful behavior. Elsewhere, Wang-Chim's affair and controlling nature over his family got out of control. Joyce ran off to be independent of her brother and to be with Big Ding, but Wang-Chim always tried to ways to make his life difficult or tempt him with a bribe to get him to break things off, but never worked. Mah-Wah went through very difficult times to get herself pregnant, hoping the baby would convince him to break things off with Ka-Lok, but that never happened and she lost the baby.
In an attempt to regain control if his world, Wang-Chim confronted Big Ding and offered him riches if he stayed away from Joyce, but he refused. Then the subject of Ka-Lok came and it was finally revealed that Ka-Lok used her body to save both him and her family and not because she was a money-loving cheater. Big Ding panicked in a rage and guilt when he realized he caused that much pain to Ka-Lok. He ended up in a bad car crash and was later recovered thanks to Ka-Lok's efforts to find him.
Wang-Chim started to become desperate as his world started to fall apart. His wife decided to ruin his life by destroying his fortune. Just so happens, one of his big co-investors is a good friend to Man-Wah and he convinced other investors to opt out on his recent business plans to punish his misdeeds. He then tried to reconcile with Ka-Lok, saying he wants to marry her to prove his love for her, but she got tired of him and told him to wake up from his illusions. Not willing to lose his empire, he caused a fire in attempt to salvage his investments, but it resulted in several lives. He was ultimately charged with arson and sent to jail.
In the finality of the story, family peace would finally come as Ka-On's eye condition was miraculously recovered from that head injury he got earlier. Ka-Hong and his family informed him that they worked things out with the landowner of his new home and the couple agreed to live there from now on as tenants to him; Ka-On was happy to know that their mother's flat now belongs to them. In a private meeting between Ka-Lok and Joyce, Ka-Lok felt that too many things happened between her and Big Ding, that those irreversible changes would always scar their relationship; she bowed out in hopes Joyce and Big Ding would have a great life together. Ka-Lok would eventually move overseas to study and restart life. Wang-Chim would ultimately reconcile with his wife and even though in jail, she intends to wait for his release. Sometime later, the Kwan family would be reunited in a big family dinner, celebrating their lives and each other.

Freddy Galvis

Freddy Jose Galvis (born November 14, 1989) is a Venezuelan Major League Baseball shortstop and second baseman for the Philadelphia Phillies.
Professional career.
Galvis began his professional career in 2007 with the Williamsport Crosscutters, with whom he hit .203 with nine stolen bases in 38 games. In 2008, with the Lakewood Blue Claws, Galvis hit .238 with 14 stolen bases in 127 games. He split 2009 between the GCL Phillies, Clearwater Threshers and Reading Phillies, hitting a combined .240 in 86 games. He hit .233 with 15 stolen bases with Reading in 2010.
In 2011, at age 21, Galvis had his best year to date. Always known as an excellent defender, but mediocre hitter, he was finally able to gain some ground at the plate, thanks in part to a much more rigorous off-season conditioning regimen. Starting the year in AA with the Reading Phillies, Galvis hit .273, with 35 RBI, in 464 plate appearances across 104 games. After an especially torrid stretch at the plate in May, Galvis was promoted to the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs. While there, he hit .298, with 8 RBI, 126 plate appearances across 33 games. Between AA and AAA, his combined line for the year was .278/.324/.392 with 8 home runs, 43 RBI, 78 runs, and 23 stolen bases in 137 games. His excellent numbers were enough to earn the 2011 Paul Owens Award, which is given to the best position player and pitcher, respectively, in the Philadelphia Phillies minor league system. At the end of the 2011 season, Galvis was sent to the Venezuelan Winter League, and despite a brief ganglion cyst injury, played there until December 1.
Major league career.
On March 19, 2012, with Chase Utley scheduled to miss time due to a knee injury, Phillies General Manager Ruben Amaro, Jr. announced that Galvis would be the team's starting second baseman on Opening Day. Galvis recorded his first Major League hit in his fourth career game on April 9, a 2-RBI double off of Miami Marlins pitcher Aníbal Sánchez.
After spending two months as the Phillies' starting second baseman, Galvis injured his back on June 8 and was placed on the Disabled List five days later. On June 19, Galvis was suspended for 50 games after testing positive for Performance Enhancing Drugs.
In 2013, Galvis hit two walk-off home runs. The first one came off Aroldis Chapman on May 19, and the other came off Freddy Garcia on September 7. He ended the year with a .234 batting average, 6 home runs and 19 RBI.

Combat vehicle

A combat vehicle, also known as a ground combat vehicle, is a self-propelled, weaponized military vehicle used for combat operations. Combat vehicles can be wheeled or tracked.
History.
Ancient.
The chariot is a type of carriage using animals (almost always horses) to provide rapid motive power. Chariots were used for war as "battle taxis" and mobile archery platforms, as well as other pursuits such as hunting or racing for sport, and as a chief vehicle of many ancient peoples, when speed of travel was desired rather than how much weight could be carried. The original chariot was a fast, light, open, two-wheeled conveyance drawn by two or more horses that were hitched side by side. The car was little more than a floor with a waist-high semicircular guard in front. The chariot, driven by a charioteer, was used for ancient warfare during the bronze and the iron ages. Armor was limited to a shield.
Modern.
In the modern time, combat vehicle is protected by strong armour and armed with weapons, which combines operational mobility, tactical offensive, and defensive capabilities.
Design.
Automation.
The automation of human tasks endeavors to reduce the required crew size with improvements in robotics. Enhancements to automation can help achieve operational effectiveness with a smaller, more economical, combat vehicle force.
The automation of combat vehicles has proved to be difficult due to the time latency between the operator controlling the vehicle and the signal being received. Unlike air forces, ground forces must navigate the terrain and plan around obstacles. The rapid tactical implications of operating a weaponized vehicle in a combat environment are great.
Countermeasures.
Use of titanium armor on combat vehicles is increasing. The use of titanium can lighten the vehicle's weight.
Appliqué armor can be quickly applied to vehicles and has been utilized on the U.S. Army's M8 Armored Gun System.
Contemporary combat vehicles may incorporate a fire-suppression system to mitigate damage from fire. Systems can be employed in the engine and crew compartments and portable systems may be mounted inside and outside the vehicle as well.
Automatic fire suppression systems activate instantaneously upon the detection of fire and have been shown to significantly improve crew survivability. Halon fire suppression systems quickly inundate an affected fire breach with a flood of halon to extinguish leaking fuel. Halon remains necessary for crew compartment fire suppression due to space and weight constraints, and toxicity concerns. Nitrogen systems take up about twice as much space as a comparable halon unit. Germany uses this system as a replacement for its halon system. Some systems, such as Germany's previous extinguisher, have a second shot of suppressant to mitigate re-ignition or the effects of a second hit.
Though not as instantaneous, portable crew-operable extinguishers are also used inside and outside the vehicle. Typically, portable extinguishers use a CO2 agent instead of the halon agents used in the past. CO2 can become lethal to vehicle occupants if it accumulates into a deadly concentration. The U.S. Army has adopted a replacement formula consisting of 50% water, 50% potassium acetate. Alternatives such as powder formulas also exist.
Crew.
Hygiene upkeep is difficult when operating a combat vehicle.
Mobility.
Tracked combat vehicles are suited for heavy combat and rough terrain. Wheeled combat vehicles offer improved logistical mobility and optimized speeds on smooth terrain.
Silent watch is becoming an increasingly important combat vehicle application. It is a role that requires that all mission requirements be met while keeping acoustic and infrared signature levels to a minimum. For this reason, silent watch often requires the vehicle to operate without use of the main engine and sometimes even auxiliary engines. Many modern combat vehicles often have electronic equipment that cannot be supported solely with auxiliary batteries alone. Auxiliary fuel cells are a potential solution for covert operations.
Networking.
Force trackers are still not as prevalent as in the air force but still is an essential component of combat vehicles.
In the mid-'90s, U.S. weapon developers envisioned a sophisticated communication network where positions of enemy and friendly forces could be relayed to command vehicles and other friendly vehicles. Friendly vehicles could transmit enemy positions to friendly combat vehicles in combat range for efficient annihilation of the enemy. Logistics support could also monitor front-line combat vehicle fuel and ammunition statuses and move in to resupply depleted vehicles.
Weaponry.
Combat vehicles weapons are primarily designed for engaging other vehicles at long distances and are not optimized for destroying non-traditional targets like car bombs.

Philip L. Wright Zoological Museum

The Philip L. Wright Zoological Museum (UMZM) is a natural history facility and zoological collection located on the second floor of the Health Sciences building on the Missoula, Montana campus of the University of Montana. 
The UMZM is the largest zoological repository of its kind in the region. Its primary purpose is functioning as an active research facility that is open to all faculty, staff, and students of the university, while also giving tours to hobbyists as well as schools and educational groups. The museums collection consists of 14,500 mammalian, 7,000 avian, and 3,200 fish specimens. It is the largest museum of its kind between Eastern Washington University and Minneapolis, Minnesota, and houses one of the most extensive representations of Northern Rocky Mountain wildlife in the world. In addition to actively studying and documenting native species, the museum includes a wide variety of specimens from all over the globe, with the oldest dating from Leningrad, Russia, 1851. A volunteer curatorial assistant for the museum, Emily Graslie, hosted a series of videos on YouTube called "The Brain Scoop" exhibiting the various specimens the museum holds; the show has since moved to Chicago's Field Museum.
The University of Montana started its collections in the 1890s with contributions from such renowned individuals as Morton J. Elrod, who was an early founding biologist, professor, and researcher at the University of Montana, and who also founded the Flathead Lake Biological Research Station in 1899. On September 1, 1939, the museum came under the direction of Dr. Philip L. Wright, who adamantly pursued collections until his death in 1997. That same year the university renamed the museum in honor of Dr. Wright's diligent efforts. Until recently it was under the direction of curator David L. Dyer; it is otherwise staffed by volunteers.

Battle of Mohrungen

In the Battle of Mohrungen on 25 January 1807, most of a First French Empire corps under the leadership of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte fought a strong Russian Empire advance guard led by Major General Yevgeni Ivanovich Markov. The French pushed back the main Russian force, but a cavalry raid on the French supply train caused Bernadotte to call off his attacks. After driving off the cavalry, Bernadotte withdrew and the town was occupied by the army of General Levin August, Count von Bennigsen. The fighting took place in and around Morąg in northern Poland, which in 1807 was the East Prussian town of Mohrungen. The action was part of the War of the Fourth Coalition in the Napoleonic Wars.
After demolishing the army of the Kingdom of Prussia in a whirlwind campaign in October and November 1806, Napoleon's Grande Armée seized Warsaw. After two bitterly-fought actions against the Russian army, the French emperor decided to place his troops into winter quarters. However, in wintry weather, the Russian commander moved north into East Prussia and then struck west at Napoleon's left flank. As one of Bennigsen's columns advanced west it encountered forces under Bernadotte. The Russian advance was nearly at an end as Napoleon gathered strength for a powerful counterstroke.
Background.
After the Battle of Czarnowo on 23 December 1806 and the bloody battles of Pułtusk and Gołymin on 26 December, the opposing Russian and French armies went into winter quarters. Emperor Napoleon wanted time to reorganize the Grande Armée's logistical arrangements after their long autumn campaign. In addition, his veteran French troops had expressed displeasure at having to fight in Poland during the harsh winter weather.
In late 1806, Field Marshal Mikhail Kamensky's Russian army in Poland constituted two major wings under Generals Bennigsen and Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden (Buxhöwden). Bennigsen commanded Lieutenant General Alexander Ivanovich Ostermann-Tolstoy's 2nd Division, Lieutenant General Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken's 3rd Division, Lieutenant General Dmitry Golitsyn's 4th Division, and Lieutenant General Alexander Karlovich Sedmoratsky's 6th Division. The initial strength of Bennigsen's force, before the December battles, was 49,000 infantry, 11,000 regular cavalry, 4,000 cossacks, 2,700 artillerymen, 900 pioneers, and 276 guns. Of these, from 55,000 to 60,000 were able to take the field.
Buxhöwden led Lieutenant General Nikolay Tuchkov's 5th Division, Lieutenant General Dmitry Dokhturov's 7th Division, Lieutenant General Peter Kirillovich Essen's 8th Division, and Lieutenant General Heinrich Reinhold von Anrep's 14th Division. Buxhöwden's four divisions fought at the Battle of Austerlitz on 2 December 1805 and had not made up all the losses suffered at that engagement. Consequently, his troops numbered only 29,000 infantry, 7,000 cavalry, 1,200 gunners, and 216 artillery pieces in December 1806. Not counting garrisons, the Prussians could put only 6,000 men into the field in that month.
In 1806, the Russian field army consisted of 18 divisions. Each division included six 3-battalion infantry regiments, ten squadrons of heavy cavalry, ten squadrons of light cavalry, two heavy foot artillery batteries, three light foot artillery batteries, and one horse artillery battery. Since the foot batteries contained 14 guns apiece and the horse batteries 12 guns, each Russian division nominally controlled as many as 82 field pieces. Typically, the heavy batteries were made up of eight 12-pound cannons, four heavy howitzers, and two light howitzers. The light batteries had the same establishment except that they substituted 6- for 12-pound cannons. Horse batteries were entirely formed from 6-pound cannons.
"Old and worn out in body and mind", the 75-year old Marshal Kamensky exhibited clear signs that he was no longer fit to command. Around the time Pułtusk was fought, Kamensky left the front. The next day, he appeared in the streets of Grodno without his shirt on and called for a surgeon. Pointing out his many wounds, he demanded that the doctor give him a written statement that we was no longer able to serve. During December, his two lieutanants, of whom Buxhöwden was senior, began to intrigue against one another for the army command. After Pułtusk and Gołymin, the 8th and 14th Divisions remained with Bennigsen, who was not anxious to return them to their rightful wing commander. On 1 January 1807, Bennigsen's wing lay at Nowogród on the south bank of the ice-floe choked Narew River, while Buxhöwden's wing was to the northeast on the north bank. Around this time, Kamensky appeared at the front but his orders were ignored and he permanently withdrew from the campaign. His unstable and violent temperament eventually led to his murder at the hands of a peasant.
Napoleon deployed his corps in a wide arc on the east side of the Vistula River covering Warsaw. He posted Bernadotte's I Corps on the left flank with headquarters at Osterode (Ostróda). In order from left to right came Marshal Michel Ney's VI Corps at Mława, Marshal Nicolas Soult's IV Corps at Gołymin, Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps at Pułtusk, and Marshal Jean Lannes at Serock. Marshal Pierre Augereau's VII Corps stood in a reserve position behind the arc at Płońsk. Marshal Joachim Murat's Reserve Cavalry took up winter quarters in districts to the rear except for General of Division Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc's 4th Dragoon Division, which reported to Bernadotte, and General of Division Antoine Lasalle's Light Cavalry Division which patrolled Soult's front.
Russian offensive.
In a council of war on 2 January 1807, Buxhöwden and Bennigsen determined to take the offensive against the French. They intended to move north into East Prussia with seven divisions before turning west to attack Napoleon's left flank. The plan called for one division to remain northeast of Warsaw to distract the French. This division would soon be joined by two more that were due to arrive from Moldavia under the command of Lieutenant General Ivan Essen. Lieutenant Generals Dmitri Mikhailovich Volkonski (9th Division) and Petr Ivanovich Meller-Zakomelski (10th Division) led the two units. The Russian leaders hoped to damage Napoleon's left wing and force the French army to fall back to the west bank of the Vistula. The positions gained would be used to launch a spring campaign that might drive the French back to the Oder River.
Still jealous of his rival Buxhöwden, Bennigsen withdrew east to Tykocin with his six divisions rather than join his troops to the right wing of the army. He marched north for Goniądz where he found, to his delight, that Czar Alexander had appointed him army commander and recalled Buxhöwden. From there, he moved west to Biala Piska, arriving there on 14 January. Bennigsen left the 6th Division at Goniądz. Screened from Soult's cavalry screen by the Johannisburg Forest, Bennigsen's northward move into Masuria remained hidden from the French. The Prussian field force under General-Leutnant Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq withdrew northward to Rastenburg (Kętrzyn).
Meanwhile, Ney, finding his sector devoid of food and forage, disobeyed Napoleon's orders and advanced far northward in the direction of Königsberg. On the 11th his advance guard repulsed a Prussian attack on Schippenbeil (Sępopol). Three days later, Ney estimated that L'Estocq had 9,000 troops while General of Infantry Ernst von Rüchel garrisoned Königsberg with another 4,000. Livid at Ney for his insubordination, Napoleon nevertheless began to take measures in case the Russians reacted to the VI Corps leader's advance. He alerted Augereau to concentrate the VII Corps in readiness to march. The emperor also ordered Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre and the X Corps to protect Thorn (Toruń) and the lower Vistula.
On 19 January, the Russians finally appeared out of the forests, driving Ney's troops from Schippenbeil. After detaching 3,000 men to link with the 6th Division, Bennigsen commanded about 63,000 troops, while L'Estocq had 13,000 in the area. On the 21st, Bennigsen's advance elements were in Heilsberg (Lidzbark Warmiński) with L'Estocq on his right flank. The three Russian advance guards were led by Major Generals Markov, Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, and Karl Gustav von Baggovut. Though his cavalry under General of Brigade Auguste Francois-Marie de Colbert-Chabanais was roughly handled, Ney managed to escape southward to Neidenburg (Nidzica).
Having brushed aside Ney, the Russians bore down on Bernadotte's corps. On 24 January, Markov mauled a French unit at Liebstadt (Miłakowo), capturing 300 Frenchmen. Bernadotte quickly assembled General of Division Pierre Dupont's division and General of Brigade Jacques Léonard Laplanche's dragoons at Preussisch Holland (Pasłęk) on his left flank in the northwest. On his own initiative, Bernadotte's chief of staff General of Brigade Nicolas Joseph Maison alerted the I Corps center and right flank. Maison directed General of Division Olivier Rivaud to concentrate his division at Osterode on the right, while General of Division Jean-Baptiste Drouet gathered his troops at Saalfeld (Zalewo) in the center. Maison held General of Brigade Michel Marie Pacthod's 8th Light Infantry Regiment at Mohrungen, while calling Sahuc's other dragoon brigade from the right flank toward the center.
Battle.
At noon on 25 January, Markov approached Mohrungen with the right wing advance guard. From prisoners taken at Liebstadt, the Russian general knew that Bernadotte was concentrating at Mohrungen. In fact, the French marshal held the town with nine infantry battalions and 11 cavalry squadrons. This force comprised units of all three I Corps divisions, including the 8th Light Infantry of Rivaud's division plus elements of both Drouet's and Dupont's divisions. When Markov appeared, Bernadotte immediately advanced northward to engage his enemy. He ordered Dupont to march from Preussisch Holland to hit the Russian west flank with the bulk of his division.
Markov's advance guard included the Ekaterinoslav Grenadier Regiment, the Pskov Musketeer Regiment, the 5th, 7th, and 25th Jäger Regiments, six squadrons of the Elisabethgrad Hussar Regiment, four foot artillery batteries, and one horse artillery battery. The Russian forces numbered anywhere from 9,000 to 16,000 men. Until Dupont arrived, Bernadotte had about 9,000 troops available.
Bernadotte deployed Dupont's 7-battalion 1st Division, which comprised the 9th Light, 32nd Line, and 96th Line Infantry Regiments. The 8th Light Infantry Regiment from Rivaud's 2nd Division was present, as was Drouet's 7-battalion 3rd Division, consisting of the 27th Light, 94th Line, and 95th Line Infantry Regiments. General of Division Jean Baptiste Eblé led four foot and two horse artillery batteries, a total of 36 guns. General of Brigade Jacques Louis François Delaistre de Tilly led the corps cavalry, the 2nd and 4th Hussar and 5th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments. Sahuc's attached division included General of Brigade Pierre Margaron's 17th and 27th Dragoon Regiments and Laplanche's 18th and 19th Dragoon Regiments.
Markov sent one infantry regiment forward to the hamlet of Pfarrersfeldchen, with the Elisabethgrad Hussars out front. He placed his main line on some high ground south of Georgenthal (Jurki), with two infantry regiments in the front line and one regiment in a second line. Three battalions of jägers held Georgenthal while two more battalions guarded the west flank.
Bernadotte's cavalry attacked the Russian hussars about 1:00 PM. The hussars drove back their opponents and pursued them, but came upon the French artillery and were driven off. The French horsemen chased the Russians until, they were also stopped by enemy artillery fire. Posting four field pieces on a hill to provide fire support, Bernadotte sent one battalion of the 9th Light Infantry Regiment in a frontal assault on Pfarrersfeldchen, while the 1st battalion of the 27th Light Infantry Regiment attacked a forested area to the east. The 9th was repulsed, so Bernadotte threw in the 2nd battalion of the 27th and the 8th Light Infantry Regiment. The 94th Line Infantry Regiment and the dragoons waited in support. The 1st battalion of the 27th briefy lost its eagle before recapturing it. The attack succeeded in clearing the Russian regiment out of Pfarrersfeldchen.
Markov was forced to deploy six battalions to cover his right flank against Dupont's threatening advance. Meanwhile, Bernadotte attacked in front as it began to get dark. Despite tough fighting, Dupont's flank attack began to made headway and Markov ordered a withdrawal. Around this time, General Anrep arrived and announced that cavalry reinforcements were coming. He was soon hit and carried off, fatally wounded. As they pulled back, the Russians resisted fiercely. Nevertheless, Dupont drove off the two regiments in his front and closed in on Georgenthal.
Suddenly, Bernadotte heard firing in his rear at Mohrungen. He immediately called off the battle and retraced his steps toward the town. What had happened was that Russian cavalry reached the town from the east. Golitsyn, leading the cavalry of the left wing, reached the village of Alt Reichau (Boguchwały), east of Mohrungen. Though he could not hear the battle because of an acoustical quirk, he wanted to scout the territory to the west. From Alt Reichau, he sent three squadrons of cavalry under Count Peter Dolgorukov, followed by six more squadrons under General Pahlen, through the gap between Lake Narie (Narien) and Lake Marąg (Mahrung). The Russian horsemen entered Mohrungen as night fell, capturing the few defenders and pillaging the baggage trains that they found in the town.
Trying to exploit their success, Dolgorukov and Pahlen moved north where they bumped into Bernadotte's returning troops and quickly retreated. Except for a body of cavalry which the French surrounded and captured, the Russian raiders got away with 360 French prisoners, 200 liberated Russian and Prussian prisoners, and some of their loot. Silver plate from petty German states and 12,500 ducats extorted from the town of Elbing (Elbląg) were supposedly found in Bernadotte's personal baggage.
Results.
According to a historian Digby Smith, the French suffered losses of 696 killed and wounded, while 400 were made prisoner. The Russian killed and wounded numbered 1,100, with 300 more being captured. Russian General Anrep lost his life. He was replaced in command of the 14th Division by Lieutenant General Nikolay Kamensky, son of the former commander of the army. Francis Loraine Petre estimates losses as high as 2,000 on each side. Bernadotte reported losing 700 or 800 troops while inflicting 1,600 casualties on his enemies.
The next day, Bernadotte retreated south to Liebemühl (Miłomłyn), leaving Mohrungen to be occupied by Bennigsen's troops. Markov followed up the French toward Liebemühl, while Baggovut's left advance guard seized Allenstein (Olsztyn). At Mohrungen on the 28th, Bennigsen called a halt to operations so that his tired troops could rest. Bernadotte continued withdrawing to the south until he reached Löbau (Lubawa) where he joined General of Division Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul's 2nd Cuirassier Division. This gave him 17,000 infantry and over 5,000 cavalry.
The 4,500-man Prussian garrison of Graudenz (Grudziądz), under General of Infantry Wilhelm René de l'Homme de Courbière, had been besieged by General of Division Marie François Rouyer and a force of Hessians. At L'Estocq's approach, Rouyer raised the siege, allowing the Prussians to restock the garrison's food supplies on 31 January. This timely intervention allowed the garrison to resist the enemy besiegers until the end of the war. A Russian advance guard under General Pyotr Bagration linked L'Estocq and Bennigsen's main force, which was centered on Mohrungen, facing south.
Pleased with his success so far, and expecting Napoleon to retreat to the west bank of the Vistula, Bennigsen was in for a surprise. Far from retreating, the French emperor launched a dangerous counterattack on 1 February. Napoleon saw that Bennigsen had advanced so far west that there was an opportunity to hit the Russian army in the left flank and rear. He ordered Bernadotte to continue retreating to tempt Bennigsen to move westward into the trap. Lannes with the V Corps and General of Division Nicolas Léonard Beker's dragoon division would keep an eye on Ivan Essen's detached force to the northeast of Warsaw. (These forces clashed in the Battle of Ostrołęka on 16 February.) Napoleon ordered the corps of Davout, Soult, Augereau, Murat, and the Imperial Guard northward to Allenstein, while Ney covered the gap between the main body and Bernadotte.
On 1 February, the Russian commander enjoyed a great stroke of good luck. The orders to Bernadotte were given to an officer fresh from the military academy. This hapless individual, ignorant of the area, rode straight into a band of cossacks and was unable to destroy his dispatch. Soon, Bagration came into possession of the important document, which he forwarded to his army commander. As soon as he received the news, Bennigsen ordered the army to rapidly retreat on Jonkowo. As it happened, seven other couriers also fell into the hands of the cossacks, so Bernadotte remained in total ignorance of the plan until 3 February and missed the Battle of Eylau, which occurred on 7 and 8 February. In the meantime, the advancing French and the retreating Prussians and Russians fought a series of clashes at Bergfried (Berkweda) on 3 February, at Waltersdorf (Wilczkowo) on 5 February, and at Hof (Dwórzno) on 6 February.

Wisconsin Idea Theatre

The Wisconsin Idea Theatre was essentially a cultural program, developed at the University of Wisconsin circa. 1943. It was headed by Robert E. Gard within the College of Agriculture, with a mission for developing theatre arts throughout the state. Gard worked with anyone that had an idea, to develop radio dramas, or stage performances. He worked with 4-H, seeking to develop children's theatre within the state, as well as encouraging and assisting faith groups to develop dramas based around their faith.
In 1945, Gard founded the Wisconsin Idea Theatre Conference, which attempted to represent all theatre interests across the state.
History.
The Wisconsin Idea Theatre began when Robert M. La Follette, Sr. and Charles Van Hise attended the University of Wisconsin. They were close friends, both influenced by the progressive ideals of economics professor John Bascom. La Follette went on to become Governor, while Van Hise became President of the University. 
They had a mutual vision of a government "infused with the talent of trained professionals, guided by the expertise of our wisest scholars and answerable to an active and well-educated citizenry." 
In order to realise this ideal, they turned the University towards educating not only its students, but encouraging and teaching residents across the state. Correspondence courses were offered, along with traveling faculty. The Governor held regular meetings with the professors of the University to keep in touch, and to encourage their progress. 
Van Hise's successor, President Glen Frank, had a passion for expanding the arts, and hired Dean Chris Christensen to head the College of Agriculture, hoping to encourage farmers, and their families to be more creative. 
Christensen then hired Aldo Leopold, a well-known conservationist, John Stuart Curry, an artist, and Robert E. Gard. It was Gard that founded the Wisconsin Idea Theatre.

Archelaus of Cilicia

Archelaus (; born before 8 BC; died 38 AD) was a Cappadocian Prince from Anatolia and a Roman client king of Cilicia Trachea and Eastern Lycaonia. He is sometimes called "Archelaus Minor" ("Minor" Latin for "the younger") and "Archelaus II" to distinguish him from his father Archelaus of Cappadocia.
Family background.
Archelaus was a Monarch of Greek, Armenian and Persian descent. He was fifth and final Archelaus to be named after the first Archelaus (his paternal great-great grandfather), who was a General of King Mithridates VI of Pontus. He was the son and heir of the Roman Client King Archelaus of Cappadocia from his first marriage to an unnamed Princess from Armenia and his sister was the Cappadocian Princess Glaphyra. There is a possibility that his parents may have been distantly related. His father is descended from Mithridates VI. His mother may have been a daughter of King Artavasdes II of Armenia (reigned 53 BC-34 BC) of the Artaxiad Dynasty. The father of Artavasdes II was Tigranes the Great, who married Cleopatra of Pontus a daughter of Mithridates VI from his first wife, his sister Laodice, thus Artavasdes II was a maternal grandson to Mithridates VI and Laodice. Archelaus was the maternal uncle of Glaphyra’s children: Tigranes, Alexander and her unnamed daughter.
Life.
Little is known on Archelaus' life prior to becoming king. He was born and raised on the mainland and spent his later life at the harbor city of Elaiussa Sebaste. The Roman Emperor Augustus in 25 BC gave his father extra territories to govern, among them Elaiussa Sebaste. After 25 BC, Archelaus and his family settled there, while his father developed the city, built a royal residence and a palace on the island in the harbor and renamed the city in honor of Augustus.
When Archelaus' father died in 17, Cappadocia became a Roman province and Armenia Minor was given to Artaxias III to be ruled by this as by a Roman client king. The Romans mandated Archelaus to rule, as a client king, Cilicia Trachea including its maritime possessions, Derbe, Laranda and all the surrounding regions up to Eastern Lycaonia, which all were further territories of his father. Archelaus was also allowed to continue his rule over the small Cilician region of Cetis.
Historic sources mention little on Archelaus' life and his reign as king. The main sources are surviving inscriptions from his dominion. In 36, the Cappadocian tribe of the Cietae, who were subjects to Archelaus, resisted against the monarch because of compulsion to supply property returns and taxes in Roman fashion. The tribe withdrew to the heights of the Taurus Mountains aided by the local natural environment, where they held out against Archelaus' unwarlike troops. For Archelaus to end the rebellion, Imperial Governor of Syria Lucius Vitellius the Elder sent four thousand legionaries from the Syrian army, who were commanded by Marcus Trebellius, along with auxiliary troops. When the Roman legionaries arrived to the Taurus Mountains, they constructed earthworks round two hills held by the leaders Cadra and Davara. After the Romans had started to kill some who attempted to break out, Trebellius forced the rest of the tribe to surrender.
Archelaus died in 38, leaving no heir to his throne. Later that year, the monarch Antiochus IV of Commagene was restored to his ancestral dominion as a Roman client king and given Cilicia Trachaea. The Roman Emperor Caligula also gave territories of Archelaus to Antiochus to be ruled by this as a part of his dominion. When Antiochus and his sister-wife Iotapa became Roman client monarchs over their dominions and Iopata bore Antiochus their first child, the couple, as a posthumous honor to Archelaus and as a mark of respect to the former king and their distant relative, named their son Gaius Julius Archelaus Antiochus Epiphanes.

Clubfoot George

George Lane, better known as Clubfoot George, was an alleged outlaw who was hanged on January 13, 1864, in Virginia City, Montana. Lane was later alleged to be a member of a criminal gang known as the Gang of Innocents and sentenced to death. The execution was carried out by the Montana Vigilantes, a committee which functioned during Montana's gold rush in 1863 and 1864.
Early life and journey west.
Lane was born in Massachusetts and suffered from a congenital deformity in his foot. He was a laborer from Massachusetts who traveled to the Western United States to find work. Lane then worked several jobs in California, Idaho, and Montana but was haunted by persistent allegations that he was a horse thief. Sometime between 1848–1855, during the California Gold Rush, Lane moved west. This was then a common practice among adventurous men. While in California he worked at a farm in Yuba County and later as a store clerk in Calaveras County. In 1860 Lane moved to Washington Territory following the path of gold miners. Two years later he was accused of "running off horses" in Idaho and turned himself in to the commander of Fort Lapwai. Lane was sentenced to do construction work. The next year he was accused of stealing horses again, but escaped the town before he was caught. Lane then moved to Virginia City in Montana, another common destination for gold miners.
Virginia City.
Lane came to Virginia City in the fall of 1863, the same year that the Montana Vigilantes Committee was formed. In Virginia City Lane became a boot maker working for Dance and Stuart’s Store. His employers respected him as a hard worker.
In December 1863 a member of the Innocents, George Ives, was subjected to a vigilante trial in Nevada City, Montana. Lane rode to Bannack, Montana in order to inform Bannack sheriff Henry Plummer of the trial. Lane's aim was to convince Plummer that he should request a civilian trial for George Ives. After he learned that Plummer was absent, Lane spoke with two of Plummer's deputies. He complained to them of the common vigilantism in Virginia City. His sentiments were seen as suspicious by the deputies, who soon had Lane arrested. He was told that he was arrested because he was "a road agent, thief, and an accessory to numerous robberies and murders on the highway". He did not resist arrest, but told them that "If you hang me, you will hang an innocent man."
Though some local residents believed that Lane was innocent, the members of the Vigilantes Committee still found him guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging. Shortly before the execution Lane appealed to his employer to confirm his innocence. Dance responded that although Lane was always honest in dealings at work, he had no knowledge of George's other activities. Dance also admitted that the evidence against Lane was rather strong. Lane asked for no more help, but he said, "Well, then, will you pray with me?" Dance agreed: "Willingly, George; most willingly," and, according to biographer Langford, "suiting the action to the word, the judge dropped upon his knees, and, with George and Gallagher kneeling beside him, offered up a fervent petition in behalf of the doomed men."
Lane was then led out of the building to the gallows. He saw a friend of his who came to see the execution and said to him, "Good-bye, old fellow. I'm gone". Lane then took action, and witnesses reported that "without waiting for the box to be removed, he leaped from it, and died with hardly a struggle".
One witness to the execution said that "He was perfectly cool and collected... He evidently thought no more of hanging than the ordinary man would of eating his breakfast."
Sheriff-outlaw Henry Plummer, an alleged member of the same gang, was hanged shortly afterwards.
Burial and exhumation.
Lane was buried in an unmarked grave in Boot Hill cemetery along with other executed men. In 1907 some residents of Virginia City started questioning who was buried in each grave in the cemetery. A former vigilante showed questioners where exactly Lane was buried. The body was exhumed and his petrified clubfoot was found. For some time the clubfoot was kept in the courthouse, but later it was moved to the Thompson Hickman Museum in Virginia City. It has since become one of the Museum's most important exhibits.

Mingun Pahtodawgyi

The Mingun Pahtodawgyi (, ) is an incomplete monument stupa in Mingun, approximately 10 kilometers northwest of Mandalay in Sagaing Region in central Myanmar (formerly Burma). The ruins are the remains of a massive construction project begun by King Bodawpaya in 1790 which was intentionally left unfinished. The pahtodawgyi is seen as the physical manifestations of the well known eccentricities of Bodawpaya. He set up an observation post on an island off Mingun to personally supervise the construction of the temple.
Incompletion.
Bodawpaya used thousands of prisoners of war from his expansionist campaigns and slaves working on the construction of the stupa. The construction was also seen as having a heavy toll over the people and the state, thus a prophesy was allegedly created, to stop the project. The approach in conveying the dissatisfaction was allegedly to utilize the King's deep superstition. The prophesy went "as soon as the building of the pagoda was over, the country would also be gone". 
A variation states that king would die once the project was completed. Thus, construction was slowed down to prevent the prophesy's realisation and when the king died, the project was completely halted.
A model pagoda nearby, typical of many large pagoda projects like the Shwedagon Pagoda and Thatbyinnyu Temple, offers a small scale of what would have been a 150m tall temple.
However, it holds the record of being the largest pile of bricks in the world.
Current Condition.
By the time the construction project was abandoned, the pagoda had attained a height of 50 meters, one third of the intended height.
An earthquake on the 23rd of March 1839 caused huge cracks to appear on the face of the remaining structure. 
The temple serves more as an attraction than a religious site. However, a small shrine with a Buddha image still serves its purpose as a place of worship and meditation. Pondaw paya or a working model of the stupa can be seen nearby.
Mingun Bell.
King Bodawpaya also had a gigantic bell cast to go with his huge stupa. The Mingun Bell, weighing at 90 tons, is today the second largest ringing bell in the world. The weight of the bell in Burmese measurement, is 55,555 viss or "peiktha" (1 viss = 1.63 kg), handed down as a mnemonic "Min Hpyu Hman Hman Pyaw", with the consonants representing the number 5 in Burmese astronomy and numerology.
Accessibility.
Mingun can be reached by a ferry across the Irrawaddy river from Mandalay and then by bullock cart from the river jetty.

Mahmoud Jibril

Mahmoud Jibril el-Warfally (), also transcribed "Jabril" or "Jebril" or "Gebril", (born 28 May 1952) is a Libyan politician who served as the interim Prime Minister of Libya for seven and a half months during the Libyan civil war, chairing the executive board of the National Transitional Council from 5 March to 23 October 2011. He also served as the Head of International Affairs.
, Jibril is the head of one of the largest political parties in Libya, National Forces Alliance.
Toward the end of the conflict, Jibril was increasingly referred to by foreign governments and in media as the interim prime minister of Libya rather than as the chairman of the executive board, the title used to describe him on the NTC's website, but it was unclear whether this was an official title or simply referred to his position as the provisional council's head of government. Jibril's government was recognized as the "sole legitimate representative" of Libya by the majority of UN states including France, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, Iran, and Qatar.
Career.
Jibril graduated in Economics and Political Science from Cairo University in 1975, then earned a master's degree in political science in 1980 and a doctorate in political science in 1985, both from the University of Pittsburgh.
Jibril led the team who drafted and formed the Unified Arab Training manual. He was also responsible for organizing and administering the first two Training conferences in the Arab world in the years 1987 and 1988. He later took over the management and administration of many of the leadership training programs for senior management in Arab countries including Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.
From 2007 to early 2011, he served in the Gaddafi regime as head of the National Planning Council of Libya and of the National Economic Development Board of Libya (NEDB). While there, he was a protégé and close friend of Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and promoted privatization and liberalization policies.
National Transitional Council.
On 23 March 2011, amidst the Libyan civil war, the National Transitional Council officially formed a transitional government and Jibril was appointed to head it. Jibril led meetings and negotiations with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, a meeting that resulted in France officially recognizing the National Transitional Council as the sole representative of the Libyan people. He also met with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and then-U.S. Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz, successfully persuading them to publicly back the NTC.
Since being appointed as the NTC's head of government, Jibril has been referred to by foreign officials as both as the interim prime minister and the chairman of the Executive Board, the title attributed to him by the NTC official website. References to Jibril as the prime minister, including by news organisations, foreign government ministries and world leaders, have increased significantly since rebels entered Tripoli in late August 2011.
In his capacity as the NTC's top diplomat, Jibril has also been referred to as the council's foreign minister, though this may be a colloquial title. Qatar-based news organization Al Jazeera has also called him "the NTC's chief of staff" on at least one occasion.
The Executive Board was sacked "en masse" by decision of the NTC on 8 August over its sluggish response to the assassination of General Abdul Fatah Younis, Benghazi's top commander. Jibril was asked to form a new board subject to the council's approval. Though Jibril stayed on as the board's chairman, a spokesman for the NTC said he would be required to spend less time out of the country.
On 21 August, amidst the Battle of Tripoli, Jibril gave a televised speech urging revolutionary fighters against looting, revenge killing, abusing foreign nationals, and mistreating prisoners of war. He also called for unity and asked that police and army units in Tripoli disavow Gaddafi but remain at their posts. Jibril declared, "Today, all Libya's people are allowed to participate in the building of the future to build institutions with the aid of a constitution that does not differentiate between a man and a woman, sects or ethnicities. Libya is for everyone and will now be for everyone. Libya has the right to create an example that will be followed in the Arab region."
In September, Jibril "proposed 36 names for a new cabinet, including friends and relatives, and retained the prime minister and foreign minister slots for himself." He later retracted the proposal when NTC members objected, but an anonymous council official said it had "left a bitter taste".
Resignation.
On 3 October 2011, Jibril announced that he would resign from government once the country had been "liberated". He later specified this meant the capture of Sirte from loyalist holdouts. On 20 October 2011, Sirte was captured and Muammar Gaddafi was killed. Keeping his promise to leave at the war's end, Jibril resigned three days later. He was succeeded by Abdurrahim El-Keib on 31 October.
In the National Forces Alliance.
In 2012, Jibril became a member of newly founded political union of National Forces Alliance. On 14 March 2012, he was elected leader of the alliance. Jibril represented his party in the General National Congress election.
In the national elections of September 7, 2012, Jibril described his party as a supporter of democracy and also as an advocate of Sharia. The NFA won the largest number of seats in these elections. At the time, Jibril ran for a second term as prime minister. Jibril won the first round of voting, with 86 votes, significantly more than the 55 votes obtained by his primary opponent, Mustafa Abushagur. However in the second round of voting Abushagur ultimately defeated Jibril.

The Mystic Warrior

The Mystic Warrior is 1984 an American TV movie about a band of Sioux and the efforts of one man to save his people from destruction through the use of mysterious powers handed down by ancestors. The movie was originally a nine hour mini-series entitled "Hanta Yo" to be aired in 1980, instead aired in 1984 as a five hour mini series with the new name. The movie was never released on VHS or DVD although it has been shown on cable TV where it failed to draw viewers away from such formidable competition as "The Jeffersons", "Alice" and "One Day at a Time".
Plot.
Set in the years 1802 to 1808, the finished film focused on a young brave named Ahbleza, the son of a Matho chief. Blessed with supernatural visionary powers by the ancient Mahto seer Wanagi, Ahbleza sets about to save his people from the devastations of the future, among them the invasion of the white man. After a lengthy, truth-seeking odyssey fraught with tragedy and sacrifice, Ahbleza assumes his rightful place as spiritual leader of his tribe.
Production.
The five-hour miniseries "The Mystic Warrior" began life in 1979 when producer David L. Wolper announced plans for a ten-hour adaptation of "Hanta Yo", an epic historical novel by Ruth Beebe Hill. Using as her main source a full-blooded Sioux named Chunksa Yuha, Hill fashioned what amounted to a Native American version of "Roots", chronicling the history of the Matho tribe of the Oglala Lakota Sioux. Although Hill was briefly the darling of the literary cognoscenti, her book was ultimately attacked and discredited by a veritable army of Indian historians, teachers, and activists, who accused her of distorting and falsifying truths in order to promote her own (and Yuha's) sociopolitical agenda. Suddenly, all of the Native American support that had been promised to the miniseries version of "Hanta Yo" evaporated. When the project finally aired on May 20 through 21, 1984, its running time (and budget) had been cut in half, and the producer was obliged to qualify the credits by noting that the teleplay was based partially on Hill's book, but mostly on "other sources". Judging by the results, those sources would seem to have been such Hollywood fictional films as "Cheyenne Autumn" and "A Man Called Horse". The filming location had to be changed from New Mexico to Thousand Oaks, California, so as not to offend the Indian tribes in the former state.

2011 NFL lockout

The 2011 National Football League Player lockout was a work stoppage imposed by the owners of the NFL's 32 teams that lasted from March 12, 2011, to July 25, 2011. When the owners and the NFL players, represented by the National Football League Players Association, could not come to a consensus on a new collective bargaining agreement, the owners locked out the players from team facilities and shut down league operations. The major issues disputed were the salary cap, players' safety and health benefits, revenue sharing and television contracts, transparency of financial information, rookie salaries, season length, and free agency guidelines. During the 18 week, 4 day period, there was no free agency and training camp, and players were restricted from seeing team doctors, entering or working out at team facilities, or communicating with coaches. The end of the lockout coincided with the formation of a new collective bargaining agreement prior to the start of the 2011 regular season.
Background.
In 1993, the National Football League (NFL) and the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) came to terms on a collective bargaining agreement. This agreement was renewed four times. In May 2008, the owners decided to opt out of the 1993 arrangement and play the 2010 season without a salary cap due to the 2010 season being the last year of the CBA. That last labor agreement gave players 57 percent of the league’s $8 billion in revenue, after the owners took more than $1 billion for operating and development costs of the league. A major reason the owners opted out of the CBA early was that they wanted a larger percentage of league revenue. Part of the previous CBA involved a transfer of revenues from the higher earning teams to the lowest, even though some of the higher earners also had higher costs. The players, represented as the National Football League Players Association, were very skeptical that the owners were losing money as a result of their payments to players, and believed the labor dispute was deliberately generated by some owners in order to renegotiate their own revenue sharing agreements which are attached to the CBA. The players resisted any pay cuts across the board.
The major changes the owners wanted implemented in the next agreement were to significantly reduce the players' percentage of revenue, to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games, and establish a rookie wage scale and/or rookie salary cap that would limit first-round draft pick compensation. The players wanted guaranteed a higher percentage of league wide spending and cash spend by every team per the salary cap on players, more benefits for former players, and changes made to improve health and safety including offseason and in-season training.
Anticipating an owner-imposed lockout, players on every team voted unanimously in Fall 2010 to agree to renounce collective bargaining rights if a CBA extension could not be reached prior to expiration of the current CBA. Renunciation of CBA rights would expose the owners to potential antitrust lawsuits. The players would then lose the ability to collectively bargain with the owners. The league is exempt from most facets of antitrust laws as a result of Public Law 89-800, passed in the wake of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, thus complicating any potential lawsuit against the league. The NFL hired firms to lobby members of the U.S. Congress on their behalf, and the NFL's political action committee, "Gridiron PAC," made several large donations to lawmakers who oversee the league in numerous capacities, as well as several other influential lawmakers. The players union also hired firms to lobby members of the U.S. Congress on their behalf, claiming that a lockout could potentially cost each NFL city $160 million in lost business. Congressmen also indicated a willingness to intervene if necessary.
The NFL had negotiated contracts with TV networks to provide over $4 billion in 2011 to the NFL even if the owners shut down the league and no games were played in 2011. On March 1, 2011 Judge David S. Doty ruled that the NFL had been actively strategizing for a lockout of the players for more than two years. It was determined that the purpose of the NFL's deliberate actions were to "advance its own interests and harm the interests of the players."
Lockout.
Renunciation of CBA rights.
Following the end of 2010 season, the players and owners had not resolved the labor dispute. Although the CBA was set to expire on March 3, the players and the league owners agreed to extend the negotiations by one week, changing the expiration date to March 11, 2011. After a one week extension, negotiations failed to result in a new agreement. At midnight on March 11, the CBA expired and the owners imposed a lockout. Accordingly, the NFLPA informed the league and the clubs that the players had voted to have the NFLPA renounce its bargaining rights. After the renunciation of collective bargaining rights, quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees joined seven other NFL players and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout.
Court rulings.
On April 25, 2011, U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson invalidated the lockout and ordered the league to resume operations. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while it appeals to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. The NFLPA had advised players to arrive at their teams' stadiums for work uninvited; most teams allowed players to enter the front office but refused further access. The order to resume operations without any CBA in place left the league in "chaos" because, without a CBA, there were no rules in place regarding a salary cap or floor, free agency, and similar labor-related issues. On April 29, 2011, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the lockout following Day 2 of the draft. The stay was extended through at least June 3, when a full appeal was heard; the Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of the lockout, but also suggested that Judge Nelson could impose an injunction of the lockout as it relates to players not under contract such as free agents and rookies.
Contingency plans.
A provision in the CBA ensured that the 2011 NFL Draft was allowed to take place despite the lockout. In addition, there was also some cushion in the 2011 schedule just in case the labor dispute lasted into September and the planned start of the regular season. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that Super Bowl XLVI could be moved a week later if needed, so that the entire season could be played in full. In addition, every contest in Week 3 had teams that shared the same bye week later in the season, which would have allowed these games to be made up on what was originally the teams' byes. Weeks 2 and 4 were set up so that there are neither any divisional rivalry games nor teams on bye in those weeks, which would have kept the season as fair as possible if those games had to be canceled. The league could also eliminate the normal off week between the conference championship games and the Super Bowl. Up to six weeks of the season could have been lost (moving week 3 games into the bye weeks, canceling weeks 2, 4, and 17, and moving weeks 1 and 5 to the end of the season while postponing the playoffs one week) while still keeping a generally fair schedule with five division games and eight non-division games. The league also had a plan for a longer lockout, which included an abbreviated eight-game season beginning in late November. Goodell had also stated that the league did not consider using replacement players.
Other litigation.
On March 28, 2011, four former NFL players, including Hall of Fame defensive end Carl Eller, sued the NFL in hopes of joining current players in their antitrust fight against the league. The 44-page complaint filed in federal court in Minneapolis sought class-action status on behalf of all former players. The retirees wanted the NFL lockout lifted to ensure their pensions and health benefits remain funded. According to the lawsuit, those benefits would end if a collective bargaining agreement was not renewed by next March 11, a year after the last one expired.
On July 5, 2011, a group of retired NFL players led by Carl Eller, Franco Harris, Marcus Allen and Paul Krause filed its own class-action lawsuit against both the NFL and NFLPA, stating that the renunciation of CBA rights disqualified the NFLPA from bargaining on the former NFL players' behalf.
End of lockout.
The NFL owners announced on July 21, 2011 that they had approved a settlement of the players' antitrust litigation by a 31–0–1 margin (the Oakland Raiders abstained), but the players decided not to vote on the settlement because they did not approve all of the terms outlined in the proposal. After continued negotiations, the ten players named as plaintiffs in the Brady case approved the settlement on July 25, and the agreement became effective after ratification by a majority of the players in the NFL on August 4, 2011. Although the settlement was approved on July 25, the NFL didn't officially recognize the NFLPA’s status as the players’ collective bargaining representative until July 30, 2011. When NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and NFLPA Executive Director DeMaurice Smith signed the agreement, the lockout officially ended.
New CBA.
ESPN writer John Clayton notes that there are five major parts of the new CBA: free agency, salary cap, rookie compensation, minimum salaries, and franchise tags. First, free agency guidelines returned to the way they were from 1993 to 2009. This means that a player needs four years of experience to become an unrestricted free agent, and three years of experience for restricted free agency. Second, the salary cap is now $120.375 million, but unlike the previous CBA, the new one initially has no per-team salary minimum. Team salary floors will not return until the 2013 season, at which time they will be 89% of the cap. For the 2011 season, teams had the ability to "borrow" $3 million in future salary cap space to use on a signed player. For the years following the 2011 season, teams have the option of "borrowing" $1.5 million each for up to three players. Third, the rookie compensation was altered. There is a limit to the amount of money given to rookies, with the maximum total in 2011 being $874 million. First round picks receive four-year deals, with a fifth year option. In the second through seventh rounds, there are slotted four-year deals. Fourth, the league minimum salary for players increased by 10–12 percent, based on tenure. Fifth, a team's ability to place a franchise or transition tag on top players to retain his rights did not change. Other major concerns included health and safety of players, as well as former player benefits and pensions. The new 10-year collective bargaining agreement runs through 2021, and has an estimated value of $12–$16 billion per year.
Players' takeaways.
The players won $1 billion in additional benefits for retired players, an opportunity to stay in the players' medical plan for life, increased minimum salaries, the continuation of a 16-game regular season schedule, improvements in player safety, increased injury protection, unrestricted free agency after four years, a true salary floor, and increased roster size. Some of the major player safety improvements included five fewer weeks of organized off-season practice, limited on-field practice time, limited full-contact practices, elimination of two-a-day practices in pads, and an increase in the number of days off of work. The players also prevented the owners from knocking them down to 42 percent of league revenues, with a decreasing percentage each year. Starting in 2012, the players also won 55 percent of national media revenue, 45 percent of all NFL Ventures revenue, and 40 percent of local club revenue.
Owners' takeaways.
The owners won franchise and transition tags, not having to pay $320 million in benefits for an uncapped year, no judicial oversight in disputes between players and owners, settlement of all pending litigation, a rookie wage system, full regular season game revenue, more equitable revenue sharing and supplemental revenue sharing, no opt out clause for players for 10 years (though the owners cannot opt out, either), and credit for stadium investments with up to 1.5 percent of revenue each year. The league also cited the new CBA as a key factor in being able to negotiate long-term extensions in their television contracts, which were renewed a few months after the CBA was finalized and include minimum 50% increases in rights fees across all television partners.
The owners were unable to get an additional $1 billion off the top of all revenue, an 18-game season, and rights of first refusal for the 2011 unrestricted free agents.
Hall of Fame Game.
The two teams (Chicago Bears and St. Louis Rams) involved in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game had set a deadline of July 22, 2011, for both sides to ratify a deal in time for training camp to be opened and the game to be played (under normal circumstances, each team opens training camp 15 days before their first preseason game). When that day passed without both sides agreeing to a deal, the league canceled the game. The Pro Football Hall of Fame Game was the only on-field cancellation of the lockout.

Stanger Manor Secondary School

Stanger Manor Secondary School is a public high school located in Stanger / KwaDukuza on the north coast of South Africa.
Academic history.
The portals of Stanger Manor Secondary were opened to its first set of pupils on 21 July 1980. The first batch of matriculants sat for the Senior Certificate Examination in December 1983. The percentage pass was 82%. The percentage pass rate progressively improved to 97.5% in 1987. The number of distinctions also increased over the years and in 1987 Basil Dhaniram came twelfth in the top twenty amongst all the candidates in South Africa. Raveen Parbhoosing obtained the highest marks from amongst the candidates in the House of Delegates Science Olympiad and winning a sponsored trip to London to attend the Science Conference. In 1988 Camantha Reddy obtained the highest marks in the home Economics Olympiad, and ever since the school has been producing among the top candidates.
During the 1990s, the school celebrated 10 years since it first opened; the occasion was marked by having a celebration day at school. In these 10 years other than academic excellence the school has also produced some fine athletes with many of the learners over the years being selected to represent Natal and South Africa in their respective categories. The physical facilities at the school have undergone many upgrades over the years, including a double tennis court, a double cricket net, a Basketball/Volleyball court and a swimming pool which are the most notable improvements.

During the Worldcup in Baselga, Voorhuis was the only Dutch competitor and came in 4th on the 1500 meters.
At the World Cup final in Thialf (Heerenveen), she qualified for the World Championships long distances 2008 in Nagano. She came in 11th at the 1500 meters there.
Season 2008/09.
Voorhuis was 6th at the Dutch championships long distances 2009 on the 3000 meters, which wasn't enough to qualify for the World Cups. But right before the first Worldcup match in Berlin, Lisette van der Geest broke her collarbone, which caused Jorien Voorhuis to take her place. In the mean time she rose to the 35th place in the Adelskalendern.
In the Dutch championships allround 2009 she was 4th at the final placing after disqualification of Renate Groenewold. But because Groenewold had a ticket for the European championships, Voorhuis was selected as a reserve for this championship. At January 21, 2009 Voorhuis qualified for the World Championships allround 2009 in Hamar, by a skate-off, along with her teammate Tom Prinsen. She was the 2nd Dutch skater in a 5th place.

Season 2010/11.

But she didn't qualify for the World Cup 2010/2011 because of the protection over Margot Boer. At the 5000 meters it looked like she was going to win, but she was disqualified for crossing the line at the straight side. The KNSB selected her for the World Cup anyway. She also got to skate the 3000 meters, because Marrit Leenstra canceled.

Luke Fickell

Luke Fickell (born August 18, 1973) is an American football coach and former player. Fickell is currently the co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach for the Ohio State Buckeyes. An assistant at Ohio State for over ten seasons, Fickell served as the team's head coach during the 2011 football season.
Playing career.
Fickell spent his entire playing career in Columbus, Ohio, graduating from DeSales High School in 1992. After redshirting for the Buckeyes in 1992, Fickell went on to be a standout member of the defensive unit, making a school-record 50 consecutive starts at the nose guard position from 1993–1996, four bowl games. In his freshman year, he lined up next to Dan Wilkinson. Despite having a torn pectoral muscle, Fickell started the 1997 Rose Bowl, making two tackles in the Buckeyes victory over Arizona State. After graduating from Ohio State in 1997, Fickell signed as an undrafted free agent with the New Orleans Saints. After tearing the ACL in his knee, he spent the remainder of the season on the injured reserve list and was later released by the team.
Coaching career.
After his brief stint in the NFL, Fickell fulfilled a childhood dream by joining the Ohio State Buckeyes coaching staff after being accepted as a graduate assistant with the Buckeyes in 1999 under his former coach, John Cooper. In 2000, Fickell was hired by the University of Akron as the defensive line coach. After two seasons with the Zips, he returned to Ohio State once again in 2002, this time as the special teams coordinator under second-year head coach, Jim Tressel. In 2004, Fickell took over as the linebackers coach, adding the title co-defensive coordinator to his responsibilities in 2005. In 2010, He was named "Assistant Coach of the Year" by the AFCA, joining a list of Buckeyes coaches to be recognized by the association that also includes Carroll Widdoes, Woody Hayes, Earle Bruce and Jim Tressel.
Fickell was initially promoted to the position of assistant head coach and was to serve as the interim head coach during Jim Tressel's five game suspension to open the 2011 season. However, on May 30, 2011, Tressel resigned amid an NCAA investigation and Fickell was appointed to the position of head coach. On November 28, Fickell's stint as head coach ended with the hiring of Urban Meyer. He coached the Buckeyes one last time in the 2012 Gator Bowl against Meyer's old team, the Florida Gators. Although only achieving a 6-7 record, many analysts praised Fickell's leadership and handling of players during the 2011 season. On January 15, 2012, Luke Fickell was introduced as Urban Meyer's co-defensive coordinator.

Dubautia waialealae

Dubautia waialealae is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common name Wai'ale'ale dubautia. Like other "Dubautia" this plant is called na`ena`e.
Distribution.
The "Dubautia waialealae" plant is endemic to Hawaii, where it is known only from Mount Waiʻaleʻale on Kauai. One individual was seen outside the range, about 14 kilometers away, but this plant is now dead. A recent count estimates a total population of about 3000 plants. 
The plant grows in boggy wet forest habitat on the mountain summit that is considered one of the rainiest spots on earth, if not the rainiest. It grows in habitat around the famous Mount Waiʻaleʻale rain gauge, which measures 460 inches (38.3 feet) of rain in an average year, its distribution extending a short way down the slopes of the mountain.
Description.
"Dubautia waialealae", a distinctive member of the silversword alliance, takes the form of a dense, rounded, cushionlike clump 10 to 50 centimeters tall. The leaves are borne in tightly packed whorls. Yellow flowers are borne in heads. Blooming occurs in August through November.
Conservation.
Threats to this rare localized endemic plant include damage to the habitat by feral pigs, feral goats, and invasive plant species such as "Juncus planifolius" and "Andropogon virginicus". It was federally listed as an endangered species of the United States in 2010.

William Perigo

William J. "Bill" Perigo (September 17, 1911 – February 7, 1990) was an American basketball player and coach. He played college basketball for Western Michigan University from 1931 to 1934 and professional basketball for the Indianapolis Kautskys from 1934 to 1936. Perigo also worked as a basketball coach for more than 25 years. He was the basketball coach at Benton Harbor High School for 13 years and led the team to the Michigan Class A state championship in 1941. He was the head basketball coach at Western Michigan University (1949–1952) and the University of Michigan (1952–1960). In 1983, he was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame.
Early years and college basketball.
Perigo was born in Lebanon, Indiana in 1911. His father, Alonzo Lon Perigo, was a farmer in Boone County, Indiana. Perigo graduated from Delphi High School in Indiana in 1930. He twice helped lead Delphi to the Indiana state finals and was "considered the greatest jumping center of his era." He enrolled at Western Michigan University and graduated in 1934. He played three years of varsity basketball at Western Michigan, during which time Western Michigan compiled a 40–13 record.
Professional basketball.
In the 1930s, Perigo played professional basketball for the Indianapolis Kautskys. During the 1934–35 season, the Kautskys, featuring Perigo and John Wooden, had a 15-game winning streak.
Coaching career.
Perigo was a basketball coach for more than 25 years at the high school and collegiate levels. He coached high school basketball in Markleville, Indiana (two years) and Benton Harbor, Michigan (13 years) before moving to the collegiate level. His Benton Harbor teams won 13 Southwest Conference titles and the Michigan Class A basketball championship in 1941. 
Perigo became a friend of John Wooden when the two played professional basketball together for the Kautskys. When Perigo coached high school basketball at Benton Harbor, Wooden lived a short distance away in South Bend, Indiana. During those years, Wooden and his wife often drove to Benton Harbor for Sunday dinners with the Perigos. Wooden also visited practice sessions and offered coaching tips to Perigo.
Perigo was the head basketball coach at Western Michigan University (1949–1952) and the University of Michigan (1952–1960). He compiled a 41–27 (.603) in three years at Western Michigan. In July 1952, he was hired by the University of Michigan as its head basketball coach. In eight years as the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team, Perigo compiled a 78–100 (.438) record. His record in Big Ten Conference games while at Michigan was 38–78. Perigo's best season at Michigan came with the 1958–59 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team, captained by M. C. Burton, Jr., and compiling a 15–7 (.682) record. Perrigo resigned as Michigan's head basketball coach in May 1960 after the 1959–60 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team finished with a 1-13 record against Big Ten Conference opponents. Perigo told the press at the time that he planned to obtain a master's degree and pursue a career in teaching or athletic administration.
Later years and death.
Perigo remained in Ann Arbor after resigning his coaching position, and worked as an administrator until he retired in 1970. He was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1983. Perigo died in Ann Arbor in 1990 at age 78.

Logos Panic

The characters were designed by Kotobuki Shiriagari.
Summary.
The game starts with an animated/cinematic intro sequence. A Japanese man and woman portrayed in the distinct business man/woman ("Kaisha-in 事務員") satire comedy Kotobuki Shiriagari "Heta-Uma へたうま" style, turn up at work but they can't understand the greetings their co-workers are saying. Suddenly a silver-haired devil turns up mumbling something. The man and woman say: "He just said "しつれいします", didn't he?", prompting the start screen to launch. Logos Panic pits players to scramble Japanese Kanji in a sort of Tetris puzzle style scenario; kanji must be correctly put together in time, simultaneously as new kanji pop out at the bottom of the screen. The game ends when the player can't assemble appropriate sentences in time. At the beginning there are only eight selectable characters but as the game progresses, another three will eventually appear. It uses a password system to allow players to pick up and play at their leisure.
"Logos Panic" is about garbled versions of greeting words. Goaisatu "ごあいさつ" or greetings are the words used in the game being 'garbled' and pretty random, not just greetings. They are puzzled over the greetings "aisatsu します". The two players have to create words that appear in red, yellow and blue at the sides of the screen, aspects to consider are players and the blue line to pay attention to, in order to correctly put the katakanas in their correct grammatical place.

Wapiti River (New Zealand)

The Wapiti River is a river in the Southland Region of New Zealand. It rises in the northern extremity of the Stuart Mountains in Fiordland National Park, the top of its watershed being part of the main divide. Two branches feed Lake Sutherland, (elevation ) the outflow of which flows southwest to Lake Thomson. A further reach of the river heads east to Lake Hankinson, which is separated from the North West Arm of the Middle Fiord of Lake Te Anau by a final stretch of the river.
The river is named for the Wapiti (Cervus canadensis), an introduced deer species found in Fiordland. Lake Wapiti lies a few kilometres from the Wapiti River, but is in a separate catchment, that of the Doon River feeding the West Arm of the Middle Fiord.
A tramping track connecting Lake Te Anau to George Sound via the Henry Pass follows the Wapiti River from its mouth as far as the head of Lake Thomson, thereafter turning west up a tributary named Rugged Burn.

SALT Beyoğlu opened April 9, 2011. The original building of SALT Beyoğlu was constructed between 1850 and 1860. Opening on Istanbul’s pedestrian street Istiklal Caddesi with the name Siniossoglou Apartment, the building initially functioned as retail space on street level, with domestic residences on its upper floors. When, in the 1950s, the Beyoğlu district’s population fell into decline, the building ceased to function residentially, its space instead used for retail, political and artistic activities. Redesign of the building for contemporary use combines conservation of Siniossoglou Apartment’s original architectural elements, reinforcement of its structure, and a reorganization of the internal layout. SALT Beyoğlu hosts 1,130 square meters of exhibition space on three levels, as well as the Forum, Walk-in-Cinema, Shop and Garden.
SALT Galata opened November 22, 2011. Originally designed by Alexander Vallaury as the 19th century Imperial Ottoman Bank headquarters, SALT Galata is organized to enable a challenging, multi-layered program that includes SALT Research, offering public access to thousands of print and digital resources; spaces dedicated to research; workshops; an exhibition and conference hall; as well as the Ottoman Bank Museum.
As a physical entity SALT Ulus does not compete in terms of scale and prestige with SALT’s venues in Istanbul. The building in question is the annex of the former Ottoman Bank on Atatürk Bulvarı across one of the Republic’s main landscape projects Gençlik Parkı in Ankara. Used today as Garanti Bank, the main building was designed by Guilo Mongeri and was constructed in 1926. The annex housing SALT Ulus was a later addition, also commissioned to Mongeri, to provide lodging for traveling bank inspectors. Unused since 2002, this building was repurposed after the establishment of SALT, and opened as SALT Ulus on April 3, 2013. SALT Ulus is a site for exhibitions and programs, and hosts young researchers for extended periods in two research residency offices.
SALT Research.
Comprising an extensive library that focuses on the arts, architecture, design, urbanism, and social and economic history, as well as an archive of physical and digital documents, SALT Research is the hub of SALT Galata and fills the building's 650 square meter central atrium. The floor and mezzanine of the atrium previously served as the bank branch and still house the entrances to the original bank safes.
Designed by ŞANAL Architecture Planning, the library’s facilities have been developed to be user-centered; to meet Library 2.0 standards; and to reflect SALT’s desire to encourage research, learning and debate. Taking Alexander Vallaury’s fusion of diverse architectural styles as a starting point, ŞANAL designed the different elements of SALT Research to respond to the history of modern design in Istanbul. Users of SALT Research may conduct online catalogue searches of the archive and library, watch art videos and other moving image material, and study archival documents on large digital screens.
SALT E-publishing.
SALT’s e-books can be read in PDF and e-publication formats; they are downloadable to tablets and readers and printable. This easily accessible e-platform is available universally and, along with all of SALT’s activities, is free of charge. The first version of SALT’s e-publishing platform also provides a unique new service - readers are able to select chapters they would like to read from different e-books and construct a personalized book. After determining the title, cover, and selected contents, the customized book will be ready for download in a few minutes and sent to their e-mail address.
SALT Research Funds.
SALT Research Funds were initiated in 2013 to further SALT’s dedication to experimental thought, research, social change and the multi-dimensional and critical evaluation of these concerns. In the first year, SALT awarded SALT Research Funds to six research projects engaged in issues of the built environment, questions of modernism, politics of memory and overlooked histories.

Darkest Mercy

Darkest Mercy is an Urban fantasy novel by Melissa Marr. It is set in the same universe as Marr's previous YA novels, but is not a sequel to Radiant Shadows; rather, it is a companion novel like Ink Exchange was, focusing on a different set of characters.
Plot.
Keenan must choose between his queen Aislinn and his beloved Donia, while Aislinn is in love with Seth. However when the warmongering villain Bananach attacks they must unite, until at the end the love quadrilateral is resolved.
Prologue.
Darkest Mercy commences with a usual deep and dark gloom as seen in a few of its series. The last book of the Wicked Lovely series, begins with chaos. The courts are in disorder, people are missing, the regents in all the faery courts are all relatively new at their jobs. Most of the characters from the previous books in the series are back and we see all their stories tie together in the end as they fight the faery called War and struggle to find the necessary balance between the courts. Also when Devlin and Ani are in parral they then realize how much they love each other and truly need each other! It's a truly fascinating tale of love, compassion, and war.
Critical response.
Kirkus found it hard work, "for fans only". However RT Book Reviews was much more positive, seeing it as an excellent if shocking conclusion to the series.
