Caergwrle (horse)

Caergwrle (foaled 1965) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career lasting from July 1967 until June 1968, the filly ran six times and won three races. After winning once as a two-year-old she showed improved form in the spring of 1968 to win the Classic 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse. Caergwrle was beaten in her only subsequent race and was retired to stud where she had limited success as a broodmare.
Background.
Caergwrle was a chestnut filly bred at the Cliff Stud in Yorkshire by Gwen Murless, the wife of the leading British trainer Noel Murless. Her sire Crepello won the 1957 Epsom Derby before becoming a successful sire of winners. Caergwrle's dam, Caerphilly, was a sprinter who won three races and finished third in the 1962 edition of the five furlong King George Stakes. Apart from Caerwrle, Caerphilly also produced St Chad, a colt who won the Wills Mile in 1967. As descendants of the broodmare Malapert, Caerphilly and Caergwrle were closely related to the 2000 Guineas winner Pall Mall.
Caerwrle, who was named after a Welsh village, was trained by Noel Murless at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket, Suffolk.
Racing career.
Caergwrle made her first racecourse appearance in the Star Stakes over five furlongs at Sandown Park in May. She ran promisingly to finish second to Fairy Path. In July Caergwrle started 2/5 favourite for the Findon Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. She was regarded as a near certainty to win and was the subject of heavy betting on The Tote but lost her chance when she bolted before the race and galloped several furlongs at top speed before being caught. She eventually finished well beaten behind Fridoline. In September she recorded her first win when she won a five furlong maiden race at Chester.
On her three-year-old debut, Caergwrle showed vastly improved form when she won the seven furlong 1000 Guineas Trial Stakes at Kempton Park by four lengths. In the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile, Caergwrle was made 4/1 favourite in a field of fourteen fillies. Ridden by the nineteen-year-old Sandy Barclay, she won by a length from Photo Flash, with Sovereign a neck away in third. A month later, Caerwrle was sent to Epsom for the Ebbisham Stakes over eight and a half furlongs. She was beaten a length by Ileana, who was carrying four pounds less. Caergwrle never ran again and was retired to stud.
Retirement.
Caergwrle remained in the Murless family's ownership throughout her breeding career. She produced several winners, but none at a high level. Her most successful offspring, foaled when she was twenty-one years old, was St Ninian who won seven races, including the Jubilee Handicap at Kempton Park. The descendants of Caerwrle's daughter Cricceith had some success in New Zealand, the most notable being Batavian, who won the Great Northern Foal Stakes and the Hawke's Bay Guineas.

Come on a Cone (song)

"Come on a Cone" is a song by American recording artist Nicki Minaj, taken from her sophomore studio album, "" (2012). It was written by Minaj, Winston Thomas, Larry Nacht, and Safaree Samuels, and was produced by Hit-Boy. Musically, it is a hardcore hip hop song that uses electronic beats. Lyrically, the song is rumored to be another diss song to Lil' Kim, following "Roman's Revenge" and "Stupid Hoe". "Come on a Cone" received mainly positive reviews from contemporary critics, while others criticized the chorus, calling it the main problem of the song.
Background.
"Come on a Cone" was written and produced by Chauncey Hollis under his production name, Hit-Boy, with Minaj contributing additional songwriting. Despite not discussing a particular musical style that the pair wanted to peruse beforehand, Hollis had made both "Come on a Cone" and "I Am Your Leader" to suit the album's "bipolar" sound, and sent them in as the first two songs: "I kind of did these records just blindly sent her some beats. It was out of the first batch of beats that I sent." Initially, Minaj rejected the song because it was conceived with a space-age sound, but later Hollis explained that she had suggested changing the tempo, "The tempo was a bit slower so she was like, 'Can you speed this up?' I sped it up, and she hit me back like, 'Yo, this is crazy, I'm writing to it,' and [she just kept having me send beats." Although Hollis was not present during the recording of "Come on a Cone", he was impressed with the final product, saying, "I just went in blindly, I just sent beats, which is like the stars aligning. She picked the right joints and blacked out on them." The song was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, California and Jungle City Studios in New York City, New York by Ariel Chobaz, who received assistance from Jon Sher, who also assisted Chobaz in mixing "Come on a Cone" at Conway Studios.
Composition.
"Come on a Cone" is a hardcore hip hop and electro-hop song that has a length of three minutes and five seconds. It contains a simple, bass-heavy beat, and features percussive "synth-stabs", which according to Marc Hogan of "Spin", showcases "Nicki's phenomenal rapping ability".
The song features Minaj as Roman Zolanski and is rumored to be another diss song to Lil' Kim, following "Stupid Hoe". Minaj makes references to Ellen DeGeneres ("When you see me on "Ellen" / Just admit that I'm winning"), Oscar de la Renta ("Front row with Oscar / De la Renta posture"), Anna Wintour ("When I'm sitting with Anna / I'm really sitting with Anna / Ain't no metaphor punchline / I'm really sitting with Anna"), Versace ("Do a show for Versace / They request me by name / And if they don't get Nicki / It just won't be the same"), and Cee Lo Green ("7 Up went and gave my commercial to Cee Lo...") In the chorus, Nicki as Roman repeats the title in a cartoonish voice, which was compared to "Stupid Hoe".
Critical reception.
Jayson Greene of "Pitchfork" selected the song as a "best new track", and said: "Her performance on this song is something else entirely: demented. Chaotic. Gloriously unpredictable. Fearless. One of the most creatively unhinged vocal takes in pop-rap history -- or at least an immediate contender for the top ten. Whatever cheap hyperbole you could fling at this performance, Nicki bats down with one of her palmetto-sized eyelashes". Emily Mackay of "NME" praised the song's composition for being engaging, but found it's lyrical content hard to listen to. In her review of "Come on a Cone", Emily Exton of PopDust had a mixed response, praising it's "convincing" delivery and "monstrous" beat and compared the song to Minaj's best guest work, but ended the review by saying: "Things begin "normal" enough, but Roman's full control over the chorus makes what could be a smooth banger an unstable head-scratcher, where it's difficult to keep track of Nicki versus Roman's intentions." 
Henry Yanney of SoulCulture called the song's production "bizarre" and "mind numbing", but said Minaj "still conjures up some verses to again ensure listeners of her rap allegiance." Writing for "Slant", Matthew Cole praised "Come on a Cone" as being "brilliant", and called it "one of the most hilarious and genuinely unexpected moments I've heard from a rapper" since Missy Elliott. Joe Rivers of "No Ripcord" noted the song to be among the least commercial on the album, saying: "Here, beats are sparse, and frills and instrumentation are minimal. It’s all geared up to make Minaj’s rhymes the focal point, and it gives the record something of a mixtape feel." Chris Willman of The Wrap said "Come on a Cone" delivered the album's best moments, saying it's "probably the only track that's slightly less salacious than it sounds."
Promotion.
Music video.
Although not being released as a single, a music video for the song was released on October 22, 2012, as a teaser to the re-release of "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded". It was directed by Grizzlee Music and released through his YouTube channel. It resembles the theme from Minaj's previous single from her debut album, "Pink Friday", "Did It On'em". The video features footage from Minaj's concerts and the 2012 BET Awards, also Tyga, Blac Chyna, Gucci Mane, Birdman, Waka Flocka Flame, Safaree "SB" Samuels, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and "American Idol" judge Randy Jackson appear in the clip.
Live performances.
Minaj has performed "Come on a Cone" on the European and North American legs of her debut concert tour, the Pink Friday Tour. The song has also served as the opening number to Minaj's second concert tour, the .

<doc id="36626737" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36626737" title="LGBT employment discrimination in the United States">
LGBT employment discrimination in the United States

The regulation of LGBT employment discrimination in the United States varies by jurisdiction. Many, but far from all, states and localities prohibit bias in hiring, promotion, job assignment, termination, and compensation, as well as harassment on the basis of one's sexual orientation. Fewer extend those protections to cover sexual identity. Some cover government employees but do not extend their protections to the private sector. Protections at the national level are limited. There is no federal statute addressing employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Federal employees.
Presidents have established certain protections for some employees of the federal government by executive order. In 1995, President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12968 establishing criteria for the issuance of security clearances included sexual orientation for the first time in its non-discrimination language: "The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information." It also said that "no inference" about suitability for access to classified information "may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee." Clinton's Executive Order 13087 in 1998 prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in the competitive service of the federal civilian workforce. It applied to employees of the government of the District of Columbia and the United States Postal Service and to civilian employees of the armed forces, but not to certain excepted services, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Clinton acknowledged its limitations in a statement:
At the start of 2010, the Obama administration included gender identity among the classes protected against discrimination under the authority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). On July 1, 2011, the EEOC ruled that job discrimination against lesbians, gays and bisexuals constituted a form of sex-stereotyping and thus violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On April 20, 2012, the EEOC went further and ruled that gender identity was also a protected class under the ban on sex discrimination found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
On March 31, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly ruled in the case of "TerVeer v. Billington", that Peter TerVeer can sue for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, that bans sex discrimination, claiming that he faced discrimination after his boss found out that he was gay. Title VII does not explicitly protect against sexual orientation discrimination, but Judge Kollar-Kotelly's ruling leaves that a person could bring a claim under Title VII’s ban on sex discrimination because an employer views an employee’s sexual orientation as “not consistent with acceptable gender roles.”
A bill to ban employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), has been introduced repeatedly in the U.S. Congress since 1994.
State law.
Pennsylvania became the first state to ban public sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1975. Wisconsin became the first state to ban both public and private sector employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1982. Minnesota became the first state to ban employment discrimination based on both sexual orientation and gender identity when it passed the Human Rights Act in 1993. Twenty-one states, the District of Columbia, and over 140 cities and counties have enacted bans of one sort or another.
Eighteen states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have statutes that protect against both "sexual orientation and gender identity" discrimination in employment in the public and private sector: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.
Six states have an executive order, administrative order, or personnel regulation prohibiting discrimination in public employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity only: Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. One state prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public employment only: New York. Ohio previously included gender identity, until Governor John Kasich allowed the executive order covering it to expire in January 2011.
The states that ban "sexual orientation" discrimination in employment by statute are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Many of these laws also ban discrimination in other contexts, such as housing or public accommodation.
Five states have executive orders prohibiting discrimination in "public employment" based on "sexual orientation" only: Alaska, Arizona, Missouri, Montana, and Ohio. Louisiana previously included sexual orientation, until Governor Bobby Jindal allowed the executive order covering it to expire in August 2008.
Seventeen other states have laws that have been interpreted to protect transgender persons.

Private sector policies.
Many large companies provide equal rights and benefits to their lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender employees, as measured by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) through its Corporate Equality Index. The 2011 report found that 337 large companies received a 100% rating. These businesses employ a total of over 8.3 million full-time U.S. workers. When the Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index was first used in 2002, 13 companies were rated 100 percent. Each year, corporations send thousands of employees to the Out & Equal Regional Summit, a conference that aims to create a more inclusive work environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. There are workplace resources for how allies can create a more inclusive work environment, including programs available through PFLAG.
Widespread adoption of private workplace policies may be motivated by good business sense, the Williams Institute suggests. Its conclusion is based on a set of studies that show that lesbians and gay men who have come out at work report lower levels of anxiety, less conflict between work and personal life, greater job satisfaction, more sharing of employers' goals, higher levels of satisfaction with their co-workers, more self-esteem, and better physical health.

Willem van Ravesteyn (Rotterdam, 15 October 1876 – Rotterdam, 10 June 1970) was a Dutch Communist politician and historian.
Ravesteyn studied history at the University of Leiden and was involved in setting up the local branch of the Dutch Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP) in 1898.
With David Wijnkoop and Jan Ceton he was on the editorial board of the left-wing Marxist newspaper "De Tribune" when it was set up in October 1907. However, Pieter Jelles Troelstra and Vliegen, the reformist leaders of the SDAP, found this unacceptable and organised a special congress to discuss throwing out "De Tribune" from the party. They were able to get a clear majority for this at the congress held on February 14, 1909. The "De Tribune" group founded the Social Democratic Party (SDP) on March 14, 1909.
He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1918 and was an MP until 1926, although he left the Communist Party of Holland (as the SDP was then known) in 1925. He was also a local councillor in Rotterdam from 1919 to 1927. He was curator of the Rotter Municipal Library.

Scripts At Work

Scripts At Work is a playwriting organisation in Red Deer, Alberta. It was founded in 2003. Aspiring playwrights submit scripts to the organisation each year, and a jury of literary professionals selects some to be developed further under the guidance of professional theatre directors and dramaturges. Literary professionals who have served on Scripts At Work juries include Vanessa Porteous, Trevor Schmidt, Eric Rose, Glenda Stirling, and Mieko Ouchi. The screenplay for the film "Tumaini" was adapted from a script that was selected by Scripts At Work. Scripts At Work also presents an annual award with the Alberta Playwrights Network called the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. Multiple winners of this award first taken a playwriting course at the University of Calgary. Gina Omilon, who was Miss Teen Red Deer in 2012, has won the award twice. Andrew Kooman won the award for his play "She Has a Name" in 2009. Scripts At Work also hosts an annual fundraiser at Red Deer College. Lynda Adams was one of the co-founders of Scripts At Work.

F-Zero Climax

"Nintendo World Report" and "Siliconera" lauded the game for its track editor and Survival mode. "Nintendo World Report" praised the game's extensive Survival and Zero Test challenges, but complained about the Grand Prix's short duration and unbalanced difficulty. While "Nintendo World Report" and "Official Nintendo Magazine" thought it was a graphical improvement over preceding 2D "F-Zero" games, both the former critic and "Siliconera" lamented over its reused graphics and musical assets.
Gameplay.
"F-Zero Climax" is a racing game that plays similarly to its immediate predecessor ("") and the original "F-Zero" game. Players select their vehicles and race around 53 courses while avoiding obstacles such as ice and bombs. Each racing craft contains air brakes for navigating tight corners. A vehicle's health and ability to speed boost after the first lap is measured by an energy meter. Boosting in this manner briefly increases the racer's speed while draining their energy. The player is also rewarded with a stored speed boost for each lap completed. However, this may only be used in tandem with the energy-draining boost resulting in a double speed boost. Vehicles can drive over pink plates scattered throughout the track to replenish energy. Players can damage competitors with two attacks: a spin attack that quickly rotates the entire vehicle, or a side attack. The former is new to the 2D "F-Zero" series. Players can also spin attack during a speed boost. The game offers four control scheme presets, and personalized button configurations.
"Climax" has numerous gameplay modes and options, some of which were carried over from '. In the Grand Prix mode, the player races against twenty-three opponents through three laps of each track in a cup. Each of the four cups available (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum) has multiple difficulty levels. Track selection per cup may vary based on difficulty level chosen. Time attack lets the player choose any track to complete it in the shortest time possible. Zero Test is a selectable option in Time Attack where players may complete in thirty-six time trials on a small section of track. Survival consists of mission-based objectives such as navigating courses with depleted health, and racing an opponent on a short guardrail-less track without flying off-course at the finish line by braking. Completing a series of survival challenges unlocks a character biography with a brief episode summary from the TV Tokyo anime series '. The multiplayer mode is where two to four players can compete simultaneously.
Edit mode allows the creation of tracks. Players can lay track pieces that come in an assortment of sizes and shapes. Each piece has a list of obstacles available. Track pieces are valued at varying points, for example, larger pieces are worth more points. A track may have up to 255 points. Players can participate in races on them, or setup camera angles to spectate artificial intelligence (AI)-controlled racers. Custom tracks can be saved to one of thirty slots for future use and shared with other players via Game Link Cable. The game can also generate a track-specific password that can be inputted on any "Climax" cartridge for conversion back to the custom track.
Development.
Information on "Climax"s existence and title was leaked by Japanese retailers weeks before its official announcement by Nintendo. The game was developed by Suzak and published by Nintendo. It was released exclusively in Japan on October 21, 2004 and sold 5,049 copies during its first three days on sale. "F-Zero Climax" continues to use the Mode 7 graphical effect seen in previous Game Boy Advance "F-Zero" games. Mode 7 allows the track to be scaled and rotated around the vehicle to simulate a 3D environment. It was originally used as a showcase feature for the Super NES "F-Zero" game. Like "GP Legend" before it, "Climax" is tied-in to the TV Tokyo anime series.
Reception.
"Nintendo World Report"s Daniel Bloodworth thought the Grand Prix mode, which should be the focus of the game, is "woefully lacking". Bloodworth criticized track length of the first 3 cups; he clocked-in at per lap and finished three cups within 20 minutes on standard difficulty. He concluded "combined with the low difficulty and re-used environments and music, it all ends up feeling rather unsatisfying." While the fourth cup is more difficult, Bloodworth was taken back by its sudden spike in difficulty—even when playing every cup on Expert or Master. Also, many of its courses were rehashes from the first "F-Zero" game and "GP Legend". During "Siliconera"s playtest, they praised "Climax"s track design and varying levels of difficulty between courses—easier courses are relatively straight compared to later ones which require honed drifting skill. They mentioned the game demanded players to have quick reflexes and master the track layout on difficulties beyond novice since the AI-controlled opponents are unforgivable. Compared to "GP Legend"s controls, "Siliconera" thought the spin attack "is a neat trick to use, that adds a new element to the game." Bloodworth liked the personalized button configurations, especially since vehicles feel stiffer and the game does not allow players to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. "Siliconera" noted players have to be proficient at both types of speed boosting. Bloodworth explained a properly timed double speed boost can substantially alter the momentum of a race. 
Bloodworth said "Climax" is "probably the most polished of the 2D iterations of this franchise." The game features expanded backgrounds, improved track detail, and a more distinguishable separation between the course and ground below. "Siliconera" thought "Climax" could've looked better, but the game "reuses many of the tile sets from "GP Legend" and ""." Furthermore, Bloodworth was disappointed with the music tracks being mostly rehashes from the original game and "F-Zero X"—a sentiment "Siliconera" agreed with. The voice work of the announcer fell short to Bloodworth. He explained the announcer is sometimes helpful, but also report events inappropriately or too frequently.
Siliconera criticized "Climax" for feeling more like an expansion pack than a sequel. They compared the game's Survival mode to "GP Legend"s story mode and consider it not as deep, "but the challenges are much tougher." "Siliconera" thought the track editor and its ability to be shared with other players as the game's greatest feature. Bloodworth concluded "Climax" has plenty of Survival and Zero Test challenges, and slots to save created courses, but the lackluster Grand Prix holds back the game. "Nintendo World Report" and "Siliconera" felt that the game was a likely candidate for localization in regions outside of Japan due to "GP: Legend"s recent nondomestic release, but this never happened. "F-Zero: GP Legend" was released in Japan in late 2003, but the US version was delayed into late 2004 to coincide with the anime's release. "Climax" was the third "F-Zero" game on the Game Boy Advance and the last to be released in the franchise before its hiatus.

Richard R. Murray

Richard R. Murray (born February 3, 1956 in Bay City, Michigan) is the founder of Equity Schools Inc. and has extensive experience in education and real estate. He is most recognized for his solutions involving school formation, operations, and capital finance.
Background.
Richard Murray is an inventor of school operating models and a developer of school facilities. In 1995 he invented the school model upon which Cristo Rey Jesuit High School of Chicago is based. Cristo Rey is an urban, college preparatory school for low-income students that features an internship program in which students work one day per week in professional, entry-level positions in Chicago’s central business district. Many media have featured the school including the television news program "60 Minutes", national publication Newsweek, and a book about the school’s development. 25 other schools in the United States have been based on this model, also known as the Equity School model. Many of these schools are affiliated with the Cristo Rey Network which promotes and supports replication of the model. He has a patent pending on the model as a business method, including applications as charter schools.
He also is known for creating the public-private operating model in 2005 used by Wartburg College and Waverly, Iowa, for the wellness center there known as “the W,” one of the largest NCAA Division III centers in the country. In 2007 Murray invented another high school operating model for The Neighborhood Academy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, providing that college preparatory high school for low-income students with the means to develop a new campus.
Early Years and Education.
Murray was born in Bay City, Michigan, in 1956. He developed his interest in and philosophy of school development while attending The Roeper School, where he was influenced by George Roeper’s views on education and human rights. His education includes The University of Michigan, (B.A.), and Loyola University of Chicago School of Law (J.D.) with additional legal studies at London School of Economics and University of Salzburg. He has taught at the high school, undergraduate college, and graduate levels.
Human Rights.
Murray’s views on human rights led to his activism with helping develop a refugee center for Chicago’s Bosnian community during the mid-1990s, publishing the article "Compensating the World's Landmine Victims: Legal Liability and Anti-Personnel Landmine Producers" and taking roles with the American Refugee Committee, the Center for International Human Rights at Northwestern University School of Law, and Human Rights Watch.

Commercial and Government Entity code

The Commercial and Government Entity Code, or CAGE Code, is a unique identifier assigned to suppliers to various government or defense agencies, as well as to government agencies themselves and also various organizations. CAGE codes provide a standardized method of identifying a given facility at a specific location.
CAGE Codes are used internationally as part of the NATO Codification System (NCS), where they are sometimes called NCAGE Codes.
CAGE codes are referenced in various databases of the NCS, where they are used along with the supplier's part number to form a reference which is held on the National Stock Number (NSN) record. This reference enables users of the NCS to determine who supplies any given part.
The information associated with the entities - name, address, phone numbers, etc. - is catalogued in the H4 and H8 Handbooks. The National Codification Bureau (NCB) of each NATO or NATO-sponsored Nation is responsible for the maintenance of the CAGE code information for entities in these respective countries. There are on the order of 1.5 Million entities in this catalog.
Within the US, any organization wishing to be a supplier to the DoD is issued a CAGE Code by Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), the organization serving as the US NCB. An entity issued a CAGE code must reapply annually to renew it.
CAGE is sometimes expanded as "Commercial Activity/Government Entity", "Contractor And Government Entity", or other, similar variations. According to the DLIS website, "Commercial And Government Entity" is the proper term.. CAGE was previously known as Federal Supply Code for Manufacturers, or FSCM, which was also the National Supply Code for Manufacturer, or NSCM. On older engineering drawings (pre-1980s) it was labeled simply as "Code Ident No" (Code Identification Number).
In the NCS metadata, the CAGE code's Data Record Number (DRN) is 9250 (or 4140 for NSCM); information listed under this DRN identifies very specifically the semantics of CAGE, its syntax and the procedures associated with it. 
Syntax.
CAGE codes are all five characters in length. There is no meaning encoded in the code itself, other than the underlying NCB; it is simply a unique identifier.
See the Code Chart provided by the NATO AC/135 committee (the group of National Directors on Codification) for the syntax of CAGE codes in various countries.

Dana Shires

Dana L. Shires, Jr. (born November 22, 1932) is an American physician, research scientist, and inventor. He was a member of the research team that did the work leading to the invention of Gatorade. He is the co-founder and former CEO of LifeLink Foundation, an organization created to promote, support and assist in the transplantation therapy of organs and tissues.
Early life.
Dana Shires was born in Coral Gables, Florida. His childhood was spent in Virginia and West Virginia. After the end of the Second World War, his family moved back to Florida, where he attended Lee High School, in Jacksonville. With the start of the Korean War, Shires spent three years in the Marine Corps, including a year as part of a Marine aviation squadron on a U.S. aircraft carrier. Following his stint in the Marines, Shires returned to Florida, and in 1954 started his undergraduate studies at the University of Florida. He graduated in 1957, and, inspired by an uncle who was a doctor, continued with medical school in Gainesville, graduating in 1961.
Involvement in the Invention of Gatorade.
In 1965, Dana Shires was a research fellow at the University of Florida working in the nephrology lab under Dr. Robert Cade. During a lunchtime discussion with then Gators assistant coach Dwayne Douglas, Shires became interested in the issue of the players' suffering from dehydration during practice. Douglas had described to Shires how players lost weight and experienced problems with urination. At the time, the prevailing thinking was that players should be discouraged from replenishing liquids lost to sweating during a game. Shires, who had played football in high school, had familiarity with the issue and found the problem interesting, and brought the matter to the attention of Dr. Cade. They, along with Jim Free and Alex de Quesada (two other postdoctoral fellows working in the nephrology lab under Cade), began research on dehydration during physical exertion. During freshman football practice that year, the researchers collected and tested sweat samples. Their testing revealed that each player lost 2.5 to 4.2 liters, or up to 9 pounds, during each practice session.
Under Cade, the team's research ultimately led to the formulation of a beverage that would replenish the sodium, sugar and water lost during strenuous exercise. Originally nicknamed Cade's Cola, the beverage was eventually marketed as Gatorade, and was the first product in what is now the multi-million dollar sports beverage industry.
Dr. Shires has stated, "...perhaps the most important thing that we did was alert people to the necessity of rehydrating in the midst of exercise."
Founding of LifeLink Foundation.
In 1982, Dr. Shires and Alex de Quesada, a colleague in the research and development of Gatorade, started the LifeLink Foundation in Tampa, Florida. According to the organization's mission statement, LifeLink is "dedicated to the recovery of life-saving and life-enhancing organs and tissue for transplantation therapy." As of 2001, LifeLink had a staff of 21 doctors, and performed more than 300 heart, kidney, liver and pancreas transplants per year. The recipients of these organs are often patients who are indigent. Dr. Shires has said, "We've done a lot of good things for people with the money, and we're grateful for that."
In 2012, Dr. Shires serves as LifeLink's Chairman of the Board. His son, Dan, serves as Executive Vice President of LifeLink Tissue Bank, one of six divisions operating under the LifeLink Foundation umbrella.
Family.
Dr. Shires has eight children and sixteen grandchildren. He enjoys relaxing at a country home in Sidney Peak Ranch, CO where Dr. Shires star gazes and studies the local wildlife.

Antoine Seilern

Count Antoine Seilern (17 September 1901 – 6 July 1978) was an Anglo-Austrian art collector and art historian. He was considered, along with Sir Denis Mahon, to be one of a handful of important collectors who was also a respected scholar. The bulk of his collection was bequeathed to the Courtauld Institute of Art and most is on display at the Courtauld Gallery in London.
Early life.
Count Antoine Edward Seilern und Aspang was born on 17 September 1901 at Frensham Place, Farnham, in Surrey, England. He was the youngest of the three sons of Count Carl Seilern und Aspang (1866–1940) and the American heiress Antoinette "Nettie" "née" Woerishoffer (1875-1901). He therefore enjoyed citizenship of both Austria and the United Kingdom. His ancestors had been ennobled after successful involvement with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713. His father's sister Ida was married to Phillip Hennessy, whose sister Nora was the wife of the Royal Academician Lord Methuen.
He had two older brothers, Count Charles Hugo ("Chappie"), born 1899, and Count Oswald Seilern, born 1900. His mother died five days after he was born. Thereafter the three Seilern boys divided their time between their grandmother, Anna Woerishoffer, in New York, and their father in London and Vienna, in the company of nannies and governesses (and frequently chaperoned by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury), though until America entered the First World War Mrs Woerishoffer spent 1912 to 1916 with her grandsons in Vienna. Anna Woerishoffer's wealth derived mainly from the German-language New York newspaper, the "Neue-Yorker Staats-Zeitung", and her late husband's success on Wall Street. Seilern, like his older brothers, grew up with a passion for horse-racing and shooting.
Further education and business career.
After the First World War Seilern relinquished his Austrian citizenship. However, despite this, he graduated in 1920 from the Realgymnasium in Vienna before attending the Wiener Handelsakademie (1920–1921) and then, at the start of 1922, he enrolled at the Technische Hochschule in order to study for an engineering certificate until 1924. He then worked briefly for a Yugoslavian lumber company, and in Vienna in finance.
Early collecting and the study of art history.
A friend in Vienna, the old Count Karol Lanckoroński (Karl Lanckoronski) a large man of huge charm, who had a fine collection of art at his palace in Vienna, persuaded Seilern he should collect also, and in 1931, after the death of his grandmother, when he received his share of an enormous inheritance, he was able to devote himself to the study of art history and to serious collecting. During the years 1930 to 1933 he travelled widely, particularly in Africa, in search of big-game (as the trophies that could be seen at his house at Princes Gate after the war testified) though his bags were reputedly always packed with art books. He even acquired a pilot's license in Berlin.
However, in 1933, Count Karl Wilczek, another family friend who was also an art historian, recommended Seilern take private lessons with the great Hungarian art historian Johannes Wilde, very soon a mentor who was to become a lifelong friend. Seilern shortly afterwards enrolled at Vienna University to study the history of art with Karl Maria Swoboda, Julius Schlosser and Hans Sedlmayr. Unusually, perhaps, his subsidiary subject at university was "Kinderpsychologie" (Child Psychology), taught by a lady who was a pupil of Sigmund Freud and who was vouched for by his friend Jan van Gelder. Seilern wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Venetian influences on the ceiling paintings of Sir Peter Paul Rubens ("Die venezianischen Voraussetzungen der Denkenmalerei des Peter Paul Rubens") which he completed in 1939. Rubens remained a lifelong passion and he later remarked, "Everything connected with Rubens interests me."
Meanwhile Seilern had started to collect seriously, and was being advised by Wilde, and Ludwig Burchard, the great Rubens scholar. His collection of Rubens' paintings would soon include "Landscape by Moonlight" (which was once the possession of Sir Joshua Reynolds), and large numbers of paintings, drawings, copies and modelli also by Rubens, as well as oil sketches by Tiepolo and other masters. Between the wars and whilst studying in Vienna he had kept his art collection in an apartment at Brahmsplatz 1.
The Second World War.
At the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, and because of his British citizenship (he had apparently hung the Union Jack from his house in Vienna), Seilern decided in 1939 to return to England, bringing with him his already large art collection and his library. Based in England now he was able to provide finance to support to another art historian fleeing from Nazi-occupied Austria, Ludwig Münz, as well as helping Johannes Wilde and his Jewish wife to leave Vienna. The Director of the National Gallery, Sir Kenneth Clark, sponsored Wilde who was reunited with Seilern at Aberystwyth in Wales where his collection was important enough to be hidden with works of art from the National Gallery and Royal Collection. Seilern then enlisted in the ranks of the British army (though aged thirty-eight), serving in the Royal Artillery, and in 1940 immediately volunteered for the disastrous Russo-Finnish campaign, only escaping from occupied Norway. It was at the end of the Second World War, whilst acting as a German interpreter in the Intelligence Corps, that he appeared at the door of Professor Jan van Gelder in Amsterdam to pick up three oil sketches by Rubens he had bought for Seilern from the Koenig collection in 1940 and had deposited as 'Swedish property' at an Amsterdam bank.
It was when the war was at its height that Seilern purchased "The Entombment with Donor and the Resurrection" (now called the Seilern Triptych) by the "Master of Flémalle", now usually identified as Robert Campin, one of his finest purchases, which he bought at Christie's as a work attributed to Adriaen Isenbrandt in 1942.
Collecting and cataloguing art 1945–1978.
Seilern returned to London at the end of the war to live in a great gloomy house he had acquired at 56 Princes Gate, South Kensington, where he rarely opened the blinds and electric light was largely eschewed as he said it distorted colours in pictures. At Princes Gate the ground floor was devoted to his enormous art library, and therefore pictures were hung mainly on the first floor, well-spaced, as in a museum. Other rooms in the house, of course, also held pictures: for example, on the second floor there was a charmingly decorated room called the card-room, which was apparently rarely shown to visitors but in which, eventually, he hung his Tiepolos, and behind this was a private study, hung with a group of Impressionist pictures including a fine late Cézanne.
The war over, he resumed collecting works of art, buying them privately for the most part rather than at auctions, never from a photograph, and never when pressed by a dealer, pictures left 'on approval' frequently being returned. He devoted time to studying them in depth and cataloguing them accurately, though he was also a generous anonymous benefactor of public collections; for example, he lent to exhibitions held at the British Museum (he lent his Michelangelo drawings to the 1975 exhibition there - which he would otherwise not have done except that it was being held in honour of his friend Johannes Wilde), and in 1945 he gave the National Gallery anonymously a very fine full-length portrait of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh by Sir Anthony van Dyck as well presenting anonymously to the British Museum in 1946 the majority of the important collection of Old Master drawings (some 1250 in number) belonging to Mr. Thomas FitzRoy Fenwick, which had been assembled by Sir Thomas Phillipps, 1st Baronet in the library at Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham, and which had been catalogued by Arthur E. Popham of the museum in 1935 and bought by Seilern "en bloc" (Seilern retained about two dozen drawings). The proceeds of the sale of the catalogue of his own collection, when it appeared, would be given to the National Art-Collections Fund (now The Art Fund) and the National Trust.
Eventually his collection would come to include masterpieces not just by Rubens (32 paintings - oil sketches and "modelli" mainly, but also some of the artist's copies of Old Masters like Raphael's portrait of "Baldassare Castiglione" - and 20 drawings); 14 small copies by David Teniers the Younger after pictures in the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria during his Governorship of the Spanish Netherlands in 1647-56, commissioned to make a series of prints for the book known as the "Theatrum Pictorium" first published in 1660; and 12 by Tiepolo (including six oil sketches for paintings for the Monastery Church of Aranjuez, south of Madrid), and pictures by Claude Lorrain, Degas, Van Dyck, Quentin Massys, Lorenzo Lotto, Magnasco, Manet, Francesco de Mura, Palma Vecchio, Parmigianino, Pittoni, Sebastiano Ricci, and Tintoretto. There were also drawings by Giovanni Bellini, Pieter Brughel (one of the most important collections of his landscape drawings in existence), Hugo van der Goes, Fra Bartolommeo landscape drawings, Michelangelo, Parmigianino, Stefano della Bella, 30 drawings by or attributed to Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Canaletto, Francesco Guardi, Watteau, Degas, Cézanne and Picasso, and drawings and engravings by Albrecht Dürer. Surprisingly perhaps, he commissioned a ceiling painting in triptych form of "The Myth of Prometheus" for the entrance hall of his home in Princes Gate by his friend Oskar Kokoschka. He also possessed fine Chinese bronzes, Greek vases, Limbourg brothers manuscripts, Holbein manuscripts, and German and Austrian paintings. He is recorded as owning a three-quarter length pastel of his mother by Clemens von Pausinger (1894) as well as a signed and dated bust-length portrait of himself as a boy by Muller-Ury, which was unframed and stored in a cupboard. Starting in 1955 Seilern began the publication of a catalogue in seven volumes assisted by Fritz Grossmann of the most important parts of the collection, though he waited in vain for Wilde to produce catalogue entries on his important Michelangelo drawings.
Death.
Seilern died in hospital in London in the early hours of 6 July 1978 after months of heart trouble (he had had his leg amputated some months earlier and was threatened with the prospect of losing the other); he was 76. He was buried on 13 July in the churchyard in Frensham, Surrey. His family later had the body exhumed and had it re-interred in the family vault at Schloss Schönbühel, approximately 80 km west of Vienna.
Bequest to the Courtauld Gallery.
Whilst he lived he was persuaded by Johannes Wilde, who had quickly been appointed by Anthony Blunt deputy director of The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, to leave the majority of the paintings and drawings in his collections to the Courtauld Institute Galleries, which already had bequests given by Samuel Courtauld, Viscount Lee of Fareham, Roger Fry, Mark Gambier-Parry and other benefactors. This bequest was made after his death with the condition that it be made anonymously, and be called "The Princes Gate Collection". His friend Michael Kitson, another art historian, was given the responsibility under his will of ensuring that the collection was moved to the Courtauld and appropriately displayed. This included his Michelangelo drawings, his Rubens collection, his Tiepolos, the Kokoschka ceiling and Bernardo Daddi's masterpiece "Virgin and Child with Saints" from 1338, which Seilern had purchased in 1956, as well as modern works by Pissarro, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others, and two pictures by Daubigny and Narcisse Virgilio Díaz he had retained from his grandmother's collection in New York. The Courtauld also received his papers relating to the collection.
Not everything at Princes Gate was bequeathed to the Courtauld as the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was bequeathed two paintings: a copy by Van Dyck of a Titian called 'Madonna and Child with St Dorothy' and a painting by Domenico Fetti called 'The Return of the Prodigal Son' and Seilern's nephews and nieces received substantial bequests of groups of art works in the collection, like the Dürer engravings, Greek vases, German and Austrian paintings not in the published catalogue (that hung principally on the bedroom floor at Princes Gate), and the pictures at the farm in Buckinghamshire.
Personal Life and Character.
Seilern never married, was extremely reserved, and his private life is undocumented although he had many women friends, and was evidently fond of his brother Charles's four children, his cousin Paul Methuen (whose pictures he bought occasionally, apparently never keeping them but giving them away as presents), and enjoyed long friendships with scholars like Wilde, Ludwig Burchard, Anthony Blunt, Michael Kitson, and unusually, as he was perforce also a dealer, James Byam Shaw.
After the war he also acquired Hog Lane Farm close to Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where he bred pigs (Courtauld Institute students of the 1950s sometimes alleged to have seen him outside 20 Portman Square in a sports car with a pet pig beside him) and grew orchids and fruit which he enjoyed giving to his friends. For convenience he often rode a moped when in London.
He was a large man with quite a booming voice, and according to James Byam Shaw possessed something of a dual character, being business-like and intellectual with his male friends, but with women of all ages had all the charm and manners of an aristocrat from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Portraits.
He was painted at least twice as a boy by Adolfo Müller-Ury, who was a close friend of his mother and father and who had acted as an usher at their wedding in New York in February 1898, and who, along with the other ushers, had been given a gold cigarette box by 'Carlo' Seilern by way of thanks. The first portrait was in a group portrait with his two brothers which was certainly painted in London in the summer of 1906 and was exhibited at Knoedler in New York in December that year. "The New York Herald", December 5, 1906, called the group 'graceful' and on December 8, 1906 commented that '...The boys are about 4, 6, and 7 years in age, and they have been painted out of doors.' The second was in late 1906, a full-length dressed in ermine with a rabbit on a string (first exhibited in January 1907 at Knoedler and in February 1908 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC). Both are unlocated. A head and shoulders of Antoine (which may have been a sketch for the full-length) was in his possession at Princes Gate at his death in 1978 and its whereabouts is also currently unknown; what appears to be a reduced version of the full-length portrait survives in a private collection in Lucerne, Switzerland; the group portrait is only known through photographs.
Muller-Ury also painted portraits lost of his mother in 1898, two of his aunt Carola aged 13 in 1898 and posthumously as an adult (like her sister she died young, but in a car crash), and his much beloved grandmother, Mrs Charles Woerishoffer, seated in a lakeland, around 1912.
Publications.
Between 1955 and 1971 Antoine Seilern published an illustrated catalogue of his collection in seven parts; he was assisted by Fritz Grossmann. He dedicated the catalogue to his grandmother, Mrs Charles Woerishoffer. The catalogue consists of:

Lewis John Hill (born 5 October 1990) to English parents Andrea Hill and John Hill is an English cricketer. Hill is a right-handed batsman who regularly fulfills the role of wicketkeeper. He was born at Leicester, Leicestershire.
Educated at Hastings High School and John Cleveland College in Hinckley, Hill has played Second XI cricket for Leicestershire since 2009. During the 2012 season, Hill was selected as part of the Unicorns squad for the 2012 Clydesdale Bank 40. He made his List A debut during the competition against Northamptonshire at Sir Paul Getty's Ground, Wormsley. He was dismissed for a golden duck in the match by Lee Daggett, with Northamptonshire winning by 8 wickets. However in his next outing for the Unicorns against Warwickshire he made an impressive 35 before being dismissed by Chris Wright. In the 2013 cricket season he was part of the Unicorns squad, and he experienced one of the most memorable games of his career against Middlesex at Lord's. After the Unicorns were put into bat Hill came in at number 5 and swept the pants of Ollie Raynor to make a comfortable 31. But then what he did with the gloves was extraordinary, taking a good catch and then an unbelievable catch that was one handed down to his right hand side much to the delight of Parsons at 1st slip. Unfortunatley the Unicorns lost the game right at the death when the umpire had no bottle to give a clear run-out. During the winter of 2013 he went to Australia and in just his 3rd game made a delightful 228n.o for Brighton Cricket club vs. Unley. Brighton declared on 308 for no loss, smashing all sorts of records.

The &quot;Hentai&quot; Prince and the Stony Cat.

, also known by the shorthand and , is a Japanese light novel series written by Sou Sagara and illustrated by Kantoku. Media Factory has published eight volumes since October 2010. It was adapted into a manga series in 2011 and a 12-episode anime television series by J.C.Staff, which aired between April and June 2013. The anime is licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America.
Plot.
Yōto Yokodera is a second-year high school student who is arguably the biggest pervert at school. His problem is that he is not good at showing his real emotions. One day, his equally perverted best friend completely transforms and gets rid of his "impure thoughts"; a feat he attributes to the power of the statue of the "Stony Cat". As the rumors suggest, by wishing upon the statue and giving it an offering, one can wish to remove a personality trait from themselves that one does not wish to have anymore. However, this will remove the unwanted trait and give it to someone who does need it.
As Yōto is making his offering to the statue, a girl named Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi arrives to make her wish to be able to be more like an adult and not show her emotions so easily.

Amaryllis (restaurant)

Amaryllis was a restaurant located in the One Devonshire Gardens hotel in Glasgow, Scotland. It was opened by chef Gordon Ramsay, with David Dempsey operating the restaurant on a daily basis for the celebrity chef. It was awarded a Michelin star in 2002, which it held until the restaurant's closure in 2004.
History.
Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay was inspired to launch a Scottish restaurant in his home town of Glasgow on behalf of his protege David Dempsey, who became the first chef de cuisine in 2001. Dempsey had previously been sous chef under Ramsay at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London. Angela Hartnett helped to launch the restaurant. It took Ramsay two years to find an appropriate venue in Glasgow, and set up the restaurant in the One Devonshire Gardens hotel towards the west of the city. It was Ramsay's first restaurant in Scotland.
Seven months after opening, it was awarded a Michelin star. In April 2003, Dempsey moved on from the restaurant to become head chef at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. On 3 May 2003, Dempsey fell to his death from a second floor flat window after apparently breaking into the property.
It closed the day before the new Michelin star list was announced in 2004, which presented Ramsay as the most starred chef in the world with seven stars despite the loss of the star from Amaryllis. Ramsay was on a family holiday at the time. At the time of closing, the restaurant was fully booked on Friday and Saturday nights for the following six weeks with some 770 bookings, but was reportedly quiet the rest of the week, resulting in Ramsay's concern that the service was at risk of losing the restaurant's Michelin star. It had closed for two days a week because of falling numbers of bookings. During the course of its three years, it lost £480,000, and had lost around £200,000 in the previous year.
Ramsay admitted he later felt relieved to close the restaurant following the death of Dempsey, stating, "I am just glad that I am not involved in the saga of David’s family any more and I can finally lock the door."
Ramsay filmed the first series of "Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares" for Channel 4 after the closure of Amaryllis. This led to some confrontations with the restaurateurs on the show regarding Ramsay's ability to advise them on the show. The space was taken over by John Pallagi and Simon Wright, who opened their restaurant Room. Ramsay offered to help the pair as part of the second series of "Kitchen Nightmares", but they declined.
Menu.
Scottish produce was highlighted in the menus and included signature dishes from Ramsay's range, such as lobster ravioli and langoustine poached in a lobster bisque with a purée of fennel. Scottish spring lamb was also on the menu, served with aubergine caviar, tomatoes and a rosemary jus. On launch, the restaurant offered two fixed-price menus at £25 for three courses or six courses for £40.
Prior to closing, it offered a reduced-price menu to customers in the main dining room but kept a more expensive menu for customers in the adjoining drawing room.
Reception.
Lucy Bannall visited the restaurant ten days after it first opened. After a mix up with orders, she was disappointed with the amuse-bouche, but thought the food was "marvellous" by the time she reached her main course. Overall, she felt like it was a bit "erratic" but couldn't pinpoint exactly why she felt that way.
The restaurant was criticised as being too sophisticated for Glasgow, something which Ramsay responded to after the closure by saying "I'd relish the challenge to open up in Glasgow again but I wouldn’t do fine dining, not a three or four course dinner. We were setting the criteria too high and that’s my fault".
Awards and ratings.
Amaryllis was awarded a Michelin star in 2002, which had been previously awarded to another restaurant at One Devonshire Gardens since 1995.

Ignjat Granitz (born Ignatz Granitz; 1845 – December 17, 1908) was a Croatian Jewish industrialist, philanthropist and publisher.
Early life and family.
Granitz was born in Kemenesmagasi, Hungary to a poor peasant Jewish family. In 1864, Granitz finished teacher training college in Györ. He attended rabbinical school in Bratislava, but soon quit the education because of his liberal views. Granitz worked as a teacher in Sárvár, and later in Nagykanizsa. In Nagykanizsa he meet his future wife Paula (née Deutsch), with whom he moved to Zagreb in 1869. In 1870, Granitz married Paula, and together they had four daughters, Olga, Zlata, Štefanija and Janka. Olga and Zlata later married two Jewish brothers, Ernest and Rikard Schulz. 
"Granitz house" was a three story house which was built for the Granitz family in 1886 by architect Hermann Bollé. Granitz and his family were philanthropists as they often aided poor and needy, organizing charity fundraisers. He was an active member of the Israelites Zagreb community. Granitz died on December 17, 1908 in Zagreb and was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery. His wife died in 1917.
The Granitz family lived in the "Granitz house" until the Nazi occupation of Zagreb and Independent State of Croatia establishment in 1941. Independent State of Croatia regime seized all the assets of the Granitz family, including their house. His daughter Olga (married Schulz) was killed on the street amid Zagreb by unknown Ustaša. Second daughter Zlata (married Schulz) killed herself when Gestapo came for her. Third daughter Štefanija survived the war hiding in Netherlands, and fourth daughter Janka (married Wolf) was arrested by Ustaše and later freed by her son, Pavao Vuk-Pavlović, former students. Granitz's grandchildren, sons in law and most family members had been killed during the Holocaust. After the war, in the newly established SFR Yugoslavia, Granitz properties were not returned to the surviving members of his family.
Career.

At first, Granitz was employed at Hartman printing office, and in 1878 they established the joint company "Hartman & Granitz". After Hartmans death, Granitz and his new business partner, Vilim Schwartz, paid out the Hartman widow, and in 1882 they formed the new company called "Ignjat Granitz & Comp.". Skillfully using social connections and trading skills, Granitz rapidly expanded his business with new and modern printing machines. In 1883, "Ignjat Granitz & Comp." became the first Croatian printer of school books in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. "Ignjat Granitz & Comp." also published "Agramer Zeitung", newspapers on German published from 1848 to 1912.

Later in life, he was named the honorary life Vice President of the "Industrialists Union". He was also the member of the Freemasonry lodge "Ljubav bližnjemu" and the city representative in the Zagreb City Assembly. Granitz was close friend of known Croatian painter and politician, Izidor Kršnjavi. After his death, "Ignjat Granitz & Comp." was merged with the printing house of Ivan Novak, to found the Graphic and Publishing Bureau "Tipografija d.d." which published the papers "Jutarnji list", "Večer", "Obzor" and "Svijet".

Built for Blame, Laced with Shame

Built For Blame, Laced With Shame is the fourth EP by American rock band Get Scared, released on August 28, 2012, through Grey Area Records. The album was produced by Erik Ron. It is the only EP without lead vocalist Nick Matthews and the only album with Joel Faviere, after Matthews departed in late 2011 but later rejoined the band in late 2012.
Background.
Since the release of their first studio album, Best Kind of Mess, the band had begun writing material for their tentative second studio album. However, in late 2011, lead vocalist Nick Matthews departed from group due to musical differences, later joining his now ex-wife in Blacklisted Me. The band announced they would hold auditions for a lead singer to give their fans a chance at the position, but later cancelled the auditions after ex-Woe, Is Me vocalist Tyler Carter introduced the band to former Dear Chandelier singer, Joel Faviere, who was later inducted into the band.
On January 9, the band released the track "Cynical Skin", the first release with Faviere, as a single. The track spawned mainly positive reactions from both critics and fans. It was later revealed that the single would be featured on "Built for Blame, Laced With Shame". Faviere announced they were also working on a song titled "Equal to Bullets", but will instead be released on a full-length studio album.
The band entered the studio on May 23 to record what was originally thought to be their second studio album, but was later announced to be an EP. Erik Ron (Panic! at the Disco, VersaEmerge, Attaloss, I The Mighty) produced the EP and announced its release on a new label, Grey Area Records, which currently has Get Scared as its only band. Faviere commented on Erik Ron's invitation to produce the EP, "We quickly all became family, it was natural and it felt so much more personal to be with Erik and the Grey Area team”.
On August 1, the band released another song from the EP titled "Built for Blame" on their YouTube page. Like Cynical Skin, the song received positive fan reactions. On the same day, the band announced the release date of "Built for Blame, Laced With Shame", which is August 28, 2012. A tentative track listing was also revealed. On August 22, 2012 another new song was released from the EP titled "Problematic" on Altpress.

Occupy OC

Occupy Orange County is a Southern California chapter of the Occupy movement, which began with a rally of over 1,000 people at Irvine City Hall on October 15, 2011.
History.
Occupy Orange County was formed by fusing several smaller Occupy movements that had rallied in cities like Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Costa Mesa, and Orange.
On October 25, after the longest public comments session in city history, the Irvine City Council unanimously changed their positions and granted the movement permission to set up tents and camp on the civic center's lawn, establishing a "protest village" for over two months, which featured speakers, music, movie nights and constant free potluck meals.
On January 20 the movement held an "Occupy the Courts" protest on the anniversary of the Citizens United decision at the county's courts in Santa Ana, and then later participated in the December blockade of the Port of Long Beach and February shutdown of the Walmart distribution center in Mira Loma.
In late January the "protest village" moved to Fullerton, where the movement succeeded in getting two of its proposals passed by the Fullerton City Council, one requiring the city to move its money from large banks to local credit unions, and the other regulating credit card marketing to students.
Members worked with the allied group Occupy Santa Ana in April to contest the citations and arrests of local homeless for "camping" by forming "Necessity Village," a week long sleeping protest at Santa Ana Civic Center.
Occupy OC has helped victims of what they called "fraudclosure" to delay their evictions. Members regularly protest political fundraisers, for example as the satirical "Billionaires for Romney."
In July 2012, Occupy OC members documented Anaheim police shooting and protests, and arranged non-violent resistance training for protesters.
In the Summer of 2012, Occupy OC met other local political groups from the Tea Party, Libertarian and Green movements and began work on a joint statement of agreements between all the movements.
On July 4, 2013 Occupy OC led the OC branch of the Restore The Fourth national protests for privacy in the light of leaks about NSA abuses by Edward Snowden. Nearly 100 protesters demonstrated and marched at the Huntington Beach 4 July parade.

La Futura

La Futura is the fifteenth studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top, and its first in nine years, following "Mescalero". "La Futura" was recorded at The Foambox Recordings in Houston, Texas. The album title and album art were released on ZZ Top's home page on 3 August at 11:45 a.m. The album was released on 11 September 2012 and contains 10 tracks. 
“We thought long and hard about what this album should be,” Gibbons said in a press release. “We wanted to recall the directness of our early stuff but not turn our backs on contemporary technology. The result of this melting of the past and the present is, of course, "La Futura".” 
Four of the new tracks — "I Gotsta Get Paid", "Chartreuse", "Consumption" and “Over You” — were first released on 5 June 2012 as an iTunes-only collection titled "Texicali", which met with strong sales and glowing reviews. "Music Radar" summed up the tunes as “ZZ Top crankin’ up some fresh, vital roadhouse blues”. Another track, "Flyin' High", appropriately made its world premiere in space, when the then-unfinished song was played on board a Soyuz spacecraft during its launch to the International Space Station in June 2011 at the request of the NASA astronaut Mike Fossum, a long-time ZZ Top fan and friend.
Reception.
Following its release, the album received mostly positive reviews. William Clark of "Guitar International" wrote, "La Futura is an impressive return to form for this infamous southern rock trio, and includes some of the best music ZZ Top has ever pushed out." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic also praised the album, calling it their best album since "Eliminator" in 1983, while writing that "ZZ Top are celebrating everything that they've taken for granted for decades - they're embracing the sleazy boogie, the dirty jokes, the locomotive riffs, the saturated blues, the persistent lecherous leer, and by doing so they finally sound like themselves again."

Megaupload legal case

The Megaupload legal case concerns a number of related criminal indictments and enforcement actions taken against Megaupload owner Kim Dotcom in various jurisdictions. On 19 January 2012 the United States Department of Justice seized and shut down the file-hosting site Megaupload.com and commenced criminal cases against its owners and others. On 20 January Hong Kong Customs froze more than 300 million Hong Kong dollars (US$39 million) in assets belonging to the company.
Arrests in New Zealand.
Acting upon a US Federal prosecutor's request, the New Zealand Police arrested Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives in a leased $30 million mansion at Coatesville near Auckland on Friday, 20 January 2012 (NZDT, UTC+13). This was pursuant to a request from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that the four be extradited for racketeering and money laundering. The raid was timed for the birthday celebration of Dotcom. Assets worth $17 million including art works and cars were seized. The four men arrested were Kim Dotcom (founder; 38 years old, from Germany), Finn Batato (Chief marketing officer (CMO); 38, from Germany), Mathias Ortmann (Chief technology officer (CTO) and co-founder; 40, from Germany) and Bram van der Kolk (29, from the Netherlands). The number of police officers involved in this operation was about 80 according to Dotcom or 20 to 30 according to the New Zealand police.
On 23 January, Dotcom appeared in Auckland's North Shore District Court for a bail hearing. The crown argued against bail on the basis that he was a flight risk with a helicopter on his front lawn, while defence lawyers argued that the helicopter could not fly far enough to reach another country. They also said that Dotcom denied any criminal wrongdoing. Judge David McNaughton expressed concern at the discovery of two shotguns at Dotcom's mansion during the police raid, and deferred a decision on whether to grant bail, saying that he needed more time to review the submissions. The request for bail was turned down, with Judge McNaughton saying that "he was denied due to the risk Mr. Dotcom would flee jurisdiction and the possibility that if he reached Germany he wouldn’t be extradited to face the charges". On 3 February 2012, an appeal to the High Court of New Zealand upheld the decision to deny bail.
On 22 February 2012, North Shore District Court Judge Nevin Dawson overturned the previous rulings and granted bail to Kim Dotcom, saying that the risk of flight had diminished after his assets had been seized.
On 5 March 2012, a formal request for the extradition to the United States of Kim Dotcom and three other senior Megaupload staff was filed in a New Zealand court.
On 30 April 2012, the New Zealand High Court ruled that around $750,000 of Kim Dotcom's assets could be returned, including a Mercedes-Benz G55 AMG and Toyota Vellfire that had been seized during the raid on his home. The assets in 63 bank accounts and around thirty other vehicles remained in custody. A paperwork error by the New Zealand authorities meant that Kim Dotcom's property had been seized in January 2012 without giving proper notice. The restraining order on his property was granted in April 2012. During April 2012, US district court judge Liam O'Grady stated "I frankly don't know that we are ever going to have a trial in this matter," as he found out that the company had never been formally served with criminal papers by the US.
On 28 June 2012, New Zealand High Court judge Justice Helen Winkelmann ruled that the search warrants used to raid the home of Kim Dotcom were invalid, saying "The warrants did not adequately describe the offences to which they related. They were general warrants, and as such, are invalid."
On 10 July 2012, a decision on whether Kim Dotcom and other Megaupload employees should be extradited to the United States was delayed until March 2013, in order to allow further time for legal arguments to be heard. In December 2012, it was delayed until August 2013.
In March 2013, Dotcom won a Court of Appeal ruling allowing him to sue the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), rejecting the attorney-general's appeal against a ruling in December, 2012.
On 19 February 2014, a New Zealand appeals court overruled the 28 June 2012 decision, declaring the search warrants against Kim Dotcom to be valid. Dotcom's extradition hearing is currently set for July 2014.
Basis of indictment.
The indictment alleged that Megaupload differed from other online file storage businesses.
Media reports covering the case highlighted a number of points from the indictment used to support claims of illegal activity. The indictment provided a number of instances alleged to show criminal behaviour, as well as indicating design points of Megaupload's operating model as being evidence of criminal intent:
Counter arguments advanced.
Schmitz hired the services of Ira Rothken, an attorney who defended several copyright infringement cases. Rothken claims that the raid was unjustly swift and did not give his client the opportunity to defend himself, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of a completely different turnout.
Legal commentators point out that while the indictment may be correct and Megaupload might have acted as a criminal conspiracy as claimed, a number of points in the indictment are based upon selective interpretations and legal concepts (described in one article as "novel theories" of the law) and could be challenged in court. An L.A. Times analysis stated that the author was "struck by how far the indictment goes to find something nefarious"; likewise a TechDirt analysis concluded that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of "flaunting the law", evidence has potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could "come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services". Both analyses concur that other evidence could show criminality; the concerns were not irrefutable. The legal concerns included:
Safe harbor provisions.
The US Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides safe harbor for sites that promptly take down infringing content. Safe harbor does not exist if the site has actual knowledge and does nothing about it.
In Megaupload's case, the indictment alleges DMCA provisions were used for the appearance of legitimacy – the actual material was not removed, only some links to it were, takedowns agreement was approved based on business growth rather than infringement, and the parties themselves openly discussed their infringing activities. The indictment claims that Megaupload executives:
Prosecutors claimed in the indictment that Megaupload was not DMCA compliant, and cited the example of an alleged infringer on the site known as "VV." Over six years, VV had allegedly uploaded nearly 17,000 files to Megavideo.com, resulting in more than 334 million views. According to prosecutors, although numerous takedown e-mails had been sent, none of the files had been deleted.
In a television interview with 3 News, Kim Dotcom denied being a "piracy king", and claimed that Megaupload had applied the provisions of the DMCA and went beyond it, by giving copyright holders direct rights to delete links. He also claimed that the indictment relied on a malicious interpretation of technical issues to construe its claim of criminal intent, and that there was significant legal use of Megaupload.
Criminal defense action.
Kim Dotcom denied the charges filed against him, and retained the services of Ira P. Rothken, an attorney who has defended several copyright infringement cases. Ira Rothken stated that there is no criminal liability for secondary copyright infringement under US law, quoting a similar case involving YouTube as an example of similar accusations which were dealt with as a civil case.
Dotcom initially hired Washington, D.C. attorney Robert Bennett, who had confirmed that he was going to represent Megaupload in the piracy case. On 22 January 2012, Bennett withdrew from the case due to a conflict of interest with another client. As of 23 January, attorney Paul Davison was quoted as representing Megaupload's founder, Kim Dotcom, in New Zealand. At the end of April 2012, a controversy emerged over legal representation. The law firm Quinn Emanuel, retained by Megaupload to argue for the retention of Megaupload's data, claimed in a motion filed to the court that there was a concerted effort by the United States Department of Justice to deny Megaupload fair legal representation. In the brief, Quinn Emanuel alleged that several law firms had dropped out of the case after the DoJ wrote to them over potential conflicts of interest, arguing that they wanted to call clients of the firms as witnesses. Given the size of the Megaupload, Quinn Emanuel claimed that this "conflict of interest" argument could be applied to any law firm with experience in intellectual property rights, denying Megaupload experienced representation in a case where both law and technical issues are involved. Quinn Emanuel received such a letter but rejected the DoJ's arguments.
Techdirt argued that while the founder of Megaupload had a significant history of "flouting the law", evidence had potentially been taken out of context or misrepresented and could "come back to haunt other online services who are providing perfectly legitimate services". Eric Goldman, a professor of law at Santa Clara University, described the Megaupload case as "a depressing display of abuse of government authority". He pointed out that criminal copyright infringement requires that willful infringement has taken place, and that taking Megaupload offline had produced the "deeply unconstitutional effect" of denying legitimate users of the site access to their data. Other legal commentators have disagreed with Goldman's assessment of the copyright charges, concluding that the allegations in the indictment, if proven, would support a guilty finding on charges of aiding and abetting copyright infringement. Professor James Grimmelmann, for example, commented, "If proven at trial, there's easily enough in the indictment to prove criminal copyright infringement many times over."
The defense has drawn on procedural errors by the prosecution to challenge the case. In a judgement in the end of May, NZ Judge David Harvey granted the defendants the right to the disclosure of evidence against them held by the FBI in preparation for the extradition trial. In his 81-page decision, he came to the assessment that the DoJ is attempting to use concepts of civil law, in particular secondary copyright infringement, in a criminal case, which creates legal issues. He also confirmed that the charges in the indictment relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud are not separate criminal acts but dependent on the claim of criminal secondary copyright infringement. In a separate development in the United States, the defense has challenged the case against Megaupload as a whole, claiming that the US has no jurisdiction over a foreign company and that the seizure of Megaupload's assets was unlawful. A second brief points out numerous legal errors in the indictment, declaring it "an experiment in stretching U.S. criminal law well past the breaking point." 
Data retention.
Following the seizure of Megaupload, concerns were raised as to what would happen to the files that had been uploaded by its users. On 20 January 2012, the Justice Department stated that "It is important to note that Mega clearly warned users to keep copies of any files they uploaded" adding that "Megaupload.com expressly informed users through its Frequently Asked Questions ('FAQs') and its Terms of Service that users have no proprietary interest in any of the files on Megaupload's servers, they assume the full risk of complete loss or unavailability of their data, and that Megaupload can terminate site operations without prior notice." On 27 January 2012, U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride wrote:
The Mega Servers are not in the actual or constructive custody or control of the United States, but remain at the premises controlled by, and currently under the control of, Carpathia and Cogent. Should the defendants wish to obtain independent access to the Mega Servers, or coordinate third-party access to data housed on Mega Servers, the issue must be resolved directly with Cogent or Carpathia.
In response, on 30 January 2012, Carpathia Hosting denied having access to MegaUpload files and issued a press release stating
Carpathia Hosting does not have, and has never had, access to the content on MegaUpload servers and has no mechanism for returning any content residing on such servers to MegaUpload’s customers. The reference to the 2 February 2012 date in the Department of Justice letter for the deletion of content is not based on any information provided by Carpathia to the U.S. Government. We would recommend that anyone who believes that they have content on MegaUpload servers contact MegaUpload. Please do not contact Carpathia Hosting.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has started a campaign to allow legitimate users of Megaupload in the US access to their data and wants the data preserved for that reason. It has chosen to represent one such legitimate user in court and thus has sided with Megaupload and Carpathia in asking the court to retain the data.
On 26 April 2012, Megaupload data negotiations began. Carpathia reported that maintaining the data costs over 9,000 USD a day, and wanted to seek a formal resolution on whether to delete the data or release it to interested parties. United States district court Judge Liam O'Grady ordered all parties to return to the negotiating table. The U.S. Department of Justice noted that 35 million USD had been paid by Megaupload to Carpathia, and alleged that Carpathia had knowingly profited from copyright infringement.
Retaliatory attacks by Anonymous.
Following the shutdown of the Megaupload website, the website of the United States Department of Justice and a number of other websites were taken offline following concerted denial of service attacks attributed to Anonymous.
Gizmodo concurred that it was "almost certainly the result of a quickly assembled DDoS Denial of Service attack—and easily the widest in scope and ferocity we've seen in some time", commenting that "if you had any doubts Anonymous is still a hacker wrecking ball, doubt no more". Links posted in chatrooms and on Twitter, when clicked on by unsuspecting Internet users, ran a web version of the application known as the Low Orbit Ion Cannon.
On 19 January 2012, Anonymous released a statement on Pastebin.com accepting responsibility of the mass attacks on websites including those of RIAA, MPAA, BMI, FBI, and others. According to the Russian state-run RT network, Anonymous described the attacks as "the single largest Internet attack in its history".
Other reactions.
Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy said he was satisfied with the shutdown of the website. He found the site's operators were reaping "criminal profits from the illegal distribution of copyrighted works". "The time has come for increased judicial and police co-operation between states" in the fight against online piracy, he said in a statement.
Web organisations have raised concerns about possible effects of the Megaupload case on the future of file sharing, cloud storage, and Internet commerce. Various commentators including John C. Dvorak, Glenn Greenwald, and Julian Sanchez have written on the topic as well, particularly as it relates US government powers to take down a web site without a trial, even without new laws like SOPA. In fact, the U.S. Dept of Justice was able to rely on PRO-IP, a law passed back in 2008, in order to shut down Megaupload.
People who used Megaupload for personal and business storage, such as large audio and video files for family and work, have also voiced their complaints about the fact that they no longer had access to their files on the service. Examples cited in the media included staff at public interest group "Public Knowledge" who used it for large files, and Android cellphone software writers who described it as "one of the best ways to distribute ... There are a number of similar sites for this use, but Megaupload was always the fastest".
In response to the shutdown, a number of other file hosting websites changed the functionality of their services. FileSonic.com, one of the top ten file hosting services, withdrew the ability to share links to files. The site's main page added a banner stating "All sharing functionality on FileSonic is now disabled. Our service can only be used to upload and retrieve files that you have uploaded personally." Other file hosting websites followed suit, including FileServe.com, FileJungle.com, Uploadstation.com, x7.to and 4shared.com, by shutting down, cancelling affiliate programs or allowing users to only download what they themselves uploaded. Another large file-sharing website, Uploaded.to, ceased services for users accessing from United States based IP addresses. BTJunkie, a website indexing torrent files, shut down voluntarily on 6 February 2012. The file hosting site Turbobit.net blocked access to U.S. visitors, and QuickSilverScreen, a site offering streaming video links, closed on 7 February 2012.
However, other file hosting companies felt no need to change, with MediaFire's CEO Derek Labian saying that he and his file hosting company are not concerned by the Megaupload incident because "Megaupload was making a ridiculous amount of money with a ridiculously bad service... We don’t have a business built on copyright infringement." A spokesperson for RapidShare similarly expressed a lack of concern, saying that "file hosting itself is a legitimate business", pointing out that Microsoft's SkyDrive operates on a similar basis.

Eli S. Strand, Jr. was a professional American football player who played offensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers and New Orleans Saints. He was also a taxi squad member of the 1965 NFL Champion Green Bay Packers in the year immediately preceding the first Super Bowl.
In his later years, he was a frequent caller to sports radio station WFAN in New York City. He was known as "Eli from Westchester" and was known for invoking race into virtually every single phone call, often infuriating the hosts, which often resulted in the hosts banning him from calling into the station.
By his own admission his penchant for looking for racism contributed to his early exit from the NFL. While with the Saints, he tried to organize several black players to take action against team management for better working conditions.

Ron Pinkney

Robert Theron "Ron" Pinkney (May 26, 1935 – present) is an American pioneer broadcaster who was the first African American play by play announcer on a major television network (ABC). The game was played at the Memorial Stadium in Jackson, Mississippi between Mississippi Valley State and Jackson State.
Early life.
Ron Pinkney was born to Robert Pinkney and Catherine Staton at Freedmans Hospital in Washington, DC on Sunday, May 26, 1935. He was raised in Annapolis, Maryland and attended Stanton Elementary School and graduated from Bates High School in Annapolis. He attended Morgan State University in Baltimore and later the Baltimore School of Engineering.
Journalist and radio career.
Ron’s first journalist job was an Annapolis correspondent for the "Baltimore Afro-American" newspaper in 1955.
His first broadcasting job was on radio station WANN in Annapolis, MD. He was a Dee Jay at WEBB in Baltimore, MD from 1960–1962.
In 1963, while a deejay in Maryland, he began a career in sportscasting at his alma mater, Bates High School. He hosted two daily sports shows and did play by play at football and basketball games. He did his first college broadcasts at Maryland State (University of MD-Eastern Shore) and Delaware State University in 1964. Coaching legend Vernon “Skip” McClain's MSU Hawks teams were aired twice on WANN Radio in Annapolis. The Hawks were Black College Football National champions during this era. Ron became the Drive Time morning newscaster at WOL, the top rated station in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. He later was promoted to the News Director and employed three other on-air newscasters.
From 1968 to 1970, he was the voice of Morgan State football on WEBB, when the Golden Bears were coached by the legendary head coach Earl Banks, and featured future NFL stars Raymond Chester (Oakland Raiders), CB Mark Washington (Dallas Cowboys) and prominent alumnus William Rhoden, a track star, and "New York Times" columnist. The Bears enjoyed a 33-game winning streak from 1967-1970 when Sam Lacy, Afro-American newspapers, sportswriter George Taliaferro, a former star halfback and Big Ten All-American at Indiana (NFL Baltimore Colts), and Ralph Jones (son of Grambling president R.W.E. Jones) were color commentators in the broadcasting booth.
Television years.
Pinkney was the first black sportscaster to work a televised broadcast when he covered the famed Orange Blossom Classic, the Black college football spectacular set in Miami, Florida in the Orange Bowl arena. It was a closed circuit television production pitting the host Florida A&M University versus Jacksonville State University, Alabama. The FAMU Rattlers Hall of Fame head coach and then athletic director Alonza “Jake” Gaither handpicked him to work with another popular Atlanta broadcaster, Chico Renfro. The game was piped into the campus of the Florida A&M and Jacksonville State University, Alabama (the first white school to play in the All-black classic. Pinkney was hired as a weekend sportscaster at WTTG, channel 5 (Washington, DC) and teamed with Connie Chung, the weekend news anchor and Maury Povich, who anchored the week night sports show. Pinkney hosted a weekly half hour black news program on Saturday nights from 10:30 pm to 11:00 pm. He later became the weekend sportscaster on the 10:00 pm newscast from 1970-1973.
From 1971-1974, Pinkney was brought in to perform play by play duties for the syndicated Grambling University football games. He worked with the iconic sports information director Collie Nicholson, who masterminded the Tigers rise to national prominence. Grambling football was under the guidance of the legendary Hall of fame coach Eddie Robinson, who went on to become one of the top all-time winningest coaches in all of football. He replaced another famous athlete and actor Fred “The Hammer” Williamson who was the lone announcer in 1970. Pinkney assumed the solo role in the Grambling booth in 1971. In 1972, former Dallas Cowboys runningback Don Perkins was added as a color commentator. Los Angeles sports writer Betty Smith, considered the first woman sideline reporter was brought on board. Grambling football games were seen in ninety-four markets on a one–hour taped delay.
In 1974, Pinkney became the Sports Director of the Mutual Black Network in Washington, DC. He was the play by play voice of the MBN Black College Game of the Week.
The fourteen-game package was a historic first for Black college sports coverage. Joining the broadcast team were former NFL star Roger Brown in 1975 and Tom Gatewood (Notre Dame)in 1977. The games were aired through 1979. Pinkney was the Sports Director for National Black Network (NBN) from 1979-1991.
ABC TV broadcast three HBCU games with Ron and Don Perkins handling the play by play and color commentary, thus earning Pinkney the distinction of being the first African American play by play announcer on a major television network. That game pitted Mississippi Valley State versus Jackson State in Jackson, Mississippi. Pinkney was selected to head the MBN coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, and he covered the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles for National Black Network. (Dr. Leroy T. Walker, North Carolina Central University was named head coach of the US contingency).
In 1978, Pinkney was the color commentator for the CIAA Invitational Tournament held at the Norfolk Scope in Virginia (Les Keiter did play by play). In 1979, NBC-TV was in the second year of coverage of the Black college historic tournament when he did play by play. It was the first regional television broadcast for the Peacock Network and the CIAA. Joining Pinkney in the broadcast booth were ex-North Carolina Central great and Boston Celtics Hall of Famer Sam Jones. The tournament highlight was Virginia Union’s men’s victory over Norfolk State. Dave Robbins, a white coach, won his first CIAA title which came at the expense of the Spartans under Hall of Fame coach Lucious Mitchell (he guided Kentucky State’s men’s team to the second three-peat championships in the NAIA history (1970–1972).
Pinkney finished his fifty-five-year career at Hampton University as the play by play commentator for basketball and football games.
Note: Pinkney was a good luck charm for nearly all of the teams he covered as they claimed at least two conference and/or national championships:

Alexander Potebnja

Alexander Potebnja or Oleksander Opanasovich Potebnia (Russian Александр Афанасьевич Потебня; Ukrainian Олександр Опанасович Потебня) was a Russian-Ukrainian philosopher and linguist active in the Russian Empire, who was a professor of linguistics at the University of Kharkiv.
Life and career.
Alexander Potebnja was born into a noble family in 1835 on his family's khutir Manev, near the village of Havrylivka in Romny county, Poltava oblast . He received his primary education in the Polish school of the city of Radom. He studied law, history, and philology at Kharkiv University (PH D, 1874). In the early 1860s he was active in the Ukrainophile Kharkiv hromada, wrote a Ukrainian primer for Sunday schools, and took part in folklore expeditions in Poltava and Okhtyrka counties. His teachers were the brothers Peter and Nikolai Lavrov and Professor Ambrose Metlinsky. He graduated from the University in 1856, served briefly a teacher of literature at a school in Kharkiv, and then in 1861 he defended his master thesis "Certain characters in the Slavic folk poetry," before beginning to lecture at the University of Kharkiv. In 1862 he published his work "Thought and Language", and in the same year he went on a trip abroad. He attended lectures at the University of Berlin, he studied Sanskrit and visited several Slavic countries. In 1874 he defended his doctoral dissertation entitled "Notes on Russian Grammar". In 1875 he became a professor at Kharkiv University. He also presided over the Kharkiv Historical-Philological Society (1877–90) and was a member of the Czech Scientific Society (from 1887).
Work.
As a linguist Potebnja specialized in four areas: the philosophy of language, the historical phonetics of the East Slavic languages, etymology, and Slavic historical syntax. His major works on the philosophy of language are "Mysl’ i iazyk" (Thought and Language, 5 edns, 1862, 1892, 1913, 1922, 1926); "O sviazi nekotorykh predstavlenii v iazyke" (On the Relation among Some Representations in Language, 1864); his doctoral dissertation, "Iz zapisok po russkoi grammatike" (From Notes on Russian Grammar, vol 1, 1874; repr 1958); and the posthumously published ‘"Iazyk i narodnost"’ (Language and Nationality, in "Vestnik Evropy", 1895). He was particularly interested in the relations among language, thought, and reality. Language for him was primarily the means by which the mind ordered the influx of impressions and stimuli. Words carry not only a meaning, but also the past experience of the individual and the nation, through which all new experience is filtered. Thus a word usually has three aspects: an external form, a meaning, and an internal form. It is through the internal form that the objective world is subjectivized. In many cases the internal form is rooted in myth and, hence, acts as a bridge between language and folklore (with its symbols). These ideas constitute the framework of Potebnja's master's thesis, "O nekotorykh simvolakh v slavianskoi narodnoi poezii" (On Some Symbols in Slavic Folk Poetry, 1860; expanded edn 1914), and his monumental work "Obiasneniia malorusskikh i srodnykh narodnykh pesen" (Explanations of Little Russian and Related Folk Songs, 2 vols, 1883, 1887). With time the consciousness of a word's internal form fades, and one of the tasks of literature is to restore this consciousness. According to this theory, literature is a hierarchy of genres; the simplest ones (the proverb, riddle, and fable) directly recall or renew the word's internal form, and the other genres do so in a more complicated, sometimes hardly detectable, way through a complex system of subjective (in poetry) or seemingly objective (in the novel) images. Potebnia's principal works on this subject were published posthumously: "Iz lektsii po teorii slovesnosti: Basnia, poslovitsa, pogovorka" (From Lectures on the Theory of Literature: The Fable, the Adage, the Proverb, 1894; repr 1970; Ukrainian trans 1930), "Iz zapisok po teorii slovesnosti: Poeziia i proza, tropy i figury, myshlenie poeticheskoe i mificheskoe, prilozheniia" (From Notes on the Theory of Literature: Poetry and Prose, Tropes and Figures, Poetic and Mythical Thought, Addenda, 1905; repr 1970), and ‘"Chernovyia zametki "... o L.N. Tolstom i F.M. Dostoevskom’ (Preliminary Remarks ... on L. Tolstoy and F. Dostoevsky) in Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva (vol 5 ).
Regarding language as an individual's or a nation's only possible means of perceiving the world and of thinking, Potebnja protested vehemently against denationalization in general and the Russification of Ukrainians in particular, and equated this process with spiritual and intellectual disintegration. Potebnja's philosophy of language is rooted in Wilhelm von Humboldt's romantic idealism, but he was also influenced by J. Herbart's and H. Lotze's associative psychology, and particularly by Heymann Steinthal's psycholinguistic writings.
Potebnja viewed the history of a language as the history of its dialects and used the concept of phonetic law, although he often tried to find a psychological basis for the concept. He recognized the existence of a proto-Rus’ language, but located the beginning of its disintegration into dialects back in prehistoric times. He made many discoveries in Ukrainian historical phonetics, such as the primordial dž < dj alteration, the so-called second pleophony, and the conditions for the alternation e:o. He was the first to propose the theory that diphthongs were a transitional stage between Old Ukrainian o, e, and Modern Ukrainian i.
As an etymologist, Potebnja paid much attention to semantic development and the history of words against an expansive historical, folkloric, and psychological background. His major etymological writings were collected in K istorii zvukov russkago iazyka (Toward a History of the Sounds in the Russian Language, vols 2–4, 1880–1, 1883). His annotations to Slovo o polku Ihorevi (1878; repr 1914) are a brilliant synthesis of the etymological, folkloristic, and historical approaches.
From the 1870s Potebnja concentrated on the study of the historical syntax of the Slavic languages against a comparative Indo-European background. His Iz zapisok po russkoi grammatike contains his writings on predicate forms and the participle (vol 2, 1874; rev edn 1888; repr 1958), the noun and the adjective (vol 3, 1899; repr 1968), and the verb and indeclinable words (vol 4, 1941; rev edn 1978). Before his work the field of Slavic historical syntax consisted mostly of inventories of constructions collected from literary monuments of various periods. He revised it to create a broadly drawn picture of category and construction changes tied to changes in ways of thinking, by integrating historical, dialectal, and folkloric materials. His comparative analysis uncovered remnants of prehistoric syntax in later constructions and reinterpretations of archaic constructions in later syntactic systems; that is, it demonstrated the historical character of syntactic categories and parts of speech. Anton Budilovich equated Potebnia's contribution to the field of historical syntax with C. Darwin's contribution to the study of the origin of species.
Potebnja was far ahead of his contemporaries and not very popular during his lifetime. In the field of historical syntax his only immediate followers were A. Popov and, to a certain extent, Dmitrii Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky (in his outline of Russian syntax). His ideas on literature were adopted as a theoretical framework by the ‘Kharkiv school’ (B. Lezin, Vasyl Khartsiiev, A. Gornfeld, T. Rainov, Oleksa Vetukhiv, and others) grouped around the serial Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva (8 vols, 1907–23). They also had a significant impact on the aesthetics of the Russian Symbolists (particularly A. Bely) and an indirect influence on the Ukrainian Symbolists. In 1945 the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (now NANU) was named after Potebnia. Collections of his works on accentology (1973) and esthetics and poetics (1976, 1985) have been published.

Tawkify is a dating website that uses human matchmakers instead of computer algorithms to select matches. The matchmakers set people up on the phone (Tawkifies), on walks (Walkifies) and on Mystery Dates.
Overview.
Tawkify facilitates heterosexual and same-sex relationships in the United States and Canada.
The site's most notable matchmaker is E. Jean Carroll (co-founder). 
The site also uses a robot, Mr. Brooks.
The site can use Klout scores to match users.
Registration may involve less than ten questions.
No user sees any photographs or personal information about any other user.
Users can choose to be matched by phone (a Tawkify), Mystery Date, or Walkify.
Controversy: human versus algorithm.
In the panel discussion "Algorithms and MatchMaking: Dating in the Age of Digital" held during "Internet Week New York", disagreement arose between panelists Sam Yagan (co-founder of OkCupid) and Brian Schecter (co-founder of HowAboutWe.com) over the usefulness of algorithms in online dating. Panelist Amarnath Thombre (Match.com Vice President of Strategy) said: "We've seen algorithms that are four to ten times better than random". Panelist E. Jean Carroll (co-founder of Tawkify.com) explained Tawkify's position: "We take them [users off the internet like that. They're not even allowed to sit around on the internet because that is time-wasting. ...Time well-spent is when you're with somebody or talking."
In an article on Tawkify in Gizmodo, Sam Biddle writes, "Is it so surprising that smart humans are at least as good at pairing up other humans as a computer?"
Matching personalities.
Users cannot see profiles or pictures of other users, which are reserved for matchmakers. In an article in "The Globe and Mail", Tawkify co-founder Kenneth Shaw is reported saying, "We want people to meet by personality first".
History.
Tawkify co-founders are E. Jean Carroll and Kenneth Shaw. E. Jean Carroll is the writer of "Elle" magazine's "Ask E. Jean" column, Emmy Award nominee for writing for "Saturday Night Live", television talk show host and author of four books.

<doc id="36627493" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36627493" title="SS San Flaviano">
SS San Flaviano

SS "San Flaviano" was a 1950s British oil tanker owned by Eagle Oil and Shipping Company, a British subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. She was built by Cammell Laird in England in 1956 and attacked and sunk by the CIA in Borneo in 1958.
"San Flaviano" had a sister ship, , built by Cammell Laird in the same year. The two ships were part of a substantial investment programme to renew Eagle Oil's fleet with larger and more modern tankers. Between 1950 and 1960 the company took delivery of at least 16 new tankers.
Bombed and sunk by the CIA.
"San Flaviano"s career was cut short in 1958. On 28 April "San Flaviano" was in Balikpapan Harbour, in the East Kalimantan Province of Borneo, when a Douglas B-26 Invader bomber aircraft, flown by the CIA and painted black and with no markings, bombed and sank her. "San Flaviano" had nearly finished discharging a cargo of crude oil, leaving her tanks full of highly flammable gas. The CIA aircraft hit "San Flaviano" with one or more bombs amidships on her starboard side. Fire and explosions spread rapidly along that side of the ship, either destroying her starboard lifeboats or making them inaccessible. Nevertheless her officers and crew launched both port lifeboats within four minutes, successfully evacuating everyone including a passenger, the Chief Officer's wife. "San Flaviano" sank near the entrance of Balikpapan harbour.
In response, Royal Dutch Shell suspended its tanker service to Balikpapan and evacuated shore-based wives and families to Singapore. Most of "San Flaviano"s complement were also evacuated to Singapore, travelling on two oil tankers of Anglo-Saxon Petroleum, another of Royal Dutch Shell's British subsidiaries. The first 26 from "San Flaviano" left that same day on , which had had a narrow escape in the same air raid. Another 24 from "San Flaviano" followed a few days later on , leaving the Master (Captain Jack Bright) and his senior officers as the only people from "San Flaviano" still in Balikpapan.
In June 1958 both the Indonesian and UK governments claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels. In fact only the radio operator was from the Permesta rebels in North Sulawesi. The B-26, its bombs and its pilot, former USAAF officer William H Beale, Jr were sent by the CIA as part of US covert support for the rebellion. The CIA pilots had orders to target commercial shipping in order to drive foreign merchant ships away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and destabilising the Indonesian government of President Sukarno. Shell's suspension of operations and partial evacuation of personnel was exactly what the CIA attack was intended to achieve.
For some months previously, UK Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd had supported US policy to aid Permesta. On 6 May 1958, more than a week after the CIA sank "San Flaviano", Lloyd secretly told US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that this was still his position. On 18 May, Indonesian forces shot down a different Permesta B-26 and captured it its CIA pilot, Allen Pope. Nevertheless, in June 1958 both Indonesia and the UK publicly claimed that the aircraft had been flown by Indonesian rebels, concealing the CIA involvement of which both governments were well aware.

William Alexander Ott (1872–1951) was Mayor of Invercargill 1910–1912. During his mayoralty, the Invercargill tram network was opened.
Biography.
Ott was born in Invercargill in 1872. The Ott family came from the German village Dörnach, which is these days part of Pliezhausen in Tübingen. His uncle Johan Jacob Ott came to Dunedin in the early 1850s. In New Zealand, he was known as Jacob Ott. He was a shoemaker and came out employed by the Lutheran Mission under Johann Friedrich Heinrich Wohlers. Not a missionary himself, he later owned the Whitehouse Hotel in Waikiwi.
Jacob Ott financed two of his siblings to come out to New Zealand; his brother Johan Georg Ott (known in New Zealand as George Ott) and his sister Maria Barbara Ott (who appears on the shipping list as Elizabeth). They arrived on the "Maori" on 16 April 1857 in Dunedin from London. George Ott, a tailor, was the father of William Ott. His father married Margaret Ott (née Murray) in 1862 at Dunedin. William Ott had two siblings; a brother and a sister.
William Ott trained as an accountant and became a fellow of the New Zealand Accountants' and Auditors' Association.
He was elected onto the Invercargill Borough Council in 1900. In April 1910, he was elected unopposed to the Invercargill mayoralty. A year later, he was re-elected unopposed. Ott did not contest the 1912 mayoral election; it was won by William Benjamin Scandrett, who defeated Andrew Bain.
During his mayoralty, he opened the electric Invercargill tram network, with the Prime Minister Joseph Ward in attendance. It was the southernmost tram system in the world. At the occasion, Ott was handed a cloak from the late paramount chief Topi Patuki. The Ott family returned the cloak to descendants of Patuki after six members of his family died in May 2006 when the fishing vessel "Kotuku" overturned in Foveaux Strait.
Family and death.
On 17 April 1901, he married Isabella Frew Ott (née Campbell) of Invercargill. They had two sons and one daughter: William Frew Murray Ott (1903–1993; known as Murray), Alexander Bruce Ott (known as Bruce), and Marjory Isabel Ott (b. 1908). His wife died in 1922. In 1925, he married Marjory Forsyth Ott (née Dobie). His second wife died in 1945.
His sister Margaret died in 1870 aged four months. His mother Margaret died in 1907 and his father George died in 1909. His oldest brother John George Ott died in 1954. William Ott died on 4 January 1951, aged 78 years. All are buried in the family grave in the Invercargill Eastern Cemetery.

Mahkamah Mosque

The Mahkamah Mosque (also known as Mosque of Birdibak or Madrasa of Amir Bardabak; Arabic transliteration: "Jāmi' al-Mahkamah al-Birdibakiyyah") is a congregational mosque and "madrasa" located along Baghdad Street near the main western entrance of the Shuja'iyya district in Gaza City, Palestine.
History.
The mosque was built in 1455 on the orders of Sayf al-Din Birdibak al-Ashrafi, the "dawadar" of the Mamluk sultan Sayf al-Din Inal. Birdibak was highly religious and convened an annual conference to discuss the hadith of the 9th-century Muslim scholar Muhammad al-Bukhari. He reached high positions within the Mamluk state and built two other Friday mosques in Damascus and Cairo. The Mahkamah Mosque was originally part of a "madrasa" ("religious school"), and education served as the building's principal function. Prayers were also held regularly and on Fridays.
During Ottoman rule between the 16th and early 20th centuries, the school functioned as a courthouse for the city's "qadis" ("judges"), hence its Arabic name "al-Mahkamah" ("the Court.") In the late 19th-century Swiss scholar Max van Berchem found a Kufic inscription fixed over the "mihrab" ("pulpit") of the mosque that belonged to the tombstone of Muhammad ibn al-Abbas al-Hashimi, a member of the Hashemite family who had died in Gaza in the late 9th-century. On top of the mosque's entrance is the foundation inscription crediting Birdibak for the mosque's construction and honoring Sultan Inal. 
During the British Mandate period following World War I it served as boy's religious school under the name Madrasa al-Shuja‘iyya al-Amiriyya. Today, the mosque continues to be used for prayers throughout the day.
Architecture.
The mosque was constructed in the Burji Mamluk style. It serves as a unique example of Mamluk architecture, having been highly influenced by earlier Ayyubid mosque-madrasas. In particular, the niches of the northern facade strongly resemble the architectural elements of Ayyubid structures in Egypt and Syria. The complex consists of a central "sahn" ("courtyard") situated 1.2 meters below street level. There are several ablution places in the courtyard area. 
North of the courtyard is the facade where the main entrance is located. The entrance portal is topped by a pointed arch with floral decorations. The northern part of the mosque consists of the entrance hall and three other rectangular-shaped rooms each measuring 3.77 meters by 3.69 meters. Each room, including the entrance hall, is topped by a small dome. The southern part of the complex was laid out in a similar manner, but is currently in ruins. The rooms on both sides of the mosque served as lodging for the sheikh and his students and provided other services as well. This particular layout makes the Mahkamah Mosque the only "madrasa" of its kind still standing in Gaza. 
The courtyard is bordered to the southwest by the "iwan". The "iwan" is divided into three sections and is the largest part of the mosque complex. The central portion serves as the principal section and is covered by a fan-shaped cross vault. It contains the "mihrab" ("niche" that indicates the "qibla" which is the direction towards Mecca) and the "minbar" ("pulpit"). The "minbar" is adorned with marble paneling, floral motifs and Qur'anic inscriptions. The main section is bordered by two smaller outer sections with barrel vaulting and pointed arches connecting both structures with the main section. In the northwest, a smaller Mamluk-era "iwan" that previously faced the main "iwan" is presently extant. The western facade is mostly in ruins as well.
In the northwestern corner of the mosque is the Mamluk-style minaret. The base of the minaret is rectangular, while the shaft is composed of two octagonal stories topped by the octagonal muezzin's gallery. The sides of the base contain niches that "alleviate the austerity of the structure" according to Islamic art researcher Mu'en Sadeq. The octagonal levels of the minaret's body are designed with embrasures decorated with translucent floral and geometric ornamentation. The embrasures allow light and ventilation into the interior spiral staircase that leads to the muezzin's gallery which rests on stone muqarnas.

Elswick Hopper

Elswick Hopper was a United Kingdom-based manufacturer of bicycles, formed by the merger in 1913 of the Elswick and Hopper cycle companies. The residual bicycle brands are now owned by Tandem Group
History.
Frederick Hopper was born in 1859, and in 1880 started a bicycle repair business in a former blacksmith's shop in Barton-upon-Humber. He then started manufacturing bicycles, and by 1906 F. Hopper & Co. Ltd was employing 400 people. By 1912 the company was exporting bicycles all over the British Empire, with particularly strong export markets in Australia, India, Japan and South Africa making it a major manufacturing company.
In 1910, Hopper and a series of investors had bought the bankrupt Elswick Cycle Company, which took its name from Elswick, a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne where it was based. Run as two rival companies, in 1913 Hopper bought out his fellow investors and closed the Elswick site, merging the two companies at the Barton-upon-Humber in 1914 under the title Elswick Hopper Cycle and Motor Company.
The Barton-upon-Humber site began to boom, producing both bicycles and many of their own components, where if he needed more production capacity Fred would simply construct another building. In 1936, after the death of Fred, Elswick Hopper was listed on the London Stock Exchange.
In 1974 Elswick Hopper plc began a period of expansion, purchasing Wearwell Cycles, which had been established before 1872. In 1978 the company acquired Falcon Cycles, which was operated as a subsidiary before being later merged at Barton-upon-Humber.
By the mid-1980s, Elswick Hopper plc was a diversified conglomerate, spanning manufacturing, engineering, and distribution. But the company was losing money at both group and subsidiary level, and was in desperate need of reorganisation. Under a new Chief Executive, the group company renamed itself Elswick plc in 1984, and renamed its bicycle division Falcon Cycles, the name of its most popular selling sports bicycle brand. Ending production of bicycles under the Elswick brand in the same year, all bicycle manufacture was moved to a new factory at Brigg. In 1987, the company bought the manufacturing and wholesale distribution businesses of rival Holdsworth, which included both the Holdsworth and Claud Butler brands.
However, by the late 1980s cheap imports from Asia were flooding the UK market, and with a severe decline in the bicycle components industry, the company was reliant on importing those as well, and only assembling at Brigg. By this point, production had dwindled to just under 120,000 bicycles per annum.
Having rebuilt Elswick plc as printing and packaging business focussed on self adhesive labels and garment labels, the group sold the bicycle division to Casket Ltd., a company who controlled the Townsend brand. Having sold the dilapidated Barton-upon-Humber site, in September 1994 the residual Elswick plc sold itself to Ferguson International, which itself went into liquidation in January 2000.
Present.
Casket Ltd with their greater buying power enabled an expansion of the Falcon brand, but themselves ran into difficulty after buying a German-based bicycle manufacturer. Sold to Tandem Group plc in November 1995, the company is now a division of Falcon, which has annual sales in excess of 300,000 bicycles.

Human trafficking in Argentina

Human trafficking in Argentina is the illegal trade in persons for purposes of reproductive slavery, sexual exploitation, forced labor, organ removal, or any form of modern slavery.
It is an international crime against humanity and a violates human rights. It is considered a modern form of slavery. Worldwide it is ranked third among felony crimes, behind arms and drugs trafficking. It accounts for the movement of more than $32 billion worldwide. A United Nations international protocol against human trafficking has been signed by 117 different countries, among them Argentina. This treaty obligates the countries that are party to it to prevent and combat human trafficking and to assist and protect the victims of it. It also encourages countries to cooperate among themselves to achieve these objectives.
In Argentina this crime is punishable by law. There are many laws that cover this problem, but the crime continues to occur. An important legal development in this area was the enactment of Law number 26.364, that tries to achieve what this international protocol seeks. And provides penalties of 3 to 15 years in prison.
Despite being a serious felony, in Argentina there are no official statistics on this crime, only for cases prosecuted. But it is known that the country is a source, transit and destination for trafficking. As a means of preventing trafficking, in July 2011 the government issued an order that banned the publication of explicit advertisements of sexual solicitation in the newspapers.
A recent study from 2012 showed that trafficking for sexual exploitation is changing to evade the law, by allowing exploited women to keep their identification documents or allowing them to leave the location of exploitation, to make the trafficking more difficult to prove.
Federal legislation.
There are many laws that touch on the theme of trafficking; historically the Ley Palacios of 1913 was the first law in the protection to protect victims of sexual exploitation and slavery, as well as to punish those responsible. It was the first legislation in the entire American continent and signified a great advance in human rights in the country. The International Day Against Human Trafficking commemorates the enactment of this law.
Argentina, as a signatory to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, on April 29, 2008 passed Law 26.364 for the Prevention and Punishment of Trafficking in Persons and Assistance to its Victims. According to the dictates of international protocol and emphasizing care and rights of victims and differentiating between adults and minors. It is in accordance with the codes of international protocol and places emphasis on assistance and rights of victims and their differentiation between adults and minors.
Victims.
Trafficking generates victims who in the majority of cases live under inhuman conditions; to be a victim of trafficking involves slavery, in which the trafficker gains a totally illegal right of property right over the victim or reduces her to the level of indentured servitude for the purpose of economic exploitation. In Argentina the most common victims of forced labor are in underground sweatshops are textile or as farm laborers and in other cases domestic workers. As for sexual exploitation that principally affects women, adolescents, and children, they are mostly found in the country's brothels.
Forced labor.
Forced labor includes a variety of trades, but the sectors most affected are rural and textile labor.
Textile industry.
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC – Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos), unregistered labor in apparel approaches 75%. The greater number of these workers are black, which promotes the spread of forced labor. According to Gustavo Vera, president of the cooperative La Alameda (which represents and defends textile workers), "We know that there are about 3,000 underground sweatshops in the Federal Capital" and he adds "There are also some 15,000 underground sweatshops in the first tier of the Buenos Aires suburbs and several thousand more in Greater Buenos Aires, Rosario, Mendoza and Cordoba. These workshops include a population of about 200,000 people who are reduced to forced labor or slave labor, which is the same as forced labor but worse, because the will of the workers is controlled 24 hours a day by the employer." 
Rural.
In Argentina, one of the first protections of the farm laborer was born in 1940 with the enactment of the Estatuto del Peón of farm laborers which gave wage laborers (jornaleros) all the rights of workers (trabajadores). Later, complementary laws were added. The government of Cristina Kirchner signed the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) prohibiting the forced recruitment of manual labor for the rural labor force. However, there still exist recruiting networks that through deception or physical coercion recruit people who are typically in a vulnerable situation. And they are recruited from marginal rural areas of Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Tucuman, Catamarca and Jujuy and from migrant workers from bordering countries such as Chile, Bolivia, and Paraguay. And then they are taken to areas where they do hard labor and live in subhuman conditions. These situations violate the Protocol of San Salvador treaty and International Labour Conference Convention 184.
Sexual abuse.
History.
Sexual exploitation was born in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata before the country was even created. After independence in 1875, a law was made regulating prostitution, preventing prostitution of minors, but allowing it if the children were initiated early into this activity.
In the late nineteenth century "white slavery" rings were established that provided women from Central Europe and Russia, who were sold in a sham marriage to a ruffian. They sought to escape poverty and religious persecution that they suffered. And in this country they were forced into prostitution or sold to another pimp. In the early twentieth century, these trafficking organizations tightened their ties with power. This was in order to be protected by law or to avoid problems in case of breaking laws or deception. Because of their great accumulation of wealth through "kickbacks", they accomplished their mission. Among the customers it is possible to highlight periods of intense European migration that brought primarily single men as main consumers of trafficking, although upper middle class Argentinians also had a high level use of prostitution. By the early twentieth century there were two major international trafficking rings.
MILIEU, a trafficking organization of French origin, and La Migdal, or Zwi Migdal, of Jewish origin, formerly called the Varsovia (Warsaw) Jewish Mutual Aid Society. This last organization came to an end in 1929 when Raquel Liberman, one of thousands of Polish immigrants enslaved in brothels, reported Zwi Migdal to the authorities. And the complaint was taken by a brave and incorruptible judge, which was Manuel Rodriguez Ocampo. Especially since another 150 previous complaints were not successful either because of violence against the accusers or police and judicial corruption. This trial against the organization made it possible to make public the treatment suffered by victims.
After several periods of closure and opening of brothels, from June 24, 1965, Law 16.666 was put into effect that the practice of prostitution is open and not subject to any form of regulation, this law is in effect to the present day.
In practice, this criminal activity is organized on a grand scale and is frequently associated with the illegal drug trade and with arms trafficking. Much of this crime is organized on a global level.
Current status.
At present, Argentina is a source, transit, and destination location for trafficking. What that means is that the victims can be Argentinian or from other countries, that they go through this country, and that some have this as the destination to be illegally exploited.
"Reclutadores" (recruiters) capture the victims through deception or abduction, assisted by "marcadores" (markers) who pick the victims. Then the circle closes with the " "proxenetas" (pimps) who get their profit from the sexual exploitation of victims. And finally the "regentes" (managers) or madames of brothels. There are also carriers and secondary dealers concerned with protecting this whole criminal system. In some cases there is some kind of collusion between members of the police, judges, and politicians.
The province of the country in which the most women are recruited is Entre Rios, followed by Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, Santa Fe and Tucuman; usually victims are rotated through brothels across the whole country. The list of destinations includes Buenos Aires and Cordoba, at the head of the list of destinations chosen by the rings, along with La Pampa, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. There are also links to international rings, especially the route to Spain, where young Tucuman women were rescued.
Recruitment.
There are many recruiting methods but all are either "soft", based on fraud and deception, or "hard", based directly on kidnapping the victims.
There are also cases in which the victim has agreed to work in the sex trade, but then finds out the working and living conditions fall within the category of trafficking. Sometimes these victims only recognize the exploitation after intensive psychological assistance.
Recent studies.
A recent study in 2012 of court cases of the Unidad Fiscal de Asistencia en Secuestros Extorsivos y Trata de Personas Unit of Assistance in Kidnappings and Trafficking in Persons(UFASE) and the Instituto de Estudios Comparados en Ciencias Penales y Sociales for Comparative Studies in Criminal and Social Sciences (INECIP) revealed that trafficking for sexual exploitation is mutating into new forms of subjugation of women, to make it more difficult to prove the existence of slavery in bordellos and thus evading the law. This is a result of the enactment of Law 26.364 in April 2008 that strongly penalizes this offense. The victims have their documents in their possession and in many cases are allowed to leave the sites of exploitation, but the subjugation continues to function in another way. Furthermore the report shows collusion between state, local, police, and judicial entities that "legitimizes the activity and leads to its habituation." Some 72% of cases are enslaved in nightclubs like "whiskerías" (undercover brothels), pubs, or pool halls, all enabled by the municipalities, and the other 22% in private apartments.
Underage victims.
Worldwide, close to 2.5 million people are victims of some form of trafficking. Between 22% and 50% are girls and boys. The exact figure is unknown because trafficking in children is usually hidden; for this reason, reliable data cannot be obtained. Many of these situations occur within cities or urban areas. For example, trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation occurs with girls and boys working on city streets. Many rural children from rural areas are moved to the cities by the traffickers.
According to the Department of State of the United States, that which occurs in the world also occurs in Argentina. Children come from northern provinces, or from bordering countries like Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil. Areas with a triple border are a major focus of child trafficking and child labor, especially of children living in border areas and bordering countries. These end up in urban centers of central and south of the country, where child sex tourism is promoted. Others are victims of forced labor in underground sweatshops and agricultural enterprises.
Under the new Argentine law, child trafficking is punishable by the maximum penalty for this offense. In addition, penalties can be increased if there are aggravating factors.
Interviews about trafficking.
Narrative on trafficking for sexual exploitation:
Narrative of labor exploitation:
Court cases.
The case of Marita Veron.
One of the more well known cases in Argentina is that of Marita Veron, which was brought to court in 2012 after an intensive search and collection of evidence, where part of the network of this country's web of trafficking for sexual exploitation was discovered.
It is known that she left her home on April 3, 2002, and three days later, she was found by police while escaping from a sex party that seems to have been her first destination; she was put on a bus with a group traveling in the direction of Tucuman but never arrived. Later, a witness saw her in one of three Rioja brothels, which the Appeals Chamber of Tucumán described as "places intended for the practice of prostitution where there is a systematic recruitment of women including by means deprivation of liberty." Since then there has been no more information obtained on the whereabouts of Marita.
Marita's mother Susana Trimarco, the principle impulse behind the investigation, has managed to rescue more than 20 women who were victims of trafficking. The Maria de los Angeles Foundation rescues and helps victims of trafficking.
The trial over the disappearance of Marita began on February 8, 2012, and indicted 13 people, 7 men and 6 women, who are linked to the kidnapping and to the promotion of prostitution. It brings together more than 150 witnesses. The trial ended in December 11, 2012 and all indicted people were absolved, the mather of Marita Veron will impulse a political trial against the magistrate.
UFASE's Statistics.
According to statistics taken from August 22, 2008 to March 7, 2012, by the Fiscal Assistance Unit of Kidnappings and Trafficking (UFASE – Unidad Fiscal de Asistencia en Secuestros Extorsivos y Trata de Personas) responsible for assisting the Argentine fiscal units in the processing of kidnappings and trafficking court cases. Some 64% of court cases were for trafficking for purposes of sexual exploitation, while the percentages for trafficking for labor exploitation were 5% rural, 1% textile, and 1% begging. As for sexual exploitation, 77% of the victims were female, 19% male, and 4% transgender. In 70% of cases, the method of recruitment was by "promises of employment", 8% by exploiting the victim's family problems and 8% inducement by romantic relationship, and 3% of cases by the delivery by a family member or acquaintance. Some 52% had no freedom of movement and 45% experienced violence. With regard to the nationality of the victims, 31% were Bolivian, 28% Argentinian, 21% Paraguayan, 10% Dominican, 5% Peruvian, 3% Colombian, and 2% Uruguayan. Source countries for recruitment were 83% in Argentina, 12% in Paraguay, and 1% in Bolivia, while the destination country was 94% for Argentina, 4% Paraguay, and 2% Chile.
Support programs for victims and others.
Office for Rescue and Caring of Victims of Trafficking.
According to the new Law 26.364 that was created in August 2008, the "Oficina de Rescate y Acompañamiento a Personas Damnificadas por el Delito de Trata de Personas of Rescue and Support for People Harmed by the Crime of Trafficking in Persons", is under the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Justice Office. The security forces, professionals in psychology, law, and social work have a similar form. They accompany the victim from the time of their rescue or escape from the place of exploitation and during the investigation of the trafficking crime, later providing support and legal assistance until the moment they give testimony. Victims receive psychological, medical, and legal assistance. Later the victims "testify under conditions of special protection and care"; this can be via a Gesell chamber or one-way mirror.
Victims are "not punishable for committing any offense that is a direct result of being trafficked." In the case of foreigners, no sanctions are applied either. .
The Maria de los Angeles Foundation.
The foundation (Fundación María de los Ángeles) of Maria of the Angels is a nonprofit organization that fights against the crime of human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. The foundation assists victims of sexual exploitation free of charge, and offers legal assistance to victims, counseling for victims and families, and social assistance. It also provides community talks and capacity building for judges, prosecutors, and police.
It seeks to prosecute applicable cases under Law 26.364 and to provide psychological support to victims so they can overcome the traumatic situations they have lived through.
The foundation was founded by Susana Trimarco in 2007 with the help of the Human Rights Secretariat of Tucuman. Since then this group has achieved the filing of more than 800 court cases, and has found and rescued at least 400 women subjected to sex trafficking without their consent.
Susana Trimarco is still searching for her daughter Marita, who fell victim to sex trafficking on April 3, 2002. After investigating the crime of trafficking and its networks, and rescuing many victims, including some under 12 years of age, she decided to create the foundation to help victims and to continue searching for her daughter. The vision of the foundation is to eradicate the trafficking of persons in Argentina.
The María de los Ángeles foundation has offices based in Tucuman and Buenos Aires [http://www.fundacionmariadelosangeles.org/esp/oficinas.htm]. The foundation and Susana Trimarco can count a great many accomplishments and awards.

Religiosity and education

The relationship between the level of religiosity and the level of education has been a philosophical, as well as a scientific and political concern, since the second half of the 20th century.
The parameters of the two components, in this sociological field, are of a different nature : if the "level of religiosity" remains a concept which is difficult to determinate scientifically, on the contrary, the "level of education" is, indeed, easy to compile, official data on this topic being publicly accessible in many countries.
Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. In "western" countries, the higher the level of education, the more the religious practices increase, while certain religious beliefs decrease.
Relationship between education and religiosity.
Negative relationships.
In one analysis of World Values Survey data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote, noted that in 65 former socialist countries "there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God", with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations in many developed countries such as England, France and the US. They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations. 
In Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population. A study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity. An EU survey finds a positive correlation between leaving school early and believing in a God. Frank Sulloway of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Michael Shermer of California State University conducted a study which found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a correlation indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.
Positive relationships.
Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education." He found that Hindus, Jews, Buddhists, and Orthodox Christians have the highest levels of education, Catholics, Mormons, and Muslims are at about the national average, and Jehovah's Witnesses have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education. Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college. 
Sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect. Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education. Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelical and has found that on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than mainline Protestants. He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious. 
Cross-national sociological research by Norris and Inglehart notes a positive correlation between religious attendance among the more educated in the United States. Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education are associated with increased religious participation and religious practice in daily life, but also correlate with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".
Mixed relationships.
Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e. membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. Of those in the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. They also found that professors at elite doctoral universities are much less religious than professors teaching in other kinds of institutions with more atheists and agnostics in numbers, however, both groups were still a minority there also. 
In specific religious denominations.
Mormons.
Studies of Mormons in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than uneducated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41 percent of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76 percent of Mormon college graduates and 78 percent of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending church regularly.
Evangelical groups.
Edward Dutton studied findings which indicate that universities which are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge- factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.
In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs, and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used SAT as a measure of intelligence for this study.
Christian fundamentalists.
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist "converts" were not less educated people. However, a weak "negative correlation" between education and Christian fundamentalism was found by Burton et al. (1989), a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, Protestant residents of Delaware County, Indiana.

White Chapel Memorial Cemetery

White Chapel Memorial Cemetery or simply White Chapel Cemetery is a memorial cemetery in Troy, Oakland County, Michigan
Polar Bear Memorial.
The state of Michigan dedicated a memorial on May 30, 1930, honoring the U.S. Army's Polar Bear Expedition. It recognizes the efforts of the expeditionary force against the Bolshevik Red Army in North Russia during 1918 and 1919.
Discrimination.
On August 10, 1960, an honorably discharged 66-year-old World War I veteran, George Vincent Nash, was removed from resting alongside his Caucasian wife at the White Chapel Cemetery.
The action took place immediately following the graveside service because Nash was a full-blooded Ho-Chunk (also known as Winnebago) or Native American. The explanation was that 40,000 plot owners "had paid for the restriction" for the type of people that could be buried at White Chapel Cemetery. According to the cemetery's officials, corpses had to be at least 75% Caucasian to be buried at White Chapel. The governor, G. Mennen Williams, was concerned about the legality of the cemetery's actions. However, the Michigan state legislatures in both 1961 and 1962, failed to pass bills that would have prohibited cemeteries to discriminate who could be interned in them on the basis their race.

Carlo Abbate

Carlo Abbate (c. 1600 – before 1640) was an Italian music theorist, composer, and Franciscan priest. Born in Genoa, he served as chaplain and musician to Cardinal Franz von Dietrichstein, Prince-Bishop of Olomouc, and governor of Moravia.
Before 1629, he taught music at the Seminary at St Oslowan; afterwards, he taught at the newly established Loretan Seminary at Nikolsburg, which was the cardinal's principal residence. When Abbate returned to Italy in 1632, he published his treatise, "Regulae contrapuncti excerptae ex operibus Zerlini et aliorum ad breviorem tyronum instructionem accommodate", which was intended to be used as a textbook for his seminarians. The treatise mainly consists of already established rules regarding consonance and dissonance.
The book was adapted from the works of Gioseffo Zarlino.

Philo is the Hellenistic Jewish author of an epic poem in Greek hexameters on the history of Jerusalem. He lived at an earlier date than Philo the philosopher. Alexander Polyhistor (c. 105-35 B.C.) quotes several passages of the poem, and is the source of the extracts in Eusebius ("Praeparatio evangelica", ix. 20, 24, 37). This is probably the Philo who is mentioned by Clemens Alexandrinus ("Strom", i. 21, 141) and by Josephus ("Contra Apionem", i. 23), who calls him "the elder".

Tiny Tim (comic strip)

Tiny Tim is an American Sunday strip created by Stanley Link. It ran from circa July 23, 1933 March 2, 1958. It followed the adventures of Tim Grunt and his sister Dotty, both only two inches tall at the start of the strip. However, they grew six inches during the first three months. After that, they were taken in by a farm couple. Eventually, a gypsy grew them to slightly less than normal size, and Dotty disappeared. On April 13, 1941, the gypsy gave Tim an amulet that said "Nemesis of All Evil". By saying the words out loud, Tim could return to being two inches tall, then grow back to normal size. In 1957, Link died, and on March 2, 1958, the strip ended. "Tiny Tim" was once popular, but has since faded into obscurity.

Wallowa County Courthouse

The Wallowa County Courthouse is the seat of government for Wallowa County in northeastern Oregon. The courthouse is located in Enterprise, Oregon. It was built in 1909–1910 using locally quarried stone. It is a massive High Victorian structure built of local Bowlby stone. The courthouse was listed on National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Today, the courthouse still houses Wallowa County government offices.
History.
Wallowa County is located in the northeastern corner of Oregon. It is bordered by Union and Umatilla counties to the west, Union and Baker counties to the south, the state of Washington on the north, and Idaho to the east. The county is bordered geographically by the Wallowa Mountains on the south and west, the Grande Ronde River canyon on the north, and the Snake River and Hells Canyon on the east.
The first post office in the Wallowa Valley was established in 1874. The first town in the area was Lostine, which was founded in 1875. The town of Joseph was established in 1879. Wallowa County was formally separated from Union County in February 1887, the same year the town of Enterprise was founded. When the county was first formed, Joseph became the interim county seat. However, Enterprise was selected as the permanent county seat of Wallowa County in 1888.
Originally, the Wallowa County government rented office space on the second floor of a building on Main Street in Enterprise. In 1898, citizens proposed building a courthouse, but county officials decided it was cheaper to continue renting office space. A decade later, county officials finally decided to build a permanent court building to house county offices. Local citizens contribute $5,000 for construction of the courthouse, but refused to pay until construction reached the second story, ensuring that the courthouse would actually be built as promised by county officials. The contributors also insisted that the total cost of the courthouse be at least $25,000 to ensure the structure would be a well-built landmark for the community.
The courthouse was designed by Calvin R. Thornton, an architect from La Grande, Oregon. The construction contract was won by S. R. Haworth for $31,300. Haworth began work on the building in January 1909. The plumbing and heating work was done under a separate sub-contractor, costing an additional $4,592. Thornton moved to Enterprise to supervise to the courthouse construction. However, he was killed in December 1909 when he fell from a scaffold at another job site in Enterprise. As a result, he never saw the finished courthouse. In March 1910, a local furniture company was awarded a $3,183 contract to provide furniture, counters, and bar railings to finish the courthouse. The courthouse opened for business on 5 January 1910. However, construction was not actually completed until May of that year.
Over the years, minor modifications have been made to the courthouse building. For example, the original boiler was replaced in 1927. In the 1970s, several window air conditioning units were installed. Aluminum storm doors were added to the front and rear entrances in 1981. This was accomplished without altering the original wooden entry doors. A concrete handicap-accessible ramp was also added to rear entrance in 1981. Other changes made over the years include adding partitions and paneling, installing carpet, lowered ceiling, and added fluorescent lights.
Because the Wallowa County courthouse is one of the few early 20th century county government building in eastern Oregon that has retained its original character, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 14 July 2000. Today, the courthouse is still being used for its original purpose.
Structure.
The Wallowa County courthouse is an imposing stone structure, built in center of "Courthouse Square" with the main facade facing west. The courthouse was built in the High Victorian style with massive stone facades on all four sides. The building has some Queen Anne elements, such as multiple roof forms, segmental windows arches, and patterned shingles. The courthouse is three stories high including a usable attic. The courthouse also has a full basement. It has a rectangular footprint measuring (east–west) by (north–south). The top of the cupola is above ground level.
There are concrete steps leading up to the front and rear entrances. A concrete wheelchair ramp was added at the east entrance in 1981. Both the front and rear entrances have double doors recessed under an entry arch. The doors have glazed beveled-glass inset windows. There are clear beveled-glass sidelights flanking the entry doors with floral-patterned glass transoms above the each entrance.
The basement floor is concrete. The first and second story floors are supported by wood beams with wood sub-floors covered by fir floor boards. The load bearing walls on the first and second floors are brick with a plaster finish. Non-load bearing walls and stairs are wood-frame. The hip-roof is wood-frame except for the roof over the court room which is supported by two massive trusses. The trusses carry a pyramid-shaped coffered ceiling that is currently hidden by a modern suspended ceiling. The portion of the roof visible from the street is covered with asbestos tiles that are a charcoal gray color. Beyond the visible roof is another lesser pitched hip-roof covered with asphalt roofing. The courthouse has a white decorative cornice made of sheet-metal running along the perimeter of the building. The building has three brick chimneys. One chimney is in the center of the roof. The other two are above the east facade on a gabled roof extension. The courthouse cupola is a wood-framed element with sheet metal detailing that crowns the structure. There is round metal finial on top of the cupola.
Interior.
The courthouse has a usable basement, two main floors, and an attic. Originally, there were county offices on all four floors. Today, the courthouse continues to serve its original purpose with offices in the basement, first, and second floors while the attic is now used for storage.
The basement has a main hallway with stone-walls runs north to south. The basement walls are a finished rough stone. The ceilings are low with exposed mechanical systems visible in the hallway and office spaces. A small bathroom is located at the north end of the hall. Until the 1970s, there was a basement apartment for the courthouse custodian, who maintained the building, stoked the boiler, and cooked for prisoners housed in the county jail. The mechanical room houses an abandon steam boiler along with a new boiler that heats the building through the building's original radiator system. An exterior stairwell entrance was added in the 1960s.
The public entrances to the courthouse are on the first floor. The double doors at the main entrance on the west façade open to a wide hallway that runs the length of the building to double doors at the rear entrance. There is also a north-south hallway that divides the first floor into office quadrants. The hallway ceiling is high. A staircase at each end of the north–south leads to the basement and the second floor. All the interior office doors are original except for the sheriff's office, which has a new steel security door. There are bathrooms at the north and south ends of hall.
The northwest quadrant of the first floor houses the county clerk's office. The clerk's area includes a main office, a research room, and a vault. The northeast quadrant houses the sheriff's office. It includes offices for the sheriff and deputy sheriffs along with a reception area. The northeast corner of the building originally had a women's jail; however, the cells were removed in 1997 and the area was converted into office space. The jail and the treasurer's office are located in the southeast quadrant. The original cells remain intact, but are only used to temporary hold prisoners who are being booked or who are making a court appearance. The treasurer's office suite includes the treasurer's office and a reception area. The southwest quadrant houses offices for the Veteran's Administration and the county assessor.
The second floor has a single hallway, running north-south. There are offices on the west side of that hall with the county's courtroom and court offices on the east side of the hall. The second floor has a small bathroom at each end of the hall. The offices on the west side of the hall include the county commissioner's offices, county administrative offices, the district attorney's offices, a jury room, and a children services office. On the east side of the hall is a large courtroom. The courtroom has a double-door entrance. There are six windows opposite the entrance. An oak balustrade divides the courtroom into two sections, separating the judge, attorneys, and jury from the public seating area. The public area is surrounded by wooden bookshelves. The jury box has 12 oak chairs. The judge's and attorney's desks are made of oak, and are original courthouse furnishings. The courtroom originally had a coffered ceiling, but it has been covered by a modern drop-down ceiling. The court offices consist of three interconnected rooms, a reception office, an administrative office, and the judge's chambers, which is located on the northeast corner of the building.
The stairs to the attic is located at the south end of the second floor hall. The stairway was originally open, but a door was installed in 1981 to control access. The attic was originally used for office space. However, the offices were closed in the 1970s because fire exits were inadequate. The attic is now only used for storage. The attic area above the courtroom houses a massive truss system that supports the courtroom's original coffered ceiling. The attic's dormers and windows were built to for their exterior effect, not for interior lighting.
Courthouse Square.
Originally, the courthouse was surrounded by deciduous trees, but they were replaced in 1925 with spruce trees. The spruce trees were removed in 1989 after several were damaged during a storm. The spruce trees were replaced by oak, pine, maple, linden, juniper, and flowering crab apple trees. There are roses planted on the north, west, and south sides of the courthouse. There is a wood-framed gazebo in the northeast corner of Courthouse Square. The gazebo was built in 1986. It stands on the same location as a gazebo built about 1900. The date the original gazebo was removed is unknown. However, it can be seen in photographs that were taken shortly after the courthouse was built.
There are a number of memorials around Courthouse Square. On the northwest corner of the square stands a concrete arch that is dedicated to the early pioneers of Wallowa County, who arrived in the 1870s. The local American Legion post placed the granite boulder in front of the courthouse in 1925. The bronze plaque mounted on the boulder bears the names of Wallowa County men killed in World War I. In 1985, two more plaques were added to honor those killed during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. A World War I field gun was placed in the square in 1926. However, the gun was melted down during a World War II scrap drive to support the war effort. It was replaced in 1947 with a World War II Howitzer that honors American veterans. A "Fountain of Honor" honoring all veterans of the United States armed forces was dedicated on 9 July 2011.

Nancy Bikin Pembalesan

Nancy Bikin Pembalesan (Nancy Takes Revenge) is a 1930 film from the Dutch East Indies. It was released by Tan's Film Company and a sequel to the 1929 two-part film "Njai Dasima"; it follows Dasima's daughter Nancy on her quest for vengeance. Like its predecessor, it was a commercial and critical success.
Plot.
Nancy, the daughter of a native mistress named Dasima who was murdered several years earlier after leaving her family, returns to Batavia, Dutch East Indies (modern day Jakarta, Indonesia), as an adult. She discovers that her mother's murderers, a "delman" driver named Samiun and his wife Hayati, have returned from exile. In a dream, Nancy sees her mother, who asks that she hunt down Samiun and Hayati and take revenge upon them.
Intending to calm her mother's soul, Nancy sets out in pursuit of the murderers, who have taken what remained of Dasima's wealth and fled to nearby Banten. With the help of a local politician, she finds and chases Samiun and Hayati. Samiun falls down a hole and dies and, when Hayati tries turning on Nancy to kill her, Dasima's ghost startles the murderess into killing herself.
Production.
"Nancy Bikin Pembalasan" was made as a sequel to the two-part film "Njai Dasima", which Tan's Film – owned by the ethnic Chinese brothers Tan Khoen Yauw and Tan Khoen Hian – had released to commercial success the previous year. Unlike the original film, which was based on "Tjerita Njai Dasima" ("The Story of Njai Dasima"; 1896) by G. Francis, "Nancy Bikin Pembalesan" was written especially for Tan's Film. Like most of Tan's productions, it was targeted at lower-class viewers.
The film was directed by Lie Tek Swie, who had previously worked as a film importer, and produced by Tan Koen Yauw. Boby Schonerwald was cast as Nancy. It was silent and black and white and, during production, initially titled "Pembalesan Nancy" ("Nancy's Revenge").
Release and reception.
"Nancy Bikin Pembalesan" was released on 30 May 1930, four months after the second instalment of "Njai Dasima". It was a commercial and critical success. A review in "Panorama" described the imagery as clear, like a Western film, with beautiful views and good characterisation of Nancy, Hayati, and the government official.

Siege of Fellin

The Siege of Fellin took place between March 25 and 17 May 1602 during the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611). Polish and Lithuanian forces led by Grand Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski besieged the Swedish-held town of Fellin (present day Viljandi in Estonia). The large Polish–Lithuanian army of around 5,000 troops first took the town, while the Swedish defenders, numbering around 800, retreated to the city's castle. After a second frontal attack on the castle, during which the Voivode of Wenden Jerzy Farensbach was killed, the Swedish garrison capitulated, although a group of Finnish soldiers refused to surrender and blew themselves up in the castle's tower. Fellin was later recaptured by the Swedes in the siege of 1608.

Mars Orbiter Mission

The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), informally called Mangalyaan (, "Mars-Craft"), is a Mars orbiter launched into Earth orbit on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It is expected to enter orbit around Mars on 24 September 2014.
The mission is a "technology demonstrator" project aiming to develop the technologies required for design, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.
The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC (2:38 PM IST) on 5 November 2013. The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.
The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven altitude-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC). Travelling at a speed of 1.55 km per second, Mangalyan crossed half way to Mars on 9 April 2014.
It is India's first interplanetary mission and, if successful, ISRO would become the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after the Soviet space program, NASA, and European Space Agency.
The spacecraft is currently being monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bangalore with support from Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Byalalu.
History.
The MOM mission concept began with a feasibility study in 2010, after the launch of lunar satellite Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. The government of India approved the project on 3 August 2012, after the Indian Space Research Organisation completed of required studies for the orbiter. The total project cost may be up to . The satellite costs and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other ISRO projects.
The space agency had initially planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was postponed to 5 November 2013 following the inability of ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean. Launch opportunities for a fuel-saving Hohmann transfer orbit occur about every 26 months, in this case, 2016 and 2018. The Mars Orbiter's on-orbit mission life will be between six and ten months.
Assembly of the PSLV-XL launch vehicle, designated C25, started on 5 August 2013. The mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at ISRO Satellite Centre, Bangalore, and the finished spacecraft was shipped to Sriharikota on 2 October 2013 for integration to the PSLV-XL launch vehicle. The satellite's development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months. Despite the US federal government shutdown, NASA reaffirmed on 5 October 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission. ISRO chairman stated in November 2013 that if the MOM and NASA's orbiter MAVEN were successful, they would complement each other in findings and help understand Mars better.
Team.
Some of the scientists working on the "Mars Orbiter Mission" project are:
Objectives.
The primary objective of the Mars Orbiter Mission is to showcase India's rocket launch systems, spacecraft-building and operations capabilities. Specifically, the primary objective is to develop the technologies required for design, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission, comprising the following major tasks:
The secondary objective is to explore Mars' surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments.
Payload.
The scientific payload consists of five instruments:
Telemetry and command.
The Indian Space Research Organisation Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network performed navigation and tracking operations for the launch with ground stations at Sriharikota, Port Blair, Brunei and Biak in Indonesia, and after the spacecraft's apogee became more than 100,000 km, two large 18-metre and 32-metre diameter antennas of the Indian Deep Space Network started to be utilised. The 18-metre diameter dish-antenna will be used for communication with craft till April 2014, after which the larger 32-metre antenna will be used. NASA's Deep Space Network is providing position data through its three stations located in Canberra, Madrid and Goldstone on the US West Coast during the non-visible period of ISRO's network. The South African National Space Agency's (SANSA) Hartebeesthoek (HBK) ground station is also providing satellite tracking, telemetry and command services. Additional monitoring is provided by technicians on board two leased ships from the Shipping Corporation of India, "SCI Nalanda" and "SCI Yamuna" which are currently in position in the South Pacific near Fiji.
Mission profile.
Launch.
As originally conceived, ISRO would have launched MOM on its new Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), but the GSLV has failed twice in two space missions in 2010, ISRO is still sorting out issues with its cryogenic engine, and it was not advisable to wait for the new batch of rockets since that would have delayed the MOM project for at least three years. ISRO had to make a choice between delaying the Mars Orbiter Mission and switching to the less-powerful PSLV. They opted for the latter. There is no way to launch on a direct-to-Mars trajectory with the PSLV as it does not have the power. Instead, ISRO launched it into Earth orbit first and slowly boosted it into an interplanetary trajectory with the help of gravity assist manoeuvres.
On 19 October 2013, ISRO chairman K. Radhakrishnan announced that the launch had to be postponed by a week as a result of a delay of a crucial telemetry ship reaching Fiji Islands. The launch was rescheduled for 5 November 2013. ISRO's PSLV-XL placed the satellite in Earth orbit at 09:50 UTC, on 5 November 2013, with a perigee of 264.1 km, an apogee of 23,903.6 km, and inclination of 19.20 degrees, with both the antenna and all three sections of the solar panel arrays deployed. During the first three orbit raising operations, ISRO progressively tested the spacecraft systems.
The orbiter's dry mass is , and it carries of fuel and oxidiser. Its main engine, which is a derivative of the system used on India's communications satellites, uses the bipropellant combination monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from Earth. It will also be used to slow down the probe for Mars orbit insertion and subsequently, for orbit corrections.
Orbit raising manoeuvres.
Several orbit raising operations were conducted from the Spacecraft Control Centre (SCC) at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) at Peenya, Bangalore on 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 16 November by using the spacecraft's on-board propulsion system and Earth flybys for gravity assist. The aim was to gradually build up the necessary escape velocity (11.2 km/s) to break free from Earth's gravitational pull while minimising propellant use. The first three of the five planned orbit raising manoeuvres were completed with nominal results, while the fourth was partially successful. However, a subsequent supplementary manoeuvre raised the orbit to the intended altitude aimed for in the original fourth manoeuvre. A total of six burns were completed while the spacecraft remained in Earth orbit, with a seventh burn conducted on 30 November to insert MOM into a heliocentric orbit for its transit to Mars.
The first orbit-raising manoeuvre was performed on 6 November 2013 at 19:47 UTC when the liquid engine of the spacecraft was fired for 416 seconds. With this engine firing, the spacecraft's apogee was raised to 28,825 km, with a perigee of 252 km.
The second orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 7 November 2013 at 20:48 UTC, with a burn time of 570.6 seconds resulting in an apogee of 40,186 km.
The third orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 8 November 2013 at 20:40 UTC, with a burn time of 707 seconds resulting in an apogee of 71,636 km.
The fourth orbit raising manoeuvre, starting at 20:36 UTC on 10 November 2013, imparted an incremental velocity of 35 m/s to the spacecraft instead of the planned 135 m/s as a result of underburn by the motor. Because of this, the apogee was boosted to 78,276 km instead of the planned 100,000 km. When testing the redundancies built-in for the propulsion system, the flow to the liquid engine stopped, with consequent reduction in incremental velocity. During the fourth orbit burn, the primary and redundant coils of the solenoid flow control valve of 440 Newton liquid engine and logic for thrust augmentation by the attitude control thrusters were being tested. When both primary and redundant coils were energised together during the planned modes, the flow to the liquid engine stopped. Operating both the coils simultaneously is not possible for future operations, however they could be operated independently of each other, in sequence.
As a result of the fourth planned burn coming up short, an additional unscheduled burn was performed on 12 November 2013 that increased the apogee to 118,642 km, a slightly higher altitude than originally intended in the fourth manoeuvre. The apogee was raised to 192,874 km on 15 November 2013, 19:57 UTC in the final orbit raising manoeuvre.
Trans-Mars injection.
On 30 November 2013 at 19:19 UTC, a 23-minute engine firing initiated the transfer of MOM away from Earth orbit and on heliocentric trajectory toward Mars. The probe is now travelling a distance of 780 million kilometres (484 million miles) to reach Mars.
Current status.
, the spacecraft has travelled 3-quarter of its total journey, approximately 510 million km.
Trajectory correction manoeuvres.
Four trajectory corrections are planned. The first was performed on 11 December 2013, the second was planned for April 2014 (conducted in June 2014); and the final two are planned for August 2014 and September 2014.
The first trajectory correction manoeuvre (TCM) was carried out on 11 December 2013, 01:00 UTC, by firing the thrusters for a duration of 40.5 seconds. As observed in April 2014, MOM is following the designed trajectory so closely that the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned in April 2014 is not considered essential.
The second Trajectory Correction Manoeuvre (TCM-2) of India's Mars Orbiter Spacecraft was successfully performed 11 June 2014, at 1630 hrs IST. TCM-2 was performed by firing the spacecraft’s 22 Newton thrusters for a duration of 16 seconds.
Mars orbit insertion.
The current plan is for insertion into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, approximately 2 days after the arrival of NASA's MAVEN orbiter. MOM will be set on a highly elliptical orbit around Mars, with a period of 76.7 hours and a planned periapsis of and apoapsis of .

Yamaha bravo

The Yamaha Bravo was a snowmobile manufactured by Yamaha Motor Company for 30 years, from 1982 to 2012. Declining sales and a movement to faster and cleaner machines persuaded Yamaha to stop producing the snowmobile after the 2012 model.
History.
It was first launched in 1982 with a 249cc single cylinder two-stroke engine powering a 98 inch(length)x 15 inch(width)x .75 inch (paddle). 
In 1987 there came an option to replace the 98 inch long track with a 136 inch long track or with a 102 inch track. This track allowed the Bravo to float on the snow extremely well and appealed much to trappers and beginners on the sled. The Short track versions of the Bravo would do around 70 km/h and the long track would do around 55 km/h. Later Yamaha swapped the 249cc engine for a 246cc engine but little else changed and almost all parts were interchangeable. 
In the late 1990s Yamaha removed both short track models from the market and only the 136 inch track was available. Yamaha Bravo was an extremely reliable sled and could go 20,000 or more km trouble free. The short tracked model of the Bravo weighed about 380 lbs and the long track version weighed just over 400 lbs.
The Yamaha Bravo was particularly popular in remote villages in the Arctic, particularly Nunavut, as they are known to be tough and reliable, and require little maintenance.

Battle of Reval (1602)

The Battle of Reval took place on June 30, 1602, during the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1611) near present day Tallinn in Estonia.
The Polish forces were led by Grand Field Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski who had been sent against Swedish forces gathering by Tallinn by Grand Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski. Żółkiewski attacked "on the march" with two squadrons of Polish hussars. The charge however was not successful. As a result the Swedish forces put up frisian horses as a protection against further frontal cavalry charges. Żółkiewski then sent light cavalry on a round about flanking maneuver which attacked the Swedes from behind, coinciding with another charge by the hussars. The Swedish lines broke as a result. The Swedes were led by Reinhold Arnep.

<doc id="36628157" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36628157" title="Liver injury">
Liver injury

A liver injury is some form of trauma sustained to the liver. This can occur through either a blunt force such as a car accident, or a penetrating foreign object such as a knife. Liver injuries constitute 5% of all traumas, making it the most common abdominal injury. Generally nonoperative management and observation is all that is required for a full recovery.
Cause.
Given its anterior position in the body and its large size, is it prone to gun shot wounds and stab wounds. Its firm location under the diaphragm also makes it especially prone to shearing forces. Common causes of this type of injury are blunt force mechanisms such as motor vehicle accidents, falls, and sports injuries. Typically these blunt forces dissipate through and around the structure of the liver. A large majority of people who sustain this injury also have another accompanying injury.
Diagnosis.
Imaging, such as the use of ultrasound or a computed tomography scan, is the generally preferred way of diagnosis as it is more accurate and is sensitive to bleeding, however; due to logistics this is not always possible. For a person who is hemodynamically unstable a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) scan may take place which is used to find free floating fluid in the right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant of the abdomen. A physical examination may be used but is typically inaccurate in blunt trauma, unlike in penetrating trauma where the trajectory the projectile took can be followed digitally. A diagnostic peritoneal lavage may also be utilized but has limited application as it is hard to determine the origin of the bleeding.
Classification.
Liver injuries are classified on a Roman numeral scale with I being the least severe, to VI being the most severe. Generally any injury ≥III requires surgery.
Management.
The initial management of liver trauma generally follows the same procedures for all traumas with a focus on maintaining airway, breathing, and circulation. A physical examination is a corner stone of the assessment of which there are various non-invasive means of diagnostic tools that can be utilized. An invasive diagnostic peritoneal lavage can also be used to diagnose and classify the extent of the damage. A large majority of liver injuries are minor and require only observation. Generally if there is estimated to be less than 300mL of free floating fluid, no injury to surrounding organs, and no need for blood transfusion, there is a low risk of complication from nonoperative management. In special cases where there is a higher risk with surgery, such as in the elderly, nonoperative management would include the infusion of packed red blood cells in an intensive care unit. Typically hepatic injuries resulting from stab wounds cause little damage unless a vital part of the liver is injured such as the hepatic portal vein, with gunshot wounds, the damage is worse.
Surgery.
In severe liver injuries (class ≥III), surgical correction is generally necessary. In these severe injuries a hepatopancreatobiliary surgeon may be utilized rather than a trauma surgeon given their expertise with the organ and generally yields better outcomes. Surgical techniques such as perihepatic packing or the use of the Pringle manoeuvre can be used to control hemorrhage. Temporary control of the hemorrhage can be direct manual pressure to the wound site. In these severe cases it is important to prevent the progression of the trauma triad of death, which often requires the utilization of damage control surgery. The common cause of death while operating is exsanguination caused by profuse loss of blood volume. Rarely, surgery entails the use of liver resection, which removes the source of the bleeding and necrotic tissue. The drastic nature of this procedure means it can only be used in hemodynamically stable patients. Another rare procedure would be liver transplantation which is typically impractical due to the logistics of finding a proper organ donor in a timely fashion.
History.
In the 1880s a severe liver injury would in most cases prove fatal in the first 24 hours after sustaining the injury. Before the 1980s nonoperative management was seldom used in favor of the methods of management suggested by James Hogarth Pringle. During World War II the use of early laparotomy was popularized and in conjunction with the use of transfusions, advanced anesthetics, and other new surgical techniques led to decreased mortality.

Armenian Genocide in culture

Armenian Genocide in culture represents the ways in which people have represented the Armenian Genocide of 1915 in culture, including in art, literature, music and films.
There have also been numerous memorials of the genocide around the world.
Art.
The earliest example of the Armenian genocide on art was a medal issued in St. Petersburg, signifying Russian sympathy for Armenian suffering. It was struck in 1915, as the massacres and deportations were still raging. Since then, dozens of medals in different countries have been commissioned to commemorate the event.
The paintings of Armenian-American Arshile Gorky, a seminal figure of Abstract Expressionism, are considered to have been informed by the suffering and loss of the period. In 1915, at age 10, Gorky fled his native Van and escaped to Russian-Armenia with his mother and three sisters, only to have his mother die of starvation in Yerevan in 1919. His two "The Artist and His Mother" paintings are based on a photograph with his mother taken in Van.
Literature.
Several eyewitness accounts of the events were published, notably those of Swedish missionary Alma Johansson and U.S. Ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. German medic Armin Wegner wrote several books about the events he witnessed while stationed in the Ottoman Empire. Years later, having returned to Germany, Wegner was imprisoned for opposing Nazism, and his books were burnt by the Nazis. Probably the best known literary work on the Armenian Genocide is Franz Werfel's 1933 "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh". It was a bestseller that became particularly popular among the youth of the Jewish ghettos during the Nazi era. Armenian American writer William Saroyan emphasized the Armenians' ability to survive in his 1935 short story The Armenian and the Armenian.
Kurt Vonnegut's 1988 novel "Bluebeard" features the Armenian Genocide as an underlying theme. Other novels incorporating the Armenian Genocide include Louis de Berniéres' "Birds without Wings", Edgar Hilsenrath's German-language "The Story of the Last Thought", and Polish Stefan Żeromski's 1925 "The Spring to Come". A story in Edward Saint-Ivan's 2006 anthology "The Black Knight's God" includes a fictional survivor of the Armenian Genocide.
Film.
The first film about the Armenian Genocide appeared in 1919, a Hollywood production titled "Ravished Armenia". It resonated with acclaimed director Atom Egoyan, influencing his 2002 "Ararat". There are also references in Elia Kazan's "America, America" and Henri Verneuil's "Mayrig". At the Berlin Film Festival of 2007 Italian directors Paolo and Vittorio Taviani presented another film about the events, based on Antonia Arslan's book, "La Masseria Delle Allodole" ("The Farm of the Larks"). Richard Kalinoski's play, "Beast on the Moon", is about two Armenian Genocide survivors. Anoush Baghdassarian's play, "FOUND," is a historical fiction play about a woman's experience through the Armenian Genocide. It follows the story of a girl named Lucine who is searching for her brother who was taken by Turkish soldiers in 1915 at the start of the genocide. The stage is split in half and while "Old Lucine (1925)" on stage right writes in her diary of memories of the past ten years, "Young Lucine (1915)" acts them out on stage left. It has been performed in New York (2013) and California (2014). 
Music.
Here is a list of musical works dedicated to the Armenian Genocide and related events:
The American band System of a Down, composed of four descendants of Armenian Genocide survivors, has promoted awareness of the Armenian Genocide through its lyrics, including P.L.U.C.K. and in concerts.
In late 2003, Diamanda Galás released the album "Defixiones, Will and Testament: Orders from the Dead", an 80-minute memorial tribute to the Armenian, Assyrian and Greek victims of the genocide in Turkey. "The performance is an angry meditation on genocide and the politically cooperative denial of it, in particular the Turkish and American denial of the Armenian, Assyrian, and Anatolian Greek genocides from 1914 to 1923".

Taiwan Railway EMU100 series

The Taiwan Railway EMU100 series is a set of rail cars fabricated by the British General Electric Company (GEC) in 1976 that operated in Taiwan. The alternating current electric multiple unit (EMU) fleet entered full squadron service in 1979. This class of railcars were the first to operate on the electric "Tzu-Chiang Express". Due to the unit's British origin, rail buffs have variously nicknamed them "British Girl", "British Lady", or "British Grandma".
Background.
In the early 1970s, the West Coast Mainline Electrification Scheme was already planned. Taiwan Railways had ordered 94 electric locomotives, and also 13 sets of five-car electric multiple units (total 65 vehicles) from England's General Electric Company (GEC), manufactured by Union Carriage & Wagon of South Africa. Identified as the Taiwan Railways EMU100 series, the set included driving power coach 50EP100, motor coach 55EM100, two trailers 40ET100, and driving trailer 40ED100.
GEC and Union Carriage & Wagon were awarded the design-build contract, and the sets were assembled at York in 1976. Throughout 1978 the sets were delivered to Taiwan for testing and acceptance.
Although full service was inaugurated on 15 August 1978, within a month the EMU100 units had been temporarily sidelined due to air conditioning trouble and various component issues. The 50-ton motor power coach (50EP100), which contained the 25kV AC main transformer, was too heavy and caused bogie suspension stress issues, and was a safety concern when operating at high speeds. After four month of intensive troubleshooting involving TRA Mechanical section and the original equipment manufacturers, the vehicles were re-launched on 2 January 1979 in revenue passenger service. It was not until 1 July 1979, when the West Coast Mainline Electrification Project had reached substantial completion throughout its entire project length, had Tzu-Chiang been able to reach its full potential of operating at 120 km/h. Taking 4 hours and 10 minutes between Taipei and Kaohsiung, the EMU100 broke prior service speed records set by the "White Steel Train" DR2700 diesel multiple unit operating as the Kuang-Hwa Express, and became TRA's newest-generation premier express.
After 30 years of service, the EMU100 series was withdrawn from regular commercial service in 2009. It has been used on special occasions since.

Philip H. Cooper

Rear Admiral Philip Henry Cooper (5 August 1844 - 29 December 1912) was an officer in the United States Navy. He fought in the American Civil War and served as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy and as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet.
Naval career.
Cooper was born in Camden, New York, on 5 August 1844, the son of Hiram H. and Delia A. Cooper. He was appointed as an acting midshipman from New York's 20th congressional district on 28 September 1860 and entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, as a member of the class of 1864; the Academy moved to Newport, Rhode Island, after the American Civil War broke out in April 1861. On 16 July 1862, the rank of acting midshipman was abolished, and Coopers rank changed to midshipman. On 21 November 1862, Cooper, Henry Glass, and Charles McGregor were appointed acting assistant professors of mathematics at the Naval Academy while all three were still Academy students. Cooper was commissioned as an acting ensign on 28 May 1863 and was assigned to the sloop-of-war , serving as an Academy training ship, the same day.
Due to the wartime requirement for officers in the rapidly expanding fleet, Cooper – ranked fifth in his graduating class – was detached early from the Naval Academy on 1 October 1863 and assigned to the steam sloop-of-war in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in the Gulf of Mexico for the rest of the Civil War. Aboard "Richmond", he saw action in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America and in the Battle of Mobile Bay on 5 August 1864.
After the conclusion of the Civil War, Cooper was assigned to the sidewheel steam frigate in the South Pacific Squadron on 28 July 1865. While aboard "Powhatan", he was promoted to master on 10 November 1865 and to lieutenant on 10 November 1866. On 31 December 1867 he was transferred to the staff of the U.S. Naval Academy, where he was assistant to the Commandant of Midshipmen and assistant instructor in seamanship and naval tactics and was promoted to lieutenant commander on 12 March 1868. He then returned to sea, being assigned to the sailing frigate on 30 April 1869 while she was serving as a training ship, and made a midshipman cruise to Europe and the Mediterranean aboard her. On 9 September 1870, he became a member of the Tehauntepec and Nicaragua Surveying Expedition.
On 31 May 1871, Cooper detached from the expedition and reported for duty at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, where he performed duty as equipment officer. He transferred to the screw sloop-of-war on 20 September 1871. Cooper next returned to duty on the staff of the Naval Academy, assigned there on 10 July 1872. On 19 July 1875, he was ordered to the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island, for torpedo instruction, then was transferred on 17 August 1875 to the Naval Experimental Battery at Annapolis, Maryland. An assignment as assistant hydrographic inspector in the United States Coast Survey office followed, beginning on 28 June 1878.
Cooper detached from the Coast Survey on 7 November 1878 to take up special duty in the Bureau of Navigation and was promoted to commander on 1 November 1879. He left the bureau on 7 March 1881 to become commanding officer of the screw gunboat while "Alliance" was under repair. He returned to the Bureau of Navigation on 1 October 1881 for a brief period of special duty before taking command of the screw sloop-of-war in the Asiatic Squadron on 17 October 1881. He left "Swatara" on 20 May 1884 and had duty at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, from 1 April 1886 until 1888. While there, he was appointed on 18 February 1887 as senior member of a board to survey all stores and materials at the navy yard. He served on several general courts-martial during 1889.
On 22 January 1890, Cooper was ordered back to "Swatara" for a second tour as her commanding officer, and he took command of her in March 1890. On 30 January 1891, he received orders to detach from "Swatara" on 7 February 1891. He then served on several courts martial and courts of inquiry during 1891 before being ordered on 18 November 1891 to special duty on the Board on Navy Yard Reorganization.
Coopers next duty was as a member of the Board of Inspection and Survey, to which he was assigned on 3 June 1892. While on the board, he served on several courts martial, oversaw the sea trials of the screw steamer , the armored cruiser , the protected cruisers , , and , and the gunboat , and was promoted to captain on 11 April 1894.
Leaving the board, Cooper received command of the protected cruiser on 18 July 1894. On 7 November 1894 he detached from "San Francisco" with orders to become Superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy, effective 15 November 1894. He remained superintendent until detached from the Academy on 5 July 1898.
On 7 July 1898, Cooper reported to the protected cruiser to oversee her fitting out after a lengthy overhaul, and he became her commanding officer when she was recommissioned on 1 December 1898. After detaching from "Chicago" on 5 October 1899, he took a leave of absence, then received orders on 5 May 1900 to report aboard the battleship as her commanding officer, effective 9 June 1900. He detached from "Iowa" on 5 March 1901 and awaited orders until his assignment on 7 October 1901 to serve on a court martial at Tutuila in the Tutuila Islands (later American Samoa).
Promoted to rear admiral on 9 February 1902, Cooper became the president of a general court martial at Port Royal, South Carolina, on 10 April 1902. In 1902 he was responsible for the defense of the United States East Coast from Barnegat, New Jersey, north to the border with Canada and in July 1902 took part in combined U.S. Navy-United States Army maneuvers with his headquarters at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and using the gunboat as his flagship.
Cooper reported for duty on 6 February 1903 as Senior Squadron Commander in the Asiatic Fleet. On 1 March 1903, he assumed command of the fleets Southern Squadron and on 2 July 1903 of its Cruiser Squadron. On 21 March 1904, he assumed command of the entire Asiatic Fleet. However, his health went into decline, and on 1 or 11 July 1904 (sources vary), Cooper detached from the Asiatic Fleet. On 5 August 1904, he retired from the Navy.
Personal life.
Coopers first wife was the former Addie Lou Paine. He married his second wife, Sarah Lawrence Stuart (1851-1881), on 3 October 1871. After she died, he married his third wife, Katherine J. Foote Saltus (1853-1937) on 24 June 1884. He fathered six children, Gerald Cooper (d. 1887), Geraldine Cooper (d. 1885), Stuart Cooper (1873-1924), Philip Benson Cooper (1877-1956), Dorothy Bradford Cooper Patterson (1889-1972), and Leslie B. Cooper (1894-1944); the latter became a nationally recognized helicopter expert and a United States Army Air Forces lieutenant colonel before dying in the crash of a U.S. Army Air Forces training plane in New Jersey in October 1944.
Death.
Cooper apparently contracted chronic malaria while in Nicaragua in 1870 and 1871 on the surveying expedition. Repeated bouts of malaria took a toll on his health, which became poor enough in 1904 to force him to relinquish command of the Asiatic Fleet and retire. He returned to the United States but never completely recovered, and died at Morristown, New Jersey, on 29 December 1912 of interstitial myocarditis and general arteriosclerosis.
Cooper is buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Morristown.

Mitral facies

Mitral facies refers to a distinctive facial appearance associated with mitral stenosis.
Someone with mitral stenosis may present with rosy cheeks, whilst the rest of the face has a bluish tinge due to cyanosis. This is especially so in severe mitral stenosis. It is due to low cardiac output, and therefore low perfusion of the facial skin, caused by the stenosis.

<doc id="36628323" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36628323" title="Magnitsky Act">
Magnitsky Act

The Magnitsky Act, formally known as the Russia and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012, is a bipartisan bill passed by the U.S. Congress and President Obama in November–December 2012, intending to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian lawyer Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009.
Background.
In 2009, Russian lawyer and auditor Sergei Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison after investigating fraud involving Russian tax officials.
Law.
In June 2012, the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed a law called the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (H.R. 4405). The main intention of the law was to punish Russian officials who were thought to be responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky by prohibiting their entrance to the United States and use of their banking system. The legislation was taken up by a Senate panel the next week, sponsored by Senator Ben Cardin, and cited in a broader review of the mounting tensions in the international relationship. 
In November 2012, provisions of the Magnitsky bill were attached to a House bill (H.R. 6156) normalizing trade with Russia (i.e. repealing the Jackson–Vanik amendment) and Moldova. On 6 December 2012 U.S. Senate passed the House version of the law. The law was signed by President Barack Obama on December 14, 2012.
Individuals affected.
The Obama administration made public a list of 18 individuals affected by the Act in April 2013. The people included on the list are:
Russian government reaction.
In response to adoption of the Magnitsky Act, Russian government denied Americans adoption of Russian children, issued a list of US officials prohibited from entering Russia, and posthumously convicted Magnitsky as guilty. In addition, the Russian government reportedly lobbied against the legislature acting through a public relations company led by Kenneth Duberstein.
Ban on U.S. adoption of Russian children.
On December 19, 2012, the State Duma voted 400 to 4 to ban the international adoption of Russian children into the United States. The bill was unofficially named after Dmitri Yakovlev (Chase Harrison), a Russian toddler who died in 2008 of heat stroke after neglect from his adoptive American father. Other recent developments include the introduction of a law to prevent US citizens from working with political NGOs in Russia and a law, recently abandoned, preventing any foreigner from speaking on state television if they discredited the state.
Banning some U.S. officials from Russia.
On April 13, 2013, Russia released a list naming 18 Americans banned from entering the Russian Federation over their alleged human rights violations, as a direct response to the Magnitsky list. The people banned from Russia are listed below:
US officials involved in legalizing torture and indefinite detention of prisoners (The Guantanamo List):
The Russian lawmakers also banned several U.S. officials involved in the prosecution and trial of Russian arms smuggler Viktor Bout and drug smuggler Konstantin Yaroshenko, both serving prison time in the United States:
Reception.
Australian expatriate jurist Geoffrey Robertson, who is representing some of the Magnitsky campaigners, has described the Act as "one of the most important new developments in human rights". He says it provides "a way of getting at the Auschwitz train drivers, the apparatchiks, the people who make a little bit of money from human rights abuses and generally keep under the radar."
State Duma deputy Yevgeny Fedorov argued that the real purpose of the Magnitsky bill was to manipulate key figures in big business and government, with the aim of pro-American policy in the Russian Federation.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs Directorate for Special Affairs in the U.K. stated that it is aware of those on the list. The U.K. bans travel of those on the list under existing legislation which prohibits entry for those implicated in cases of human rights violations.
The "World Socialist Web Site" condemned the United States for only invoking human rights as a cover for realpolitik, stating that Washington had supported "far greater crimes, as when Boris Yeltsin in 1993 ordered the bombardment of the Russian White House, the seat of the country’s parliament, killing over 1,000 people".

Helen Lee (director)

Helen Lee (; born circa 1965) is a Korean-Canadian film director. Born in Seoul, South Korea, she emigrated to Canada at the age of four and grew up in Scarborough, Ontario. Interested in film at a young age, she took film studies at the University of Toronto and, later, New York University. While in university she was influenced by gender and minority theories, as reflected in her first film, the short "Sally's Beauty Spot" (1990). While continuing her studies she produced two more films before taking a five-year hiatus to live in Korea beginning in 1995. After her return, she released another short film and her feature film debut, the critically panned "The Art of Woo" (2001). She continues to produce short films, although at a reduced rate. Lee's films often deal with gender and racial issues, reflecting the state of East Asians in modern society; a common theme in her work is sexuality, with several films featuring interracial relationships.
Early life.
Helen Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea, around 1965, but came to Canada when she was four, a year after her parents. She was raised in Scarborough, Ontario, having moved there in the mid-1970s. As a child, she became interested in black-and-white films from the Golden Age of Hollywood. She later wrote that the 1960 film "The World of Suzie Wong" spoke to her racial identity as an Asian Canadian, an experience she found to have influenced her filmmaking; excerpts from the film were included in her first short.
Lee began her tertiary studies at the University of Western Ontario, taking business, before transferring to the University of Toronto; there she majored in English literature and film studies. By 1989 she was attending New York University (NYU), studying under Homi K. Bhabha, Faye Ginsburg, and Mick Taussig, with a scholarship. During this period she was influenced by Trinh T. Minh-ha's paradigms on women and ethnicity, as expressed in the 1989 book "Woman, Native, Other: Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism"; these were later expressed in Lee's first film. She later described Minh-ha as at one point being her "ultimate role model".
Early film career.
Lee made "Sally's Beauty Spot", a 12-minute long short film focusing on a mole on her sister's right breast, for a film editing class at NYU in 1990. For the film she used a second-hand Bolex camera and edited it with a Steenbeck editing suite. She later recalled that she recorded the film while in her pyjamas. The production cost a total of $4,000. Fellow Canadian filmmaker David Weaver described it as sexualizing Sally's body, something that Lee had not intended. The film was first screened at the Festival of Festivals in Toronto. After graduation, Lee spent time as a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art before returning to Canada.
In 1992 Lee made the forty-minute long film "My Niagara", which featured scenes shot in Japan that were reminiscent of home movies; the effect was obtained by filming in Super 8 Kodachrome, then transferring it to 16 mm film. Filmed in Etobicoke, Ontario, at the childhood home of co-writer Kerri Sakamoto, the film detailed a young Asian-Canadian woman living alone with her father after the death of her mother. Scenes were also shot at the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant in Toronto. Fransisca Duran in "LIFT" writes that the film, which had a budget of $80,000, had a theme of cultural displacement, and Lee states that "My Niagara" was well received. That year she also released the three-minute "To Sir With Love".
After "My Niagara", Lee took a position as a director observer on the set of Atom Egoyan's "Exotica", while led her to enrol with the Canadian Film Centre (CFC). Meanwhile, she worked as a film and music critic for "Now" magazine and extensively wrote about films for other publications. She took further studies at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Banff, Alberta, before returning to the CFC as a director residency. She continued to be involved with the American company Women Make Movies, a distributor of feminist media, which she had become involved with while at NYU.
In 1995 Lee released the 26-minute long "Prey", starring Adam Beach and Sandra Oh; she described the film as a "cross-cultural comedy". The film, which followed a young Korean woman who falls in love with a drifter, was a collaboration with Cameron Bailey and dealt with themes of racial differences, immigration, and social class. The Canadian film critic and experimental filmmaker Mike Hoolboom compared the themes to those of the 1989 Hollywood film "Do the Right Thing", writing that had short films been respected it would have been a watershed mark. That year she also released the three-minute "M. Nourbese Philip". She then took a five-year hiatus, which she spent in Korea.
Post Korea.
In 2000 Lee released the 22-minute short "Subrosa", following a woman's search for her mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled "Priceless", the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as an organic understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although "Priceless", meant as a sequel to "Subrosa", went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.
Anita Lee, co-producer of "Priceless", then suggested that Helen Lee make "The Art of Woo", a romantic comedy sponsored by the Canadian Film Centre; it was Lee's feature film debut. Starring Adam Beach and Sook Yin Lee, the film followed a Korean-Canadian art dealer who finds herself interested in a native artist but considers him unworthy as he is poor. Released in 2001, the film was "slashed" by critics. For example, Jonathan Crow, writing for the Rovi Corporation, found the film "less fun and less accomplished than a third grade theater production". However, its soundtrack – by Ron Sexsmith and Kurt Swinghammer – won a Genie Award for "Best Achievement in Music – Original Song". That year she also released the three-minute "Star".
After "The Art of Woo", Lee announced that intended to adapt Kerri Sakamoto's novel "The Electrical Field" and a "romantic thriller". However, neither film has yet been released. In 2002 she showed the video installation "Cleaving" at the Werkleitz Biennale in Germany. She married around 2008, and that same year released the short "Hers at Last", about the interactions of two women in Korea. The short was premiered at the Seoul International Women's Film Festival as part of an omnibus entitled "Ten Ten", in celebration of the festival's tenth anniversary. The omnibus also featured works by fellow directors Byun Young-joo and Lee Su-yeon.
Themes.
Race, gender issues, and racial identity often feature in Lee's works. The main characters, up through "The Art of Woo", are Asian women that are "caught up in some cross cultural encounter". She writes that she attempts to address these issues through her films in non-didactic ways, such that the "racial melancholia ... are like seepages in the more obvious dramatic or comedic content". She contrasts her films with the 1993 drama "The Joy Luck Club", which she considers a film with obvious, easily consumable, ethnic content. She considers the stereotype of Asian women as seductresses, either demure "lotus blossoms" or vociferous "dragon ladies", to be a degenerative one which is "sometimes extremely offensive", but one that has "a cultural memory that demands viewer's attention."
Lee's works often include elements of sexuality in their characterizations. She writes that the main characters of "My Niagara" and "Subrosa" reach a greater understanding of themselves and their relationships after sexual encounters. She considers sex as "never the culmination or end point", but a signifier for intimacy. As such, she feels that the more intimate aspects of sex are best conveyed wordlessly, through how it is presented, although she concedes that "talky sex" can be appropriate for romantic comedies.

The Black Scholar

The Black Scholar (TBS), one of the "leading journals of black culture and political thought in the United States", was founded in 1969 by Robert Chrisman and Nathan Hare. 
Production.
Now in its 43rd year of publication, it is produced under the editorial direction of Editor-in-Chief Laura Chrisman along with Senior Editors Robert L. Allen, Louis Chude-Sokei, and Sundiata Cha-Jua, and Executive Editor Maize Woodford. The NAACP’s "Crisis" and the "Journal of Negro History" (now known as the "Journal of African American History") are the two black journals that have been publishing for a longer period of time. "TBS" is currently published quarterly by the Black World Foundation, an Oakland, California, non-profit educational organization, in association with Paradigm Publishers in Boulder, Colorado.
Original editorial board.
Robert Chrisman, Nathan Hare, and the late Alan Ross were active in the 1968 ideological battles at San Francisco State. As a consequence, Hare was fired and Chrisman was removed from tenure track as a professor. A year later, in November of 1969, Chrisman, Hare, and Ross founded "The Black Scholar: A Journal of Black Studies and Research". In addition to the founding members, some early members of the editorial board included Shirley Chisholm, Imamu Baraka, Angela Davis, Dempsey Travis, Max Roach, John Oliver Killens, Ossie Davis, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Ron Karenga, and Lerone Bennett.
Nathan Hare split.
Nathan Hare left "The Black Scholar" in 1975. In his open letter of resignation, Hare accused "TBS’" other board members of sabotaging his contribution in order to further a black Marxist agenda. He pinpointed the shift as occurring after Robert Chrisman and Robert Allen went to Cuba in 1973. Thereafter, he asserted, the journal was less inclined to publish black cultural nationalists. Hare’s resignation led to a resignation from Charles Hamilton. The remaining members denied Hare's allegations, calling them “red-baiting and smearing.” 
The controversial split garnered a range of public reactions. "The New York Times" covered the story in an article titled "Ideology Dispute Shakes Black Journal" while the "New York Amsterdam News" headline read "Black Reds Take Over Black Scholar!"
Notable issues.
A special issue of "The Black Scholar" titled “The Black Sexism Debate” (Vol. 10, No. 8/9, May/June 1979)—one of the first public scholarly forums about sexism within the African American community—attracted a lot of controversy due to the contradictory positions on gender equality it presented. The issue featured responses from feminists, intellectuals, and artists to Robert Staples’ controversial essay “The Myth of the Black Macho: A Response to Angry Black Feminists,” which had been published in the previous issue of "TBS" and criticizes Michele Wallace's and Ntozake Shange's work. The editors of the journal viewed the issue as a means of clarifying the relationship between black men and women while also forging solidarities among them. 
Over a decade later, when millions of people were fascinated by Clarence Thomas’ confirmation to the Supreme Court, "TBS" compiled a special issue in which scholars and historians weighed in on the issues of sexism and racism in the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill controversy (Vol. 22, No. 1/2, Winter 1991-Spring 1992). The essays were later published as "Court of Appeal: The Black Community Speaks Out on the Racial and Sexual Politics of Thomas vs. Hill", in 1992. 
More recently, two special editions on Barack Obama’s impact on race relations in America (Vol. 38, No. 1 (Spring 2008) and Vol. 38, No. 4 (Winter 2008)) were later published in 2011 as a book anthology titled "The Obama Phenomenon: Toward a Multiracial Democracy". In the anthology, scholars from an array of fields, including political science, sociology, theology, journalism, and law, critically analyze Obama’s relationship with the media, race relations during presidential campaigns of the 1960s, the American public’s perception of first lady Michelle Obama, and the broader social implications of America’s first black president.
"TBS" has also explored black American issues through engagements with questions of black transnational solidarity. Perhaps most notably, "TBS" published a special issue on Cuba in 1977 featuring essays from artists, activists, and intellectuals alike which focused on their impressions of the revolutionary society after visiting the island through the initiative of the journal’s board.
Notable contributors.
"The Black Scholar" was founded with the principle that all black authors, scholars and activists could take part in dialogues within its pages. It has retained its non-discriminatory policy of publishing intellectuals from a variety of professions outside of academia. For example "TBS" has featured US Congress representatives Shirley Chisholm, Ron Dellums, Barbara Lee, and activists such as Julian Bond, Herb Boyd, Amílcar Cabral, Eldridge Cleaver, Nawal El Saadawi, Cheddi Jagan, Julius Nyerere, Bobby Seale, and Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael).
Additionally, "TBS" has been dedicated to finding and developing new talent while also continuing to publish established authors. Creative writers that include Opal Palmer Adisa, Margaret Walker Alexander, Amiri Baraka, Dennis Brutus, Frank M. Chipasula, Wanda Coleman, Jayne Cortez, René Depestre, Ernest J. Gaines, Nicolás Guillén, June Jordan, Jackie Kay, Yusef Komunyakaa, Audre Lorde, Nancy Morejón, Agostinho Neto, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, May Opitz, Ishmael Reed, Andrew Salkey, Sonia Sanchez, Ntozake Shange, Wole Soyinka and Alice Walker have been published in issues of "TBS" over the years.
The journal has also been noted for featuring a wide range of black scholarly talent including Derrick Bell, Horace Campbell, Clayborne Carson, Elizabeth Catlett, John Henrik Clarke, Darlene Clark Hine, Johnnetta B. Cole, Carolyn Cooper, St. Clair Drake, Katherine Dunham, E. Chukwudi Eze, Kevin Gaines, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Lewis R. Gordon, Farah Jasmine Griffin, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, Patricia Hill Collins, Joy James, Peniel Joseph, Kara Keeling, Robin D. G. Kelley, Julianne Malveaux, Manning Marable, J. Lorand Matory, Adolph Reed, Barbara Smith, Hortense Spillers, Catherine Squires, Chuck Stone, and Ronald Walters. Furthermore, "TBS" has been recognized for its timely and significant interviews, such as the now famous dialogs with Muhammed Ali, Maya Angelou, Arthur Ashe, James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, Alex Haley, Darcus Howe, C. L. R. James, Jacob Lawrence, Queen Mother Audley Moore, Jack O’Dell, Max Roach, Walter Rodney, McCoy Tyner, and Robert F. Williams. 
The journal has featured famous essays from activists and academics alike. Angela Davis’s now canonized essay "Reflections on the Black Woman's Role in the Community of Slaves,” written while she was still in prison, was first published in "TBS" in 1971, Vol. 3, No. 4. She was still in prison on murder and kidnapping charges linked to George Jackson’s attempted escape from the Marin County Hall of Justice when the article was printed. "TBS"’ archives at UC Berkeley also house the last published writing by George Jackson while he was alive (Vol. 2, No. 10, June 1971), which was printed just two months before his fatal attempt to escape incarceration.
Activist involvement.
Activism has always been a founding premise of "The Black Scholar". As a result of student and faculty agitation and strikes in the late 1960s, a Black Studies department was inaugurated at San Francisco State University. Robert Chrisman and Nathan Hare, along with other African American faculty, were a part of the advisory board created to hire faculty for the new department. As activists in the Civil Rights Movement and the student movements of the 1960s, the founders of "TBS" used the journal not only as a publication informed by community activism but also as a hub for further activist work that addresses social inequality based on race, class, and gender in the United States and abroad. 
Many of "TBS"’ contributing and advisory editors have been involved with social and political activism such as organizing a political prisoners' fund, protests against the Vietnam War, trips to Cuba in the 1970s, a trip to the Eastern Bloc in 1985, and a speaker’s bureau to arrange speaking engagements for diverse thinkers of varying disciplines and experiences in and outside traditional academia. Founder Robert Chrisman represented "TBS" at a conference held in Havana, Cuba where a large American delegation met with Angolan leaders Commandante Dibalo, Ogla Lima, and Pedro Zinga Baptista to become informed of the Angolan people’s plight. A few months later Chrisman represented "TBS" at the Angola Support Conference, which opposed U.S. and South African intervention in Angola. 
The published works produced by "TBS"’ editors have also promoted activism by spreading awareness of racial injustices. As a result of Robert Allen’s publication "The Port Chicago Mutiny", which shed light on the unjust and unsafe working conditions that black Navy servicemen sustained during wartime efforts, social activists were inspired to rectify the injustices of the events. The surviving service were honored by a group of California State Assemblymen in 1998, over 50 years after these men were charged with mutiny for refusing to work under unsafe conditions. One of the men involved also received an official pardon by President Bill Clinton.
Robert Chrisman’s retirement.
On June 30, 2012, founding editor Robert Chrisman officially retired from his long-standing position as Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of "The Black Scholar". He publicly announced his retirement in a letter published on the back page of the Spring 2012 issue of "TBS". Chrisman claims that through the creation and the dissemination of such materials "TBS" has been able to “establish a foundation and platform for late 20th-century black criticism and scholarship." 
Also in the letter, Chrisman announces his daughter Laura Chrisman, professor of African, Black Atlantic and African Diaspora Studies in the English Department at the University of Washington, as his successor. In his letter, Chrisman makes reference to the transitioning direction and goals of the journal under the vision of Editor-in-Chief Laura Chrisman, Senior Editors Robert Allen, Louis Chude-Sokei, and Sundiata Cha-Jua, and Executive Editor Maize Woodford, in light of changes in the field of Black Studies and the intellectual interests of scholars and activists within it.
He ends his letter thanking those who have provided support throughout his tenure, including his executive assistant Jacki Frommé, typographer Rick Giezentaner, Pat Scott, and Conyus Calhoun. Since retiring, Robert Chrisman has completed his third volume of poems, "The Dirty Wars", published summer 2012 by Black Scholar Press. He continues to work on another volume of poetry entitled "Minotaur" and to work with Robert Allen on "The Black Scholar" archive at UC Berkeley.
Black Scholar Press.
Black Scholar Press is run out of San Francisco, California. It has published books since the 1970s, mostly regarding social science or poetry. Notable titles include: 
Anthologies.
The editors of "The Black Scholar" have published anthologies of notable articles from the journal, including:
Archive.
"The Black Scholar" archive was endowed to the African American Writers Collection at UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library, which is “one of the largest and most heavily used libraries of manuscripts, rare books, and unique materials in the United States,” as a means of furthering education on African-American history and social issues for future generations. 
“Launched in 1978, The Bancroft Library’s African American Writers Collection contains thousands of books, manuscripts, correspondence, photographs, and other rare works by African American authors,” ranging in date from the 1790s to contemporary society. Along with "TBS"’s extensive archive, the African American Writers Collection also houses the NAACP Archival Project and the Records of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.

Personal life.
Moffitt was born August 7, 1992 in Grimes, Iowa.
Career.
Moffitt began his racing career at the age of 10 in kart racing competition. In 2007, Moffitt won the Harris Clash in the IMCA Sport Modified division. Following several years of competition in karts and dirt track racing, Moffitt began competing on asphalt in 2008, driving in the American Speed Association's Late Model North Series. He made his debut in NASCAR touring series competition in 2009, driving in the K&N Pro Series East – then known as the Camping World East Series – for a team owned by Andy Santerre; winning the pole in his first race, at Greenville-Pickens Speedway, he became the youngest driver ever to do so in the series. He went on to score two wins over the course of the season, finishing the year third in series points. His first win, in the fourth race of the season at South Boston Speedway in May, made Moffitt the youngest driver ever to win in the series, and the youngest to win in any NASCAR touring series; the mark stood until the following season, when it was eclipsed by Darrell Wallace, Jr. in March 2010.
For the 2010 season, Moffitt moved to Joe Gibbs Racing; he scored two wins during the year on his way to finishing second in points at the end of the season. In 2011, he drove as a development driver for Michael Waltrip Racing, winning three times over the course of the K&N Pro Series East season and finishing third in the series standings.
For 2012, Moffitt changed teams again, moving to Hattori Racing Enterprises, owned by former IndyCar and Truck Series driver Shigeaki Hattori. He won races at Richmond International Raceway and Central Pennsylvania Speedway, and led the series points after nine events of the fourteen-race season. A lack of sponsorship funding from HRE meant that for the final races of the season, starting at New Hampshire, the team associated with Michael Walrip Racing to field Moffitt's car.
In August 2012, Moffitt made his debut in the NASCAR Nationwide Series, driving for RAB Racing at Iowa Speedway in the U.S. Cellular 250. He finished ninth in the event.
Moffit also is employed as a test driver for Michael Waltrip Racing. Moffitt made his Sprint Cup Series debut with the MWR-affiliated NEMCO-Jay Robinson Racing in the 2014 FedEx 400.

<doc id="36628413" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36628413" title="Taiwan Railway DR2700 series">
Taiwan Railway DR2700 series

The DR2700 series, also locally affectionately known as the "White Steel Train", is a series of diesel multiple unit train used by the Taiwan Railways Administration. They were originally built by Tokyu Car of Japan in 1966, in response to an order by the Taiwan Railways Administration, because of the need to renew the rolling stock on the by then 10-years-old "Flying Formosan" Express service. The total number of power cars built was 25, along with 6 trailers, and they usually worked in a formation of 2 power cars, or two power cars with one trailer in the middle, since the power cars were the only ones equipped with driving cabs, and given the modest output of the engine, it was not possible for just the one power car to haul another trailer alone.
History.
The DR2700 started public service on 31 October 1966, under the name of "The Glory of China" Express, and with its light body and a blazing 69 mph design speed, it still holds the pre-electrification record for the fastest time for traversing Taiwan's Western Line in its entirety, in a time of just four hours and 40 minutes, beating the previous "Flying Formosan" record by 20 minutes. It was way more comfortable and much quicker than the steam services, which were the best available a mere ten years ago in 1956.
The innovations introduced on this service included complementary refreshments and boxed lunches on the train, included free with the rail ticket. The service proved very popular with the rail users of the time, and indeed started a 'travelling by rail' culture in the Taiwan which lingers on today.
Perhaps rather bizarrely, this batch of train were bought by the government at a time when national resources were being stretched to the limit as the Taiwan recover from the Civil War following the end to the World War. The reason behind the order may have been as part of the publicity stunt for the 80th birthday celebration of Chiang Kai-Shek, a leading Chinese military leader, and eventually the president of the Mandarin government in the Formosa. The shining silver carriages were built with stainless steel, giving the nickname 'Baitee-ah', meaning "White Steel Train" in the local language, and until today they are still known by that name to some of the most senior employees of the Taiwan Railway Administration. However, as it turned out, even after consideration of the gross national product of the time, they were still very much a worthwhile investment for the railway infrastructure. By 1996, the DR2700 had given the locals 30 years of impeccable service, a length of time only exceeded by few DMUs, and was still going strong in 1997, relatively speaking, when compared to the availability of the other fleets of a similar age in the Formosa. As a result, it acquired another nickname ~ 'The forever white steel train'.
Since the electrification of the Western Line in the Taiwan, the units were cascaded to work the northern section of the Eastern Line, the southern section of which, in 1979, was still under construction. They were eventually stripped of their express status in 1986, after 20 years of meritious service. Failures were becoming commonplace due to their age, and they were considered no longer suitable for long distance services. The units are now used on branch lines in place of the DR2400 in order to provide a higher quality service. Before the arrival of the EMU400 and EMU500, they operated as peak-hour relief commuter services on the central coastal railway, under the branding of Diesel Express, which was timed slightly faster than the standard commuter service, and offered free seat reservations. One of the first branch lines to receive the DR2700 after they were cascaded by the EMU400 was the Neiwan Line, the longest branch line in the Taiwan, extending some 7 miles inland from Hsinchu, but their branch career did not really start until 1997 when the EMU500 class commuter trains were phased in throughout the country.
The small fleet of six DR2750 trailers had been withdrawn in 1997, following the introduction of the EMU500, in order to reduce the strain on the aged motor coaches. This is perhaps not the most sensible move at a time when there is a shortage of hauled mainline rolling stock, however, it is suspected that these trailers would never be cut up -as with most withdrawn units in the Formosa- they will be sent back to Tang Eng Iron Works for conversion into 'new' rolling stock, an analogous move to the British Rail Networker Classic conversions.
Today some DR2700 vehicles have been converted to catenary maintenance vehicles and are still in use by TRA in work service.

The strait flows between the Gavlfjorden/Sortlandssundet in the southwest and the Andfjorden in the northeast. The northeastern end of the strait is naturally very shallow and in low tide the sand bars can be above water. In the 1870s work began to dredge a channel through the strait to allow larger boats to pass. In 1922 a long channel was completed enabling the Hurtigruten to pass through the strait.

Return (1985 film)

Return, also Return: A Case of Passion, is a 1985 independent mystery film, written, directed and co-produced by Andrew Silver. It was Silver's debut theatrical work.
Synopsis.
Diana Stoving, after experiencing a premonition, becomes convinced that her mother withheld the truth about her family history. Diana travels to Massachusetts to investigate. She coincidentally meets a woman studying past-life regression; one of her subjects is Day Whittaker, a young man who seems to be possessed by the spirit of Diana's deceased grandfather. Under regression, Day claims he died under suspicious circumstances.
Production.
"Return" was based on the 1972 novel "Some Other Place. The Right Place." by Donald Harington. The film was shot in Los Angeles and Massachusetts, and was released in theaters January 24, 1986. It was released on VHS in 1988, with an "R" rating.
Reception.
Reviews varied from mildly to strongly negative. Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" found it to be a "technically competent but completely witless mystery movie about possession and reincarnation." He continued that the film is "always in focus, full of picturesque landscapes, devoid of character and even of suspense." "Boston Globe" reviewer Michael Blowen wrote "Fans of Shirley MacLaine's New Age fascination with past lives should find "Return", a locally produced feature film, entertaining ... This independent film has first-rate production values and excellent performances, but it lacks the necessary tension and suspense to propel it into the rank of first-rate occult movies." 
"Variety" noted that the subtitle ("A case of passion") "gave away" the romantic subplot, and the ending. The film received a cool reception at eFilmCritic; Charles Tatum described it as generating "a complete feeling of indifference", spending too little time on either "character development or suspense." He described the "twist" ending as obvious. Eleanor Mannikka (Rovi/AllMovie) wrote that "the theme veers from possession to suspense thriller, slowing up in the process...", giving the film two stars (of five).
Awards.
John Walcutt won Best Actor ("Caixa de Catalunya") at Sitges:Catalonian International Film Festival.

Artelius

Story.
An advanced civilization once flourished in a fictional solar system. One day, a black hole appeared and sucked everyone who lived there into another dimension. This parallel universe came to be known as "Artelius". Ruled by the diabolical king Sarbelor, he controls a machine that has split the universe into spaces filled with asteroid belts.
A cyborg has been built by a scientist named Dr. Rado in order to defeat Sarbelor; only he has been entrusted with this mission to save Artelius from the evil king's reign.
Gameplay.
Players begin the game by customizing and modifying the traits of their character. Warp points allow players to travel across the universe. On the map, the red dots are always bad guys while the blue dots indicate space colonies, where players can rest and stock up on supplies. Each resting spot has at least two doors and/or a warp point. Battles are done randomly and from a first-person perspective. Winning will earn the player valuable experience points that will make the player stronger and advance in levels.
The players attacks are determined by strength while their defensive power is determined by the strength of the shield. Having a high level of agility allows for more frequent successes in running away from unwanted battles. The laser beam is the best weapon in the game; it can be eventually be upgraded to a "hyper magnum" gun that is stronger than a fully powered up missile or bazooka weapon.

Research Experiences for Teachers

Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) program designed to improve science educators by exposing them to research. The program is closely modeled after the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. Several NSF directorates have their own RET programs including the Directorate of Biological Sciences (BIO), the Directorate for Engineering (ENG), and the Directorate of Computer Information Science and Engineering (CISE). The later two form a joint RET program. Like many NSF programs, the RET program especially encourages the participation of educators from underrepresented groups. In addition, the NSF encourages potential RET host sites to seek out teachers from impoverished school districts.
Directorate of Biological Sciences (BIO) RET Program.
The NSF BIO RET program is designed to increase the knowledge of K-12 science educators. One major objective of the BIO RET program is to encourage participants to incorporate their research skills into their class structures. The BIO RET program is intended to support up to two teachers per host site at any given time.
Directorates of Engineering and Computer Information Science and Engineering (ENG/CISE) RET Program.
The NSF ENG/CISE RET program is designed to increase the general knowledge and research skills of science educators. However, unlike the BIO RET program, the ENG/CISE RET program will support community college professors in addition to K-12 educators. Also, in contrast to the BIO RET program, the ENG/CISE RET program encourages host institutions to recruit no less than two teachers at a given time.<ref name="ENG/CISE RET" /> Funding for any RET host institution may not exceed $500,000 over three years and may not exceed $10,000 per teacher.<ref name="ENG/CISE RET" /> In accordance the NSF's concern for ethics, $4,000 per year may be granted to support ethics training.<ref name="ENG/CISE RET" /> The ENG/CISE allocated $5,500,000 for the fiscal year 2011 to support RETs.<ref name="ENG/CISE RET" /> 
Participating educators are provided with a stipend and may be reimbursed for travel and living expenses.<ref name="ENG/CISE RET" />

Mike Capel

Michael Lee Capel (born October 13, 1961) is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) right-handed pitcher who played for the Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, and Houston Astros. In 49 career games, Capel pitched 62.1 innings, struck out 43 batters, and had a career win–loss record of 3–4 with a 4.62 earned run average (ERA). While he played in MLB, Capel stood at and weighed . A starting pitcher in college and parts of his minor league baseball career, he converted to relief pitching while in Chicago's minor league system.
The Philadelphia Phillies chose Capel in the 24th round of the 1980 MLB Draft, but instead of signing a professional contract, he opted to attend the University of Texas. Capel played on the 1982 USA College All-Star Team, which competed in the Amateur World Series in Seoul and placed third. The next year, Capel and the Texas Longhorns won the College World Series. After he was drafted by the Cubs, Capel left Texas and signed to play professional baseball. He spent six seasons playing minor league baseball before making his MLB debut in 1988. Capel played the entire 1989 season in Triple-A, one level below the majors, but the Cubs released him at the end of the year. He agreed to terms with the Brewers and played in MLB after an injury opened a spot on Milwaukee's roster, but was again released at the end of the season. The Astros then signed Capel; he played in 25 games for Houston, the most of any MLB team Capel played for. He spent the final part of his career in the Astros farm system, and after making the 1992 Triple-A All-Star team, played his last season in 1993. After retirement, Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston, Texas.
Early life.
Capel was born on October 13, 1961, in Marshall, Texas, and attended Spring High School in Harris County. As a child, he enjoyed watching the Astros play on weekends. During his senior year in 1979, the Spring Lions won the AAAA conference state championship, and Capel was named to the All-State team, composed of the best high school players in the state. He set several pitching records at Spring High School. Future teammate Calvin Schiraldi called Capel a "hard thrower when he came out of high school" and "the top guy out of the state in 1980"; Roger Clemens said he was "probably the best pitcher in the state at that time". The Philadelphia Phillies drafted Capel with the 605th overall pick in the 1980 MLB Draft, but instead of signing with the Phillies, he chose to attend the University of Texas.
Collegiate career.
Capel enrolled at the University of Texas in 1981, but did not play baseball, as stretched ligaments in his elbow forced him to miss his freshman season. Capel pitched sidearmed for the remainder of his collegiate career to compensate for a loss in the velocity of his fastball. In 1982, he was named to the All-Southwest Conference team and pitched to a 9–0 win–loss record with a 3.68 ERA, as the Longhorns finished 59–6. His 1982 winning percentage of 1.000 ties him with 10 others for the best single-season winning percentage in Longhorns history (with a minimum of nine decisions). At the 1982 College World Series, Texas defeated the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Stanford Cardinal, but losses to the Miami Hurricanes and the Wichita State Shockers eliminated them from play per the tournament's double-elimination format. Capel played on the United States team in the 1982 Amateur World Series overseen by the International Baseball Federation. Starting against Australia, he pitched a 14–4 complete game victory, as the match ended after seven innings per the championship's ten run rule. The United States eventually placed third in the competition.
The 1983 Longhorns finished with a 61–14 record and were ranked as the number one team in the nation by "Collegiate Baseball Magazine". That season, the Texas team featured four future MLB pitchers: Capel, Clemens, Bruce Ruffin, and Schiraldi. In the 1983 College World Series, Capel allowed four hits in a complete game against the Michigan Wolverines as the Longhorns advanced to the World Series finals. Facing the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Longhorns made Clemens their starting pitcher and won 4–3. The championship was the fourth World Series title in University of Texas history, and their first since 1975. Capel finished the season with a 13–1 record and a 2.98 ERA. His career winning percentage (.957) ties him with Rick Burley for the fifth-best in Texas Longhorns history. In June, before the College World Series, he was drafted by the Cubs with the 320th overall pick in the 1983 MLB Draft.
Professional career.
Chicago Cubs.
After he signed a professional contract with the Cubs, Capel no longer threw sidearmed. Capel began professional baseball with the Class A Quad Cities Cubs, but was promoted to the Double-A Midland Cubs shortly into the season. Over 11 games, he finished with a 4–3 record and a 3.51 ERA. In 1984, Capel split playing time between the Class A-Advanced Lodi Crushers and Midland; he led Midland in losses (10) and wild pitches (11) and had the second-worst ERA (6.31) on the team. With Midland, Capel started 11 games out of the 16 that he appeared in. On his 0–7 record for the Crushers, Tom Alexander of the "Lodi News-Sentinel" wrote that Capel's luck "has been all bad when it comes to wins". Both Lodi and Midland finished their seasons with losing records.
From 1985–86, he played for the Double-A Pittsfield Cubs of the Eastern League. In 1986, Capel only pitched in relief, had a career-best 1.87 ERA over 62.2 innings pitched, and led his team with 13 saves. After he was promoted to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, Capel split time between starting and relieving roles in 1987. At 7–10, Capel tied for Iowa's lead in wins and losses, and led the team in strikeouts, with 75; his 7 wins became a career high, and his loss total matched a career high set in Midland three years earlier. After the season, Ray Sons of the "Chicago Sun-Times" said Capel "may be ready for middle relief in Chicago", and Dave van Dyck listed him as a prospect for the 1988 season. During winter, Capel, Greg Maddux, Manny Trillo, Damon Berryhill, and several other Cubs played for teams in the Caribbean. Capel played for the Águilas del Zulia of Venezuela and led the team with five saves.
Capel played in spring training ball as he tried to make Chicago's opening day roster. After the Cubs acquired Mike Bielecki from the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 31, 1988, they assigned Capel to Triple-A despite a "Sun-Times" prediction that he would be on the MLB roster. Prior to the acquisition, when Al Nipper was supposed to become the Cubs' fifth starter, Capel was to take his spot in the bullpen. The Cubs recalled Capel and Mark Grace to the majors on May 3, while Drew Hall and Rolando Roomes were optioned to Iowa; at the time, he had a 1.54 ERA and two saves in Triple-A ball. On May 7, Capel made his MLB debut: he pitched the final 1.2 innings of a game against the San Francisco Giants, allowing no runs and no hits but issuing a walk in a 2–1 Cubs loss. His first career win came the following day against the Giants, although he blew a save by giving up a two-run home run to Bob Brenly and lost a 5–4 lead. The Cubs ultimately won 13–7. Capel continued to pitch for the club until June 30, when the Cubs optioned him to Iowa to open a roster spot for Rich "Goose" Gossage to come off the 15-day disabled list (DL).
He returned to the MLB club on August 8 to replace Schiraldi, but was demoted on August 13 before making an appearance, as Chicago activated Les Lancaster from the DL. Capel rejoined the club on August 31, and pitched in five more games before the season's end. Over his first MLB season, Capel pitched in 20 games and allowed 16 earned runs over 29.1 innings for a 4.91 ERA. He pitched the entire 1989 season for Iowa, appearing in 64 games for the team. On October 15, Capel was granted free agency by the Cubs; he signed with the Brewers two months later.
Milwaukee Brewers.
Capel competed against 22 other pitchers for an MLB roster spot in the Brewers' spring training camp. The Brewers optioned Capel to their Triple-A affiliate, the Denver Zephyrs, on April 5, before the start of Milwaukee's 1990 season. On May 17, Denver placed Capel on the DL with a strained Achilles tendon, which opened a roster spot on the Zephyrs and allowed the Brewers to send Jaime Navarro back to Denver. When the Brewers needed a replacement for the injured Bill Wegman, Capel was called up to the major leagues. For his Brewers debut, Capel faced five batters and allowed four runs (two charged to Capel) against the Baltimore Orioles. His strikeout of Billy Ripken was the only MLB out Capel recorded in 1990. On June 8, he made his second and final outing with the Brewers and allowed four runs (three charged to Capel) against the Toronto Blue Jays; combined, batters hit .857 against Capel as he finished the season with a 135.00 ERA. When Greg Vaughn, returning from a turf toe injury and a sprained left ankle, was activated from the DL on June 11, Capel was sent to Triple-A. He finished the season with Denver where he had a 4–3 record with a 4.26 ERA. On October 4, the Brewers granted Capel free agency; he signed with the Astros on January 5, 1991.
Houston Astros.
Capel began his 1991 season with the Triple-A Tucson Toros; the Astros added Capel to their MLB roster on June 7. Two days later, against the New York Mets, Capel allowed the game-winning home run to Howard Johnson in the top of the 11th inning. Against the Mets on June 14, Capel, starting pitcher Pete Harnisch, and closer Jim Clancy combined for a four-hitter. His final MLB appearance came on August 14 against the San Diego Padres, when he pitched one inning in relief of Jim Corsi in a 4–1 loss. Capel said that pitching for Houston was "the high point of my career". Over 25 games pitched, Capel finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 3.03 ERA.
To reduce their roster to 35 players, the Astros assigned Capel and seven others to the Toros prior to the 1992 MLB season. Capel was selected to the Triple-A All-Star Game to replace Tim Scott, whom the Padres promoted to MLB. He told Javier Morales of the "Arizona Daily Star" that "this is one of the greatest thrills of my career", and he hoped it showed the Astros that he could pitch in MLB. Doug Jones worked as Houston's closer in 1992, however, and Capel never played for the MLB club. For the Toros, Capel had a 6–6 record and a 2.19 ERA with a team-leading 18 saves. The following season, the Montreal Expos invited Capel to their spring camp as a non-roster invitee. Capel elected to remain with the Astros organization where he allowed 26 earned runs in 32.2 innings and pitched the entire season in Triple-A. The Toros, managed by Rick Sweet, finished first in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) South Division with an 83–60 record and made the playoffs. Unlike the 1993 MLB playoffs, in which four teams competed, only two teams could make the PCL playoffs. In the championship series, the Toros faced the Portland Beavers, champions of the North Division and holders of a PCL-best 87–56 record. In a best-of-seven series, the Toros defeated the Beavers four games to two. After the season, the Astros did not re-sign Capel. While playing in MLB, Capel stood at and weighed .
Personal life.
In February 1986, Capel pitched in the University of Texas Alumni v. Varsity game, which ended in a 14–14 tie. Capel started using dipping tobacco in 1976 and in March 1988 had a non-cancerous lesion removed from his lip; as of March 1988, he was trying to quit the product. Capel met his wife, Elizabeth, at Roger Clemens' wedding. Outside of baseball, he is a close friend of Clemens, and during Clemens' 2012 perjury trial, Capel testified on his work ethic and character. In 2012, Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston.

<doc id="36628582" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36628582" title="Plastic Brit">
Plastic Brit

Plastic Brit, or Plastic Briton, is a pejorative term used to describe athletes who choose to represent Great Britain in international sport despite having personal connections to another country. Some media critics believe it undermines the purpose of international sport for the purpose of medals. The term came into popular use in 2012 when it was reported that 61 out of 542 (11%) of the British Olympic team had been born abroad.
History and use.
The term "Plastic Brit" is derived from Plastic Paddy, which is used to describe people who claim to be Irish despite not residing in that country. While the concept gained the British media's attention in the run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics, it had also been used in describing members of other British sporting teams. England's cricket team had a perceived problem of having too many foreign-born players. The England and Wales Cricket Board responded to the issue by lengthening the residency period before a foreign player can be accepted to play for England to seven years.
The term was popularised in the United Kingdom through its usage in the "Daily Mail" newspaper to describe athletes born outside the UK who had been selected to represent Great Britain at the London 2012 Summer Olympics. The term originally had foundations from South African-born Zola Budd having her British citizenship application fast tracked in order to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
Several athletes have been described by the press as "Plastic Brits". Tiffany Porter was selected as the captain of Great Britain's athletics team at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships despite being born in the United States. She was described as a "Plastic Brit" in the media for refusing to recite the words of the British national anthem, "God Save the Queen", at a press conference. After Porter broke the British record for the 100 metres hurdles, the previous record holder Angela Thorp said that she felt "devastated" that Porter had broken her record because she had expected Jessica Ennis to break it.
The term was used to describe a number of amateur wrestlers such as Myroslav Dykun and Yana Stadnik who had not been born in the UK and had been given British citizenship. Only one wrestler had competed for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics, Ukrainian-born Olga Butkevych. British Wrestling had the majority of its host nation berths removed by the British Olympic Association because of British Wrestling's failing to reach set performance targets. The term "Plastic Brit" was also used when there were calls for Arsenal's Spanish goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to play for the England national football team in 2009.
It was argued by some newspaper reporters that selecting athletes born outside of the UK was discriminatory against British-born athletes and was against the spirit of the Olympics. In 2012, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) imposed a mandatory three-year waiting period before athletes could compete in the Olympics for another country. In response, International Olympic Committee chairman Jacques Rogge said, "Then there are cases where there is support athletes competing for other countries but they go because there is a bigger gain the athlete in another country. Legally we can't stop it but it doesn't mean we love it." "The Independent" newspaper said that a third of Great Britain's gold medal winners at the Olympics and Paralympic games had a non-British parent or had been born outside of the UK.
A number of athletes were also critical of the term. Triple jumper Yamilé Aldama, who had been described as a "Plastic Brit", openly criticised the term in an article in "The Guardian" newspaper. She said, "I have lived in this country for 11 years, I am married to a British man, I have British children, I train under a British coach, at a British club. This is my home. What are they talking about?". Marathon runner Paula Radcliffe also criticised the term, asking for Great Britain supporters at the Olympics to support every athlete representing Great Britain, regardless of their countries of origin. Long-distance runner Mo Farah, when asked by a journalist if he should run for Somalia, said, "Look mate, this is my country. This is where I grew up, this is where I started life. This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I'm proud. I'm very proud. Was the Mail listening?" Fijian-born discus thrower Derek Derenalagi said in the "Evening Standard" that he was a "Titanium Brit" after he lost his legs in an explosion while serving with the British Army.

Ghigau

Ghigau (Cherokee: ᎩᎦᎤ) or Agigaue (Cherokee:ᎠᎩᎦᎤᎡ) is a Cherokee prestigious title meaning "beloved woman" or "war woman". 
The title was a recognition of great honor for women who made a significant impact within their community or exhibited great heroism on the battlefield. When a woman was bestowed as a Ghigau she was given great honor and responsibility. Due to changes in the Cherokee culture, it is no longer a function of responsibility assignment within the Cherokee culture.
Background.
The Ghigua title was given to extraordinary women by the Cherokee clans, and the title of great honor and responsibility was held for life. The Cherokees believed that the Great Spirit frequently spoke through the Ghigau. The Ghigau headed the Council of Women and held a voting seat in the Council of Chiefs. She was given the responsibility of prisoners and would decide their fate.
There are other similar words. For instance, the word Adageyudi (Cherokee:ᎠᏓᎨᏳᏗ) means "beloved" or "beloved woman". An even greater title would have been Chigau (Cherokee: ᏥᎦᎤ) meaning "greatly beloved woman".
Nancy Ward, the last Ghigau.
Nancy Ward, whose Cherokee name was Nanyehi, was a notable Ghigau who was born in the Cherokee town of Chota traditionally thought to be the daughter of a Cherokee woman named Tame Doe of the Wolf Clan. Tame Doe's brother was Attakullakulla. 
In 1755, the Cherokee fought against the Creeks. During the battle, Nanyehi's first husband of four years, Kingfisher, was killed. She was just 18 at the time, and victoriously led and fought in the battle against the Creeks. Her bravery and leadership resulted in her being bestowed with the title of Ghigau.
Nanyehi became aware of a planned attack against the white colonists during the Revolutionary War by Dragging Canoe, her cousin. She warned the colonists of the upcoming battle, which resulted in her being identified as a patriot for the Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and the Daughters of the American Revolution.
On Sept. 11, 1808 in council Broom's town, the ancient law of blood revenge was abolished by the Cherokee national government. The Cherokee, once ruled by clan loyalty, were moving toward a republican form of government. There was no longer a place in Cherokee government for a Ghigau. Ward was named the last woman bestowed with the honor and responsibility of being a Ghigau.
Seneca myth.
The Seneca myth speaks of two Cherokee Ghigau deciding the fate of a Seneca man in "A warrior cared for by wolves". "Among the Cherokees there were two women who were looked upon as the head women of the tribe. Each woman had two snakes tattooed on her lips--the upper jaws of the snakes were on the woman's upper lip, and opposite each other, the lower jaws on the lower lip in the same way. When the woman opened her mouth, the snakes seemed to open theirs. These women said, "This is the way to torment him; tie him near a fire and burn the soles of his feet till they are blistered, then let the water out of the blisters, put kernels of corn inside the skin, and chase him with clubs till he dies."

National Episcopal Conference of Cameroon

The bishops of Cameroon are the National Episcopal Conference of Cameroon (French: Episcopal Conférence Nationale du Cameroun, CENC). The origins date back to the missionaries of the Episcopal Conference. In fact, the missionaries were the first to Pallottines feel the need to meet to discuss issues related to the evangelization of the country. So in September 1906 in Douala gathered vicars apostolic and missionary in Cameroon than in a missionary synod, which was repeated at the beginning of 1914. The First World War and the expulsion of the German missionaries from the country, the outlook changed. In fact the mission in Cameroon, after the world war, was divided in two: the missions depended Anglophone Nigeria, while the Francophone Central Africa. In June 1949, held in Yaounde, the first plenary lecture of the Ordinaries of the missions of the French-speaking Cameroon: five bishops took part under the chairmanship of the Apostolic Delegate. A second conference, this time with all the ordinaries of the country, was held in Nkongsamba in April 1955: by this time the meetings were held regularly apostolic vicars. The Second Vatican Council gave great impetus to the formation of the episcopal conferences: the Cameroonian bishops met several times in Rome, on November 24, 1962 and officially founded the Episcopal Conference of Cameroon, who today took the official name in 1972 to its constitution, drawn up already this year, were approved by the Holy See in 1986.
The CENC is a member of the Association of Regional Conferences of the Region of Central Africa and Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM).

Pakyong Airport

Pakyong Airport is an airport under construction near Gangtok, the state capital of Sikkim, India. The airport, spread over , is located at Pakyong village about south of Gangtok. It is the first Greenfield airport to be constructed in the Northeastern Region of India and the first airport in the state of Sikkim. Presently, the nearest airport, Bagdogra Airport, to Sikkim is located away at Bagdogra in West Bengal.
The project was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in October 2008. The Punj Lloyd Group was awarded the 264-crore contract to construct a runway, taxiway, apron drainage system, and electrical work for the greenfield airport in January 2009. The foundation stone for the greenfield airport was laid by the then Civil Aviation Minister, Praful Patel, in February 2009.
When completed the airport will be one of the five highest airports in India. Although the project was slated to be completed by 2012, the airport is now likely to be operational by the end of December 2014, according to the Airports Authority of India (AAI).
Structure.
The airport is being built by the AAI at an estimated cost of 310 crore featuring a runway and a long taxiway connecting it to an apron measuring that can accommodate two ATR 72 aircraft at a time.
Also under construction are a terminal building measuring with a capacity of 100 passengers, a car park for 80 vehicles and a fire station cum Air Traffic Control Tower. The airport is expected to have navigation facilities such as NDB, DVOR, High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL), airport beacon, and a PAPI.
The land for the airport was carved from the mountainside using massive geotechnical 'cut and fill' engineering works. These state-of-the-art geogrid soil reinforcement and slope stabilisation techniques were employed as traditional retaining structures and embankments were ruled out as being unfeasible. Irish geotechnical company Maccaferri executed the project that envisaged a wide, long corridor on which the runway and airport buildings are to be constructed. The company, which completed the project with partners Mott MacDonald and Punj Lloyd, won the 'International Project of the Year' award at the Ground Engineering Awards 2012 for its work in constructing high reinforced soil walls and slopes at the site. The project is among the tallest reinforced soil structures in the world.

Leader (typography)

A leader in typography is a series of characters, usually dots or dashes, that are used as a visual aid to connect items on a page that might be separated by considerable horizontal distance. For example, dot leaders are often used in tables of contents to connect section headings with the page numbers on which those sections begin.
Most word processing software includes a feature for the automatic generation of dot leaders.
Unicode.
Although manual dot leaders are most often represented as a series of full stop characters, there are at least three Unicode characters dedicated to the representation of dot leaders. These are U+2024 ONE DOT LEADER, U+2025 TWO DOT LEADER, and U+2026 HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS (three dot leader).

Alessandro Figà Talamanca

Alessandro Figà Talamanca (born in Rome, 25 May 1938) is one of the most important living Italian mathematicians: he has been given several prestigious tasks, both in Italy and abroad. Several times, he took part in managing the Italian University system, and shared his opinions in newspapers, such as "La Repubblica. "He was a close friend of Carlo Pucci, a mathematician who spent most of his energy in improving the method of teaching maths in Italy, and the management of Italian Maths Departments. (Pucci was, especially, the re-founder of the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi.) From 1995 to 2003, Talamanca, successor to Pucci, was President of the Istituto, and he continued what Pucci had set up. He was also Vice-President of the European Mathematical Society.
Moreover, he was a member of the Consiglio Universitario Nazionale and, from 1999 to 2004, of the Comitato nazionale per la valutazione del sistema universitario - an institution that is supposed to find a way of improving the whole Italian University system.
He did research, and got valuable results, in the field of harmonic analysis, on aleatory Fourier series and the diffusion process, mostly in Rome - at La Sapienza -, but also in the US, especially in the Sixties. During that period he joined research activities in California, UCLA, where he got his Ph.D, in 1964, and, in the same year, was Acting Assistant Professor, and met the well-famous French-American mathematician Serge Lang, and also in Boston, Moore Instructor at MIT from 1966 to 1968.
While teaching at MIT, he read Tom M. Apostol's Calculus, a two volume book, and decided to bring it back to Italy - when he was to become Professor at the University of Genova - with him: he was the one who proposed an Italian edition of Apostol's work to a printer in Turin, and he himself overwatched the translation, in 1977. Talamanca has written a Calculus book himself, but, when given the first English-language Calculus class in the history of the faculty of Engineering of the Third University of Rome, he decided to make use of Lang's one. However, he has always preferred American books to Russian ones, such as Boris Demidovich's: he enjoys more the American friend-way of teaching Maths rather than the strong Soviet severity - as an example, in class he stated that, since now we have calculators, there's no use in learning the whole list of integrals that Demidovich reports.
He was Lecturer at Berkeley, from 1968 to 1969, then at Yale, from 1969 to 1970, then Visiting Professor in Maryland, in Washington, Wales and Sydney.
He taught Calculus for 50 years, including both Italian and American universities. Mostly, he referred to La Sapienza: in 2007, he became General Director of the Maths' Department there, but he was to leave in 2009 because he was 71. That's why he decided to accept to move to the Third University, where, in recognition of his prestige, he was given Calculus in English, to teach to foreign students,
He is able to speak English, and Modern Greek: and managed to hold a whole lesson at Athens in Greek. He told how hard it was, since, talking about very old times, there was no Greek dictionary detailed enough to contain, for instance, the word "differential equations": so, he was compelled to ask a Greek colleague a few minutes before starting - it was "Διαφορική εξίσωση" ["Diaforikì exisosi"]. It is pretty curious that, in Rome, the last student he examined was Greek!
He is also very interested in Analytic philosophy. Talking about that, he stated that "Russell"" was the start, then Gödel the end".
He has always been up against Eugene Garfield's Impact factor system in Science ("see here: L'Impact Factor nella valutazione della ricerca e nello sviluppo dell’editoria scientifica".

The MRWA B class was a class of steam locomotives built by Hawthorn Leslie in Tyneside, England, for the Midland Railway of Western Australia (MRWA). The class's wheel arrangement was 4-4-0.
Service history.
The nine members of the B class entered service in 1891. Withdrawals began in 1929, but the five longest serving units continued working on the MRWA, mainly as shunting engines, from then until the 1950s.
Preservation.
One B class locomotive, no B6, has been preserved. It is the only ex-MRWA steam locomotive still in existence. After being withdrawn by the MRWA in 1956, B6 was acquired by the then municipality of Geraldton, and put on display in a Geraldton park.
In 1995, ownership of B6 was transferred to the then Shire of Swan, and in 1999 the locomotive was moved to the former Midland Railway Workshops, for storage in the custody of Rail Heritage WA.
In 2010, following a renewal of interest by the City of Geraldton-Greenough in rail history, B6 was moved back to the Geraldton area, for intended eventual display at a proposed railway museum at Walkaway.

Moroccan genetics

Moroccan genetics encompasses the genetic history of the peoples of Morocco, and the genetic influence of this ancestry on world populations.
Genetic evidence.
The genetic proximity observed between Moroccans and Southern Europeans is due to the fact that both these groups shared a common ancestor either in the Upper Paleolithic, and in the Neolithic or alternatively during history with the invasion and the occupation during nearly seven centuries of the Iberian Peninsula by Moorish troops. A genetic study published in January 2012 stated that the indigenous North-west African ancestry appears most closely related to populations outside of Africa but "divergence between Moroccan people and Near Eastern/Europeans likely precedes the Holocene (>12,000 ya) and The Paleolithic (>40.000BC)."
Moroccan Y-DNA chromosome.
Recent studies make clear no significant genetic differences exist between Arabic and non-Arabic speaking populations, The human leukocyte antigen HLA DNA data suggest that most Moroccans are of a Berber origin and that Arabs who invaded North Africa and Spain in the 7th century did not substantially contribute to the gene pool. The Moorish refugees from Spain settled in the coast-towns. According to a 2000 article in "European Journal of Human Genetics", Moroccans from North-Western Africa were genetically closer to Iberians than to Sub-Saharan Africans of Bantu Ethnicity and Middle Easterners.
The different loci studied revealed close similarity between the Berbers and other north African groups, mainly with Moroccan Arabic-speakers, which is in accord with the hypothesis that the current Moroccan population has a strong Berber background.
Various population genetics studies along with historians such as Gabriel Camps and Charles-André Julien lend support to the idea that the bulk of the gene pool of modern Northwest Africans, irrespective of linguistic group, is derived from the Berber populations of the pre-Islamic period.
According to the X-Chromosome SNP analyses, the authors reported a high genetic homogeneity between berbers and Arabs in NW Africa, so they suggested that the Arabisation of this area was a cultural phenomenon, which did not imply a replacement of the ancestry population. Our results give support the hypothesis of an early settlement of NW Africa . The original berber population seem to have received a low genetic influx from the surrounding areas. Different hypothesis have been suggested to explain the genetic differentiation of the Moroccan population. An initial genetic drift could have caused differences in allele frequency distribution that have not been re-established due to a certain level of geographic isolation. The Strait of Gibraltar has been described by several authors as an important genetic barrier. Even a certain level of genetic exchange probably occurred between NW Africa and the South of the Iberian Peninsula, sharp frequency changes have been described in this area. Also the Sahara desert has been suggested as responsible of the genetic isolation of NW African populations from Sub-Saharan populations. There is no consensus about the impact of the Neolithic demic diffusion in the Mediterranean area. According to our results, a low impact of the Neolithic expansions and/or later migration events on NW African populations would have occurred.
X-Chromosome SNP analyses
The E1b1b1 clade is presently found in various forms in Morocco. Total E1b1b1 (E-M35) frequencies reached at 93.8% in Moroccans 
E1b1b1b1(E-M81), formerly E1b1b1b, E3b1b, and E3b2, is the most common Y chromosome haplogroup in Morocco, dominated by its sub-clade E-M183. This haplogroup reaches a mean frequency of 100% to 50% In North Africa, decreasing in frequency from approximately 85% or more in Moroccan Berber populations, including Saharawis, to approximately 25% to the east of this range in Egypt. Because of its prevalence among these groups and also others such as Mozabite, Riffians, Chleuhs, Middle Atlas, Kabyle and other Berber groups, it is sometimes referred to as a genetic Berber marker.
This phylogenetic tree of The Berber haplogroup subclades is based on the YCC 2008 tree and subsequent published research as summarized by ISOGG.
Average North African Moroccan Berbers have frequencies of E3b3 in the +80%. Alvarez "et al."(2009) study shows a frequency of E3b1b of 28/33 or 84.8% in Berbers from Marrakesh. With the rest of the frequencies being 1/33=3% E3a*, 1/33=3% E3b*, 1/33 or 3% E3b1a, and 1/33 or 3% E3b1c.
The most basal and rare E-M78* paragroup has been found at lower frequencies in Moroccan Arabs. The sub-clade: E1b1b1a1d (E-V65), is found in high levels in the Maghreb regions of far northern Africa. report levels of about 20% amongst Libyan Arab lineages, and about 30% amongst Moroccan Arabs. It appears to be less common amongst Berbers, but still present in levels of >10%. The authors suggest a North African origin for this lineage. In Europe, only a few individuals were found in Italy and Greece.
Capelli et al. 2009 studied the beta cluster in Europe. They found small amounts in Southern Italy, but also traces in Cantabria, Portugal and Galicia, with Cantabria having the highest level in Europe in their study, at 3.1% (5 out of 161 people).
Other frequencies of E1b1b1a1c (E-V22) is reported by Cruciani et al. (2007) include Moroccan Arabs (7.27%, 55 people) and Moroccan Jews (8%, 50 people).
Concerning E-M123 without checking for the E-M34 SNP is found at small frequencies in Morocco A Low regional percentages for E-M123 was reported in Moroccan Berbers around 3%.
Other haplogroups.
Eurasian haplogroups such as Haplogroup J and Haplogroup R1 have also been observed at very minimal frequencies. A thorough study by Cruciani et al. (2004) which analyzed populations from Morocco concludes that the North African pattern of Y-chromosomal variation (including both J1 and R1b haplogroups) is largely of Neolithic origin, which suggests that the Neolithic transition in this part of the world was accompanied by demic diffusion of Berber-speaking pastoralists from the Algerian Desert into Eastern Morocco, although later papers have suggested that this date could have been as long as ten thousand years ago, with the transition from the Oranian to the Capsian culture in North Africa.
Haplogroups G and T are rarely found in Morocco, In 147 samples taken in Morocco, 1% were found to be G.
In another study 1% of 312 samples in Morocco were G.
Another study gathered samples only from hamlets in Morocco's Azgour Valley, where none of 33 samples were determined G. These hamlets were selected because they were felt to be typically Berber in composition.
A study of 20 Moroccan Jews found 30% were G. The tested men were then apparently living in Israel. Another study of Jewish men found 19.3% of 83 Jewish men from Morocco belonged to haplogroup G. over G Moroccan samples are Likely Positive on the SNP G2a2b Haplogroup, it has been identified in neolithic human remains in Europe dating between 5000-3000BC.
Furthermore, the majority of all the male skeletons from the European Neolithic period have so far yielded Y-DNA belonging to this haplogroup like the mummified remains of Ötzi the Iceman, The National Geographic Society places haplogroup G origins in the Middle East 30,000 years ago and presumes that people carrying the haplogroup took part in the spread of the Neolithic into Africa and then Europe Two percent of Arab Moroccans and 0% to 8% of Berber Moroccans of Asni Oasis were likewise found to be G.
Haplogroup T is found amongst central berbers of Asni Oasis near the Algerian frontiers at 1,9% and observed in moroccan jews at 4%.
E1b1a is found at low frequencies in Morocco these lineages are found in some specific areas specially around the Great Desert Linked to the Slavery trade across the sahara like the presence of Haratins or Gnawa amongst Berbers of Asni Oasis located in North central Morocco near the Algerian frontiers, Sahrawis, Moroccan Arabs and in Southern Morocco.
Haplogroup A1a is observed in southern and central Moroccan berbers at 3%. related to the Homo-sapien Presence in North-west African Aterian and Mousterian Industries, one of The oldest Human branching event, is thought to have occurred about 140,000 years ago.
The most basal and rare E1a* paragroup has been found at lower frequencies in samples obtained from Moroccan Berbers, and Sahrawis. dated around 45.000BC Linked to Back-Eurasian Migration from the near east into North Africa along together with E1b1b during the Paleolithic times.
Haplogroup distributions in Moroccan people.
The major components of Y-DNA haplogroups present in Morocco (E3b ; 94%) are shared with European and neighboring North African and Near Eastern populations. Minor share of haplogroups also include those related to North West Africans (E1a, A1a; 1%),Near Easterners (J, G, T; 2,4%), Sub Saharans Africans (E3a; 1,7%) and Europeans (R1b, I1; 2%) affinity.
Some of the Major percentages identified were:
Berber Genetic Identity of Moroccans.
the prehistoric populations (The Berbers) of Morocco are related to the wider group of Paleo-Mediterranean peoples.
The Afroasiatic family probably originated in the mesolithic period, perhaps in the context of the Capsian culture. DNA analysis has found commonalities between Berber Moroccan populations and those of the Sami people of Scandinavia showing a link dating from around 9,000 years ago.
By 5000 BC, the populations of Morocco are an amalgamation of Ibero-Maurisian and a minority of Capsian stock blended with a more recent intrusion associated with the Neolithic revolution.
Out of these populations, the proto-Berber tribes form during the Late Paleolithic Era.
First settlers.
According to the leading evolutionary theory of human origins, known as the Out of Africa theory, anatomically modern humans first emerged in Africa 150,000-200,000 years ago. All non-Africans are descended from at least one group of humans who migrated out of Africa into western Asia 50,000-70,000 years ago. The first modern humans in Europe, the Cro-Magnon, arrived from North-west Africa and are believed to have completely replaced the previous inhabitants, the Neanderthals.
Cro-Magnons are known as Ibero-Maurisians or Mechta-Afalou People, they were in Morocco by 45,000 years ago or Probably they were Evolved from The Aterians, the Cro-Magnon people had populated much of North Africa. There was a massive major human migration from Morocco and this paleolithic population was weakly Mixed by later Capsian migrations during the Neolithic Era, this Prehistoric Population still survived and isolated in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco known until our days as Berbers.
Genetic Prehistoric Expansions.
DNA evidence suggests that during the Last Glacial Maximum, a period between 25,000 and 19,000 years ago, large ice sheets over a kilometer thick covered much of Northern Europe, making the region uninhabitable to humans. It is believed that human populations retreated south to warmer regions near the Mediterranean. Refuges during this period are believed to have been in Iberia, the Balkans and Italy. there was some gene flow from Morocco into Iberia.
After the Last Glacial Maximum, when the European climate warmed up, the refuges are thought to have been the source from which Europe was repopulated. Berber lineages that had been introduced into the Iberian refuge would have then dispersed all over Europe with the Northward expansion of humans. This could explain the presence of genetic lineages in Eastern Europe and as far North as Russia, that appear to have prehistoric links to Northwest Africa Mainly Morocco (see mtDNA). The expansion of human populations from Iberian refuges is also believed to have moved back to Morocco and Northwest Africa.
Neolithic to the end of the prehistoric.
The change from hunting and gathering to agriculture during the Neolithic Revolution was a watershed in world history. The societies that first made the change to agriculture are believed to have lived in North Africa and Middle East around 10,000 BCE. Agriculture was introduced into Europe by migrating farmers from the Middle East. According to the demic diffusion model, these Middle Eastern farmers either replaced or interbred with the local hunter-gather populations that had been living in Europe since the "out of Africa" migration.
It has been suggested that the first Middle Eastern farmers had North African influences mainly from The Capsian culture . There have been suggestions that some genetic lineages found in the Middle East arrived there during this period. The first Agricultural societies in the Middle East are generally thought to have emerged from the Natufian Culture, which existed in Palestine from 12,000 BCE-10,000 BCE. An important migration from North-West Africa occurred by the Ibero-Maurisians from Morocco across the Sinai appears to have occurred before the formation of the Natufian.
Genetic continuity in Morocco.
The population exhumed from the archaeological site of Tafughalt in Morocco (12,000 years BP) is a valuable source of information toward a better knowledge of the settlement of Northern Africa region and provides a revolutionary way to specify the origin of Ibero-Maurusian populations. Ancient DNA was extracted from 31 bone remains from Tafughalt.The HVS1 fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region was PCR-amplified and directly sequenced. Mitochondrial diversity in Tafughalt shows the absence of sub-Saharan haplogroups suggesting that Ibero-Maurisian individuals had not originated in sub-Saharan region.Our results reveal a probable local evolution of Tafughalt population and a genetic continuity in North Africa and Morocco.
Genetic Berber Heritage continuity of Moroccan Arabs.
The cultural differentiation present in North Africa between Berber and Arab samples seems not to reflect genetic differences between both groups, as shown in the AMOVA analyses, and the MDS and PC analyses. If Arabs in Northern Africa were mostly descendants of Middle Eastern Arabs, the frequencies of haplogroups such as N, U1, U3, U7, and HV that are much more prevalent in the Middle East than elsewhere should be larger in North African Arabs than in Berbers. However, the opposite is observed : these haplogroups add up to 5% in North African Arabs but to 10% in Berbers.
The lack of differentiation between North African Arabs and Berbers has also been observed using other genetic markers such as classical markers (Bosch et al. 1997); autosomal STRs (Bosch et al. 2000), Alu insertion polymorphisms (Comas et al. 2000); and Y-chromosome lineages 
This pattern suggests that the Arabization of the area was mainly a cultural process, rather than a demographic replacement of the Berber populations that inhabited the region where the Arabic expansion took place.
Moroccan Mitochondrial mtDNA.
The Moroccan mitochondrial pool is essentially Berber in its structure, characterized by an "overall high frequency of Western Eurasian haplogroups" Represented by the Post-last glacial maximum expansion from Iberia to North Africa revealed by fine characterization of mtDNA HV haplogroup in Morocco is Estimated around 36% to 60%, a somehow lower frequency of sub-Saharan L lineages, and a significant (but differential) presence of North African haplogroups U6 and M1". And according to Cherni et al. 2008 "the post-Last glacial maximum expansion originating in Iberia not only led to the resettlement of Europe but also of North Africa".
Caucasoid mtDNA (maternal) sequences, were detected at frequencies of 96% in Moroccan Berbers, 82% in Algerian Berbers and 78% in non-Berber Moroccans, compared with only 4% in a Senegalese population. 
Until recently, some papers suggested that the distribution of the main L haplogroups in Morocco was mainly due to trans-Saharan slave trade. However in September 2010, a thorough study about Berber mtDNA by Frigi "et al." concluded that most of L haplogroups were much older and introduced by an ancient African gene flow around 20,000 years ago.
in Otherways, Moroccan Northern and Southern Berbers have only 3% to 1% of SSA mtDNA, This north-south gradient in the sub-Saharan contribution to the gene pool is supported by "Esteban et al.", for the rest of mtDNA lineages mostly are Caucasian/West Eurasian, while Moroccan Arabs have more elevated SSA maternal admixture at around 21% to 36% Via L-mtDNA sequences, Highest frequencies of L-mtDNA is Reported to Moroccan Arabs of The Surrounding area of El jadida at 36%. Harich et al 2010
Frequencies (> 1%) of L-mtDNA
Genetic influence of Moroccans on Southern Europe.
Trombetta et al. (2011) felt that V257 showed a parallel with its sibling clade E-V68 in the way that both clades show signs of having migrated from North West Africa Likely Morocco to southwestern Europe across the Mediterranean sea. They found 6 "E-V257*" individuals in their samples who were E-V257, from a Moroccan Marrakesh Berber, a Corsican, a Sardinian, a southern Spaniard and a Cantabrian.
A study from Semino (published 2004) showed that Y-chromosome haplotype E1b1b1b (E-M81), is specific to Moroccan populations and almost absent in Europe except Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Sicily. Another 2004 study showed that E1b1b1b is found present, albeit at low levels throughout Southern Europe (ranging from 1.5% in Northern Italians, 2.2% in Central Italians, 1.6% in southern Spaniards, 3.5% in the French, 4% in the Northern Portuguese, 12.2% in the southern Portuguese and 41.2% in the genetic isolate of the Pasiegos from Cantabria).
The findings of this latter study contradict a more thorough Y-chromosome analysis of the Iberian peninsula according to which haplogroup E1b1b1b surpasses frequencies of 10% in Southern Spain. The study points only to a very limited influence from northern Africa and the Middle East both in historic and prehistoric times. The absence of microsatellite variation suggests a very recent arrival from Morocco consistent with historical exchanges across the Mediterranean during the period of Islamic expansion, namely of Berber populations. A study restricted to Portugal, concerning Y-chromosome lineages, revealed that "The mtDNA and Y data indicate that the Berber presence in that region dates prior to the Moorish expansion in 711 AD. ... Our data indicate that male Berbers, unlike sub-Saharan immigrants, constituted a long-lasting and continuous community in the country".
Haplotype V(p49/TaqI), a characteristic Moroccan haplotype, may be also found in the Iberian peninsula, and a decreasing North-South cline of frequency clearly establishes a gene flow from Morocco towards Iberia which is also consistent with Moorish presence in the peninsula. This North-South cline of frequency of halpotype V is to be observed throughout the Mediterranean region, ranging from frequencies of close to 30% in southern Portugal to around 10% in southern France. Similarly, the highest frequency in Italy is to be found in the southern island of Sicily (28%).
A wide-ranging study (published 2007) using 6,501 unrelated Y-chromosome samples from 81 populations found that: "Considering both these E-M78 sub-haplogroups (E-V12, E-V22, E-V65) and the E-M81 haplogroup, the contribution of Moroccan lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia (barring Pasiegos), continental Italy and Sicily can be estimated as 5.6%, 3.6% and 6.6%, respectively."
A study about Sicily by Gaetano "et al." 2008 found that "The Hg E3b1b-M81, widely diffused in northwestern African Moroccan populations, is estimated to contribute to the Sicilian gene pool at a rate of 6%." .
According to another recent study about Iberia by Adams et al. 2008 that analysed 1,140 unrelated Y-chromosome samples in Iberia, a much more important contribution of Moroccan lineages to the entire male gene pool of Iberia was found : "mean Moroccan admixture is 10.6%, with wide geographical variation, ranging from zero in Gascony to 21.7% in Northwest Castile".
In Europe, E-M81 is found everywhere but mostly in the Iberian Peninsula, where unlike in the rest of Europe it is more common than E-M78, with an average frequency around 5%. Its frequencies are higher in the western half of the peninsula with frequencies reaching 8% in Extremadura and South Portugal, 9% in Galicia, 10% in Western Andalusia and Northwest Castile and 9% to 17% in Cantabria. The highest frequencies of this clade found so far in Europe were observed in the Pasiegos from Cantabria, ranging from 18% (8/45) to 41% (23/56). An average frequency of 8.28% (54/652) has also been reported in the Spanish Canary Islands with frequencies over 10% in the three largest islands of Tenerife (10.68%), Gran Canaria (11.54%) and Fuerteventura (13.33%).
Genetic influences on Latin America.
As a consequence of Spanish and Portuguese colonization of Latin America, E-M81 is also found throughout Latin America and among Hispanic men in USA.
Other regions.
In other countries, Moroccan Berber haplogroups can be found in France, Sudan, Somalia, Jordan (4%), Lebanon and amongst Sephardi Jews.
Light Hair/Eyes amongst Moroccans.
Light Hair in Morocco.
Riffians and other Berbers of Atlas mountains of Morocco show a high percentage of blondism, higher than the other Berber groups in North Africa, however they are Not from Northern Europe, with about two thirds of Riffians being pinkish-white skinned with mixed or light eyes (reaching ⅘ or 80% in central Rif); the rest are of Mediterranean (mainly of classic Mediterranean or Berberid type, but many Moroccan Berbers show some blending with Classic Mediterraneans).
Blondism is strong in the Rif; over half of the adult men show some trace of it, and almost one tenth features red hair.
A Riffian or Moroccan Berber Nordic could be mistaken for an Irishman or an Englishman, less easily for a Scandinavian.
Nordics are ancient in Northern Africa as the Egyptian monuments of the Middle Kingdom ("circa" 2000 B.C.), and perhaps older. They survive today mostly in the mountains of the Rif, in Atlas Mountains of Morocco and the Canary Islands.
Moroccans in General are the most Lighted haired People in Africa and Arab world. blondism is more common in The Rif, and less common in the Atlas Mountains and the Atlantic seacoast; >15% of Berber Moroccan population has blond or light brown hair,
in the rest of Morocco is just less than 10% of the Population are blond.
Light Eyes in Morocco.
Moroccan Berbers of the Rif Mountains and Atlas Mountains mayhave the highest percentages of Light Eyes in Continental Africa and Arab world.
In the Rif, dark eyes are found among 30% of the men, mixed eyes 45%, and light eyes in 25%; and the mixed eyes have green or blue elements rather than gray. 
for Example Green eyes, are common among the Middle Atlas Berbers.
Physical Differences Between Berbers and Arabs of Morocco.
It is easier to tell a Berber from an Arab by dress and behavior than by external physical characteristics, but there are statistical differences, particularly between the tribal Arabs and the mountain Berbers.
The Arabs of this second group tend to be darker-skinned, less frequently light-eyed, more negroid by appearance and rarely blond. Compared to the Berbers, fewer have broad faces and more have convex nasal profiles.
by Carleton S. Coon.
The Andalusians can not be regarded just as Arabs in Morocco, mostly looks a mixture of Berbers,and Local Iberians in the History of Islamic Iberia (Gibraltar, Portugal and Spain). 
they're supposed to be migrants from southern Spain, but they do not exhibit any substantial contribution of European or Middle Easterner lineages, suggesting a North African origin for this ethnic group.
[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21581/abstract]
A small minority of the population is identified as Haratin and Gnawa, Half Negroid or typical Negroids of dark-skinned sedentary agriculturalists from the southern and eastern oases that speak either Berber or Moroccan Arabic. identified by Moroccans as A'Azzi or Sahrawi or Gnawa which meant Black or Half Black.

Stampede Dam

Stampede Dam (National ID # CA10192) is a dam in Sierra County, California, impounding the Little Truckee River.
The earthen and rock-filled dam was constructed in 1970, at 239 feet high and 1,511 feet long at the crest. It was a project of the United States Bureau of Reclamation, not primarily for flood control or irrigation storage as usual, but for fishery enhancement, primarily to facilitate the spawning of the critically endangered species cui-ui fish downstream. The dam is owned and operated by the Bureau.
The reservoir it creates, Stampede Reservoir, has a water surface of about 3,340 acres and about 25 miles of shoreline, with a maximum capacity of 226,500 acre-feet. Recreation includes fishing (for kokanee salmon, rainbow, brook, brown and lake (mackinaw) trout, etc.), hunting, boating, camping and hiking.

1970 1000km of Brands Hatch

The 1970 1000 km of Brands Hatch was an endurance race held at the Brands Hatch circuit in Kent, England, United Kingdom on April 12, 1970. The race was the 3rd round of the 1970 World Sportscar Championship season.
Pre-race.
New Zealander Chris Amon returned temporarily to Ferrari to drive one of their 512's, and he qualified his car on pole position. Amon's fellow countryman Denny Hulme drove a works Porsche 917K with factory driver Vic Elford. This race was only for prototypes; no GT cars were allowed to enter.
Race.
On the day of the race, the conditions were made awful by English heavy rain, wind and cold air. The race started with Elford, Jacky Ickx in another works Ferrari, Jo Siffert in works/John Wyer Porsche 917K all getting past Amon around the outside of Paddock Hill, and Amon was followed by Piers Courage in a works Alfa Romeo, Pedro Rodríguez in the other John Wyer Porsche and the rest of the field followed. 
At the end of the first lap, Barrie Smith in a privately entered Lola crashed heavily on the pit straight, and yellow flags were shown at the site of the accident. Rodriguez, who passed cars while yellow flags were being shown (oblivious to the fact), was shown the black flag and went into the pits while an astonishing 2nd, was reprimanded. Ickx, like Rodriguez- was a wet-weather specialist, had passed Elford and was leading the race. But he soon went into the pits with rain-wiper motor failure. 
Elford was back in the lead, but the flying Rodriguez, who had come up from coming out of the pits in 12th to 2nd by lap 15 (only about 25 minutes into the race), passed Elford and led the race. This was a lead he kept until the end; he and Elford drove their cars for 5 1/2 of the 6 1/2 hours of the race in the dreadful conditions, and Rodriguez won the race by 5 laps. Porsches romped home 1-2-3-4; the first 3 being 917K's. Rodriguez' performance was such that the race is sometimes known as "the day they forgot to tell Pedro it was raining".
The running of the race was changed from a 6 hour time limit to a 1000 kilometer overall distance.

Chu Ke-liang

Chu Ke-liang or Chu Ko-liang (; born 5 December 1946) is a Taiwanese actor and comedian most famous as a television show host. He is known for his "over-the-top appearance" with unusual clothing and hair styles and his coarse humor.
Career.
Chu was born Hsieh Hsin-ta (謝新達; Taiwanese "Siā Sin-ta̍t") in Zuoying, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Chu left home in his early teenage years to pursue his dream of being in the theater. He went on to receive tuition from Lin Sung-yen (林松煙 "Lín Sōngyān") and became an actor and writer but remained largely unknown to the wider public. At around age 30, he had a role in a play about the semi-legendary Liao Tianding as the clown character Zhū Gēliàng. He was so popular in this role that he chose the name as his own stage name.
Early career.
In 1980, the "Chu Ke-liang Cabaret Show" (豬哥亮歌廳秀; "Zhū Gēliàng Gētīng Xiù") broke onto the scene in Taiwan and Chu's popularity took off. In the show, Chu had a mild-mannered persona but often used coarse language and double entendre. He would get into quarrels with the guest singers and tell off-color jokes. Along with Chang Fei, Frankie Kao, and Ni Min-jan, Chu was one of Taiwan's biggest TV stars of the 1980s.
In 1994, Chu campaigned on behalf of James Soong Chu-yu in his candidacy for the governorship of Taiwan province. Soong successfully used support from Chu, who was at the time Taiwan's most popular entertainer, to help convince Taiwanese to support a candidate with a mainland Chinese background.
Hiatus.
Chu racked up gambling debts over NT$1 billion (US$35 million) from playing Taiwan's illegal lottery (大家樂) and Hong Kong's Mark Six despite an income of NT$60 million per month. He is said to have owed his boss, Yang Tang-kuei (楊登魁), NT$120 million. As a result, he fled into hiding to escape this and other debts to underworld figures in 1995. He briefly returned to the public eye in 1997 but again absconded in 1999.
Reports of Chu's whereabouts occasionally surfaced. In 2002, Chu was spotted in a He Xian Gu temple in Wandan, Pingtung County. However, generally, the media took pains not to expose him. Chu's performances were available on videotape and were occasionally shown on Taiwan television, so his audiences did not forget him.
On 19 February 2009, correspondents from the tabloid "Apple Daily" followed Chu in various areas of Kaohsiung and Pintung Counties before confronting him in a Yongda Road swordfish oden noodle restaurant in Pingtung City. With his trademark hair now slicked back, he told the reporters he was "still on the lam" and still very poor. He was reportedly working at a temple at the time.
Some of Chu’s former fellow performers, including Chang Fei, Frankie Kao and Chu Yen-ping, called for Chu to return to public life and for his creditors to spare his life so he could work to repay his debts.
Comeback.
Following Chu's exposure in an "Apple Daily" cover story, Sanchong legislator and former entertainer Yu Tien (余天), on 23 April 2010, announced an advertising deal between Chu and Tsann Kuen 3C whereby Chu would receive NT$20 million. The following day, Chu announced plans for a comeback in a short speech aired on Taiwan's major TV channels. Chu euphemistically said that he had been "studying abroad" for ten years but that he was grateful to the media for "photographing me eating oden". He said he had always wanted to come back but did not have the courage.
According to the "China Times", Yu facilitated a meeting between Chu and Chu's former boss Yang Tang-kuei where Yang agreed to forgive 80 percent off the total debt owed to him. Chu was required to give Yang 20 percent of his earnings until he repaid the remaining NT$24 million he owed.
On 5 June 2009, Golden Throne Communication TV Co., Ltd. announced a series of new video-on-demand shows starring Chu. Recording of a new variety show hosted by Chu, "Zhūgē Huìshè" (豬哥會社), began in July 2009. Chu received NT$300,000 per show for his new program .
On 16 September 2010, Chu released his first music album, "Dōngshānzàiqǐ" (東山再起). In the following month, he was recognized in the Golden Bell Awards as Best Variety Show Host, together with his co-host, Rene Hou.
Chu also had a major part as a city councilman in the 2011 hit movie "Night Market Hero", a role which cemented his comeback.
Image and influence.
Chu's screen image includes a distinctive hairstyle and clothing. Chu typically wears a (sometimes colorful) dinner jacket with a bowtie but with bermuda shorts, black shoes, and white socks. Chu's hairstyle has been called a "toilet-lid (馬桶蓋 "mǎtǒng gài") haircut" and is similar to a bowl cut like that of Moe Howard of the Three Stooges but covering the ears and shoulder-length in back.
Taiwanese entertainer Show Luo is a known admirer of Chu and has imitated his style.
Personal life.
Chu has been married four times and has two sons and three daughters. His second daughter, Jeannie Hsieh (謝金燕 "Xiè Jīnyàn"), is a well-known Taiwanese singer and actress.

No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit RAAF

No. 1 Operational Conversion Unit (No. 1 OCU) was an operational training unit of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Formed in January 1959 at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, its role was to convert pilots and navigators to the English Electric Canberra bombers flown by Nos. 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. The unit's complement of Canberras included T.4 and Mk.21 dual-control trainers, and Mk.20 bombers. Originally a component of No. 82 Wing, No. 1 OCU became an independent unit at Amberley in April 1968, its focus being the provision of operationally ready pilots for service with No. 2 Squadron in the Vietnam War. No. 1 OCU was disbanded in June 1971, following the withdrawal of No. 2 Squadron from South-East Asia. By then the RAAF's only Canberra unit, the squadron ran its own conversion courses before disbanding in 1982.
History.
During World War II, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) established a number of operational training units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills they had already learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice, however, impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, while the advent of the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated more a formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No. 2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.
In December 1953, No. 82 (Bomber) Wing, headquartered at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, took delivery of Australia's first jet bomber, the English Electric Canberra. Over the next five years, forty-eight Canberras built in Australia by the Government Aircraft Factory (GAF) re-equipped all three of the wing's flying units, Nos. 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. During this period, operational training of new bomber aircrew was performed "in-house" by the wing, primarily by No. 6 Squadron. Aside from its adverse affect on regular flying duties, the task was made technically challenging and potentially dangerous by virtue of the Canberra being designed for only one pilot, with a single control column. On 12 January 1959, No. 1 (Bomber) Operational Conversion Unit (No. 1 OCU) was formed at Amberley. Coming under the control of No. 82 Wing, its purpose was to convert pilots and navigators to the Canberra, and train them for operations with Nos. 1, 2 and 6 Squadrons. On establishment, the unit was commanded by Squadron Leader B.F.M. Rachinger, and equipped with Mk.20 bombers and T.4 trainers. The T.4 was a dual-control model with three seats; the pilot and instructor sat side by side at the front of the cockpit, with the navigator seated behind them. Two of these models had been purchased from Britain. The unit was subsequently allocated Mk.21 trainers; GAF built seven of these dual-control models by converting five early Mk.20s and two British-built B.2 bombers. Student aircrew underwent bombing and navigation instruction, as well as simulated operations. The first training course graduated in April 1959.
In addition to training, over the course of No. 1 OCU's existence its aircrews flew operational sorties involving naval cooperation, aerial photography, target towing and radar targeting, and participated in exercises in Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and New Zealand. During runway upgrades at Amberley in mid-1962, the unit was based for a month at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. Later that year, it briefly maintained a detachment at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland. On 11 September 1964, one of its Canberras was intercepted by a Sabre fighter of No. 76 Squadron based at RAAF Base Darwin, Northern Territory, as part of Operation Handover, a little-known contingency plan put into effect during "Konfrontasi" to guard against possible attack by Indonesian forces following the recent establishment of the Federation of Malaysia. No. 1 OCU suffered a fatal accident on 16 February 1965, when a Canberra Mk.21 ran off the runway and crashed at Amberley, killing both crew members. The unit was made independent of No. 82 Wing in April 1968. Its role from then on was to provide trained crews solely for No. 2 Squadron, which was on active duty in the Vietnam War. At the same time, maintenance responsibilities for the Canberras transferred from No. 482 Squadron to No. 1 OCU, along with relevant staff and equipment. Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F-111C, expected to enter service soon afterwards. Delivery of the F-111s was delayed, however, so Nos. 1 and 6 Squadrons began operating leased F-4E Phantoms as an interim strike force in 1970.
To prepare aircrew for their rotation through No. 2 Squadron in Vietnam, No. 1 OCU students participated in exercises such as "Combat Skyspot" in August 1968, which utilised radar controlled by No. 30 Squadron, and "Strait Kris" in September–October 1969, in conjunction with the Australian Army. The unit lost two more aircrew when a Canberra M.21 on a training flight crashed near Amberley on 23 March 1970. From 21 March to 25 April 1971, four of the unit's aircraft flew 10,000 miles around Australia to conduct seven flying displays as part of the RAAF's Golden Jubilee celebrations. Having completed thirty-six conversion courses in its twelve years of operation, No. 1 OCU was disbanded on 9 June 1971, following the withdrawal of No. 2 Squadron from Vietnam. Unit staff were transferred to No. 2 Squadron, which continued to operate the Canberra and carry out its own operational conversion until disbanding in June 1982. Ten of No. 1 OCU's fifteen Canberras were put into storage while the remainder, including surviving Mk.21 trainers, were taken on by No. 2 Squadron. When the F-111C eventually entered service with No. 82 Wing in 1973, No. 6 Squadron again took responsibility for conversion training, while No. 1 Squadron acted as the lead strike unit. Canberra A84-236, which was allocated to No. 1 OCU in 1968 and 1970 when not in service with No. 2 Squadron in Vietnam, went on display at RAAF Museum, Point Cook, Victoria, in 1982.

Wildstands

Wildstands is a community alliance initiative supporting awareness of British Columbia (BC) forestry issues, protecting wilderness on Cortes Island from unsustainable logging practices, and promoting positive solutions for logging in the region.
An industrial logging machine is mowing down Vancouver Island forests at an accelerating rate for the purpose of raw log export. Corporate owners with close yet complex relationships and recurring faces view these forests as distressed assets in need of liquidation. The government of BC, hungry for short-term cash, clears the way for them.
News of the proposed logging on the island of 1,000 has attracted about 6,000 signatures to an anti-logging petition and planning is underway to stop Island Timberlands in its tracks. The petition demands that Island Timberlands and its parent company, Brookfield Asset Management, retain all remnants of old-growth forest, protect all watersheds and salmonid habitat, respect all the goals of the BC Sensitive Ecosystem Inventory and ban use of clear-cut logging methods.

Mrzli Potok

Mrzli Potok (; , Gottscheerish: "Kaotnprunn") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Gotenica.
Name.
The Slovene name "Mrzli Potok" literally means 'cold creek'. It is semantically similar to the German name "Kaltenbrunn", literally, 'cold spring. There is a spring at the site of the former settlement known as Cold Spring ().
History.
A small settlement known as "Brunn bei Masern" (literally, 'spring near Grčarice') existed in the land registry of 1574, cited therein as "Beim Prun" ('by the spring'). It had one full farm divided into two half farms, corresponding to a population between eight and 12. It was not mentioned in the 1770 census, and Erich Petschauer concludes that it was absorbed into Grčarice. However, Ivan Simonič identifies Brunn bei Masern with Mrzli Potok.
In the 19th century, a steam-powered sawmill owned by the Auersperg noble family operated at Mrzli Potok. It was established in 1871. Before the Second World War the settlement had five houses with a variable population.

Nageshwara Rao Park

Nageswara Rao Park is a park located on Luz Corner in Mylapore, Chennai, India. The park, with a separate play area for children, is kept open to the public from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m. and is a popular place for morning walks among the locals. The park also hosts music kutcheris and civic forums. The park has a badminton court. The park is maintained by Sundaram Finance.
History.
Nageswara Rao Park was originally called "Arathakuttai" (big pond). In deference to a request by the Chennai Corporation, the owners of the pond, Ramayamma Pantulu, Aravamutha Iyengar and Nainiappa Mudaliar, donated the pond to the civic body for creating a park. After its creation, the park was named after Desodharaka Nageswara Rao Pantulu. It was opened to the public by P. S. Kumaraswamy Raja, the then Chief Minister of Madras, on 20 October 1940. Originally developed in a much smaller area on Luz Church Road, the park was expanded when more land was donated by Ramayee Ammal, M. Nainappa Mudaliyar, V. Kumaraswamy Raja and Aravamadhu Iyengar in the same year. In 1996, the Chennai Corporation re-developed the park and started maintaining it. A pond known as "Aaratha kuttai" was filled in and made into a garden. It was Nageswara Rao, founder of the neighbouring Amrutanjan factory, who convinced the local residents to develop the area when the pond began to dry up. It is in his memory that the park was named after him.
Flora.
Tree varieties found in the park include Lapostromea, Cassia fistula, Tabulia and foliage trees like Pungam, Neem, palms, Ficus religeosa and Thespesia. Medicinal and ornamental plants such as Tabubia, Copper pod, Enterolobium saman, Cassia sp. and Ixora sp. are also found in the park.
Developments.
In 2002, an initiative named "Project Green Spaces - Dr. Nageswara Rao Park" was started, whereby the park was adopted by the Chennai Chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce in India (AMCHAM). This also included support from the local community, which had donated for the face-lift of the park. The estimated initial costs of the face-lift was pegged at 3 million, while the ongoing costs at 600,000 per annum. The establishment of a corpus fund of 10 million for the upkeep of the park was also proposed.
In 2009, a composting yard consisting of three pits was set up at the rear of the park to make compost from the garden waste that are collected from eight bins in the park. The project is funded by Sundaram Finance, which also maintains the park belonging to the Chennai Corporation.
Incidents.
On 7 November 2010, a man was killed while taking a morning stroll on the dedicated track in the park, when a tree branch snapped off and fell on his head after a heavy rain due to cyclone that passed near the city after a gap of 14 years.

Nasolacrimal duct obstruction

Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is the obstruction of nasolacrimal duct and may be either congenital or acquired. Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct leads to the excess overflow of tears called epiphora.
Sign and symptoms.
Excessive tearing is the most important complaint of patients with NLDO. Pain at the side of the nose suggests dacryocystitis.
Etiology.
Involutional stenosis.
Involutional stenosis is probably the most common cause of NLD obstruction in older persons. It affects women twice as frequently as men. Although the inciting event in this process is unknown clinicopathologic study suggests that compression of the lumen of the NLD is caused by inflammatory infiltrates and edema. This may be the result of an unidentified infection or possibly an autoimmune disease.
Dacryolith.
Dacryoliths or cast formation, within the lacrimal sac can also produce obstruction of the NLD.
Sinus disease.
Sinus disease often occurs in conjunction with, and in other instances may contribute to the development of NLD obstruction. Patients should be asked about previous sinus surgery, as the NLD is sometimes damaged when the maxillary sinus ostium is being enlarged anteriorly.
Trauma.
Naso-orbital fractures may involve the NLD. Early treatment by fracture reduction with stenting of the entire lacrimal drainage system should be considered. However, such injuries are often not recognized or are initially neglected as more serious injuries are managed. In such cases, late treatment of persistent epiphora usually requires DCR.
Inflammatory disease.
Granulomatous disease, including sarcoidosis, Wegener granulomatosis,and midline granuloma, may also lead to NLD obstruction.
Lacrimal plugs.
As with similar cases of canalicular obstruction, dislodged punctal and canalicular plugs can migrate to and occlude the NLD.
Neoplasm.
Neoplasm should be considered in any patient presenting with NLD obstruction.In patients with an atypical presentation, including younger age and male gender,further workup is appropriate. Bloody punctal discharge or lacrimal sac distension above the medial canthal tendon is also highly suggestive of neoplasm.
Congenital.
Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is most often due to an imperforate membrane at the valve of Hasner.
Diagnosis.
Evaluation is in the form of a dye disappearance test followed by irrigation test. By using this sequence (with modifications) as a guide, the physician can frequently streamline diagnostic testing.
Dye disappearance test.
The dye disappearance test (DDT) is useful for assessing the presence or absence of adequate lacrimal outflow, especially in unilateral cases. It is more heavily relied upon in children, in whom lacrimal irrigation is impossible without deep sedation. Using a drop of sterile 2% fluorescein solution or a moistened fluoresce in strip, the examiner instills fluorescein into the conjunctival fornices of each eye and then observes the tear film, preferably with the cobalt blue filter of the slit lamp. Persistence of significant dye and, particularly asymmetric clearance of the dye from the tear meniscus over a 5-minute period indicate an obstruction. If the DDT result is normal, severe lacrimal drainage dysfunction is highly unlikely. Variations of the DDT are the Jones tests.
Irrigation test.
In irrigation test, a lacrimal irrigation cannula is passed into the punctum and advanced through the canaliculus to the lacrimal fossa. Clear water or saline is then irrigated through the cannula. If fluid passes into the nose without reflux out of the opposite canaliculus, the system is patent. If no fluid passes but it all comes back through either punctum, nasolacrimal duct obstruction is present.
Management.
Intubation and stenting.
Some clinicians believe that partial stenosis of the NLD with symptomatic epiphora sometimes responds to surgical intubation of the entire lacrimal drainage system. This procedure should be performed only if the tubes can be passed easily. In complete NLD obstruction, intubation alone is not effective, and a DCR should be considered.
Dacryocyctorhinostomy (DCR).
A DCR is the treatment of choice for most patients with acquired NLD obstruction. Surgical indications include recurrent dacryocystitis, chronic mucoid reflux, painful distension of the lacrimal sac, and bothersome epiphora. For patients with dacryocystitis, active infection should be cleared, if possible, before DCR is performed.

François Nicolas Fririon

François Nicolas Mathus Fririon (7 February 1766 – 25 September 1840) joined the French army and rose through the ranks during the French Revolutionary Wars to become a general officer by 1800. After commanding a brigade with distinction during the War of the Fifth Coalition at Aspern-Essling and Wagram he was promoted and made chief of staff to Marshal André Masséna. He served in this role during Masséna's 1810–1811 invasion of Portugal. His surname is one of the Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe.
Early career.
Friron was born on 7 February 1766 in Vandieres in what later became Meurthe department in eastern France. He joined the French Royal Army in 1782 as a volunteer. After the start of the French Revolutionary Wars he was promoted to chef de bataillon (major) in 1794 and adjutant general in 1796. He fought in Switzerland and later in Italy under Barthélemy Louis Joseph Schérer. He served as chief of staff to Jacques Maurice Hatry at the Battle of Verona on 26 March 1799 and the Battle of Magnano on 5 April. After fighting on the Rhine in 1799, Jean Victor Marie Moreau nominated him for promotion. His promotion to general of brigade came through on 17 July 1800. Subsequently he fought at the Battle of Hohenlinden.
During the peace, he commanded the troops in the Bas-Rhin department. He later fought under Marshal André Masséna in Italy. He served at the Siege of Stralsund which lasted from 15 January to 20 August 1807, when the Swedish garrison abandoned the city. On 25 August he and French naval Captain Montcabrié attacked the fortified island of Dänholm between Stralsund and Rügen. The 1,200-man French force included one battalion of the 30th Light Infantry Regiment, two artillery pieces and crews, and detachments of sappers, miners, and marines of the Imperial Guard. The operation was a success, costing the French only 15 dead and 26 wounded. The 900-man Swedish garrison lost 50 killed, 75 wounded, and 517 captured. Six field pieces and eight heavy cannons also fell into French hands. The following year found him serving under Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte in Denmark. He was present during the mutiny of two Spanish regiments on 31 July 1808, during which his aide was killed. This event preceded the evacuation of the La Romana Division.
In the 1809 war, he led a brigade in Jean Boudet's IV Corps division. The brigade consisted only of two battalions of the 3rd Light Infantry Regiment and began the campaign with 1,545 men. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Boudet's division heroically defended Essling for the better part of two days against repeated Austrian attacks. Finally, at 3:00 PM on 22 May the troops were chased out of the village except for the granary where Boudet and some grenadiers held out. During the struggle, Marshal Jean Lannes wrote out a special commendation for Fririon, thanking him and his brigade for valiant fighting. Essling was later retaken by the Imperial Guard, but Lannes was mortally wounded in the fighting. Fririon led his brigade at the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July 1809. The two battalions of the 3rd Light numbered 1,270 men.
With Masséna in Portugal.
He was promoted to general of division on 21 July 1809. He soon became chief of staff to Marshal André Masséna, replacing Nicolas Léonard Beker who had angered Emperor Napoleon. He continued in his role as Masséna's chief of staff during the 1810–1811 invasion of Portugal. At the Siege of Almeida Fririon carried an ultimatum to William Cox after the fort's main magazine exploded, killing 600 defenders. Cox surrendered the next day, on 27 August.
The Battle of Bussaco was fought on 27 September 1810. The night before, Fririon recommended that Arthur Wellesley, Viscount Wellington's Anglo-Portuguese army be flanked out of position instead of assaulted directly. Masséna dismissed this idea, saying, "You are of the Army of the Rhine, you like to maneuver; this is the first time that Wellington appears disposed to offer battle. I will profit by the occasion." The attack was a failure with the French suffering 4,479 killed, wounded or captured against only 1,252 Allied casualties. While the French army was before the Lines of Torres Vedras, Fririon urged that the VIII Corps be withdrawn from its exposed position at the village of Sobral.
Fririon died on 25 September 1840. His son published his papers in 1841 as, "Journal historique de la campagne de Portugal". The work was critical of Masséna's aide Jean-Jacques Germain Pelet-Clozeau who later wrote a history of the campaign. But unlike others who wrote that Pelet had undue influence over the marshal, Fririon minimized Pelet's role. FRIRION is on the east side of the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 16.

Parks in Chennai

The city of Chennai has an estimated 4.5 percent of its area under green cover. The share of Chennai's greenspace is dominated by the Guindy National Park, with an area of 2.71 sq km, which covers a vast area south of the Adyar River.
The seven zones of the old corporation limits has about 260 public parks, 154 traffic islands and 103 centre median parks, maintained by the parks department of the Corporation of Chennai, many of which suffer poor maintenance. Public parks include 88 notified parks, 73 park sites in extended areas, and more than 100 open spaces that have been earmarked for recreation purposes. The eight zones in the newly added areas of the city have about 265 locations that have been identified for development of new parks. The largest among the parks in the city is the 358-acre Tholkappia Poonga, developed to restore the fragile ecosystem of the Adyar estuary.
Chennai's greenspace is further augmented by a network of open spaces containing forests, prairies, wetlands, canals, streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas along the city's periphery.
In pre-Independence days, the ceiling on the number of permanent workers for maintenance of city parks was fixed at 350. This has not been revised till date.

Afranius Hannibalianus

Afranius Hannibalianus (fl. 3rd century) was a Roman senator and military officer who was appointed consul in AD 292.
Biography.
Believed to belong to a family who originated from the eastern provinces of the Roman empire, Hannibalianus was a military commander who served under the emperor Marcus Aurelius Probus. A member of the Equestrian order (as noted by the official reference to him as a "vir eminentissimus", which was reserved for the equestrian order), he probably was only adlected to the senatorial order after the death of Probus in AD 282.
He was elevated to the rank of Praetorian prefect of the west in AD 286 under Maximian, and had led the imperial armies to victory over the Germanic tribes along the Rhine in that year. Hannibalianus held this rank until probably AD 292, when he was appointed "consul prior" alongside Julius Asclepiodotus. Then from AD 297-298, he served as the "Praefectus urbi" of Rome.
Hannibalianus was possibly married to Eutropia, who divorced him to marry the emperor Maximian in around AD 287, but this has been contested. If so, they had one daughter, Flavia Maximiana Theodora who married the future emperor Constantius Chlorus. It has been speculated that Hannibalianus’ acceptance of his wife’s new marriage as well as his position as step-father to the Caesar Constantius accounted for his rapid rise through the administrative offices of the empire.

Danpusan Kofun

The largest keyhole-shaped kofun in the Tokai region of Japan, the Dampusan Kofun dates from the early 6th century. The burial mound has a total length of 151 meters, with the circular portion containing the burial chamber having a diameter of 80 meters, and a height of 16.2 meters. The 116-meter rectangular portion is terraced into three tiers, from which numerous fragments of Hagi ware haniwa cylinders and Sue ware pottery have been recovered. Many of these artifacts are currently preserved at the Anthropological Museum of Nanzan University.
The presence of a large number of rounded river boulders indicates that the surface may have originally been paved with stones. The tomb was originally surrounded by at least one moat, but the urbanization of the surrounding area in the post-World War II era has obliterated most traces.
The interior of the burial mound has not been excavated by modern methods. The name or rank of the person buried in the tomb is unknown. Per legend, the inhabitant of the tomb is Miyazuhime, the wife of Prince Yamato Takeru, whose purported grave is located nearby. Another theory is that the tomb is that of a powerful chieftain of the Owari clan, perhaps the Owari no Kusaka, who is mentioned in the "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki" chronicles of the Nara period, and whose daughter married the semi-legendary Emperor Keitai.
The Dampusan Kofun was under the management of Atsuta Shrine until World War II. After the war, it came under the control of Nagoya city until 1980, when it was taken over by the Aichi Prefectural government. From July 9, 1987 the Dampusan Kofun has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site.

John Versor

John Versor (, ) (died c.1485) was a French Dominican, known as a Thomist philosopher and commentator on Aristotle.
He was Rector of the University of Paris in 1458.
Works.
Though traditionally Versor has often been considered a Thomist, more recent studies show his dependence on both Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great, and evidence suggests that, by his contemporaries, Versor was regarded as an authority of his own. His commentaries covered most of the works of Aristotle, and his textbooks were very widely circulated in the period 1470 to 1520.
A large part of his questions on Aristotle and Aquinas was translated into Hebrew by Eli Habillo, during the 1470s. Questions on Aristotle were printed in a number of editions at Cologne, from 1485 onwards.

Sodak Gaming

Sodak Gaming, Inc. was a gaming company based in Rapid City, South Dakota that distributed slot machines to Indian casinos and financed casino projects. It was acquired by International Game Technology (IGT) in 1999 for $230 million.
Sodak was formed in 1989 to supply equipment to gambling halls in Deadwood, South Dakota, and soon became the exclusive distributor of IGT machines to tribal casinos. The Promus Companies acquired a 20 percent stake in Sodak in November 1992. Sodak made its initial public offering in June 1993.
Sodak purchased and refitted a riverboat and leased it to Gaming Supply Co., who opened it in December 1994 as the Miss Marquette casino, in Marquette, Iowa. After Gaming Supply defaulted on lease payments, Sodak bought out the company for less than $5.5 million, taking over operation of the casino. As regulations forbade IGT from owning a casino, the Miss Marquette was placed on the market before the merger, and sold to Lady Luck Gaming for $42 million.

Virginia Smith Dam (also known as Calamus Dam; National ID # NE82904) is a dam in Garfield County, Nebraska, about five miles northwest of Burwell.
The earthen dam was constructed in 1985 by the United States Bureau of Reclamation with a height of 96 feet and 147 feet long at its crest. It impounds the Calamus River for irrigation storage and flood control, as part of the North Loup Division of the extensive, multi-state Pick–Sloan Missouri Basin Program. The dam is owned by the Bureau and is operated by the local Twin Loup Irrigation District.
The reservoir it creates, Calamus Reservoir, has a water surface of 5,142 acres, 6,404 land acres, about 31 miles of shoreline, and a maximum capacity of 27,400 acre-feet. Recreation includes fishing (walleye, wiper, white bass, northern pike, largemouth bass, rainbow trout, and crappie, etc.), hunting, boating, camping and hiking. The reservoir is also the site of the state Calamus Reservoir State Recreation Area and Wildlife Management Area. Although the dam itself is located in Garfield County, most of the reservoir lies in Loup County, to its west.

English Fury at Mechelen

The English Fury at Mechelen was an event in the Eighty Years' War on April 9, 1580 in which the city of Mechelen was conquered by Calvinist forces from Brussels supported by English mercenaries and brutally sacked. 
Prelude.
In 1579, the Lordship of Mechelen was one of the few territories in the Netherlands that had remained loyal to the Spanish King. Most surrounding cities, like Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent were ruled by Calvinists. 
There in 1580, plans were made to take over all remaining loyal cities, to deny the Spanish army any stronghold behind the frontline.
Mechelen taken.
The Calvinist mayor of Brussels, Olivier van den Tympel, gathered a military force, supported by English mercenaries under command of John Norreys and Scottish under command of captain Stuart. 
After a short battle with Mechelen's Schutterij and civil guards, the city was easily taken.<br>
But then, the English mercenaries turned against the population and plundered homes, churches and monasteries.<br>
Some 60 civilians were killed.
The later Archbishop Mathias Hovius hid in a cupboard for 3 days and then fled the city, dressed as a peasant.
Mechelen remained under Calvinist rule until it was reconquered in 1585 by the Spanish under Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma as one of the last cities in the Southern Netherlands.
The 1580 event was named the "English Fury" after the "Spanish Fury" that hit the city in 1572.
