Investment outsourcing

Investment outsourcing is the process whereby institutional investors and high net worth families engage a third party to manage all or a portion of their investment portfolio. This arrangement can include functions such as establishing the asset allocation, selecting investment managers, implementing portfolio decisions (both strategic and tactical), providing on-going oversight, performing risk management and other areas of portfolio management.
Outsourced investment management is a large and growing market segment with over half a trillion dollars currently managed by outsourced managers. According to a survey of outsourcers by aiCIO magazine, the volume of outsourced assets increased 200% between 2007 and 2011.
The outsourcing trend began with smaller institutions that could not or did not want to build an internal investment team. According to a study by the Family Wealth Alliance, approximately four in ten wealthy families have outsourced discretionary investment authority. The trend is even clearer among families with less than $500 million in assets where two-thirds have outsourced management. Similarly, just 11% of college endowments between $100 and $500 million internally manage their portfolios and instead rely on outsourced managers. Increasingly, however, it is not just small investors seeking to outsource. There has been a marked increase in the number of multibillion outsourcing engagements since the 2008 financial crisis as firms grapple with increasing complexity and the need for better risk management.
Investment outsourcing goes by many names including "fiduciary management", “outsourced chief investment officer”, “outsourced CIO,” “OCIO,”, “CIO in a box,” and “implemented consulting.”
Outsourcing Models.
Background.
Jonathan Hirtle, Chief Executive Officer for Hirtle, Callaghan & Co., pioneered the outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) model, which serves family groups and organizations that do not employ fully staffed investment departments. For his OCIO innovations, Hirtle has been dubbed the “Oracle of Outsource.”
Current OCIO models.
The model by which outsourced CIOs service clients is still evolving in this nascent business. The most common model is to outsource all decision making including asset allocation, manager selection and monitoring. The OCIO reports back to the client but the burden is largely lifted from the client and placed on the new provider. Among OCIOs utilizing this approach, there is a “continuum of outsourcing approaches and providers: manager-of-manager programs; funds-of-funds; former CIOs offering a diversified model portfolio.” The common thread amongst these approaches is the use of commingled funds or model portfolios which creates economies of scale for the OCIO.
A different model is pursued by a small subset of the OCIO universe. The members of this group work alongside the client’s staff – not as a replacement to them. According to investment industry newsletter FundFire, “An increasing number of CIOs see outsourcing not as a threat to their job, but as a source of complementary expertise and advice, as well as investment opportunities.” Like much of the nomenclature around the OCIO business, this more customized, bespoke solution does not yet have a widely recognized name. Fiduciary Research (FRC), an OCIO who oversees about $9 billion on behalf of a small list of pension fund clients, calls itself an iCIO for integrated chief investment office.
Fees.
The fees charged by outsourced managers vary widely based upon a number of factors but are generally between 30 and 100 bps with some firms also charging an incentive fee in addition to their base management fee. Firms with particular expertise in alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity and real assets plus those with in-house risk management capabilities usually command higher fees. In some quarters discontent has been voiced about investment outsourcing firms which allocate client capital to proprietary products charging a second layer of fees.
Investment Outsourcers By Assets.
The next two tables use data from Charles Skorina & Company’s “Ultimate Outsourcer’s List” and is divided into two categories: 1) outsourcers who advise on a diverse set of mandates including pensions, non-profits and family trusts and 2) university endowment-style outsource managers. The list curated by Skorina & Company is more expansive than the other most commonly referenced list prepared by "Pensions & Investments" "(P&I)". The P&I list counts only the top 25 and is available only to paid subscribers.
Consultants Push into Outsourcing.
In the general investment outsourcing area, where outsourcers serve a variety of clients including pension funds, non-profits and families, the business grew out of investment consulting firms and to a lesser extent large banks and money managers. In the early 1970s, as corporate pension plans were implementing ERISA, investment consulting firms came of age. Large organizations often had both in-house investment staffs and investment committees populated by sophisticated professionals. These groups wanted to make all important decisions themselves, and therefore they looked to the consultants only for recommendations, especially regarding asset allocation and manager selection. “In other words, investment consulting began, and remained for many decades, a non-discretionary, advisory-only model for delivering investment advice. The consultants made recommendations, but the clients decided what to do.” Northern Trust was the first firm to offer an outsourced model in 1979 followed a year later by Russell Investments.
Investment consultants have been eager to exit the “largely unsatisfactory, low-margin, and litigious business” and “keen to move into what is perceived as a significantly better business model, where fees are asset-based.” These consulting firms typically have large staffs and experience consulting on a large (multibillion dollar) scale. On the other hand, “critics assert that consultants suffer from a lack of competence as portfolio managers, and that their experience with the administration of a fund is nonexistent.” Others have raised concerns about the possibility for conflicts of interests when consultants attempt to move into the outsourced CIO business. British advisory firm Allenbridge Epic, after surveying 11 OCIOs, concluded that several lacked transparency and suffered from conflicts of interest.
Pension Investment Outsourcing.
One of the first institutional scale investment outsourcing arrangements occurred in 1986. Three investment managers who had worked for IBM’s pension fund left the company and formed SASCO Capital. They managed a portion of the IBM pension plan but IBM also kept a large portion of the assets and investment team in-house. Another early example of pension fund investment outsourcing involved General Dynamics. In November 1994 General Dynamics became the first client when its treasurer formed a new outsourced investment firm, Fiduciary Asset Management. At the time of General Dynamics’ initial allocation, this was a $2.5 billion mandate. In 2001 another of the early large pension outsourcing arrangements occurred when Xerox hired General Motors Asset Management (GMAM) to manage its $4 billion defined pension plan. This move was prompted, in part, by the departure of two senior Xerox professionals to run other investment plans. As part of the arrangement, Xerox’s chief investment officer joined GMAM. Following GM’s bankruptcy, in 2010 Xerox took back the management of its pension assets.
Other early examples of pension fund investment outsourcing included Brown & Williamson, Weyerhauser, Maytag, ADM and K-Mart. Like, the IBM, General Dynamics, and Xerox outsourcing arrangements, the Weyerhauser outsourcing in 2000 also involved moving the assets to follow a staff member. In this case, the agreement led to a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and Weyerhauser. After taking management of its pension plan back in house, Weyerhauser outsourced again in 2012 and again gave the pension assets to a former employer. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the new firm, Federal Way Asset Management, "is principally owned by a private equity fund managed by Goldberg Lindsay & Co. LLC... and management" including former Weyerhauser executive Salim Sharrif. A story published in Forbes reports that Weyerhauser "may earn royalty fees from the new money management firm." A Department of Labor filing shows that Federal Way charges Weyerhauser a 25 bps annual management fee and they believe that their second client will pay 50 bps.
In the United States, movement toward outsourcing by state, county or municipal pension plans has been slower than corporate pensions. This is despite the difficulty that many public pension funds have recruiting and retaining qualified staffs, particularly in alternatives such as hedge funds, private equity and real assets such as real estate, oil & gas and infrastructure. 
The most high profile outsourcing attempt involves the San Diego County Employees Retirement Association. The Board of Trustees hired Lee Partridge, who created a firm called Integrity Capital, as their "outsourced CIO" in 2009. The pension system kept three staff investment officers, who were in charge of the funds private market investments which totaled 30% of the fund. This arrangement sparked controversy among certain groups in San Diego. In 2010, Integrity Capital merged with Salient Partners, and Partridge and Salient continued to fulfill the original contract. In 2012, Salient won a competitive bid to continue to oversee the $9.1 billion plan. On June 5, 2014, the entirety of the San Diego investment program, including the private market assets that had been managed by investment staff, was outsourced to Salient. 
In June 2012, the San Jose Police & Fire Department Retirement Plan and the San Jose Federated City Employees' Retirement System were known to be exploring outsourcing the management of their plans. Internal research prepared for San Jose estimated that an outsourcer would charge between 30bps and 100bps to manage their $2.646 billion plan but thought it would be recovered through higher returns.
The table below presents a subsection of the list of outsourcers narrowed to focus on firms that specialize in pension outsourcing.
Beyond outsourcing, pension fund investment teams have occasionally grown to take in other, unrelated, assets. Previously the Weyerhauser/Morgan Stanley and General Motors Asset Management examples were noted. Other examples include Owens-Illinois, General Electric and American Airlines. In 1987 Owens-Illinois’ investment management subsidiary, Harbor Capital Advisors, launched five mutual funds targeting defined contribution plans. American Airlines’ AMR Investment Services (now called Beacon Funds) has its own family of mutual fund products. GE Investments offers a variety of funds to others in addition to managing mutual funds. Fiduciary Asset Management, one of the early total plan outsourcers, instead of taking on additional outsourcing clients, created a team that invests in master limited partnership and now manages nearly $4 billion in external capital. Fiduciary Asset Management was previously owned by Piper Jaffray.
Endowment Model Outsourcing.
The outsourced investment model for universities, foundations and non-profits was pioneered by Commonfund. In 1971 Commonfund was created as a result of a Ford Foundation funded study which found that small endowments chronically underperformed. More recently, the success of university endowments such as Yale, Harvard and Stanford to generate attractive returns prompted a number of former university chief investment officers to open outsourced CIO firms. These firms include (alphabetically): Agility (University of Colorado / University of Texas), Global Endowment Management (Duke Endowment and Duke University), Investure (University of Virginia), Makena Capital (Stanford University), Morgan Creek (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), Spider Management (University of Richmond), TIAA-CREF (Rice University) and Verger Capital Management (Wake Forest).
The fees charged by endowment style outsourced managers vary widely based upon a number of factors including size and complexity. In general, fees charged by endowment outsourcing managers tend to be higher than generalist outsourcers. The primary difference stems primarily from the experience and expertise that endowment-style firms usually have in areas such as hedge funds, private equity and real assets. Outsourcers that grew out of consulting firms as a general rule tend to be weak in these areas. Endowment outsourcers fees range between 35 bps and 150 bps with most groups charging an incentive fee as well. One endowment outsourcer, Global Endowment Management (GEM), in response to a request for information from San Jose Police and Fire Pension Plan, quoted their fees as follows: 0.75% on the first $100 million, 0.675% on the next $150 million, and 0.60% on all amounts above $250 million. GEM also levies a 5% incentive fee above an 8% return net of all manager fees with a high water mark. CommonFund (and its affiliates CommonFund Capital and CommonFund Asset Management), one of the true pioneers in the outsourced endowment model, quote a complex schedule of fees which they summarize this way: "Commonfund Capital’s fees for separate accounts ranges from 50-100 basis points, with varying ranges with respect to the carried interest." An analysis of CommondFund Asset Management's Form ADV Part 2 filing with the SEC for a hypothetical $1 billion account with a 50% equity allocation, 30% in hedge funds and 20% in fixed income would result in total management fees of 85 basis points plus an unspecified level of carried interest.

Gymnotrachelus

Gymnotrachelus hydei is a large selenosteid arthrodire placoderm known from the Late Famennian Cleveland Shales of Ohio. It was originally reconstructed as physically resembling "Selenosteus", with slightly smaller orbits (i.e., having a broad, box-like head). Later specimens lead to a reappraisal, and now "G. hydei" is thought to have a more gar-like or barracuda-like build.

Undun (song)

"Undun" is a popular song by Canadian rock band The Guess Who. It spent two weeks at #21 on the Canadian Singles Chart in November–December 1969, and reached #22 on the Billboard Hot 100.
It was written by Randy Bachman after hearing Bob Dylan's "Ballad in Plain D", which included the phrase "she was easily undone." Bachman's song tells the story of a girl whom he had seen at a party who slipped into a coma after dropping acid. The song structure is based around new jazz guitar chords Bachman had learned from his friend and neighbor Lenny Breau. Bachman's former bandmate Burton Cummings, during The Guess Who's 2000 reunion tour, Running Back Thru Canada, declared the song to be one of Bachman's finest compositions and "one of the best songs ever written by any Canadian songwriter". Bachman himself has stated that "Undun" is his favorite song from his time as a member of The Guess Who. 
The original 4:17 version of Undun, complete with a country guitar section at the end, appeared on The Guess Who's 1969 album, "Canned Wheat", and was initially released as the B-side of the single "Laughing" which peaked on August 23, 1969. The song was subsequently released as a 3:26 single (omitting the country guitar section) after it gained popularity when disk jockeys started turning the "Laughing" record over.
Cultural references and cover versions.
The song plays in the background of a fight scene between Robert De Niro and Bridget Fonda in Quentin Tarantino's 1997 film "Jackie Brown".
Numerous jazz and other genres' artists have covered "Undun". These include Hennie Bekker, Steve Cole, the Phil Dwyer Septet, Kurt Elling, Ranee Lee, Sophie Milman, Hugo Montenegro, and Alexander Zonjic,

Gottfried Küssel

Gottfried Küssel (born 10 September 1958) is an Austrian far right political activist who also gained some notoriety in Germany. He has been a leading figure in neo-Nazism and Holocaust denial since the 1970s.
Early years.
Born in Vienna, Küssel first became involved in politics in 1976 when he became a member of "Aktion Neue Rechte", a German New Right organisation, and by his admission joined the NSDAP/AO the following year. He was also a member of the neo-Nazi "Kameradschaft Babenberg" from 1979 until it was outlawed in April 1980 and around this time also edited the far right magazine "Halt".
Activism in Austria.
In the early 1980s Küssel undertook much work amongst football supporters, especially those of Rapid Vienna, aimed at recruiting them to the far right, in particular the "Volksbewegung", which he joined in 1982. He was arrested in 1983 and imprisoned on charges of attempting to revive Nazism. Released in 1984, Küssel was involved in a number of minor groups, notably the "Nationalen Front" and "Volkssozialistischen Partei", until in 1986 he established his own extremist movement the "Volkstreuen Außerparlamentarischen Opposition" (VAPO). A pamphlet that Küssel produced under the VAPO banner outlining his belief that Anne Frank's "The Diary of a Young Girl" was a forgery brought him to the attention of neo-Nazis in Germany and in 1987 at a gathering in Frankfurt he was recognised by his German counterparts as "Bereichsleiter Ostmark", or leader in Ostmark. 
VAPO took part in public rallies in Austria whilst also drilling members in military exercises whilst Küssel himself was interviewed on "Zick-Zack", a youth programme on ORF, during which he was identified as a neo-Nazi. He also sought to improve his international contacts, holding meetings with the likes of Gary Lauck and Michael Kühnen and in 1992 attending a conference of historical revisionists in Munich at which the likes of David Irving, Fred Leuchter, Mark Weber and Udo Walendy were leading speakers.
Cross-border leadership.
Following the death of Kühnen in 1991 Küssel joined Christian Worch and Winfried Arnulf Priem in taking control of Kühnen's final group, the "Gesinnungsgemeinschaft der Neuen Front" (GdNF). In this role he continued to be a public face of neo-Nazism whilst also organising military training for both Austrian and German activists. Having taken over as sole leader of the German Alternative he pushed that movement, which had publicly maintained a legal façade unlike the more openly militant GdNF, along a more openly violent path, resulting in it being banned in 1992. Küssel would claim that Kühnen had named him his successor on his deathbed. His public engagements included a controversial appearance on the American new programme "Nightline" during which he called Adolf Hitler the greatest man in German history and publicly denied the Holocaust, as well as an interview for Tele 5 in which he called for the re-registration of the Nazi Party as a legal political party. According to Ingo Hasselbach Küssel would also regularly lead his supporters in attacks on refugee centres whilst four of those detained after a letter bomb attack on such an establishment in Vienna in January 1992 were high profile VAPO members or supporters (although Küssel himself was not arrested in connection with this incident). Küssel had played a leading role in helping to establish neo-Nazi cells in the former East Germany in the immediate aftermath of German reunification.
Imprisonment.
In 1992, along with his ally Klaus Kopanski, Küssel was arrested at his Vienna apartment and charged again with Nazi revivalism. Found guilty the following year by the Regional Court in Vienna, he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. During his absence Austrian neo-Nazism was led by his allies Gerhard Endres in Vienna and Jürgen Lipthay in Salzburg. Küssel's imprisonment was followed by a number of bombings carried out by neo-Nazi militants using home-made bombs as a protest against the sentence. He was released from prison in 1999, receiving an early release for good behaviour.
Subsequent activity.
Although no longer in an official leadership position, Küssel has continued to be a prominent figure on the far right and has been a regular speaker at a number of neo-Nazi events, often alongside his long-term collaborator Hans-Jörg Schimanek junior. In February 2005 he was fined €360 for possessing illegal weapons after he was found to won a number of daggers and bayonets, which contravened a weapons ban placed on him in 1982.
In 2011 he was arrested in connection with investigations into Alpen-Donau.info, an Austrian neo-Nazi blog and website and on 12 December that same year he was publicly indicted for his involvement in the initiative. The trial was due to get underway in May 2012 but was twice delayed due to concerns over the jury.

William Henry Stilwell

William Henry Stilwell(May 24, 1849 – May 8, 1928) was an American jurist who served as Associate Justice on the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court from 1880 till 1882. Following his removal from the bench, he remained in the territory where he was active in Republican politics and became an expert in mining law and water rights.
Early life.
Stilwell was born on May 24, 1849 in St. Lawrence County, New York to Mary (Brazee) and James Stilwell. He was educated in public schools at Ogdensburg, New York, Gouverneur Wesleyan Seminary, and Potsdam Normal School before his graduation from the Albany Law School in 1875.
Following graduation, Stilwell moved to New York City where he worked for the legal firm of Peckham & Tremain.
Stilwell's involvement in national politics began in July 1878.
When President Rutherford B. Hayes replaced Chester A. Arthur with Edwin A. Merritt as Collector of the Port of New York, Stilwell became Merritt's assistant. In this role he acted as official secretary and also assisted the custom house's legal department.
His promotion to the bench came when President Hayes gave Stilwell a recess appointment as Associate Justice to the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. The new justice was commissioned on December 3, 1880 and arrived in the territory in February of the next year. 
Initially assigned to Prescott, at the time Chief Justice Charles G. W. French was requesting reassignment away from the southern portion of the territory. When Stilwell had no objections, the 11th Arizona Territorial Legislature granted the Chief Justice his request and assigned Stilwell to oversee Cochise, Graham, Pima, and Pinal counties. During his time on the bench Stilwell authored no legal opinions as Chief Justice French reserved this task for himself.
While on the bench, Stilwell became involved in several political disputes. As part of the efforts to force Governor John C. Frémont to either resign or return to the territory so he could perform his duties of office, Stilwell was proposed as a possible replacement. Conversely there were calls to have the judge removed from the bench. Complaints against Stilwell emphasized his supposed lack of experience and maturity. In a May 1881 letter from Tombstone attorney Thomas Fitch to Senator John Franklin Miller admitted that no specific actions justified Stilwell's removal but that the judge was still too inexperienced to remain. What importance a number of pending cases with large potential financial impact had on the call for the judges removal is unknown. The judges time on the bench came to an end on July 19, 1882 when President Chester A. Arthur nominated Wilson W. Hoover to replace Stilwell. The action was part of a mass removal that saw almost every territorial official replaced in the wake of Governor Frémont's resignation.
No reason was given for Stilwell's removal and the judge was in California recovering from an illness at time he received the news.
Following his removal, remained in Arizona and became a respected member of the legal community. He moved to Tombstone and opened a private legal practice. There he became an expert in mining law. Stilwell was a representative to the Republican territorial convention in 1888 and was elected to a two year term as Cochise County attorney beginning in January 1889.
Stilwell married Harriet Newell Bean, daughter of Southern Pacific Railroad official A. A. Bean, in 1885. The couple had three children, a son who died from an accident before reaching maturity and two daughters who reached adulthood. During their later years the couple separated with Mrs. Stilwell living in New York.
After leaving his position as Cochise County attorney in 1891, Stilwell moved to Phoenix. About this time he was also considered for appointment as a United States Attorney. In 1894 the former judge joined with Henry N. Alexander to form the legal firm of Alexander and Stilwell. With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, Stilwell was commissioned a major in the United States Army. Posted in Washington D.C. and San Francisco, California, the former judge served the paymaster department by developing a streamlined system for paying the troops. Following the war, Stilwell returned to his private legal practice.
During his legal career, Stilwell argued multiple cases in front of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court and appeared before the United States Supreme Court. While operating a general practice, his primary areas of specialization were mining law and water rights. His most influential case came when he joined with Joseph Henry Kibbey to represent the plaintiff in "Slosser v. Salt River Canal Company" (1901), 7 Arizona 376, a case that confirmed the "Kibbey Decision" that water rights belonged to the land they were associated with and not to the owner of the land.
In 1916, Stilwell lost a primary contest for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator to Kibbey by a vote of 1857 to 4775. During the Republican state convention of 1928, Stilwell became ill. By the time he returned to his Phoenix home, the illness had become pneumonia. Stilwell died on May 8, 1928 and was buried Phoenix's Greenwood Memorial Park.

In January 2003, a team of university researchers received National Science Foundation funding to create the web-based TeachEngineering.org digital library collection - populated with searchable, standards-based K-12 curricula for use by science teachers and engineering faculty to teach engineering in K-12 settings. The grant was a collaborative effort between professors in Information Systems and Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder, Duke University, Colorado School of Mines, Oregon State University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The idea was to build upon the extensive K-12 engineering curriculum already developed by four universities with National Science Foundation's GK-12 program funding, and merge the curricula from these individual sites into a unified and useful collection of free and accessible resources. The Oregon State University Open Source Lab provides hosting and system administration for the TeachEngineering website and development servers.
Motivation.
Development of the collection was motivated by the following:
Awards.
TeachEngineering has long been recognized for its high quality, receiving the National Science Digital Library 2010 Recognition of Excellence Award, and as a component of the National Academy of Engineering’s 2008 Gordon Prize.

Artur Markowicz

Artur Markowicz (1872 – 1934) was a Jewish realist painter and graphic artist born in Podgórze district of Kraków (Cracow), Poland. He is best known for his numerous pastels of street scenes in the historic Jewish town of Kazimierz – now one of the largest central districts of Kraków. His works can be found at the National Museum in Gdańsk, Kraków, Warsaw, and in other state museums in Poland and Israel.
Markowicz studied with Leopold Loeffler, Florian Cynk and with Jan Matejko at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts in 1886–1895. From 1896 until 1903 he lived and studied art in Munich, Berlin, and in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts. He also exhibited his paintings at the Salons of 1900, 1901, 1903 and 1904. Markowicz returned to Kraków in 1906 and set up a studio in Kazimierz. He traveled to Jerusalem in 1907–1908 and parts of Europe until 1914. His Jewish scenes and character-studies show a unique originality of his style influenced by symbolism with elements of expressionism. Markowicz died in Kraków in 1934 at the age of 62, and is buried at the local New Jewish Cemetery.

Critical response.
"Reincarnated" was met with generally mixed reviews from music
critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 53, based on 22 reviews. David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album two and a half stars out of five, saying "A little backstory goes a long way when it comes to this one, so fans who have seen the "Reincarnated" documentary and relate to the rapper's rebirth can go up one letter grade. Otherwise, "Reincarnated" the album is all heart and heart-in-the-right-place, threatening to mash up the system without ever even harshing the mellow." Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Rolling Stone" gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying ""Reincarnated" is Snoop's most consistently enjoyable record in years. A righteous new name wasn't all he brought home from his Jamaican pilgrimage. He also forged a creative partnership with executive producer Diplo, who serves up a tasty swirl of sticky-sweet bass lines and electro crunch. Snoop does the job with surprising grace, stretching his laid-back flow into a blissful croon. There's a winning sincerity to his sunny jams extolling peace, love and gun control; even the weed anthems feel less phoned-in than usual. It's hard not to give it up for such a big, goofy bear hug to the universe." Andy Gill of "The Independent" gave the album four out of five stars, saying "This debut offering as Snoop Lion has much to recommend it, not least the infectious grooves devised by Diplo's Major Lazer production team, an engaging blend of languid roots modes and propulsive electro methods."
Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" gave the album two out of five stars, saying "As a pop-reggae album it's patchily OK; as an addition to the canon of righteous Rastafarian spiritual music, it's profoundly unconvincing and a bit insulting. If you were Bunny Wailer, you too might get a bit cross about the reductive, cartoonish depiction of your religious beliefs. Then again, Snoop might argue, that's par for the course: he's been in the business of perpetuating cartoonish stereotypes from the start. People love them, and him, maybe more than they love his music, which has been patchy for decades. Taking that into account, they might love this. And if they don't, he can always go back to the Nine Inch Dicks." Kevin Jones of "Exclaim!" gave the album a four out of ten, saying "While the humanity and personal growth shown in Snoop Lion's "Reincarnated" documentary granted the legendary rapper some sympathetic cover for his dubious rebirth as a reggae-singing Rasta, the eponymous album at the heart of that story affords him no such luxury. The Diplo-directed record is a somewhat sloppy mish-mash of reggae cuts that rarely attain an authentic air, a couple of Rita Ora- and Miley Cyrus-assisted pop write-offs, and one bit of Major Lazer-lite, in the oddly-placed "Get Away." Brent Faulkner of PopMatters gave the album a six out of ten, saying "Uneven though sometimes enjoyable, "Reincarnated" is surprisingly better than expected. That said, the effort still stumbles into the pitfalls of a musician altering his direction and leaving his comfort zone. Snoop Lion pulls off this album off stronger than Lil Wayne did rock (Rebirth), but still, Snoop is best suited spitting over luxurious west-coast beats."
Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media gave the album a 5.0 out of ten, saying "Too much of it is an ill-advised cultural safari that's too weird to fly but too monied to fail. But where it succeeds, "Reincarnated" forces you to forget the principal ridiculousness of the enterprise, and that is no small feat." Keith Harris of "Spin" gave the album a four out of ten, saying ""Reincarnated"'s highlight is "Ashtrays and Heartbreaks," with, yes, Miley Cyrus, still in her first flush of post-teen stonerdom, sounding every bit like the sort of suburban teen was led not-quite-astray by Snoop's previous incarnation. Yet, it may just make you feel sad for the minors of the future to whose delinquency Snoop will have nothing to contribute." Patricia Meschino of "Billboard" gave the album a 7.5 out of ten, saying ""Reincarnated" stands as an enjoyable pop record laced with an assortment of roots and dancehall reggae references. Its sprinkling of Rasta ideology has, laudably, redirected Snoop's gangsta lyrical exploits towards enriching themes such as ending gang wars and curbing gun violence." Omar Burgess of HipHopDX gave the album three out of five stars, saying "The road to discounted and discarded albums is paved with good intentions. Listeners fortunate enough to get the complete "Reincarnated" experience saw both Snoop’s moving documentary and got a brief taste of the music as well. Sadly, the album in and of itself doesn’t offer that similar window into Snoop’s evolution. Snoop Lion has transcended Hip Hop and possibly music in general. He’s courting some listeners who had either yet to be born or were too young to remember exactly what he’s being reincarnated from."
Commercial performance.
The album debuted at number 16 on the "Billboard" 200 chart, with first-week sales of 21,000 copies in the United States. In its second week the album sold 8,600 more copies. In its third week the album sold 4,700 more copies. In its fourth week the album sold 2,900 more copies. As of June 26, 2013 the album has sold 50,000 copies in the United States.

Fort Longueuil

Fort Longueuil was a stone fort that stood in Longueuil, Canada from 1690 to 1810.
Fort Longueuil was recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada on May 25, 1923. The historic site includes the archaeological site of the fort, which was demolished in 1810. The site extends beneath the present-day Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue Cathedral.
History.
The territory of New France was divided into seigneuries in order to ensure the colony's defence. Of these seigneuries, Charles Le Moyne was granted the "Seigneury of Longueuil". His son, Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil, built a fort with four towers between 1685 and 1690 as his fortified residence. The fort was built entirely in stone masonry, and included a guard house, a chapel and corps de logis. 
Louis de Buade de Frontenac and Jean Bochart de Champigny then asked King Louis XIV to erect the seigneury of Longueuil as a barony, which he did in 1700, establishing the Barony of Longueuil. Charles Le Moyne de Longueuil was the only Canadian-born person to be raised to the rank of Baron by a French King. 
Fort Longueuil was believed to be occupied by American troops during the American Revolutionary War. It was subsequently occupied by the British. It was demolished in 1810 because of its poor condition.
Location.
The fort was located in the Old Longueuil neighbourhood. It was partly situated on the site of the Co-Cathedral of Saint-Antoine-de-Padoue, Saint-Charles Street, Chambly Road, the site of a Laurentian Bank branch and a restaurant.
Description.
It measured 68 meters long by 46 meters wide. The interior of the fort included:

It is located near Campbell Bay, on Great Nicobar island in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. It is the southernmost air station of the Indian Armed Forces. It overlooks the Strait of Malacca as well as the Six Degree channel between Great Nicobar and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
History.
INS Baaz was commissioned by the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Nirmal Kumar Verma on July 31, 2012. It is the first air station in the Nicobar Islands, situated on the Great Nicobar island in the remotest and southernmost part of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and lies very close to the Six Degree channel, a vital choke point. The commissioning of the air station will facilitate positioning of maritime reconnaissance aircraft and helicopters of ANC and also facilitate the Civil Administration to operate regular intra-island sorties. The Naval air station will provide requisite logistic, communication and administrative support for various aircraft undertaking surveillance, patrolling missions and maritime air operations. The strategically located INS Baaz will enable India to extend its reach in the eastern Indian Ocean region.
Commander SK Singh Deo is the first commanding officer of INS Baaz. INS Baaz will initially be used as a base for the Indian Navy's Dornier Do 228 reconnaissance aircraft. It can also operate the Indian Air Force's C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft. Its runway measures and will be progressively lengthened to enable all heavy aircraft to operate from the base.

The Lutheran Evangelical Church in Italy ("Chiesa Evangelica Luterana in Italia", "Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Italien", abbreviated CELI or ELKI) is a Lutheran church in Italy, founded in 1949. The CELI, which includes both German- and Italian-speaking communities, is a member of the Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy (FCEI) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF).
The first Lutheran community in Italy was formed in Venice in 1650. Within the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Lutheran churches were formed in Trieste (1778), Merano (1861) and Bolzano (1889). Under Prussian influence, communities were formed also in Rome (1819), Naples (1826) and Florence (1899), while other German-speaking citizens established churches in Milano (1850), Sanremo (1870) and Genoa (1896). Lutheranism flourished in Naples and Torre Annunziata thanks to the missionary work of pastor Idelmo Poggioli. All the aforementioned communities were gathered in the CELI in 1949 or afterwards. In 1967 the CELI was a founding member of the FCEI. Under the CELI's supervision, other churches were formed, notably in Catania (1991), Verona (2008) and Turin (2009).
The CELI consists of 17 communities, some of which cover entire regions, and more than 7,000 baptized members.

Max Truex

Max Edwin Truex (b. November 4, 1935 Warsaw, Indiana, d. March 24, 1991 Milton, Massachusetts) was an American long distance runner. He was a two-time Olympian, running the 10,000 metres at the 1956 and 1960 Olympics. He also was a two-time United States champion in the 6 mile run, the imperial equivalent and added a 3 mile championship in 1962 (though he actually finished second to New Zealander Murray Halberg). The diminutive 5' 5" Truex was called a seemingly tireless running machine.
While running for Warsaw High School, Truex came to fame by setting the national high school record in the mile at 4:20.4, the record that had been held by Louis Zamperini for close to 20 years. He went to the University of Southern California where he joined the Air Force ROTC. He won the 1957 NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship and on the track set the NCAA 2 mile record. While at USC he won his first AAU National Championship and the 1956 Olympic Trials. But the college sophomore went to the Olympics injured and was unable to finish his race. At the Fresno Relays he added the American record in the 5,000 metres at 14:14.5, setting the 3 mile record at 13:47.6 along the way. The race was perhaps all the more notable because he had to weave through 47 competitors on the same track. Three weeks later in Compton, California he knocked ten seconds off the mark. That mark still ranks him #2 time on the USC all time list. By the time he graduated he was already in the Air Force at the Oxnard Air Force Base, where Olympian Bob Schul and world record holder Eddie Southern were also training. 
He became part of the Southern California Striders, a dominant track team of this period. His second national championship in 1959 qualified him to run in the 1959 Pan American Games. In 1960, he won the Olympic trials, then finished 6th in the Olympics. In 1962, Truex won the national championships in the 3 mile run. This qualified him to run in the USA-USSR dual meet, the biggest meet of the year. During that race, he developed a 2 inch blood blister. He tried to heal it for a year with no success. He finally retired and returned to USC to get his law degree.
At the age of 40, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. The disease deteriorated his quality of life rapidly. He had to retire early, eventually seeking unconventional fetal brain transplant surgery in China. He died at the age of 55.

Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths in the UK

The Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) was previously known as the Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH). As of 2012, this organisation has produced 8 reports on the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the UK. The reports, each covering a three-year period, used to be called "Why Mothers Die", until 2008 when the title was changed to "Saving Mothers Lives".
The eighth report was published in March 2011 and covers a period from 2006 - 2008 in the UK. It is over 200 pages long. It covers recommendations and guidelines, a 'back to basics' section highlighting key points of good perinatal care practice, and also covers public health issues that contribute to inequality of maternal outcomes between socioeconomic groups. For every cause of death, there is a detailed chapter on risk factors, patterns of events, and a judgement on the prevalence of substandard care, followed by specific conclusions and advice. For each profession involved in the care of pregnant women, (e.g. Midwifery, General Practice, Emergency Medicine), there is a chapter on lessons to be learnt.
The ninth report will cover not only the United Kingdom, but also the Republic of Ireland in its scope.
The philosophy of CMACE is to recognise every maternal death as a young woman who died before her time and to use the lessons to save future mothers and babies.
Findings of the Eighth Report.
Mortality Rate.
The total number of maternities for 2006 - 2008 in the UK was 2 291 493. (A maternity is any pregnancy resulting in livebirth, or stillbirths occurring at or after 24 weeks of gestation)
The total number of deaths caused directly by pregnancy was 107. A further 154 mothers died of other causes that were aggravated by pregnancy (indirect deaths)
In the three-year period from 2006 - 2008, for every 100,000 maternities, there were 4.67 maternal deaths directly resulting from complications of the pregnant state. This is a significant reduction for the first time in recent years. For every 100,000 maternities, there were 1.13 deaths from sepsis. This is an increase, and community acquired Group A streptococcal disease was prominent. There were fewer deaths from thromboembolism than in the previous report.
In this three-year period, for every 100,000 maternities, there were 6.72 maternal deaths from conditions not caused by pregnancy, but aggravated by the pregnant state (E.g. heart disease, or suicide)
Note that the internationally defined maternal mortality ratio is the number of direct and indirect deaths per 100,000 livebirths. Not all other countries benefit from such accurate recording of live births or maternal deaths. The Office for National Statistics reported UK maternal mortality rates are lower than in the CMACE report due to the simplicity of the information recorded on death certificates.
Public Health.
Women with partners who were unemployed or employment unclassified were nearly 6 times more likely to die than those with partners in employment, but this is less inequality than there has been in the past.
Back to Basics.
This section of the report contains lists of "red flag" signs and symptoms, and a differential diagnosis for some of the more common symptoms and syndromes occurring during pregnancy. i.e. Sore throat, Sepsis, Breathlessness, Abdominal pain, Diarrhoea and vomiting, Headache.
It also emphasises again communication between different health care professionals, and effective referral to specialist services

Opera dei Pupi

The Opera dei Pupi (Opera of the Puppets; Sicilian: Òpira rî pupi) is a marionette theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems such as the Song of Roland or "Orlando furioso" that is one of the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theaters featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of "cantastorî" (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of Palermo, Sicily.
The Sicilian marionette theater Opera dei pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.
Today, there are only a few troupes that maintain the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionnettists, such as the Greco of Palermo; the Canino of Cinisi; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of Catania, Pennisi and Macri of Acireale, Profeta of Licata, Gargano and Grasso of Agrigento. One can, however, admire the richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino and at the Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitrè in Palermo. Other beautiful marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in Randazzo.

Lorenzo Imperiali

Lorenzo Imperiali (21 February 1612 - 21 September 1673) was an Italian Catholic cardinal.
Early life.
Imperiali was born in Genoa on 21 February 1612 to the patrician Imperiali family of that city.
He went to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Urban VIII and was appointed vice-legate in Bologna and governor of Fano and Ascoli. During the absence of Cardinal Antonio Barberini he was appointed legate in Ferrara. He was later appointed cleric of the Apostolic Chamber.
During the Wars of Castro, Imperiali was appointed governor of those provinces of the State of Castro under the control of the papacy and was appointed commissary-general of the papal army. He was later sent by Pope Innocent X to Fermo to put down the uprising that had cost the life of its governor in 1648.
Pope Innocent appointed Imperiali governor of Rome between 1653 and 1654
Ecclesiastic career.
Before appointing Imperiali governor, the pope elevated him to cardinal but the elevation was reserved "in pectore" until Imperiali stepped down as governor in 1654; his cardinalate was published in the consistory of 2 March 1654 and he was appointed cardinal-priest of the Church of San Crisogono.
He participated in the papal conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII.
In 1660 he was again named governor of Rome by Pope Alexander. Contemporary John Bargrave recounts that while he was governor, François, Duke of Créquy and ambassador of France, visited Rome with his wife. A grave misunderstanding led to the ambassador's coach being attacked and fired upon by papal troops (from Corsica).
As punishment, Imperiali was transferred as legate to the newly created legation in the province of the Marches. Later he resigned his legation and went to Paris to explain his conduct to King Louis XIV of France.
Imperiali participated in the papal conclave of 1667 which elected Pope Clement IX and the conclave of 1669-1670 which elected Pope Innocent XI. During these conclaves, Imperiali was a senior member of the liberal movement "Squadrone Volante". It is thought the group engineered the election of Giulio Rospigliosi as Pope Clement in 1667.
Imperiali died on 21 September 1673 in Rome and was buried in the chapel of Saint Thomas of Villanova in the Basilica di Sant'Agostino.

<doc id="36602850" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36602850" title="Glaucoma medication">
Glaucoma medication

The goal of currently available glaucoma therapy is to preserve visual function by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) below a level that is likely to produce further damage to the nerve. The treatment regimen that achieves this goal with the lowest risk, fewest adverse effects, and least disruption of the patient's life, taking into account the cost implications of treatment, should be the one employed.
The more advanced the glaucomatous process on initial presentation, the lower the target range generally needs to be to prevent further progression. This more aggressive target is meant to minimize the risk of progressive glaucoma damage and vision loss. Once the optic nerve is damaged, it is more likely to incur more damage, and if severe visual loss is present, there is greater impact on the patient from any additional damage that may occur.
An initial reduction in the IOP of 20% from baseline is suggested. However, reduction of IOP to the target pressure range does not guarantee that progression will not occur. Therefore, the target pressure range needs to be constantly reassessed and changed as dictated by IOP fluctuations, optic nerve changes, and/or visual field progression.
Medications are divided into several groups based on chemical structure and pharmacologic action. Agents in common clinical use include:

Roskilde Gymnasium is a gymnasium (upper secondary school) in central Roskilde, Denmark. It is based in the historical premises of Roskilde Cathedral School, facing the square in front of Roskilde Cathedral. The school has 900 students and 90 teachers and a wide variety of study programs.
History.
Roskilde Cathedral School was established in the grounds outside Roskilde Cathedral as far back as 1020. in the 1960s it had outgrown its campus which could not be expanded due to the historical surroundings and it therefore moved to a new site on Holbækvej in Hyrdehøj in 1969. Roskilde Municipality established a temporary school in the old buildings and in 1979 it was taken over by Copenhagen County under the name "Roskilde Amtsgymnasium". The school was taken over in 2007 when the Danish counties were abolished in the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform and changed its name to Roskilde Gymnasium.
Campus.
The main building facing the cathedral square is from 1842 and was designed by Jørgen Hansen Koch in the Neoclassical style but integrates medieval parts. It has later been expanded several times. Most recently, a new Science Centre has been built in the so-called Latin Garden in 2012.

Criticism of Comcast

Many different controversies and criticisms have surrounded Comcast for various reasons over its recent history.
NFL Network.
On November 10, 2006, Comcast announced it would add NFL Network on digital tiers in time for the eight-game Thursday- and Saturday-night package. In August 2007 Comcast moved NFL Network from the digital tiers to the "Sports Entertainment Package". This led to a lawsuit between NFL Network and Comcast, with the ruling in favor of Comcast. Comcast sent NFL Network a cease-and-desist letter to stop encouraging subscribers to leave Comcast. Comcast's agreement with the NFL Network ended in mid-2009. In February 2008 an appellate court in New York reversed field on a judgment made in May 2007 that allowed Comcast to move the network from its second most distributed tier to the company's sports tier. The New York’s Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, ruled the language "concerning "additional programming package" was ambiguous and that "neither party has established that its interpretation of the relevant contracts is a matter of law.""
NFL Network later filed a discrimination case against Comcast with the FCC, claiming that since Comcast doesn't charge extra for its owned and operated sports channels Versus (now NBC Sports Network) and The Golf Channel, it's unfair to charge extra for NFL Network. On October 10, 2008, the FCC ruled as follows:
"In the Second Report and Order, the Commission emphasized that the statute “does not explicitly prohibit multichannel distributors from acquiring a financial interest or exclusive rights that are otherwise permissible,” and thus, that “multichannel distributors negotiate for, but not insist upon such benefits in exchange for carriage on their systems.” The Commission stated, however, that “ultimatums, intimidation, conduct that amounts to exertion of pressure beyond good faith negotiations, or behavior that is tantamount to an unreasonable refusal to deal with a vendor who refuses to grant financial interests or exclusivity rights for carriage, should be considered examples of behavior that violates the prohibitions set forth in Section 616.” We find that the NFL has presented sufficient evidence to make a prima facie showing that Comcast indirectly and improperly demanded a financial interest in the NFL’s programming in exchange for carriage. We further find that the pleadings and documentation present several factual disputes as to whether Comcast’s retiring of the NFL Network is the result of Comcast’s failure to obtain a financial interest in the NFL’s programming. Accordingly, we direct an Administrative Law Judge to hold a hearing, issue a recommended decision on the facts underlying the financial interest claim and a recommended remedy, if necessary, and then return the matter to the Commission within 60 days."
FCC program access complaint.
Comcast's trial about the NFL Network's program access complaint with the FCC began on April 14, 2009. At issue was whether Comcast's placement of the NFL Network on a digital sports tier ("Sports Entertainment Package") represented discrimination prevented by the 1992 Cable Act.
In April 2009, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts testified that Comcast was willing to move the channel from the Sports Entertainment Package to a lower priced base package if the subscriber fee was reduced to 25 cents per month. NFL Network charged 75¢ per month. He claimed Comcast saves $50 million a year in license fees by leaving the channel on its Sports Package, which leads to savings for its customers. On May 19, 2009 it was announced that a deal had been reached to move the channel to its "Digital Classic" tier.
Low customer satisfaction levels.
In 2004 and 2007, the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey found that Comcast had the worst customer satisfaction rating of any company or government agency in the country, including the Internal Revenue Service. The ACSI indicates that almost half of all cable customers (regardless of company) have registered complaints, and that cable is the only industry to score below 60 in the ACSI. Comcast's Customer Service Rating by the ACSI surveys indicate that the company's customer service has never improved since the surveys began in 2001. Analysis of the surveys states that "Comcast is one of the lowest scoring companies in ACSI. As its customer satisfaction eroded by 7% over the past year, revenue increased by 12%." The ACSI analysis also addresses this contradiction, stating that "Such pricing power usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level. This also means that a cable company can do well financially even though its customers are not particularly satisfied." In 2009 Comcast rebounded on its ACSI rating for television and Internet services, moving ahead of Charter Communications and into a tie with Time Warner Cable.
Within the Cable Television needs assessment report for the city of Fort Collins, Colorado, February 10, 2004 which was required for Comcast's franchise renewal the city's independent consultant found:<br>
"Approximately 62% of the respondents, though, were very dissatisfied (along with another 25% who were dissatisfied) with the cost of cable television service."<br>
"A majority of the respondents were satisfied with the friendliness and courtesy of customer service personnel. Overall, approximately 43% of the respondents rated the cable company's performance as fair, 30% regarded it as poor and another 30% rated the cable company's performance as good."
While Comcast does operate some of its own customer service call centers, it also outsources customer service and some technical support to Convergys Inc and until recently Transcom WorldWide, both third party call center companies.
On October 1, 2008, J.D. Power and Associates published its annual customer satisfaction survey for the nation's top 10 largest cable and satellite television providers. Comcast scored in the bottom 5 for each region of the United States, including 10th in the East Region. One of the largest internet based consumer-review services, Rateitall.com reports the average consumer review of Comcast as 1.7 out of 5 stars, based on a total of 409 reviews to date (2010).
Comcast has made efforts to improve customer satisfaction, including the Comcast Cares Digital Team. The Comcast Cares Digital Team began when then Customer Service Manager Frank Eliason decided Twitter would be an ideal way to communicate with customers. Those efforts did not go unnoticed. In 2010, @ComcastBonnie won the Customer Service category at the 2010 Shorty Awards. 
Customer service after Hurricane Ike.
Shortly after Hurricane Ike hit the Galveston, Texas area in 2008, customers received bills and later collection notices for unreturned equipment that was destroyed during the storm. One customer reported a $931 bill which included a $66 credit for interrupted phone service, but also included a $1000 charge for not returning her rented DVR, Cable Modem, and other equipment. Comcast responses differed after the storm, with some Customer Care agents telling customers to file with their insurance providers, and other agents advising customers to return their equipment, even if it was ruined or moldy.
Network neutrality.
In 2006, Comcast implemented measures using Sandvine hardware which sends forged TCP RST (reset) packets, disrupting multiple protocols used by peer-to-peer file sharing networks. This prevented most Comcast users from uploading files.
In August 2007, TorrentFreak reported that Comcast had been preventing BitTorrent users from seeding files. In October 2007, the Associated Press reported that Comcast "actively interferes with attempts by some of its high-speed Internet subscribers to share files online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally." In November 2007, Comcast's limiting of torrent applications was confirmed by a study conducted by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in which public domain literature is distributed over peer-to-peer networks. Analysis of the EFF study found "strong evidence that Comcast is using packet-forging to disrupt peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing on their network". The studies showed that Comcast prevents distribution of files over peer-to-peer networks by sending a RST packet under the guise of the end user, and denying the connection, which effectively blocks the user from seeding over BitTorrent. Legal controversy arises because instead of simple filtering, Comcast is sending RST packets to Comcast customers, pretending to be the host user at the other end of the BitTorrent connection. Comcast's BitTorrent throttling is a partnership with Sandvine.
Comcast uses RST packets on groupware applications that have nothing to do with file sharing. A Lotus Notes messaging engineer noticed strange behavior with Lotus Notes dropping emails when hooked up to a Comcast connection and verified Comcast's reset packets are the culprit. A lawsuit, "Hart v. Comcast", was filed accusing Comcast of false advertising and other unfair trade practices for allegedly advertising unlimited high-speed Internet access while working to restrict their customers' usage of the Internet.
In 2007, Comcast customers reported a sporadic inability to use Google Search, because forged RST packets interfered with HTTP access to google.com, which has further angered users.
In January 2008, the FCC announced that it would investigate complaints that Comcast "actively interferes with Internet traffic as its subscribers try to share files online". Comcast admitted they paid people to hold seats to “pack” the 25 February 2008 FCC hearing. The FCC stated it expected to rule on the issue by June 30, 2008. Comcast and BitTorrent Inc. agreed in late March 2008 to work together in a collaborative effort that will leave the network provider to reconfigure its network to manage traffic in a more protocol-agnostic way. Implementation was projected for late 2008.
Prior to implementation of Comcast's agreements with BitTorrent, Inc., Comcast was continuing to limit bandwidth available to peer to peer applications. In April 2008, Comcast proposed a "P2P Bill of Rights and Responsibilities" to address potential copyright infringement by users of peer to peer applications, but some argued that this is an attempt by Comcast to strengthen its traffic management capability rather than fight copyright infringement.
In August 2008 the FCC stated that Comcast's network management was unreasonable and that Comcast must terminate the use of its discriminatory network management by the end of the year. (File no: EB-08-IH-1518). On January 18, 2009, after reconfiguring their traffic management regime, Comcast was asked by the FCC to address their alleged throttling of VoIP customers. Comcast complied with the order and appealed. On June 6, 2010, the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the order in Comcast Corp. v. FCC.
Netflix.
There is a current ongoing dispute about access to Netflix from inside the Comcast network.
"On November 19, 2010, Comcast informed Level 3 that, for the first time, it will demand a recurring fee from Level 3 for additional bandwidth, to keep up with unprecedented customer demand, to transmit Internet online movies and other content to Comcast's customers who request such content, in order to cover infrastructure costs." Level 3 asked Comcast for an additional 200 Gbit/s access to their network at no additional cost, that would offset the long-standing contract between the two companies that as long as each uses roughly the same amount of bandwidth of each other's services, that neither would be charged. Comcast has given Level 3 increased bandwidth while they try to work out the details.
This has caused over 110,000 people to sign a petition.
TechTV acquisition.
Comcast announced on March 25, 2004 that its new gaming-oriented television network G4 (operated by subsidiary G4 Media, Inc.) would acquire Vulcan Venture's technology-oriented television network TechTV. The deal was finalized on May 10, 2004 and the two networks became G4techTV on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world. On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV. On February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as G4 – Video Game Television. Since then, G4 has gone through a rebranding into a male oriented network.
This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and its well known personality Leo Laporte. Around May 6, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles, California, if they agreed to relocate there. With the departure of ZDTV-era employee Adam Sessler in April 2012, Morgan Webb is currently the sole TechTV-era employee remaining with the network. Comcast also acquired 33.33% of G4 Canada in addition to its U.S. channel in the sale of TechTV.
Lobbying efforts.
Comcast spends millions of dollars annually on government relationships. Comcast employs the spouses, sons and daughters of mayors, councilmen, commissioners, and other officials to assure its continued preferred market allocations.
Comcast occasionally lobbies against "à la carte" bills that would give consumers the option to purchase individual channels rather than a broad tier of programming. Although they claim the reason for this is to keep customer costs lower, these issues continue to garner attention from state governments, the United States Congress and former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin J. Martin.
The FCC's decision to sanction Comcast for its 2007 P2P blocking was overruled on April 6, 2010 by the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The question before the court was whether the FCC had the legal authority to "regulate an Internet service provider's network management practice." According to a three-judge panel, "the Commission has failed to make that showing" and the FCC's order against Comcast is tossed.
HDTV claim and quality.
Comcast has started transmitting three HD channels per Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) carrier, rather than two per QAM like some other video service providers. Though more cost effective, this additional compression has been noticed and measured by some customers as a reduction in the quality of broadcasts. Comcast claims to have more HD choices than DirecTV by including Comcast's on-demand and pay-per-view assets. Each HD on-demand program is counted as a so-called HD "choice" by Comcast.
Signal intrusion and accidental transmission of pornography.
On May 1, 2007, during a broadcast of the preschool program "Handy Manny", Comcast had briefly replaced the program on Disney Channel's cable channel assignment with hard-core pornography for subscribers in Lincroft, New Jersey. Comcast's response to the complaints that ensued from the incident claimed that "We are continuing to investigate the root cause of the incident." A spokesperson for Disney Channel said in a statement "We value the trust that parents have in Disney Channel and our programming... and certainly take [Tuesday's] regrettable programming disruption in New Jersey extremely seriously."
On February 7, 2008, Comcast subscribers in Nashville, Tennessee also saw pornography via the cable provider on Cartoon Network. The incident, which happened in the early morning hours, was broadcast for at least an hour. Vice president of Nashville's Comcast provider, John Gauder apologized and stated "We apologize for any inconvenience some of our Comcast cable TV customers in Middle Tennessee experienced Thursday as a result of some highly unusual issues ... It appears that a subscription movie channel was inadvertently shown on other channels which normally carry news, sports, children's and other entertainment programming… We are taking the appropriate steps to ensure that this highly unusual incident does not happen again." Comcast said that engineers thought they had fixed the glitch which occurred on multiple cable channels at midnight earlier that night, but the error reappeared at around 4 a.m., when the cable company decided to remove the channels from the lineup.
On February 1, 2009 during Super Bowl XLIII, Comcast's transmission of NBC affiliate KVOA (channel 4) in Tucson, Arizona was interrupted for approximately 20 seconds replacing the telecast of the game via NBC (which was not owned by Comcast at the time) with soft-core porn from the adult pay-per-view channel Shorteez. This accidental display affected Comcast's analog cable subscribers in parts of the Tucson area. The substitution appears to have been made at Comcast, not at KVOA, leaving KVOA's over-the-air, satellite and other cable providers viewers unaffected. Also, Comcast's high-definition transmission of KVOA was not affected. Comcast launched an investigation on the incident with the FBI stating that it was an "isolated, malicious act". Comcast also offered to give a $10 credit to any customers who say they viewed the approximately 30-second clip. In October 2011, Frank Tanori Gonzalez, a former Cox Communications employee, admitted that he was responsible for the porn clip. He was ordered to serve three years probation and pay $1,000 in damages.
DNS redirection.
Comcast turned on a DNS redirection function for its Internet customers by default. When customers accidentally typed a non-existent Web address in their browser, they were then redirected to a Comcast search page saying the page was not found and offering alternatives. Comcast called this option "Domain Helper" and gave customers an option to disable it. Comcast later announced that DNS redirection was incompatible with DNSSEC, which was a priority for the company. Their DNSSEC deployment began in 2011 and as users were migrated to DNSSEC-validating servers, Domain Helper no longer was used. As of January 10, 2012, "Domain Helper" was retired when the last Comcast users were migrated to DNSSEC-validating servers. Comcast was the first ISP in the United States to fully implement DNSSEC, having both signed all of their domain names and turned on validation on all of their DNS servers. Comcast also announced that these DNSSEC-validating servers were all natively IPv6-enabled.

Anti-aging supplements

Anti-aging supplements are a set of products that often include powdered supplements, skin creams, vitamins, and facial masks. They are designed to reduce or diminish the effects of aging. Many products seek to hide the effects of aging while others claim to alter the body's chemical balances to slow the physical effects of aging. A comprehensive grading scale for anti-aging of the skin has been validated and categorizes skin aging as: laxity (sagging), rhytids (wrinkles), and the various categories of photoaging, including erythema (redness), dyspigmentation (brown discolorations), solar elastosis (yellowing), keratoses (abnormal growths), and poor texture.
Despite great demand, many such products and treatments have not been proven to give lasting or major positive effects. One study found that the best performing creams reduced wrinkles by less than 10% over 12 weeks which is not noticeable to the human eye. Another study found that cheap moisturisers were as effective as high-priced anti-wrinkle creams. However, recent studies at Manchester University showed that some ingredients have an effect.
Traditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are increasingly common.
Skepticism.
The belief in the benefits of anti-aging creams, along with their use, should be met with skepticism. Nearly every brand and type delivers information about the product being “scientifically tested” or “scientifically proven” however, the results of these studies are rarely made available to consumers. This suggests that the legitimacy of these studies and subsequent results are highly questionable.
Aging is a natural process which is accompanied by normal physical, chemical, and biological changes in the body. These changes include facial and body wrinkling of the skin and this process is common to all human beings. To believe so easily that a cream could prevent and/or reduce the process of skin aging all on its own does not fit with how the world really works. If this problem had such a simple solution, individuals (including our ancestors) would likely have perfect complexions free of age-related problems. Similarly, if the solution to anti-aging was so easy for us to attain, there would be no need for hundreds or thousands of products on the commercial market which provide similar claims yet produce products with differing ingredients.
Theoretically, cosmetics promise to alter or “enhance” function, however they do not change any cellular or biochemical reactions or processes within the skin. Secondly, these products and chemicals are unregulated by any governing body, thus allowing potentially dangerous or harmful ingredients to be added with the promise of results. Before blindly accepting that certain chemicals cause anti-aging results, it is necessary to do research to determine the safety of these products.
Ingredients.
As well as more conventional moisturising ingredients, anti-aging creams usually contain anti-aging ingredients such as:
The effects of these ingredients depends on their concentration and mode of application. Many skin care companies recommend using a treatment program which may combine these ingredients. For example, AHAs can make the skin more vulnerable to damage from the sun, so the increased use of sunscreens is often recommended.
Alternative approaches.
Traditional moisturisers or sunscreens may provide many of the same benefits as some anti-aging creams.
Mechanical exfoliation is an alternative to chemical peels using ingredients such as crushed apricot kernels, salt, sponges or brushes.
Advertising sometimes presents anti-aging creams as an alternative to plastic surgery and Botox injections, which may be more costly and invasive treatments.
Another potential for anti-aging is from within. Resveratrol and Rapamycin are forefront anti-aging drugs that are currently being tested in human trials.

Eddy Rodríguez (catcher)

Eddy Rodríguez (born December 1, 1985) is a Cuban professional baseball catcher in the Tampa Bay Rays organization. He played in Major League Baseball for the San Diego Padres in 2012.
Rodríguez's family defected from Cuba on his father's fishing boat when he was eight years old, nearly dying on the journey. Rodríguez played college baseball for the University of Miami before beginning his professional career.
Biography.
Rodríguez and his family lived in Villa Clara Province, Cuba. Rodríguez's family defected from Cuba when he was eight years old on his father's fishing boat. Their boat nearly capsized in a storm and they ran out of food, resorting to eating ground coffee beans, before they were discovered by the United States Coast Guard. The family settled in Miami and Rodríguez graduated from Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral Gables, Florida.
Rodríguez received a scholarship from the University of Miami, where he played college baseball as the starting catcher for the Miami Hurricanes baseball team. The Cincinnati Reds drafted Rodríguez in the 20th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft. He played in the Reds minor league baseball organization until 2009, reaching Class AA with the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League, when he began playing independent league baseball. Rodríguez played in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball for the El Paso Diablos in 2009 and the Sioux Falls Pheasants in 2010.
In 2011, Rodríguez returned to organized baseball when he signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres. He was promoted to the Padres on August 1, 2012 from the Lake Elsinore Storm of the Class A-Advanced California League, after starting catcher Yasmani Grandal was placed on the disabled list.
Rodríguez made his Major League debut on August 2, 2012 against the Cincinnati Reds. He hit a home run off of Johnny Cueto in his first major league at-bat. Rodríguez made two starts for the Padres in 2012, going 1 for 5 at the plate. He was optioned to the Triple-A Tucson Padres on August 9 when opening-day catcher Nick Hundley was recalled.
On September 4, 2012 Rodríguez was designated for assignment and moved off the 40-man roster. The Padres re-signed Rodríguez as a minor-league free agent and invited him to 2013 spring training.
Rodríguez signed a minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays in January 2014.

Moment space surveillance complex

Moment (, from , meaning in ) is a Russian military space surveillance complex. It is used to monitor radio emissions from space craft and satellites, a form of electronic intelligence gathering. It is run by the Russian Aerospace Defence Forces as part of their 821st Main Space Intelligence Centre (SKKP) which operates the space surveillance network. It was put into service for experimental combat duty in 2003. 
Moment originated with the Russian military company Vympel. They published a draft design for the system in 1989, along with other space surveillance technologies, including the Krona space object recognition station and the Laser Optical Locator. Work on the Moment complex itself started in 1991. Moment's design work was done by Experimental Design Bureau MEI () under lead designer K. A. Pobedonostsev. MEI was founded as part of the Moscow Power Engineering Institute and undertakes work on antennae, telemetry and other radio and space related technologies. It is part of the JSC Russian Space Systems. Their work on Moment was done under contract to Vympel. 
Moment was put into experimental combat duty on 20 March 2003, and as of 2012 has yet to be formally commissioned. It works passively, picking up radio transmissions from spacecraft and satellites which it can use to locate them, and to discern other things about them. MEI have produced similar systems such as the civilian RIDM.
Moment has been installed somewhere in the Moscow Oblast, and is moveable. It may be co-located with the Centre for Space Monitoring at Noginsk-9. It has the GRAU index 14G6 (14Г6)

Pietro-Micca-class submarine

Pietro Micca (pennant number MC) was an Italian submarine which served with the Regia Marina in World War II. She was the second ship named after Pietro Micca, the Savoyard soldier who became a national hero for his sacrifice in the defence of Turin against the French troops in 1706. This boat was the prototype for a class of fast, long range submarines with conventional torpedo armament, naval mine laying capability, and useful secret transport capacity. The ship was built at the Tosi shipyard in Taranto. She was laid down on 15 October 1931 and launched on 31 March 1935. The boat fully met design requirements, but was too expensive to be repeated.
Career.
"Micca" was delivered to the Navy on 1 October 1935. The boat undertook two Spanish Civil War patrols in support of Francisco Franco on 23 January and 13 February 1937. As the largest "Regia Marina" submarine, "Micca" led the submarine fleet for the 5 May 1938 Naples naval parade to honor Adolf Hitler. "Micca" was at sea when Italy declared war, and laid a minefield off Alexandria on 12 June 1940. "Micca" returned to lay a second minefield off Alexandria on 12 August 1940. Italy kept "Micca" in the Mediterranean Sea despite "Kriegsmarine" requests for temporary assignment to BETASOM to assist minelaying at Freetown, Cape Town, and Madagascar. Transport of food, gasoline and ammunition to the Aegean Sea and North Africa became her primary mission by the end of 1940; and "Micca" transported a total of 2,163 tons of essential cargo in 14 resupply missions before being torpedoed by southwest of Cape Santa Maria di Leuca at 06:05 on 29 July 1943. There were 18 survivors.

Gače

Gače (; , Gottscheerish: "Gatschn") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Semič in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Komarna Vas and it is registered as a cultural heritage site.
Name.
The origin of the name "Gače" is uncertain. Petschauer suggests that the name is derived from Slovene "kača" 'snake'. However, Bezlaj derives this and similar names (e.g., "Gačnik") from Slovene "gat" 'weir, dike, barrier', generally referring to a barrier that water spills over. In the past the German name was "Gatschen".
History.
Gače was a Gottschee German village. The settlement was not mentioned in the land registries of 1574 or 1770, but it does appear in the Črmošnjice land registry of 1754. The settlement had only four residents in 1880, and the village was abandoned before the First World War. The ruins of the village mayor's house were partially restored in 1995. Gače has been used for skiing since before the Second World War, and the Bela ski center now operates at Gače.

<doc id="36603013" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36603013" title="Typhoon Saola (2012)">
Typhoon Saola (2012)

Typhoon Saola (international designation: 1209, JTWC designation: 10W, PAGASA name: Gener) was a tropical cyclone affecting the Philippines, Taiwan and China. It was the ninth named storm and the fourth typhoon of the 2012 Pacific typhoon season. "Saola" is the name of a rare mammal found in Vietnam.
Meteorological history.
On July 26, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) reported that a tropical depression had developed within an area of strong vertical windshear in the monsoon trough about to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines. During that day the shear relaxed before during the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system.
Early on July 28, the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical depression, whilst the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it "Saola". Soon, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded the system to a tropical depression and named it "Gener". Later that day, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a tropical storm. Early on July 29, the JMA upgraded Saola to a severe tropical storm. On July 30, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a category 1 typhoon, as it started to develop an eye-like feature, but soon downgraded it to a tropical storm late on the same day. On July 31, the JTWC upgraded Saola to a category 1 typhoon again. Late on the same day, the JMA upgraded Saola to a typhoon, and the JTWC soon upgraded it to a category 2 typhoon early on the next day. The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported that Typhoon Saola made landfall over Xiulin, Hualien in Taiwan at 19:20 UTC on August 1 (03:20 TST on August 2). However, Saola later moved counterclockwise and arrived the ocean soon, whilst the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm early on August 2 due to strong land interaction. At 06Z on the same day, Saola passed over Cape San Diego, the easternmost point of Taiwan. Late on August 2, the JMA downgraded Saola to a tropical storm, before it made landfall over Fuding in Fujian, China at 22:50 UTC (06:50 CST on August 3). On August 3, the JMA downgraded Saola to a tropical depression, after the JTWC issued a final warning on the system. The system continued to weaken into a weak low pressure area over Jiangxi, China on August 4. The weak, remnant low later drifted south west to the Gulf of Tokin, and regenerated slightly on August 7.
Preparations and impact.
Philippines.
Saola caused widespread rains in the Philippines due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon. On July 29, domestic and international flights throughout the country were delayed and cancelled. Small fishing crafts were advised to not engage in the water as a gale warning was issued by PAGASA. The NDRRMC alerted their agency as the storm is expected to bring heavy rains. Seaports were also advised to cancel their trips. Flooding is imminent as different dams are expected to reach its critical level and possibly release huge millimeters of water. About three roads in northern Luzon were impassable due to floods and landslides. About sixty families in Rodriguez, Rizal were evacuated due to severe flooding in the area. Early on July 30, classes were suspended from pre-school to tertiary level as strong winds and severe rainfall were recorded throughout Metro Manila and nearby provinces.
Initial reports spoke of around a dozen confirmed casualties, yet early on 3 August Philippine authorities revised the death toll in the country to 37, with at least 519,000 people affected. More than 17,500 were staying in evacuation centers. As of August 6, 51 fatalities were confirmed in the Philippines with six others reported missing. Damage from the storm amounted to about ₱404 million (US$9.6 million), half of which was due to agricultural losses.

As the storm made landfall in Taiwan, almost the entire island suspended services as high winds and rains triggered flooding in several locations. Almost 70 inches fell in some areas, ranking Saola within the top 5 wettest cyclones to ever hit the island. Authorities ordered schools and business to shut, with the exception of few major factories. Financial markets were also closed, and would remain until 3 August. Taiwanese Army soldiers rescued more than 1,000 people from remote mountainous villages in the north and east. Two passenger boarding bridges collapsed at Taoyuan International Airport, which serves Taipei, slightly damaging a China Airlines aircraft and forcing the company to scrap the flight. More than 200 international and domestic flight were reportedly cancelled because of the storm.
At least six people were killed and two were missing in Taiwan as of 2 August, in addition to 16 injured. Agricultural losses across the island were estimated at NT$812.51 million (US$27.14 million).

Col de la Schlucht

The Col de la Schlucht () is a mountain pass in the Vosges Mountains of France. The pass takes its name from the German word "Schlucht", meaning "gorge" or "ravine". It connects Munster (Haut-Rhin) with Gérardmer (Vosges) (east – west) and is also crossed by the Route des Crêtes (north – south). The climb over the pass has been used several times in the Tour de France cycle race.
History.
Between 1871 and 1918, the pass was a border crossing between Lorraine (France) and Alsace, which had been ceded to Germany under the Treaty of Frankfurt.
Prior to World war I, the pass could be accessed via two separate tramway lines, from Gérardmer (opened 1904) and Munster (opened 1907) respectively. Both lines were abandoned at the outbreak of the war; that from Munster was never re-opened, whereas the line from Gérardmer continued in service until 1940.
Facilities.
From the pass, it is possible to access the Sentier des Roches, a footpath along the edge of the ridge to Hohneck. This is considered to be one of the most impressive (and dangerous) Alsatian mountain paths.
There is also a ski-lift up Montabey; from the top of the ski-lift, there is a summer luge run back down to the pass.
Details of the climbs.
From the west, the climb starts at Le Kertoff, 4 km before Gérardmer. From here, the climb is 17 km long gaining 531 m in height at an average of 3.1%. The steepest section is at 6.7%. This was the climb used in the 2009 Tour de France.
The climb from the east starts at Munster from where there are 18 km to the summit, gaining 759 m in height. The overall average gradient is 4.2%, which is maintained fairly steadily throughout the climb. 
From La Bresse (south-west), the ascent via D34 is 16.2 km long climbing 494 m at an average of 3.0%. This climb passes the Col des Feignes () en route, after which there are two km at between 7 and 8%. 
From Fraize (north-west), the climb is 21 km at an average of 3.0%, gaining 652 m in height. 
The summit can also be accessed via Route des Crêtes from the Col du Bonhomme (north) or the Col du Grand Ballon (south).
Tour de France.
The climb over the pass was first used on stage 20 of the 1931 Tour de France, when the summit was crossed by a group of riders, although André Leducq was the first across the line after the descent into Colmar.
Appearances in the Tour de France (since 1947).
Since World War II, the col has been crossed seven times, either as a Category 2 or Category 3 climb.

If You Think You Know How to Love Me

"If You Think You Know How to Love Me" is a song by British rock band Smokie. It was first released in June 1975 as a single and appeared later on the album "Changing All the Time". Like the band's first single "Pass It Around", the song was composed by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman.
Upon its release, "If You Think You Know How to Love Me" became a chart success all over Europe, peaking at No. 3 in Sweden, No. 6 in Norway, No. 8 in Germany and No. 15 in the Netherlands. It took six weeks for the song to debut in the UK Singles Chart on 19 July 1975. After a few days Smokie appeared on TV show "Top of the Pops", and it helped "If You Think You Know How to Love Me" to climb the charts. The single eventually peaked at No. 3 and stayed there for nine weeks.
A second version of the song was included in the 1988 album "All Fired Up", sung by Alan Barton. The 1975 version was sung by original Smokie member Chris Norman.
Jim Capaldi recorded a cover of the song in 1976 which was released only on the A-side of a Germany-only single. He changed some of the lyrics to suit his assertive, independent personality: "You know you've got my life lying in your hands / It's up to you to make me understand" is replaced by "You've got my life figured in your plans / But there's one thing you got to understand", and the chorus line "You've got to lead the way" is replaced by "Don't try to lead the way". The track was also recorded by Pat Benatar on the 1979 album "In the Heat of the Night" but failed to chart.

The Incredibles (film score)

The Incredibles is the original score album, featured on the film of the same name composed by Michael Giacchino. "The Incredibles" is the first Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino. Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film's design — the future as seen from the 1960s. John Barry was the first choice to do the film's score, with a trailer of the film given a rerecording of Barry's theme to "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". However, Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks; the assignment was instead given to Michael Giacchino.
The completely orchestral score was released on November 2, 2004, three days before the film opened in theaters. It won numerous awards for Best Score and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Music used for the film's trailers but not available on the soundtrack album includes "On Her Majesty's Secret Service", from the Propellerheads album "Decksandrumsandrockandroll", as well as excerpts from the David Arnold project "". The animated short "Jack-Jack Attack", which accompanied the film's DVD release also features the "Alla Turca" movement from Mozart's "Piano Sonata No. 11".
Recording.
Giacchino noted that recording in the 1960s was largely different than modern day recording and Dan Wallin, the recording engineer, said that Bird wanted a very old feel, and as such the score was recorded on analogue tapes. Wallin noted that brass instruments, which are at the forefront of the score of "The Incredibles", sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, "the right way," which consists of everyone in the same room, "playing against each other and feeding off each other's energy" Tim Simonec was the conductor/orchestrator for the recording of the score.

Xokonoschtletl Gómora

Xokonoschtletl Gómora (; 17 February 1951, Mexico City) is a Mexican dancer who performs to Pre-Hispanic traditional music, a writer, lecturer and civic activist. He was commissioned by the United Nations for the Frente Mexicano Pro Derechos Humanos (English: Mexican Front for Human Rights) to promote the protection of Mexican cultural heritage. He is best known for leading the Asociación Civil Internacional Yankuik Anahuak (International Civil Association Yankuik Anahuak) and because for over thirty years he has pushed for the return of a quetzal feather headdress (Nahuatl: "q uetzalpanecáyotl") known as Montezuma's headdress currently located in the Vienna Museum of Ethnology (German: "Museum für Völkerkunde").
Activities.
Xokonoschtletl began working as a tourist guide and became involved with indigenous activists who promoted the protection of traditional Mexican culture. He later founded the Asociación Civil Yankuik Anahuak (International Civil Association Yankuik Anahuak), through which he has struggled for thirty years, without financial support from the government, for the return of a "quetzalpanecáyotl" (quetzal feather headdress) known as Montezuma's headdress housed at the Vienna Museum of Ethnology ("Museum für Völkerkunde"). Apart from quetzal feathers, the headdress is ornamented with gold and precious stones, and "is considered the most valuable Mexican relic that is abroad", Xokonoschtletl is also a member of the Frente Mexicano Pro Derechos Humanos (Mexican Front for Human Rights) and its representative to the United Nations, he considers very important that the plume back to Mexico because "is part of its identity and national culture". As part of this movement, every year since 1986, he organizes a march that goes from the UN offices in Vienna, to the Houses of Parliament, as well as artistic and cultural events.
Over the years his request has been supported by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH, National Institute of Anthropology and History), by Thomas Klestil, when he was president of Austria, and Heinz Fischer, current Austrian president and then president of the parliament. He was supported by Austrian legislators too, the members of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, led by Peter Schieder (chairman of the parliamentary committee of Foreign Policy), presented a proposal to return the headdress in 2005. In this initiative they said that it would be a token of gratitude for the Mexican people, because Mexico was the first country to show their support to Austria in 1938, protesting against its annexation to Nazi Germany. In 2009, legislators of the Communist Party of Austria presented a new initiative with a similar proposal. In Mexico, the movement has been supported by the deputy Jorge Triana, National Action Party member, and Rafael Elias Sanchez of the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
Xokonoschtletl is the official spokesman of the Consejo Mundial de Pueblos Indígenas (World Council of Indigenous People), and participates in civic activism, promoting the protection of cultural heritage and the support of ethnic minorities and disadvantaged people. His Pre-Hispanic traditional dance music group, called "Ometoetl" has presented several shows in Germany, as "La danza del venado" (Deer Dance). He is a lecturer and writer as well. Among his works written in Spanish are: "Lo que nos susurra el viento: la sabiduría de los aztecas" (1998), "Sentémonos al fuego: cuentos y relatos de la tradición azteca" (1998) and "Juicio a España Testigos Aztecas" (2007).

The church derives its name from a guado or fording ("vado" in dialect) that was located nearby. A church at the site was documented since the tenth century, but on Easter of 1171,
a miracle occurred when blood spouted from the eucharist during consecration. This made the church an object of pilgrimage. Reconstruction was started in 1495
under the patronage of Ercole de' Roberti under the designs of Biagio Rossetti. The church has a number of paintings by Carlo Bononi, Camillo Filippi, and Domenico Mona.

Thomas Rogers (clergyman)

Thomas Rogers (died 1616) was an English Anglican clergyman, known as a theologian, controversialist and translator.
Life.
He was a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1571, and graduated B.A. 7 July 1573, and M.A. 6 July 1576. He was subsequently (11 December 1581) rector of Horringer in Suffolk. Initially he was on good terms with local Puritan figures such as John Knewstub and Walter Allen; but his own views changed within a few years. Rogers was an early opponent of Nicholas Bownde in the Sabbatarian controversy.
Rogers became chaplain to Richard Bancroft, and assisted him in literary work. He died at Horringer, and was buried in the chancel of his church there, 22 February 1616.
Works.
Rogers's major works were on the English creed:
The latter subsequently appeared in another form as an exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles, entitled "The Faith, Doctrine, and Religion professed and protected in the Realm of England and Dominions of the same, expressed in Thirty-nine Articles". This book was later praised by Augustus Toplady, Edward Bickersteth and other evangelical divines, and was reprinted in 1854 by the Parker Society. 
Popular were Rogers's translation of "The Imitation of Christ" (London, 1580); often reprinted till 1639 and his "Of the Ende of this World and the Second Coming of Christ", translated from the Latin of Scheltoo à Geveren, London 1577, 1578, 1589. The latter work endorsed the conclusions of George Joye on the second coming as due in the sixteenth century, and with more specific predictions to the later 1580s. À Geveren was a lawyer in Emden, whom Rogers may have visited in 1577; his work was influenced by mystical and rabbinic thought.
Other original publications by him were:
Rogers's translations included:
William Carew Hazlitt also identified him with the Thomas Rogers, author of "Celestiall Elegies of the Goddesses and the Muses, deploring the death of Frances, Countesse of Hertford", London, 1598; reprinted in the Roxburghe Club's "Lamport Garland", 1887. The work is now attributed to Thomas Rogers of Bryanston.

Marion Kozak

Marion Kozak or Marion Kozak Miliband (born 1934 as Dobra Jenta Kozak, also known as Maria Kozak) is a Polish-born Holocaust survivor who emigrated to the United Kingdom in the 1950s. In 1961 she married Ralph Miliband (1924–1994) and their two sons, David Miliband and Ed Miliband, have risen to prominence in modern-day British politics.
Birth and early life.
Kozak was the daughter of wealthy Jewish parents, in the Polish town of Czestochowa, with a Jewish population of about 35,000. In 1939 when the Germans took control, the Kozaks’ factory was commandeered and transformed into a munitions plant. In the town, an estimated 2,000 Jews were murdered on the spot and another 40,000 transported to the gas chambers at the Treblinka extermination camp. At some point Polish nuns in a convent took the Kozaks in and hid them from the Germans. Marion refuses to divulge where or when this took place. She also credits the "kindness and generosity of acquaintances in Warsaw" with her survival. She was also known as Maria. In the only official version of events, a biography of her husband Ralph Miliband written by a family friend, Michael Newman states that: "For the rest of the war Marion, Hadassa and their mother had been in constant danger and owed their lives to several brave people, Jewish and non-Jewish, many of whom were themselves killed".
In 2009 David Miliband, serving in his capacity as the Foreign Secretary, expressed his thanks to the Polish people for having saved his mother during the Holocaust. During an official visit to Poland he said: "My mother was born here, her life was saved by those who risked theirs sheltering her from Nazi oppression" that was regarded as an "extraordinary revelation". The report states that "Miliband’s Polish Jewish mother, Marion Kozak, is from Czestochowa in southern Poland and emigrated in the 1950s" and that "his paternal grandparents were also Polish Jews".
Marriage to Ralph Miliband.
According to The Guardian, Marion Kozak had once been a student (at the London School of Economics) of the Marxist scholar and fellow Holocaust survivor Ralph Miliband. They married in 1961. Her background and politics were similar to his, and she had a comparable, though less high-profile, career as an activist and academic. Yet she was more outgoing and had broader interests. In 1965 their son David Miliband was born. Marion hosted relatives, left-wing writers, dissidents such as Joe Slovo of the South African Communist Party, academics from abroad, the occasional politician. Sons David and Ed Miliband (born 1969) were encouraged to join in.
Political views.
Kozak has been described in London's "The Jewish Chronicle" as a long-standing human rights campaigner and an early activist for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (in parallel with being described as keeping "a low profile" and being "a very private woman"). Kozak is also described as being "a long-standing supporter of left-wing pro-Palestinian organisations" and is a signatory of the founding statements of both Jews for Justice for Palestinians (founded 2002) and a supporter of Independent Jewish Voices (launched 2007).
Influence and stance towards her sons.
A BBC report described Kozak as a "campaigning mother" who, unlike her husband Ralph, remained loyal to the UK Labour Party. However, she is thought to have been a greater influence on the political development of her sons. "There's no doubt that Ed got a lot of his drive from Marion and a lot of his feel for nitty-gritty grassroots politics from Marion too," according to Dr. Marc Stears, politics fellow at the University of Oxford. Friends have stated that the contest between the brothers has been a huge "strain" for their mother and that she has even told people it would have been much easier had they simply become academics rather than politicians. She was reported as "maintain a low profile" in 2010 when Ed Miliband defeated David Miliband to become leader of the Opposition in the United Kingdom. 
As an example, the "Daily Mail" reported that during the Labour Party contest for party leader in 2010 between her sons, she would miss the climax of the contest because she could not bear to watch the result, and would not be present for an announcement.
Ed Miliband has admitted "my mum probably doesn’t agree with me...but like most mums is too kind to say so."

<doc id="36603414" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36603414" title="Technical Reglament Conformity Certificate">
Technical Reglament Conformity Certificate

The TR Certificate is a common name of the Technical Reglament (TR) Conformity Certificate. The notion of the Technical Reglament was introduced relating to the certification of the products and other objects of proving the conformity by the Federal Law “About Technical Regulation” in the RF. Unlike the Russian standards the GOSTs, performing of Technical Reglaments was defined by the law as the obligatory ones on the territory of the RF, while the GOSTs have only recommendatory character. 
The TR Certificate.
The program of the RF Government for development of the Technical Reglaments meant the gradual replacement of the acting standards by the requirements of the corresponding Technical reglaments. Before introducing of the TR for the certain kind of the production the obligation of proving the conformity regulating the quality and safety of the production to the standards was set by the Governmental Act №982 of January 1 2009. By introducing the next TR of the RF the proof of conformity of the products safety obeyed he given document if the goods were included into the list of products regulated by the given reglament. 
The types of the TR.
Nowadays there are about 20 Technical Reglaments on the territory of the RF.
The process of certification.
In accordance with them different products must be certified in the form of the certificate of conformity to technical reglament and the declaration of conformity. The procedure of proving the conformity is performed within one of the obligatory certification systems which are formed by a federal structure in a certain sphere of activity and have a state registration in Rosstandart, which has a responsibility to perform functions of a central body for proving the conformity in the RF.
The drawing up the TR Certificate is initialized by applying to the certification body that has the Attestation of Accreditation for proving the conformity to the requirements of a certain TR. The form of the TR Conformity Certificate is a little different form the GOST R Conformity Certificate. But also the TR certificates are drawn up on the typographic forms that have a number of security anti-fake levels. 
The RF TR Conformity Certificate appears to be the official document that permits circulation on the territory of the RF of the production that must have the obligatory proof of obeying the requirements of safety of the Technical Reglament. If the production is listed in the reglament, so it must not be realized and exploited in Russia without the TR Certificate. 
The RF TR Conformity Certificate gives the right to the manufacturers to mark their production by the circulation sign on the market. If the safety of the production is regulated by several Technical Reglaments, so the marking sign of TR Conformity may be used for the production only after drawing up all the obligatory TR Conformity Certificates.
The TR Conformity Certificates of the Customs Union.
Until February 2012 on the territory of the RF there was one more technical reglament in accordance to which it was obligatory to draw up the declaration of the TR certificate on the base of the Russian reglament of safety of pyrotechnic materials and the products containing them. But according to the program meaning for the development within the frameworks of the legislation of the Customs Union Technical Reglament, they introduced the First CU Technical Reglament. Along with this the power of the corresponding RF reglament stops and the RF TR Conformity Certificate are not issued any more. The production listed in the CU reglament must go through the procedure of evaluating the conformity with drawing up the CU TR declaration or the certificate.
The program for developing the CU Technical Reglaments means 47 main documents which must in 2013 exchange the majority of RF TR which are valid on the territory of the RF. Nowadays the Customs Union Commission has made the corresponding decisions to enter more than 20 CU Technical Reglaments. Their enforcement is defined by the decisions themselves.

Since 1 June 2012 the CU TR Conformity Certificate is valid for the production relating to the means of individual protection. Since 1 July 2012 it is necessary to draw up the CU TR certificates in accordance with the following CU reglaments:
The CU Technical Reglament Conformity certificates are drawn up in the certification bodies that are authorized within the national systems of conformity evaluation and included into the unified list of certification bodies of the Customs Union. The same requirement relates also to the certification laboratories because the most certificates of UC TR Conformity may be drawn up only on the base of independent tests of the samples of production in the specialized laboratory.
The CU TR Certificate acts not only on the territory of the RF but also on the territories of the countries that are the members of the Union (Belarus and Kazakhstan). The term of validity of a certain certificate is defined by the regulating document itself and in large extent depends on the kind of the production, certified volume, applicant who applies for the procedure of evaluation of conformity (no matter if he is a manufacturer, importer or the seller of the production), on the scheme of the certification, existence of different documents obligatory for proof of conformity and other factors.

Karsog

Karsog is a small town situated in the lap of Himalayas, near Shimla, at a height of 1,404 metres. It is in the Karsog Mandal subdivision of Mandi district in Himachal Pradesh in India. It lies in the Pir Panjal range of Himalayas bordering Shimla District. 
Tourism.
Karsog is famous for its temples, including the Mamleshwar Mahadev, Kamksha Devi and Mahunag temples. It is full of scenic beauty and abundance of apple orchards. The natural surroundings are regarded as beautiful, with green forests and a pollution-free environment.
Karsog (Ksg) is a Town in Karsog Mandal in Mandi District in Himachal Pradesh State in India .
Distance of Karsog from various places...
Mandi Karsog 125 km
Shimla Karsog 106 km
Karsog Pangna 25 km
Karsog Kelodhar 13 km
Karsog Churag 18 km'"
Accessible from the state capital Shimla, the tracks around Karsog and Chindi are among the most picturesque areas of Himachal Pradesh. 
There are wide valleys criss-crossed by streams and carpeted with fields of assorted vegetables and grain. From fertile floors, orchards and thick forests rise to touch snow covered peaks. 
The small villages and their age-old architecture give expression to the phrase ‘picture perfect’. Legends and folklore abound, and every one of the temples is a repository of local culture and an example of remarkable building skills.
Named after the local deity, Chandika (Chindi) Mata, the tiny village of Chindi rests along a highway that services Shimla, Karsog and Mandi. A little further ahead, at the village of Bakhrote, is the bifurcation to Kullu and Manali along a less travelled but thoroughly delightful route. In some ways, the area harks back to old ‘hill stations’ before they became over-built messes – a few scattered houses, the little bazaar or two, patches of forests and wide open views. 
From the hotel at Chindi, the rise of Kunhoo Dhar is accessed through the Karsog bazaar. This large flat hilltop presents a 360 degrees view of the area. The Karsog valley lies below, to the north is the peak of Shikari Devi. Some of the other well known ranges and mountains visible from Kunhoo Dhar are the Pir Panjal, the Hanuman Tibba, the rises around the Jalori Pass, the bare Chawasi Tibba, Narkanda’s Hattu Peak and the Shali Tibba. The villages of Churag, Chindi and Mahunag form a part of the foreground and the other sightseeing places of Dhamoon and Sairi Bangla ( Bungalow ) are also visible. Kunhoo Dhar has a large pond while a low rise holds the small temple dedicated to both Kamakshya ( Kamakhya ) Devi and Nag Dhamooni. Local tradition has it that this was the site of the original palace of the former princely state of Suket – in whose territories these tracts once were. 
The village of Karsog is surrounded by wide steps of fields and holds the main bazaar of the valley. Agriculture is the mainstay of the area and it is well known for its wheat, corn, rice and a variety of lentils and beans. The valley is criss-crossed by several brooks and the ‘twin’ Amla ( Imla ) and Bimla streams. From the Karsog bazaar, the village of Mamel is a bare couple of kilometres and has the temple of Mamleshwara Mahadev. Local belief has it that the temple dates to the times of the epic Mahabharata when it founded by the Pandava brothers. And drawing on India’s other great epic, the Ramayana, it is regarded that after King Ravana of Lanka was killed by Bhagwan Rama, his soul could not be free till an image of Bhagwan Shiva was installed here—which was done by Rama with the use of supernatural powers. The sages Parshurama and Brighu are also believed to have meditated at the spot. 
Using sleepers of considerable girth, the temple is an attractive wood and slate structure and it is believed that the sacred fire in the temple has been kept burning from times immemorial - and that the level of the ashes never increases. There is an unusually large drum in the temple with rhinoceros hide. Also shown on request, is a large grain of wheat supposedly dating to the mythological times of the Satyuga. Some recently excavated shivalingas have been installed by the side of the temple.
A little further down lies the village of Kau and the temple of Kamakshya Mata. The goddess in this temple is seen as manifest at the spot, due to the meditations and sacrifices of Lord Parshurama. Today, the remarkable expression and the intensity of the eyes of the principal image cast in ‘ashtadhatu’, the eight primary metals, is striking. The deity is depicted as the "Mahishasuramardini"—the slayer of the demon "Mahisha", who stalked the world in the shape of a buffalo. Rebuilt in the original genre, the temple is an example of local woodworking skills. Small chambers hold other images and the ‘bedchamber’ of the goddess. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple is said to be an underground chamber that is not accessible to worshippers. The original stone image of the deity is in this room. A large drum, similar to the one at Mamel is one of the noteworthy objects in the temple.
A local story has it that the ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Suket, in whose territories the area fell, was pressuring local people to join the British forces during the Second World War. The people were reluctant to do so, and felt it was the intervention of the goddess that ended the war and saved her people from being slain. An annual fair celebrates the event. Dushera is another major celebration in the temple and several buffaloes are sacrificed.
The hill of Shikari Devi ( 3359m ) stands as a divider between the Karsog and Janjheli valleys. From both, a steep hike leads to the top. The route is through thick woods that have trees of deodar ( Himalayan cedar), spruce, fir and walnut – and several rare herbs. From Chindi, the trail rises just after the village of Bakrote and guides and ponies can be hired for the trail. From Bakhrote, you can drive along the initial couple of kilometres. The top provides a view of the entire area. 
The area is a wildlife sanctuary that hosts the musk deer, ghoral, bears and a variety of pheasants and other birds. Small huts of the migrant Gaddi and Gujjar people lie along the trail and in spring and again in late autumn you can see them moving with their flocks of cattle. 
As in practically every other part of Himachal, temples abound in the Chindi-Karsog area. There are several dedicated to the deity Nag Dhamooni who is especially worshipped by childless couples – some of the more attractive structures are at Sairi Bangla ( Bungalow ) and at Saranda. Again near Chindi and accessed by an attractive drive through pine woods that gradually give way to deodars, the temple of Mahunag is regarded as one of the most important in the area. This is considered the core temple of the deity Mahunag, who embodies Karna of the epic Mahabharata. 
A little off the drive to Mandi lies the village of Pangana, which was the original seat of the rulers of Suket, until they shifted the capital to Sundernagar. The centuries-old Devi Kot temple is one of the most remarkable examples of traditional architectural skills. Its wood mesh, packed with dressed stone, rises six stories to approximately fifty feet. The deity Mahamaya and the deified princess of Suket, Chandravati are enshrined in the compound. Past Pangana, and through thick forests and little villages the road winds down to Chail Chowk and the road to Manali. En route and accessible from the vaillage Chowki, after an uphill hike of half a dozen kilometres through thick woods, lies the temple of Kamrunag. For centuries, this temple has been held in high veneration. Interestingly, through all this time the offerings of gold, silver, ornaments and coins have been dropped in the small lake that lies in front of the temple.

For more than 100 years, The Atlanta Woman’s Club has been involved in community and national needs including promoting the quality of life in the City of Atlanta, education, preserving natural resources, stressing good citizenship, encouraging healthy lifestyles, contributing to world peace and international understanding, and supporting participation in the arts. The Atlanta Woman’s Club engages in a diverse range of projects, from their work to establish the Atlanta public kindergarten system, mobile libraries, the Sweet Auburn Farmers Market, and the establishment of Hartsfield International Airport. AWC also actively supports the Tallulah Falls School, which has been owned and operated by the Georgia Federation since 1909.
Club History.
As quoted by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Roslyn Carter in their foreword in “A Light on Peachtree: A History of the Atlanta Woman’s Club - "“Many in Atlanta may not realize that our city and the state of Georgia could have faced a very different history had it not been for the successful advocacy and funding of several important projects undertaken by the Atlanta Woman’s Club,most notably with the inception and development of the Atlanta airport… ”"
In the late 1800s women’s clubs were forming across the country. At the time, women were second-class citizens, not allowed to vote, take part in politics, or speak in public groups. In defiance, Jane Croly formed the first woman’s club in New York City whose goal was to empower women through unity, to encourage women to discuss social and intellectual topics, and to nurture personal development and community involvement. By 1892, there were clubs around the country and they joined and formed the General Federation of Woman’s Clubs under the motto “Unity in Diversity.” The clubwomen of Atlanta defined their mission as social, literary and humanitarian. In the beginning, the Atlanta Woman’s Club faced an unfavorable public sentiment, and many husbands forbade their wives to join. But as the club gained status, male fears diminished and members became important in civic and local social affairs.
The Atlanta Woman’s Club was formed in 1895 following a meeting of the Cotton States Exposition in Piedmont Park. The council of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs] was in held Atlanta and Mrs. Rebecca Douglas Lowe was present at this meeting. Following the meeting at Piedmont Park in the fall of 1895, Mrs. Lowe gathered together a group of interested ladies in her home. After this gathering, the Atlanta Woman’s Club was formed and Mrs. Lowe was elected its leader. In 1896, Mrs. Lowe invited 17 other women’s clubs to meet and form the Georgia Federation of Women’s Clubs. She became the President of the GFWC Georgia in 1897. She ultimately went on to provide strong leadership to the General Federation of Women’s Clubs (GFWC)from 1898-1902.
The Atlanta Woman's Club's first home was in Mrs. Lowe’s home. The Club then moved to the DeGive Opera House in downtown Atlanta, which was also known as the Loew's Grand Theatre. In 1910, the Atlanta Woman's Club purchased its first home, which was the Christian Science building located on West Baker Street at the intersection of Peachtree Street and West Peachtree. The Atlanta Woman’s Club remained in that home until 1920 at which time they moved to The Wimbish House in Atlanta, Georgia.
History by the Decades.
The early 1900s was known as the Gilded Age and widespread economic growth pushed the U.S. ahead of Britain, especially through heavy industry like factories, railroads, and coal mining. These businesses were powered by a cheap underclass of laborers, many of whom were small children. When the first Club President Rebecca Lowe encouraged the Club to look into areas of needed reform, GFWC clubwomen of this era responded by working for a public kindergarten, better working conditions, the enactment of child labor laws, and the creation of night schools for child factory workers. The General Federation of Woman’s Club expressed at the time “So long as children six years of age are employed in mills and factories can any woman’s club say it has no responsibility?” At the same time clubwomen continued to broaden their own educational opportunities and those of community by hosting a variety of educational lectures and programs on topics from sociology, to taxation to the arts. The Atlanta Woman's Club became part of the greater efforts of the Georgia Federation of Women's Clubs to support education in Georgia’s mountainous regions and supported the establishment of the Tallulah Falls School in 1909. According to one early Club member, “The decline in gossip is really startling. Not so much that we are better than we used to be, but just haven’t the time.”
In the second decade of the 1900s the Club became increasingly concerned about drug abuse and juvenile justice. The club campaigned against drugs, worked with prisoners in the city stockade and women's jail, and campaigned against the exploitation of minors. The GFWC clubwomen were so effective that the New York Times commended them for their ability to work quietly behind the scenes in getting their men folk to bring about social reform such as ending the evil system of leasing convicts. The Club created a good roads committee, worked towards the establishment of a Municipal employment Bureau, and formed a committee to censor motion pictures for children. They promoted peace efforts in Europe, but once World War I broke out, they worked tirelessly to improve conditions for American soldiers abroad by preparing medical kits and encouraging the sale of war bonds. However, in the early 1900s women were still barred from all state supported institutions of higher learning, had yet to receive the vote, and were obviously not making decisions about war and peace. After two decades of work on behalf of child laborers there was finally legislation requiring children between the ages 8 and 14 to attend school at least 3 months a year. Although the Club focused heavily on equal education for women, it generally avoided overt support of the suffragettes of this era. Georgia’s agricultural economy was changing at this time from a cotton based economy to fruits and vegetables. The clubwomen supported this by creating the idea of local curb markets to sell Georgia produce and the Sweet Auburn Curb market, known today as the Municipal Market was formed and still thrives today.
In the 1920s the Atlanta Woman’s Club’s membership rose to over 1,000 members. During this time the GFWC clubwomen opposed an effort to exclude Catholic teachers from public schools, they put together the Atlanta Woman's Club Cookbook 1921 that was distributed all over the world, they started a university for homemakers teaching home economics and providing a playroom downtown to take care of children, and in a meeting initiated by the Atlanta Woman’s Club president in 1925 with the Mayor of Atlanta, the club president urged the City to purchase a landing field south of Atlanta. That landing field is now the busiest airport in the world and has led the city to become the vibrant business center that it is.
In the 1930s the speculation of the 1920s caught up with reality resulting in the Great Depression. Of course this created additional opportunities for philanthropy and social service, but the cost of club work and the members’ financial conditions were also of concern. The Atlanta Woman's Club members were thrifty and managed to continue to work on a wide variety of projects. They worked to widen the outlet for Georgia Farm goods by staging an exposition of Georgia grown products at the Atlanta city auditorium and sponsored plant sales at the farmers market to help women from rural areas with an additional source of income. AWC club women also continued to sponsor programs to educate themselves and the community about family finance as women became more responsible for supplementing for providing family income. The Atlanta Woman’s Club celebrated the success of their efforts to get women admitted to University of Georgia and included as doctors at the State Hospital for the mentally ill. In 1935 when President Roosevelt visited Georgia, the Atlanta Woman's Club president served on the welcoming committee. The Club was also behind a committee to plant an eventual 1,000 dogwood trees in the city of Atlanta. The Club became the venue for the Atlanta Writers Club, and presented a variety of charity performances in the auditorium to benefit the needy.
The decade of the 1940s marked the 50th anniversary of women's clubs. Women across the country celebrated. As another war in broke out in Europe, clubwomen emphasized peace and helped members to learn more about international affairs. The Atlanta Woman’s Club participated in GFWC’s campaigns to finance America's military needs. A “buy a bomber” campaign across the women’s clubs of the country brought in an astounding $101 million. $154 million was raised to finance an air Armada for the Navy. The Atlanta Woman's Club members donated 568,000 hours of service to the defense effort. When the war ended, the Club participated in efforts to support veterans, as well as other initiatives to continue to support preschool training for children, support for Georgia products, conservation, and preservation of the States Forests, and the arts.
With the Kennedys in the White House and war temporarily over, the Arts seemed to capture the interest of The Atlanta Woman’s club members in the 1950s. The Club members presented both a play and vocal performance highlighting the history of the Club. They offered programs related to music, opera, writing, antiques, and art. But still had serious concerns. Club members became interested in helping the mentally, physically and developmentally disabled. They promoted the early use of seat belts, and continued their focus on juveniles by advocating their release out of Georgia prisons. They supported the passage of the Fugitive Fathers bill, and pushed for the development of programs for rehabilitating prisoners. As always they continued to focus on to Talullah Falls School and supported a plan to modernize the school by adding a President's House, an athletic field, and modern classroom buildings.
The 60's was an era of uneasiness with concerns about assassination, civil unrest and the war in Vietnam. GFWC clubwomen’s work reflected this with support and concern for veterans, help for the needy, and emphasis on international relations. The plight of the Native Americans and preservation of Native American culture was also a national issue at that time and the GFWC held a meeting with a prominent Indian Affairs Officer to learn more.
Although the Atlanta Woman’s Club members were progressive in many ways, and in spite of GFWC’s diversity motto, in the era of Jim Crow, the Club was segregated. A similar club for African American women Atlanta Federation of Negro Women’s Clubs existed at this time. Today, the Club enjoys a very diverse membership.
The 1970s were challenging for the women's clubs. More vocal champions of women's liberation were effecting change throughout the country through protests and marches, whereas GFWC club members were used to working through legislative and other more traditional avenues. But the times were changing and the Georgia Federation of Women's Club president showed up at her installation banquet wearing of all things... a pantsuit! Many women continued to believe that the Atlanta Woman’s Club’s headquarters, Wimbish House, located in downtown Atlanta was dangerous and the membership grew smaller and older. Nonetheless, the Club continued to pursue its mission, including supporting Bicentennial events, raising money for a chapel at Tallulah Falls School, and working to save the historic Fox Theater from destruction.
In the 1980s among the GFWC club projects in this era were getting safety crossing arms installed on school buses, getting the legislature to pass the first child restraint law, getting stricter DUI laws, and stopping a bill that would allow motorcyclists to forgo helmets.
The 1990s were a despairing decade for the Atlanta Woman's Club. The club headquarters, The Wimbish House was broken into and irreplaceable antiques were stolen. Shortly after, a fire destroyed part of the house. Although the Atlanta Woman's Club members were emotionally drained by these events, but with Scarlett O'Hara determination, the sturdy members decided that if they could save the Fox Theatre they'd better save the Grand Old Lady of Peachtree. The House was rebuilt under the watchful eyes of architect Zachary Henderson who specialized in restoration of older homes.
Today, The Atlanta Woman’s Club forges forward with its dedication to making a difference in the lives of people in its local and global communities. To quote former President Cynthia Sapero, “the Atlanta Woman’s Club’s members have brought happiness, beauty, and fulfillment to many people, and it is with an ‘invincible spirit’ we continue on.”

Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria

The Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria is the body which supervises Israeli universities and colleges in the West Bank. Its authority in the West Bank is similar to that of the Council for Higher Education in Israel in Israel proper.
As Israeli law does not apply in the occupied West Bank, the Council for Higher Education in Israel has no legal standing there, so by a military decree a similar institution was formed in the West Bank to regulate the Israeli institutions of higher learning there.
The Council for Higher Education in Judea and Samaria only applies to Israeli institutions, and not to Palestinian institutions which also exist in the West Bank.

Gaius Annius Anullinus

Gaius Annius Anullinus (died 4th century) was a Roman senator who was appointed consul in AD 295.
Biography.
Descended of a family which originated in Africa and a pagan, Anullinus’ early career is unknown. A leading figure of Rome’s urban aristocracy, he was possibly the son of the senator Anullinus, who allegedly freed the future emperor Diocletian’s father from slavery. He first appears as the "consul posterior" alongside Nummius Tuscus in AD 295. From 1 July 302 to 1 July 305, Anullinus was the Proconsular governor of Africa Proconsularis.
During his time there he implemented the edicts against the Christians as decreed by the emperor Diocletian. He travelled across the province, stopping at towns and holding judicial hearings, and enforcing the letter of the law. He ordered the execution of Felix, Bishop of Tibiuca, who refused to hand over copies of the Christian scriptures over to the authorities. He oversaw the execution of the Martyrs of Abitina and he also ordered the execution of Crispina after presiding over a trial where she refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Ultimately however, he attempted to maintain some balance between convincing the imperial courts of his adherence in enforcing their decrees, and convincing the local population that he was doing his job only to the limited extent that was necessary, and not so zealously that it would impact his ability to govern the province peacefully. Regardless, after the persecutions were over, the monuments and buildings erected by him during his time as governor were purposely defaced by the local Christians.
In AD 306, Anullinus was appointed "Praefectus Urbi" (Urban Prefect) of Rome a post he held from 19 March 306 through to 27 August 307. Although he was appointed by the emperor Severus, he eventually abandoned Severus and conspired with the Praetorian Prefect and the "tribunus fori suarii" of the Cohortes urbanae, Lucianus, to install the Roman usurper Maxentius.
Maxentius later appointed Anullinus Urban Prefect for a second time, apparently as an attempt to garner good fortune prior to his upcoming clash against his rival, Constantine I. Anullinus held the post from 27 October through to 29 November 312. He was appointed the day before Maxentius was defeated by Constantine I at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, and greeted Constantine when he entered Rome on his second day as Prefect. Constantine kept him on in the office throughout November.
Sometime during the reign of Maxentius, Anullinus and 12 other senators each contributed 400,000 sesterces, probably for the construction of a building in Rome.

Peñasquito Polymetallic Mine

The Peñasquito Polymetallic Mine is the fifth largest silver mine in the world and the second largest in Mexico. It is located in north-eastern corner of the State of Zacatecas and is wholly owned by the Canadian company Goldcorp through a Mexican subsidiary. It is an open pit operation which began operations in March 2010, but still managed to produce 13,952,600 ounces of silver that year. Estimated reserves for the Peñasquito Mine are 17.82 million oz of gold, 1,070.1 million oz of silver, 3,214 tons of lead and 7,098 million tons of zinc.
Geology.
The country rock consists of Mesozoic sediments that were deposited in the Mexico Basin (Mexico Geosyncline). These sediments were intruded by quartz-feldspar porphyries, quartz monzonite porphyries, and other feldspar-phyric intrusives in the late Eocene to the mid-Oligocene, which form sills, dikes, and stocks. The primary ore for the Peñasquito Polymetallic Mine is in two diatreme breccias, named the Peñasco and the Brecha Azul. The mineralization contains gold, silver, lead and zinc. The diatremes flare upward, and are filled with brecciated country rock and intrusions. The rock surrounding the diatremes contain disseminated galena, sphalerite and sulfosalts within phyllic (sericite–pyrite–quartz) and proplytic (chlorite–epidote–pyrite) hydrothermal alteration envelopes. Where the diatremes intersect limestone units manto deposits of ore mineralization occur.

Mašelj

Mašelj (; in older sources also "Mašlje", or "Maschen") is a small settlement in the Municipality of Semič in Slovenia. The area is part of the historical region of Lower Carniola. The municipality is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Mašelj is known locally as "Graben". The settlement has no permanent residents today.
History.
Mašelj was a Gottschee German village. It was not yet mentioned in the Kočevje land registry of 1574 and was probably founded in the 17th century. Before the Second World War it had eight houses, two sawmills, two mills, and an electrical plant that provided power to Mašelj and Črmošnjice. The residents were expelled in December 1941, and five houses were burned in the summer of 1942. After the armistice with Italy the Partisans established a mechanical workshop in one of the houses, and a kitchen and bath in another house. One mill in Mašelj is said to have operated until the end of the war and one sawmill into the 1950s, but today there are only scant remains of these. The site of the village is registered as cultural heritage.

Tom Waterhouse

Thomas Robert "Tom" Waterhouse (born 11 June 1982) is an Australian bookmaker and businessman. Waterhouse is a fourth generation bookmaker, and the great grandson of one of the first official bookmakers in Australia.
His grandfathers on both sides were involved in the racing industry. William "Bill" Waterhouse was a successful bookmaker in the 1960s and 1970s. The late trainer Tommy J. Smith, trained 279 Group One winners, including two Melbourne Cup winners.
Early Life.
Waterhouse was born in Sydney, New South Wales and educated at Sydney Church of England Grammar School (Shore) in North Sydney, where he became senior prefect and house captain. He studied a bachelor of Commerce & Liberal Studies at Sydney University, majoring in finance and marketing with the intention of working in finance.
Bookmaking.
In 2001, Waterhouse’s father, Robbie Waterhouse, asked him if he would help out at Rosehill racecourse, which Waterhouse enjoyed. He was only six months into his Commerce degree, but he immediately rearranged his timetable so that he could attend the races for the rest of the week.
After obtaining his bookmaking licence he began working as a bookmaker on course in 2003. By 2008, Waterhouse was Australia's biggest on-track bookmaker, holding more than $20 million over four days at the Melbourne Cup carnival, more than all the other bookmakers combined.
For four years Waterhouse lived in Melbourne’s Crown Casino for most of the week due to the protectionist betting laws in NSW.
Internet based business.
Waterhouse's online gambling business is tomwaterhouse.com. The business is owned by a network of companies owned by Robbie, Louise (Robbie's sister) and Tom Waterhouse. The company is one of Australia’s largest corporate bookmakers, with offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Darwin, and claims a client list of 100 "high net worth individuals" whose minimum bet is $1000. 
In 2013, the escalating presence of tomwaterhouse.com promotions and editorial commentary on free-to-air television led to a significant backlash from the Australian public against Waterhouse personally and the wider gambling industry. In 2013, Tom Waterhouse declined an invitation to appear before a federal parliamentary committee into gambling reform. Tom Waterhouse released a statement to the committee denying that his advertising during sports broadcasts intentionally targeted children. 
Australian Senator Nick Xenophon said, "Tom Waterhouse has pushed the envelope to the extent that it has now got to the point that it's out of control and there needs to be a legislative response" 
In May 2013, Waterhouse was directed by NSW Racing stewards to keep his bookmaking business clearly separate from the training business of his mother Gai Waterhouse, to avoid public perceptions of a conflict of interest.
On 31 May 2013, Waterhouse issued a statement saying "I am sorry. I have listened to the PM and Australia and have made the call with Channel 9 to dramatically cut back on my advertising from tonight."
Family.
The first bookmaker in the family was Charles Waterhouse, who attained his licence in 1898. Waterhouse’s maternal Grandfather, T.J Smith was an Australian racehorse trainer. His mother, Gai Waterhouse (maiden name Gabriel Marie Smith) is a leading Australian horse trainer, businesswoman and a former actress. Gai Waterhouse served an apprenticeship under her father for fifteen years before receiving her own trainer's licence.
Waterhouse's father, Robbie Waterhouse and grandfather William "Bill" Waterhouse are also bookmakers. They have attracted controversy in the past including the loss of their bookmaker's licences for eighteen years (originally life bans) due to their involvement in the Fine Cotton substitution scandal in 1984.

Luxembourgish Braille

Luxembourgish Braille is the braille alphabet of the Luxembourgish language. It is very close to French Braille, but uses eight-dot cells, with the extra pair of dots at the bottom of each cell to indicate capitalization and accent marks. It is the only eight-dot alphabet listed in Unesco (2013). Children start off with the older six-dot script (Unesco 1990), then switch to eight-dot cells when they start primary school and learn the numbers.
Alphabet.
The Luxembourgish Braille alphabet started off as a reduced set of the letters of the French Braille alphabet, the basic 26 plus three letters for print vowels with diacritics: "é," "ë," "ä." With the shift to eight-point script, these three acquired an extra dot at point 8. The letters are thus:
Dot-7 is added to form capitals:
Apart from the accented letters, these are the letter forms of the Gardner–Salinas Braille code used for technical notation. The digits 1–9 (but not 0) are also as in Gardner–Salinas. However, Luxembourgish punctuation is quite different.
Numbers.
The Antoine notation being promoted in France is used for numbers. However, because there is no possibility of confusing these digits with the letters of the Luxembourgish alphabet, as there is with the French Braille alphabet, they are written without the French number sign . That is, in Luxembourgish Braille, numbers are simply written as they are in print, without requiring any special indication that they are numbers.
Punctuation.
The exclamation mark is unusual, and brackets are in effect capitalized braces.
Formatting.
Formatting is used for emphasis and the like. There are no capitalization or number signs in 8-dot Luxembourgish Braille.

Normal, Kentucky

Normal is a residential unincorporated community, located within the city of Ashland, Kentucky along U.S. Route 23 and U.S. Route 60 and the Ohio River. It was annexed by the City of Ashland in 1905. Previously, Normal was an independent community, and received it's mail from nearby Catlettsburg. Normal Presbyterian Church, founded in 1890, is one of the last surviving remnants of the original community of Normal. The originally wooden church was razed in 1957 when the current brick structure was completed across 44th Street. Normal was named after the Eastern Kentucky Normal School, a teachers school that was opened here in 1867, by Mrs Mordecai Williams, wife of the original landowner of the community. Mordecai Williams was an Iron master who owned 600 acres of land of the present day area of Normal, from Cliffside Branch to Haney Branch at the Catlettsburg city limits. His stately residence is still standing at Normal, a brick mansion of Colonial style, located on U.S. Routes 23 and 60 at the Catlettsburg-Ashland City Limits. Williams wife operated the Normal School from the home from 1878-1889. It is one of the oldest homes in the entire area and has long served as landmark to the community. Most residential zones in this section of the city have been transferred to commercial and industrial zones. Cintas Corporation operates a large facility in the former Washington Avenue section located east of the CSX railroad tracks. The community originally grew up around the coke plant built and operated by Semet Solvay and later owned by Armco/AK steel. The Normal coke plant was in operation from 1891 until it was finally closed due to its inability to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations in July 2011. The only concentrations of residential dwellings remaining in Normal are along Blackburn Avenue (also known as 45th Street), Daniels Street, and from Chestnut Avenue south to the Catlettsburg city limits, which is also known as Williams Addition.

Pyrmont Power Station

Pyrmont Power Station was an electricity generating plant located in the Sydney suburb of Pyrmont, New South Wales.
Sydney Electric Lighting Station.
The power station was built by the Electric Lighting Department of the Municipal Council of Sydney, and began operations in 1904 as the Sydney Electric Lighting Station. The original equipment included three Ferranti cross compound reciprocating steam engines, one of 500 horsepower (hp) and two of 1,000 hp, each of which drove a three phase alternator from Dick, Kerr & Co. for a total output of approximately 1,500 kilovolt-amperes (kVA). 
In 1905, two additional triple expansion 1,000 hp units were commissioned, increasing total capacity to approximately 2,700 kVA. Steam was supplied by 5 Babcock and Wilcox chain grate boilers each 10000 lb/hr at 160 PSI The five reciprocating engines were relegated to emergency use from 1911 and retired in 1916.
Turbo-Alternators.
Low Pressure Plant:-
Two Willans & Robinson - Dick, Kerr turbo-alternators were commissioned in 1907,(Nos 6+7) each with a capacity of 2MW.Steam was supplied by 4 Stirling boilers which exhausted to the original chimney. This plant remained in service until 1918 when it was demolished to make room for the high pressure plant. 2 Willans & Robinson 4MW reaction turbines were added in 1910(Nos8+9). 1 Willans & Robinson 4MW reaction added in 1912(No10). 1 AEG 5MW impulse turbine added in 1914(No11). Steam was supplied by 6 Babcock and Wilcox coal fired watertube boilers; each produced 24,000 lb per hour and 6 boilers each producing 27,000 lb/Hr at 160 PSI in Boiler House No2. Total capacity was 14.7 MW including the reciprocating engines. In 1915 2 B+W cross drum boilers each 40,000 lb/hr and a 5MW AEG generator(No11) were added.
High Pressure Plant:-
One Metro-Vickers 8MW generator was added in 1921,(No15). Two Metro-Vickers 12MW generators were added in 1922,(Nos 13+14). One Fraser+Chalmers 12MW generator(No17) and 1 Thompson 17.5MW machine,(No16) were added in 1924. Steam was supplied by 8 Babcock + Wilcox cross drum boilers each producing 65,000 lb/hr at 250PSI and 630degF in Boiler House No3, to the north of the original building. The turbo-alternators were installed in place of the reciprocating plant. 'A' Station capacity increased to 73 MW by 1924 (excluding the decommissioned reciprocating engine-driven plant).
The 1904-1924 installation became known as Pyrmont 'A' Station as the site was expanded.
Direct Current Supply.
Dynamotors were provided in at Town Hall and Lang Park to supply direct current to customers. Alternating current was adopted as the new standard from 1930, although the first AC substation did not come into use until 1935. The AC system was not completed until circa 1958. No new DC customers were accepted after 1935, but the existing supply continued, albeit with mercury-arc rectifiers in later years, until 1985.
Sydney County Council.
In 1936, all functions of the Electricity Department of the Municipal Council of Sydney were transferred to a new body, known as the Sydney County Council (SCC), which was formed in 1935. The Sydney County Council would be responsible for the supply of electricity to numerous constituent municipalities in the greater Sydney region. The constituent municipal councils elected and controlled the new body. This arrangement continued until 1952, when the SCC's generation responsibilities were transferred to the Electricity Commission of New South Wales.
Pyrmont 'B' Station.
By the late 1930s, the first turbo-alternators were nearing the end of their useful lives, and it was decided to redevelop the power station in 1938. In 1942, the SCC accepted the tender of Australian General Electric to supply a single 50 megawatt (MW), 50 Hz turbo-alternator manufactured by Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company Limited of Trafford Park, Manchester, England; the order was confirmed in 1944. This order was doubled in 1945, then doubled again in 1947, to a total of four 50 MW Range-units. These units generated current at 33 kV, which was also the transmission voltage, as there was no room for step-up transformers. Steam was supplied by 4 Lopulco Pulverised fuel boilers each producing 430,000 lbs/hr at 1250PSI and 950degF. Delayed by a post-Second World War backlog, the first 50 MW turbo-alternator arrived from England in 1948, but the new building designed to house it, construction of which commenced in 1947, was not ready. The first of the 50 MW units was not commissioned until 1952, five years behind schedule, and the fourth unit was in service by 1955.
When completed in 1955, Pyrmont 'B' was rated at 200 megawatts, making it the largest of the five power stations which existed in the inner Sydney area. Bunnerong Power Station, also formerly operated by the SCC, was much larger, but outside the inner city area. Pyrmont became an emergency generator from the 1970s onwards, as newer power stations were brought into use.
'B' Station was decommissioned in 1983 (along with White Bay Power Station) after little more than twenty years in regular use, and less than thirty years after its completion.
Electricity Commission of New South Wales.
From 1936 to 1952, Pyrmont was run by the Sydney County Council (SCC), which had assumed control of the Municipal Council of Sydney's generating assets. The Electricity Commission of New South Wales, formed in 1950, took control of Pyrmont on 1 January 1952, becoming its third and final operator.
Demolition.
After remaining derelict for almost a decade, the power station site was redeveloped as the Star City Casino (now "The Star"), which was opened in 1995 with a gala opening featuring an outdoor performance by Diana Ross. Part of the 'A' Station facade remains at the Star City Casino site, but the much larger 'B' Station structure was demolished in 1993.

North Sea Boats

North Sea Boats is an international boat building company specialized in building craft for military, law enforcement, SAR, commercial, and high performance applications. The company has presence in Sweden, Singapore and Indonesia, with headquarter located at Banyuwangi East Java Indonesia. North Sea Boats was founded in 2003 by John and Lizza Lundin as a trading name for PT. Lundin Industry Invest.
History.
John "Maine" Lundin grew up with boats, since his father Allan Lundin founded the Swedeship company which operated among others Gotland shipyard and Djupvik Shipyard in Sweden. After the Swedish shipyard crisis the Swedeship company was the largest privately owned boat building company in Sweden. and it was through Swedship that John first came to Indonesia in the mid 90's to investigate the company's expansion opportunities. Tragically, John's father passed away from cancer in 1996 and Swedeship was sold after some years, but the family dream of a shipyard in Indonesia still remained. After some years of small-scale furniture manufacturing, to gain experience of the Indonesian culture, John together with his wife Lizza felt ready to fulfill the family dream by founding the boat building company North Sea Boats in 2003.
Products.
The boats are mainly constructed by carbon composite techniques, such as dual surface vacuum core resin infusion, and can be configured to perform multi-role tasks in a broad range of operational environments. They can be powered by inboard diesel engines, outboard motors or by transom drives and waterjets.

Ultimo Power Station

The Ultimo Power Station, or Ultimo Powerhouse, was an electricity generating plant located in the inner-city Sydney suburb of Ultimo, New South Wales.
Commissioned in 1899, it was the first major power station in Sydney and was originally built to supply power for the electric tram network. Prior to this, a small installation had existed at Regent Street, which was brought into use on 15 June 1882. Additionally, experimental electric tram operations powered by small generators had been in intermittent use in Sydney since 1890.
Generating plant.
Ultimo Power Station boasted a mixture of equipment, initially consisting of American-made steam engines coupled to dynamoelectric machines (direct current generators). Later generating units were British-made turbo-alternators. Most of the alternating current (AC) equipment operated at 6,600 volts, 25 cycles per second.
Direct Current Plant - 600 V.
The original generating plant at Ultimo consisted of four cross compound, reciprocating steam engines supplied by E.P. Allis & Co of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, each rated at 1250 horsepower (hp) and running at 100 rpm. HP Cylinder Diameter was and LP cylinder diameter was . Steam pressure was 125PSI. Each steam engine was coupled to a multi-pole, compound-wound dynamo supplied by the General Electric Company (GE) of Schenectady, New York. Each dynamo (generator) was rated at at 550 volts direct current (1545 amperes) and could be overloaded by up to 50 percent to satisfy peak demand. To cater to the growing demand of the electrified tram network, the engines were frequently run at . Each tram had less than worth of motors, but the original installation did not allow for growth. It followed that expansion of the power station beyond the initial four units was planned from the beginning.
Steam was initially supplied by 14 horizontal multi-tubular under-fired fire tube boilers by G. & C. Hoskins, Sydney. Each was rated at and operated at a pressure of .The boilers were hand fired and had natural draught to a single chimney at the end of the building. Only twelve boilers were needed to provide sufficient steam for full capacity power generation, leaving two in reserve.
The original generating units were removed in 1915 and 1916, but some of the boilers were retained (see below).
First Alternators - 6600 V, 25 Hz.
Alternators were brought into use from 1902, starting with three 1500 kW/6.6 kV units supplied by GE. Each alternator was powered by an Allis Reynolds vertical cross compound condensing reciprocating steam engine rated at 2500 hp at 75 rpm. Hp cylinder diameter was 32" and the LP cylinder diameter was 64" with a 60" stroke. The forty pole alternators generated three phase current at 25 cycles per second (Hz).
Alterations to the boiler house at this stage saw six of the original boilers removed. Then 8 Babcock and Wilcox long drum, chain grate boilers were added. Steam pressure was 160 PSI and superheaters gave a final temperature of 466 deg F. As more generators were installed an additional twenty four new boilers from Babcock & Wilcox (UK), each rated at 450 hp at 160 lb/sq in were added. By 1904 a total of thirty two B&W boilers were then on site.
Provision (foundations) was made for the addition of three more reciprocating steam engine-alternator sets, but this was abandoned in favour of turbo-alternators.
Vertical engine nos 5, 7 and 9 were removed between 1912 and 1914 after the addition of turbo-alternators.
Turbo-Alternators - 6600 V, 25 Hz.
The first turbo-alternator was brought into use at Ultimo Power Station on 9 January 1905. Supplied by C.A. Parsons & Company of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, the steam turbine was rated at 3000 hp, ran at 1500 rpm and drove an 1875 kW alternator at 50 Hz. Another 2.5 MW generator was installed in 1905. They were numbered 1 and 2, and replaced the first two horizontal engines. The DC section was finally closed down in 1914 and the remaining horizontal engines replaced with two more 2.5 MW Dick-Kerr turbines and numbered 3 and 4. The turbines were fed steam raised in sixteen new Babcock & Wilcox (UK) boilers, bringing the total number of boilers on site to forty eight. These boilers were placed on top of the 32 original boilers.
Two additional turbo-alternators were brought into use in 1909. Supplied by C.A. Parsons & Company, each was rated at 5000 kW with an overload capacity of 7500 kW and generated three phase alternating current at 50 Hz. They were numbered 10 and 12. Twelve new Babcock & Wilcox (UK) superheated boilers were added in 1910, again placed on top of the original boilers. The remaining eight fire-tube boilers were replaced by larger Babcock & Wilcox units in 1912/13.
In 1911 a 5 MW 25 Hz Willans Dick-Kerr turbo-alternator was installed with a similar 5 MW machine added in 1913. These machines replaced the vertical generators and were numbered 5 and 8.
In 1914, a Dick, Kerr turbo-alternator rated at 7 MW with an overload capacity of 10.5 MW was brought into use at Ultimo as unit No.7. This unit had originally been intended for installation at White Bay Power Station, and it was transferred there in 1918.
In 1929, work began to replace the sixty small boilers with six larger units operating at 350 lb/sq in and rated at 110,000 pounds of steam per hour. Steam outlet temperature was 700 deg F. The new boilers were the first to burn pulverised coal in any power station in New South Wales. Flue gasses were directed up the two brick chimneys built in 1902. Accompanying the new boilers were two 20 megawatt (MW) AGE-BTH turbo-alternators. They were numbered 1 and 2. This work was completed in 1931.
In 1941, two more boilers rated at 110,000 pounds of steam per hour, operating at a pressure of 400 lb/sq in, were brought into use. They were fitted with chain grate stokers and their flue gasses were taken away by two new short steel stacks. This was followed in 1942 by the commissioning of a third 20 MW turbo-alternator.
In 1948, the two 5000 kW Parsons turbo-alternators Nos 10 and 12 were removed. In 1949, their space was taken by a single 18.75 MW unit manufactured by English Electric (Australia), which had been unit No.4 at White Bay Power Station since 1924. This 18.75 MW set became No.3 at Ultimo and went into production about 1951. This brought the total installed capacity of Ultimo to its maximum of 79.5MW.
In 1948/49 the boilers were modified to allow the burning of furnace oil owing to coal supply shortages.
Control of Ultimo Power Station was transferred from the Department of Railways, New South Wales to the newly formed Electricity Commission of New South Wales on 1 January 1953.
The Sydney Railway and Tramway Power Grid.
The Sydney railway and tramway power grid consisted of Ultimo and White Bay Power Stations, which were linked by a 6600 volt transmission network and fed railway and tramway sub-feeder stations.
Following the initial 600 volt direct current (DC) installation, Ultimo Power Station supplied three phase alternating current (AC) at 6600 volts, 25 cycles per second. Originally, this current was not stepped up for transmission. Rotary converters were used to convert the three phase AC to 600 volts DC for the tram supply. The 1500 volt DC heavy rail electrification commenced operation in 1926 and also initially utilised high capacity rotary converters.
A 25–50 Hz frequency changer was installed at White Bay in 1939, allowing power generated at the two railway power stations to be fed into the Sydney County Council's 50 Hz grid as required.
The gradual elimination of electric trams from Sydney reduced the demand on the 25 Hz grid. In 1959, it was decided to abandon 25 Hz generation altogether.
Decommissioning.
Following the closure of the Sydney tram network in 1961, Ultimo Power Station was decommissioned in 1963.
The building was later recycled as the Powerhouse Museum, and more details of its history are provided there.

Camoufleurs

A camoufleur is a person who designed and implemented military camouflage in one of the world wars of the twentieth century. The term was originally a person serving in a First World War French military camouflage unit. In the Second World War, the British camouflage officers of the Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate, led by Geoffrey Barkas in the Western Desert, called themselves "camoufleurs", and edited a humorous newsletter called "The Fortnightly Fluer". Such men were often professional artists. The term is used by extension for all First and Second World War camouflage specialists. Some of these pioneered camouflage techniques. This list is restricted to such notable pioneers of military camouflage.
Surrealist artist Roland Penrose wrote that he and Julian Trevelyan were both "wondering how either of us could be of any use in an occupation so completely foreign to us both as fighting a war, we decided that perhaps our knowledge of painting should find some application in camouflage." Trevelyan later admitted that their early efforts were amateurish. Working in camouflage was not a guarantee of a safe passage through the war. Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola's "Section de Camouflage", founded in September 1914 in the French army, developed many new techniques, some of them highly dangerous, such as putting up artificial, camouflaged trees at night to replace actual trees with cramped observation posts. The cubist painter André Mare was wounded while preparing one such observation tree. Fifteen of his camoufleur colleagues were killed during the First World War.
Some camoufleurs such as Solomon J. Solomon, aged 54 at the start of the First World War, believed that artistic skill was necessary for the design or construction of effective camouflage. He wrote that "the camoufleur is, of course, an artist, preferably one who paints or sculpts imaginative subjects... He must leave no clues for the detective on the other side in what he designs or executes, and he must above all things be resourceful. But his imagination and inventiveness should have free play".
Not all the camoufleurs were artists. John Graham Kerr and Hugh Cott were zoologists, though Cott was also a skilled illustrator. Both men believed passionately that effective disruptive camouflage was vital, especially in the face of aerial observation, but they had difficulty persuading authorities such as the British Air Ministry that their approach was the right one. At least one Royal Air Force officer felt that Cott's camouflage was highly effective, but, since it would demand the presence of a skilled artist for every installation, too costly to be practical.

Felice Bauer

Felice Bauer (18 November 1887 – 15 October 1960) was a fiancée of Franz Kafka, whose letters to her were published as "Letters to Felice".
Early life.
Felice Bauer was born in Neustadt in Upper Silesia (today Prudnik), into a Jewish family. Her father Carl Bauer (c. 1850–1914) was an insurance agent, her mother Anna, née Danziger (1849–1930) was the daughter of a local dyer. Felice had four siblings: Else (1883–1952), Ferdinand (called Ferri, 1884–1952), Erna (1885–1978) and Antonie (called Toni, 1892–1918). In 1899 the family moved to Berlin.
Felice began attending a "", a vocational school for commerce, but had to give it up in 1908 because her family could not afford it. From 1909 on, she worked as a stenographer at the Berlin record company Odeon. One year later, she moved to the Carl Lindström Company, a manufacturer of gramophones and "Parlographs", then the most advanced dictation machines. After a short while she was promoted. She worked in marketing and represented the company at trade fairs. In April 1915 she began working at the . She contributed substantially to the income of her family.
Kafka.
Felice met Franz Kafka in Prague on 13 August 1912, when he visited his friend Max Brod and his wife. Brod's sister Sophie was married to a cousin of Felice's; Felice was in Prague on a trip to Budapest to visit her sister Else. A week after the meeting, on 20 August, Kafka entered in his diary:
Soon after the meeting he began to send her almost daily letters, expressing disappointment if she did not respond as frequently. He dedicated to her his short story "" ("The Judgment", literally: The verdict), which he had written the night of 22 September 1912. They met again for Easter of 1913, and he proposed marriage in a letter at the end of July that year. The engagement took place on Pentecost Sunday 1914, in the presence of Kafka's parents and sister Ottla, but was broken a few weeks later, in August.
After difficult communication, again mostly in letters, and spending ten days together in Marienbad in July 1916, they met for a second engagement on 12 July 1917, planning to marry soon and live together in Prague. Suffering symptoms of the tuberculosis that was to lead to his death, Kafka broke the engagement again in December that year. She departed on 27 December.
She saved Kafka's more than 500 letters to her, which were published as "Letters to Felice"; her letters to him did not survive. Elias Canetti titled his book on the letters "Kafka's Other Trial / The Letters to Felice", referring to Kafka's novel "The Trial", which he describes as "a novel ... in which Kafka's engagement to Felice is re-imagined as the mysterious and menacing arrest of the hero". Michiko Kakutani notes in a review for "The New York Times", "Kafka's Kafkaesque Love Letters" that Kafka's letters have:
Later life.
In 1919, she was married to Moritz Marasse (1873–1950), a partner in a private bank in Berlin. They had two children, Heinz (born 1920) and Ursula (1921–1966). In 1931 they settled in Switzerland and then in 1936 in the United States. She ran a store selling knitting ware made by her and her sister Else. She sold her letters from Kafka to the publisher Salman Schocken in 1955. She died in Rye, New York.
The musician Adam Green is her great-grandson. In the 2012 BBC radio play "Kafka the Musical", Felice was played by Jessica Raine.
In the world premiere of Murray Gold's stage adaptation "Kafka the Musical" (produced by "Theatre Inconnu", in 2012), the character Felice was played by Holly Jonson.

2013 Super Rugby season

The 2013 Super Rugby season was the third season of the new 15-team format for the Super Rugby competition involving teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The tournament was won by the Chiefs, who defeated the Canberra-based Brumbies 27–22 in the competition final. For sponsorship reasons, this competition is known as FxPro Super Rugby in Australia, Investec Super Rugby in New Zealand and Vodacom Super Rugby in South Africa. Including the past incarnations as Super 12 and Super 14, this was the 18th season of the Southern Hemisphere's premier domestic competition. Conference matches took place every weekend from 15 February until 13 July – with a break between rounds 17 and 18 for internationals games – followed by the play-offs series that culminated in the final on 3 August.
The 2013 season saw the of South Africa enter the competition for the first time, having replaced the under-performing . The Kings achieved three victories in their inaugural tournament, but finished last following the regular season, and were defeated by the Lions in a two-leg play-off for a position in the South African conference for the 2014 season.
Competition format.
Covering 25 weeks, the schedule featured a total of 125 matches. The 15 teams were grouped by geography, labelled the Australian Conference, New Zealand Conference and the South African Conference. The regular season consisted of two types of matches:
The top team of each conference, plus the next top three teams in table points regardless of conference (wild card teams), moved on to the finals. The top two conference winners, based on table points, received first-round byes. In the first round of the finals, the third conference winner was the #3 seed and hosted the wild card team with the worst record, and the best wild card team hosted the second-best wild card team. In the semi-finals, the #2 conference winner hosted the higher surviving seed from the first round, and the #1 conference winner hosted the other first-round winner. The final is hosted by the top remaining seed.
In addition, a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off took place at the end of the season between the bottom team in the South African Conference and the , with the winner qualifying for Super Rugby in 2014.

Vindobona (train)

Vindobona (Latin for "Vienna") is a named passenger train which began service in 1957 between Berlin and Vienna via Prague, originally by way of the Franz Josef Railway via Tábor and Gmünd, later rerouted via the first Czech railway corridor, Brno and Břeclav. In recent years the route has been extended to run from Hamburg to Villach. In the period of normalization, domestic travel within Czechoslovakia was for some years completely forbidden, occasionally restricted to journeys between Děčín and Tábor.
The service began using a "FDt 50/51" diesel multiple unit running from Berlin Ostbahnhof via Dresden, Prague and Gmünd to Wien Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof. The FDt DMUs had already began running between Berlin and Prague 7 years earlier. The service was used primarily by West Berliners, diplomats and Scandinavians crossing East Germany, connecting from the night trains from Copenhagen ("Ostsee-Express") and Stockholm ("Saßnitz-Express"), and the shuttle train from Berlin Zoologischer Garten station in West Berlin. The service continued to be operated by DMUs until 1979, when it was replaced by a composition comprising an electric locomotive coupled with individual carriages. 
The original journey via Tábor took over 12 hours to complete from Berlin to Vienna. Later, the mainline via Brno became faster, and the train was rerouted, initially via Havlíčkův Brod and later via Pardubice and Česká Třebová along the first Czech international corridor, shortening the journey to 9 hours. The train also became categorised as a EuroCity service. "Vindobona" is currently the name of EuroCity trains 172 and 173 and as of 2010 runs from Villach Hauptbahnhof to Hamburg-Altona via Klagenfurt, Vienna, Brno, Prague, Dresden and Berlin.

<doc id="36604500" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36604500" title="Vacuum filler">
Vacuum filler

A vacuum filler is a machine used for filling pasty products. The pasty products are moved with the aid of a vane cell feed system under a vacuum.
Objective.
Levelling the weight of pre-packaged goods in the food sector, especially those involving viscous or pasty products, places extremely high demands on the reproducible accuracy of filling and portioning systems. In order to achieve this, technical and technological issues as well as product-specific characteristics have to be taken into account. In addition to the aforementioned factors, the requirements on the quality of an end product is a key issue when selecting or implementing a technical process solution. The development of vacuum filling machines has made it possible to fulfill both the technical and the quality-related requirements.
In the food sector, moving or transporting fluids is achieved with the aid of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, depending on the type of filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported with the aid of a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with feed augers, toothed wheel feed systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.
Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some non-food sectors. Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.
History.
The first vacuum filler was developed in the early 1960s. The technology has been refined since then.
Requirements/effects.
The pumpability of viscous or pasty products has a key effect on the reliable function of a vacuum filler. Filling products in the food sector can be characterised with the aid of various different properties related to their pumpability (“fillability”). They are either physical characteristics that can be measured directly or they are sensory attributes.
Gas content/density.
The gas content is also called the “air content”. The air content of a fluid is the percentage share of air that enters the fluid during grinding/mixing processes. This can be measured using special apparatus and has a direct relationship to the density of a fluid.
Compressibility.
The compressibility depends on the air content of a fluid. A high level of compressibility is linked to a high gas content in the fluid.
Viscosity.
Viscosity is a measure of the consistency of a fluid. The higher the viscosity, the higher the consistency of the fluid is (it is less fluid); the lower the viscosity, the lower the consistency of it is (more fluid). Highly-viscous filling products in the food processing industry are primarily found in the meat, bakery products and convenience food sectors. These highly-viscous substances are commonly referred to as being “pasty”. The fluidity is the basic requirement for the pumpability of a fluid. The viscosity can also be determined using suitable rheological measuring apparatus. In the food sector, the viscosity is primarily dependent on the fluid content of the filling product.
Temperature.
The temperature is a key factor for pumpability as it has a direct effect on the viscosity as well as on the product quality.
Texture, fibrousness, dimensions of the inserts.
Specific sensory characteristics of a filling product have a significant effect on the assessment of the fillability and compliance with the precise weight.
Weight accuracy.
With the help of modern filling technology in the food sector, accurate portioning with a difference of up to 1% in relation to the required volume of a portion can be achieved.
Mode of operation.
The key element of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the feed system mechanically via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell feed system move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The feed system moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the feed system. Each cell of the feed system has a particular volume. The portion is defined by the rotation distance of the rotor. The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the feed system cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.
Structure and technical requirements.
Vacuum fillers are primarily used in the food trade and in the food industry. Special criteria apply to the design of machines in the food sector due to specific hygiene standards and hygiene regulations. This includes, for example, ensuring that they are easy to dismantle, have level surfaces and seals that can be rinsed from the rear, no dead spaces, ergonomic shapes, a small range of parts and detectable materials/materials suitable for food use. Relatively aggressive ambient conditions, such as reactive detergents, reactive or abrasive filling media, intensive high-pressure cleaning and extreme ambient temperatures, are also faced.
Vacuum fillers are therefore made of a high proportion of stainless steel with a very robust design. Moving parts can be easily dismantled and can be cleaned individually.
In addition to the mechanical or design-related issues, complex electronic components in a vacuum filler also have to be taken into account.
Vane cell feed system with hopper.
The vane cell feed system mainly consists of a rigid pump housing with attached side plate that is fixed to the pivoting hopper, and a removable rotor with pump vanes and cam. Depending on the machine size there are various different sizes of vane cell feed systems with parts with appropriate dimensions. The hopper can be swivelled to clean and dismantle surfaces and parts that come into contact with filling product. The driven rotor with an appropriate number of slots is located in the pump housing, in which pump vanes form cells with defined volumes when the machine is closed, supported by the cam. Induced by the rotor movement when the machine is started, the cells move in the direction of the vane cell feed system outlet and therefore ensure that a defined product flow is achieved. The weight accuracy of a feed system is partially dependent upon the production precision of the parts and their degree of wear.
Vacuum system.
The cells are filled by evacuating the vane cell feed system. By applying a vacuum via a vacuum pump, the filling products are gently drawn out of the hopper into the feed system as soon as an evacuated cell moves underneath the hopper. The vacuum pump is protected by an integrated water separator. The level of vacuum can be set according to the filling product.
In addition to the feed effect, the filling product is simultaneously evacuated to a certain extent (approx. 2–4 %). This means that the air content of the filling product decreases and the filling product becomes denser.
Feeding.
The term feeding in the context of vacuum fillers refers to actively moving the filling media in the direction of the lower part of the hopper to support the vacuum approach within the hopper. Feeding is achieved by using moveable feeding augers with scrapers/rigid counter arms. The feeding auger is driven in synchronisation with the rotation of the rotors. Due to the special geometry of both augers and the parallel rotation movement, the filling product is moved vertically in the direction of the vane cell feed system. The required feed intensity depends on the viscosity of the media to be filled. Less active feed is needed with low-viscosity media than with high-viscosity product. There are therefore a variety of combinations or versions of the parts involved in the feeding process.
Machine base.
The machine base acts as the stand for a vacuum filler. For hygiene reasons, bases are made completely of stainless steel. The compact machine base is designed to ensure that it can be moved easily using lifting equipment.
Lifting device.
Lifting devices allow the hopper to be loaded using standard trolleys. They can either be fixed onto the vacuum filler or a mast type lifting device can be positioned separately next to the vacuum filler. Lifting devices can be driven hydraulically or electrically.
Control and drive systems.
A computer-aided control system is required for operating the various functions associated with a vacuum filler. Usually, several drives are integrated into the vacuum fillers for the various different applications. With the most modern generations of vacuum fillers, the drives are implemented by means of servo motors and appropriate bus systems.
Sealing devices.
To produce individual portions from homogenous product via a feed system, a “sealing device” is always required at the feed system outlet. This device separates portions and is controlled in synchronisation with the portion output. These devices could be linking devices for sausages, clippers for portionable sausages, dosing valves for tubs and cans, cutting devices for dough as well as forming equipment for dumplings.
Other feed system principles.
Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be equipped with various different feed systems. However in principle, the basic machine structure, with a hopper, vacuum system, feeding device, machine base, lifting device, control system and sealing device, is very similar. Depending on the application, each type of feed system has advantages and disadvantages.
Screw feed system with feed augers.
With a screw feed system, two counter-rotating screws form cells within a housing; they are moved in the direction of the pump when the screws are rotated. The filling product is again moved into the screw feed system with the aid of a vacuum and mechanical feeding devices.
Toothed wheel feed system.
An outer toothed ring is driven, rotating an inner toothed wheel with it. The toothed wheels form cell segments as they move against each other. The cell content is transported through the toothing and it is then voided and ejected in the outlet area.
Feeding via lifting cylinders.
Feeding via alternately moving lifting cylinders is the simplest feed system principle. The volume is defined by the geometry of the cylinders, and the portion size is determined by the number of strokes.
Hopper vacuum systems.
The additional creation of a hopper vacuum is a variation of the vacuum filler concept. The vacuum system is enhanced with an additional vacuum pump, specially designed for the hopper. The hopper is closed and is connected to an upstream reservoir. The vacuum present in the hopper allows filling product to be drawn into the filling machine from the reservoir. The filling product is also intensively evacuated.
Problems and their solutions.
Many problems may occur when filling viscous media. The problems are often product-specific and are revealed when the product to be filled takes on an a-typical appearance. Examples of this are an inhomogeneous product appearance with sausage goods or when inserts are ground too finely during the pumping process.
However commercial or legal problems can also arise, in the form of weight deviations or non-compliance with the specified quality regulations (e.g. the guidelines for meat products).
These problems are caused by a variety of influences, such as air content or viscosity being too high, insufficient feed volume in the feed system, temperature-related influences and mechanical influences such as friction and fragmentation.
The aforementioned problems can be eradicated by modifying upstream process steps, adapting recipes and making technical modifications.
Auxiliary devices.
Holding devices.
Holding devices in the field of sausage production are used for automatic sausage linking. A holding device comprises a rotating linking nozzle and an appropriate sausage casing brake. The movement of the linking nozzle is achieved by a drive integrated into the vacuum filler. The sausage casing brake ensures that the sausage casings are extracted evenly, thus creating equal portions.
Hanging lines.
Hanging lines in the field of sausage production are auxiliary devices for linking and hanging portions of sausage. In principle, the application is similar to that of a holding device, however significantly higher filling capacities can be achieved. Hanging lines are available with various different degrees of automation.
Cutting lines.
Cutting lines in the field of sausage production have the same basic structure as hanging lines. Cutting lines are used to chop linked strings of sausages into portioned sausages.
Clippers.
Clippers for the production of portioned sausages are used in conjunction with vacuum fillers. The filling product is taken from the vacuum filler and through a filling pipe connected to the clipper and an appropriate sausage casing brake, where it is portioned into appropriate casings. The portion is then sealed by the clipper with the aid of metal clips. Sometimes, loops for hanging the portions are also attached simultaneously. Strings of sausages as well as individual portions can be produced.
Forming devices.
Forming devices are used for the production of formed products, such as dumplings and burgers.
The filling product is filled via tubing with an attached separating device. The separating device and the portion output are synchronised in such a way that it is possible to form the filling flow. The separating devices can be diaphragms (which function in a similar way to a photographic iris diaphragm; opening and closing creates a round shape during portioning), forming blades that move against each other or simple wire cutters or blades. The portion is ejected when the separating unit is opened. The separating devices then close in synchronisation with the end of the portion. This synchronised, adjustable process allows various different shapes to be created. The products can be directly transported for packaging or for thermal treatment on conveyor belts.
Thermal treatment (drying, freezing, cooking, sterilising, maturing, steaming, smoking etc.) in the food sector is an umbrella term for setting and controlling ambient conditions, such as temperature, relative humidity, gas/air circulation and, possibly, air exchange, with the aim of increasing the shelf life of food or making it edible.
With these devices, the filling product is filled into forming dies (plastic mould that is filled to the base). The filled mould is “moved” away from the filling area, it is detached from the flow of product by means of a simultaneous clipping movement and then ejected mechanically or pneumatically into transportation containers or into thermal treatment media.
Co-extrusion systems.
Co-extrusion means the synchronous feeding of two or more product flows with the aim of producing filled products (e.g. meatballs with ketchup filling, sausages with mustard filling and potato dumplings with a meat filling). Two or more vacuum fillers are always required. Co-extrusion systems are available for the forming, clipping and linking applications.
ConPro systems.
ConPro systems (continuous production systems) are special continuous co-extrusion systems for producing sausages with alginate skin. With this application, two vacuum fillers are operated in synchronisation and their filling flows are combined into one continuous product flow. Further down the process, the continuous string is divided into individual portions or strings of portions. One vacuum filler pumps the filling product while a second one deposits the skin – a paste containing alginate – via an annular gap. This is solidified by means of a fixing solution containing calcium ions. Depending on the degree of automation, the portions can be hung or collated or transported further for continuous thermal treatment or packaging.
The most important advantage of the ConPro systems in comparison to traditional production methods is that sausage skins or casings no longer have to be changed. Due to continuous co-extrusion there are no casing change times and therefore the filling time is maximised.
Inline grinding systems.
In the meat processing industry, grinding systems are used for grinding meat and are to be found ahead of the filling process in the product preparation phase. With inline grinding systems, a grinding system is integrated into the vacuum filler’s filling flow as an auxiliary device. The filling and grinding process steps can therefore be combined in a single machine. This means that the filling product is moved by the vacuum filler and, during filling, it is chopped to the final grain size within the grinding system. An important application for inline grinding systems is dry sausage or fresh sausage production.
Minced meat lines.
Minced meat lines are a combination of vacuum fillers, inline grinding systems and devices for separating the minced meat flow into individual portions. A continuous, formed product flow is filled onto a conveyor belt and a cutting blade divides the filling flow into portions. The portions can then be packed straight away.
Filling flow dividers.
A filling flow divider can separate a single product flow from a pump into several equal flows. Feed systems similar to a vane cell feed system are integrated into filling flow dividers. Filling flow dividers are required, for example, for simultaneous depositing into several containers.
Valves.
Valves or cutting devices are used as sealing devices at the end of tubing or filling flow dividers.
Weight control and process documentation.
Multi-machine electronic control and documentation systems are used to document a filling process involving vacuum fillers or to monitor filling weights.

Kentrigg

Kentrigg is a northern suburb of Kendal, Cumbria, England. By road, Kentrigg is located north of the centre of Kendal and southeast of Burneside. It contains the Carus Green Golf Club, which separates it from Burneside just to the northwest. Across the River Kent to the east is the Shap Road Industrial Estate, north of the district of Mintsfeet and the Mintsfeet Industrial Estate which marks the southeastern side of Kentrigg. 
The area contains a number of cottages which are let out to tourists. Helsfell Hall was the seat of the Briggs family which dominated the area in the 16th and 17th centuries up to the English Civil War. The old hall today is a Grade II listed building. 109 Burneside Road, also known as Aikrigg End, is a Grade II listed building, dated to the 18th and early 19th century. Kendal Fell lies to west of Kentrigg.
History.
Historically, the Briggs and Philipson (Phillipson) families dominated this area of northwest Kendal, which was under the parish of Kirkbie. A Christofer Philipson of Hollin Hall, near Crook (several miles to the northwest of Kentrigg), is documented in a will dated 20 May 1566 to have given Rolland Phillipson and his male heirs "lands I purchased of Mr. Heskett" in this area. Around 1581, the son of Robert Philipson married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Briggs of Helsfell Hall and subsequently had five sons and two daughters.During the English Civil War in the 1640s, the Briggs family, who were Parliamentarians (Colonel Edward Briggs was a magistrate), clashed with their cousins, The Philipsons, who were strict Royalists. During the Siege of Carlisle, Colonel Briggs besieged Robert Philipson's Belle Isle on Lake Windermere for eight to ten days. Robert Philipson is documented as having searched Kendal Church for his cousin Edward Briggs while he was at prayers on a Sunday morning with "the object of killing his cousin" in retaliation. The dominance of the area by the Briggs family ended after the civil war when the Philipsons stripped the family of their possessions, Robert Philipson taking ownership of the Colonel Brigg's seat at Helsfell Hall. The hall is mentioned in Cornelia Nicholson's "The Annals of Kendal" who documents that the seat of the Briggs family was "once a place of considerable importance."
In 1936, 1380 yards of cast-iron and stoneware pipe sewers were built in Kentrigg. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Kentrigg and Burneside became a part of the South Lakeland district, its capital at Kendal.
The area has developed in recent decades from farmland with new housing estates and the development of the Mintsfeet Industrial Estate and the Shap Road Industrial Estate, across the River Kent. Tourism For All UK, a notable Cumbrian tourist operator, has their headquarters on the Shap Road estate. The River Mint drains into the Kent near here. South of the industrial estate is a park, known as the Jubilee Playing Fields.
A housing development named Kentrigg Walk was developed along the banks of the River Kent in the 1980s, containing 8 large detached houses. In 1994 the Kentrigg West Action Group (KWAG) was formed to object to further housing development of some 300 houses on 15.5 hectares of farmland. The lobbying by the local group managed to reduce the housing development to 150 houses, when a public inquiry in 1996 rejected proposals by the South Lakeland District Council to further develop the Low Sparrowmire fields. In April 2008, the council submitted a new proposal to build 400 houses a year, some 8880 houses in the northwest area of Kendal up to the year 2025. The local Steering Group appealed to MP Tim Farron and local councillors, primarily concerned with the affect the development would have on the area known as the Green Gap, an agricultural strip between Hallgarth housing estate and Carus Green on Burneside Road. More than 210 people signed the petition in support of KWAG.
Carus Green Golf Club was established in 1997 when farmer Fred Downham converted his farmland into an 18- hole golf course. The multi-million pound development created 5 new jobs and has since attracted over 100 members. The Par 70 course measures 5860 yards, and the River Kent, Mint and River Sprint meander across the course. The course is managed by Graham Curtin. Several artifacts were unearthed during the building of the golf course.
Landmarks.
Kentrigg House on Burneside Road has been used as the clubhouse of the Carus Green Golf Club since 2011. It hosts golf seminars and product launches, as well as county events, and has a bar, restaurant, function suite and four apartments. Local concerns were raised that the clubhouse might cause disturbances in the area and function as a nightclub, but soundproofing measures have been implemented at the house.
109 Burneside Road, also known as Aikrigg End, is a Grade II listed building. It is dated to the 18th and early 19th century. The roof is hipped with a graduated slate roof and gabled porch on the south side. It is 2 storeys high, with 3 bays and a panelled door. The area also contains numerous cottages which are let out to tourists, such as the Old Woolyard and Low Plumgarths Farmhouse, about a mile from Kentrigg. Architect W. A. Nelson designed two of the houses along Burneside Road. Also of note is Hallgarth Cottage and Helsfell Hall off the A5264 road beyond the Hallgarth estate to the west of Kentrigg, Cherry Tree Cottage, Elm Court, and The Oddfellows Arms pub. The old 16th century Helsfell Hall is located in a field high above the A5264, becoming a Grade II listed building in 1984.

This was the inaugural season of the East Africa Premier league. It was totally dominated by the two Ugandan sides: The Rwenzori Warriors and Nile Knights, who took the first two places in the group stage, with the final being contested between the two sides. Heavy rain and showers in Nairobi led to the postponement of both the finals of the Premier League and Cup. After three postponements, the final was contested in late January 2012, which crowned the Nile Knights champions over the Rwenzori Warriors.
The inaugural tournament was a success, with both the East African competitions being up and running, according to then Cricket Kenya Chief Executive Tom Sears. It had some superb competitive cricket, with nearly every team holding an edge over the other. The East African competitions has proved to be a yardstick for national selection, with good performers being called up.

CU Conformity Certificate

In order to provide the Russian citizens with safety of life and health many kinds of production must have proof of conformity in different certification systems. For that purpose different means of certification are used:
Nowadays the main controlling structure on the territory of Russia is Gosstandart. But as many norms that earlier were required to production from the RF GOST were developed many decades ago they often do not meet the modern requirements any more.
The need for the Certificate.
With this connection, after the Customs Union was founded, the operation of controlling many goods saw a number of changes. The newly appeared procedure is performed in accordance with the Technical Reglaments. The similar normative acts are drawn up with consideration of needs of recent customers on the base of international standards. Development of Technical reglaments is performed by the Commission of the CU. Nowadays there are the normative only for certain categories of production. Nevertheless, in the future it is planned to enforce in the countries of the Customs Union certification procedures on the base of the Technical Reglaments only.
The Goal of the Certificate.
The goal of such radical changes is the more quality and poly-aspect research of the produced and realized production as well as creation the unified trading zone on the territory of certain states. Such kind of changes must meet not only customer’s interests, but also the interests of the production manufacturers. The advantage of such document as the Customs Union certificate is that it may be used in any state that is a member of the Customs Union. It allows open wide perspectives for the manufacturers by organizing business, because due to such a document there is a possibility of transportation of the production on the territory of the CU without paying the customs tax and without complex customs procedures.
The stages of the procedure.
In order to receive the Customs Union Certificate it is necessary to apply the certification center that is authorized and to go through the procedure of control consisting of the following stages:
It should be noted that the Customs Union Certificate is a quite important certification document which is obligatory for any kind of production. After drawing up such a paper, entrepreneurs are allowed to legally manufacture their production, to perform its transportation and realization on the whole territory of the Customs Union.
The Detailed Description.
The CU Conformity Certificate may be replaced by a national permissive document.
The Legislation of the Customs Union started its action in 1 July 2012. At the initial stage the evaluation of conformity was performed within the frameworks of the unified sanitary rules of the CU. But already at that time it was possible to draw up the voluntary Customs Union Conformity Certificate. On the 7th of April 2011 there was a decision by the KTS № 620 that approved the list of the production for obligatory certification with drawing up the unified Customs Union Conformity Certificate.
The Customs Union Conformity Certificate may be drawn up in the body of conformity evaluation that is authorized within the national certification system and included into the state registry of the CU certification bodies. The procedure of drawing up of such a permissive document is usually initialized by the applicant himself by applying to the CU certification body. Also it is obligatory to enclose the documents required in accordance with the legislation and the samples of production if the goods have not gone through the laboratory research.
The certification tests are performed on the base of the contract between the applicant and the testing laboratory that has the National Attestation of Accreditation for performing the certification researches of the required kinds of production listed in the state registry of the research laboratories of the CU and that have the right to perform the measurements by drawing up the unified Conformity Certificate of the Customs Union. 
The specialists of the certification body provide assistance to the applicant in selecting the appropriate according to the CU legislation scheme of proving conformity of the production. Next, they perform the analysis of the documentation presented to the certification body; they make sure in its sufficiency, absence of controversies and correctness of all the stated information.
On the base of the certification researches protocol of the certification body the expert makes a conclusion about the conformity or unconformity of the evaluated production to the certain requirements of the KTS № 620 decisions. Along with this the protocol of tests must include the actual indicators of all the characteristics that are required for proving in accordance with the regulating document. If the expert makes sure that all the actual characteristics of the researched indicators conform the frameworks of the limits, in this case he may make conclusion of Conformity of the production to the requirements of the CU legislation and to draw up the unified CU Conformity Certificate.
Then comes the state of the state registration of the CU Conformity Certificate in the unified registry of the given permissive documents. Only it’s entering into the unified list and giving it the registration number means the final stage after which comes the transfer of the CU Conformity certificate to its owner. 
The validation term of the unified Customs Union Conformity Certificate depends on the selected scheme of evaluating conformity proof, on the kind of production, presence or absence at the applicant-manufacturer the certificate of the system of management in the enterprise that proves its obeying to the requirements of the ICO 9010 standards and other factors.
The unified forms of the permissive documents of the CU were approved by the decision of the KTS № 563 of 2 March 2012. In the frameworks of the given regulating documents there is an approved unified Customs Union Conformity Certificate and the unified CU declaration.
The customs legislation means the possibility of replacing the procedure of receiving the unified Customs Union Conformity Certificate by drawing up the permissive document within the frameworks of the national certification system, acting on the territory of the Union.
But it should be taken into consideration that the CU legislation provides a number of details important for the applicant in comparison with the permissive documents drawn up in the system of obligatory state certification of the RF GOST R.
The unified Customs Union Conformity Certificate acts on the territories of all three states of the Union, while the permissive national documents allow the production the right of the legal turnover only on the territory of the country where the certificate was drawn up. In the case of the GOST R I is the territory of the Rf. The CU conformity Certificate may be drawn up for the serial production for the period up to 5 years. But the GOST R certificate has the maximum term of action – 3 years.
The unified Customs Union Conformity Certificate as well as the national conformity certificates may be drawn up as well as in obligatory form ( for the production included into the decisions of the KTS № 620) and on the voluntary base for any kind of production including the goods for which it is necessary the obligatory CU Conformity Certificate.
If the production requires obligatory drawing up the CU Conformity Certificate so the given condition covers not only the production manufactured in the Union countries but for the foreign goods too. Along with this if the Russian issuer of the Unified Customs Union Conformity Certificate for the goods by its import into the CU countries, there is no necessity to draw up the additional conformity certificate. 
By importing into the territory of the countries members of the Union of foreign goods the CU Conformity Certificate is obligatory till the moment of crossing the border of the Customs Union.
It will be obligatory to draw up the CU Conformity Certificate for different kinds of production until there is the CU legislation introduces it in the form of Technical Reglament.

Peter Milton Walsh

 
Peter Milton Walsh is an Australian singer-songwriter and guitarist best known for his band, The Apartments.
Pre-Music Career.
Walsh left school at 15 to join the Stardust Circus in which he developed his acoustic guitar technique through playing Irish, English and American folk music. With the proceeds from his earnings, he travelled to Morocco and from there moved to London as a boat painter's brush-hand for the socialite Lord Torrington.
The Apartments.
From his experiences in the carny, he began to rekindle his interest in guitar playing, and established a four-piece band The Apartments, adopting their name from the 1960 film, The Apartment. The Apartments performed around Brisbane between 1978 and the following year before breaking up in October. In that time, the band recorded an EP, "Return of the Hypnotist"; with its title drawing inspiration from one of the Stardust Circus's sideshow acts. Between November 1978 and January 1979, Walsh was the 4th member of fellow Brisbane band, The Go-Betweens where he played lead guitar over the summer whilst concurrently playing in The Apartments. During that short period of time, his guitar work made its way to a couple of recordings made for the Berserkley label in Great Britain.
The 1980s to Present.
In January 1980, Walsh decided to quit music and moved to New York City after feeling disillusioned with the Punk Scene in Brisbane. It was there where he was involved in a high-speed collision whilst taking up his new (and short-lived) post as a chauffeur driver for The New Yorker's staff writer, Janet Malcolm.
Since 1984, Walsh reformed The Apartments where he continues to sporadically record and perform from his Sydney base.

Kongonis went all the way to becoming champions, although the final was postponed two times due to rain and heavy showers in Nairobi, the venue of the final, as they scored 280/5 in their first innings (Rakep Patel 92, Duncan Allan 65), and young Kenyan rookie Mithesh Sanghani getting 19 wickets despite his team, Rift Valley Rhinos were eliminated in the group stage. While one of the Ugandan teams, Rwenzori Warriors were eliminated in the league phrase, the other team, Nile Knights were quite soundly defeated by Kongonis in the final. This turned out to be a boost for Kenya, as new, young, fine talent like Sanghani and Peter Kituku were unearthed and were called up to the national team.
The inaugural tournament was a success, with both the East African competitions being up and running, according to Sears. It had some superb competitive cricket, with nearly every team holding an edge over the other. The East African competitions has proved to be a yardstick for national selection, with good performers being called up.

Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis

Johannes Gijsbertus de Casparis (31 May 1916, Eemnes - 19 June 2002, Wassenaar) was a Dutch orientalist and indologist.
Early years.
After attending Barlaeus Gymnasium in Amsterdam, De Casparis started piano study at the conservatory of Amsterdam. However, a year later, in 1934, he turned to classical languages with Russian as a minor at the University of Amsterdam. Barend Faddegon was teaching Sanskrit in Amsterdam and under his influence, de Casparis switched to Sanskrit. In 1935, the archaeologist Willem Frederik Stutterheim of the Oudheidkundige Dienst in Nederlandsch-Indië (Archaeological Service in the Netherlands Indies) gave a lecture at the University of Amsterdam at which time he advised de Casparis to transfer to Leiden to continue his studies because the Oudheidkundige Dienst was looking for an epigrapher to replace Roelof Goris. Accordingly de Casparis registered for Indology at the University of Leiden in 1936. He excelled as a student and quickly passed his examinations in Sanskrit (with Jean Philippe Vogel), Avestan (with J. H. Kramers), archaeology and ancient history (with N. J. Krom), Old Javanese (with Cornelis Christiaan Berg), and Malay (with Ph. S. van Ronkel). Moreover he forged lifelong friendship with Raghu Vira, Durga Prashad Pandey and Senarath Paranavitana. de Casparis was appointed as Vogel's assistant and in 1939, at the age of 23, graduated. His thesis presented a new interpretation of the Sanskrit inscription of Dinoyo of CE 760. 
Indonesia and the Second World War.
On 3 August 1939 De Casparis was appointed epigrapher to the Oudheidkundige Dienst in Batavia. Arriving at the Netherlands Indies, De Casparis was welcomed by Stutterheim and with him toured through Central Java and East Java. After ten months at the Oudheidkundige Dienst in Batavia, however, his position was abruptly terminated. With the imperial Japanese threat, he was called up on 2 July 1940 to serve as a cryptographer in the Dutch colonial army (KNIL) and in the same year Louis-Charles Damais succeeded him as acting epigrapher. In early 1942, the Japanese invaded the Indonesian archipelago and De Casparis was taken prisoner, labouring on the Burmese railway. Together with H. R. van Heekeren, P. Voorhoeve, Chris Hooykaas, his close friend the Sinologist Marius van der Valk, and the Dutch entertainer Wim Kan, he survived the labour camps. By the end of the war De Casparis was fluent in Japanese. For a year after the Japanese surrender, he travelled through Thailand and visited archaeological sites. He stayed in Kanchanaburi, and learned Thai, and studied the inscriptions of Ram Kamhaeng. In August 1946, De Casparis returned to the Netherlands as a second lieutenant in the air force. At this time, some seven years after first meeting his future wife in France while en route to Batativa, he married Gisèle Marie Fongaro, an Italian-born Frenchwoman. 
Return to Indonesia.
The Renville Agreement paved the way for de Casparis's return to the archipelago in 1948 and a year later, his wife and young daughter Anna (born 1947) followed him to Jakarta. Damais was reappointed acting epigrapher in 1945, but in September 1947 he returned to France. As of November 1947, August Johan Bernet Kempers headed the Oudheidkundige Dienst and on 17 April 1948, De Casparis again took up his post as epigrapher. On 14 November he defended his PhD thesis on the inscriptions from the Śailendra period at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta. Politically committed to Indonesia's struggle for independence, De Casparis met Soekarno, who showed an interest in archaeology and had established an independent Republican archaeological service (Dinas Purbakala) in Yogyakarta. In 1950, this replaced the Oudheidkundige Dienst. Meanwhile, the Oudheidkundige Dienst had started training Indonesians; R. Soekmono studied with Bernet Kempers who promptly made Soekmono his successor in 1953 after the latter's graduation. Boechari became de Casparis's student in epigraphy. In 1955, de Casparis became professor in the early history of Indonesia and Sanskrit at a branch of Airlangga University (Surabaya) in Malang. In the same year he also gave courses as visiting professor of the history of South and Southeast Asia at Universitas Adityawarman, founded by Mohammad Yamin in Batusangkar, Sumatra. Because of these duties de Casparis stayed in Jakarta for another year before moving to Malang with his family. 
Return to Europe.
Anti-Dutch sentiment in Indonesia was mounting and although de Casparis would have liked to become an Indonesian national, for the sake of the education of his three daughters, Anna, Françoise (born 1950), and Claire (born 1952), the family decided to return to Europe in 1958 when he was offered a position as lecturer in the early history of South and Southeast Asia at SOAS. He was promoted to reader in 1961. At SOAS, De Casparis worked with Chris Hooykaas, reader in Old Javanese, on the textual comparison between the Sanskrit "Bhattikavya" and the Old Javanese "Kakawin Ramayana".
In 1978 De Casparis returned to Leiden to become professor of the early history and archaeology of South and Southeast Asia at the Department of Languages and Cultures of South and Central Asia (Kern Institute). After 39 years away from the Netherlands, and with a family that did not speak Dutch, he did not feel entirely at home in the formal setting of Dutch academia. Nonetheless his Leiden period was fruitful in terms of publications and the number of students he produced. During his London period, De Casparis had been invited by the University of Hawaii as visiting professor and in 1983 returned to Hawaii to occupy the Burns Chair of History while retaining his Leiden post. After his retirement in 1986 at the age of 70, De Casparis remained active and exercised his right to supervise PhD dissertations to 1991. Many of his students were from Sri Lanka, and this led to his being awarded a Doctor of Letters, "honoris causa", by the University of Peradeniya on 22 December 1990. He remained active after his wife died in 1998 and had hoped, in 2000, to return to Indonesia to study the inscriptions at Wadu Paa. He was unable to make the trip, but continued, nonetheless, to work on the inscriptions of Siṇḍok until his death in 2002.

Amarantoraphidia

Amarantoraphidia is an extinct genus of snakefly in the family Mesoraphidiidae. The genus is solely known from Early Cretaceous, Albian age, fossil amber found in Spain. Currently the genus comprises only a single species Amarantoraphidia ventolina.
History and classification.
"Amarantoraphidia ventolina" is known only from one fossil, the holotype, specimen number CES 364.1. The specimen is composed of a mostly complete adult insect with the wing tips missing. The apical third of the right hind-wing is also gone and the left front most leg has been disarticulated. The specimen is included in a piece of amber with plant debris and a number of other insects, such as a thysanopteran, hymenopterans. and dipterans. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the Escucha Formation in Moraza, part of the Province of Burgos in Northern Spain. "Amarantoraphidia" was first studied by group of paleoentomologists lead by Ricardo Pérez-de la Fuente of the University of Barcelona and including Enrique Peñalver, Xavier Delclòs, and Michael S. Engel. Their 2012 type description of the new genus and species was published in the electronic journal "ZooKeys". The genus name "Amarantoraphidia" was coined by the researchers as a combination of the snakefly genus "Raphidia" and the Greek "amarantos" meaning "ageless" or "that never fades". The specific epithet "ventolina" is a reference to the Cantabrian mythologies ventolines. These were said to be cheerful air beings with warm green wings which helped fishermen when summoned. "Amarantoraphidia ventolina" is one of six described snakefly species found in the Albian deposits of Cantabria.
Description.
The lone specimen of "Amarantoraphidia ventolina" is a fairly well preserved adult female. The hyaline forewings are partially preserved, displaying brown vein structuring that hosts robust setae, notably along the C-vein. The forewings are incomplete, with the tip beyond the end of the pterostigma not present. As such the overall length is estimated to have been in length and a maximum of in width. The pterostigma is elongated with a slightly infumate and a base closed by with a cross vein. Other than the basal cross vein the pterostigma is not crossed by any veins. Overall the legs show a striped pattern of dark and light patches. The tibia have three distinct dark patches while the femora have a light proximal half and darkened apical half. The integument is a dark brown in color. The abdomen is long and sports a robust ovipositor that has dense annulations along its length. The ovipositor is long, thick, and sports short, stiff, sensory setae along its length.

Kleč, Kočevje

Kleč (; in older sources also "Kleče", , also "Kletsch bei Altlack") is a settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now part of the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. It no longer has any permanent residents.
Name.
The origin of the name "Kleč" is uncertain. Snoj observes that settlements named "Kleč(e)" generally lie along rivers and he connects this with the Slovene common noun "kleč" 'sandy or gravely river bank; gravely area covered with thin soil', referring to the local geology. Bezlaj also mentions the possibility of derivation from *"klękъ" 'small branching hills'. Another possibility is that it is derived from "kleč" with the meaning 'cliff'. Petschauer suggests that the name is derived from "klet" with the meaning 'shed, shack'.
History.
Kleč was a Gottschee German village. In the land registry of 1574 it had four full farms divided into eight half-farms, corresponding to a population between 35 and 40. In the 1770 census there were 23 houses in the village. Kleč had a maximum population of 125 in 1880, which gradually decreased due to emigration. Before the Second World War, the village had 21 houses and a population of 89. At that time, the economy of the village was based on farming, making wooden tubs, troughs, shovels, and railway ties, selling firewood, lumber, and logs, and gathering berries. There was an inn in the settlement. The original inhabitants were evicted on 23 and 24 November 1941. In August 1942 Italian troops burned the village and now it is difficult to discern the traces of the former houses. The village was not rebuilt after the war, and the meadows were used by the Kočevje collective farm. Since about 1990 the farmland has been worked by the Robida family of Stari Log. A sign with information about the village in Slovenian, German, and English was erected at the site of the former church in 2012.
Church.
The church in Kleč was a chapel of ease dedicated to Saint Andrew. It stood at the southeast edge of the village. It probably dated to the mid-16th century and was mentioned in visitation records dating to 1753. It had a rectangular nave, a painted wooden ceiling, and a vaulted chancel walled on three sides. There was a square stone belfry. The church and its furnishings were burned in 1943. The site of the former church is registered as cultural heritage.

Triumphal cross

A triumphal cross (Latin: "crux triumphalis") is a monumental crucifix that forms part of the interior decor of medieval churches. It usually hangs between the choir and the nave within a triumphal arch, the entrance arch to the choir, or stands at the same spot on a transverse beam. If the choir is separated from the church interior by a rood screen, the triumphal cross is placed on, or more rarely in front of, the screen. Under the triumphal cross is usually the altar of the Holy Cross. The term "triumphal cross" signifies the triumph that the resurrected Jesus Christ ("Christus triumphans") won over death.
Changes to the image of Christ.
In the Romanesque era the crucified Christ was presented as ruler and judge. Instead of a crown of thorns he wears a crown or a halo, on his feet he wears "shoes" as a sign of the ruler. He is victorious over death. His feet are parallel to each other on the wooden support ("Four nail type") and not one on top of the other. The loincloth is highly stylized and falls in vertical folds.
In the transition to the Gothic style, the triumphant Christ becomes suffering Christ, the pitiful Man of Sorrows. Instead of the ruler's crown, he wears the crown of thorns, his feet are placed one above the other and are pierced with a single nail. His facial expression and posture express his pain. The wounds of the body are often dramatically portrayed. The loincloth is no longer so clearly stylized. The attendant figures Mary and John show signs of grief.
Triumphal crosses with attendant figures.
A triumphal cross may be surrounded by a group of people. These people may include Mary and John, the "beloved disciple" (based on John's Gospel (, , and ), but also apostles, angels and the benefactor.

Walter Lemcke

Walter E. Lemcke (19 August 1891 – 1955) was a German sculptor who mainly worked in bronze. He produced numerous sculptures for the Third Reich including the eagles holding swastikas that flanked the entrance of the Ministry of Aviation in Berlin. He is also remembered as being the designer of the first Olympic Torch, which carried the flame during the 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay.
Several of Lemcke's works remain today and are featured in parks and museums around Germany.
Works.
Third Reich eagles.
Lemcke produced numerous pieces that depicted eagles, the national symbol used by the Third Reich. Examples of these works include two large sculptures that featured at the newly built Ministry of Aviation office in Berlin. These eagles added to the Nazi symbolism of the building, themselves gripping swastikas and stood atop decorative columns. At the end of World War II the sculptures were removed from what is now the Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus.
Perhaps Lemcke's most significant eagle statue was the one that once stood on the roof of the Berlin Tempelhof Airport. Designed by Ernst Sagebiel and implemented by Lemcke, it stood at 4.5 m and was visible for many miles. Rather than holding a swastika in its claws, this sculpture grasped a large globe to symbolise the international aspect of the airport. The sculpture was cast in iron before being treated to appear bronze. In 1962 the statue was removed to make way for the installation of new radar equipment. The airport was closed in 2008 and the head is now located near to the entrance of the nearby Platz der Luftbrücke. This led to the area being named "Eagle Square".
Involvement in the 1936 Summer Olympics.
Lemcke designed the 27 cm wood and metal torches. German manufacturer Krupp produced 3,840 copies for the runners, over 500 more than would be needed. The shaft of the torch featured an eagle over the Olympic rings.
Along with the torch Lemcke sculpted a bell that was struck as part of the opening ceremony. The bell features the inscription "" (I summon the youth of the world).

Episode 4466

The 4466th episode of the BBC soap opera "EastEnders" was broadcast on BBC One on 23 July 2012, between 9pm and 9.30pm. It was written by Matt Evans, directed by Clive Arnold, and executively produced by Lorraine Newman. It included seven minutes of live footage, during which the character of Billy Mitchell, played by Perry Fenwick, carried the Olympic Torch as an official torch bearer as part of the official torch relay for the London 2012 Olympic Games, and Lola Pearce, played by Danielle Harold, gave birth to her daughter. The storyline for the episode was announced in November 2011, with the fact that Lola would give birth being reported in July 2012. The episode received positive reviews, with Ally Ross from "The Sun" enjoying it but pointing out several continuity errors, Karen Edwards from "Heat" calling it "special" and praising Harold's performance, and Jane Rackham from the "Radio Times" calling it "highly topical", though Boyd Hilton from "Heat" felt that Billy's torch bearing was a "gimmick" and the whole episode should have been live. It was watched by an average of 7.32 million people on its initial broadcast. It was accompanied by a special, one-off BBC Red Button episode called "Billy's Olympic Nightmare". The episode received an "All About Soap" award nomination for Best Episode, under the name "Billy and the Olympic Torch", and a British Soap Award nomination for "Spectacular Scene of the Year", both in 2013.
Plot.
Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) is due to be a torch bearer for the 2012 London Olympics, but is stuck on the London Underground with members of his local football team, due to someone pulling the emergency stop when an argument broke out. The train starts but police are waiting at the tube station and will not let them through. Billy manages to escape, and frantically tries to get ready for the torch. Meanwhile, Billy's granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), is in labour in a local fast food restaurant, refusing an ambulance, and refusing to give birth until she knows Billy has carried the torch and can be there. After some delays, Billy is able to carry the torch, watched by his friends and neighbours. He then hears that Lola is in labour, so rushes to the restaurant, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) delivers the baby.
Announcement.
In November 2011, storylines show Billy selected as a torch bearer for the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the same time, it was announced that in reality, Fenwick would carry the torch through the fictional setting of Albert Square, with live footage shown in the second episode on 23 July 2012. London 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe said: "The announcement is a great addition to the Olympic Torch Relay Route. I'm sure the people of Walford will now start planning their celebrations. Along with people right round the UK, the residents of Albert Square will be getting involved to make this their moment to shine." Fenwick said, "When we first discussed the storyline, my initial thought was that I'll now have to get fit. While this may be a fictional one-off for Billy, it's a real once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me and I am thrilled that Walford and Albert Square will be part of this amazing event." He later added: 
"I think it's great that "EastEnders" has done this storyline, because it would be totally wrong and remiss not to acknowledge the biggest event in our lifetime, which technically—in fictional land—is five minutes up the road from Walford." Roger Mosey, the BBC's director for London 2012, said, "I like this, in media terms, that it's the real torch, the real procession going to Walford. It will be live when it goes there and so potentially you can broadcast "EastEnders" for three or four minutes on the News Channel because the torch being in Albert Square is a news event. I like the idea of the real torch being in a fictional place."
On 15 July 2012, it was announced that a seven minute live segment at the end of episode would show Billy taking part in the relay, followed by Lola giving birth to her daughter, while Billy rushes to be there. Harold would become only the second actress to act out a birth during a live episode of a soap opera, following "Coronation Street's" Jennie McAlpine (Fiz Brown) in the live 50th anniversary episode broadcast in December 2010. An insider from the show stated, "No one has tried anything like this on "EastEnders" live before so it is a real challenge to get the emotion of the situation right. It will be the toughest thing Danielle has done in her acting career."
Production.
Carl Doran, the creative head of the Torch coverage across the BBC, revealed in a blog on BBC Online, that the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) and "EastEnders" production team had worked for two years to organise the flame being shown live on "EastEnders", saying "We've been looking into the practicalities and many challenges of getting the torch to Walford in time for an "EastEnders" slot while it makes a whistle-stop tour through London's 32 boroughs in the final week of the 70-day journey around the UK. We also discussed the idea of trying to record it on tape like a traditional "EastEnders" episode as well, but we always wanted it to be as authentic as possible and so it will be the real torch and flame and it will happen live. It's very exciting, and even more so because live broadcasting adds an extra set of challenges to a top drama."
Rehearsals for the live section of the episode started on 21 July and full dress rehearsals on 22 July, though there was some tentative rehearsal time before that when they were also busy filming other episodes. Fenwick said of his rehearsals, "Summer arrives just in time for me to complete my 24th circuit of Albert Square and I'm sweltering. On the plus side, I'm starting to see abs, have buns of steel and the show is looking good too!" He explained that he was inspired by Usain Bolt, saying, "I watched a documentary on him [...] and he's inspired me to torch bear. Obviously I won't be going near as fast him!" He had to check the route for potholes beforehand, as well as making sure he knew his lines, and said he was looking forward to it being over. He practiced the route at least 100 times, using washing line rope instead of the flame, and had cut down on alcohol to prepare. He was worried about sustaining an injury during rehearsals and about carrying the torch during the live broadcast, as he may have dropped it or it could have gone out. He stated that he, as an actor, was feeling more nervous than his character. 
Harold said of the rehearsals, "I have known about this live episode for such a long time but all of a sudden it has crept up on us. I am really nervous but now we have started rehearsing, I am feeling equally excited. It will definitely be an experience and I hope Perry runs smoothly!" She also said she was "terrified" of acting out the birth, saying she would prefer to give birth in real life. She said that filming the pre-recorded labour scenes meant she "was knackered after screaming and crying and pretending to push all day." In an interview with Digital Spy, she said that she was "really, really nervous" and that the prospect of acting the birth was "very scary", but added, "I really appreciate that they've given me the opportunity, especially considering that I haven't been here at "EastEnders" for that long. It's really nice that they've trusted me with it, so hopefully I'll do it justice! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll go well." To help prepare, she asked several women for advice, including her mother, and was told "It's the worst pain you can ever imagine!" She found it "quite difficult" to imagine what it would be live to act out as she has no children, but had watched Channel 4 show "One Born Every Minute" to help, as she did not want to "overdo the scene or make it look really fake."
The episode was part of the official torch relay, and Fenwick ran with the real torch protection team dressed as an official torch bearer. The torch made a special detour from London to the "EastEnders" set in BBC Elstree, Borehamwood. Fenwick's route saw him carry the torch from the fictional location of Bridge Street, past The Queen Victoria public house and around Albert Square. His part of the relay was 300 metres long, but he had to run across the set for the next scene. He explained that at one point, there are only 12 or 13 seconds between two of his scenes, so would have to run quickly between sets, saying that producers had been timing him. He said: "What the viewers won't see is the running around that I'm doing off screen. I've got to do sprints all the way through, they're actually timing me, and every day I'm beating my personal best. Because it's all about me getting from one set to another and getting all the words out in the right order and not falling over and not putting the torch out."
The majority of the episode was filmed in advance, and the whole epiosde was directed by Clive Arnold, who said, "As the only drama asked to be involved with the Olympic Torch Relay, it is a huge honour for "EastEnders" and for everyone involved—a truly once in a lifetime opportunity. I was so excited and thrilled when I was asked to be part of the episode and I know that every member of cast and crew feel exactly the same way." Fenwick revealed there were "strict rules about haircuts and all that because of continuity", saying that because of the warm weather when they filmed the pre-recorded section, he and Harold were "quite brown", so said they might have to use fake tan. The live scenes used 19 cameras, along with the 31 regular cast members, plus 11 child cast members and at least 450 extras. As the programme switched from pre-recorded to live scenes, Fenwick, in character, winked at the camera and said "Here we go!" Part of the relay was shown on BBC News.
"Billy's Olympic Nightmare".
"Billy's Olympic Nightmare" is a one-off spin-off episode of "EastEnders", broadcast via the BBC Red Button on 16 July 2012, to tie in with the episode where Billy is a torch bearer. This episode features Billy missing several promotional events. The episode stars comedian Omid Djalili as a cab driver named Hercules, plus athletes Kelly Holmes, Tessa Sanderson, Kriss Akabusi, Mark Foster, newsreader Sonali Shah, and television presenters Matt Baker and Alex Jones as themselves. Perry said of the spin-off, "Filming this was like a dress rehearsal of my worst nightmare! It was strange filming at West Ham as again, like Billy, I feel it's my home. I'm over the moon to be carrying the torch through Walford, and working with the likes of Dame Kelly Holmes has made me even more excited to do so!" Fenwick revealed that Djalili improvised some of his lines.
Reception.
Pre-broadcast.
Jane Rackham from the "Radio Times" called the episode "highly topical", while Tony Stewart from the "Daily Mirror" said: "With London hosting the Games, this is an appropriate and ambitious story for ["East"]"Enders" to tackle", and called both Fenwick and Harold "superb". Jaci Stephen from the "Daily Mail" questioned the choice of Billy for the torch, saying, "Many people have carried the Olympic torch—sports men and women, entertainers, individuals who have contributed something to their community—so why oh why did Walford choose Billy for the honour? Failed husband, failed father—heck, even failed criminal, it's hard to see how he will manage to do anything with it other than burn down Albert Square." Talking of the live insert, she said, "maybe is just so that Billy can ruin the thing for the whole nation, as opposed to just Walford." Boyd Hilton from "Heat" said Billy carrying the Olympic torch was a "gimmick", and said the entire episode should have been live, whilst "Heat" Karen Edwards said Harold acting out a live birth would be "amazing", adding, "much respect goes out to Danielle who will be working hard to make the episode a success."
Post-broadcast.
Ally Ross from "The Sun" gave the episode a mixed review, noting several continuity errors when the show went live, including Lola's hair being dyed, Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) being washed and longer, Shirley Carter's (Linda Henry) hair being undyed and restyled, and Lola having a spray tan. He commented: ""EastEnders" goes live and the makeover miracle of Albert Square is born." He said that character Alfie Moon "made the unfortunate transition into his very own Mr Hyde, Shane Richie" and said that the cast were shouting every line so they could be heard over the extras. However, he concluded that he enjoyed the episode more than any other, due to the Olympic occasion, the "used, abused and underrated" Billy being in the limelight, and "the fact that, for seven precious minutes, the arm-folding, door-slamming, crockery-smashing life-suckers actually had a smile on their miserable faces." Talking about Billy being stuck on the train, the "Elstree & Borehamwood Times" wrote: "Viewers sat biting their nails on tenterhooks, waiting to see if he would make it back to Walford in time." Karen Edwards from "Heat" called the episode "quite the special night" and said that it was "Not an easy task" for Fenwick. She called his wink "cheeky" and "brilliant", saying it "just showed how real the whole thing was". She added that it was "emotional" to watch, and said that Harold "did the best fake birth screaming we've seen in a long while. [...] Pretty impressive work, we're sure you'll agree." Matt Brito from Comedy Central UK said the fact that nothing went wrong in the live broadcast was "boring". Laura Morgan from "All About Soap" said the live segment was "seamless", saying it deserved a gold medal for "the best thing on TV last night". She said she loved Fenwick's wink to the camera and praised Harold, saying the birth finished off the live segment "perfectly", adding: "Hats off to relative newbie Danielle Harold (aka Lola) for making the birth scenes look so realistic on live TV... That's no mean feat!" She also said it was "the perfect way to kick off the 2012 Olympic Games". After the episode, five of the ten top trending topics on social networking site Twitter related to the live event.
Ratings.
Overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 7.32 million people, a 31% share of the total viewing audience for that time, and the live section peaked at 7.9 million (32.6%). A repeat on BBC Three received overnight ratings of 1.04 million (6.1%). However, this was down on the first episode shown that day, which received 7.59 million viewers, and rival soap opera "Coronation Street", whose two episodes broadcast on ITV that day received overnight ratings of 7.68 million and 7.8 million respectively. Official ratings from the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board showed that the episode gained 8.11 million viewers. It was the fourth most-watched programme on BBC One that week and the fifth most-watched programme on UK television that week, beaten by the previous episode of "EastEnders", the first episode of "Coronation Street" broadcast on that day, and the following Friday's broadcasts of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and opening ceremony countdown. The BBC Three repeat officially received 1.1 million viewers.
Award nominations.
In February 2013, the episode was nominated for an "All About Soap" award for Best Episode, under the title "Billy and the Olympic Torch". In April 2013, the episode was nominated for "Spectacular Scene of the Year" at The British Soap Awards, for Billy carrying the torch.

List of SpongeBob SquarePants guest stars

In addition to the show's regular cast of voice actors, guest stars have been featured on "SpongeBob SquarePants", an American animated television series created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. "SpongeBob SquarePants" chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Many of the ideas for the show originated in an unpublished, educational comic book titled "The Intertidal Zone", which Hillenburg created in the mid-1980s. He began developing "SpongeBob SquarePants" into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of "Rocko's Modern Life", which Hillenburg directed. The pilot episode first aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on May 1, 1999. The show's ninth season premiered in 2012, and episodes of "SpongeBob SquarePants" have aired. A feature-length film adaptation of the show, "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie", was released in 2004.
Guest voices have come from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. The first credited guest stars were "McHale's Navy" actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, who appeared in "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy," the show's sixth episode. Borgnine and Conway have since been featured as recurring characters on the show. Rock band Ghastly Ones were the first guest stars to appear as themselves, appearing for a special musical performance in the first season episode "Scaredy Pants." Aside from the aforementioned actors, actress Marion Ross has a recurring role as Grandma SquarePants, SpongeBob's grandmother. Borgnine has made the most appearances, guest starring 16 times. Conway has made 15 guest appearances, while Ross has appeared four times. Actors John O'Hurley and John Rhys-Davies have each appeared twice.
Hillenburg "deliberately avoided" inviting guest starts onto the show, saying that "we only would cast someone if they came right out of the story." A number of guest stars agreed to appear on the show after being convinced by their children who are "SpongeBob SquarePants" fans, while others accept because they are fans of the show themselves. Casting associate Sarah Noonan, who is responsible for casting guest stars on the show, has received three Artios Award nominations (with one win) from the Casting Society of America. , there have been 72 guest stars on the show, with this figure rising to 76 if "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie" is included.
History.
Guest stars have appeared on "SpongeBob SquarePants" since its first season, in addition to the main cast, consisting of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Carolyn Lawrence and Mr. Lawrence, and supporting cast of Jill Talley, Mary Jo Catlett, Lori Alan, Dee Bradley Baker, Brian Doyle-Murray, Sirena Irwin, Bob Joles, Mark Fite and Thomas F. Wilson. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg in point of fact eschewed appearances by celebrities on the show, stating in an early interview, "Honestly, I deliberately avoided that. "The Simpsons" is a tough act to follow, so I thought it was best not to do what they do," referring to the copious number of "The Simpsons" guest stars. He added, "But we've had a few exceptions." According to Tom Kenny, main character SpongeBob's voice actor, "One of the things networks always try to push is getting celebrities." He said, "But Steve had no interest in that and let them know that in no uncertain terms."
The first guest stars to appear on the show were actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway, reuniting for their first joint TV project in 33 years since the 1960s sitcom "McHale's Navy". They appeared as SpongeBob's favorite superheroes, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's creative director, enjoyed the actors' roles in "McHale's Navy", and they already wanted the two to provide the voices of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy when they were voice casting. Hillenburg and Drymon directly approached Borgnine and Conway, and the actors both accepted. When coming up for the right voice of Mermaid Man, Borgnine cracked his voice by mistake when he was saying "evil!" He said, "By golly! We started something... and we kept voice in." Rock band Ghastly Ones were the first guest stars to appear as themselves, appearing to perform the song "SpongeBob ScaredyPants" in the first season episode "Scaredy Pants." Their song was then released in the album "" in 2001. Actors Jim Jarmusch and John Lurie were the first guest stars to appear in live-action. They appeared as themselves in the first season episode "Hooky" via stock footage from the television program "Fishing with John". According to episode writer Vincent Waller, "Someone made us aware of the footage, and they graciously let us use it." The crew planned to film live-action scenes; however, "the Jarmusch and Lurie addition was a very nice surprise."
Several guest stars have made multiple appearances on the show. Borgnine guest starred in 16 episodes, more than anybody else. He voiced Mermaid Man, until his death in 2012. Following his death, Nickelodeon honored him with a two-hour "SpongeBob SquarePants" marathon featuring his character. Borgnine had found a renewed fanbase among children through his work on the show. Borgnine's former "McHale's Navy" co-star Conway has made over 15 guest appearances as Barnacle Boy, Mermaid Man's sidekick. Actress Marion Ross first appeared as Grandma SquarePants in the season two episode "Grandma's Kisses," and has since appeared in three other episodes. Actor John O'Hurley provides the voice of King Neptune, who first appeared in the first season episode "Neptune's Spatula," while John Rhys-Davies made his first appearance as Man Ray, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's nemesis, in the second season episode "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III." The two have each reappeared in "The Clash of Triton" and "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy V," respectively. Other guest repeat guest stars include Brad Abrell, Steve Kehela and Frank Welker.
Hillenburg said that "We only would cast someone if they came right out of the story," while Sarah Noonan, vice president of talent and casting for Nickelodeon, said that guest star choices come from the writing staff and executive producer. Writer Steven Banks said, "It's not just stunt casting to get publicity," and that the reasoning is "do want to meet them [..." A number of guest stars have accepted to appear on the show after being persuaded by their children who are "SpongeBob SquarePants" fans. Some of them include Victoria Beckham, Amy Poehler and David Hasselhoff. Others accept to guest appear because they are fans of the show themselves. Actor Johnny Depp, who appeared as Jack Kahuna Laguna in the sixth season episode "SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One," accepted the guest role on the show because he and his children are fans. Hillenburg described the process, "In the beginning, it was hard to get people. Most of the people that allow themselves to be on have kids who like the show. Often, they're kids are fans. They're doing it because they want to please the family." "SpongeBob SquarePants" has a "dream list" of celebrities that the crew would like to appear on the show, which includes actors Michael Caine and Jerry Lewis. Noonan said, "Let us know if you can help us out with them."
Many guest stars record their parts in the show's recording studio, although some are recorded over the telephone. Kenny joked, "With movie stars, sometimes they have to phone it in from their villa in France." When recording over the phone, some guest stars would do their parts in real time with the show's cast who are in the recording studio. Noonan received three Artios Award nominations from the Casting Society of America for her work on casting actors on the show. She was honored in 2011 in the Outstanding Achievement in Casting—Television Animation category. , there have been 72 guest stars, totaling 110 guest spots. These figures rise to 76 and 114 respectively if "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie" is included.

Frank Turner (gymnast)

Frank Conway Turner (5 November 1922 – 27 September 2010) was a British gymnast who took part in four Olympic Games, three as a competitor and the fourth as National Coach; he was captain of the British Gymnastics team in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Turner was four times British gymnastics champion.
Born in the East End of London in 1922, Turner developed an interest in sports as a boy, training in table tennis, diving, football, boxing and gymnastics. As a flyweight Turner boxed in the semi-finals of the Amateur Boxing Association of England Championship before deciding to develop his interest in gymnastics. Aged 11 he won the South of England Boys Championship in 1933 before making his international debut aged 15 in 1938. On leaving school in 1939 he worked as a bank clerk, but during World War II he was conscripted into the Royal Artillery in 1941. He served in North Africa and Sicily and was twice wounded. 
On being selected to captain the British gymnastics team in the 1948 Summer Olympics, Turner and the rest of the team had little if any experience of competing at an international level, and were unofficially coached by Helmut Bantz, a recently released German prisoner of war who had stayed in England as an agricultural worker. Turner competed in the Men's Individual All-Around, the Men's Team All-Around, the Men's Floor Exercise, the Men's Horse Vault, the Men's Parallel Bars, the Men's Horizontal Bar, the Men's Rings, and the Men's Pommelled Horse. A lifelong friend was fellow competitor George Weedon.
Turner was also at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, competing in the Men's Individual All-Around, the Men's Team All-Around, the Men's Floor Exercise, the Men's Horse Vault, the Men's Parallel Bars, the Men's Horizontal Bar, the Men's Rings, and Men's Pommelled Horse. 
In the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne Turner competed in the Men's Individual All-Around, the Men's Floor Exercise, the Men's Horse Vault,the Men's Parallel Bars, the Men's Horizontal Bar, the Men's Rings, and the Men's Pommelled Horse. As National Coach to the British gymnastics team he also attended the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.
Turner was four times British all-around gymnastics champion, from 1949 to 1951, and again in 1953. He also took part in the 1950 World Championships in Basle, and the 1954 European Championships in Frankfurt. He achieved his International Judges Brevet award in 1963 and was awarded his ‘Master Gymnast’ in 1974. In 1964 he took a BA degree in Sports Science at the Royal Polytechnic and a BEd from the Open University before becoming a lecturer at Watford College of Technology and Dulwich College. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 1965. He was also a Freemason. He doubled for actors including Michael Bentine and Norman Wisdom when gymnastic stunts were required in films and television dramas.
He received the Honorary Award of 'Distinguished Judge' from British Gymnastics. With his wife he had two sons, Keith and Colin Turner.
Frank Turner died of cancer at his home in Bricket Wood in Hertfordshire in September 2010 aged 87. His ashes were scattered in a field in Aldenham.

Mickeln House

Mickeln House () is a manor house in Düsseldorf's Himmelgeist neighbourhood.
It was erected in 1843 on the site of "Haus Mickeln", which went back to 1210. As that building was destroyed in a fire in 1836, Herzog Ludwig von Arenberg used an insurance payment to have renowned architect, Josef Niehaus, rebuild the manor as a summer residence. Niehaus used engravings of villas built in the 16th century by Galeazzo Alessi as a template.
The manor has a square plan, each side measuring 19.55 metres. All perspectives are designed identically, apart from an outside staircase on the northern side. The entrance portal is surrounded by lime trees. That concept was already envisaged in 1843, when the surrounding gardens were designed by Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe. Some of the trees have survived, e.g. plane trees, European Beech and two Lebanon cedars; the last-named are considered one of Düsseldorf's natural monuments.
Since June 2000, the estate has been used as a conference centre and guest house by Düsseldorf University.

Arromanches Camp is a military installation operated by the Royal Marines in North Devon located south west of Barnstaple, Devon, and north east of Bideford, Devon, England.
The name comes from the name of the town on Gold Beach of the Normandy landings from the Second World War. The village of Instow is twinned with Arromanches as is currently used by 11 (Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron, 1 Assault Group Royal Marines 
The camp is administered by the RMB Chivenor Base Support Regiment that provides messing and support facilities from Royal Marines Base Chivenor even though the squadron is part of 1 Assault Group Royal Marines from RM Poole.
11 Amphibious Trials and Training Unit Royal Marines.
With its unique geographical features, Instow offers the ability to train in extreme conditions of sea and surf. Therefore, Landing craft are based at 11(Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron to support this particular aspect of Landing Craft and Driver training. The beach conditions and vehicle access also make Instow the ideal location to train Amphibious Beach Unit (ABU) personnel in beach reconnaissance, beach trafficability and recovery operations. 
There site is split into two different sites, firstly the main site where the Dip Pit, workshops and accommodation is located and a second located south west which is where the main landing crafts are based.
The Beach Recovery Vehicle (BRV) is a British military support vehicle used for amphibious landings. Currently four are in UK service. Two based at ATTURM and one each on HMS "Albion" and HMS "Bulwark". 
Using the facilities and beaches around Instow, Landing Craft coxswains are trained to negotiate the most demanding beach conditions, especially through surf onto a shallow gradient beach. Drivers are taught to embark and disembark from Landing Craft, wading across a water gap of up to 1.5m (4 ft 6 inches) in depth, an activity known as fording. In addition drivers and vehicle mechanics are taught to waterproof their own vehicles. Trials of new vehicle types or vehicle waterproofing kits take place at 11(ATT) Squadron using Landing Craft when required.
The Royal Marines still have four DUKW vehicles remaining in service from World War II. They are used for training purposes at 11 (Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron RM.
The site is available for filming.

NXP LPC

LPC is a family of 32-bit microcontroller integrated circuits by NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semiconductors). The LPC chips are grouped into related series that are based around the same 32-bit ARM processor core, such as the Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M0+, or Cortex-M0. Internally, each microcontroller consists of the processor core, static RAM memory, flash memory, debugging interface, and various peripherals. The legacy LPC families were based on the 8-bit 80C51 core. As of February 2011, NXP had shipped over one billion ARM processor-based chips.
Overview.
All recent LPC families are based on ARM cores, which NXP Semiconductors licenses from ARM Holdings, then adds their own peripherals before converting the design into a silicon die. NXP is the only vendor shipping an ARM Cortex-M core in a DIP package: LPC810 in DIP8 (0.3-inch width) and LPC1114 in DIP28 (0.6-inch width). The following tables summarize the NXP LPC microcontroller families.
LPC4000 series.
The LPC4xxx series are based on the ARM Cortex-M4F core.
LPC4300.
The LPC4300 series have two ARM cores, one ARM Cortex-M4F and one ARM Cortex-M0. The LPC4350 chips are pin-compatible with the LPC1850 chips. The LPC4330-Xplorer development board is available from NXP. The summary for this series is:
LPC4000.
The LPC4000 series are based on the single ARM Cortex-M4F processor core. The LPC408x chips are pin-compatible with the LPC178x chips. The summary for this series is:

LPC.
All LPC microcontrollers have a ROM'ed bootloader that supports loading a binary image into its flash memory using one or more peripherals (varies by family). Since all LPC bootloaders support loading from the UART peripheral and most boards connect a UART to RS-232 or a USB-to-UART adapter IC, thus it's a universal method to program the LPC microcontrollers. Some microcontrollers requires the target board to have a way to enable/disable booting from the ROM'ed bootloader (i.e. jumper / switch / button).
Documentation.
The amount of documentation for all ARM chips is daunting, especially for newcomers. The documentation for microcontrollers from past decades would easily be inclusive in a single document, but as chips have evolved so has the documentation grown. The total documentation is especially hard to grasp for all ARM chips since it consists of documents from the IC manufacturer (NXP Semiconductors) and documents from CPU core vendor (ARM Holdings).
A typical top-down documentation tree is: manufacturer website, manufacturer marketing slides, manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip, manufacturer detailed reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family, ARM core generic user guide, ARM core technical reference manual, ARM architecture reference manual that describes the instruction set(s).
NXP has additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more. See External Links section for links to official NXP and ARM documents.

Grintovec, Kočevje

Grintovec (; also "Grintovec pri Kočevju"; or "Grintowitz bei Altlack"; Gottscheerish: "Grintəbitz") is a remote abandoned settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia. The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. Its territory is now part of the village of Kleč.
Name.
The name "Grintovec" is shared with several other settlements (e.g., "Grintovec", "Grintovec pri Osilnici", etc.). The name is derived from the Slovene common noun "grintavec" 'snowy/rocky bare area', 'dolomite', a univerbation of the phrase "grintav (svet)" 'empty area, rough area'. Simonič also suggests that the name could be derived from the plant field scabious ("Knautia arvensis"), known as "grintavec" in Slovene and "Grindkraut" in German. The longer Slovene name "Grintovec pri Kočevju" means 'Grintovec near Kočevje'. The longer German name "Grintowitz bei Altlack" means 'Grintovec near Stari Log'.
History.
Grintovec was a Gottschee German village. In the land registry of 1574 it had two full farms divided into four half-farms, corresponding to a population between 10 and 15. In the 1770 census the settlement had seven houses. Before the Second World War the settlement had nine houses and a population of 46. Italian troops burned the area on 1 August 1942 during the Rog Offensive. After this the Executive Committee of the Liberation Front (IOOF) established a hut in the vicinity for an economics committee.

Burying the Hatchet ceremony (Nova Scotia)

The Burying the Hatchet Ceremony (also known as the Governor's Farm Ceremony) happened in Nova Scotia on June 25, 1761 and successfully ended a period of protracted warfare, which had lasted over seventy-five years and encompassed six wars, between the Mi'kmaq people and the British (See the four French and Indian Wars, Father Rale's War and Father Le Loutre’s War). The Burying the hatchet Ceremony was the culmination of a negotiated treaty that created an enduring peace and a commitment to obey the rule of law.
Despite the intentions of the British dignitaries who attended the ceremony and helped draft the treaty, many of the Treaty commitments were ignored by local settlers who migrated onto Mi’kmaq and Maliseet territories. Fifteen years after the ceremony, some warfare returned as Maliseet and Mikmaq communities joined Americans against the British in the American Revolution.
Since the treaties were enshrined into the Canadian Constitution in 1982, there have been numerous judicial decisions that have upheld these treaties in the Supreme Court, the most recognized being the Donald Marshall case. Nova Scotians celebrate the Treaties of 1760-61 every year on Treaty Day (October 1).
Historical context.
The northeastern region of North American, encompassing New England and Acadia/Mi'kma'ki, increasingly became an area of conflict between the expanding French and British Empires. Expansion by both Empires, over a seventy-five-year period, through six wars brought the Mi’kmaq and Acadians into conflict with British New Englanders.
Frontier warfare against families was the Wabanaki Confederacy and New England approach to warfare since King William's War began in 1688. Over this seventy-five years, there was a long history of the Wabanaki Confederacy (which included the Mi'kmaq) killing British civilians along the New England/ Acadia border in Maine (See the Northeast Coast Campaigns 1688, 1703, 1723, 1724, 1745, 1746, 1747).
In an effort to prevent these French and Wabanaki massacres of British subjects, many Massachusetts Governors, issued a bounty for the scalps of men, women, and children of the Wabanaki Confederacy.
During Father Le Loutre’s War, Edward Cornwallis followed New England's example when, after the Raid on Dartmouth (1749), he attempted to protect the first British settlers in Nova Scotia from being scalped by putting a bounty on the Mi'kmaq (1749).
During the final period of this conflict, the French and Indian War, French Officers, Mi’kmaq and Acadians carried out military strikes against the British, particularly after the deportation of the Acadians and the bounty proclamation of 1756. The Mi'kmaq and their French allies conducted the Northeastern Coast Campaign (1755) in Maine and extended this campaign into Nova Scotia, attacking civilians during the raids on Lunenburg. Following the British capture of Louisbourg in 1758, Quebec in 1759, and Montreal in 1760, French imperial power was destroyed in North America. With the loss of their French ally the Mi’kmaq recognized the need for a new relationship with the British.
There were various treaties signed with other tribes of the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet before the formal burying the hatchet ceremony. On 11 February 1760, two tribes of the Passamaquoddy and St. John River came to Halifax with Colonel Arbuthnot and appeared before council, renewing the treaty of 1725, giving hostages or their good behavior. Truck houses for trade were established at Fort Frederick. Two days later, on Feb 13, a treaty was ratified with Roger Morris and one of the Mi'kmaq chiefs. The following month, 10 March 1760. Three Mi’kmaq chiefs Paul Laret, (LaHave); Michael Austine (Richibucto); Calude Renie (Cheboudie and Musquodoboit) made a treaty. The treaties continued even after the formal ceremony: on 15 October 1761, Jannesvil Peitougashwas (Pictock and Malogomish) made a treaty.
Former ally of Father Le Loutre, French priest Pierre Maillard accepted an invitation from Nova Scotia Governor Charles Lawrence to travel to Halifax and assist in negotiating with the Mi'kmaq peoples. He became a British official ("Government Agent to the Indians", with an annual salary of £150). He asked for (and received) permission to maintain an oratory at a Halifax battery, where he held Catholic services for Acadians and Mi'kmaqs in the area. In his official capacity Maillard was able to obtain agreement from most of the tribal chiefs to sign peace treaties with the British in Halifax.
The Ceremony.
On June 25, 1761, a “Burying of the Hatchet Ceremony” was held at Governor Jonathan Belcher’s garden on present-day Spring Garden, Halifax in front of the Court House.
Representing the colony were Belcher and four members of the Nova Scotia Council: Richard Bulkeley, John Collier, Joseph Gerrish, and Alexander Grant. Also present were Admiral Lord Colville, commander-in-chief of British naval forces in North America, Major-General John Henry Bastide, the chief engineer in Nova Scotia and Colonel William Forster, the commander of Nova Scotia’s army regiments. These three men were accompanied by a detachment of soldiers.
There were at least four Mi’kmaq chiefs that signed the treaty: Jeannot Peguidalonet (representing Cape Breton), Claude Atouach (Shediac), Joseph Sabecholouet (Miramichi), and Aikon Ashabuc (Pokemouche). Representatives from other villages were also present at the treaty signing.
The occasion was one of “great pomp and ceremony". The two parties faced each other near a British flag. French priest Pierre Maillard was in the middle acting as the interpreter. Belcher promised the crown would protect the Mi'kmaq from unscrupulous traders, protect their religion and not interfere with Catholic missionaries living among them. Belcher gave presents to each chief along with medals that were passed down through generations as testimony to the words that bound their people to uphold the peace. Both Belcher and the chiefs then moved to the flag post, where Belcher and the chiefs formally buried the hatchet.
One of the Mi'kmaq Chiefs declared that “he now buried the hatchet on behalf of himself and his whole tribe, a token of their submission and of their having made peace." The Chief of the Cape Breton Mi'kmaq’s declared: “As long as the Sun and the Moon shall endure, as long as the Earth on which I dwell shall exist in the same State as you this day, with the Laws of your Government, faithful and obedient to the Crown”.
At the same time the hatchet was being buried, the Chiefs went through the ceremony of washing the paint from their bodies in token of hostilities being ended. The whole ceremony was concluded by all present drinking to the king’s health. The cornerstone of the Halifax Provincial Court (Spring Garden Road) now stands beside the spot of the burial, a symbol of peace and the rule of law.
Aftermath.
The British were relieved that a peace was reached. The vicar at St. Paul's Church, Thomas Wood, praised Father Maillard for his efforts in negotiating it when he wrote, “Thanks to many Englishmen were saved from being massacred.” The Mi’kmaq retained a strong sense of themselves as a separate people. They still had their own language, a distinct material culture, trial institutions, and a spiritual life informed by Mi’kmaq tradition and an ongoing attachment to the Catholic Church, despite British attempts to converted them to Protestantism in the 1750s. The disrespect they often received from British colonists only served to emphasize their status as a separate nation.
According to historian John G. Reid, the treaties of 1760-61, while they contain statement of Mi'kmaw submission to the British crown, what is known of the surrounding discussions, combined with the strong evidence of later Mi'kmaw statements, indicates that a friendly and reciprocal relationship was the real intent. The Mi'kmaw leaders who came initially to Halifax in 1760 had clear goals that centred on the making of peace, the establishment of a secure and well-regulated trade in commodities such as furs, and an ongoing friendship with the British crown. In return, they offered their own friendship and a tolerance of limited British settlement, although without any formal land surrender. To fulfill the friendly and reciprocal intent of the treaties, further British settlement of land would need to be negogiated and, in exchange for sharing the land, presents would be given to the Mi'kmaq. The documents summarizing the peace agreements failed to establish specific territorial limits on the expansion of British settlements, but they assured the Mi’kmaq access to the natural resources that had long sustained them along the regions’ coasts and in the woods.
As the New England Planters and United Empire Loyalists began to arrive in the Mi'kmaki in greater numbers, economic, environmental and cultural pressures were put in the Mi'kmaq with the erosion of the intent of the treaties. The Mi'kmaq tried to enforce the treaties through threat of force. At the beginning of the American Revolution, many Mi’kmaq and Maliseet tribes were supportive of the Americans against the British. They participated in the Maugerville Rebellion and the Battle of Fort Cumberland in 1776. (Mí'kmaq delegates concluded the first international treaty, the Treaty of Watertown, with the United States soon after it declared its independence in July 1776. These delegates did not officially represent the Mi'kmaq government, although many individual Mi'kmaq did privately join the Continental army as a result.) During the St. John River expedition, Col. Allan's untiring effort to gain the friendship and support of the Maliseet and Mi'kmaq for the Revolution was somewhat successful. There was a significant exodus of Maliseet from the St John River to join the American forces at Machias, Maine. On Sunday, July 13, 1777, a party of between 400 and 500 men, women, and children, embarked in 128 canoes from the Old Fort Meduetic (8 miles below Woodstock) for Machias. The party arrived at a very opportune moment for the Americans, and afforded material assistance in the defence of that post during the attack made by Sir George Collier on the 13th to 15 August. The British did only minimal damage to the place, and the services of the Indians on the occasion earned for them the thanks of the council of Massachusetts. In June 1779, Mi’kmaq in the Miramichi attacked and plundered some of the British in the area. The following month, British Captain John Augustus Hervey, in command of HMS "Viper", arrived in the area and battled with the Mi’kmaq. One Mi’kmaq was killed and 16 were taken prisoner to Quebec. The prisoners were eventually brought to Halifax, where they were later released upon signing the Oath of Allegiance to the British Crown on 28 July 1779.
As their military power waned in the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Mi'kmaq people made explicit appeals to the British of the reciprocal intent of the treaties and the duty of the British to give "presents" (i.e. "rent") to the Mi'kmaq for occupying Mi'kma'ki. In response, the British offered charity or, the word most often used by government officials, "relief". And relief always came with strings attached. The Mi'kmaq must give up their way of life and begin to settle on farms. Their children were to be sent for a proper education to British schools.

The Sabertooth Vampire

The Sabertooth Vampire is a fictional character created by Mike Russell (author), an artist/writer who lives in Portland, Oregon. The character first appeared on Russell's Twitter feed as a sketch and has gone on to be included in a series of webcomics, two published compilations and several issues of "Dark Horse Presents".
Publication history and origins.
Russell, who writes regular movie reviews for "The Oregonian", a daily newspaper in Portland, created the Sabertooth Vampire in January 2011 while waiting for a preview screening of the "The Mechanic" to begin. He drew a sketch of a pint-sized vampire with oversized teeth and a Napoleon complex. He later posted the image on his Twitter feed with the caption "My attempt to find a new angle for the young-adult vampire-fiction market." Dylan Meconis, a Portland-based illustrator, encouraged Russell to further develop the character. This, coupled with a favorable response from Russell's readers, led him to create a series of black and white webcomics that were later assembled into two print collections.
The series has, thus far, been released in periodic "seasons" ala a television program. The first season was compiled in a collection and released in early 2011. A follow-up, titled "The Sabertooth Vampire: Unleashed," appeared that October and included comics from season two of the series. Russell announced a third season, tentatively scheduled for early 2013, at an event in Portland in December 2012.
During the spring and summer of 2012, issues 12, 14 and 15 of "Dark Horse Presents" included "Sabertooth Vampire" comic strips, one of which featured an encounter between the titular character and Hellboy, the popular comic book hero. The strips marked the first appearance of the character in color, compliments of Portland cartoonist Bill Mudron.
Fictional character biography.
The true origins of the Sabertooth Vampire are unknown but the series offers two theories. In one strip, the character evolves from a sabertooth caveman and becomes the Sabertooth Vampire after touching the mysterious monolith featured in the opening scene of "." In another strip titled "Secret Origins of the Sabertooth Vampire,' he's portrayed as the son of two modern-day vampires. His father is presented as a normal vampire with conventional fangs but his mother possesses much longer ones ala a sabertooth tiger, which the character was also born with. Like more prototypical vampires, the Sabertooth Vampire requires human blood to survive, appears invisible in mirrors and can turn into a bat but he remains impervious to sunlight and ages much like a human being. His childhood was fraught with traumatic experiences, which included awkward attempts at courtship, high school sports and theatrical productions as revealed in "I Was a Teenaged Sabertooth Vampire."
Over the course of the series, the Sabertooth Vampire routinely finds himself heavily burdened by his short stature and the weight of his long, cumbersome fangs. Nevertheless, this hasn't prevented him from embarking on a series of misadventures that have included trips into outer space, failed attempts at romance, car chases, roller derbies and a starring role in a commercial for a cereal called "Saber O's." He is often aided and rescued from various predicaments by Renfield, the character from Bram Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula". 
The strip's second season concludes with a cliffhanger after the Sabertooth Vampire uses a spray called "Vamp Away" to turn into a human after becoming frustrated with his long fangs and inability to shave with a mirror. His transformation renders him a mortal but, unfortunately, one with humongous incisors. Unsatisfied with his new form, in the strip's final panel he begs a group of disdainful vampires to turn him back into a member of the undead.
In issue # 14 of "Dark Horse Presents," the Sabertooth Vampire encountered Hellboy, the popular comic book hero, in a strip titled "Hellboy vs. the Sabertooth Vampire." Their conflict ended in a draw after the vampire's fangs became perpetually stuck in Hellboy's stone hand.
