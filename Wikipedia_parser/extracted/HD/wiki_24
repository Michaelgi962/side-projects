United States Department of State Operations Center

The United States Department of State’s Operations Center monitors world events, prepares written briefs for the Secretary of State and other State Department senior officials, and facilitates communication between the State Department and the rest of the world. 
Mission and activities.
As part of the Executive Secretariat, located in State Department’s headquarters in Washington DC, the Operations Center provides senior policy makers with alerts and briefings on world events affecting U.S. interests abroad. The organization's mission is to get the right information to the right people at the right time. To do so, the Operations Center is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. In addition to day-to-day operations, when a crisis arises, the Operations Center may set up a task force to address logistics and, in conjunction with the Consular Affairs bureau, assists U.S. citizens in need. In response to the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, as with many other crises, the Operations Center convened a task force to assist in coordinating humanitarian response, informing domestic and foreign officials, and aiding American citizens.
History and activities.
The Operations Center was inaugurated in 1961 at the instruction of President Kennedy. When the President could not reach anyone at State in the midst of a political crisis, he realized the importance of maintaining a crisis response center. At its inception, only one watch officer manned the Operations Center supplied with a GI-issue bunk bed, a water pitcher, and a telephone. Since then, the Operations Center has grown with the needs of the Secretary of State and the expanding U.S. diplomatic presence around the world. The Operations Center is made up of two parts: The Watch and Crisis Management Support.
The Watch
The Operations Center handles approximately 340,000 calls annually. It is manned by Watchstanders who work in shifts to provide coverage around the clock. At any moment, one of the State Department’s top leaders might call in requesting information on breaking news stories. These incoming calls overlap with the near constant intake of press and cable traffic. Watchstanders receive and process this information as a team. As Watchstanders receive information, they assess its importance and reach out to embassies and consulates overseas, as well as country desk officers at headquarters, to contextualize the information. The most relevant items are shared with senior officials through daily written and oral briefs. 
Crisis Management Support
Officers in Crisis Management Support (CMS) analyze information with an eye towards anticipating future hot spots around the world. By preparing for crises before they arise, CMS helps embassies and consulates abroad adjust their security protocols for any natural disaster or potential source of conflict. When a crisis does happen, CMS oversees tasks forces, managing coordination within the State Department and between interagency actors. 
In the Media: Reflecting on 50 Years of Service.
The Operations Center recently celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton marked this occasion by sharing some of her memorable interactions with the Operations Center. In one instance, she called asking to speak with an ambassador visiting Washington. A few minutes later, a Watch Officer connected her. Only later did she learn that the Ambassador did not have his cell phone with him. The Operations Center officers had called the Ambassador’s temporary residence and learned that the concierge had recommended three restaurants, but did not know which one he had chosen. Within minutes, while Secretary Clinton remained on the line, the officers dialed the restaurants, circulated a picture of the Ambassador, and requested that the waitstaff scan the premise for his party. A Watch Officer connected the Secretary with the Ambassador so quickly she was not initially aware of the exhaustive search process. As Secretary Clinton stated later on, “That is perseverance!” 
Secretary Clinton also highlighted the office’s role in rescuing a downed American pilot in Libya, a story which illustrates the international reach of the Operation Center’s reputation. A Libyan man who had received an education grant from the U.S. government found the pilot and called the Operations Center. The Watch Officer then called the Department of Defense, who promptly arranged his rescue. These stories highlight how the Operations Center supports the State Department’s goal of serving American citizens and safeguarding U.S. interests abroad.

Bidzina Cholokashvili () (died c. 1660) is a Christian martyr canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church. His feast is celebrated on October 1. He was one of the leaders of Bakhtrioni Uprising(1659). During the 1630s he was a sakhltukhutsesi of Kingdom of Kakheti. In the battle between Teimuraz and Rostom he supported the former. In 1648 by order of Teimuraz he invaded Ertso in order to make Ertso-Tianeti subordinate to the King. After the uprising Shah summoned Bidzina as well as Shalva and Elizbar Eristavi, who later were forced to converse their religion, but none of them accepted. As a result, they were given to tribes whose members were slaughtered during the uprising. Bidzina was tortured and killed.

Julia Goldani Telles

Julia Goldani Telles (born 18 March 1995, Los Angeles), is an American-Brazilian actress and ballet dancer. She is best known for her role as Sasha Torres on the short lived ABC Family series, "Bunheads".
Personal life.
Telles was born in Rio de Janeiro where she lived with her Brazilian mother and Mexican-American father until she was five years old. It was also there that she was introduced to the world of ballet. When the family relocated to New York City, at age 6, Telles could only speak Portuguese and learned English after the family's move. Telles attends Professional Children's School in Manhattan.
She began dancing in Brazil at the age of 5 before training professionally at the School of American Ballet and Ballet Academy East. She appeared in numerous ballet performances including "Sleeping Beauty", "Nutcracker", "Don Quixote" and "Swan Lake". A groin injury at the age of 15 had an important role in her fast success. She was forced to stop practicing ballet for a year, and to avoid depression, she decided to take a drama course. Her agent felt "Bunheads" should have been one of her first auditions as he felt she would be comfortable with the dancing aspect of the show.
Career.
Telles' first role in television came in 2011 when she successfully auditioned for the part of Sasha Torres in ABC Family's "Bunheads". She did so having never had an acting job before and without head-shots or a résumé. The pilot episode was filmed in November 2011, before being picked up for a 10 episode series which began airing on the 11th June 2012.
As well as "Bunheads", Telles also appeared in the Nat & Alex Wolff music video for the song "Greatest Prize" in early 2012.
She also guest starred on Blue Bloods episode "The Bogeyman" which aired Jan 10, 2014

Bustamante Park

Bustamante Park is an urban park in Providencia, Santiago de Chile. It is built on the former site of Pirque railroad station and adjacent classification yard. The park is bounded by Providencia Avenue on the north, just south of Plaza Baquedano, and Marín Street on the south.
Bustamante Park features bike paths, exercise equipment, a literary café, skatepark, monument and water feature. In recent years a number of new cafés and restaurants have opened around the park. Bustamante Park has also become a popular location for outdoor entertainment, with the Providencia Theatre Festival held there annually. 
Line 5 of the Santiago Metro runs under the entire length of the park, stopping at Baquedano and Parque Bustamante metro stations. Valdivieso advertising sign is located on one of the buildings that line the park.
Origins and Development.
Both the park and the avenue bordering it to the east take their name from José Antonio Bustamante, who fought in the battles of Chacabuco and Maipú. 
In the 19th century, located in the area where the park now stands was an avenue running parallel to Vicuña Mackenna Avenue. This disappeared in 1894 to make way for a railway joining Santiago with Puente Alto, which was then otherwise isolated from the city, through Pirque railroad station (built facing Providencia Avenue between 1905 and 1911, today the location of Metro Baquedano).
In the early 1940s, the stretch of rail between Pirque railroad station and Ñuñoa railroad station was dismantled, with the Pirque railroad station demolished by 1943, leaving space for the park to take shape.
On December 27, 1947, at the northern end of the park towards Plaza Baquedano, the Monument to Manuel Rodríguez was installed. In May 2008 a two-storey "Café Literario" (literary café) was inaugurated complete with a café, small library and reading areas, as well as views over the park including a water feature. Some time later, a skatepark was opened between Avenida Rancagua and Avenida Francisco Bilbao.

Scio House Hospital

Scio House Hospital for Officers, Putney was a hospital catering for military officers in Putney, London.
History.
Scio House was the last villa on Portsmouth Road abutting the heath. It was built and owned by Eustratios Stephanos Ralli, a founder of the Baltic Exchange and a member of the most successful Greek émigré merchant families, the Ralli Brothers of the mid-19th century. Their firm employed more than 40,000 people. They were quick to seize new opportunities created by wars, political events, and the opening of new markets, such as corn, cotton, silk, opium and fruit. Scio House was named after the family's birthplace, the Greek city and island of Chios. Mary Ann Chadwell describes driving "with Mrs Peter Ralli's children to Putney to see the grounds of Mrs E. Ralli. Beautiful views over Wimbledon Common." The mansion eventually became a hospital and was known as Scio House Hospital for Officers, Putney and in 1919 a Colonel Hargreaves was residing in Scio. By 1926 it was known as the British Red Cross Hospital, where serviceman injured in World War I still remained. Former British governor to Singapore Sir John Fearns Nicoll died at Scio in 1981. In the mid-1980s the site was controversially redeveloped as Lynden Gate, a gated community of 70 neo-Georgian homes divided between two streets. Opposition to the planned demolition of Scio House was raised in the House of Lords in 1982 by Lord Jenkins. The lily-filled Scio pond remains to this day, south of the Lynden Gate development, near where the now disused portion of the old Portsmouth Road veers towards Roehampton Lane and the A3 junction.

Thorald Brendstrup

Thorald Brendstrup (25 May 1812, Sengeløse – 4 May 1883, Copenhagen) was one of Denmark's Golden Age painters. Although he is not particularly well known, he is credited above all with many well-proportioned landscapes.
Biography.
Brendstrup studied decorative painting at the Danish Academy and porcelain painting at the Royal Danish Porcelain factory where he worked until 1846. Thereafter he concentrated on landscape painting.
Brendstrup's earlier works clearly show the influence of Eckersberg and Købke. He later painted landscapes in a highly Romantic style reminiscent of P. C. Skovgaard's. Especially his Italian landscapes demonstrate his deep appreciation of his subjects. His works are always well composed and clearly proportioned with a good sense of relationship between the foreground and the background while the colouring is faithful to the local tones. His works are often of a highly aesthetic quality, true to the tradition of the Danish Golden Age. One of the reasons Brendstrup is not widely recognized in Denmark is that he spent long periods abroad, often in Portugal and Italy. Furthermore, some of the landscapes he painted in and around Napoli and the Italian town of Olevano were not acquired by museums in Denmark, and are now privately owned.
He exhibited regularly at Charlottenborg from 1835 to 1882, not only foreign landscapes but also Danish scenes, particularly from the north of Zealand.
In 2012 the first ever major exhibition on Brendstrup and his work was jointly organised by Fuglsang Art Museum and Ribe Art Museum, and a book issued on this occasion with the most updated research on the artist.

<doc id="36608508" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36608508" title="Port Carlisle railway station">
Port Carlisle railway station

Port Carlisle railway station was a railway station in Port Carlisle, Cumbria; the terminus on the Port Carlisle Railway, serving the village and old port and the steamer service to Liverpool that ran from here until 1856, when it was transferred to Silloth. Port Carlisle was two and a half miles away by train from Drumburgh and Glasson was one and a quarter miles away. The journey time to Drumburgh was nine minutes, although Glasson was a request stop.
History.
A port was built in 1819 at the hamlet of Fisher's Cross, later renamed Port Carlisle and four years later, in 1821, the eleven and a half mile long Carlisle Navigation Canal. was built to take goods to Carlisle. The canal was closed in 1853 and the canal basin at Carlisle and parts of the canal were filled in by the Port Carlisle Railway Company who constructed a railway that started passenger services commenced in 1854, discontinuing them two years later when the Carlisle & Silloth Bay Railway & Dock Company's (C&SBRDC) new railway to Silloth opened, utilising the Port Carlisle Branch as far as Drumburgh. A brief resurgence of business at Port Carisle had taken place upon the opening of the railway, taken away however by the new port at Silloth and the transfer of the steamer service to Liverpool.
As a cheap alternative to a horse-drawn service was provided in 1856 between Drumburgh and Port Carlisle for a number of years. In 1914 steam power was used and to try and avoid closure a steam railmotor called 'Flower of Yarrow' was built and this service to Port Carlisle railway station lasted until the branch was closed in 1932. Freight services had been withdrawn in 1899.
By altering sediment-carrying currents the construction of Solway railway viaduct of the Solway Junction Railway caused Port Carlisle harbour to silt up and lose trade, which in turn eventually resulted in the abandonment of the Port Carlisle to Carlisle railway. A large jetty further up the Solway had also threw the River Eden off towards the Scottish side and further hindered access to the port.
The Port Carlisle Railway Company had agreed to supply a locomotive if the C&SBRDC provided rolling stock. The North British Railway leased the line from 1862, it was absorbed by them in 1880, and then taken over by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923.
On the day of closure residents gathered in a bower on the bowling green and passed a motion that ""the line had been closed because of the poor and inadequate service offered to the public.""
Infrastructure.
The station had a substantial station house and a single platform intersected by a road crossing. A spur with sidings ran down towards the old canal jetty basin, a longer siding ran down to a second jetty and a turntable was located near the tumulus.
At Canal Junction the Port Carlisle line made an end on junction with the earlier goods branch from London Road and it was this section on to Drumburgh (pronounced drum-bruff) that was taken over by the Carlisle & Silloth Bay Railway & Dock Company. Immediately west of Drumburgh station the line branched off from the line to Silloth, passing under a minor road to Port Carlisle. The branch ran close to the south bank of the Solway Firth and the course of Hadrians Wall heading over low ground to the terminus of the line at Port Carlisle.
Micro-history.
The Brampton to Brampton Junction line was also worked by a horse-drawn carriage from circa 1838 to 1881 and was known as the 'dandy' line.
Until the 1980s the station platform was fully intact and open to view; it has since been infilled and is part of a car park.
The railway leading to Port Carlisle lay close to the course of Hadrians Wall for much of its course. 
Four horse-drawn 'Dandy cars' built by the North British Railway. The Dandy car was originally preserved at Carlisle, before being moved to the National Railway Museum at York. Port Carlisle became a day tourist attraction to Carlisle Victorians. Isaac Hickson was the driver of the horse-drawn train, and he became the guard on the steam powered train that entered service on 6 April 1914.
The 'Flower of Yarrow' Sentinel Railcar used on the line was driven by James Grey with T. Jackson as the fireman worked on the Port Carlisle Railway in 1932 before its final closure.

Kerr-McGee Corp. v. Navajo Tribe

Kerr-McGee v. Navajo Tribe, 471 U.S. 195 (1985), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that an Indian tribe is not required to obtain the approval of the Secretary of the Interior in order to impose taxes on non-tribal persons or entities doing business on a reservation.
Background.
History.
The Navajo Tribe is an Indian (Native American) tribe with a reservation occupying parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico. In 1978, the tribal council passed two taxing ordinances. The first was a tax of 3% on leaseholds (such as mineral rights) and the second was a 5% tax on business activity. The tribe forwarded the ordinances to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior for approval. The BIA informed the tribe that there was no law that required federal approval for a tribal tax.
Lower courts.
Kerr-McGee held substantial mineral rights in the reservation and filed a lawsuit in the federal district court seeking an injunction to prohibit the tribe from collecting the tax. Kerr-McGee argued that any tax of non-Indians by a tribe required approval by the Secretary of the Interior and the district court agreed, granting the injunction. The tribe appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit overruled the district court, finding no federal statute or regulation required such approval. Kerr-McGee then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari and agreed to hear the case.
Opinion of the court.
Arguments.
Alvin H. Shrago argued the case for Kerr-McGee. Elizabeth Bernstein argued the case for the tribe. The United States argued the case on behalf of the tribe. "Amicus curiae" briefs were filed in support of Kerr-McGee by the Arizona Public Service Co., the Peabody Coal Co., the Phillips Petroleum Co., the Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District and Texaco, Inc.. "Amicus curiae" briefs were filed in support of the tribe by Association on American Indian Affairs and for the Shoshone Indian Tribe Reservation.
Kerr-McGee argued that the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) required the Secretary of the Interior to approve any tribal taxes on non-Indians. They also argued that the Indian Mineral Leasing Act (IMLA) required BIA approval for taxes.
Unanimous opinion.
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger delivered the unanimous opinion of the court. Burger noted that the IRA only required BIA approval of tribal constitutions and bylaws, not the power to tax. He noted that it would not affect the Navajo tribe in any case, since the tribe declined to accept the provisions of the IRA. Burger also took note that the tribal authority to tax had been recognized long before the IRA was enacted. The IMLA also did not require approval for taxes, merely requiring that the Secretary issue regulations on oil and gas leases, which he has done. The regulations do not require his approval for taxes by tribes.
Burger noted that the policy of the federal government was to promote tribal self-government, and the power to tax is an inherent power of government. When a tribe executes a mineral rights lease it is acting in a commercial matter, and that does not prevent the tribe from exercising tribal sovereignty in enacting a tax. Since there is not a federal law prohibiting such a tax, the tribe is within its rights to enact one. The judgment of the Ninth Circuit was affirmed.
Subsequent developments.
"Kerr-McGee" is one of a series of cases where the Supreme Court has ruled, based on tribal sovereignty, that tribes have the right to tax non-Indians. These cases led to tribes renegotiating inequitable mineral leases, forming their own natural resources regulatory agencies, and tribal development companies. In the case of the Navajo tribe, which had a long history of uranium mining and radioactive contamination of both tribal members and its water sources by mining firms (including ironically, Kerr-McGee), it supported the outright ban on uranium mining. It has been used to support the right of tribes to control their natural resources, including exercising civil jurisdiction over non-Indians. In recognition of the importance of the decision to the tribe, the tribal council declared that the date of the decision was a tribal holiday, known as "Navajo National Sovereignty Day."

From 1517 Lax was again at the Collège de Calvi. In Paris he was known as the "Prince of Sophists". He taught in Paris until 1523 and then returned to Spain because in that year all foreigners were requested to leave the Parisian universities. Starting in 1525 he taught mathematics and philosophy at the University of Saragossa and remained there until his death.

List of superlative trees

The world's superlative trees can be ranked by height, trunk diameter or girth, total size and age.
Tallest.
The heights of the tallest trees in the world have been the subject of considerable dispute and much exaggeration. Modern verified measurements with laser rangefinders, or with tape drop measurements made by tree climbers (such as those carried out by canopy researchers), have shown that some older measuring methods and measurements are often unreliable, sometimes producing exaggerations of 5% to 15% or more above the real height. Historical claims of trees growing to , and even , are now largely disregarded as unreliable, and attributed to human error. Historical records of fallen trees measured prostrate on the ground are considered to be somewhat more reliable. Historically, the tallest individual is claimed to be the Ferguson Tree, at 132.6 metres (435 ft), a Eucalyptus regnans found in the Watts River region of Victoria, Australia in 1871 or 1872. This record is often disputed as unreliable, despite first-hand documentary evidence of it being measured on the ground with surveyor's tape by a senior forestry official. 
The following are now accepted as the top nine tallest reliably measured species (taking only currently standing specimens):
Stoutest.
The girth of a tree is usually much easier to measure than the height, as it is a simple matter of stretching a tape round the trunk, and pulling it taut to find the circumference. Despite this, UK tree author Alan Mitchell made the following comment about measurements of yew trees:
As a general standard, tree girth is taken at "breast height". This is converted to and cited as dbh (diameter at breast height) in tree and forestry literature. Breast height is defined differently in different situations, with most forestry measurements taking girth at 1.3 m above ground, while those who measure ornamental trees usually measure at 1.5 m above ground; in most cases this makes little difference to the measured girth. On sloping ground, the "above ground" reference point is usually taken as the highest point on the ground touching the trunk, but in North America a point, that is the average of the highest point and the lowest point the tree trunk appears to contact the soil, is usually used. Some of the inflated old measurements may have been taken at ground level. Some past exaggerated measurements also result from measuring the complete next-to-bark measurement, pushing the tape in and out over every crevice and buttress.
Modern trends are to cite the tree's diameter rather than the circumference. The diameter of the tree is calculated by finding the mean diameter of the trunk, in most cases obtained by dividing the measured circumference by π; this assumes the trunk is mostly circular in cross-section (an oval or irregular cross-section would result in a mean diameter slightly greater than the assumed circle). Accurately measuring circumference or diameter is difficult in species with the large buttresses that are characteristic of many species of rainforest trees. Simple measurement of circumference of such trees can be misleading when the circumference includes much empty space between buttresses. See also Tree girth measurement
Baobabs (genus "Adansonia") store large amounts of water in the very soft wood in their trunks. This leads to marked variation in their girth over the year (though not more than about 2.5%), reaching maximum at the end of the rainy season, and minimum at the end of the dry season.
The stoutest living single-trunk species in diameter are:
Measurements become ambiguous when multiple trunks (whether from an individual tree or multiple trees) grow together.
The Sacred Fig grows adventitious roots from its branches, which become new trunks when the root reaches the ground and thickens; a single sacred fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks. The multi-stemmed Hundred Horse Chestnut was known to have a circumference of when it was measured in 1780.
Largest by volume.
The largest trees in total volume are both tall and large in diameter and, in particular, hold a large diameter high up the trunk. Measurement is very complex, particularly if branch volume is to be included as well as the trunk volume, so measurements have only been made for a small number of trees, and generally only for the trunk. No attempt has ever been made to include root volume. Standards of tree volume measurement vary.
The top eleven species measured so far are*:
(*)This list does not take into account specimens no longer living.
Oldest.
The oldest trees are determined by growth rings, which can be seen if the tree is cut down, or in cores taken from the bark to the center of the tree. Accurate determination is only possible for trees that produce growth rings, generally those in seasonal climates. Trees in uniform non-seasonal tropical climates grow continuously and do not have distinct growth rings. It is also only possible for trees that are solid to the center. Many very old trees become hollow as the dead heartwood decays. For some of these species, age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates, but the results are usually largely speculation. White (1998) proposes a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the United Kingdom through the correlation of a tree's age with its diameter and growth character.
The verified oldest measured ages are:
Other species suspected of reaching exceptional age include European Yew ("Taxus baccata") (probably over 2,000 years), Sugi ("Cryptomeria japonica") (3,000 years or more), and Western Redcedar ("Thuja plicata"). The oldest known European Yew is the Llangernyw Yew in the Churchyard of Llangernyw village in North Wales, which is estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,000 years old. The Fortingall Yew is said to be one of the oldest known trees in Europe.
The olive tree also can live for centuries. The oldest verified age is 900 years at Gethsemane (Mount of Olives, as mentioned in the Bible), while several other olive trees are suspected of being 2,000 to 3,000 years old, over 3,000 years for Vouves, or even 6,000 years old for The Sisters.

Veasey is currently the United States Representative for Texas's 33rd congressional district, winning the office in November 2012. Previously he was a member of the Texas House of Representatives from 2005 to 2013, where he served as Chair Pro Tempore of the House Democratic Caucus. He is a member of the Democratic Party.
Early life, education, and early career.
Veasey was born on January 3, 1971 to Connie and Joseph Veasey. With his parents and brother, Ryan, Veasey and his family lived in numerous rental houses in the Stop Six neighborhood of Fort Worth, Texas. When he was ten years old, his parents divorced, and Marc, Ryan and their mother moved in with their maternal grandmother in the Como neighborhood of Fort Worth.
Veasey attended Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth, Texas. He graduated from Texas Wesleyan University with a bachelor of science degree in mass communications.
Veasey worked as a substitute teacher and sportswriter, as well as writing scripts for an advertising agency. One summer, he volunteered for United States Representative Martin Frost, and was hired as a field representative. Veasey worked for Frost for five years.
Texas House of Representatives.
Elections.
As a result of the 2003 Texas redistricting, Frost lost his reelection effort in 2004 to Pete Sessions. In the 2004 elections, Veasey challenged Democratic State Representative Glenn Lewis for Texas's 95th House district. He defeated the incumbent 54%-46% in the Democratic primary. He won the general election unopposed. He was re-elected in 2006 (91%), 2008 (96%), and 2010 (100%).
Tenure.
Veasey represented Texas House District 95 from 2005 to 2013. He was the Chair Pro Tempore of the House Democratic Caucus. He has sponsored measures to create career and technology training in high schools. He authored HB 62 which honored Tim Cole, a Texas Tech University student wrongly convicted of raping a fellow student in 1985. Marc also authored a bill requiring a study to lead to greater enforcement of the James Byrd Jr. hate crime bill.
U.S. House of Representatives.
2012 election.
Veasey declared his candidacy for Texas's 33rd congressional district, a new congressional district for the United States House of Representatives that was created by reapportionment following the 2010 United States census. The district is based in Tarrant and Dallas counties. It is a heavily Democratic district: the Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) was D+14. The district is also highly diverse: 66% Hispanic and 17% African American. 
Eleven candidates filed to run in the Democratic primary. Veasey finished first, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the primary outright. He received 37% of the vote. State Representative Domingo García ranked second with 25% of the vote, qualifying for the run-off election. Veasey won Tarrant with 49% of the vote, while Garcia won Dallas with 44% of the vote. In the run-off primary election, Veasey defeated Garcia 53%-47%. He carried Tarrant with a whopping 68% of the vote. Garcia couldn't make up the difference in Dallas, in which he won overwhelmingly with 70% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Republican Chuck Bradley 73%-26%. He won Tarrant with 78% of the vote and Dallas with 66% of the vote. Veasey is the first African American representative elected from Tarrant County.
2014 election.
Veasey won re-nomination in the March 4 primary election by defeating Tom Sanchez, 13,285 votes (73.5 percent) to 4,797 (26.5 percent).
Personal life.
Veasey is married to Tonya Jackson, a former Texas Senate aide. The couple have a son, named Adam Clayton. Veasey's uncle, Robert James English, was a television reporter and worked for Jim Wright, the former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

Tree health

Trees live for a long time but eventually die, either from natural causes or killed by man. Arborists need to be aware of the risk posed and be able to identify hazardous trees. Construction projects sometimes damage trees.
Tree damage.
The two sources of tree damage are either biotic (from living sources) or abiotic (from non-living sources). Biotic sources include insects that bore into the tree, deer that rub bark off, and fungi.
Abiotic sources include lightning, vehicles impacts, and construction activities. Construction activities can involve a number of damage sources, including grade changes that prevent aeration to roots, spills involving toxic chemicals such as cement or petroleum products, or severing of branches or roots.
Both damage sources can result in trees becoming dangerous, and the term "hazard trees" is commonly used by arborists, and industry groups such as power line operators. Hazard trees are trees that, due to disease or other factors, are more susceptible to falling in windstorms, or having parts of the tree fall.
Risk assessment.
Evaluating the danger a tree presents is based on a process called the Quantified Tree Risk Assessment.
Assessment as to labeling a tree a hazard tree can be based on a field examination. Assessment as a result of construction activities that will damage a tree is based on three factors: severity, extent and duration. Severity relates usually to the degree of intrusion into the TPZ and resultant root loss. Extent is frequently a percentage of a factor such as canopy, roots or bark, and duration is normally based on time. Root severing is considered permanent in time.
One of the most common ways to assess a hazard within large trees, is examining the union between trunk and branch. 'V'-shaped unions may create weakness and increase failure risk; this can be reduced by tree cabling, which reduces how far the tree stem can swing in strong winds.
Trees can withstand large amounts of some types of damage and survive, but even small amounts of other traumas can result in death. Arborists are very aware that established trees will not tolerate any appreciable disturbance of the root system. However, lay people and construction professionals seldom recognise how easily a tree can be killed.
One reason for confusion about tree damage from construction involves the dormancy of trees during winter. Another factor is that trees may not show symptoms of damage until two years or longer after damage has occurred. For that reason, persons uneducated in arboricultural science may not correlate the actual cause and resultant effect.
Various organisations, such as the International Society of Arboriculture, the British Standards Institute and the Tree Industry Association (formerly the National Arborist Association), have long recognised the importance of construction activities that impact tree health. The impacts are important because they can result in monetary losses due to tree damage and resultant remediation or replacement costs, as well as violation of government ordinances or community or subdivision restrictions.
Protocols.
As a result, protocols for tree management prior to, during and after construction activities are well established, tested and refined. These basic steps are involved:

Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man

Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man (Italian title: " Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe") is a 1963 two-act play by Italian playwright Dario Fo, the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature. Some people got angry: Fo received threatening letters, was assaulted in Rome with Rame by Fascist groups who also threw rubbish at them, while another performance was disrupted by a bomb scare. He recounted this event in the prologue of "Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas".
Plot summary.
The play is considered "an attempt to demystify and debunk the traditional history-book image" of Christopher Columbus. Fo said: "I wanted to attack those Italian intellectuals who, with the centre-left and the Socialist Party in the government, had discovered power and its advantages and leapt on it like rats on a piece of cheese. I wanted to dismantle a character who had been embalmed as a hero in school history books, whereas he is in fact an intellectual who tries to keep afloat within the mechanisms of power, play games with the King and be cunning with power figures, only to end up reduced to a wretch."
"Isabella..." is a play-within-a-play wherein an actor condemned to death (for performing the works of a banned author) is granted a last wish to perform one last play. He performs a history of Christopher Columbus, of which Roberto Rebora, writing in "Sipario" in 1963, says:
The play about Columbus presents the Genovese hero as an obsessive, wily individual, pitting his wits against Isabella, Filippo, Giovanna the madwoman, the (Spanish) court, sailing ships, enemies, a trial, and eventual obscurity, a consequence of the fact that cunning and unscrupulousness (even to honourable ends) is not enough if the powers that be are not on your side.' 
Production history.
The play was first produced at the Teatro Odeon in Milan on 6 September 1963, in a production directed by Fo himself. It was later broadcast on RAI 2 in May 1977, and revived at the Centro Dramatico Nacional in Valencia, Spain in 1992 (again directed by Fo).

Bedale Hall

Bedale Hall is a Grade I listed Palladian-style country house in the town of Bedale, North Yorkshire, England.
The house is a large two-storey house constructed of brick and ashlar with a stone slate roof. It is situated in parkland at the north end of Bedale, off the Leyburn road.
History.
The estate in which Bedale Hall sits was purchased in 1638 by John Peirse from the descendants of Bryan FitzAlan, Lord of Bedale. A manor house, later incorporated into the present building, was built around the 17th century on the site.
Expansion of the building to create the current Palladian mansion was commenced in 1730 by Henry Peirse, primarily by infilling between the wings of the existing house. The hall then remained unchanged until about 1760, when a new wing was added to house a racing stud, together with gallops on nearby land. In 1777 the hall was again expanded by incorporating a nearby house into the structure.
In the early 19th century the estate was inherited by Henry William De La Poer Beresford from an aunt, after which he appended the surname of Peirse to his own. His son, Henry Monson De La Poer Beresford-Peirse (1850–1926) succeeded his uncle as third baronet Beresford-Peirse in February 1873. The family occupied the hall until after the First World War, when it was leased to tenants before being requisitioned for military use during the Second World War. After being handed back in 1948 the hall stood empty for a while and was invaded by a dozen squatter families who caused a considerable amount of damage to the fabric. 
In 1951 the building was purchased for 4000 pounds by Bedale Rural District Council, who demolished the stable wing as unsafe and made the main building fit for use as offices, which were occupied in 1952. The surrounding land was made into a public park. The Council then undertook a programme of improvement, the objective of which was the complete restoration of the Staircase Hall, Corridor and Saloon, (now called the Ballroom) with the help of a large grant from the Historic Buildings Council. The work was completed in 1961 and every detail of the Ballroom, except for the heaters and emergency exits, is now as it was originally completed in 1730. As well as providing office space the building was used for various community activities, which continued after it was taken over by the new Hambledon council in 1974.
The hall is now operated as a charitable trust.

<doc id="36608858" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36608858" title="Oculus Rift">
Oculus Rift

The Rift is an upcoming virtual reality head-mounted display, being developed by Oculus VR. During its period as an independent company, Oculus VR had raised US$91 million for the development of the Rift. The consumer version of the product is expected to become available in late 2014 or early 2015.
History.
Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, earned a reputation for having the largest personal collection of head-mounted displays in the world, and is a longtime moderator in Meant to be Seen (MTBS) 3D's discussion forums. Through MTBS' forums, Palmer developed the idea of creating a new head-mounted display that was both more effective than what is currently on the market, and inexpensive for gamers.
Coincidentally, John Carmack had been doing his own research and happened upon Palmer's developments. After sampling an early unit, Carmack favored Luckey's prototype and just before the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Id Software announced that their future updated version of "Doom 3", which would be known as "BFG Edition", would be compatible with head-mounted display units. During the convention, Carmack introduced a duct taped head-mounted display based on Palmer's Oculus Rift prototype, which ran Carmack's own software. The unit featured a high speed IMU and a LCD display, visible via dual lenses that were positioned over the eyes to provide a 90 degrees horizontal and 110 degrees vertical stereoscopic 3D perspective.
On March 25, 2014, Facebook announced that it had agreed to buy Oculus VR for $400 million in cash, $1.6 billion in Facebook stock, and an additional $300 million subject to Oculus VR's meeting certain financial targets in a transaction expected to close in the second quarter of 2014.
Developer version.
The Oculus developer kit was an initial version financed by a Kickstarter campaign, which sought to get the initial Oculus Rift into the hands of developers to begin integration of the device into their games. In August 2012, Oculus announced that the "dev kit" version of the Oculus Rift would be given as a reward to backers who pledged $300 or more on Kickstarter. There was also a limited run of 100 unassembled Rift prototype kits for pledges over $275 that would ship a month earlier.
Developer kit preorders were made available for $300 on their website starting on 26 September 2012. These kits sold at a rate of 4–5 per minute for the first day, before slowing down throughout the week. As of 12 March 2014, the Rift DK1 kit was no longer available to order from Oculus. In March 2014 at GDC, Oculus announced the upcoming Devkit 2 (DK2) which they expected to begin shipping in July 2014. A few weeks later they stated on their website that new orders was expected to be shipped in a second batch in August of the same year.
On March 19, 2014, Oculus VR announced the much anticipated second iteration of their development kit (DK2) and started taking pre-orders. It features several improvements over the first development kit, such as having a higher-resolution low-persistence OLED display, higher refresh rate, head positional tracking, a detachable cable, and the omission of the need for the external control box.
Consumer version.
A consumer-oriented version of the Rift is in development, which will be aimed at a general market and feature improved components. Improved head tracking, positional tracking, higher resolution, and wireless operation are some of the features under consideration for the consumer Rift.
In June 2013, a 1080p version of the Rift was shown at Electronic Entertainment Expo. At Consumer Electronics Show in January 2014, an updated prototype codenamed "Crystal Cove" was unveiled, which uses a special low-persistence of vision OLED display, and includes a new motion tracking system that uses an external camera which tracks infrared dots located on the headset. The new motion tracking system would allow the system to detect actions such as leaning or crouching, which should help alleviate sickness experienced by users when the software did not respond to these actions.
On April 30, 2014, Business Insider titled an article to assert that the consumer version of the Rift will be released in 2015, based on a partial quote attributed to "Management at Oculus VR." The quote in question indicates that the company would be "disappointed" if the headset is not released commercially before 2016. This article has been referenced by multiple other sources as official confirmation of a 2015 release date, but representatives of Oculus assert that no release date has yet been announced.
Hardware.
The first prototype of the device used a screen, but after the unexpectedly successful Kickstarter, Oculus determined that the panel was not available in sufficient quantities, so they changed their design to use a new screen, which makes the Rift developer kit somewhat bulkier than the first prototypes. 
The new panel's pixel switching time is significantly lower, reducing latency and motion blur when turning one's head quickly. The pixel fill is also better, reducing the screen door effect and making individual pixels less noticeable. The LCD is brighter and the color depth is 24 bits per pixel. The 7 inch screen also makes the stereoscopic 3D no longer 100% overlapping, the left eye seeing extra area to the left and the right eye seeing extra area to the right. This mimics normal human vision, which does not overlap 100% either, although the overlap area is smaller on the Rift than in real life. 
The field of view (FOV) is more than 90 degrees horizontal (110 degrees diagonal), which is more than double the FOV of most competing devices, and is the primary strength of the device. It is intended to almost fill the wearer's entire field of view, and the real world is completely blocked out, to create a strong sense of immersion. The resolution is 1280×800 (16:10 aspect ratio), which leads to an effective of 640×800 per eye (4:5 aspect ratio). However, since the Rift does not feature a 100% overlap between the eyes, the combined horizontal resolution is effectively greater than 640. The image for each eye is shown in the panel as a barrel distorted image that is then corrected by pincushion effect created by lenses in the headset, generating a spherical-mapped image for each eye. The panel's resolution is expected to be upgraded to at least 1920×1080 for the final consumer version. 
Initial prototypes used a Hillcrest Labs 3DoF head tracker that is normally 125 Hz, with a special firmware that John Carmack requested which makes it run at 250 Hz, tracker latency being vital due to the dependency of virtual reality's realism on response time. The latest version includes Oculus' new 1000 Hz Adjacent Reality Tracker that will allow for much lower latency tracking than almost any other tracker. It uses a combination of 3-axis gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers, which make it capable of absolute (relative to earth) head orientation tracking without drift.
The weight of the headset is approximately , which is an increase of about in weight due to the increased screen size, and it does not include headphones.
The headset has a dial on each side that can be turned with a screwdriver which allows adjusting each display to be moved closer or further away from the eyes. The development kit also includes interchangeable lenses that will allow for simple dioptric correction. Adjustment for the interpupillary distance is done in software, although given its large exit pupil, this should not be a severe issue with the Rift.
The developer version of the Rift has DVI and HDMI input on the control box, and comes with one HDMI cable, and a DVI to HDMI adapter. 
A USB interface is used for sending tracking data to the host machine. It also comes with a power adapter that must be used to connect the control box to a power outlet. 
Software.
Games and game platforms must be specifically designed to work correctly with the Oculus Rift. Oculus is producing a software development kit (SDK) to assist developers with integrating the Oculus Rift with their games. The SDK will include code, samples and documentation. According to Oculus, game integration will begin with PCs and smartphones, and be followed by consoles at a later date. Since its introduction, many developers have been working on integration.
Several titles are playable on the Rift via the free and open source Vireio Perception VR drivers. Games currently with full or partial support include "Left 4 Dead", "", "Portal 2", "Half Life 2", and "Bioshock".
Several commercial options are also available, including Vireio Perception 2.0, the VorpX commercial driver, and Dynamic Digital Depth's Oculus Rift "Add-On" VR for their TriDef Ignition stereoscopic 3D drivers.
In an effort to make sure claims of VR compatibility have an objective meaning, Meant to be Seen released GameGradeVR. The service is non-proprietary and works with DDD, Vireio Perception, VorpX, and native VR software that does not require a middleware add-on. Gamer driven, the service asks the user a series of questions about required game settings, visual flexibility, and any problems or anomalies that remain. The final score and entry tells users what they need to get the best results, and informs software developers what problems need solving without infringing on artistic choices.
Adoption.
"Team Fortress 2" was the first game to add support for the Oculus Rift, and is currently available to play with the Oculus Rift dev kit by use of a command line option. The second title to support the Oculus Rift was the Oculus-only version of "Museum of the Microstar" which was released in April 2013. "Half-Life 2" was the third, and "Hawken" is likely to be the fourth game to support the Rift; it was prominently featured in the Kickstarter, and Oculus used it to demo the Rift at the GDC. "Doom 3: BFG Edition" was originally going to be the first game to officially support the Oculus Rift, but after the change of tracker and the change to the 7-inch panel, Id Software has not yet updated the game to support it. 
"The Gallery: Six Elements" is the first announced game being designed specifically for the Oculus Rift and Virtual Reality, rather than adding Rift support to an existing game. This is considered important because many existing games use features that do not translate well to VR, such as a HUD, cutscenes, menus, third person sections, fast movement speeds, not being able to see one's own body, etc. It is currently on Kickstarter.
Epic Games, creators of the Unreal Engine, have announced that the engine will integrate support for the Oculus Rift. David Helgason, CEO of Unity Technologies, has announced support for the Oculus Rift with the Unity engine. John Carmack, formerly of id Software, had stated that he plans to make the Oculus Rift a concurrent part of the "Doom 4" development cycle to ensure that it works well with the game at launch.
"Star Citizen", an upcoming space role-playing simulator from Chris Roberts (creator of "Wing Commander" and "Freelancer") and "", a continuation of the "Elite" space trading and role playing game series from the 1980s and 1990s, are both being built with Oculus support ("Elite: Dangerous" Alpha releases have support already, as does the Hangar Module and upcoming Arena Commander dogfight module of "Star Citizen").
Several prominent figures from the games industry, notably John Carmack, the co-founder of Id Software, Gabe Newell, the co-founder of Valve Corporation, Michael Abrash, the author of "Zen of Graphics Programming" and "Graphics Programming Black Book", Cliff Bleszinski, former design director at Epic Games, and David Helgason, the founder of Unity 3D publicly endorsed the Rift. Michael Abrash, who was researching virtual reality and augmented reality at Valve said "I personally would like to get our games running on the Rift and make it a great experience". Notch, developer of "Minecraft", while initially stating that his games would likely support the Rift, announced soon after the company's acquisition by Facebook that he was canceling any such plans. However, a "Minecraft" mod by the name of "Minecrift" adds unofficial support for the Rift.
Broadcasting.
Demos of the Oculus Rift featuring impressions and gameplay with both single images and stereo images have been broadcast on YouTube by a number of popular video game content providers. A home video titled "My 90 year old grandmother tries the Oculus Rift" went viral with over 2 million views.
Related projects.
While working as a designer at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies, Palmer Luckey worked on the FOV2GO project: an inexpensive kit consisting of a simple housing and optics to allow someone to put together a cheap HMD using a mobile phone as the display device. The FOV2GO project is now available as a template allowing anyone to build the unit themselves.
A team from the University of Southern California is working on creating a fully immersive virtual reality experience called "Project Holodeck", which utilises Razer Hydra motion controllers, PS Move positional tracking, and the Oculus Rift HMDs to give the user the impression of being inside of a complete virtual world.
At the 2014 Game Developer's Conference, Sony announced Project Morpheus, and had prototype units on hand for demonstration. Like the Rift, the Morpheus is a head-mounted display designed for immersive virtual reality. The Morpheus is designed to work with the company's flagship video game console, the PlayStation 4. Like the Rift, it is not yet available to consumers. 
The first retail commercial use of the Oculus Rift was June 20, 2014 in Prague, Czech Republic, where small start-up FlyPrague installed a moving platform with six seats for sightseeing purposes. Each seat includes a Rift with RiftUp (full HD display upgrade by VR Union) . Passengers sit on the platform with the Rift display and fly through the historical Prague center. Flight is situated as an airline experience. It starts on Wenceslas Square and visits about five of the most important historical places in ten minutes.

Elizabeth Apartments

The Elizabeth Apartments on Second Ave. NW in Jamestown, North Dakota were built in 1921.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
According to its NRHP nomination,The Elizabeth Apartments is significant in Jamestown for its association with the business lives of the John H. Canhams and Ormsby McHargs, leading developers and owners of Jamestown's utility companies from 1888 to 1924. It is also significant architecturally and historically as the best example in the city of affordable multi-family housing constructed in response to the population boom in Jamestown between 1910 and 1920 when housing was scarce, Post-World War I labor costs were high, and there was a severe shortage of
building materials. The simplicity of the apartment building design and the extensive use of stucco were directly related to the need for quick construction and the lack of good building materials, including brick, in the early 1920s.

<doc id="36608912" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36608912" title="Norrland dialects">
Norrland dialects

North Swedish () is one of the six major dialect groupings of the Swedish language. It comprises the dialects in most of Norrland, except those of Gästrikland and southern Hälsingland, where Svealand Swedish is spoken. Local dialects from Härjedalen and northwest Jämtland (specifically Frostviken in Strömsund Municipality), which traditionally are counted as variants of the Norwegian dialect of Trøndersk, are also excluded, while Jamtlandic and other dialects of the region are considered to be true North Swedish.
The border between North Swedish and Svealand Swedish runs through Hälsingland, such that the northern Hälsingland dialects are regarded as North Swedish dialects and the southern ones as Svealand Swedish; an alternative delineation follows the southern border of Medelpad.
The old northern border of the Swedish language in coastal Norrbotten largely followed the eastern and northern borders of Lower and Upper Kalix parishes in modern Kalix Municipality. From there, an vaguely defined linguistic border ran through Lappmarken from the northernmost point of Upper Kalix parish in an arc to the south of Porjus, then followed the Lule River to the border with Norway.
The North Swedish dialects should not be confused with various Uralic languages (specifically, the Northern and Southern Sami languages as well as the Meänkieli dialect) which have been spoken for much longer in at least some parts of Norrland.
Historical origins.
North Swedish arose from the combined influence of the Old West Norse spoken in Trøndelag to the west and the Old East Norse spoken to the south. The westerly influences were notably strong in the centuries leading up to the Viking Era. The shift to East Norse progressed through the Middle Ages. As Norrland gradually came to be more and more under Central Swedish influence in the Modern Era, many of the older West Norse characteristics disappeared. The strong West Norse influences can still be seen today in the toponymy of Norrland in placenames ending in "-ånger" (, "harbour"). Parish names such Skön and Indal (both in Sundsvall Municipality) have West Nordic origins. The dialect of Norrbotten displays less West Nordic influence than other more westerly dialects. The greatest West Nordic/Norwegian—or, perhaps, least East Nordic/Swedish—influence is found in Jamtlandic.
Characteristics.
As with other regiolects, it is difficult to clearly define a unique set of characteristics for the North Swedish dialects. The distribution of different features of the dialect have differing boundaries (called isoglosses), which are described in the following summary of phenomena regarded as typical of North Swedish.
Note that some distinctive features of Northern Swedish are shared with some Norwegian dialects, primarily East Norwegian. Svealand Swedish also shares distinctive features with Northern Swedish.
Subdivisions.
Just as it is difficult to precisely define unique linguistic traits for North Swedish, it is also difficult to split the group geographically into various subdialects; different traits are found in different areas. Nevertheless, the mediaeval parishes have played a large role in the subdivision of the dialects of North Swedish. Even those parishes that were organised later in the 1600s, such as Upper Kalix parish and Burträsk parish, have strong dialectal features.
The Swedish language came to Lappmark in the 18th and 19th centuries as ethnic Swedes began to settle the area. They came from many different regions, and some even spoke Finnish or a Sami language natively. This resulted in a blending of both dialects and languages. Most of the Lappmark dialects thus lack such archaic features as the dative case and diphthongs that the dialects of the coastal parishes have retained. Nevertheless, the differences between the various Lappmark dialects can be considerable, depending on the heritage of those who settled in a given area. A notable amount of Sami loanwords have found their way into the dialects of Lappmark and the areas just to the south. For instance, the Siberian Jay is locally called "koxik" as opposed to the Standard Swedish "lavskrika".
Below is a list of common subdialectal divisions of North Swedish.
Kalix dialects.
These dialects, known in Swedish as "kalixmål", are spoken in the mediaeval Kalix parishes (present-day Kalix and Överkalix municipalities). Like other dialects in Norrbotten, the Kalix dialects retain numerous archaic features. Many Old Norse diphthongs have been preserved, as well as archaic consonant clusters such as "sj", "stj" and "lj". The dative case is also retained, including following a preposition. Additionally, verbs at least partially retain their old plural forms.
The Kalix dialect is further subdivided into
One difference between these two local variants is that the old consonant clusters "mb", "nd", and "ng" have been retained in Upper Kalix, but not in Lower Kalix. For example, the Standard Swedish "kam" ("comb" or "crest") is "kemb" in Upper Kalix, but "kap" in Lower Kalix. Furthermore, the Upper Kalix dialect has more influences from Sami languages and Meänkieli than other dialects of North Swedish.
Luleå dialects.
The Luleå dialects (Swedish: "lulemål") are spoken in and around the mediaeval parish of Luleå (present-day Boden and Luleå municipalities). They are also spoken in the easternmost parts of Lule lappmark up to near Vuollerim.
These dialects may be further subdivided as follows
The Luleå dialects are known for, among other things, a rich inventory of diphthongs. The Old Norse "ai", "au", and "öy" are preserved, as well as "ei" (e.g., "stein" for Standard Swedish "sten", meaning "stone"), "eo" (e.g., "heok" for Standard Swedish "hök", meaning hawk), and "oi" (e.g., "hoi" for Standard Swedish "hö", meaning "hay"). These dialects also have a number of vowels that differ from Standard Swedish. For example, Standard Swedish "i" becomes "öi" ("röis" instead of Standard "ris", meaning "rice"), while Standard "u" becomes "eo" or "eu" ("heos" instead of Standard "hus", meaning "house").
Piteå dialects.
The Piteå dialects (Swedish: "pitemål") are spoken in the area of the mediaeval Piteå parish (present-day Piteå and Älvsbyn municipalities) as well as in the southernmost parts of Jokkmokk Municipality and in northern Arvidsjaur Municipality in Pite lappmark. These dialects also preserve a number of archaic features, such as conserved diphthongs in words like "göuk" (Standard Swedish: "gök", "cuckoo bird") and "stein" (Standard Swedish: "sten", "stone"). The consonant clusters "mb", "nd", and "ng" are often retained, for example in "kamb" (Standard Swedish: "kam", "comb"). Unique to the Piteå dialects is that Old Swedish long "a" (modern "å") has become short "a" before "n", but nowhere else. Thus, "lan" (Standard Swedish: "lån", "loan"), but "båt" (Standard Swedish: "båt", "boat").
Settler dialects.
The so-called "settler dialects" (Swedish: "nybyggarmål") comprise all the Swedish dialects in Lappland; Karl-Hampus Dahlstedt geographically defines this dialect to those inland parts of Norrbotten where the Swedish dialects do not fit in with any of the relatively more clearly defined dialects of the coastal regions, due to the patchwork ancestry of the Swedish-speaking settlers that populated the area. One typical "settler dialect" is found in Arjeplog, which arose from a blending of Standard Swedish with the Piteå and Umeå dialects. There is also Sami influence on these dialects, such as the absence of the "thick L", which is generally typical of North Swedish dialects. Another area in which a "settler dialect" is spoken is Malmfälten.
North Westrobothnian.
North Westrobothnian (Swedish: "nordvästerbottniska mål") is spoken in the northern parts of Västerbotten, primarily the mediaeval Skellefteå parish (including Norsjö), together with a part of Pite lappmark (Malå and Arvidsjaur). Just like the coastal dialects of Norrbotten, North Westrobothnian preserves numerous archaic features. The dative case is still used, not only after prepositions but also after certain adjectives and verbs. Old Norse diphthongs have been preserved in many local dialects, but have developed in different, unique ways. For instance, Standard Swedish "öra" ("ear") can be "ööyr", "ääyr", or "aajr" in various local dialects of North Westrobothnian.
South Westrobothnian.
South Westrobothnian (Swedish: "sydvästerbottniska mål") is spoken along the Ume River from Umeå to Tärna and Sorsele, including Bygdeå and Holmön. A dialect is spoken in Lycksele lappmark which is highly reminiscent of dialects spoken in Umeå, Vännäs, and Degerfors (Vindeln). These influences become less apparent approaching the Norwegian border, but are still strong as far as Tärna, where an old Umeå substratum is evident. The local dialect of Sorsele is influenced by North Westrobothnian as well. South Westrobothnian also preserves archaic diphthongs, for instance in "bein" (Standard Swedish: "ben", "leg") and "ööys" (Standard Swedish: "ösa", "to scoop"). This is a characteristic that distinguishes South Westrobothnian from the Nordmaling and Bjurholm variants of the Ångermanland dialect to the south as well as a shared feature with North Westrobothnian. One difference between South and North Westrobothnian is that in South Westrobothnian, a "g" is often inserted between the old diphthong "au" and a following an "r" or "thick L". For example, South Westrobothnian "öger" is "aur" in North Westrobothnian (Standard Swedish: "ör", "gravelly ground").
Transitional dialects between Ångermanland and Västerbotten.
These dialects, intermediate between South Westrobothnian and the Ångermanland dialect, are spoken in Nordmaling and Bjurholm as well as Örträsk. These dialects are similar to the dialect of nolaskogs, such as in the change of Old Norse "hv-" to "gv-" ("gvit" as opposed to Standard Swedish "vit", meaning "white").
Ångermanländ dialects.
The Ångermanland dialects (Standard Swedish: "ångermanländska mål") are spoken in Ångermanland (with the exception of Nordmaling and Bjurholm) and Åsele lappmark. The dialects of Åsele and Vilhelmina have largely retained their Ångermanland character while still developing into their own. One exception is Fredrika parish, which developed a speech closer to Standard Swedish as a result of lying near major immigration routes from Ångermanland. The dialect of Dikanäs in Vilhelmina municipality is a transitional dialect between Ångermanland and the dialects of Lycksele lappmark.
The Ångermanland dialects may be further subdivided as follows:
Medelpad dialects.
The Medelpad dialects (Swedish: "medelpadsmål") are spoken in Medelpad, with the exception of the westernmost parish of Haverö, where the Hogdal dialects are spoken. In comparison to other North Swedish dialects, the Medelpad dialects are relatively uniform. The most important outer isogloss is the one with the Hälsing dialects to the south, which defines the limits of the "vowel balance" characteristic of North Swedish. One characteristic that distinguishes the Medelpad dialects (for example, Indal–Liden) from other nearby dialects is the pronunciation of both short and long "i" and "y" as the same, the so-called "Viby I". In Borgsjö and Torp, "y" is pronounced as "i", while "ö" is pronounced closer to "e". This trait is also found in the Hälsing dialects and in parts of Härjedalen. Other traits are shared with the Ångermanländ dialects, like the "thick "n"" sound after long vowels in words such as "van" ("experienced", "habituated to") and "måne" ("moon"). In the northernmost pars of Medelpad, the dialects show notable Jamtlandic influence. A characteristic typical for dialects of coastal Medelpad is short "u" in place of standard "ö".
Jamtlandic dialects.
The Jamtlandic dialects (Swedish: "jämtmål", "jämtska") comprise the dialects of Jämtland, with the exception of upper Frostviken, where the so-called Lid dialect ("Lidmålet") is spoken. These dialects are to a greater extent than other North Swedish dialects caught between easterly (i.e., Swedish) and westerly (i.e., Norwegian) linguistic influences. Centuries-old cultural and linguistic (and later political) ties to Norway mean that many westerly linguistic traits that have long since disappeared in the coastal dialects are preserved in Jamtlandic. For example, the vowel "u" in words such as "bu" (Standard Swedish: "bod", "hut"; cf. Norwegian: "bu") and "ku" (Standard Swedish: "ko", "cow"; cf. Norwegian: "ku"). Jamtlandic, like other North Swedish dialects, also retains the archaic diphthongs of Old Norse.
Hogdal dialects.
These dialects are spoken in Haverö and Ytterhogdal.
Hälsing dialects.
The commonly accepted isogloss between North Swedish and Svealand Swedish runs through Hälsingland. This area, however, is a typical transition region. From A Svealand standpoint, there are reasons to define the isogloss as coinciding with the southern border of Hälsingland (through Ödmården). From a Norrland standpoint, there are alternative reasons to define it as coinciding with the southern border of Medelpad, which would fit with the southern limit of vowel balance.
Included in the Hälsing dialects are the Hassela dialect (Swedish: "hasselamål") and the Forsa dialect (Swedish: "forsamål").
North Swedish dialects today.
As modern society has grown increasingly more fluid and interconnected, genuine local dialects are on the decline, in North Sweden as in many other parts of the world. Nevertheless, there often remains an unmistakable local character of the language, both among those who speak the pure dialect and among those who speak the regional standardised language. But aside from characteristic peculiarities in intonation, there are certain grammatical traits that seem likely to survive: e.g., the infinitive "måsta" (Standard Swedish: "måste"), present tense forms such as "han gå" (Standard Swedish: "han går", "he goes") and "han ropa" (Standard Swedish: "han ropar", "he calls"), and the uninflected predicative in a statement such as "dom ä trött" (Standard Swedish: "de är trötta", "they are tired").<ref name="Norrländsk uppslagsbok: Norrland/språk"/>
Documentation and preservation.
Nearly every small community has traditionally has its own distinct dialect, while the larger towns have had, for obvious reasons, greater linguistic influence. How well-documented various dialects are these days is largely dependent on the work of a host of local enthusiasts, as well as some academic research in the area of Nordic languages, such as the series ""Svenska Landsmål och svenskt folkliv"" ("Swedish Dialects and Folk Traditions"), by professor J. A. Lundell at Uppsala universitet, where the Swedish Dialect Alphabet was used beginning in 1910 for the writing of various local dialects of Swedish. In many areas, the genuine dialects are nearly extinct, but a few others have achieved near-official status. One such example is Jamtlandic, which is taught in a relatively well developed written language to schoolchildren as has a wide variety of literature both in written and audio format.

Roskilde station

Roskilde Station is the principal railway station serving the city of Roskilde, Denmark, situated on the Danish Main Line between Copenhagen and Jutland. The station is also a terminus for the Lille Syd Line which connects Roskilde to Næstved by way of Køge, and the Nordvest Line to Kalundborg.
Completed in 1847, it is the oldest railway station in Denmark still in use. It was listed in 1964.
History.
Roskilde railway station was built as part of the Copenhagen-Roskilde Line, Denmark's first railway line, which was completed for the Zealand Railway Company ("Det Sjællandske Jernbaneselskab") by British engineering company William Redford. It was long thought that the construction company also designed the station in Roskilde but it has later been established that the architect was J.F. Meyer, a Dane.
The design of the station is believed to have been inspired by Villa Borghese in Rome. Facing the city centre, the front of the original station building is symmetrical with two short rectangular towers with flat roofs flanking the main entrance. A loggia in front of the main entrance, now removed, was topped by a balcony in front of a restaurant.
Roskilde station was inaugurated in connection with the opening of the railway line on 26 June 1847. Copenhagen Central Station has been moved twice since then, the current building being from 1911, making Roskilde station the oldest station building in the country though both the building and platforms have been expanded several times over the years.
The station saw a major refurbishment from 1998 to 2002. The facade was brought back to its original colouring, the roof and tunnels were renovated, elevators and automatic doors were installed, and the arrival hall received new paving and furnishings.
The station building was listed in 1964. The adjacent carriage house complex from 1898/1920 was listed in 1991.
Services.
Roskilde station serves inter city, regional and international trains.

Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès

Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès (; 24 June 176713 June 1846) was a French geographer, author and translator, best remembered in the English speaking world for his translation of German ghost stories "Fantasmagoriana", published anonymously in 1812, which inspired Mary Shelley and John William Polidori to write "Frankenstein" and "The Vampyre" respectively. He was one of the founding members of the Société de Géographie, a member of the Société Asiatique, admitted to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, made an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has a street named after him in Le Havre and a mountain near Humboldt Bay.
Biography.
Born in Marseille on 24 June 1767, the son of Jacques-Joseph Eyriès, a "lieutenant de frégates du roi" ("lieutenant of the king's frigates"), and Jeanne-Françoise Deluy (1748–1826). He moved to Le Havre in 1772 when his father was promoted to "commandant de la Marine" ("commander of the Navy"), and went to study at the College of Juilly. Eyriès began to travel to England, Germany, Sweden and Denmark to learn their languages and study botany and mineralogy, and through it grew to love geography and travel. Returning to Le Havre, he began working in the armaments trade, including commercial expeditions to various parts of the world, while taking care of a natural history museum there. In 1794 he went to Paris to deliver his father, who had been detained as a suspect in the new Republic, moving there the following year to devote himself to his studies, where he attended lectures by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu and Georges Cuvier, and started collecting old travel books.
He was given a mission in 1804–1805 by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord and Napoleon to travel to Germany and rally the French emigrants there, chosen for his knowledge of the country and language and his discretion. He used the opportunity to continue his collection, but turned down the title "conseiller d’État" ("councillor of the State") to keep his independence, allowing him to devote himself entirely to geography and botany, and return to Paris to settle. As a speaker of nine languages, he translated many articles and books from German, English and Scandinavian languages into French, mostly on travel and geography, but also including "Fantasmagoriana" from a selection of German ghost stories, which he published anonymously in 1812. From that year he became one of the drafters of the "Biographie Universelle" under editor Joseph François Michaud, writing many articles for it up until his death. His quality as a translator and extensive scientific knowledge earned him the friendship and admiration of many respected scientists, notably including Alexander von Humboldt and Conrad Malte-Brun, the latter of whom he joined in 1819 to continue the publication of "Nouvelles Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie et de l’Histoire", a journal dedicated to the advancement of the earth sciences.
In 1821 he became one of the 217 founding members of the world's first geographical society, the Société de Géographie, remaining one of the most active and on its central committee until his death; he was named honorary president, a prestigious title given to the likes of Pierre-Simon Laplace, Georges Cuvier, Alexander von Humboldt and François-René de Chateaubriand. He was a recognised geographer, and Jules Dumont d'Urville named a mountain "Eyriès" after him near Humboldt Bay during his voyage on the "Astrolabe". He was admitted to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1839, and was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1844.
Eyriès suffered a stroke in 1844, rendering him incapable of further work, and died on 13 June 1846 at the house of his brother Alexandre Eyriès, the mayor of Graville near Le Havre, and was buried in the cemetery of Graville priory, with an inscription on his tombstone after Edme François Jomard. He left a library of about 20,000 volumes collected throughout his life, which reflect his interest in rare and old works on travel and geography, and included almost everything written on Normandy, Le Havre and Provence, with rare maps from the German and Scandinavian countries, some of which are not even in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Many of these books, and some of his manuscripts, remain as of 2006 in the municipal library of Le Havre, and a street "Rue Jean Baptiste Eyries" was named after him in the city. Eyriès was remembered by his contemporaries for his erudition, selfless dedication, prodigious memory, critical thinking and modesty, and Pierre Larousse wrote of him: "Many people still remember seeing a little old man in antiquated clothes, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and reading along the waterfront: that was Eyriès, who worked to fill his vast memory and his rich library at the same time."

Church of St Mary the Virgin, Beighton

The Church of St Mary the Virgin is situated in Beighton, a suburb of the City of Sheffield. It is located just off High Street, it is the parish church for the parish of Beighton and a Grade II* listed building. Although the original church dated from the 12th century there is no remaining trace of the Medieval structure, it is dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus. The present minister is Mike Healey.
History and architecture.
Beighton was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 but there was no reference to any church in the settlement. It is believed that St. Mary’s dates from the year c.1150, this is based on the discovery of a disintegrating late Norman semi-circular chancel arch which was unearthed during late 19th century repair work. The first documented mention of the church is in an undated deed written during the reign of Edward I (1272-1307). At that time the church was dedicated to Saint Radegund who originated in Thuringia, there is no date for the change of dedication to St Mary and as late as 1557 there was a mention of "“the churche yard of V(ir)gyn Radegond at Beghton”"
The tower arch is thought to be the oldest part of the present building and may date to the 13th century, while the north aisle dates from the 15th century, there was probably once a chantry chapel at its east end. There was a period of rebuilding and alteration towards the end of the 14th century that saw the addition of a pointed chancel arch and nave arcades. There was further restoration in 1773 but by the 1860s the church was in a dilapidated state and the newly appointed minister the Reverend George Antrobus employed the Chesterfield architect Samuel Rollinson (1827-1891) to oversee an extensive programme of reconstruction and renovation which took place between October 1867 and December 1868. The work included taking down the walls of the chancel and the south aisle and rebuilding them on the original footprint, the Clerestory windows to the nave were removed, and a gallery at the west end of the church was taken down. Bench pews replaced the box pews allowing for the capacity of the church to be increased to 291.
The north door or Devil's door, was blocked up at one time and then later re-opened. The devil’s door was left ajar during baptisms to release any evil spirits in the child. On the north side of the chancel are two gravestones, one of these refers to the Jermyns, a wealthy family who owned property in Beighton, Hackenthorpe and Eckington. There is a Hagioscope or squint cut into the wall between the chancel and the nave, this enabled worshippers to see the priest’s actions indirectly. Two brasses on the south wall of the nave mark the resting places of William Jessoppe, vicar of Beighton, who died in 1667 and M. Robert Jessoppe of Waterthorp Gent who died in 1753. The rood was designed by Ninian Comper.
In December 2006, Ed Dennison Archaeological Services Ltd were commissioned by the church council to conduct archaeological observations during internal refurbishment of the church and the replacement of the external drainage system. The result of this observation found no evidence of any remaining features connected with the original medieval church. The most noteworthy feature uncovered was the rediscovery of an early stone floor, last recorded in 1816 and buried in the 1867 restoration. The floor is thought to date from the early 16th century.

Interhotel

Interhotel was an East German chain of luxury hotels. It was founded in 1965 as a chain.
Originally, the hotel chain consisted of a hotel each in Berlin, Erfurt, Jena and Magdeburg, two hotels in Chemnitz (then Karl-Marx-Stadt) and five hotels in Leipzig.
5-star hotels were exclusively for guests from non-socialist states, 4-star hotels were mainly for guests from Comecon countries, for example, Park Inn Berlin (then Stadt Berlin) was built for Soviet people. There were also some 3-star hotels in smaller towns, such as "Hotel Elephant" in Weimar.
Practically all luxury hotels in East Germany were part of the Interhotel chain, notable exceptions being hotel "Neptun" in Warnemünde and Cecilienhof castle in Potsdam.
After German reunification, most of the hotels were still run by Interhotel AG. In 1991, some hotels were sold to the Klingbeil group, and in December 2006 some were sold to the Blackstone Group.
The Interhotel hotels were under the control of the East German state security service, the Stasi, under the Tourist Department. The Stasi tried to monitor the activities of international tourists, by sending prostitutes to audio- and video-controlled hotel rooms. They focused on hotels where political decisions were discussed, such as Hotel Bellevue in Dresden.

St. Mary Magdalene's Church, Gilsland

St. Mary Magdalene’s Church is a small mid-Victorian Anglican church on an isolated hillside in north-east Cumbria, England. It is the parish church of Gilsland, but is located almost a mile from the village and may have been intended as much for the use of visitors to the nearby Gilsland Spa hotel as for the village. It is noteworthy in that the founder, G.G. Mounsey, a local landowner and first elected mayor of Carlisle, published a detailed summary of his reasons for building the church and thus threw into relief some of the reasoning behind Victorian church building and restoration.
Services at St Mary Magdalene's are conventionally Anglican in character, with an emphasis on informality.
History.
The church was started in 1851 but not consecrated until Oct 3rd 1854. It was built, at a cost of £800, and partly endowed by George Gill Mounsey of Rockcliffe, Carlisle who also erected the nearby Gilsland Spa Hotel in 1860. He employed the same architect, Mr. James Stewart of Carlisle for both of these buildings. A new parish of Gilsland was created for the church, derived from the parish of Lanercost. It is 18,240 acres in area, stretching some 13 miles north of the village to the borders of Keilder Forest and south to the A69. To the east the parish abuts Greenhead parish in the diocese of Newcastle and in the west the parish of Nether Denton.
George Mounsey sets the founding of the church in a wider historical context in his book. He points out how, after the destruction of nearby Lanercost Abbey by Henry VIII, no provision was made to replace the ministry provided by the monks to the surrounding area and suggests that there was a decline in moral standards as a consequence. Mounsey provides evidence that priests assigned to the parish found it difficult to support themselves from the scanty tithes available and that his foundation and endowment of St Mary Magdalene's was an attempt to rectify the situation.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The church is built of rough stone to a simple layout in Early English style. It has a large porch on the south side of the nave and the corbels supporting the arch of the doorway have carvings of the heads of Bishop Waldegrave and Queen Victoria. Two other heads adorn the east wall, one of which appears to represent St Mary Magdalene. There is a small belfry containing one bell made by J Blaylock in 1852, bearing the inscription "Soli Deo Laus Hominibus Pax" (Peace to men, praise to God alone).
The stained glass window behind the altar and the two windows in the west wall were made by Scott of Carlisle. The window above the altar depicts St. Mary Magdalene, to whom this church is dedicated. She is shown holding a white lily, her emblem. The two west windows show St. Peter and St Paul. All three originally formed panels of one large west window in Rockcliffe church and were brought from there by George Mounsey when the Rockcliffe window was being altered. The Mary Magdalene panel was shorter than the aperture it was fitted into and the extra length had to be filled with plain glass.
Interior.
The stone pulpit and font are contemporary with the church. In the Chancel is the two-manual organ by Harrison and Harrison of Durham, which was installed in 1901 at a cost of £172. The carved oak choir stalls together with the prayer desk near the font were made by Mr. James Wilson, a local joiner who lived in Mumps Hall in the village. He also carved the oak chancel screen, the top of which was removed in 1958 and now forms the front of the altar.
The oak reredos and panelling are in memory of George Mounsey, founder of the church. A brass plaque in his commemoration can be found on the panelling to the right of the organ. There is a second plaque, nearer the organ, in memory of the former organist and choir master, W.R. Wright, son of the vicar Adam Wright mentioned on the lectern.

Never Too Late (horse)

Never Too Late (foaled 10 March 1957) was an American-bred, French-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career lasting from August 1959 until October 1960, the filly ran nine times and won four races. As a two-year-old she proved herself capable of competing against the leading French colts by winning the Prix de la Salamandre at Longchamp and being narrowly beaten in the Grand Criterium. In the following year she was sent to Britain where she won the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket and Oaks at Epsom. She was then retired to stud at the end of her three-year-old season, and had some success as a broodmare.
Background.
Never Too Late was a small chestnut filly bred by her owner Mrs Howell E. (Dorothy) Jackson's Bull Run Stud. Never Too Late's dam, Gloria Nicky was the top-rated British two-year-old filly of 1954, when her wins included the Cheveley Park Stakes. She was a half sister to Libra, a mare who produced the St Leger Stakes winners Ribocco and Ribero. Gloria Nicky was pregnant with her first foal (Never Too Late) when she was sold to Mrs Jackson for £30,000 in 1956. Never Too Late was from the second crop of foals sired by the Epsom Derby winner Never Say Die. The filly was sent to be trained in France by Etienne Pollet. When racing in Britain, the filly was known as Never Too Late II.
Racing career.
Never Too Late began her racing career in August 1959 when she finished fifth in a maiden race at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse before winning a similar event at Longchamp. In September she was stepped up markedly in class to contest the Prix de la Salamandre. The race at Longchamp was open to both colts and fillies and attracted a field which included the Prix Morny winner Pharamond. Never Too Late won the 1400m event, beating Pharamond into second. A month later, Never Too Late was again matched against colts in the Grand Criterium over 1600m. On this occasion she finished second, beaten a short neck to Angers, a colt who started favourite for the 1961 Epsom Derby.
Never Too Late began her three-year-old season in the Prix Imprudence at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, which she won impressively by four lengths from Paola. The filly was then sent to England to contest the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile. Ridden by Roger Poincelet she started 8/11 favourite against thirteen opponents. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and won easily by two lengths from Lady In Trouble and Running Blue. Never Too Late returned to Britain a month later and started 6/5 favourite. The finish of the race was rough and controversial. Poincelet held the favourite up towards the back of the field, and struggled to obtain a clear run before making his challenge on the outside in the straight. As she moved up to the French-trained leader Paimpont, Never Too Late hung to the left and blocked the run of a third French filly, Imberline. Never Too Late caught Paimpont in the closing strides and won by a head, with Imberline an apparently unlucky third. After the race, Poincelet alleged that some of the British jockeys had deliberately hampered his progress on three separate occasions, while Etienne Pollet claimed that the filly would have won by six lengths with a clear run.
In September, Never Too Late ran in the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp. Racing on soft ground, she did not reproduce her earlier form and finished unplaced behind Leghinka. On her final appearance, Never Too Late was sent to England for a third time to contest the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. She finished second to the Italian filly Marguerite Vernaut.
Retirement.
Never Too Late returned to America to become a broodmare. The best of her offspring was Without Fear, a colt sired by Baldric, who won the Prix Herod and became a leading sire in Australia. Her female-line descendants include the VRC Oaks winner Lovelorn.
Assessment and honours.
Never Too Late was given a Timeform rating of 130 in 1959, when she was the highest rated two-year-old filly in Europe. She was rated 128 in 1960.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Never Too Late an "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks.
Pedigree.
Never Too Late was inbred 4x4 to Blenheim, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

The Tale of a Tiger

The Tale of a Tiger (Italian title: "La storia della tigre") is a dramatic monologue by Dario Fo. Fo collected material for it during a June 1975 visit to China with his wife Franca Rame and other members of their theatre company, and he toured around Italy with it in 1978.
Plot summary.
During Mao's Long March across China, a revolutionary soldier is wounded. His comrades leave him behind. Gangrene sets in, and he believes that he is about to die. He drags himself into a cave and falls into a deep sleep. When he awakens, he is confronted by the sight of a female tiger and her cub. What follows is a comic narrative about their domestic life together, as the tiger nurses him back to health.

2012–13 Scottish Premier Under-20 League

The 2012–13 Scottish Premier Under 20 League (also known as the "Clydesdale Bank Under-20 Premier League" due to sponsorship reasons) was the fifteenth season of the Scottish Premier under-20 League, the highest youth Scottish football league, and also the first season under the new under 20 format. It began on August 2012 and ended in May 2013.
Changes.
The league was converted from under-19 to under-20 and was expanded from 12 to 15 teams. The under-20 sides of the relegated Scottish Premier League club Dunfermline Athletic and the clubs finishing third and fourth in the Scottish Football League took up a place in the new league. A position in the league for teams outside the SPL was based on their youth academy's elite status.
The definition of an under-20 player is a player who has not attained the age of 19 years on 31 December of the year before the relevant season commences. Additionally, a limited number of overage players are allowed to compete in each fixture. The under-20 league was adopted in order to promote the development of youth footballers and to assist in their progression to the full professional game, when compared to the under-18 or under-19 format.
League table.
Matches.
Teams played each other twice, once at home, once away.

Nancy Angelo

Nancy Angelo (born October 8, 1953 in Carson City, Nevada, USA) is an organizational psychologist and formerly a performance and video artist who took part in the feminist art movement in Los Angeles. As an artist, she is best known for co-founding the collaborative performance art group The Feminist Art Workers in 1976 with Candace Compton, Cheri Gaulke, and Laurel Klick.
After studying photography in Denmark and attending San Francisco Art Institute, Angelo moved to Los Angeles in 1975 in order to enroll in the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman’s Building. She took an active part in refurbishing the old three-story structure on North Spring Street near Chinatown that housed the Woman’s Building and making it suitable for learning and practicing art.
Career.
Feminist Art Workers.
Shortly after enrolling in the FSW, Angelo immersed herself in performance art and in 1976 she co-founded Feminist Art Workers with Cheri Gaulke, Laurel Klick, and Candace Compton (later replaced by Vanalyne Green). In an attempt to mobilize the strategies of feminist education in the field of performance art, the Feminist Art Workers used performance to create an empowering network for women in and outside of Los Angeles. In 1978, FAW created "Traffic in Women: A Feminist Vehicle" (1978), performed at various sites between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Prior to embarking on this project, the group conducted research on the subject of prostitution and the actual traffic in women between these two cities. In 1980, FAW embarked on an even more ambitious project, "Bill of Rights", which the group performed from 1980 to 1982 in 15 states that have not passed the Equal Rights Amendment at the time. This project emerged on the heels of major demonstration in Washington, D.C., which took place in 1978 when 100,000 marched the streets demanding equal rights. It was just one of many efforts, initiated by feminists across the nation, to ensure the ratification of ERA by 1982.
Video art.
In 1976, Angelo and Compton directed "Nun and Deviant", considered by many to be the key text of the feminist video art. By taking on the roles of a nun (Angelo) and a deviant (Compton), the two artists reflected on “prototypical or actual lesbian models.” At this time, Angelo’s experiments in performance art coincided with her involvement with local video production. Thus, during the same year, Angelo, Annette Hunt, Candace Compton, and Jerri Allyn established the Los Angeles Women’s Video Center, located at the Woman’s Building. LWVC supported the work of prominent feminist video-makers such as Cheri Gaulke, Suzanne Lacy, and Vanalyne Green. During the first decade of its existence, some 350 videotapes were produced.
Collaborative work.
In 1979, Angelo took part in "An Oral Herstory of Lesbianism", initiated by Terry Wolverton and performed at the Woman’s Building. Apart from Angelo, the event involved many other participants in LA performance art scene: Cheri Gaulke, Jerri Allyn, Leslie Belt, Chutney Gunderson, Brook Hallock, Sue Maberry, Louise Moore, Arlene Raven, Catherine Stifter, Cheryl Swannack, and Christine Wong. At the time, Wolverton was involved with the Lesbian Art Project at the Woman’s Building and she proposed to create Herstory in an effort to “chronicle the lives of lesbians.” The project opened with ten workshops devoted to teaching performance skills and techniques as well as to exploring issues of lesbianism.
During the same year, Angelo and Leslie Labowitz initiated the "Incest Awareness Project", a collaboration between "Ariadne: A Social Art Network and the Women's Resources Program of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center" (of which Angelo was a member). The project attracted a large number of feminist artists including Leslie Belt, Jerri Allyn, Paula Lumbard, Bia Lowe, Terry Wolverton, Tyaga, Chris Wong, and many others. As a part of her involvement in the project, Angelo produced and exhibited "Equal Time/Equal Space", an interactive multi-monitor video work. Committed to shedding light on violence against women, her project invited open dialogue on the subject of incest at the time when it was not publicly discussed.
In 1981, Angelo co-founded another performance group, Sisters of Survival (SOS) that focused on anti-nuclear issues. The group formed after the dissolution of Feminist Art Workers, when two former FAW members, Gaulke and Angelo, decided to join forces with members of another LA-based group, The Waitresses. The original lineup included Angelo, Gaulke, Jerri Allyn, Anne Gauldin, and Sue Maberry. As a part of their performance, the members of SOS “dressed in nun’s habits of all colors of the rainbow to represent an image of ‘global sisterhood.’”
Current work.
After leaving Sisters of Survival and ending her association with the Woman’s Building, Angelo decided to continue her education and obtain a Ph.d in organizational psychology from the California School of Professional Psychology in Los Angeles. Currently, she lives in the Bay Area and provides organization development services as a part of Angelo + Garnets consulting firm.

<doc id="36609375" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36609375" title="Communications ToolBox">
Communications ToolBox

The Communications Toolbox, generally shortened to Comm Toolbox or CTB, was a suite of application programming interfaces, libraries and device drivers for the classic Mac OS that implemented a wide variety of serial and network communication protocols.
Using the CTB, one could write an application that would seamlessly work over AppleTalk, a modem or any variety of other connections. Developers could also write plug-in communications modules known as "Tools", allowing any CTB-aware application to use that connection method.
CTB was notoriously slow and buggy, and received mixed support from developers. Examples of applications using it for simple tasks were common, but many target uses, like terminal emulators, almost always ran faster when designed to target a single connection type and avoid the CTB.
Description.
The CTB was based on a shared library concept in an era when the Mac OS did not include a shared library system. Instead, the CTB wrote its own driver manager layer, the Communications Resource Manager. The Resource Manager was responsible for installing and managing the various drivers, or "Tools" that provided various functions within the CTB system. There were three primary types of Tools, each with their own associated Manager: the Connection Manager handled the communications drivers that opened channels to remote services, the Terminal Manager managed Tools that implemented the character conversion and command string interpretation needed to support any sort of terminal emulator, and the File Transfer Manager did the same for any sort of file transfer protocol.
Applications could use any, or all, of the Managers in the CTB. A typical terminal emulator would use all of them, connecting a Tool selected in the Connection Manager to another in the Terminal Manager, and then periodically using the File Transfer Manager on user request. Such was the case for common terminal emulators like VersaTerm and MacTerminal. However, another application might use only one of these, say the Connection Manager to set up communications. QuickMail and Eudora are well-known examples. Applications typically used the GUI elements supplied by the Managers to handle user interaction, but could also enumerate the tools on their own to provide a custom GUI.
Perhaps the best known Tool was the Apple Modem Tool, which provided both the serial communications drivers as well as a system for storing setup commands. When a connection was initiated using the Modem Tool, the link to the modem was opened, commands sent to it, and the link established by dialling. The Modem Tool was also indicative of the problems that the CTB had in general; it was slow, lacking in features, quickly became outdated as modem speeds improved, and saw little development effort or support. When a 1.5 version addressing some of the problems was released in 1993, even finding it proved difficult. A further update was needed to support higher speeds when 28kbit/s modems become common. Apple also produced the simple Serial Tool and AppleTalk Tools as additional connection methods, the TTY and VT102 Tools for terminal emulation, and the Text and XModem tools for file transfers.
Third party tools were common for supporting connections, including the TelePort modem which plugged into the Apple Desktop Bus and thus required custom drivers, Apple's own X.25 and ISDN tools, and a variety of other examples.

Ciro Annunchiarico (in Italian: Ciro Annicchiarico) (also known as: Papa Ciro) (Born: Grottaglie, 16 December 1775 – Died: Francavilla Fontana, 8 February 1817) was an Italian cult leader.
Early life.
He was the son of wealthy parents. He entered the priesthood at a young age and seemed destined for priesthood.
Murder of Giovanni Montolesi.
He seduced a young woman who was engaged to Giovanni Montolesi, the son of a wealthy merchant. When Montolesi learned of the affair, he sought out Annunchiarico and reproached him for bringing shame to the priesthood and dishonor to his fiancée. Without a word, Annunchiarico drew a dagger from his belt and stabbed Montolesi in the heart. He later swore a blood-feud against the entire Montolesi family, declaring that the man whom he had murdered had insulted him and the entire Roman Catholic priesthood. Over the next few months he ambushed and murdered thirteen members of the Montolesi clan. Pursued by the authorities, he then fled with some friends into the mountains.
Gang leader.
He organized in late 1816 and 1817, the confederation of robbers with a strength of 20,000 people. The name they used for themselves was "The Decided Ones of Jupiter the Thunderer". Their leader Ciro Annunchiarico claimed to be the earthly avatar of the ancient Roman god Jupiter.
Charisma.
He seemed to have had an extraordinary if not mysterious power of charisma, as tens of thousands of hardened bandits readily obeyed him and acknowledged his bizarre claims.
Further murders.
He is supposed to have killed between sixty and seventy men by his own hand.
Execution.
His bandit group was eventually attacked by a force of German and Swiss mercenaries under the command of an Englishman, General Church.
He was later executed by a firing squad.

Basil Cochrane

Basil Cochrane (born 22 April 1753; died Paris, France, 12 or 14 August 1826) was a Scottish civil servant, businessman, inventor, and wealthy nabob of early 19th century England.
Early life.
The sixth son of Scottish nobleman and politician Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald, by his second wife Jane Stuart, Cochrane was probably named for his father's brother Basil Cochrane (died 1788), at the time Governor of the Isle of Man and later a member of the Scottish Board of Customs. At the age of sixteen Basil was given a place in the East India Company in Madras. From 1783-5 he served as a revenue administrator in Nagapattinam, which had been seized from the Dutch in 1781. During his time there he was accused of having two locals, including one named Vaidyanada, beaten to death. After a trial in Madras in 1787, he was acquitted by a British jury.
Nabob.
In 1792 Basil Cochrane took over supply contracts for the British navy in India from his brother John, who had held them since 1790. The demand for provisions was so great that Basil had flour mills and bakeries built at Calcutta and Madras to fulfill his contracts. He also financed "Cochrane's Canal" (now the Buckingham Canal) which improved navigation to Madras.
In 1806 Cochrane handed over the contracts to the partnership of James Baker and James Balfour.
He returned to England, having accumulated an enormous fortune (he had held contracts over the years totalling £1,418,236) to spend the next thirteen years disputing his accounts with the Victualling Board. He built a large house at 12 Portman Square, where he was able to socialize with his brother Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone, his nephew Lord Cochrane, and others. In 1807 he financed the campaigns of his brothers Andrew and George in the notorious rotten borough of Grampound to place them in Parliament, perhaps to increase pressure on the government to settle his accounts. He purchased, with partner George Hunter, the Scottish estate of Auchterarder in 1808 and assumed the titles. After Cochrane's accounts were settled in 1819, he published several works criticizing the Victualing Board's conduct towards him and calling for reforms in the process.
Basil Cochrane married Caroline Gostling (d. 1837), widow of Rev. Samuel Lawry, in 1812; they had no children. Cochrane died in Paris in 1826 and is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery there. A portrait miniature of Cochrane exists, painted in 1789 in India by John Smart.
Vapour baths.
Cochrane published several works promoting the use of "vapour baths" or steam baths for medical purposes, with apparatus that he had improved on himself. He also had a steam bath installed at his house in Portman Square and allowed the public to use it. Cochrane employed Indian immigrant Sake Dean Mahomed, who may have been the one to introduce Indian "shampooing" or massage to England there. (The term "shampoo" later came to mean the special soap used in massaging the scalp.)
The Cochranes.
The Earl of St. Vincent, Admiral of the Fleet, wrote of the Cochrane brothers in 1806, "The Cochranes are not to be trusted out of sight, they are all mad, romantic, money-getting and not truth-telling—and there is not a single exception in any part of the family." Basil Cochrane's eldest living brother, Archibald Cochrane, 9th Earl of Dundonald (1748–1831), was an inventor and entrepreneur. Alexander Cochrane (1758–1832) was an admiral. Andrew (1767–1833) was a soldier, businessman, and adventurer who fled the country after being convicted in the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814.
James Boswell, the famous diarist and biographer of Samuel Johnson, was a grandson of Euphemia Cochrane, sister of Basil's father Thomas and his namesake Commissioner Basil Cochrane. Boswell visited his Cochrane relatives and exchanged letters, but did not mention the younger Basil Cochrane, perhaps because he was 13 years younger and left for India in 1769 at the age of 16.
The Stuarts.
Basil Cochrane had two notable uncles on his mother's side, Andrew Stuart, a lawyer and MP, and Major General James Stuart, who had a turbulent military career in India from 1775-1782.

Kim Ji-yeon

Kim Ji-Yeon (Hangul: 김지연) (born 12 March 1988 in Busan) is a South Korean sabre fencer.
She is the 2012 Olympic Champion in the Women's Sabre Individual Fencing. Kim is the first South Korean woman to win an Olympic gold medal in fencing and the second South Korean female fencer to win any Olympic medal after Nam Hyun-Hee, who won silver in 2008. She is also the second South Korean fencer to win a gold medal at the Summer Olympics, following male foil fencer Kim Young-Ho.
Biography.
Kim began fencing at age 13 as a foil fencer, but converted to sabre in high school at age 16 in 2004.
Although she first became a member of the South Korean national fencing team at the age of 18 in 2006, Kim was often overshadowed by fellow sabre fencers Kim Hye-Lim, Lee Shin-Mi and Kim Keum-Hwa, omitted from the final national squad before becoming a fixture in the 2011 season.
Kim began to garner international attention at the 2011 Summer Universiade where she won the bronze medal in the women's individual sabre fencing. In the semifinals, Kim lost to two-time European champion and eventual gold medalist Olha Kharlan of Ukraine 15-10. She accumulated another bronze medal in the women's team sabre as a member of Team South Korea. Kim finished the 2011 season as her first full-time member of the national team, and her FIE ranking rose from 174 to 11.
In February 2012, Kim reached the semifinals at the Orléans Grand Prix, her first international tournament of the 2012 season. Next month, Kim reached her first individual sabre final at the Antalya World Cup in Turkey.
In May 2012, Kim became a semi-finalist at the Bologna World Cup in Italy and the Tianjin Grand Prix in China in a row. Her success in these tournaments increased her FIE ranking to 5th before the start of the 2012 Olympics.
2012 Olympics.
Kim competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London capturing the gold medal in the women's individual sabre event. This was South Korea's second Olympic gold medal in fencing, Kim Young-Ho having won the men's foil Gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics.
Kim reached the final when she defeated two-time Olympic individual sabre champion Mariel Zagunis 15–13 in the semifinal match. Largely regarded as the underdog by both competitors and her teammates, she came back from a 12–5 deficit against Zagunis to advance into the finals.
Kim beat Russia's Sofya Velikaya, the reigning world champion, 15–9 in the gold medal match. Kim asserted her dominance early in the contest, with her opponent having little say in the outcome of the first period with an 8–5 triumph for Kim. Velikaya struggled to recover from the setback and the second period followed in much the same way as the first as Kim won 7–4 to win the gold medal.

German submarine U-264

German submarine "U-264" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 21 June 1941 at the "Bremer-Vulkan-Vegesacker Werft" (yard) in Bremen as 'werk' 29. She was launched on 2 April 1942 and commissioned on 22 May under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Hartwig Looks.
In five patrols, she sank three ships of 16,843 GRT. She was a member of eleven wolf pack.
She was sunk on 19 February 1944 by British warships.
Service history.
After training with the 8th U-boat Flotilla, the boat became operational on 1 November 1942 when she was transferred to the 6th flotilla.
1st and 2nd patrols.
"U-264"s first patrol began when she departed Kiel on 3 November 1942. She entered the Atlantic Ocean after negotiating the gap between the Faroe and the Shetland Islands. On 17 November, she sank the "Mount Taurus". She was attacked by a Norwegian corvette, HNoMS "Potentilla", on the 20th. No damage was sustained. She entered St. Nazaire in occupied France, on 4 December.
The boat's second sortie was relatively uneventful.
3rd patrol.
On 26 February 1943 just off Cape Finisterre she fired a salvo of four torpedoes at but all four missed; Sussex had just attacked and sunk the German Tanker "Hohenfriedburg".
On 17 April 1943, she was in the process of attacking Convoy HX 233 when she was attacked by the escorts. The boat was badly damaged, but was repaired by the crew and the patrol continued. She then sank the "Harperley" and the "West Maximus" south of Cape Farewell (Greenland) on 5 May. She docked at Lorient, on the French Atlantic coast, on 1 June.
There then followed a pair of short 'hops' between Lorient and St. Nazaire in August and September 1943.
4th patrol.
While on her fourth patrol, "U-264" and two other U-boats were re-fuelling from the supply submarine on 4 October 1943 when they were surprised by aircraft from the American carrier . The more nimble Type VIIs escaped, but the 'milch cow' was sunk by the Avengers. "U-264" did not remain unscathed for long; later that day she was attacked, the damage inflicted forced a return to base.
5th patrol and loss.
For her final sortie, she was again in the Atlantic. She was sunk by depth charges dropped by the British sloops and on 19 February 1944.
There were no deaths, fifty-two men survived.

Amigonian Friars

The Capuchin Tertiary Friars of Our Lady of Sorrows (abbreviated as T.C.), or Capuchin Tertiaries, commonly called the Amigonian Friars, are a religious institute of men founded in Spain during the 19th century which specializes in working with young boys facing issues of juvenile delinquency and drug addiction. They follow the Rule of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis.
Foundation.
The friars were founded by Bishop Luis Amigó Ferrer, O.F.M. Cap., (1854 - 1934) on 12 April 1889 in Massamagrell, in the Province of Valencia, Spain. Amigó, a Capuchin friar, had a ministry of service to the prisons. In the course of this work, he frequently found boys, even pre-teenagers, locked up as prisoners, due to the poverty of their families. He wanted to give these boys the support they needed to break out of this cycle of poverty. 
To this end, Amigó established the friars to provide institutions of care and training for poor boys. The first group of 19 novices for the new institute made their first religious profession on 24 June 1890. They established several reform schools and orphanages. Early in their history, the friars developed a particular program of education for their schools, which they term "Amigonian Pedagogy". It is based on the Gospels, having as its principal models the images of the Good Shepherd, the lost sheep and the Good Samaritan. Its goal is:
the re-education, rehabilitation, correction and reform of children and youth who, for diverse factors, have come into conflict with themselves and with society.
Amigó also founded a religious institute of women, called the Capuchin Tertiary Sisters of the Holy Family. There is also a group of laypeople who support and work with the Amigonian Friars and Religious Sisters. Young people are organized to help in the mission of the institute into Amigonian Youth. Together all these various fruits of the work of Amigó form the "Amigonian Family".
Spirituality.
The friars follow a spirituality based in the vision of St. Francis of Assisi, given to them by their founder, a Capuchin Friar Minor. They also model themselves on the role of Our Lady of Sorrows, who stood at the foot of the Cross, sharing her son's agony and love for the world. She is a model to the friars of the generosity, mercy, strength and tenderness needed in the mission of serving their charges.
Martyrs.
During the Spanish Civil War, the institutions of the friars throughout Spain were closed by various militias associated with the Second Spanish Republic. Many of the friars were arrested, and 19 were executed in various locations throughout the country during the summer of 1936. They are honored as martyrs for the Catholic faith and have been declared Venerable by the Catholic Church.
Presence.
The friars today serve on four continents, and in the Philippines. In Spain, they run about twenty institutions of education and social service. Outside of Spain there is one community each in Ivory Coast and Poland, with another two communities in Germany.
Communities of friars also serve throughout the Americas, from the United States and Mexico and throughout South America and in the Caribbean. The General Motherhouse is located in Rome, Italy.

Dean Hall (game designer)

Dean "Rocket" Hall (born 14 May 1981) is a game designer from Oamaru, New Zealand. He is known for being the designer of the "ARMA 2" mod "DayZ". He was nominated for the Online Innovation Award at the GDC Online Awards 2012. Hall was a Commissioned Officer of the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals in the New Zealand Army and attended survival training in Brunei where he came up with the basic idea for "DayZ".
Early life and education.
Hall grew up in Oamaru, New Zealand, and attended Waitaki Boys High School. He started video game development on an Amiga personal computer his parents purchased him as a child.
Military service.
Hall served as a commissioned officer in the Royal New Zealand Air Force for five years, completing a degree at the University of Otago under a Defense Scholarship. In 2009 Hall re-enlisted in the New Zealand Army and was posted on an exchange program with the Singapore Armed Forces. Hall was inspired by his efforts on survival training and in using video games as a method to train soldiers in the emotional reactions they may face, including him pitching the concept to leadership within the Army. When interest was not shown, Hall stated he decided to add zombies and release it publicly.
Hall was posted to the Singapore Armed Forces on an exchange program during which he completed his survival training in Brunei. His experiences on this trip formed the basis for his ideas with the development of the mod. Hall was not used to the diet during his period of deployment, and this became a further problem as the training progressed. He ran out of food during the survival component eventually resorting to trying to eat rotten fish and ferns. By the end of his training, Hall weighed 25 kilograms less and required surgery to repair his injuries.
Video game career.
After leaving the air force, Hall was employed as a producer at Sidhe Interactive in Wellington, New Zealand and worked on "". He later created DayZ, a zombie survival horror mod for the "ARMA 2" tactical shooter game by Bohemia Interactive. Hall briefly left the industry to return to the army before returning for a contract at Bohemia Interactive on "ArmA 3". After the success of the mod, Hall started work at Bohemia as an employee in the position of Project Lead of the standalone version of "DayZ". He has also worked on Kerbal Space Program mods, creating the original Component Space Shuttle mod.
Views on the video game industry.
Hall has stated that the Xbox 360 and PS3 are at the end of their lives as of 2012, and that this has resulted in the PC providing more innovative games for the market. Hall states that he believes this will result in the next generation of consoles competing for the ability to cater to this desire for innovation as seen on the PC. Hall has been critical of the traditional publishing model for video games, turning down many offers to publish "DayZ" and asking what value publishers provide in a modern context. Hall was quoted as suggesting that publishers are becoming "irrelevant", citing "Minecraft" as an example of this.
Personal life.
Mountaineering.
Hall is an accomplished mountaineer, having climbed Mount Cook in New Zealand. In May 2013, he summitted Mount Everest, making him the 42nd New Zealander to do so. He has stated that his experiences mountaineering have also formed part of the inspiration for his game design work.

<doc id="36609578" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36609578" title="DRDO Netra">
DRDO Netra

The Netra is an Indian, light-weight, autonomous UAV for surveillance and reconnaissance operations. It has been jointly developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation's Research and Development Establishment (R&DE), and IdeaForge, a Mumbai-based private firm. The UAV was featured in the hit movie 3 Idiots.
Design and development.
The Netra is a lightweight UAV, constructed of carbon fiber composites, that uses quadcopters to provide lift and control giving a VTOL capability. It has no moving parts other than the rotors, motors and transmissions, and hence it requires very low maintenance. The use of carbon-fibre has resulted in a light weight of , which makes the Netra very portable. A backpack case allows operators to carry the system to field locations to serve as the base station. It also contains the power supply, military-grade controller, hand-held operator console and the communication systems.
Capabilities.
Netra can be launched from a small clearing, and it can fly up to a distance of 2.5 km from its take-off point. The operational altitude of the UAV is 200 m. With an on-board wireless transmitter, it can carry out surveillance in an area of 1.5 km Line of Sight (LOS) at the height of 300 m, for 30 minutes on a single battery charge. It has a high resolution CCD camera with a pan/tilt and zoom to facilitate wider surveillance and can also carry a thermal camera for night operations. The zoom-in camera can identify human activity up to 500 m away, and can send live video feed of objects within a radius of 5 km. The images are sent through a local wireless network to laptops for monitoring.
Flight and navigation is independent of user-input, and is controlled by an on-board auto-pilot with the help of anti-collision sensors. The user interface offers waypoint navigation, in which the user specifies the location of the target and the UAV automatically flies to that location. A built-in fail-safe allows it to return to base if there is loss of communication with the controller or if the battery is low in power. The UAV cannot yet operate in rain and further research is being done to make it operable in all weather conditions.
Trials.
10 prototypes were made during the development stage by DRDO and they were put under tests like the temperature tests (from -10°C to 55°C) and high-altitude tests. After the successful trials, the UAV was cleared for production and induction. The development stage has been completed and Ideaforge is responsible for the production. The company has manufacturing capacity of 10 units per month. The base price of the UAV is Rs1.5-2 million, which can increase on purchase of additional components like a thermal camera.
Further development.
Ideaforge is also working on a more advanced version of Netra, which will have an increased flight time from the present 30 minute per battery charge.
Operations.
Netra has done well in the Indian market, with several central and state armed police forces procuring it, and more police units interested in its capability. With the civilian use of UAVs gaining popularity in India, ideaForge has given about 200 demonstrations to prospective buyers. The drone is designed to be used in hostage situations, border infiltration monitoring, law enforcement operations, search and rescue operations, disaster management and aerial photography. It can also be used in naxal-affected districts, in border locations across India for surveillance, and for anti-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations in dense forested areas, where it can use its camera payloads to track human activity. It can also operate in urban quarters, in situations similar to that of the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
It was deployed by the local law enforcement during a political rally in Chandigarh. Gujarat Police purchased two systems at a unit price of 55 lakhs from IdeaForge. In July 2013 during the 136th Jagannath Rath Yatra, Ahmedabad became the first Indian city to use UAVs for crowd management. Three Netra UAVs were used in Uttarakhand by the NDRF for locating people during the 2013 North India floods. It was Netra's first deployment in a disaster rescue operation. They were used in Badrinath and Kedarnath, where real-time monitoring of their video feed helped locate hundreds of survivors with precision. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police also deployed the UAV on 24 June in remote locations like Kedarnath, Bhairav Chatti and Jungle Chatti to spot survivors.

Karl von Pflanzer-Baltin

Karl Freiherr von Pflanzer-Baltin (1 June 1855, Pécs, Hungary - 8 April 1925, Vienna) was an Austro-Hungarian general who was active in World War I.
Biography.
Pflanzer-Baltin became General of Cavalry from October 1912 and he served on the general staff, but in 1914 he was unattached, due to precarious health. It was only in the autumn of that year, when Romania appeared to be turning against the Central Powers, that he was charged with the defense of Transylvania. When the Russians crossed the Carpathians, and there was immediate danger of their eruption into the Hungarian plains, Pflanzer-Baltin, with an improvised division, threw himself on them, and conducted a defense with a series of offensive movements. He was promoted to Colonel-General in 1916. After fighting with varying success in the southern part of Eastern Galicia and in the Bukovina the VII Army under his command was driven back by Aleksei Brusilov's offensive in June 1916, whereupon he was relieved of his command.
Pflanzer-Baltin became General Inspector of the infantry in 1917 and subsequently Supreme Commander of Austro-Hungarian infantry in Albania.
In the summer of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian front in Albania yielded before the attack of the Entente army. Pflanzer-Baltin, entrusted with the command in this theatre of operations, won back, after a brief attack, the old positions south of Fjeri and Berat — the last notable success of the Austro-Hungarian Army in the field.

Crayke Castle

Crayke Castle is a grade I listed 15th-century castle in Crayke, North Yorkshire, England.
The castle consists of a restored 15th century four storey tower house with attached outbuildings to the rear and a separate ruined 15th tower, the "New Tower". It is situated on Church Hill in the village of Crayke.
History.
The present building was constructed around 1450 for Robert Neville, Bishop of Durham on land which had belonged to the See of Durham since Saxon times. Up to the time of James I the castle was surrounded by a deer park. During the Civil War the castle was slighted by the Parliamentarians and sold to Sir William Allanson, a former Mayor and MP of York. Allanson’s son Charles repaired and restored the main building to the condition it remains in to this day. Around 1667 the manor was restored to the See of Durham to be leased out as a farmhouse to various people until Bishop William van Mildert was allowed by Parliament to sell it into private hands in 1827. It was temporarily requisitioned as a Land Army barracks in the Second World War.

Two Opposites Reaching Up Toward the Peak of Progress

Two Opposites Reaching Up Toward the Peak of Progress is a public art work by American artist Thomas Queoff, located on the south side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The granite sculpture is an obelisk made of a narrow piece of red granite cut into a tapering hourglass form. At its base, the sculpture is approximately two feet wide. As the sculpture narrows by a foot toward its midsection, the granite's surface is faceted along a diagonal line. Toward the sculpture's again wider top, a trapezoidal void in the shape of an elongated diamond divides the granite and gives it the appearance of the eye of a needle. The artwork is located in the traffic median on S. Layton Blvd. between W. Greenfield Ave. and W. Orchard St.

<doc id="36609682" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36609682" title="Ernest Trumpp">
Ernest Trumpp

Ernest Trumpp (13 March 1828 - 1885) was a German philologist and missionary to Sindh Province, Punjab Province, and Peshawar—all part of then-British India before Partition of India.
He authored the first Sindhi grammar entitled "Sindhi Alphabet and Grammar". He also published "Grammar of Pashto, or language of the Afghans, compared with the Iranian and North Indian idioms", and translated most of the Guru Granth Sahib, sacred scriptures of the Sikhs, into English language.
Biography.
Trumpp was born on 13 March 1828 at Ilsfeld in Wurtemberg Province("now" Baden-Württemberg), Germany. He migrated to London due to political upheaval in his country, and he was employed as an assistant librarian at the East India House (later known as India Office), headquarters of British East India Company that governed British India until British government took control of the Company's possessions in 1858.
Around 1854, he arrived India as a missionary sponsored by the Ecclesiastical Mission Society to study Languages of India and prepare their grammars and glossaries for use by Christian missionaries. As part of missionary duties, he was initially stationed at Karachi mission station, where he learnt Sindhi language. Later, he was stationed at Peshawar, where he studied Pashto language. He went back to Germany in 1860, however, was summoned by India office to work with Sikh scriptures. He returned to Lahore, part of then-India, to translate the sacred books of Sikhs into English language.
He returned to Württemberg in 1871, and from 1874 worked as an professor of Oriental languages in Munich.
Bibliography.
While at Karachi, he translated Common Prayer Book into Persian language in 1858. In 1866, he edited and published Shah Jo Risalo, a poetic compendium of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, a Sindhi sufi; poet; mystic; and musician. He pubslished the first Sindhi grammar entitled "Sindhi Alphabet and Grammar" in 1872.
He published "Grammar of the Pushtoo, or language of the Afghans, compared with the Iranian and North Indian idioms" in 1873, and translated most of the sacred book of the Sikhs Adi Granth in 1870.
After he returned to Württemberg in 1876, he dedicated most of his labours in translation activity. By 1876, he translated Japji, So Purakh, Sohila, So Darh, Majh, the Ragas, Siri, Gauri and Asa, sloks of Kabir and Shaikh Farid, Savaiyyas of the Bhatts, and sloks of Guru Tegh Bahadur.
Sikh scriptures.
Robert Needham Cust, a British colonial administrator and linguist, suggested Court of Directors of the British East India Company on 12 August 1857 that India office in London should make arrangements for translation of Adi Granth into English language. Later, Robert Needham recommended Ernest Trumpp, who was Regius Professor of Oriental Languages at the University of Munich and member of Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences, to do the job of translation.
In 1869, Trumpp was summoned by India office to work in Punjab to translate the Sikh scriptures into English; accordingly, he stayed in Punjab for fifteen months and translated one-third of Adi Granth that was published in 1877. He translated Puratan and Bala Janamsakhis, the lives of the later gurus, including an account of their teachings. However, he concluded that Adi Granth was not worth translating in full--"the same few ideas, he thought, being endlessly repeated." Gilchrist also felt that the Dasam Granth was not worth translating at all, prompting criticism from devout Sikhs for the insult 
In the course of his research, it seems he had discovered the first known manuscript of the Puratan Janamsakhis(also spelt Janam-sakhi), the earliest known biography of Guru Nanak, at the India office Library, London. Trump found these manuscripts among the manuscripts forwarded to him from the India office's Library in 1872 with a note saying "in hope that some of them may be useful in the project entrusted to you."
He also penned some essays on "The Life of Nanak according to the Janam Sakhis", "Sketch of the Life of the other Sikh Gurus", "Sketch of the Religion of the Sikhs", "On the Composition of the Granth", and "On the Language and the Metres used in the Granth".

Maki Narumiya

Professional wrestling career.
Ice Ribbon (2011–present).
Former dancer and alum of Ochanomizu University, Narumiya began training for a career in professional wrestling under Emi Sakura. She made her debut on March 19, 2011, working for Sakura's Ice Ribbon promotion, losing to Mochi Miyagi. Just two days later Narumiya wrestled at her first major Ice Ribbon event, "Ice Ribbon March 2011", where she, Riho and Tamako faced Hikari Minami, Kurumi and Tsukushi in a six woman elimination tag team match. Narumiya was eliminated from the match by Minami, after which her team was defeated, when Tsukushi pinned Riho. On April 20, Narumiya picked up her first win on April 20, defeating Miyako Matsumoto. Narumiya then teamed with Matsumoto at her second major event, "Golden Ribbon 2011" on May 5, where the two defeated Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi, with Narumiya pinning Hoshi for the win. Narumiya's following months consisted mainly of losses, with her picking up her only wins against fellow newcomer Dorami Nagano. During June, Narumiya formed the N3 stable with Meari Naito and Neko Nitta, who debuted around the same time as her. N3 wrestled several matches together during the summer, but lost all of them, including three-on-one handicap matches against Hikaru Shida on June 8 and Tsukasa Fujimoto on June 15.
On December 3, Narumiya was defeated by Hikaru Shida in a singles match. Afterwards, the two began regularly teaming together, which led to Narumiya winning her first professional wrestling title, when, on December 28, she and Shida defeated Emi Sakura and Tsukushi for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. Narumiya and Shida made their first successful title defense on January 7, 2012, defeating the Lovely Butchers (Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi). The following day, Narumiya took part in Bull Nakano's retirement event, where she and Oz Academy's Akino faced JWP Joshi Puroresu's Kayoko Haruyama and Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling's Ryo Mizunami in a "Guillotine Drop match", based around all four using a variation of the leg drop as their finisher. Mizunami won the match for her team by pinning Narumiya. Back in Ice Ribbon, Narumiya and Shida made their second successful defense of the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship on January 25, by defeating Dorami Nagano and Hailey Hatred. Narumiya's and Shida's reign ended on February 5 at "Yokohama Ribbon", when they were defeated by Dropkickers (Tsukasa Fujimoto and Tsukushi). On February 12, Narumiya made her debut for Union Pro in a losing effort against Cherry. On March 20 at "Ice Ribbon March 2012", Narumiya teamed with "joshi" veteran Toshie Uematsu, in Uematsu's final Ice Ribbon appearance before her retirement, to defeat Hikari Minami and Riho in a tag team match. At the following major event, "Golden Ribbon 2012" on May 5, Narumiya entered the second annual Go! Go! Golden Mixed Tag Tournament, teaming with Osaka Pro Wrestling's Masamune. In their first round match, Narumiya and Masamune defeated the previous year's winning team, Makoto Oishi and Neko Nitta. After defeating Hikaru Sato and Riho in the semifinals, Narumiya and Masamune advanced to the finals, where they were defeated by Kurumi and Ribbon Takanashi.
On May 19, Narumiya scored an upset pinfall win over her former partner, the reigning ICE×60 Champion Hikaru Shida, in a tag team match, where she teamed with Aki Shizuku and Shida with Tsukasa Fujimoto. After a non-title match between the two on May 26 ended in a ten minute time limit draw, Narumiya was named the number one contender to the ICE×60 Championship, provided she could make the weight limit. Narumiya received her first shot at Ice Ribbon's top title on June 17 at the promotion's sixth anniversary event, but was unable dethrone Shida. On July 7, the N3 stable produced their first own Ice Ribbon event, which saw Narumiya defeat Meari Naito in the main event. As part of a working relationship between Ice Ribbon and JWP, Narumiya made her debut for JWP on July 8, losing to Hanako Nakamori. Afterwards, the two agreed to team up in the upcoming JRibbon Natsu Onna Kettei Tournament. This time the tournament, a JWP staple, was co-produced by JWP and Ice Ribbon, being split up into two "JRibbon" events on July 28; an Ice Ribbon event in the afternoon and a JWP event in the evening. During the Ice Ribbon event, Narumiya and Nakamori defeated Leon and Neko Nitta to advance to the JWP event, where they defeated Tsukasa Fujimoto and Rabbit Miu in their semifinal match. Later that same event, Narumiya and Nakamori defeated Arisa Nakajima and Hikaru Shida in the finals to win the 2012 Natsu Onna Kettei Tournament. After the match, Rabbit Miu, upset about being pinned by Narumiya in the semifinal match, entered the ring and offered her a shot at the JWP Junior and Princess of Pro-Wrestling Championships. Narumiya accepted the offer and the title match between the two was made official for August 19. On July 31, Narumiya made her debut for Dramatic Dream Team (DDT), taking part in an "Ice Ribbon offer match", where she and Tsukushi were defeated by Hikaru Shida and Neko Nitta. On August 7, Narumiya made her debut for Pro Wrestling Wave, once again pinning Rabbit Miu in a tag team match, where she teamed with Yuu Yamagata and Miu with Tsukasa Fujimoto. A week before their title match, Narumiya earned another pinfall victory over Miu in the main event of a JWP event, where she teamed with Kagetsu and Miu with JWP Openweight Champion Kayoko Haruyama. Later that same day, Narumiya joined Leon's Shishi no Ana stable, becoming a regular member of JWP's roster. On August 19, Narumiya was defeated by Miu in the match for the JWP Junior and Princess of Pro-Wrestling Championships. Back in Ice Ribbon later that same day, Narumiya teamed with Meari Naito to unsuccessfully challenge Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto for the Reina World Tag Team Championship.
Afterwards, Narumiya went on a seventeen match losing streak, before finally defeating Miyako Matsumoto on November 28, debuting her new finishing maneuver, the "Yuruneba", in the process. On December 8, Narumiya defeated Hikaru Shida and Tsukushi in a three-way match to become the number one contender to ICE×60 Champion Mio Shirai at Ice Ribbon's biggest event of the year, "RibbonMania 2012". At the event on December 31, Narumiya defeated Shirai to win the ICE×60 Championship for the first time. Narumiya wrestled her first match since her title win on January 5, 2013, pinning Hikaru Shida in a tag team main event, where she and Hamuko Hoshi faced Shida and Oz Academy representative Aja Kong. Following the match, Narumiya began complaining about severe neck pain and two days later Ice Ribbon announced that she had suffered a spinal cord injury and would be sidelined indefinitely. As a result of her injury, Narumiya vacated the ICE×60 Championship on January 12, ending her reign at just twelve days, the shortest reign in the title's history. Narumiya returned to Ice Ribbon on June 15, announcing that she had moved back to Tokyo from Kumamoto to start training for her upcoming return match. Narumiya wrestled her return match on August 25, losing to N3 stablemate Neko Nitta. She picked up her first win since her return on September 22 over Risa Sera. On October 6, Narumiya made her debut for Wrestle-1, losing to Akino in a singles match. Back in Ice Ribbon, Narumiya started a storyline rivalry with Mio Shirai, which built to a singles match on December 7, where Narumiya was victorious. Following the win, Narumiya was named the number one contender to the renamed and now weight limitless ICE×∞ Championship at "RibbonMania 2013". Prior to the match, Narumiya entered a storyline, where she was coaxed into giving up the guillotine leg drop finisher by the defending champion, Tsukasa Fujimoto, who claimed she could not defeat her without the move. Narumiya had earlier claimed that the move had caused her spinal cord injury a year earlier. On December 31, Narumiya failed in her title challenge against Fujimoto. During the match, Narumiya hit the guillotine leg drop, but in storyline hurt herself with it more than her opponent, leading to her losing the match.
On January 25, 2014, Narumiya and Risa Sera defeated Hamuko Hoshi and Tsukushi in the finals of a four-team tournament to become the number one contenders to the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. The team, now known as ".STAP", received its title shot on February 15, but was defeated by Muscle Venus (Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto). On March 30, after the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship had been vacated due to Hikaru Shida's resignation from Ice Ribbon, .STAP defeated Kurumi and Tsukushi in a decision match to become the new champions. On April 6, Narumiya made her debut for Wrestling New Classic (WNC), teaming with Makoto to defeat Kaho Kobayashi and Syuri in a tag team match. made their first successful title defense on May 6 against Narumiya's N3 stablemates Meari Naito and Neko Nitta. Four days later, N3 produced their second Ice Ribbon event, which also marked the stable's final appearance together before disbanding. On May 25, Narumiya made an appearance for Reina Joshi Puroresu, unsuccessfully challenging La Amapola for the CMLL-Reina International Championship. On June 7 at Ice Ribbon's eighth anniversary event, .STAP made their second successful title defense against the Lovely Butchers. Their third defense took place at a Reina Joshi Puroresu event on June 29, where they defeated Kaho Kobayashi and Makoto.

Pocket Planes

Pocket Planes is a business simulation video game developed by NimbleBit for iOS. It was initially released on June 14, 2012. In October 2012, the game became available on the Mac App Store. An Android version, ported and published by Mobage, was released on September 22, 2012.
Gameplay.
In "Pocket Planes", players assume the role of an airline CEO. Starting with a few airports and small planes, players transport small amounts of cargo and passengers short distances. As they slowly gain profit from their flights, they then build more airports, buy better planes, and expand their airline internationally. 
A formula determines how much profit will be earned from a flight, depending on the distance, speed and the weight of the plane used on the route. Filling a plane with items or people going to the same destination will net a 25% bonus on each item. Players can also complete events that involve flying special items and people to a designated destination. After completing these events, players are awarded Bux, which are used to buy planes and purchase other perks such as upgrades and the ability to speed up flights.
iOS.
"Pocket Planes" is integrated with Apple's social gaming network Game Center on iOS. The game features both leaderboards and achievements, and allows players to connect using the "Flight Crew" element of the game. In Flight Crew, groups of players compete against one another. The individual members of a group collectively perform "jobs" to earn prizes such as rare plane parts and additional Bux in competition.
Additionally, iCloud syncing is available for play from multiple iOS devices.
Android.
On Google's Android platform, Pocket Planes synchronises to the Mobage network, using a Mobage username.
Similarities to "Tiny Tower".
The game contain several similarities to NimbleBit's previous game "Tiny Tower". Both games feature an 8-bit-inspired graphic style and are populated by NPCs called "Bitizens". The currency is the same in both games as well. There are coins, which are the most common currency and easier to earn than bux. Bux are the premium currency, allowing players to purchase upgrades or speed up gameplay. 
Another feature the two games share is an in-game parody of Facebook called "Bitbook", where Bitizens write posts based on an action that the user has performed. For example, in "Pocket Planes", when a player sends a plane on a flight, usually if a Bitizen is riding that plane, they will write a (generally) humorous post about the flight.
Reception.
The game was well received by both players and critics. It was favorably reviewed by Gamezebo.com. The game is rated an average of 4.5/5 stars by users on the App Store. Ryan Rigney of "Wired"" "gave a mixed review, writing" "that "Your success in "Pocket Planes "is never dependent on your skills as a player," but noting, "I will admit "Pocket Planes" is addictive."

Somerton railway station

Somerton railway station (not to be confused with Fritwell & Somerton) was a small railway station situated on the Great Western Railway's Langport and Castle Cary Railway. It served the town of Somerton in Somerset, England.
History.
Somerton station opened to the public on 2 July 1906, in a cutting adjoining the town centre. The station had two signal boxes and a goods shed, however none of these are still standing. The station stopped handling passenger services on 10 September 1962 but continued to serve freight traffic until closing altogether on 6 July 1964. Despite all the stations between and being closed, the line remained open for trains from London Paddington station to stations such as , and .
In recent times there have been various aspirations to re-open the station by local people, including local MP David Heath - but until that may happen, the only real sign of the station today is a -long siding which had been built originally to let goods trains be overtaken. This siding is still used occasionally by Network Rail during night-time engineering works.
Description.
The station lay just behind the West Street girder bridge and ran all the way down to the Perry Hill area of the town. The main building was sited on the eastbound platform, with the goods shed at the west end of that platform. The original signal box was placed just opposite this platform, but a second signal box was opened in 1942 to control and monitor some new loop lines and sidings which created to the west of the station itself.
Various local businesses used the station as a site for their companies, with a cattle market, an animal and corn feed mill, a coal yard and even a fish merchant all having stood on the site.

Bukochosho

The ' ("Badge for Military Merit"), commonly called the ', was a military decoration of the Empire of Japan, established on 7 December 1944 by Imperial edict. It was awarded by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) to living soldiers who had performed with exceptional valor in battle. Airmen, especially fighter pilots defending Japan against enemy bombers, were most likely to win the award. Exactly 89 "Bukōshō" were awarded during the eight months it was active.
Background.
The Order of the Golden Kite had served for decades as an auspicious military award of the Japanese armed forces, and was the only Japanese Order that was solely awarded to the military (the Order of the Rising Sun and the Order of the Sacred Treasure could be awarded to either military or civilian recipients). However, the process by which Order of the Golden Kite was awarded was very lengthy: it was indeed awarded to military men who had died in service, while the remainder were normally awarded only "after" the end of a war, for services throughout the conflict. As the Second World War dragged on, it became apparent that there was a need to promote morale among active army units by rewarding acts of valor more readily. To this end the IJA suggested the "Bukōchōshō" as an alternate decoration for living recipients who had shown the highest valor in combat, to be awarded much more quickly by division commanders in the field. Emperor Hirohito established the award on 7 December 1944: the three-year anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor which signaled the start of the Pacific War.
Award.
The "Bukōshō" (as it was popularly known) was presented in two classes, called A and B, or First and Second. Loosely resembling the Iron Cross 1st Class, the "Bukōshō" was a pin back badge, cast in iron or steel, featuring two shields (in gilt for A-Class, bronzed for B-Class) forming a cross, with a gilt banner at the center bearing the two kanji characters "Bukō" (Military Merit). The reverse side (again in gilt for A-Class, bronzed for B-Class) bore the six kanji characters in two columns "Rikugun/Bukōchōshō" (Army/Badge for Military Merit). Both classes were the same size: high and wide.
The "Bukōshō" was allowed to be given retroactively to soldiers who had distinguished themselves in earlier battle as far back as 1941 or perhaps 1940. In practice, the award was given disproportionately to fighter pilots flying against the American Boeing B-29 Superfortresses bombing the Japanese homeland. The first three men to win the award were Toru Shinomiya, Masao Itagaki and Matsumi Nakano—pilots flying the Kawasaki Ki-61 "Hien" fighter known by the Allies as the "Tony". On 3 December 1944, the three men were successful in very risky aerial ramming attacks. Another pilot, Masao Itagaki, successfully rammed B-29s on two occasions to earn two "Bukōshō". Unusually, the IJA awarded the "Bukōshō" to at least one aviator of the Imperial Japanese Navy, given for valiant action in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, 19–20 June 1944.

The First Miracle of the Infant Jesus

The First Miracle of the Infant Jesus is a monologue by Dario Fo, recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature.
It was originally published in Italian language as "Il primo miracolo di Gesù Bambino" in 1977, together with "The Tale of a Tiger" della tigre, "Dedalo e Icaro" and Icarus and "Il sacrificio di Isacco" Sacrifice in the collection "Storia della tigre e altre storie" ["The tale of a Tiger and other Stories"].
The pre-Christmas 1987 performance of "The First Miracle of the Infant Jesus" on Italian television's variety-lottery show "Fantastico" led to further accusations of blasphemy from the Vatican; Fo portrayed the titular character deploying bolts of lightning to save other children from a bully.
The story of the Baby Jesus is told from an unusual point of view. The young child finds that he has the power to do miracles. When the other children refuse to play with him, he takes clay, breathes on it, and turns it into birds that fly. He is also tempted to turn bullies into pillars of stone.

Compass is a public art work by American artist Gail Simpson, located on the east side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The painted alumnium sculpture was commissioned by the Eastside Business Improvement District #20 to serve as a gateway for pedestrians and vehicular traffic entering the North Avenue commercial zone. A tall stainless steel light post salvaged from the demolition of Milwaukee's Park East Freeway is surrounded by a colorful array of painted aluminum signs that protrude in a spiral formation. Each sign has a distinctive shape and word cut out in a unique typeface intended to reflect the history and character of the neighborhood. The artwork is located in the traffic median on the east side of the North Avenue Bridge. "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel" architecture critic Whitney Gould called the project, "part sculpture, part signpost."

El emigrante (short story)

"El emigrante" (The migrant) is a flash fiction story by the Mexican writer Luis Felipe Lomelí, published in 2005. It is perhaps the best known example of the genre, at least in Spanish, and has been widely cited.
Origin.
The class of micronarrative or microfiction of which "El emigrante" is a famous example has precursors in the 1980s and 1990s with the work of Jacques Sternberg and Philippe Delerm, but perhaps has been brought back to life through the influence of Facebook and Twitter.
The author explains that the story came from the little sign he kept seeing when leaving buses or airplanes, saying "¿Olvida usted algo?" (Did you forget anything). That made him think of all the things he would like to remember but could not, and the other things he would prefer to forget. Thinking of these things became a private game for him, whenever he saw the sign. He was given a grant by the Mexican Foundation for Literature that included obligatory attendance at a workshop on micro-stories and, without thinking much, wrote the story down. He added "¡Ojalá!" (If only!) to the text of the sign to create the story. Later, when taking his book of short stories to the publisher, it struck him that the micro-story summarized all the others, so he added it at the beginning. He had no idea it would become so widely known. In fact, it had already been submitted to a magazine and rejected.
Publication and reception.
"El emigrante" appeared in Lomelí's second book, "Ella sigue de viaje", published in March 2005.
The story may be seen as a summary of the feelings of the characters in the other stories in the book,
whether they have left behind love, loneliness or violence.
Another story in this book won the "Edmundo Valadés" Latin American Short Story Prize.
The book itself won the prestigious San Luis Potosí national short story award.
"El emigrante", and others in the microfiction genre such as the classic work by the Guatemalan writer Augusto Monterroso "Cuando despertó, el dinosaurio todavía estaba allí" (When (s)he woke, the dinosaur was still there) present questions that provoke thought and intellectual development.
"El emigrante" has become one of the most celebrated and frequently cited of microfiction stories.
It is considered the shortest story in the Spanish language.
"El emigrante" brought widespread recognition to the author, who has since moved on to writing a full-length novel, at the opposite end of the extreme.
The story inspired "¿Olvida usted algo? – ¡Ojalá!", an installation by the artist Susana Rodríguez, which opened in August 2009 at the Casa del Lago in Mexico City. Rodríguez's work explores the idea of a building that perhaps has been destroyed during a storm, but where traces remain of the time when it was inhabited.
The outdoor installation is constructed of bricks, concrete, ceramic tiles and a wooden door. 
The work is ambiguous, leaving it to the viewer to interpret whether the building was destroyed, is in the process of being built, or is complete.
The artist has said she addresses the dialectic between construction and destruction as an event that helps us understand and accept the transformation of life as inevitable.

Mistero Buffo

Mistero buffo ("Comical Mystery") is Dario Fo's solo "pièce célèbre", performed across Europe, Canada and Latin America from 1969 to 1999. It is recognised as one of the most controversial and popular spectacles in postwar European theatre and its broadcast in Italy prompted the Vatican to denounce it as "the most blasphemous show in the history of television".
The performance is a series of small one-act plays built around the idea of the travelling players of medieval times, who would travel to towns and villages, bringing the latest news, Fo also performs theatrical pieces which are sometimes subversive in their content. The final section of the collection consists of Passion Plays narrating the life and times of Christ.
Fo's work originates in the surviving texts and descriptions of the "giullari". The title of the piece is borrowed from "Mystery-Bouffe" by Vladimir Mayakovsky. An authorised English translation has been carried out by Ed Emery.

Hollywood to Dollywood

Hollywood to Dollywood is an American documentary film that played at 60 film festivals in the U.S., Canada, Scotland, and Australia in 2011 and 2012. Directed by John Lavin, the film follows the cross-country journey of identical twins Gary and Larry Lane to deliver to Dolly Parton a screenplay they wrote, which includes a role for her. "Hollywood to Dollywood" has won 24 film festival awards and includes 17 Parton songs, two of which were previously unreleased. The film had a one-week theatrical release in New York beginning August 31, 2012, followed a week later in Los Angeles.
Synopsis.
Twin brothers Gary and Larry Lane, originally from Goldsboro, N.C., have written a screenplay entitled "Full Circle" with a role specifically for their idol, Dolly Parton. Unsuccessful in their efforts to bring the screenplay to the singer-actress’s attention, the brothers travel in an RV from Los Angeles, where they reside, to Dollywood, Parton’s theme park in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Their plan is to hand the screenplay to Parton, whom they had met a few times briefly, at one of her scheduled appearances during Dollywood’s 25th anniversary celebration.
"Hollywood to Dollywood" follows the brothers’ travels in the RV they nicknamed Jolene, after one of Parton’s hit songs. Also on board Jolene as the main driver is Michael Bowen, Gary Lane’s partner. Bowen hopes to present Parton with a birdhouse he handcrafted, a replica of her Tennessee home. During the five-day journey of 2,200 miles along Interstate 40, the Lanes revise their screenplay, endure a tornado, meet everyday Americans, and talk about their experiences growing up gay in North Carolina. The 2010 Nashville flood nearly derails their plans to get to Dollywood in time to meet Parton. The documentary also explores the Lane twins’ concerns about their Southern hometown’s potential reaction to the film (and to the brothers’ homosexuality) and their desire for acceptance from their Southern Baptist mother.
"Hollywood to Dollywood" includes appearances from several of the Lane twins’ friends, including actors Leslie Jordan, Chad Allen, Beth Grant and Ann Walker and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dustin Lance Black.
Parton’s involvement.
After viewing the film, Parton granted the Lane twins the use of some of her songs for the film as well as the DVD and Blu-ray versions. Parton’s music, including hits such as "I Will Always Love You", "Coat of Many Colors", and "Jolene" and two previously unreleased songs "Celebrate the Dreamer in You" and "The Sky is Not the Limit", serve as a backdrop throughout the film. The brothers helped pay for the rights to Parton’s music with prize money earned on the reality TV program "Wipeout".
Parton also gave permission to use her likeness in the film’s poster and in the film's promotion. She gave the filmmakers footage shot at Dollywood and during the opening of her Trinkets and Treasures store in Nashville. Parton appears in the film as well, in news clips and in footage shot for the documentary.
During a press conference Parton said she appreciated that she was "an inspiration (to the Lanes) and someone they kind of leaned on." She said she was "proud" to be a part of their documentary.
The Lane twins donate 10 percent of each DVD and Blu-ray sale to the Imagination Library, an organization administered by Parton’s Dollywood Foundation. The Imagination Library provides free books each month to young children enrolled in the program.
Accolades.
The Lanes submitted their film to festivals whose timing would coincide with Parton’s tour dates. During 2011 and 2012, "Hollywood to Dollywood" played at 60 film festivals in the U.S., Canada, Scotland, and Australia.
"The New York Times" review of the film said, "The optimism and good humor of John Lavin’s crude, endearing documentary...are so unquenchable that its disturbing underlying theme — growing up gay in the South is no picnic — is partly obscured by its openheartedness." "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote: ""Hollywood to Dollywood" overcomes its thematic limitations with an endearing, casual charm that only the most curmudgeonly could fully resist." "The Village Voice" said the film is "as much a road movie as it is a subtle screed on civil rights." On her TV program, Rosie O'Donnell called "Hollywood to Dollywood" “a beautiful movie.” In a review on the website AfterElton.com, Brent Hartinger wrote that “the movie's terrific — a true crowd-pleaser all the way.“ Hartinger added that “easily the most interesting thing about the movie is its look at American Southern culture, particularly as it applies to gays.” The blog DVDTalk said the film is "thoroughly enjoyable," "a hybrid of carefree road trip and probing examination of the Southern American LGBT community."
"Hollywood to Dollywood" has won 24 film festivals awards including Best Documentary, Audience Favorite at the Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival (2012); Best Documentary, NYC Downtown Feature Film Festival (2012); Audience Choice Award, Best Documentary, Out on Film Festival, Atlanta (2012); and two awards at the 8th Annual ReelHeART International Film Festival in Toronto (2011), including the prestigious 'Founder's Award (Best of the Fest) and First Place, Feature Documentary Award.

National Outline Plan

A national outline plan (, "Tokhnit Mit'ar Artzit", abbr. תמ"א, "Tama") refers to a zoning and development statutory plan in a specific field on a national level in Israel. A national outline plan is meant to affect the entire country and influences planning on the regional and local levels. In general, each national plan is augmented by more local plans that discuss its implementation in more detail. National outline plans are drafted by the National Planning and Construction Committee or the National Infrastructure Committee, and approved by the government of Israel.
The first national outline plan, created by architect Aryeh Sharon, was approved in 1951, and dealt with settling the Negev and Galilee regions. However, this plan was never implemented. The first national plan to be put to practical use was National Outline Plan 3, approved in 1976, dealing with road infrastructure in the country.
Future.
As of 2013, there is a plan to merge all National Outline Plans, except Plan 35, to one master plan.

La Dolce Viva

“La Dolce Viva” is a nonfiction novel written by Barbara L. Goldsmith, first published in 1968 in the New York magazine, about a destroyed one-named actress, Viva, who is drugged out and couldn’t pay her phone bill.
Barbara Goldsmith is an American author, journalist, and philanthropist. Goldsmith’s “La Dolce Viva,” which made known to others the sad side of Andy Warhol’s entourage through Viva, a high on drugs “superstar.” Most of Goldsmith’s pieces were about characters like Audrey Hepburn – little miss perfect. And Viva, was someone who was characterized as a dependent, promiscuous, dirty untidy messed up woman. For New Journalist Goldsmith, this emerging genre, New Journalism, inspired her to write about cultural changes conveyed through issues, events, and people of the 1960s.
Summary.
"La Dolce Viva" is an interview story with "superstar" Viva, who is one of the many actresses in Andy Warhol's movies. Yet Viva, was headlined as 'The Last of Andy Warhol's "superstars".' Warhol would simply film them, and declare them "superstars". Along with being an actresses, Viva is a model who influences the fashion trends of the time. Viva's modeling and acting career was launched with the help of Andy Warhol and his many friends. Being in Andy Warhol's inner circle made Viva the perfect character for this interview. Viva grew up in a very Catholic home surrounded by figures of the Virgin Mary, Bibles, and pictures of First Communion. At home, religious values were imposed upon Viva from her family. Viva lived with the nuns until she was twenty years old. Once Viva turned twenty, she left the religious ways of her family and the Catholic Church and she started to explore what is now her derogatory lifestyle of sleeping around with multiple partners. The book details Viva's experience with sex, drug, and love in Warhol's factory. Along with sleeping with a different guy almost every night, Viva also was turned on to drugs by Timothy Leary. Viva started doing drugs out of curiosity but quickly became addicted and could not stop. The environment of Andy Warhol and his inner circle did not help her addiction to these drugs due to the fact that everyone else was using them as well. Once Viva became tired of drugs and sex, she decided to return home to her parents and asked to be put into a mental institution. Once viva say the institution, she became scared and begged her mother to take her home. When Viva returned home, she realized that she missed the lifestyle that she had with Andy Warhol and decided to go back to New York with her sister. Viva started out back in New York with her sister but that quickly ended when she realized her dependency upon Andy Warhol and she decided to leave her sister and move back into Andy Warhol's inner circle. Her promiscuous ways and drug use led Viva to become very dependent upon men. Even though in the interview Viva tries to portray herself as an independent woman, she greatly depends on Andy Warhol to not only help pay her rent and electricity bill but to help her keep up with her lifestyle of drug use and fitting in with the crowd. Having to have Andy Warhol pay for everything Viva needed clearly shows just how dependent she was on someone else.
Tone.
In "La Dolce Viva" the tone is very honest, shocking, and nonchalant. Viva's honesty is shocking because of the topic she is discussing, which just so happens to be about her messed up lifetime through the ups and downs of many battling years. Her lifestyle, especially her promiscuity, was not accepted in this period in time. Throughout Goldsmith's representation of tone and mood, it is somewhat negative as they scrimmage through her apartment junk, talk about her rough life, and the need for sex and drugs.
Setting.
"La Dolce Viva" takes place mostly in Andy Warhol's new loft studio which has been named 'The Factory' -Andy Warhol and his famous factory full of helpers and hangers-on. Some parts of the interview also takes place in Viva's East 83rd Street brownstone floor-through apartment which is scattered with the mixture of clean and dirty clothes, underwear, dishes in the sink, food on the counter and stacks of old magazines and papers. Along with Andy Warhol's apartment and Viva's apartment, "La Dolce Viva" also takes place in Max's Kansas City which was a restaurant in which the models, actresses, and Warhol were treated like celebrities.
Characterization.
Viva's character is introduced to readers as an actress in Andy Warhol's movies and later, readers find out that she is a model who influences the fashion industry. Goldsmith uses questions that lead to showing Viva's promiscuous side and her dependency on a male figure. Viva is quoted saying "I slept with him for security reasons" during the interview and Goldsmith included this quote because it showed Viva's constant need for a man. Her disorganization and unreliability contributed to the end of her modeling aspirations. Describing Viva's messy apartment and how the dust filled your nose as you walked in and you could hardly see through the filthy windows, helps readers see how Viva lived a cluttered and messy lifestyle. The way that Viva presented herself during the interview with an outfit that did not match and hair that looked unwashed for days showed just how little she cared about her appearance.
Effects and Criticism.
“La Dolce Viva” was a piece that revealed the seedily side of Andy Warhol’s entourage through Viva. “I had never seen anything like it,” Tom Wolfe wrote of accompanying nude photos from Diane Arbus. According to contemporary New York Times review of the book, “La Dolce Viva” gave an insight to Warhol’s relationship to other people. But the articles appearance in the New York nearly ended Clary Felker’s magazine. (The Nude Photos that Nearly Destroyed New York) New York’s editor, Clay Felker, was well aware of the commercial risk he ran in publishing the piece… Felker went ahead and ran it. Reviewers of the work were generally hesitant to read this piece, but once they started reading they couldn’t put it down, and claimed it was a dynamite piece.
Cultural Impact.
Goldsmith’s seamy tale of aberrant sexual practice, drug addiction, and mental stability alone impacted society with Warhol’s “superstar” Viva as a wild, promiscuous girl. “Sex, drugs, rock ‘n’ roll and… drugs” could have easily been the slogan for the 1960s. Through Viva’s nude photos, racy past, and addiction to drugs and alcohol – society was impacted, yet this wasn’t anything new since the 1960s was already known for this absurd behavior. “La Dolce Viva” influenced the nudity of history and transformed American society.

Boyce–Sneed Feud

The Boyce–Sneed Feud was a conflict in early twentieth century Texas between two wealthy cattlemen: John Beal Sneed and Albert Boyce, Jr. It began in late 1911, when Mrs. Lena Snyder Sneed left her husband, John, for a relationship with Boyce. Sneed sought revenge for the sake of his honor and his home, which resulted in the deaths of eight men in less than one year.
Background.
The Sneeds were a wealthy family of cattle ranchers who lived in the Fort Worth, Texas, area. By 1911, the Sneeds had been married for over ten years and had two daughters.
In October 1911, after his wife informed him that she had been involved in a relationship with Boyce and wanted a divorce, Sneed had her placed in an asylum. (A diagnosis of "moral insanity" was a common practice for adulterous women at the time.) However, in the month following her incarceration, Boyce "rescued" her, and the two fled to Winnipeg, Canada.
Sneed's response to his wife's "kidnapping" by Boyce triggered a "bizarre series of events that symbolized the tenacity of frontier justice in west Texas in the early twentieth century." Initially, Sneed informed the police and succeeded in having Boyce and Mrs. Sneed arrested. She was released into the custody of her father, Tom Snyder, who owned a ranch in New Mexico Territory, but she later returned to Fort Worth to be with her husband. Sneed hoped to see Boyce sent to prison on charges of kidnapping. However, after the charges were dropped, he decided to take the law into his own hands.
The feud.
The first death in the conflict occurred on January 13, 1912, when Sneed killed Albert Boyce, Sr., who was a banker and a former manager of the XIT Ranch. Boyce was unarmed, and Sneed shot him in the back while they were standing inside the lobby of Fort Worth's Metropolitan Hotel. During the ensuing trial, Sneed alleged that Boyce, Sr. had assisted his son in "breaking up home." The trial was sensationalized by newspapers as "the greatest legal battle ever fought in Texas Courts."
Sneed's well-paid legal team managed to secure a mistrial. After the mistrial was announced, an angry mob attacked the courthouse, but was repulsed. An article written by Thomas H. Thompson for "The New Handbook of Texas" states: "Four men were killed outside the courthouse, and women fought with hatpins in the courthouse halls and even in the courtroom."
On March 6, 1912, Sneed's father, Joseph, was shot in the back and killed by a tenant farmer, R. O. Hillard, as he was walking down a street in Georgetown, Texas. According to Bartee Haile, a Texas historian, immediately after shooting the elder Sneed, Hillard committed suicide. In his pocket was found a letter that said; "My mind has failed me. J.T. Sneed is the cause of it. I am going to take revenge this way and then go to the asylum."
Sneed thought the Boyce family had something to do with his father's death. When Boyce, Jr. returned to Amarillo, Texas later that year, Sneed was waiting in disguise. On September 14, 1912, Sneed attacked Boyce in front of the Polk Street Methodist Church, shooting him three times with a shotgun. Boyce was killed before he could defend himself. Sneed then walked to the courthouse and surrendered to the Potter County sheriff. One of the witnesses who watched as Sneed surrendered was the young school teacher Georgia O'Keeffe.
On the day after Boyce's death, friends and relatives of both factions began assembling in Amarillo. It seemed as though more bloodshed would ensue, but the would be combatants dispersed after Sneed posted bail.
Sneed was retried for killing Boyce, Sr. before also being tried for killing the latter's son. He was acquitted both times, with the juries declaring the shootings justifiable homicides. Sneed became somewhat of a folk hero among Texans, but newspaper reporters from outside of the state regarded the shootings as cold-blooded murder. When reporters demanded a reason for the acquittal in the murder of Al Boyce, Jr., the jury foreman, James D. Crane, responded by saying; "The best answer is because this is Texas. We believe in Texas a man has the right and the obligation to safeguard the honor of his home, even if he must kill the person responsible."
Aftermath.
After the trials, the Sneeds moved to Paducah, Texas, where they owned a ranch and a cotton farm. Mr. Sneed was also involved in land speculation. In October 1922, he was found guilty in a federal court of having bribed a juror who had been involved in one of his land deals. Sneed was sentenced to two years at Leavenworth, Kansas, by Judge James C. Wilson.
While in prison, Sneed's son-in-law, Wood Barton, was killed by a grocer, C. B. Berry, over a $28 debt. Although arrested, Berry was eventually acquitted. After Sneed was released from prison, he sought revenge for his daughter. During two separate encounters in the streets of Paducah, separated by several months, Sneed and Berry shot each other numerous times. None of the wounds were fatal, though. In early 1924, in yet another instance of frontier justice, both men were acquitted of having shot the other.
Having worn out their welcome in Paducah, the Sneeds moved to Dallas and invested in an oilfield. They remained there for the next thirty years. Sneed died of cancer on April 22, 1960, and his wife six years later, on March 6, 1966. They are interred side-by-side at Hillcrest Cemetery in Dallas.

The Devil with Boobs

The Devil with Boobs (Italian title: "Il diavolo con le zinne") is a two-act play by Dario Fo, recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature.
First produced at Messina's Teatro Vittorio Emmanuele on 7 August 1997 (directed by Dario Fo), an English production occurred at the National Theatre Youth project in Summer 1999.
Described by Fo as "a Machiavellian comedy, a gigantic late sixteenth-century intrigue, with judges and devils, housekeepers possessed by devils, hermits, gendarmes, torturers and even a monkey", it featured an homage to his long-time collaborator Fiorenzo Carpi who had died earlier that year (1997).
Plot summary.
As described by Cappa and Nepoli, 'Alfonso Ferdinando de Tristano, an incorruptible, progressive magistrate (who disapproves of torture as an instrument of persuasion) investigates an arson in the cathedral. Unhappy about being subjected to his investigation, the prominent citizens of the town launch a campaign to discredit him, employing a couple of devils. One of them is instructed to enter the magistrate's body "through the most suitable orifice, the anus," transforming him into a rogue, a debauchee, a hypocrite and a black marketeer. Due to a misunderstanding, the devil Barlocca enters the body of Pizzocca Gannàssa, Alfonso's elderly and ungainly housekeeper, who is transformed into a delectable, busty lady (the 'boobs' of the title). Led astray by this beauty, the magistrate is dragged into court, but the she-devil allows him to be acquitted. Nonetheless he is condemned to become a galley slave in a subsequent trial.'

Don't Fail Me Now

"Don't Fail Me Now" is a song by American recording artist Melanie Amaro, the winner of the first season of "The X Factor", set to be included on her debut studio album under the label Epic Records. Written by Livvi Franc and produced by Rodney Jerkins, the upbeat pop song features the singer talking about self empowerment and finding a true love. It was first made available for stream on July 31, 2012, and it was released to digital download on September 18, 2012 as Amaro's debut single along with the b-side song "Love Me Now". It received mixed reviews from music critics, who praised the vocal performance, but criticized the use of Auto-Tune. As of December 2012 "Don't Fail Me Now" has sold 20,000 copies in the United States, failing to chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100 but peaking in the top-ten of the Hot Dance Club Songs chart.
Background and composition.
"Don't Fail Me Now" was written by Livvi Franc and produced by Rodney Jerkins, and is the first song from her upcoming debut studio album on Epic Records. In an interview with "Billboard", Amaro spoke that she "look for songs that are connected to real life scenarios -- love songs, breakups, getting hurt, finding the strength to keep on pushing in life." Described as "an uplifting account of Amaro's road to success", the upbeat pop track features the singer talking about self empowerment and finding a true love, which is perceived in lyrics such as "I've paid my dues, I've paid the price, I've prayed for you almost every night...I've walked the longest road so don't fail me now, feet don't fail me now." "Don't Fail Me Now" was made available to stream through her official SoundCloud account on July 31, 2012, and had been played over 175,000 times, as of 31 October 2012. The song was made available to other media outlets the following day. Amaro's manager Simon Cowell also released the single on TwitMusic, a service which lets users discover and share music uploaded by artists, also on August 1. After a week, "Don't Fail Me Now" garnered over 6,500 plays on the platform, making her one of the more popular singers there. The track was released on digital download on September 18, 2012.
Reception.
"Don't Fail Me Now" received mixed reviews from music critics. Gerrick Kennedy of "Los Angeles Times" gave the song a mixed review, saying Amaro's vocal performance and delivery was "flawless," but called the production and dance style "a complete misfire for a debut - especially when listeners haven't seen or heard Amaro since January and other finalists have already made splashes." He also criticized the lyrics, called them "bland" and "couldn't be interpreted as inspirational or romantic, depending on the listener." "Entertainment Weekly" contributor Grady Smith called it "a mismash, featuring a thumping club beat, soaring diva notes (some of which sound seemingly and unnecessarily Auto-Tuned), techno flourishes, and a bevvy of inspirational-slash-romantic lyrics. All of it leaves me a little confused - is she singing about her man, or The Man Upstairs?" Scott Shetler of Pop Crush rated it two and a half stars out of five, saying, "unfortunately, her first offering offers a rather bland dance-pop arrangement that doesn't flaunt her winning voice effectively." Idolator writer Becky Bain gave the song a negative review, explaining that the track lacked originality, exemplifying the use of "a techno breakdown thrown in for absolutely no reason other than to poorly follow the current trend. It also doesn't seem to know whether it's a love song or a self-empowerment anthem." Since its release, "Don't Fail Me Now" reached a peak of number 21 on "Billboard"s Hot Dance Club Songs component chart.
Promotion.
Music video.
An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Benny Boom, who wanted to showcase Amaro's vision of the track. He explained, "When I first heard the song, I knew I wanted the video to have movement to it and be a journey. I thought of a clever way of taking her on this journey by using a rear-screen projector. She’s no longer the ‘X Factor’ contestant, she is the winner, and I wanted to make sure that we made a video that showed that." On October 19, 2012 Amaro premiered the music video for "Don't Fail Me Now" on her official VEVO account. The video features Amaro sitting at the park as her lover meets her and they go for a walk. As the story goes, she makes her way to a party with her friends, until her love interest meets her again and they dance to the track. The story intercuts with scenes of Amaro singing to the track stage with bright lights behind her. Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo commented that the music video "is actually not a fail" and added, "the ombre hair! The flamingo-pink lip lacquer! The curves! The cat-eyes! The giant hoop earrings! The signs of an actual personality! Melanie is working it here, and it all sort of works. The video is even making me like the single a little bit more, which is a good (and unexpected) thing."
In popular culture.

École militaire interarmes

The "Combined Arms School" or "Joint military school", known as École Militaire Interarmes or EMIA, is a military school of the French Army intended to form reserve officers and non-commissioned officers who had raised through the ranks as commissioned officers. It was founded in 1942 and based in Coëtquidan (Morbihan) along with Saint-Cyr military school.
History.
The EMIA is the heiress of the various branch schools of the 19th century that were forming officers from corps of troops. The most important of these branch schools, the infantry school of Saint-Maixent was merged with Saint-Cyr in 1942 in the school student aspiring Cherchell-Mediouna, created after the German occupation of southern zone. In 1944 the Military Academy Cherchell took the name of "Joint Military Academy." She moved to Coëtquidan buildings of the old school of Saint-Cyr, Saint-Cyr-School were destroyed in the bombing. The new school, which in 1947 took the name of "Joint Special Military School", formed at the same time, according to the idea of amalgamation of its founder, General de Lattre de Tassigny, officers from external competition and Officers from the internal recruitment. This system works until 1961, when they separated the training of officers "direct" transferred to the new school of Saint-Cyr, and that officers "semi-direct" entrusted to EMIA.
Recruitment.
In the past, candidates were selected at the "Ecole Militaire of Strasbourg". The EMS consisted of two branches: the battalion of unique contest Services (CUS) and the pre-competition pack EMIA (PPEMIA). EMS students also had the opportunity to attend a competition for engineers auxiliary armament.
Traditions.
EMIA students are nicknamed "dolos" after the brand of corned beef of old combat rations. During the ceremonies, they wear the dress parade, called "TP" and the curved sword cavalry. In the tradition of activities they carry the blue cap, inherited from the Cadet "School Cherchell.
The songs are EMIA tradition Prayer and Sarie Marès.
A popular phrase:
"One day Dolo, Dolo forever! '

Cossutianus Capito

Cossutianus Capito (fl. 1st century AD) was a Roman politician.
Life.
Tacitus mentions Cossutianus Capito as a member of the Senate in AD 47. Later he became the governor of Cilicia.
Excerpts.
The Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire provides the following information about Cossutianus Capito:
"Famed for his role as an accuser during the reign of Nero, Capito served in Cilicia and earned the enmity of the local populace by shamefully extorting them. Prose-cuted for this crime, he returned to Rome and began to accuse others. His first victim was the praetor, Antistius, who was accused in 62 of treason for reading a libelous verse against Nero at a banquet."

Altenberg Publishing

Altenberg Publishing () was a Polish publishing house active from 1880 until 1934; first, in the partitioned and later in sovereign Poland. It specialized in publishing high-quality book prints and illustrated albums.
History.
The Altenberg Publishing was founded by Herman Altenberg, born in 1848. Altenberg, together with Maurice Robitschki led the Warsaw bookstore with small painting gallery in the years 1872–1879. They were the first in Poland to sell color reproductions of paintings. Altenberg moved to Lwów (now Lviv) in 1880, where he purchased the bookstore with a book rental. The same year, he commissioned painter Michał Elwiro Andriolli to produce a series of illustrations for his edition of Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz. The epic poem by Mickiewicz was originally published by Altenberg in monthly brochures and then published in full in 1882 (second edition in a smaller format was adopted in 1921). He had designed the book as a refined album with vignettes and 24 full-page illustrations, including ornamental initials and interludes – which brought the number of illustrations to a total of 58 drawings.
Although exclusively released as Altenberg's limited edition, prints by Andriolli have not been well received by the critics due to preconceived notions about the poem itself. Herman Altenberg besides other classics of Polish literature published also the "Fables" ("Bajeczki") by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski with illustrations by Andriolli, as well as "Mohorta" by Wincenty Pol with illustrations by Juliusz Kossak. Altenberg was the initiator of a new series called the Polish Classics Library (1882–1909) in which Jan Kochanowski and Stanisław Trembecki were published, and, the Amateur Theatres Library series. He first introduced in Galicia the system of selling books through agents.
After Herman Altenberg's death in 1885 the company was successfully run by his wife, Zuzanna (Susan) née Eber (1851–1921) together with Władysław Bałz. They had published such classics as the "Songs of the Legions" by Józef Wybicki (author of Poland's national anthem) with illustrations by Kossak as well as "Ballady i romanse" ("Ballads and Romances") collection of widely popular poems by Mickiewicz edited by Ludwik Finkel with illustrations by Andriolli. In 1894, they released the actual illustrated catalog of the books published by Altenberg Publishing for the purpose of sales and promotion. In 1896, the Altenberg Publishing issued a poetic drama "Dziady" by Mickiewicz, considered one of the great works of European Romanticism. It was the first deluxe edition of "Dziady" ("Forefathers' Eve") illustrated with engravings by Czesław Borys Jankowski, and edited by Wilhelm Bruchnalski.
Within a few years, the Altenberg Publishing run by Zuzanna, received a license to operate bookstores in several different cities including Krynica, Brody, Drohobycz, Jarosław, Rawa Ruska, and Sambor. Zuzanna Altenberg led the company until 1897, when her son Alfred took over the family business.
Family ownership.
In 1897 the company was taken over by Alfred Altenberg (born in 1877), the son of Herman Altenberg. Aside from the fine art reproductions, it published books on art and literature including K. Chłędowski, P. Chmielowski, and W. Feldman. As part of a new series of great writers, Alfred Altenberg published also the collections of works by Jan Kasprowicz, Maria Konopnicka, Juliusz Słowacki and more poetry by Mickiewicz. The new series included the Historical Library, the Library of Drama, and the popular-science "Wiedza i Życie". The periodicals included "Lamus" and satirical "Szczutka" weekly. Many publications were fitted with high quality hard covers, best paper, carefully selected fonts, formats and illustrations.
In 1907 the company was inherited by Alfred's brother, Maurycy Altenberg who was unable to maintain it. It was saved from bancruptcy in 1912 by the eminent Polish historian and geographer Jan Pawlikowski helped by his own father and a group of concerned publishers, who set it up as a joint venture. In the years 1911–1913 the company was transformed into the "H. Altenberg, Seyfarth G, E, Wende & Co." It went on to publish the "Księga ubogich" (Book of the Impoverished) by Jan Kasprowicz and the "Polish Portraits of the 16th to the 19th centuries" ("Portrety polskie") by Maryia Radziwiłł, edited by Jerzy Mycielski. The company also published the "Grześ" magazine for children. In 1920 the publishing house sold its bookstore. Soon later, it published (for the first time in full) the epic poem "Król Duch" ("The Spirit King") by Juliusz Słowacki among other things.
After Alfred's death in 1924, the company was run by his wife Jadwiga for the next decade. In 1934 the Altenberg Publishing was liquidated.

Fusiliers' Arch

Fusiliers' Arch is a monument which forms part of the Grafton Street entrance to St Stephen's Green park, in Dublin, Ireland. Erected in 1907, it was dedicated to the officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who fought and died in the Second Boer War (1899-1902).
Construction.
Funded by public subscription, the arch was designed by John Howard Pentland and built by Henry Laverty and Sons. Thomas Drew consulted on the design and construction.
The dimensions of the structure are said to be modelled on the Arch of Titus in Rome, and it is wide and high. The internal dimensions of the arch are 5.6 m high by 3.7 m wide (18 by 12 ft).
The main structure of the arch is granite, with the inscriptions carried out in limestone, and a bronze adornment on the front of the arch.
Dedication and controversy.
The arch was commissioned to commemorate the four battalions (two regular and two militia) of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers that served in the Second Boer war. It lists the principal battles and locations at which the fusiliers fought: Hart's Hill, Ladysmith, Talana, Colenso, Tugela Heights, and Laing's Nek. The names of 212 dead are inscribed on the underside of the arch.
The construction of the arch coincided with a time of political and social change in Ireland, and the colonial and imperial background to the dedication were anthema to a burgeoning nationalist movement - who labelled the structure "Traitor's Gate". Though damaged in a cross-fire between the Irish Citizens Army and British troops during the 1916 Easter Rising, the arch remains ""one of the few colonialist monuments in Dublin not blown up"" in Ireland's post-independence history.

TCP Fast Open

In computer networking, TCP Fast Open (TFO) is an extension to speed up the opening of successive Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections between two endpoints.
Details.
It works by using a "TFO cookie" (a TCP option) in the initial SYN packet to authenticate a previously connected client. If successful, it may start sending data to the client before the receipt of the final ACK packet of the three way handshake is received, skipping a round trip and lowering the latency in the start of transmission of data. This cryptographic cookie is stored on the client side and is set upon the initial connection. It is then repeated back whenever the client reconnects.
The cookie is generated by applying a block cipher keyed on a key held secret by the server to the client's IP address, generating a MAC tag that cannot be forged.
The proposal was originally presented in 2011
and is, , an IETF Internet draft.
Implementations.
TFO support was added to the Linux kernel between versions 3.6 and 3.7 and was turned on by default in 3.13.
Google Chrome and Chromium browsers have support, which is disabled by default, on Linux, Chrome OS, and Android operating systems.
Alternatives.
TCP Fast Open is similar to an earlier proposal from 1994, called T/TCP (RFC 1644), which was not widely adopted due to security issues.

John Harrison Clark

John Harrison Clark or Changa-Changa (c. 1860–1927) was an adventurer from the South African Cape who effectively ruled much of what is today southern Zambia from the early 1890s through to 1902. Alone and unassisted, he arrived to the country in about 1887, reputedly as an outlaw, and assembled and trained a private army of Senga natives, which he used to drive off various bands of slave-raiders. He took control of a bloc of territory on the north bank of the Zambezi river called Mashukulumbwe, became known as Chief "" and, through a series of treaties with local chiefs, gained mineral and labour concessions covering much of the region.
Starting in 1897, Clark attempted to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The company took little notice of him. When a local chief, Chintanda, complained to the company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself off as a company official—and had reportedly been collecting hut tax for at least two years, with no authority to do so—the company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill, where he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill for the rest of his life, he died in 1927.
Early life.
Not much is known about John Harrison Clark's early life. The son of a man "in the hardware business" (according to a military officer who later encountered him, Major Deare), he was born in Port Elizabeth, Cape Colony about 1860, and engaged for a time in the Cape Mounted Riflemen during the 1880s. A tall, physically strong man, he wore a large black moustache, and was regarded as a fine shot and a capable hunter.
Rise to power.
Arrival at Feira.
Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it is unclear why; according to a story that may be apocryphal, he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Portuguese Mozambique, from where he made his way upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by Portuguese missionaries in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town. Its last Portuguese inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half a century before, and since then it had been deserted.
The explorer David Livingstone, who visited Feira in 1856, described it as utterly ruined at that time, but still conspicuous by the ramshackle monastery buildings on the site. When Clark arrived about three decades later, the Portuguese still maintained a "boma" (fort) called Zumbo on the opposite bank of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, and out of the control of any kind of central government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. He flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.
Chieftainship.
Slave-raiding was rife in Mashukulumbwe, with Portuguese and mixed-race Chikunda-Portuguese gangs competing with each other for the capture of local Baila and Batonga people for use as slaves. Clark, who became known to the locals as "", did not approve of slavery, and resolved to take a stand against it. He raised a private army from among the Senga people, which he trained himself, and issued with a vague uniform. Some time during the early 1890s, he confronted and routed a band of Portuguese slavers who were attacking a Baila village, leading the jubilant townspeople to proclaim him a chief.
Securing this position with his growing band of Senga warriors, Clark began to collect "taxes" (which he defined himself), and to oversee the activities of foreign traders in the area. Locals paid tribute in the form of cattle, and overseas merchants wishing to work in the territory were soon required to obtain a "trading licence" from Harrison Clark before they could operate. Holders of his document had to give Clark one piece of calico textile from every bale of material they brought into the area, and, where a trader was harvesting ivory to sell overseas, Clark levied every other tusk as an "export tax". As well as regulating local trade, Clark encouraged the people to make paths between their villages, and repeatedly defended them against the various slave-raiding gangs. As his Senga troops expanded, he conferred various grandiose titles on himself, most prominently "King of the Senga" and "Chief of the Mashukulumbwe".
All of this caused considerable annoyance to the Portuguese at Zumbo, though the "boma" coexisted with Clark's settlement for the most part. The most prominent trans-river clash came when Clark attempted to demonstrate the strength of his army, and in doing so overpowered the fort's garrison, pulled down the Portuguese flag and ran up the Union Jack in its place. This done, he and his men immediately returned to Feira, leaving the British flag flying over Zumbo. "knew, of course, that as soon as he left the Portuguese would return and pull it down," Anthony Lawman writes, "but that did not matter [to Harrison Clark." His point made, he made no attempt to stop the Portuguese garrison from returning. Soon after, one of the half-caste Chikunda-Portuguese gangs ventured up the river towards Feira, intending to attack Clark, who was sitting on the riverbank taking a drink when he spotted the raiding party approaching. According to the account of one of Clark's followers, the white chief put his glass down and bellowed at the enemy leader to "voetsek you bloody nigger", whereupon the intruder and his retinue fled.
Following this, Clark consolidated his chieftainship by marrying the daughter of Mpuka, the chief of the Chikunda people. He relocated north, in 1895, to the confluence of the Lukasashi and Lunsemfwa Rivers, where he established his own village. He named the settlement "Algoa" after the Portuguese name for his birthplace, Port Elizabeth, and based it around a small stone fort, which he built and subsequently lived in. Clark's sphere of influence, which he oversaw from Algoa, is vaguely defined by W. V. Brelsford, a historian, as "the Luano Valley and the uplands as far westwards as the Kafue and southwards to Feira".
Contact with the British South Africa Company.
First meeting; Clark seeks company protection.
The British South Africa Company (BSAC), established by Cecil Rhodes in 1889, was designed to govern and develop the area immediately north of the Transvaal, with the ultimate goal of aiding Rhodes' dream of building a Cape to Cairo railway through British territory. Having a firm hold over Matabeleland, Mashonaland and Barotseland by 1894, the company began officially calling its domain "Rhodesia" in 1895. The BSAC sought to further expand its influence north of the Zambezi, and to that end regularly sent expeditions into what is now eastern Zambia to negotiate concessions with local rulers and to found settlements.
In 1896, Major Deare led one such company expedition north from the main seat of company administration, Fort Salisbury, to meet with the Ngoni chief Mpezeni, who ruled to the east of Harrison Clark. One day, to Deare's surprise, a small group of warriors approached his party from the west, carrying a letter. This message, written in English and signed ", Chief of the Mashukulumbwe", said that its author had heard of a white man being entertained recently by Mpezeni, and wished to provide the same hospitality at Algoa. On taking up this invitation, Deare was astonished to discover that "" was Clark.
Harrison Clark subsequently sought protection from the British South Africa Company. In the months following Deare's visit, he negotiated concessions with two neighbouring chiefs, Chintanda and Chapugira, each of whom signed over the mining and labour rights for his respective territory in return for a specified fee whenever Clark wished to use them. In August 1897, Clark wrote to the company administrator in Salisbury, Earl Grey, requesting that the company honour these holdings, enclosing copies of the concessions he had secured. Also providing a cursory description of gold mining prospects in the region, Clark criticised the actions of Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Warton, who was in the vicinity representing the North Charterland Exploration Company, a BSAC subsidiary. "Mashukulumbwe can be occupied without fighting," he wrote. "I am on friendly terms with all the natives, and, if necessary, can raise a force of three to seven thousand to operate on Mfisini or Mashukulumbwe. Colonel Warton's Administration of this country has been a mistake; the country is rich in alluvial and reef gold." The company took little notice of Clark, but he nevertheless continued in the same vein, acquiring similar concessions from Chief Chetentaunga, Chief Luvimbie, Chief Sinkermeronga and Chief Mubruma over the following two years.
Relations disintegrate.
Clark wrote to the company on 12 April 1899, once more attaching copies of his concessions, with an offer to supply the BSAC settlements south of the Zambezi with contract labourers taken from among his neighbouring chiefs' populations. He said he had permission from all of the chiefs involved to do so. He requested as his fee £1 per man, and said that he had agreed a monthly wage of ten shillings for each worker, plus food, accommodation and fuel. Having split his concessions into two sections to draw labour from, Clark proposed to provide Salisbury with workers from his eastern concessions, and Bulawayo with those from the west. The chiefs had agreed to provide workers on contracts lasting six months, but Clark wrote that he could attempt to supply labour all year round if the company wished.
Around the same time, Chief Chintanda crossed the river and headed south-east, towards Salisbury, hoping to discuss Harrison Clark's actions with the company. He met a local company commissioner at Mazoe on 14 April 1899 and gave to him a statement, which, among other things, said that Clark had been claiming to be a BSAC official, and had been illegally collecting hut tax and other tariffs on that basis for at least two years. Clark's labour and mining concessions, Chintanda said, had been agreed under the impression that he was representing Salisbury. Chintanda also accused Clark of raping a pregnant woman, and claimed that he was a prolific womaniser who unsettled the local population. "Whenever Clark sees a girl he fancies he takes her as his mistress for a few days, and when tired of her sends her home," Chintanda said. "The fathers and husbands of these girls are constantly complaining to me about Clark's actions, but I can do nothing as Clark is a white man, and professed to be representing the government." The chief asked the company to send a genuine representative as soon as it could.
Chintanda's affidavit caused the company to suddenly become deeply concerned about Clark's continued authority north of the river, and to begin investigating him more thoroughly. The situation was complicated when, after a month's perusal, the company's lawyers resolved that the courts in Salisbury and Bulawayo held no legal jurisdiction north of the river, and therefore could not licitly hear any case brought against Clark relating to actions north of the Zambezi. On 4 July 1899, Arthur Lawley, the company's administrator in Matabeleland, wrote to Cape Town to report the situation to the resident High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Alfred Milner. Lawley briefly summarised the charges against Clark and requested permission to hold a court north of the river under the supervision of one of three chiefs friendly to the company. Milner replied in the negative on 17 August, saying that he could not legally sanction this course of action. He told Lawley to wait until authority extended over Clark's area before pursuing the matter further.
The end of Clark's chieftainship.
On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector A. M. Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated much of what Chintanda had said regarding Clark's claims to represent the company; Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week, and had told him to have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. Mubruma asked Harte-Barry if Clark really was employed by the company, and, when told that he was not, said that he would not provide Clark with contract workers. He indicated his willingness to take part in such a scheme if the company wished, however. He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.
During 1900, the company established two forts far to the north-west of Algoa, neither of which impeded seriously on Clark's domain. The company's establishment of a "boma" at Feira in 1902 effectively ended his reign. Arguing that the company's rule over the area was less efficient than his own had been, Harrison Clark demanded that the company pay him for his concessions, which he said gave him authority over the area. The British South Africa Company had previously bought "bona fide" concessions from private individuals in a similar manner, but it refused to deal with Harrison Clark, saying his concessions had no legal validity. To persuade him to desist the company offered him compensation, the form of which differs by source; Brelsford and a man who knew Clark personally during the 1920s, Colonel N. O. Earl Spurr, say that Clark was given farms as compensation, while a 1920s business acquaintance, A. M. Bentley, writes that the company promised Clark grants of land and the right to reserve a specified number of local mining claims. Clark was initially unhappy with what he was offered, but soon acquiesced when he realised that to challenge the company he would have to travel to Salisbury, to South Africa, or perhaps even to England. Wherever he went, the legal battle would cost a great deal of money, and he could not be sure of winning. He therefore accepted the compensation, and his days as a chief were over.
Later life and death.
Clark became a farmer, and proved successful, experimenting with the growing of rubber, cotton and various other plants previously absent from the area. His cotton plantation developed promisingly for a few years, but he abandoned it after heavy rain destroyed an entire crop around 1909. He remained on the farm until the late 1910s, when he either gave or sold it to missionaries of the Catholic Church, and moved to Broken Hill, one of the largest settlements in what had become Northern Rhodesia in 1911. Here he lived for the rest of his life. Retaining "" as a nickname, he helped to develop various businesses, acted as a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia (alongside Lester Blake-Jolly), and sponsored a number of local events. He attended most Broken Hill social functions ("always most immaculately dressed", according to Spurr), owned one of the first motor vehicles in the city (a dark green Ford Model T), and donated to a number of local charities. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine.
Clark died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67. He left the modest savings he possessed at the time of his death to his sister, who was still back home in Port Elizabeth. Though he was regarded as a shrewd businessman and "one of the pillars of society in the Broken Hill of those days" (says Spurr), he had had never been considered rich. "What I liked most about this remarkable man," Bentley writes, "is that he was not keen on making money but on developing Northern Rhodesia". According to Brelsford, Clark was greatly respected by the local black people, who considered him a higher authority even after his chieftainship ended, and consulted him often to settle their disputes. "" endured in the local vernacular as a word roughly meaning "boss", and was still in use in the 1970s. M. D. D. Newitt writes that Clark embodied much of the pioneering spirit of the time, and was "an object of legend" to his fellow frontiersmen. Peter Duignan and Lewis Gann take a similar line, saying he "experienced in his own person the transition from bush feudalism to capitalism." "He had led a wild, tough life but it had not turned him either into a rascal or into an uncouth bush dweller," concludes Brelsford. "He was one of the first Northern Rhodesians and he was a grand chap."

Michael Lynche (album)

Michael Lynche is the self-titled debut album of R&B artist and "American Idol" season nine fourth place finalist Michael Lynche. It was released by independent label Big3 Records on August 14, 2012, two years after Lynche competed on the Fox reality television series. Lynche was given creative freedom over the album and holds co-writing credits on all of its original songs. He collaborated with song-writers Charlie Brown, Rob Chiarelli, Maria Christensen Gharah Degeddingseze, David Glass, Jamie Jones, D'myreo Mitchell, Monte Neuble, Jason Pennock, Wayne Rodrigues, Tim Stewart, Ryan Tedder, and Ronnie Walton. Lynche also served as a producer on the album, along with Chiarelli, Degeddingseze, Jones, Mitchell, Neuble, Pennock, Rodrigues, Stewart, Bill Edwards, and Preach. In addition to twelve original songs, the album includes a cover of "This Woman's Work" by Kate Bush - a song that Lynche had performed while competing on "American Idol".
The album was critically acclaimed. "Who's Gonna Love You More" was released as the lead single off of the album in May 2012; a music video and a lyric video of the song were both released in August. The album's second single, "Today" was released in July, and a lyric video of it was released in August.
Background.
Lynche grew up performing in a musical family. During high school, he chose to focus on football, and attended University of Central Florida on an athletic scholarship. When his mother became ill though, he took time off from school to care for her and rediscovered his love for music - song writing became a way for him to deal with his mother's death. He began reaching out to music producers in Florida, but upon his wife's suggestion, the two of them moved to New York, where he pursued a career as a recording artist. He was able to make a few connections and get some session work. However, he eventually chose to return to Florida to audition for the ninth season of "American Idol". 
Lynche's wife gave birth to their first child while he was competing on the show, and he became an early front runner after a well-received performance of "This Woman's Work" (in which a soon-to-be father yearns for his wife to make it through a complicated childbirth). Despite his perceived popularity, Lynche received the lowest number of votes during top 9 week. The judges chose to use their one save of the season to keep him in the competition, and he ultimately finished in fourth place. After being eliminated from the competition, he received encouragement from judge Randy Jackson, who reminded him that Chris Daughtry, a successful alumni of the show, had also finished in fourth place. In an interview the next day, Lynche said, "It's not a bad place to be where I am...I’m going to start working on putting together a great album, and working with some really great people."
Writing and recording.
The album took eighteen months to make. Lynche signed with Big3 Records (an independent label based in his hometown of St. Petersburg, Florida) in September 2011; although by that time, he had already been working on an album for about half-a-year. Thirteen tracks are included, of which twelve are original songs; these were chosen from around thirty. Also included is a cover of Kate Bush's "This Woman's Work", which Lynche had performed on "American Idol". Lynche co-wrote all of the original songs and also served as one of the album's producers. He has said that "finding the starting point for a song is always the hardest part." For ideas, he would keep a log in which he wrote down sayings and pieces of conversation that seemed interesting to him. He has said that Big3 Records never put any time restraints on him and gave him total creative freedom over the album. Lynche often chose to return to songs to rewrite, reproduce, or remix them, feeling that there was a perfect version to achieve for each one.
Lynche said that he tried to be more than just "Mr. R&B man" on the album, and that he did not want the album to only contain "old soul" music. Rather, he incorporated several diverse musical styles, saying, "I wanted to include a fun soul thing, a late-night R&B heavy thing, and something that morphs into an acoustic soul sound." The album explores Lynche's views on the various aspects of love, and many of the songs were inspired by his relationship with his wife. The album's first single, "Who's Gonna Love You More" was co-written with Jamie Jones and Jason Pennock - Jones is one of the lead singers of R&B/pop group All-4-One; Pennock has worked as a producer for All-4-One and is a part of Big3 Records. The song, which has been likened to the music of Luther Vandross, is in Lynche's own words, "a song about that declaration of love for whoever it is, your man, your woman, your partner, whoever it is. It’s saying that there’s nobody on this earth that’s going to love you like I love you." Pennock co-wrote seven of the album's other songs with Lynche, including "Love Is You", which Lynche has called one of his favorites on the album. Lynche said that the song started "in a small place", but developed into something much larger over time. Lynche also explored love from the perspective of a parent with the song "Baby Boo", which he wrote for his daughter Laila. Among Lynche's other collaborators on the album was dance-pop group 3rd Party's lead singer Maria Christensen, whom he had met while he was in New York before he tried out or "American Idol". Christensen co-wrote the empowerment song "Somebody Save Me." The final song on the album, "Unstoppable," is about faith. Lynche co-wrote three songs with "American Idol" season 2 winner Ruben Studdard, although none of these were ultimately included on the album.
Singles.
The album's first single, "Who's Gonna Love You More" was released on May 15, 2012, and debuted on Urban AC radio on the twenty-first. It began at number 36 on the Adult R&B chart, and peaked at number 25 in September. The song also reached number 84 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. A music video for the song was released on August eighth, and a lyric video was released on the fourteenth.
The album's second single, "Today" was released to AC radio and smooth jazz radio on July 30, 2012. It became the most added song that week on the Smooth Jazz chart and the second most added song that week on the AC chart. It was released digitally on August seventh. A lyric video of the song was released on August fifteenth.
Reception.
Melody Charles of soultracks.com highly recommended the album and praised Lynche for taking a unique approach from other modern R&B artists. Discussing "Intoxicated" and "Speechless", she wrote that Lynche displays "increasingly rare facets in urbanized love songs: awe and vulnerability about his lady that aren’t restricted to how well she happens to fill out a dress." Charles noted that even when the album takes on sexual tones, as with "Lovers Symphony" and "Sex", Lynche chooses to emphasize sensuality, rather than sexual objectification. She felt that "Baby Boo" showed Lynche to be more versatile than many of his musical contemporaries, and considered his cover of Kate Bush's "This Woman's Work" to be "worth the price of an iTunes upload all by itself." Brinda Fuller Willis of the "Jackson Advocate" considered Lynche's vocal abilities superior to many current singers. She wrote that the album evokes similarities to Barry White and contains "some of the best R & B love songs on the market today." In her view, the album shows that Lynche has successfully "tapped into his own niche as a crooner of love."
In a review for Lynche's hometown newspaper, the "Tampa Bay Times", Sean Daly compared Lynche to Luther Vandross, Barry White, and Al Green, and praised Lynch "for not copycatting the radio." Although Daly felt that "Today" and "Unstoppable" were "underwritten" and "cliche", he singled out first single "Who's Gonna Love You More", "This Woman's Work", "Sex", and "Crazy Gina" for praise, comparing the latter song to the music of Prince. Daly concluded that Lynche "could truly be a star someday." Somewhat less positive was Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for Allmusic, who gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of five. He called "Crazy Gina" one of the album's "liveliest numbers" and complimented Lyche's falsetto, but felt that the "seductive groove album" approach meant that none of the songs were able to "really pop out." "Guitar World" writer James Woods gave the album a positive review on his blog. He called "Michael Lynche" "a sonically rich and lyrically inviting debut album", and felt that it perfectly combines elements of R&B, hip-hop, and jazz.
Soultracks.com listed "Michael Lynche" as an honorable mention in its list of the best albums of 2012.
Mark Franklin of the "York Dispatch"'s blog "Idol Chatter" chose "Crazy Gina" as the eighth best 2012 song by an "American Idol" alumni. He called it "a funky delight" and suggested that Lynche's follow up album should contain more songs like it.

Leeds Municipal election, 1969

The Leeds municipal election was held on 8 May 1969, with one third of the councillors up for election. The Conservative incumbent in Armley had defected to Independent Conservative in the interim and hoped to defend it as such.
In contrast to their performance nationally, the Tories fell back upon their peak the previous year, with Labour managing to stabilise their support somewhat. The sole beneficiary (unlike last year, the Communists dropped back to their normal support) were the Liberals, who obtained their largest vote since 1963. In total three seats changed hands, with a spectacular gain in West Hunslet by the Liberals from the Conservatives, another loss of the latter's to Labour in Osmondthorpe, offset a little by a comfortable win back in Armley from their former incumbent.
Election result.
The result had the following consequences for the total number of seats on the Council after the elections:

David Thomas (cricketer, born 1959)

David James Thomas (30 June 1959 – 28 July 2012) was an English cricketer who played for Surrey. 
David Thomas was a promising left-arm medium-fast swing bowler who represented the England Young Cricketers in 1978 and was tipped as a future Test cricketer. He was also a hard-hitting tail-end batsman good enough to score two centuries in first-class cricket. 
He played his part in taking Surrey to four Lord's finals between 1979 and 1982. He was awarded the Man of the Match Award for his 3-26 versus Warwickshire in the 1982 NatWest Trophy final which helped Surrey to win the match, and was awarded his county cap during the same season. He claimed 57 first-class wickets in 1983 and 60 in 1984. In 1983 he also came close to 1,000 first-class runs, with 937 at an average of 36.03, scoring two centuries. The closest he came to Test selection was that season, being twelfth man (i.e. reserve) for the Trent Bridge Test against New Zealand.
He spent two close seasons representing the South African teams Natal and Northern Transvaal in the Currie Cup. He remained popular with his team-mates but a short-lived move to Gloucestershire in 1988 was cut short when he was forced to retire through multiple sclerosis aged 29. He became an active fundraiser for the charity for the rest of his life. He died from complications arising from the disease in July 2012 aged 53. He left a widow Louise and four children.

Baidar ech Chamout

Baidar ech Chamout, Baïdar ech Chamoût or Beidar Chamout is a small village located northeast of Machgara in the Western Beqaa District of Beqaa Governorate in Lebanon.
A Heavy Neolithic archaeological site of the Qaraoun culture is located in the area on the right bank of the Litani river, where the North Cheeta exits from a ravine opposite the Dahr er Rimoul foothills. It was found by Henri Fleisch in 1952 in an area of approximately by in the fields around a fountain of the Machgara spring on a track approximately southwest of cote 853. It was described in detail in Fleisch's report of 1954 and again in 1960. Jacques Cauvin also examined and published details of the materials found, then stored with the Saint Joseph University (now the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory). The Heavy Neolithic pieces were considered identical to those found at Qaraoun II.
A later Neolithic assemblage was found thought to be similar to the Neolithic récent of Byblos consisting of adzes, rabots, chisels and cores. Another assemblage without any triangular points was tentatively suggested to date to the middle Paleolithic, although may actually be Neolithic. The area was under cultivation in 1966.

Coventry City F.C. in European football

Coventry City Football Club is an English football club based in Coventry, West Midlands. The club was founded in 1883 and has competed in the English football league system since 1919. Their first and so far only season in major European cup competition came when they reached the second round of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1970–71 season. They also took part in the Texaco Cup in the 1970s.
History.
1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.
"The Sky Blues"' maiden European voyage was the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which they took part in with fellow English clubs Newcastle United, Arsenal, Liverpool and eventual winners Leeds United. Coventry's first opponents were Bulgarian side Trakia Plovdiv. A 4–1 away win in which John O'Rourke scored a hat-trick was followed up with a 2–0 home win to send the English club through to face FC Bayern Munich. However, a 6–1 defeat at Grünwalder Stadion meant that a 2–1 win for Coventry in the second leg was not enough, and they were duly eliminated.
1971–72 Texaco Cup.
Coventry entered the Texaco Cup for the first time in 1971–72 and faced Falkirk in the first round, and needed extra time to beat them, to set up a tie with Newcastle United. After a 1–1 draw at home, Coventry were roundly beaten 5–1 at St James' Park and exited the competition.
1972–73 Texaco Cup.
Coventry's second Texaco Cup campaign was even more brief than the first as Motherwell beat Coventry in the second leg after a drawn first leg to send the West Midlands club out.
1973–74 Texaco Cup.
Motherwell were again the first round opposition as Coventry embarked upon their third Texaco Cup tournament, and again the Lanarkshire club would frustrate them as wins home and away saw '"Well" progress.
1985–91.
English clubs were banned from taking part in European competition in the aftermath of the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. This affected the "Sky Blues" when they won the FA Cup in 1986–87. This achievement would normally be rewarded with a place in the 1987–88 European Cup Winners' Cup, however the ban meant they did not compete. The ban was in place until 1990–91, and England did not reacquire the full (pre-1985) number of places to award in European club competition until 1995–96. The FA Cup win coincided with an attempt to resurrect the Anglo-Scottish Cup in 1987–88 as the Anglo Scottish Challenge Cup. It saw Coventry pitted with 1986–87 Scottish Cup winners St. Mirren, however poor attendances at the first leg (a 1–1 draw at Highfield Road) meant that the revival was halted, and the second leg was never played.

Yoshio Yoshida (pilot)

Career.
In 1921, Yoshida was born in Hiroshima, the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture. In 1939, he enrolled as an officer candidate in the 55th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Academy northwest of Tokyo. He completed his studies in March 1942 and was directed to the Akeno Fighter School to learn advanced fighter techniques. After this he was assigned to the 70th Sentai, flying the Nakajima Ki-44 "Shōki", called "Tojo" by the Allies of World War II.
On 29 July 1944, American XX Bomber Command attacked Japanese military forces in Anshan, Manchuria, with 96 very heavy bombers. In August, Yoshida's air group moved to the Anshan area to provide air defense, flying the uprated Ki-44-II, with four larger 12.7 mm (.5 in) machine guns and a more powerful engine. On 8 September, 108 of the B-29s returned. The 70th Sentai rose to meet them and First Lieutenant Yoshida claimed one probable.
American B-29 groups were next directed to bomb Japan itself, so to counter the attacks the 70th Sentai was transferred in November 1944 to Kashiwa, Chiba, northeast of Tokyo. The fighter pilots were given newer 20 mm Ho-5 cannon-equipped Nakajima Ki-84 machines, called "Frank" by the Allies. In February, Captain Yoshida was made the leader of 3rd Chutai; a position he held until the end of the war in August 1945. He brought to his squadron an aggressive determination to score against the B-29s; on 13 April and again on 15 April he shot down a B-29 in night actions. He scored against four more in the following six weeks—all at night. Yoshida was awarded the "Bukosho", his citation mentioning the bravery of the September 1944 action in the obsolescent Ki-44.
In the summer of 1945, Yoshida underwent testing to see if he was physically fit enough to fly the rocket-powered Mitsubishi J8M "Shūsui", Japan's copy of the German Messerschmitt Me 163 "Komet". The war ended before he was able to fly one of these aircraft.

2012 Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships in Athletics

The 19th Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships were held in the Estadio Jorge "Mágico" González in San Salvador, El Salvador, between 29 June and 1 July, 2012. The event was open for athletes from the invited countries, that are members of the Central American and Caribbean Athletic Confederation (CACAC), in two categories (newly defined in 2012): Junior A Category: 18 to 19 years as of 31 December 2012 (born either 1993 or 1994), and Junior B Category: 14 to 17 years as of 31 December 2012 (born in 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998). By IAAF standards, Junior A is equal to Junior, while Junior B is equal to Youth.
There were numerous changes as compared to the last competition held in 
2010:
The 17-year old athletes competed in the Junior B category (rather than Junior
A). 2000 metres steeplechase was replaced by 3000 metres steeplechase in the
female Junior A category. 110 metres hurdles replaced 100 metres hurdles, and
10,000 metres racewalk replaced 5000 metres racewalk in the male Junior B
category. And finally, in the female Junior B category, 3000 metres, 2000
metres steeplechase, pole vault, and hammer throw (3kg) were held for the 
first time, while 1500 metres replaced 1200 metres, 400 metres hurdles
replaced 300 metres hurdles, 5000 metres racewalk replaced 4000 metres 
racewalk, and new implements for shot put (3 kg rather than 4kg) and javelin
(500 g rather 600 g) were used. 
In the Junior A category, a lot of athletes were preparing for the 14th World Junior Championships in Barcelona, Spain on 10–15 July 2012.
A detailed discussion of the results was given elsewhere.
Records.
A couple of new championship records were set. 
Medal summary.
The results are published. Events marked as "Exhibition" did not meet the official conditions with respect to the minimum number of participants (“not less than

<doc id="36610939" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36610939" title="Khirbet Zanuta">
Khirbet Zanuta

Khirbet Zanuta () is a Palestinian village in the Hebron Governorate in the southern West Bank, located 20 kilometers south of Hebron. Nearby localities include ad-Dhahiriya to the northwest, Khirbet Shweika to the northwest and the Israeli settlements of Teneh Omarim to the west and Shim'a to the east. The village is adjacent to the Green Line.
According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Khirbet Zanuta had a population of 60 in the 2007 census, an increase from 1997 when six residents were recorded. The four principal families are the as-Samamera, al-Tel, al-Batat and al-Qaysiyah. In 2012 the number of families registered at Zanuta was 27.
There are no schools, health care facilities or pharmacies in Khirbet Zanuta and residents travel 10 kilometers to ad-Dhahiriya to obtain those services. Agriculture is the main economic activity, employing most of the village's working residents. The total land area is approximately 12,000 dunams, of which roughly 3,000 are cultivated, mostly with field crops. Much of the remaining land area is considered "open spaces," while one dunam is classified as built-up areas.
History.
Pottery shards at Zanuta indicate continuous settlement since the Iron Age, and archeologist Avi Ofer has proposed an identification of the site with Dana in the fifth group of Judean cities in the south Hebron hills. Some of the ruins apparently dated to Byzantine period, but there was also signs of the recent destruction of a village. Byzantine pottery has been found in the village.
French explorer and amateur archaeologist Victor Guérin passed through the area in 1863, and described its ruins, which were strewn over the summit and flanks of the hill. He found
Numerous tumbled-down houses, of average size, that had mostly been built in earlier times from regularly cut stones, nearly all of which enclosed a cave drilled out of the rockface; cisterns lay around on all sides, and there was a pool ("birket") dug partially from the rock, and partially built from stone, measuring 20 by 17 paces. There were also traces of an ancient mosque, constructed, particularly in its corners, with magnificent masonry that had no doubt been harvested from a Christian basilica ... Not to be overlooked also were the remains of a small freestone structure, with all the appearance of a sanctuary, perhaps a mausoleum dating back to the Roman period. All that survives of it is a section of wall rising from the bedrock and embellished with two pilasters between which one can see a vaulted niche touched off with elegant mouldings and probably designed to house a small statue.
The place was also surveyed in 1874, and extensive ruins were found, including the remains of a "good-sized mosque."
Zanuta was a cave settlement of local peoples predating Israel's occupation of the West Bank after the Six Day War in 1967, and archaeological studies attest to continuous habitation at the site from the Byzantine to the Ottoman period, when it eventually dwindled to "a settlement of shepherds and fellahs living in the remains of the ancient structures and the residential caves alongside them," of families that, according to Shuli Hartman, came to the caves from the nearby town of ad-Dhahiriya in the early 20th century. When the caves became uninhabitable in the 1980s, the villagers built stone houses with tin and plastic roofs to dwell in, and kept external pens and the caves as shelters for their sheep.
Moves to demolish the village.
In 2007, Zanuta residents, assisted by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, filed a joint petition to the High Court of Justice asking that the Civil Administration provide them with a complete construction plan. As a result of the petition they received an interim order from the court.
In 2011, an Israeli NGO Regavim, whose objective, according to Hass is 'to protect what it calls national (Jewish) land and to demolish Palestinian structures . .built without a permit,' revived the case, filing an amicus curiae request, at which the state of Israel then submitted a full reply to the Zanuta villagers' petition.
As one of a dozen villages in the South Hebron Hills, Zanuta has been slated for demolition by the IDF, and the villagers are to be expelled from Area C of the West Bank to areas under Palestinian authority. The Israeli civil administration claims that the demolition order is related to the fact that it lies directly over an archeological site, so recognized under the British mandate, and therefore regularisation of their village structures is ruled out. Archeologist Avi Ofer, who did his doctoral research on the area, has expressed astonishment at the extent of the area -120 dunams (30 acres), - defined as the "Zanuta archaeology site" by the Civil Administration. In his view the real site covers half or less that size.
According to Amira Hass, while calling for the demolition of Palestinian villages, Israeli authorities have approved construction in Jewish settlements on more imposing archaeological sites, such as the settlement at Tel Rumeida in Hebron, or in Jerusalem itself. The state declared that the military were not obliged to find a solution for the villagers, and demands that they be moved out to ad-Dhahiriya. In response to petitions by the villagers, the High Court has ruled that the state had 30 days to find a solution to the impasse either by providing permits or making appropriate arrangements for the villagers.
On 29 August 2012 the Israeli governing authority on the West Bank destroyed two cisterns, some used to catch rainfall, used by Khirbet Zanuta shepherds and farmers. Three others were destroyed at nearby Khirbet Anizat. Together they lost five sheepfolds, two tents, a tin shack and two improvised food storage sheds. According to Khirbet Zanuta residents one of the cisterns was hundreds of years old. Some of the cisterns were created with the assistance of a Polish NGO.

Fire and wreck.
At the end of its second voyage to Australia in 1859 with 419 government immigrants the "Herald of the Morning" was anchored in Hobson's Bay, when at about 12:45 pm on 15 November the captain awoke to someone yelling out FIRE! The fire quickly spread through the entire vessel. Despite attempts to scuttle the ship by cutting holes in her side near the waterline, as she burnt and became lighter so that the scuttling holes rose above the water level. An attempt was made to move the ship, by slipping the anchor chains, but the heat drove the crew back from the other. Finally it was cut through from the outside and towed ashore at Sandridge (Port Melbourne) by two tugs, the "Lioness" and "Sophia", and left to burn.
The tugs "Sophia" and "Hercules" later towed the ship to the beach between Sandridge and Williamstown where she continued to smolder (UID 152). The hulk was eventually removed and sunk at the end of Donaldsons jetty in about 1889.
Included in the cargo was iron work intended for the Hawthorn Bridge, and while this was recovered, the fire had damaged it. It was subsequently salvaged and partly sold at auction eventually to became the trusses for the Mia Mia Bridge at Redesdale. The wreck was advertised for sale on 29 November 1859.
The hulk appears to have remained sitting on the beach form many years until the Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners adopted the following recommendations of its Finance Committee:

Previous guests have included international violinist Rachel Barton Pine, female Rapper Dessa, Sound Opinions’ Jim DeRogatis, NPR’s Peter Sagal, Saturday Night Live alums Tim Kazurinsky and Nora Dunn, Project Runway’s Peach Carr, James Beard chef Paul Kahan, Michelin star chef Homaro Cantu, award winning director Steve James, international spoken word artist Kevin Coval, Goodman Theatre’s Robert Falls, "Sex and the City" and "Chicago Fire" TV star David Eigenburg, author Scott Turow, film critic Richard Roeper, Chicago Bears tight end Martellus Bennett and Chicago Bears general manager Phil Emery, among many others.
Show Format.
Each show begins with an opening act. The main show runs for 90 minutes, with host Elysabeth Alfano facilitating conversation between her three guests. Alfano picks guests from a variety of fields to talk about the creative experience. Each guest performs live or has their work featured in some way throughout the course of the show. Additionally, demo videos highlight the food that the chef prepares for the guests and the audience.
Venue.
The show premiered January 30, 2012 at the Mayne Stage in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood. The lineup featured artist Tony Fitzpatrick, artist and The Mekon’s band member Jon Langford, and director Rachel Rockford as guests, with Chef Homaro Cantu of MOTO.

The Citadel Bulldogs football teams represented The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina, United States. The program was established in 1905. Their primary rivals are Furman University and Virginia Military Institute. The games against VMI are dubbed the Military Classic of the South, referring to the two schools' status as the only remaining southern, state-supported, all-military schools.
The 1990s saw some of the Bulldogs' most successful seasons of football, with the program making its second and third appearances in the NCAA Division I Football Championship and claiming wins over higher level teams such as Arkansas, South Carolina and Army. The end of the decade, though, saw a return to mediocrity.

Bodu Bala Sena

Bodu Bala Sena (; literary "Buddhist Power Force"; BBS) is a Sinhalese Buddhist nationalist monastic organisation based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
According to "The Economist", BBS "supports militancy against minorities to preserve the dominance of the Buddhist majority." It particularly targets the Muslim minority.
Organization.
The BBS was founded by monks Kirama Wimalajothi and Galagoda Aththe Gnanasaara after they broke away from Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) claiming it was not militant enough in protecting Buddhism. Gnanasara had been one of the JHU candidates in Colombo District at the 2004 parliamentary election. Wimalajothi Thero and Gnanasara Thero are leader and general secretary of BBS respectively. Its headquarters are located at Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi Mandira in Colombo. Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi Mandira is owned by the Buddhist Cultural Centre, an organisation also founded by former leader Kirama Wimalajothi. The Buddhist Cultural Centre was opened by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on 15 May 2011.
Time magazine called the BBS "Sri Lanka's most powerful Buddhist organisation".
History.
One of earliest campaigns by BBS was in respect of Buddhist Sri Lankans working in the Middle East who, according to BBS, were prevented from practising their religion and punished harshly if found to be doing so.
The BBS held its first national convention at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall on 28 July 2012. The convention passed five resolutions which, amongst other things, called for a ban on vasectomy/tubectomy in government health facilities; replacement of the various legal systems used in the country with a single legal system; preferential treatment in university admission for students who attended Buddhism classes; use of monks in government schools to teach history and other classes; and no solution for the country's ethnic problems which was based on race/religion.
The BBS held a protest at the Bangladeshi High Commission in Colombo on 4 October 2012 against the anti-Buddhist riots in Bangladesh. Some of the protesters threw stones and bottles at the High Commission.
On 14 October 2012 BBS stormed a house in Batakettara, Homagama, Piliyandala where it alleges a Christian pastor called Dinesh and others from an evangelical group called "The Name of Lord Jesus" were trying to convert Sinhalese Buddhists. The pastor was later released but following complaints from the pastor's family seven people were arrested on charges of abduction. The following day BBS held a protest outside Piliyandala Police Station demanding that the seven arrested be released.
The BBS held a protest rally in Badulla on 25 October 2012 against alleged conversion, vandalism of Buddhist sites and Islamic terrorism. They held a protest at the Department of Archeology on 29 November 2012 urging the authorities to protect archaeological sites in the Eastern Province.
The BBS stormed Sri Lanka Law College in Hultsdorf, Colombo on 7 January 2013, alleging that exam results were being distorted in favour of Muslim students. The allegations were not true but the college was forced to delay new student registration by one week in order to investigate the allegations.
The BBS stormed the Cinnamon Bay Hotel in Moragalla, Beruwala on 21 January 2013, alleging that the premises contained a "Buddha bar" (associating sacred symbols with such places as bars is considered sacrilege). Two hotel managers were arrested by the police for organising the "Buddha bar" event.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa and government ministers met with the BBS on 27 January 2013 at Temple Trees, Colombo. After the meeting the President issued a statement which urged the BBS and other monks to avoid conflicts with other religious communities but this statement was only issued in English, not Sinhala which is the language of most BBS supporters.
The opposition United National Party met with the BBS on 12 February 2013.
The BBS organised a meeting in Maharagama, Colombo on 17 February 2013 which was attended by around 16,000 people including 1,300 monks. At the rally the BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara stated "This is a government created by Sinhala Buddhists and it must remain Sinhala Buddhist. This is a Sinhala country, Sinhala government. Democratic and pluralistic values are killing the Sinhala race". He also told the crowd at the rally that they "must become an unofficial civilian police force against Muslim extremism. These so-called democrats are destroying the Sinhala race". At the rally the BBS unveiled the "Maharagama Declaration", a ten-point resolution which, other than an end to halal certification, called for a ban on Sri Lankan women going to work in the Middle East; end of mosque building financed by the Middle East; and ban some contraceptives.
In February 2013 former BBS leader Kirama Wimalajothi called for a ban burqas in the country. The BBS has also campaigned against the abaya.
The BBS met with the of the Lieutenant General Jagath Jayasuriya, Major General Shavendra Silva and others from the Sri Lanka Army in late February 2013 to discuss extremist Muslim groups that the BBS alleged were operating in the country. BBS also met with IGP N. K. Illangakoon from the police on 1 March 2013 to discuss the same issues.
Meth Sevana, the BBS' cultural and training centre in Pilana, Wanchawala, Galle District, was officially opened on 9 March 2013 by chief guest Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, brother of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The BBS held a rally in Kandy on 17 March 2013 at which it announced that it would work to remove a 10th-century mosque at the Kuragala Buddhist monastery complex in Ratnapura District. At the rally BBS alleged that Muslim fundamentalists had taken over the site and destroyed Buddhist heritage. BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara accused the Muslim owned "Fashion Bug" and "No Limit" retail chains of converting its Buddhist Sinhalese employees to Islam.
The BBS held a rally in Panadura on 24 March 2013 at which it called on the country to rally against Christian and Muslim extremists, insisting Sri Lanka was a Sinhala Buddhist country, not a multiracial or multi-religious country. At the rally BBS called for High Commissioner Ferial Ashraff to be recalled from Singapore for allegedly carrying out anti-Sinhala activities. At the rally BBS announced that a ringtone could be downloaded from Mobitel, the state-owned mobile phone operator, which would raise funds for BBS. This caused protests from Mobitel customers and the company was forced to apologise for causing "emotional distress".
A nationwide protest by Muslims against the anti-Muslim campaigns being carried out by the BBS and JHU was held on 25 March 2013. The protests were organised by the Muslim Rights Organization (MRO). A hartal was observed in the Eastern Province on the same day against the BBS' anti-Muslim stance.
The Muslim owned "Fashion Bug" clothes shop in Pepiliyana, Colombo District was attacked on 28 March 2013 by a mob led by Buddhist monks. Some reports suggested that BBS was behind the attack. BBS denied any involvement and condemned the attack.
On 31 March 2013 it was reported that the government was going to ban a number of extremist groups including the BBS. Reacting to the reports, BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara described Minister of National Languages and Social Integration Vasudeva Nanayakkara as a disgrace and a peacenik, saying "Such ministers should be sent to Angoda once in three months, to have their heads examined". Nanayakkara denied the reports, saying that the government wasn't going to ban extremist groups like the BBS, it was only considering banning hate speech.
In April 2013 a group of BBS members led by general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara visited the USA to raise awareness of the organisation and counter its negative image.
Halal certification issue.
In February 2013 the BBS started a campaign against the halal certifying system in the country. In Sri Lanka halal certification is carried out by the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU), the group of Islamic clerics. Certificates are only issued to businesses that request it, and the certificate is issued for fee where the contributions are used by the ACJU to fund islamic religious activities. The BBS initially threatened to take the ACJU to court. Later they threatened to launch a campaign of agitation against halal certification, stating "they Muslims are trying to impose their ritualistic food products upon this country. The next plan is to bring about Sharia law. Already there is Muslim banking system in the country." At the rally in Maharagama on 17 February 2013 the BBS announced that it was calling for the abolition of the halal certifying system, demanding that shops be cleared of halal meat by April.
In late February 2013 the ACJU offered to hand over responsibility for halal certifying to the government but this was rejected by the BBS who called for the complete eradication halal certification in the country. The BBS slammed the ACJU as "arrogant, corrupt, thieving, underworld thugs". The government also refused to take over halal certification due to the pressure exerted by the BBS.
The BBS stormed a meat inspection facility in Dematagoda run by Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) on 1 March 2013, alleging that young calves, pregnant cows and water buffaloes were being slaughtered at the premises. The slaughter of calves is illegal in Colombo. The BBS were incorrect – the premises were being used by CMC officials to inspect meat prior to being distributed around the city.
Meetings were held between the ACJU, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) and Buddhist clergy and on 11 March 2013 a compromise was announced. The ACJU would stop adding the halal logo on products for local consumption but continue to use them for products being exported to Islamic countries where it is compulsory. This offer was also rejected on 12 March 2013 by the BBS who continued to demand "the eradication of the entire Halal process". The BBS went on to attack those responsible for the compromise. They accused Milinda Moragoda, a government minister, of "creating an unholy inter-religious alliance, and attempting to destroy our learned monks. These revered bhikkus are now in the grasp of infidels". They branded the Buddhist clergy as "pseudo Buddhist leaders who never stood against Muslim extremism and Christian fundamentalism." They accused the CCC chairman Susantha Ratnayake of having a "Buddha bar" at a hotel he runs.
The government pronounced on 13 March 2013 that the ACJU had no power to issue halal certificates and that a new way to certify halal products would need to be formulated. On 17 March 2013 the BBS declared victory in its battle against halal, saying it wouldn't talk about halal in the future.
2014 anti-Muslim riots.
On Poson Poya (12 June 2014) Buddhist monk Ayagama Samitha and his driver were allegedly assaulted by Muslims in Dharga Town. A mob from Samitha's temple, together with the priest, stormed Aluthgama Police Station demanding that immediate action be taken. Three Muslims were arrested and remanded until 25 June 2014 by the courts. That evening a tense situation arose in Aluthgama as a group of Sinhalese Buddhists started protesting against the alleged assault. The protest turned violent and the mob started throwing stones at the police and attacking Muslim shops. Three people were arrested over the violence.
On 15 June 2014 the BBS staged rallies in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. Addressing a cheering crowd in Aluthgama, BBS leader Galagoda Aththe Gnanasaara threatened "In this country we still have a Sinhala police; we still have a Sinhala army. After today if a single Marakkalaya in context used derogatorily or some other paraya outcast, also a derogatory term touches a single Sinhalese…..it will be their end."
After its rally the BBS drove into Dharga Town chanting anti-Muslim slogans. Local residents started throwing stones at the BBS convoy which resulted in violent clashes erupting between the two groups. Eyewitnesses reported Muslim homes and a mosque being stoned. Muslims were pulled off buses and assaulted whilst the Buddhist mob threw Molotov cocktails, burning and looting Muslim shops and homes. Muslim residents were forced to flee from their homes and seek shelter in mosques and community centres. There was rioting in Beruwala as well. At least four people were killed and 80 injured. Hundreds were made homeless following attacks on homes, shops, factories, mosques and a nursery. 10,000 people (8,000 Muslims and 2,000 Sinhalese) were displaced by the riots. The BBS was widely blamed for inciting the riots but it has denied responsibility.
Attacks on media.
The BBS general secretary Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara has accused the majority of the English language media in the country of "working on foreign agendas" and of being "kalu suddho" (traitors) to the Sinhala Buddhist cause.
A BBC News crew filming the BBS rally at Maharagama on 17 February 2013 were surrounded by a mob of twenty young men who threatened them and verbally abused a Sri Lankan member of the crew, accusing him of being a "traitor", having "foreign parents" and working for a "foreign conspirator" who was "against Sri Lanka". The police seemed to be helping the crew by barricading the crew and ordering them not to leave. The mob threatened it would "be the end" of the crew if they returned to Maharagama. A reporter from the Muslim newspaper "Navamini" was also harassed at the rally by a mob who handed him over to the police who in turn detained the reporter for 4½ hours.
Criticism and controversies.
The BBS has received criticism from politicians, human rights groups, other Buddhist clergy and Muslims from Sri Lanka and abroad.
"Bodu Bala Sena" has drawn criticism from notable representatives of every political party which represent the Sri Lankan parliament except "Jathika Hela Urumaya", a Sinhala nationalist political party, for its ideology and actions. Some believe BBS is a front group for Western countries who wish to divide the Sri Lankan population in order to serve western interests. For example, Wimal Weerawansa, a Sri Lankan government minister, has asked that BBS challenge "the Norway agent in its organization" in response to BBS's challenge to him to prove BBS has received funds from a Norwegian NGO.
Minister of National Languages and Social Integration Vasudeva Nanayakkara has described BBS as an "an extremist group that comes up with provoking statements". Opposition MP and former Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has accused the BBS of being "a representation of ‘Taliban’ terrorism’" and of spreading extremism and communal hatred against Muslims. Samaraweera has also alleged that the BBS is secretly funded by the Ministry of Defence. The BBS demanded a public apology for Samaraweera's comments, calling him bankrupt and accusing him of supporting separatists. Former ambassador Dayan Jayatilleka has described the BBS as an "ethno-religious fascist movement from the dark underside of Sinhala society". Vikramabahu Karunaratne, leader of the Nava Sama Samaja Party, has labelled the BBS as an extremist religious group.
The International Crisis Group has stated that the BBS' attacks on the Muslim community will lead to an increase in Islamic fundamentalism in the country. The Islamic Human Rights Commission has accused the BBS of "spreading religious hatred" and urged the Sri Lankan government to take legal action against organisations which attack minority groups. The Asian Human Rights Commission has described the BBS as an "expression of the widespread lawlessness in the country", claiming that the government's failure to take action against groups such as the BBS demonstrated the government's connivance. Minority Rights Group International has accused BBS of being the main group behind the recent spate of attacks against Muslims in the country. In its 2012 human rights report, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office accused BBS of increasing "campaigns against religious minorities".
The views of the BBS have been disowned by some of the mainstream Buddhist clergy. Anunayake Bellanwila Wimalaratana has stated that "The views of the Bodu Bala Sena are not the views of the entire Sangha community".
Opposition provincial councillor and MRO president Mujeebur Rahuman has stated that the unfettered activities of the BBS will mean an "ethnic riot will start between Sinhalese and Muslims". The Eastern Provincial Council passed a motion unanimously on 20 February 2013 censuring the BBS for its anti-Muslim stance. Kalmunai Municipal Council passed a motion on 4 April 2013 against extremist groups including the BBS, urging crackdown on these groups.
A group calling itself "Buddhists Questioning Bodu Bala Sena" staged a peaceful candle-lit vigil on 12 April 2013 outside the BBS' headquarters at Sri Sambuddha Jayanthi Mandira. The vigil was broken up by the police.

Progress M-16M

Progress M-16M (), identified by NASA as Progress 48 or 48P, is a Progress spacecraft used by Roskosmos to resupply the International Space Station during 2012. The sixteenth Progress-M 11F615A60 spacecraft, it has the serial number 416 and was built by RKK Energia.
It was the 126th launch to the ISS and the fifteenth Russian space launch in 2012. It was also the seventh mission for the Soyuz family of rockets since the beginning of the year.
Launch.
The spacecraft was launched on time at 19:35:13 GMT from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Ten minutes after liftoff, the Soyuz-U Rocket carrying Progress M-16M successfully delivered the spacecraft to orbit to begin its International Space Station (ISS) Resupply Mission.
Docking.
Progress M-16M debuted the use of a fast approach rendezvous profile that saw the spacecraft docking on its fourth orbit, as opposed to docking about 50 hours after launch on previous Progress flights. This profile allows the transportation of critical biological payloads to the ISS. After testing on Progress flights, the same rendezvous profile is being used on manned Soyuz flights to reduce crew fatigue.
Undocking and decay.
Progress M-16M departed the Pirs Docking Compartment at 13:15:27 GMT on February 9, 2013 performing a nominal undocking to begin a very short free flight.
Cargo.

<doc id="36611248" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36611248" title="Thexton Ranch">
Thexton Ranch

The Thexton Ranch, also known as Thextondale, was established by George Thexton in 1872 on the Madison River about south of Ennis, Montana. The ranch is a significant example of an operating Montana ranch, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its prominence in local history and its character as a ranching operation.
History.
Thexton had been born in England in 1824, and emigrated to the United States in 1855 with his wife Nancy Redhead Thexton. They settled in Grant County, Wisconsin, where Thexton took up his trade as a blacksmith. George remained there until 1864, when he left his family in Wisconsin and went to seek his fortune in the Alder Gulch goldfields of Montana, taking his tools with him. Having seen an opportunity to establish a business in Montana, he returned to Wisconsin to fetch his wife and four children. By the time they had reached Montana in 1867 there were five children. Thexton opened a blacksmith shop in Virginia City. In 1871 he established the Star Livery stable. By the next year he was able to buy his first on the Madison from Charles Johnson. George continued to manage his businesses in Virginia City, building a stone house there in 1884. By 1888 his wife and his two oldest sons had died, and George moved to the ranch with his surviving son Thomas, his daughter Annie, and his niece Agnes Whalley. George Thexton lived on the ranch until his death in 1904. 
Thomas Thexton had helped his father and had operated a cartage business hauling freight around Madison County. Thomas concentrated on building up herds of shorthorn cattle and horse after he moved to the ranch. He married Mary Ann Foreman in 1899. In 1910 Thomas hired a carpenter to build a new house which was completed in 1912, and expanded the ranch to more than 500 acres. Thomas died in 1929 and his wife and sons operated the ranch. Tom Thexton moved into the original ranch log ranch house while his mother, sisters and brothers lived in the newer stone house. The ranch prospered during World War II. By 1977, when Don and Tom Thexton sold the ranch, it had expanded to comprise ares, with an additional of leased land. The log ranch house was torn down. The ranch continues as an active cattle ranch.
Description.
The ranch headquarters is located on a bench along Blaine Spring Creek, near the Madison River about to the east. The chief structure is the 1910-1912 ranch house, built by Jake Bauer. The house is a two-story cast-in-place concrete building with a hipped pyramidal roof. Large stones have been cast into the walls. There are two enclosed porches. A one-story log bunkhouse is located behind the main house, with two rooms, one storage and the other a room for a hired hand. The two -story log barn is to the south of the bunkhouse. It is believed to have been built before 1912. A root cellar, also built before 1912 is to the north of the barn. The by log granary remains as well. A hay road runs from the barn, past the granary and down to a ford on Blaine Spring Creek, running in a coulee down to the hay fields in the stream valley.
Present.
The original Thexton Ranch is presently part of the north unit of the Alton Ranch. The Thexton Ranch was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 12, 2006.

<doc id="36611269" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36611269" title="Levamisole Induced Necrosis Syndrome">
Levamisole Induced Necrosis Syndrome

Levamisole Induced Necrosis Syndrome (LINES) is a complication of adulterated cocaine recognized in 2011.
Origins and history.
In 2011 a team of physicians from University Of South Florida Morsani College Of Medicine in Tampa, FL (under the attending service of John Sinnott, MD FACP) recognized an association of skin necrosis with use of levamisole adulterated cocaine. The mnemonic LINES was coined to name the syndrome because the name was descriptive, reminds one of a “line” of cocaine, and is easily remembered. Thus it is self exemplifying.6
Description.
Levamisole.
Levamisole, a levo rotatory isomer of imidazothiazole, was previously approved as an antihelminthic and immunomodulator. It experienced some usage for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but was primarily used for the treatment of parasitic infections. It was withdrawn from the U.S's market in early 2000 because of adverse health events.4 However, it is still approved in the United States as an antihelminthic agent in veterinary medicine.1
Levamisole toxicity in cocaine supply.
Levamisole has become a common additive to illicit cocaine. It is thought to intensify the “high” by releasing dopamine in the brain, it also acts as a bulking agent and, finally is a difficult adulterant to recognize. Potential risks of levamisole-laced cocaine include neutropenia, agranulocytosis, arthralgias, retiform purpura and skin necrosis, fever and neutropenia.2,3 The skin necrosis associated with levamisole toxicity ranges from leukocytoclastic vasculitis to occlusive vasculopathy. Several cases of severe agranulocytosis associated with cocaine use have been reported since 2006. With the recently recognized dermal disease, the face and ears are commonly affected, especially the bilateral helices and cheeks. However, there have also been case reports of involvement of the abdomen, chest, lower buttocks and legs3,5.
Diagnosis and treatment.
Initial case report.
LINES was first described in a 54-year-old male with history of hypothyroidism who presented to an urgent care facility with bilateral axillary adenopathy and severe malaise. Incision and drainage of the nodes was performed and he was discharged home with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for presumed Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. 
The patient subsequently developed a temperature of 37.5°C, expressed rigors, and night sweats. He returned to the ED the next day and on further history admitted to 3 weeks of “snorting 6-8 lines of coke a day” and smoking marijuana every evening to “come down.” He was hospitalized and treated with cefepime, doxycycline, and fluconazole empirically. The next day erythematous painful papules appeared on his trunk, arms, face, and ears. Blood cultures were negative. There was prominent necrosis of the malar region, nose, and lips with complete sparing of the back. Skin biopsy revealed extensive small vessel thrombosis throughout the superficial and deep dermal plexuses with perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate and a few neutrophils surrounding the vessels. ESR was elevated at 35 mm/hour; cardiolipin IgM was weakly positive at 16.3;C4 was decreased at 10 mg/dl; antinuclear antibodies were negative and p-ANCA was reactive. Coagulation studies were within normal limits. There was an elevated d-dimer of 17.54 mg/mL and platelets were slightly decreased. The patient’s urine drug screen was positive for cannabis but not cocaine. 
Methylprednisolone was started and wound care was initiated. Epidermal necrosis then evolved to myonecrosis extending from midthigh to the foot which necessitated below knee amputation of the right extremity.The patient also required allografts to his chest and abdomen and autografts to his face and left lower extremity. 6
Discussion and recommendations.
The presentation of "LINES" is unique and there may be differences in the temporal presentation. Other diagnostic considerations with a similar progression include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) and purpura fulminans (PF). 
Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of "LINES" in patients with skin necrosis, neutropenia and fever associated with cocaine abuse.

Copperhead Road (song)

"Copperhead Road" is the title of a song written and recorded by American country music artist Steve Earle. It was released in 1988 as the lead single and title track from the album "Copperhead Road". The song reached number 10 on the U.S. "Billboard" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and was Earle's highest-peaking song to date on the rock chart in the United States.
Content.
The song's narrator is named John Lee Pettimore, whose father and grandfather were both active in moonshine making and bootlegging in rural Johnson County, Tennessee. Pettimore's grandfather visited town only rarely, in order to buy supplies for a still he had set up in a hollow along Copperhead Road, and he had taken precautions to stop federal agents from finding it or apprehending him. Pettimore's father hauled the moonshine to Knoxville each week, but was killed in an accident during one of these runs.
Pettimore enlists in the Army on his birthday, believing he will soon be drafted ("They draft the white trash first 'round here anyway"), and serves two tours of duty in Vietnam. Once he returns home, he decides to use the Copperhead Road land to grow marijuana, rather than produce moonshine ("I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico"). Having learned a few tricks from the Viet Cong while fighting overseas, he resolves not to be caught by the DEA.
Copperhead Road was an actual road near Mountain City, Tennessee, although it has since been renamed Copperhead Hollow Road, owing to theft of road signs bearing the song's name. The song also inspired a popular line dance, timed to the same beat, and has been used as the theme music for the Discovery Channel reality series "Moonshiners".
Music video.
The music video was directed by Tony Vanden Ende and premiered in early-1988.

Wolverhampton machete attack

The Wolverhampton machete attack occurred at St Luke's Church of England infants' school, on July 8, 1996. While the children were having an outdoor teddy bear picnic, the attacker, 32-year old Horrett Irving Campbell, leapt over a fence and began attacking the children and adults with a machete. Three children and four adults were injured in the attack.
The attack.
Shortly after 3 PM on July 8, 1996, parents and teachers at St. Luke's School were organizing a teddy bear picnic to celebrate the end of the school term. A man described as being in his mid-30s with a slight build who parents saw hanging around the bushes prior to the attack, jumped over a fence surrounding the children's play area and pulled out a large machete. As parents attempted to distract and stop the attacker, he calmly began slashing the machete indiscriminately at the adults and children. Three children and four adults, most notably Lisa Potts, were injured in the attack. Potts was a 21-year old teacher at the school who suffered cuts to her head, back, arms, and one of her arms was almost severed in the attack. A parent chased the man out of the area towards a housing area known as Villiers Flats. Police surrounded the area, and approximately two hours later took away a man who turned out to be someone other than the assailant. On the following day, after hours of searching the area, police arrested 32-year old Horrace Irving Campbell in connection with the attack.
Perpetrator.
Campbell was a 32-year old man who lived across from St. Luke' School in the nearby flats. Neighbors reported that he was unemployed and spent much of his time fixing his Volvo. He had previously been arrested for appearing in public with a machete strapped to his leg, but was not considered to be dangerous. At his trial, psychiatrist Dr. James Collins testified that Campbell was a schizophrenic who believed that the children were talking about him, and that the parents of the children had given information to the police about him. Campbell was also under the delusion that performing this attack would help rid him of a ghost which had haunted him for years. On March 7, 1997, judge Justice Sedley sent Campbell to a mental hospital for an indefinite period. Campbell remains there to this day.
Aftermath.
Potts underwent several surgeries to repair the damage suffered in the attack, and received an initial award of £49,000 by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel, which was increased on November 10, 2001 to £68,000. An award from the panel to the children was eventually increased from £750 to £20,000 each. Potts received the George Medal from Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for her actions in defending the children.

Mister Loveless

Mister Loveless was an American rock band that formed in Walnut Creek, California in 2003. Mister Loveless went through many line-up changes, with Rob I. Miller (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Charlie Koliha (bass guitar) being the only members present through all incarnations. Mister Loveless was named one of the "Top 20 Bay Area Bands of 2011" by San Francisco Bay Area modern rock radio station, Live 105. The band performed alongside noteworthy acts such as Black Francis, The Wedding Present, Beach Fossils, and Thee Oh Sees.
History.
Formation.
Miller and Koliha formed Mister Loveless in high school with several friends. Koliha taught Miller how to play guitar, and Miller began writing songs instantly. When high school friends left for college, Miller and Koliha recruited Ed Melendez to play drums. Sean Gaffney began playing lead guitar based on a particularly intense performance Gaffney had given during a high school talent show. Melendez was eventually replaced with drummer Rachael Travers.
The band is named after Miller's memorably-named sixth grade teacher.
Early Work.
Mister Loveless self-released and self-distributed their debut album, "My Share of Losing" in 2004.
"Two Words" EP" "comprising re-recorded versions of songs that had been released on a San Francisco local bands compilation album, "Rose Hill Volume I" was recorded at Different Fur Studios. The EP accompanied the launch of Mister Loveless' own label: Shady Glen Records. The music from "Two Words" found its way into various skateboarding and snowboarding films, including Corey Duffel's "Strange Notes".
Shortly after the release of "Two Words" EP, Mister Loveless returned to Different Fur studios with Duane Ramos to record “In Wonder”, a near six minute long song the band wanted to do a unique release for. This was released as a 7" single, with "June" as the B-side and "No One Knows" as a free download included with the purchase of the record.
"In Wonder" was used in the end credits of Transworld Skateboarding Film, "Right Foot Forward". (9) This earned the band more support from the skateboarding community and landed them other placement opportunities with Transwolrd Surf, Transworld Snow, and Skullcandy Headphones.
"Three Words" EP.
Following the success of "In Wonder" and "Two Words" EP, Mister Loveless recruited Nick Clark to play drums, who debuted with the band in July 2009, They also began writing material for their "Three Words" EP.
"Three Words" EP was a turning point for the group. It was the follow up to "Two Words" EP in a sense because it elaborated on the number of words in the titles of the songs concept however; it represented a stylistic shift in production and songwriting. The singles, “The Old Pain”, “From Burning Bridges”, and “Strange and Futureless” all charted on Specialty Radio.
The EP earned favorable reviews from "SF Weekly", "Performer Magazine", and various other online music publications.
"Grow Up" and 2012-2013.
With four releases and a handful of tours behind them, Mister Loveless began writing and recording their first full-length album. They recruited Duane M. Ramos, with whom they had already worked on "Three Words", to engineer and produce the album. This time, however, it was recorded entirely in Mister Loveless’s home studio/rehearsal space, Shady Glen Studios located in Miller’s family’s garage in Walnut Creek. Additional mixing and production for the track "Wild Summer" was done by Matt Wallace. The result was the eleven-track album, "Grow Up", which was released on September 11, 2012.
The band recorded a cover of "Blue Christmas" with Meghan Elizabeth in December 2012.
Daniel Brown replaced Gaffney on lead guitar in early 2013. During 2013, Mister Loveless released music videos for their songs "Punk Like Me" and "Curfew." They performed live at MacWorld 2013, SXSW 2013, and BFD 2013. In August 2013, fellow Bay Area band, The Bilinda Butchers, remixed "Curfew."
Disbandment.
On September 19, 2013, it was announced that bass player, Charlie Kolhia, had decided to leave the band. Miller made the decision to end the band entirely, writing, "I can’t do Mister Loveless without Charlie. However, I would be lying if I said I hadn’t begun to feel as though I had outgrown Mister Loveless as well. This band has become like an old jacket. I love it but, it just doesn’t fit right anymore." The group announced their break-up through their Facebook page and a post on their website.
Musical Style.
Mister Loveless incorporated elements of late 1970s post-punk, pioneered by groups such as Joy Division, and late 1980s/early 1990s guitar heavy rock music synonymous with bands like Pixies and Sonic Youth. The group used a collaborative approach to write their songs, while singer/guitarist, Rob Miller wrote the lyrics and vocal melodies. The lyrical content in the band’s songs ranged from forever aging and remembering more youthful days to anxiety ridden, existential crises crippled by indecisiveness.

Quebec general election, 2014

The 41st Quebec general election was held on April 7, 2014 to elect members to the National Assembly of Quebec.
The Quebec Liberal Party under Philippe Couillard won a majority government of 70 seats, while the incumbent Parti Québécois finished second with 30 seats, becoming the first single-term government since Jean-Jacques Bertrand's Union Nationale government was defeated in 1970. It marked the lowest seat total for the Parti Québécois since 1989 and its smallest share of the popular vote since its inaugural run in 1970, as Premier Pauline Marois lost her own riding. The Coalition Avenir Québec under François Legault made minor gains in terms of seats despite receiving a smaller share of the popular vote than in the previous election. Québec solidaire won an additional seat, though co-spokesperson Andrés Fontecilla failed to win his riding.
At the outset of the campaign, the Parti Québécois had a modest lead in the polls and appeared to have a realistic prospect of winning a majority government. However, the party's support began to collapse rapidly after the party announced Pierre Karl Péladeau, the president and CEO of media conglomerate Quebecor, as a star candidate. Péladeau's conservative and anti-union business background was widely criticized as being at odds with the party's social democratic history; and his outspoken support for a third referendum on Quebec sovereignty quickly sidelined the issues — including the Charter of Quebec Values and the corruption allegations against the Liberals, the latter of which had contributed to the defeat of Jean Charest's government in the 2012 election — which the party had identified as its primary campaign themes, alienating many voters who had little desire to revive the sovereignty issue.

Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club

The Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club (RKMC) is a club for firefighters and their families who ride motorcycles. It is the largest fire service Motorcycle Club in the world.
Membership is open to all firefighters; active, retired, volunteer, professional or industrial, who have access to a motorcycle and hold a valid motorcycle driver's license.
History.
During the summer of 1982, several firefighters met in "Randy's Cycle Shop" in Boylston Massachusetts ( USA ). They discussed the fact that police officers had established their own motorcycle club, the "Blue Knights", but there was still no motorcycle club for firefighters. During this discussion, business owner Randy Wilson said to Ed Wright, a firefighter from Northboro (Massachusetts), that he should stop talking about it and establish a motorcycle club.
The idea excited Ed Wright and he went home and made some hand-made cards to invite fire fighters from the region. He planned to organize a meeting to determine whether there was enough interest to start a motorcycle club. On August 17, 1982, Fire Chief Jack Pierce allowed a small group of avid motorcycle riding firefighters to meet in the headquarters of the Fire Department for the purpose of starting a motorcycle club.
On October 19, 1982, firefighters Colin Mackey, Bob Bourassa, Ed Wright, Roger Wentzell, Dave Hamilton, Bob Goulet, David Hunt, Jon Tripp, Don Parker, Norm Beausoleil and Fire Chief Jack Pierce met again. It was decided that the club would be called the "Red Knights Motorcycle Club" and the first Chapter would be Massachusetts 1.
In July 1983, a Chapter was founded in Connecticut. In October of that year, a second chapter in Massachusetts was founded. Soon there were startups in remote locations, such as Nevada and Louisiana. In August 1983, the founding members realized that the organization had quickly exceeded their original expectations. To properly handle this growth they elected a board of directors, the "National Board of Directors" . With the founding of chapters in Ontario and Saskatchewan, the club was the renamed the "Red Knights International Firefighters Motorcycle Club".
There are now 350 chapters and over 9,500 members worldwide.

Cyclotruncated 6-simplex honeycomb

In six-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the cyclotruncated 6-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 6-simplex, truncated 6-simplex, bitruncated 6-simplex, and tritruncated 6-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.
It can be constructed by seven sets of parallel hyperplanes that divide space. The hyperplane intersections generate cyclotruncated 5-simplex honeycomb divisions on each hyperplane.

Lim Chi-jung

Lim Chi Jung (임치정; 林蚩正), (September 26, 1880 – January 9, 1932), was a Korean independence activist and supporter of the Korean Independence Movement.
Biography.
Early life.
Born in 1880 in the region of Pyong Aang Nam-Do, Korea, Lim received 7–8 years of education before leaving school in 1900. Three years later, at the age of 23, Lim traveled to Oahu, Hawaii to work as a labourer. In Hawaii he worked on a plantation and educated himself in his spare time. It was during this period that Lim developed nationalistic sentiments.
By 1904, Lim had moved to San Francisco where he began learning English formally. While a student, he met Ahn Chang-ho, a Korean independence activist and one of the early leaders of the Korean-American immigrant community in the United States.
Participation of the Korean Independence movement in the U.S..
At the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan invaded and colonized Korea. Horrified that their country's sovereignty was under threat, Lim, Ahn, and other like-minded Koreans formed a group which later became the New People's Association, a clandestine organization whose aim was to foster the independence and national strength of the Korean Empire, by promoting national feeling among Koreans and Korean-Americans living in America. The New People's Association also served as the unofficial Korean consulate in America while Korea was under Japanese ruke.
In November 1905, Korea was pressured into signing the Eulsa Treaty, which handed full control of the Korean peninsula to Japan. Following this, Lim and others formed a nationalist newspaper called Gong-lib Shinbo, of which Lim was chief administrator, to campaign for their country and to promote national pride. Japan viewed the activities of Lim's organisations with disfavour, but werfe unable to taken any action on American soil.
Lim was also a leader in Shinminhoe, a Korean-American immigrant community group (신민회), and served as secretary for The Korea Daily News [대한매일신보(大韓每日申報)].
Korean Independence Movement.
In 1906, Ahn Chang-ho returned to Korea, bringing the New People's Association with him. Lim followed in 1907. They established bases in first in Pyongyang and Seoul, then nationwide. They supported education, industrialization, and military action for independence.
:105-Man Incident.
In 1910, Lim was implicated after an attempt was made to assassinate Masatake Terauchi, the Governor-General of Korea (Chôsen Sôtoku). A young Korean man named An Myeong-Gun, was alleged to have attempted to shoot Terauchi at Suncheon Station. An was a cousin of An Jung-geun buddah, a Korean independence activist who assassinated Itō Hirobumi (伊藤博文), the first Prime Minister of Japan and then-Japanese Resident-General of Korea in 1906. The event would later become known as the Suncheon Incident or the 105 Man Incidents.
After the failed attempt, the Governor-General arrested over 700 Koreans. In 1912, 122 were tried, and 105 sentenced to imprisonment with hard labor. In the end, only six Koreans had their sentences imposed, and even they were amnestied in 1915.
It has been claimed that the plot was fabricated by the Japanese authorities to weaken and discredit the Korean independence movement. Certainly, after the failed attempt to assassinate Terauchi, the New People's Association came under close scrutiny. After Lim and other key members of the New People's Association were captured, the organization was disbanded.
March 1st Movement.
In February 1919, after two Korean independence fighters - Jung Shung Kyong and Lee Sung Hun – were jailed, Lim and other members of the New People's Association set about planning a mass protest against Japanese occupation. The March 1st Movement, or Samil Movement, was one of the earliest public displays of Korean resistance during the Japanese occupation of Korea. On March 1, 1919, Lim's comrades began their four-week long protest in Nampho, North Korea. The campaign was violent and many of the protesters were jailed, but there was a major shift in Japanese imperial policy towards Korea. Although Lim was not directly involved in the protest, he was recognized as one of its architects.
Death and Legacy.
In 1923, in order to continue the Korean Independence Movement, Lim and his fellow activists established another nationalist newspaper Shi Dae Ilbo.
Lim retired in 1928 and the newspaper stopped publishing due to internal conflicts and pressure from the Japanese. Lim's dedication to the Korean Independence Movement had begun to take a toll on his health. He became distressed by Japan's stranglehold over his country, and the inability of the Korean Independence Movement to loosen it. He turned to alcohol as a way of coping with the pain and stress.
On January 100, 1932, Lim died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Seodaemun, Seoul.
In 1968, the Korean government officially recognized Lim's efforts for the Korean Independence Movement by awarding him with the Order of Merit for National Foundation in the grade of Dongnip Jang (독립장; "Order of Independence").
In January 2007, Korea's Ministry of Patriots' and Veterans' Affairs, (South Korea) further recognized Lim's achievement by presenting him as an Independence Movement Fighter of the Month.

United States Senate election in Arizona, 1952

The 1952 United States Senate election in Arizona was held on November 4, 1952. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator and Senate Majority Leader Ernest McFarland ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by the Republican nominee and future candidate for President of the United States, Barry Goldwater.
Goldwater ran an aggressive campaign against the entrenched Democrat, accumulating over fifty thousand air-miles in his travels about the state, during which he delivered more than six hundred speeches. He defeated McFarland in the general election by a slim margin of 6,725 votes out of approximately 260,000 cast, which Goldwater attributed in part to the unpopularity of President Harry S. Truman and the backing of popular Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy. Goldwater also launched a get out the vote effort in the northern part of the state, knowing the margin of victory would be slim, and received support from Republican Party campaign organizations and several prominent party members.
The election marked the end of the Senate career of Ernest McFarland, who was first elected in 1940 and had served as co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Navajo-Hopi Indian Administration in addition to Senate Majority Leader. He was later elected Governor of Arizona in 1954 and ran unsuccessfully for his former Senate seat in 1958.
Campaign.
After becoming a member of the Phoenix City Council in 1949, Barry Goldwater assumed a position as campaign manager of fellow Republican John Howard Pyle's successful 1950 bid for Governor of Arizona. After Pyle's narrow victory in the 1950 election, Goldwater began exploring the possibility of running for higher office himself and won re-election to his seat on the Phoenix Council by a comfortable margin. Goldwater's interest compounded in 1951, the same year he won re-election to his council seat, when Illinois U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen visited Phoenix. Goldwater, while at a cocktail party for Dirksen, was approached by the Illinois Senator, who encouraged him to run for Incumbent Democratic Senator Ernest McFarland's seat. Goldwater said later that he had estimated his chances at winning the election to be fifteen-to-one. Nonetheless, Goldwater began conducting research on McFarland and studied the election returns of Howard Pyle's 1950 gubernatorial victory, leading him to re-estimate his chances to be fifty-fifty.
Goldwater had been campaigning for several months before formally announcing his candidacy for McFarland's U.S. Senate seat on April 24, 1952. In his formal announcement, Goldwater cited six reasons for his entering the Senate race: his belief "that a life-long familiarity with the State of Arizona and its people and intensive study of the problems and needs of this region as a businessman and citizen qualifies me to represent efficiently our state in Washington," his opposition to the expansion of the federal government and belief in states' rights, his opposition to the New Deal and Fair Deal programs, his belief that a U.S. Senator should not be "a mere rubber stamp for any administration," and his opposition to the "present tragic trend toward the destruction of individual freedom."
The divisive race between Dwight Eisenhower and Robert Taft for the Republican nomination in the 1952 presidential race became cause for concern for state Republicans, Goldwater in particular. He confided to an associate of the Republican National Committee, Clarence Buddington Kelland, that he believed the Democrats were beginning to benefit from the "constant bickering" within the party. This, believed Goldwater, was the best-case scenario for the Democrats, including McFarland, who was hindered in his bid for re-election by the missteps of the then-unpopular Truman administration.
Originally believing he could run a campaign on his own with relatively few resources, Goldwater hired a campaign manager in June 1952, Stephen Shadegg, who had previously worked on the campaign of Democratic U.S. Senator Carl Hayden. Goldwater also received financial and logistical help from the Republican National Committee and the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. Goldwater also received financial backing from prominent Republicans, including Sid Richardson and H. L. Hunt and easily defeated his sole opponent, Lester Kahl, in the Republican primary on September 8. Goldwater employed a general election strategy of focusing get out the vote efforts on the three northernmost counties of Arizona, inhabited primarily by the Navajo and Hopi Native American peoples. Feeling the margin would be close in the election results, Goldwater believed these efforts, especially efforts to organize a voter registration campaign in the northern counties, to be crucial for victory, writing to Everett Dirksen in May that "this might well be the margin of victory in this state."
Results.
On Election Day, November 4, 1952, Barry Goldwater defeated incumbent Ernest McFarland by a slim margin, winning by 6,725 out of approximately 260,000 votes cast, becoming the first Republican to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate since 1920. Goldwater, writing to Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy, said of the results, "The election victory was not entirely a surprise, because we knew that McFarland, carrying the weight of Truman's mistakes around his neck, would have a difficult time winning, particularly in view of the fact that I had spent nearly all of my life campaigning for this job, whether I realized it or not."

Mam Sonando

Mam Sonando (; born February 13, 1942) is a Cambodian radio journalist with French dual citizenship. He is the owner and director of Phnom Penh's Beehive Radio, which the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) described in 2012 as "one of Cambodia's few independent news outlets". He also acts as a political commentator for the station. 
Sonando has been imprisoned three times on charges related to his reporting: a 2003 arrest for "inciting riots", a 2005 arrest for defamation, and a 2012 arrest for insurrection. His twenty-year prison sentence for the latter was protested by human rights groups, and US President Barack Obama expressed concerns about the case in a meeting with Prime Minister Hun Sen. The sentence was overturned by an appeals court in March 2013, and Sonando was instead given a five-year suspended sentence on charges of causing civil unrest.
Biography.
Mam Sonando was born on February 13, 1942 in a small district called Kampong Siem in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia. His father, Mam Soth, was a lawyer. His mother Eam Ouch was born in Battambang province. Sonando traveled to Paris in 1964 for school. He attended the Vaugirard State Technical College of Photography and Cinematography, in Paris, France, from 1969 to 1970. In 1973, he received a Bachelor's Degree with major in sociology and cinematography and audio visuals, at the Paris XV University. 
He left Cambodia again in 1975 to avoid the rule of the Khmer Rouge, remaining in France until 1993. That year, he returned to Cambodia and acquired a broadcasting license for a new station which he named Beehive Radio. He used the station to advertise a new political party, the Beehive Democratic Society Party, and stood in the 1998 parliamentary election. According to the "Asia Times", his campaign only won him "a reputation as an eccentric, spouting Buddhist philosophy, pleas for democracy and a personal campaign for attention." After failing to be elected, Sonando dissolved his party, but continued broadcasting on Beehive Radio as an independent journalist.
Sonando is the owner and director of Beehive Radio. In 2012, Human Rights Watch described Beehive Radio as "a key platform for promotion of human rights and democracy in Cambodia". The station is one of the few to address controversial topics, including "Cambodian civil society, the fight against HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality and human trafficking, campaigns for women's rights and gender equality, political and economic transparency, equitable and sustainable development, labor rights, environmental protection, the rule of law, and electoral education and election monitoring." It also carries programming by Radio Free Asia, Voice of America, the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, and Radio France Internationale.
The station is funded by a combination of advertising and private donations. Some companies have declined to advertise with Beehive Radio due to its occasionally controversial reporting and political stances. Sonando also refuses to run advertisements for "vice" products, including cigarettes.
2003 arrest.
In January 2003, riots broke out in Phnom Penh after a Cambodian newspaper incorrectly reported that a Thai actress had stated Angkor Wat properly belonged to Thailand. On 29 January, the Thai embassy was burned, and hundreds of Thai immigrants fled the country to avoid the violence. During the riots, a caller to Beehive Radio claimed incorrectly that Cambodian embassy officials were killed in Bangkok. On 31 January, Sonando was arrested and accused of "relaying false information", "inciting discrimination", and "inciting crime". He stated to reporters, "They blame me for broadcasting an opinion of a listener which turned out to be untrue. But if I have to go to jail to allow people to express their opinion I am happy."
Sonando was formally charged in court on 1 February; ten days later, he was released on bail. The charges never came to trial.
2005 arrest.
Sonando was arrested again on 11 October 2005 after reporting on Prime Minister Hun Sen's treaty with Vietnam settling the two nations' border dispute; the report included a discussion with a French-based expert who criticized Hun Sen's concessions. Sonando was charged with "criminal defamation", "disseminating false information", and "incitement". On 3 November, he was denied bail.
Sonando's arrest was criticized by the United Nations and the European Union. A coalition of 70 Cambodian civil society organizations also pushed for his release. CPJ condemned the arrest as part of a "broad crackdown on freedom of expression", and Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience.
In late January 2006, Sonando was granted bail ahead of a visit by US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill. Hun Sen described the release as a "gift" to the visitor. The charges against Sonando were dropped before the end of the month.
2012 arrest.
In mid-2012, Beehive Radio reported on an International Court of Justice complaint against Prime Minister Hun Sen blaming him for the 2010 Phnom Penh stampede, in which 347 people were killed. The report sparked a new series of disputes between Sonando and Hun Sen. On 26 June 2012, Hun Sen called for Sonando's arrest while Sonando was out of the country, accusing him of heading a separatist plot in Kratié Province to break it away from the rest of the nation. From 15 to 17 May, the province had been the site of a protest against evictions for a new rubber plant that residents accused of "land-grabbing". On the final day of the protests, soldiers opened fire on a crowd of families, killing a 14-year-old girl. Though Sonando returned during the 2012 ASEAN meeting, he was not arrested until 15 July, a few days after its end. 
Hun Sen accused Sonando of attempting to create a "state within a state", and Sonando was formally charged with "insurrection" and "inciting people to take up weapons against state". The charges carried a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. Secessionist charges were also brought against several community activists from the province.
According to Ou Virak of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, Sonando was then imprisoned in a cell shared with 17 other people, leaving him "half a square meter square feet to sleep in". On 22 July, he was moved to a prison hospital on account of illness.
Sonando's arrest quickly generated domestic and international criticism. A coalition of 22 Cambodian rights groups, known as the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee, called on the government to free Sonando "to save the country's reputation". Members of Beehive Radio and the Association of Democrats protested in front of Phnom Penh's royal palace on 23 July.
CPJ called for Sonado's immediate release, stating that Hun Sen had "a well-worn history of leveling unsubstantiated anti-state charges against journalists to stifle criticism of the administration." Human Rights Watch said that "Sonando's arrest on the heels of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's visit is a brazen signal that Hun Sen thinks that the US wants his cooperation on other matters so much that he isn't afraid to lower the boom on his critics". Amnesty International again named Sonando a prisoner of conscience, "held for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression". The International Federation for Human Rights and the World Organisation Against Torture issued a joint statement noting that they were "gravely concerned" about the charges and calling for Sonando's immediate release. Reporters Without Borders described the arrest as "like a parting slap to all those who attended last week's ASEAN summit in Phnom Penh. As soon the diplomats leave, the authorities arrest dissidents." The Ireland-based NGO Front Line Defenders included him on the short list for its 2013 Human Rights Defender at Risk award.
On 1 October 2012, Sonando was found guilty by a Phnom Penh court. He was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment and fined 10 million riel (US$2,500). In November, US President Barack Obama raised concerns about the case during a meeting with Hun Sen. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also called for Sonando to be released.
An appeals court overturned Sonando's conviction on anti-state charges on 14 March 2013, finding that there had been no evidence to convict him. The court instead gave Sonando a five-year suspended sentence on charges that he had been involved in the Kratié unrest. A crowd of hundreds of Sonando supporters gathered outside the courthouse to hear the verdict. Amnesty International called the ruling "a positive step for freedom of expression in the country", but added that "Mam Sonando should never have been imprisoned in the first place, and the convictions that stand appear baseless." Sonando was released from prison on 15 March, the day after the ruling. Following his release, Sonando stated his intention to clear his name of the remaining charges.
2014 protest.
In January 2014, Mam Sonando organized a mass demonstration, which demanded the government to expand his radio reach and open a TV station. The Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith denied the permission for the expansion but Mam Sonando told reporters the denial is unconstitutional. Protesters clashed with police on January 28, injuring at least 9 of the demonstrators. In response to the violence, Human Rights Watch calls for the United Nations to pressure the Cambodian government. Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House have also condemned the violence.
Personal life.
Sonando is married to Den Phanara. He is a devout Buddhist who constructed a Buddhist temple beside his radio station, and is an avid fan of jazz.

The Mercer Cluster

"The Mercer Cluster" is the official bi-weekly student newspaper and news site of Mercer University, published in print every other Thursday and online seven days a week during the school year. While production and distribution of The Cluster's print edition is subsidized by Mercer's administration, the paper retains full editorial autonomy as a student publication under the University's bylaws, and receives no monetary subsidies for its digital products. Its staff is composed entirely of students, with the exception of a faculty advisor who serves in a consulting role.
Origins.
Students started publishing The Cluster in 1920. The paper received its name from a book of hymns penned by Mercer University founder and prominent Baptist minister Jesse Mercer in 1810, entitled "Cluster of Spiritual Songs." Former Cluster contributors include longtime Atlanta publisher Jack Tarver, former U.S. attorney general Griffin B. Bell, attorney and author Robert Steed, novelist and physician Ferrol Sams and Atlanta Journal-Constitution editor J. Reginald Murphy. For most of its history, The Cluster has been the only newspaper published by students of Mercer University. In 1971, a group of students began publishing "Mercer Today" as an alternative to The Cluster, but the operation folded in 1977.
Controversies.
In October 2005, The Cluster ran an opinions piece and full-page advertisement in support of a pro-LGBT student organization's first annual "Coming Out Day". News of the event sparked a month-long dispute between University president R. Kirby Godsey and the Georgia Baptist Convention, eventually leading the religious group to sever its 170-year-old ties and multi-million dollar endowment to the University out of a concern that Mercer had, as a report by CNN put it, become "more liberal than its Southern Baptist roots" Since the split, Mercer has chosen to be no longer formally religiously affiliated.
Present-day operations.
In 2011, The Cluster launched its online edition in an effort to broaden its reach to students and the surrounding community, appointing senior Carl V. Lewis as its first digital editor. In the fall of 2011, the paper also added a new "Local" section in an additional push to broaden its geographic reach to the increasingly gentrified neighborhoods that compose the surrounding College Hill Corridor area.
Despite its growing focus on its digital operations, The Cluster maintains an estimated print circulation of around 1,500 copies, which are distributed for free throughout the University's main campus as well as downtown Macon businesses.

New Horizons (Flyleaf album)

New Horizons is the third full-length studio album by American rock band Flyleaf, released on A&M/Octone Records on October 30, 2012. It was produced by Howard Benson, who has produced several of Flyleaf's previous recordings. It is the final album with lead vocalist Lacey Sturm, who announced her departure from the band, just prior to the album's release, in October 2012.
Production.
It was announced in February 2012 that Flyleaf had entered the studio with producer Howard Benson to start recording a new full-length studio album. A release date of October 30, 2012 was eventually confirmed for the album.
Singles.
"New Horizons" is the album's first single and was released via iTunes on August 21. However, the song made its radio debut on Windsor, Ontario rock station 89X on August 1. According to bassist Pat Seals, the song is about "a feeling of looking toward the unknown future with hope." Seals also described it as one of the band's best songs to date. A video was made for the song, and it was subsequently released on September 4, 2012. A second single, "Call You Out", was released later that month. Of the song, Seals said " was one of the first songs written during the New Horizons sessions. The stomping opening verse evolved over time into this aggressive but very calculated track that closes with Sameer using chaotic guitar sounds to sort of burn it to the ground - engages you all the way through."
