Innovative Users Group

__NOTOC__
The Innovative Users Group, often abbreviated as "IUG", is an independent organization of libraries who use Innovative Interfaces, Inc.'s integrated library system software. According to its bylaws, the IUG's purpose is to:
Activities and services.
Annual conference.
The IUG hosts a three-day conference (plus a one-day pre-conference) every spring. Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the sessions are presented by speakers from IUG member institutions, with the remainder being held by presenters from Innovative Interfaces. The sessions vary in nature and scope, from structured "how-to" sessions to open forums at which members share ideas and information about whatever is on their minds.
The conference moves around from year to year, alternating between sites in the San Francisco Bay Area and other locations throughout the United States. Past locations have included Boston, Washington, D.C., Houston and Philadelphia. The 2010 conference will be held in Chicago.
Enhancements.
Due to the diverse natures of the libraries using Innovative's software, and the rapid development of other computing technologies, there is an ongoing flow of requests for enhancements and upgrades to the various pieces of software Innovative sells. In order to keep this flow of requests manageable, the IUG has set up a process for submitting, evaluating and prioritizing desired enhancements, then submitting these requests to Innovative. In turn, Innovative makes a point of trying to incorporate enhancements from the IUG in their release upgrades.

Indian Harbour, Nova Scotia

Indian Harbour is a small fishing community of the Halifax Regional Municipality in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia on the Chebucto Peninsula. It is located between the communities of Peggy's Cove and Hackett's Cove.
Indian Harbour also refers to a bay on the east coast of Nova Scotia, Guysborough county, District of St Mary's,Coordinates 45.095004,-61.827714.
The town associated with this bay was once also named Indian Harbour and was renamed Port Hilford.
History.
Indian Harbour was founded in the early 18th century. The first recorded person to live in Indian Harbour was John Ormsby in 1784. The first and the oldest house in Indian Harbour is still standing today at over 250 years old.
Indian Harbour is located next to the popular tourist destination Peggy's Cove and its famous lighthouse. There is also a lighthouse in Indian Harbour, located at the end of Paddy's Head Peninsula. The lighthouse was built in 1901 and manned until 1945, when power was introduced to the area.
Indian Harbour's roads were dirt and had to be up kept by the locals until 1955 when Route 333 was widened and paved.
In recent years one of Canada's biggest air disasters took place over the Atlantic Ocean near St. Margarets Bay. On September 2, 1998, Swissair Flight 111 crashed just off the coast; all 229 people on board died. Today when people come to visit Indian Harbour or Peggy's Cove they pass the Swissair Flight 111 Memorial.
Nova Scotian singer Anne Murray used to own a beach in Indian Harbour, on the Paddy's Head Peninsula, and used to let the public use the beach, but she sold it in 1999.
Schools.
Indian Harbour has had three schools in its history. The first school was built in 1878 and is said to have burnt down; it was located on the Government Wharf Road, 50 yards from the Baptist church. In 1891 the second school was built where East St. Margaret's Elementary currently stands. This school served the communities of Hackett's Cove, Indian Harbour and Peggy's Cove. On November 18, 1958, East St Margaret's Elementary School opened its doors. The school served grades primary to twelve; in 1966 the grades were reduced to primary to eight; when Tantallon Junior High opened in 1972, the grades were reduced to primary to six. Today East St. Margaret's is still serving Indian Harbour. The school has room for 198 students but only had 55 students for the 2009-2010 school year.
Transit.
Currently there are no buses running from Halifax to Indian Harbour; the closest bus route is in Tantallon where the "Metro X" buses run several times a day.
Television.
Indian Harbour gets all of the local television from Halifax. The following television stations air in St. Margarets Bay:
CBC Nova Scotia (CBHT)
CTV Maritimes (CJCH)
Global Maritimes
Local business.
Local businesses include the Rhubarb Grill & Café, the Harbourside Restaurant (formerly Tea and Treasures), the King Neptune Campground, the Oceanstone Inn and Cottages, and the Clifty Cove Motel. Indian Harbour only has one store, the Whale's Back; locals call it "the store". The Whale's Back serves people from West Dover to Glen Haven and tourists in the summer; it has the same owners as the Sou' Wester Restaurant & Giftshop in Peggy's Cove.

Saint Basil Academy (Garrison, New York)

Saint Basil Academy is a residential school for at-risk students run by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America in Garrison, New York, United States. It is located at Eagle's Rest, previously the estate of Jacob Ruppert, owner of the New York Yankees in the early 20th century, between NY 9D and the Hudson River.
During Ruppert's lifetime many Yankees players, including Babe Ruth, were frequent visitors. After his death, the estate remained vacant until 1944, when Archbishop Athenagoras acquired the property for the church and founded the school. In 1982 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in recognition of both Ruppert's historical importance and its well-preserved early Twentieth-century architecture.
History.
As estate.
The property was part of a large tract granted to local landowner Philip Philipse in 1686 by the British Crown. His son Frederick left to his daughter Mary Gouverneur in 1829, and she ultimately divided it three ways, taking the northern third and naming it Eagles' Rest. That portion was eventually sold to Louis Fitzgerald, a local businessman who served as an officer in the Union Army during the Civil War.
His three daughters in turn sold the estate to Ruppert, who had made a fortune in his family's brewing business, served in Congress and bought the Yankees, 11 years later, in 1919. He commenced major building on the property in the early 1920s, tearing down the original mansion for the current Tudorbethan structure, which was finished in 1928.
The Yankees and their "Murderers' Row" became champions under Ruppert's ownership, and many players were guests at the estate. Babe Ruth reportedly signed one of his most lucrative contracts there. The brewing business had also survived Prohibition by making near beer, and since real estate had become cheap after the Crash of 1929, Ruppert began expanding it, acquiring the land between the old and new alignments of NY 9D when the road was relocated east to its present route. In these buildings he kept a small personal zoo, with one of the largest collections of monkeys, wild birds and peacocks in the world at the time. In the mansion he had a collection of furniture, pottery, jade and Chinese porcelains. The estate employed 40 people.
Construction continued through Ruppert's death in 1939, with smaller outbuildings added, bringing the estate to a total of 26 buildings. Many of these are considered contributing resources to the NRHP listing.
As school.
After five years of vacancy, the Greek Orthodox Ladies Philoptochos Society bought the property in 1944 for $55,000 ($ in 2008 dollars). Property taxes were increasing on large estates, and as a nonprofit the church was exempt. At first, it was coeducational, but soon it was decided to limit admission to girls due to the limited space available (only six buildings were usable then).
In addition to its secondary program, the academy was also, at first, a women's junior college, offering a three-year teacher training program, and an orphanage. Graduates went on to work for the church as teachers or secretaries. Later in the 1950s, the school decided to admit boys again, and in 1959 a former stable had been converted into a boys' dormitory.
The American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA), which had raised money for the stable conversion, continued its efforts and built a new classroom building, just north of the mansion, which opened in 1962. The Pan-Arcadian Fraternal Association built a new gymnasium that doubled as an auditorium the next year, inspiring Archbishop Iakovos to call for money for more new dorms.
This period of growth would lead to a slight contraction in the 1970s. In 1973 the junior college and its programs merged with Hellenic College in Brookline, Massachusetts. Three years later, in 1976, the Philoptochos sold the of marshland along the Hudson River to the Audubon Society, which has made it their Constitution Island Sanctuary for the protection of some of the river's bird species.
Building began anew with a library in 1981 and swimming pool (later enclosed) five years later, in 1986. Architect William Chirgotis designed and funded a new chapel in memory of his parents, in 1985. A playground was built with donated money in 1990, and in 1999 a medical and dental facility. Maintenance and renovation projects continue around campus as educational programs for students.

Neoantigenic determinant

An antigen is a foreign substance which is capable of inducing the production of specific antibodies, which react specifically in the body .
A Protein can undergo further modification within a biochemical pathway such as glycosylation, phosphorylation or proteolysis. This, by altering the structure of the protein, can produce new epitopes which are called neoantigenic determinants as they give rise to new (lat. neo) antigenic determinants and require separate, specific antibodies for recognition.

Sam (koala)

Sam (died 6 August 2009), also known as Sam the Koala, was a female koala from the forests of Mirboo North, Victoria, Australia. She became publicly known when a video and photographs of her being rescued by a firefighter were distributed on the internet and through the media during the aftermath of the Black Saturday bushfires.
Initial encounter.
A mobile phone video of the event, which attracted just over 1.4 million hits on YouTube, shows firefighter David Tree approaching Sam who initially attempts to flee but then stops—Tree later speculated that the koala had been thinking "I can't run, I'm weak and sore, put me out of my misery"—and Tree calls for water. Sam is then shown drinking from a bottle he is holding for her. She is also seen allowing herself to be patted, and holding her paw on his hand. Sam became a symbol of hope.
It was initially thought that Sam had been rescued by Tree following the February 2009 Victorian bushfires; however, the event actually occurred in the week before the worst of the fires, during backburning operations initiated by firefighters. Tree and his crew came across Sam when they were blacking out (making sure a that a contained or checked fire does not restart) after the fires had gone through. The video was recorded by Tree and other firefighters; it had been intended for Tree's daughter.
Treatment.
Sam was subsequently taken to the Southern Ash Wildlife Centre in Rawson where she was found to be suffering from second-degree burns to her paws and given painkillers. Caretakers at the shelter expected that it would take her about eight months to recover. Based on the condition of her teeth, the shelter manager estimated her to be between two and four years old. She was placed with a male koala named Bob, who had been rescued from another of the bushfire areas two days earlier and was suffering from third-degree burns.
Subsequent events.
Sam's story was featured in media outlets worldwide, including "The New York Times" and CNN. Gossip site TMZ.com mocked the rescue, calling Sam "pampered"; this drew significant reader backlash and attention. TMZ later apologised to Sam.
Sam was euthanised on 6 August 2009. The decision was made after exploratory surgery on her urinary bladder and uterus to evaluate the possible removal of cysts caused by urogenital chlamydiosis. As her condition was inoperable the veterinarian stated that the decision was made to euthanise to prevent her suffering. Sam's remains were moved to Melbourne Museum where they were preserved as a symbol of the bushfires.
Related products.
An image of Sam with David Tree was used as cover art on a fundraising CD, "Bushfire Aid", to which 35 national and international artists donated songs. All proceeds were donated to the Salvation Army Bushfire Appeal. A total of A$300,000 was also raised for the Country Fire Authority and other charities through selling photographs of Sam's rescue.
In February 2009, an application was made to register the words "Sam the Koala" as a trademark for chocolates
and in August 2009 media reported a dispute.
Trademark dispute.
On 20 February 2009 and 13 March 2009, an application was made to register the words "Sam the Koala" as a trademark in Class 30 (for chocolates) and as a trademark in Class 16 (for colouring-in books). The applications were approved for Acceptance of Registration of a Trademark on 25 June 2009 and 16 July 2009 respectively. An opposition notice was lodged by DSE in September 2009 and that opposition outcome is still pending a final decision by IPAustralia. Media published the trademark applications which led to a dispute called an 'Opposition Notice'.
On 27 July 2010 the DSE applied for a new trademark TM1374402, "Sam The Koala", in Class32 (beverages), Class33 (alcoholic beverages), Class41 (education, training and cultural activities), Class43 (services for providing food and drink), and Class44 (veterinary services and hygienic and beauty care for animals), however DSE Application TM1374402 was issued an "Adverse Report1" on 27 August 2010.

Causeway GAA

The village of Causeway is situated roughly 15 miles north of Tralee, 6 miles east of Ballyheigue and 6 miles west of Ballyduff. Without question, Hurling is the sport of choice for the majority of the community. In the football-obsessed county of Kerry, hurling takes precedence in the north of the county, and Causeway G.A.A. Club is at the centre of this hurling stronghold. Notably, Causeway is the home club of Neilus Flynn, whom the current Kerry County Senior Hurling Championship Trophy is named after.
Club history.
Early records indicate that Causeway fielded teams sporadically around the late 19th and early 20th century. Causeway first entered the County Senior Hurling championship in 1892. Causeway's first County Championship success came in 1932. Led by the Legendary Neilus Flynn, Causeway defeated Kilflynn, Kenmare, Kilgarvan and Rathmore on their way to the title. In fact, the aforementioned Neilus Flynn had the honour of captaining two different teams to Championship success; Causeway in 1932, and St Brendans in 1936. He also captained a Shannon Rovers amalgamation in the 1939 County Final defeat to Crotta.
In the early years, training and games were held at the Fair Green and Sandford Lawn to the east of the Village, Diggins' field in Drumnacurra, Lyons' in Meenogahane and Flynns' in Foxfort. Another interesting aspect is that up to the mid-30's Causeway played in Black & Amber and Blue & Gold Jerseys. The Maroon jersey arrived on the scene when Gaelinn presented the parish with a set of jerseys as reward for the selling of tickets around the parish and at the carnivals held at the time.
An important development occurred in the mid-70's with the acquirement of a Sportsfield. Causeway G.A.A. club entered into agreement with Causeway Comprehensive School and Kerry V.E.C. and developed a field, bought from the late Bart Costello, to the south of village. Causeway G.A.A club now had a place they could call "Home". 
Following a County Final defeat to Ballyduff the previous year, Causeway finally re-gained the coveted title of County Champions in 1979. Crotta were defeated in one of the most dramatic County Finals ever with a last minute goal from Ger Clifford, enabling Roger Hussey to become the 1st Causeway man since Neilus Flynn to lift the County Championship trophy. This win was the start of the great four in row team that achieved further success in 1980, 1981 and 1982. Roy Dineen in 1980, Maurice Leahy in 1981 and Gerald O'Grady in 1982 were the men who led Causeway to victory.
A centenary final defeat to Ballyduff in 1984 was followed by another county title in 1987. This was a very poignant day for the club as it was the first year that the new Neilus Flynn Trophy was being played for. Sadly in August of that year Neilus died but his memory and name will forever be associated with hurling in Kerry thanks to the magnificent trophy donated by the Flynn Families of Drumnacurra and Foxfort. The club paid him the ultimate tribute by winning the trophy in its premier year and Anthony O'Connor had the honour of hoisting it aloft. 1984 saw the commencement of work on the dressing-rooms which also led to the building of a handball alley, scoreboard and Stand. Then in June 1988 amid great Fanfare, Causeway G.A.A. club proudly opened their facilities.
In the Mid-nineties a strong emphasis was placed on the youth of the parish and today Causeway has one of the Strongest Under-age set-ups in the county. The decade finished on a high for the club with a Co Final appearance in 1997 followed by victory in the '98 decider. After a gap of 11 years a Maurice O'Carroll led Causeway defeated Crotta in a repeat of the '79 final. In 1999 Causeway U-16's won the Club All-Ireland Shield held in Carlow.
While Causeway players have figured prominently with successful school & county teams other notable achievements which the club are proud of include Pat Moriarty, D.J. Leahy and Michael Burke representing Munster with D.J. winning a Railway Cup medal in 1985. Pat Moriaty is the sole Kerry hurler to ever be nominated for a Senior Intercounty Championship All-Star and that honour was bestowed on him in 1977. Tadgh Flynn was selected on the Fitzgibbon Team of the Year in 2005 following his achievements as the first-choice goalkeeper with the University of Limerick Fitzgibbon Cup Team. John Mike Dooley has represented Ireland twice in the Senior Shinty series in 2004 & 2005. He has also won the GPA player of the month for Feb '05 and he became the 1st Kerry Hurler to receive a Christy Ring All-Star in 2005.
While there were Senior County Championship Final defeats in 2004 and 2006 there is still a fantastic optimism and community spirit about the club. The current team is one of the youngest in terms of average age, ever seen at the club. As a result there are great expectations of success for the years to come.

Lovecraft, The Ushers, Mother O, Shadows of Memory, The Last Romantics, Cathedral of Ice, The House on F Street and others. He received a literary award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters for his plays. He also wrote the libretto for James Rosen's opera, Emperor Norton. 
He was visiting Freiburg, Germany in 1938 when the Kristallnacht riots occurred, and the experience led him into writing and poetry. Other seminal experiences came from his own family background, travel, and during his Army service. He was influenced by his father, Rudolph Schevill, who created and chaired the department of romance languages at UC Berkeley, and created the West Coast committee in defense of the Spanish republic at the request of his friends Pablo Casals and Fernando de los Rios. His mother Margaret Schevill, was an artist, a scholar of Navaho culture and mythology, and a follower of Carl Jung. As a German speaker, he worked for military intelligence and was assigned to a prisoner of war camp where, despite the denazification program, he saw that Nazis dominated other prisoners, as he described in his novel Cathedral of Ants (1976). 
In a 1950 letter to Robert Sproul, the president of the University of California, he refused to sign a loyalty oath, at the time a prerequisite to becoming an instructor at the UC Berkeley. Instead he went on to teach at California College of Arts and Crafts, San Francisco State University, where he headed the Poetry Center, and at Brown University until his retirement.
In 1968, he signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. 
In 1981 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship in Drama and Performance Art. His contributions to the theater began with his strong involvement in the Actors Workshop in San Francisco, and his founding of Wastepaper Theater at Brown University as well as his collaborations with Trinity Reporatory Theater in Providence. He suffered a severe stroke in 1999 which made him a wheelchair user. He died in Berkeley, California in January 2009.

Eli Bard

Eli Bard (born Eliphas) is a fictional character, a comic book supervillain from the Marvel Comics universe. He is a member of the Purifiers and an enemy of the X-Men.
Fictional character biography.
Eli Bard's back story was told, through a flashback, by Warpath to the rest of X-Force in X-Force #11 (2009). Warpath obtained this knowledge through a vision with the help of Ghost Rider. 
Eli Bard was born "Eliphas" at the height of the Roman Empire. He was recognized as an outstanding soldier until a spear injury ended his military career. For a while he worked unsuccessfully as a poet until he met Aurelia, one of the most powerful women in Rome. He soon married her and achieved a position in the Senate. As a well-respected senator, he was known as a great orator and a friend to the army. His wife left him for a general named Mascius and conspired to give Mascius his seat in the Senate.
Left with nothing, Eliphas was approached by Selene, who offered him immortality in exchange for helping her kill and absorb every soul in Rome. Eliphas drew pentagrams and performed rituals at several locations in the city, but warned a small girl to get her family out. The girl's father alerted the authorities and Eliphas and Selene were captured before the spell could be carried out. Just before they were burned at the stake, Selene killed the guards. She cursed Eliphas for his perceived betrayal with an eternal life of torture, turning him into a vampire-like creature. Eliphas was buried alive for 700 years until a farmer discovered him in his field. Eliphas killed the farmer with a swift bite to the jugular. He spent the next several hundred years searching for Selene. He ran into the ancestral Apache tribe of Warpath. They recognized him as a vampire but could not stop him from wiping out almost the entire tribe.
Eliphas, having at some point in time changed his name to "Eli Bard," finally located Selene in Nova Roma, where she was worshiped as a god. Still in love with her despite her curse, Bard realized that he must make an offering to her before approaching her. 
Bard later joined the Purifiers, an anti-mutant terrorist group. During this time, he worked diligently to further the Purifiers' goals. Secretly, however, he had hoped to sacrifice thousands of Purifiers' souls using the same ritual from Rome in order to gain Selene's attention. He assisted in the resurrection of Bastion but the android was suspicious of him, as he had no record on him. After seeing Bastion reprogram an offspring of Magus, he changed his plan and instead re-animated the corpses in the burial grounds of the Apache tribe that he had decimated decades earlier using the Technarch transmode virus he had absorbed from an offspring of Magus. Among the bodies reanimated were those of the mutants Caliban and Thunderbird. He presented Caliban to Selene and stated that he intended to use Caliban's mutant tracking abilities to track down deceased mutants and reanimate them to form an army for Selene, an offer which she accepted. 
Eli Bard is shown with Caliban and Wither by the grave of Doug Ramsey in "X-Force" #18 (2009). 
He uses the virus to resurrect a variety of mutants, including Cypher, Banshee, the original Hellions, Risque, Pyro, and Destiny.
In "X-Force" #21, Selene's plans culminates when Bard uses the virus to resurrect the entire deceased mutant populace of Genosha.
When Bard returned to Proudstar's tribe's burial grounds to resurrect Caliban and Thunderbird, the spirits of the tribe rose to protect those buried there. Bard attacked them with Selene's mystical knife, transforming them into a Demon Bear. After fleeing the battle, Bard leaves the blade behind, unaware it was pivotal in Selene's plans. He is then dispatched to Utopia to retrieve it, taking Warpath hostage in the process. When he returns to Selene with the blade and the hostage, Selene kills him by stabbing him in the heart with the blade, reducing him to bones.
Powers and abilities.
Through Selene's magical curse, Eli Bard became an immortal vampire-like being. Unlike Selene's psychic vampirism, Bard seems to be of the more traditional blood sucking variety. As such, he has increased speed and strength, and is difficult (if not impossible) to kill. Bard also has limited knowledge of magic. He also demonstrated deadly skills in hand to hand combat, managing to overpower and nearly kill X-23.
Bard has also been altered at a molecular level by a techno-organic transmode virus taken from the Technarch spawn under the Purifiers' control. The virus gives him the ability to control those he reanimates. The virus has the potential to provide shapeshifting and other superhuman abilities.

Lange Antares

__NOTOC__
The Antares is a glider built by Lange Aviation produced in three different wing spans, 18, 20 and 23 meters. The 20 and 23 meter variants can be equipped with a 42-kW electric motor and SAFT VL 41M lithium-ion batteries.
The EM 42 is a fixed-shaft brushless DC electric motor (see Lange EA 42) running at 190-288 V, and drawing up to 160 A, the 42 kW motor can deliver up to 216 N.m of torque over a speed range of 160-1600 RPM with a total efficiency of 90%. Maximum continuous power is 38.5 kW, the motor weighs 29 kg, and the weight of power electronics is 10 kg. The motor turns a 2-blade fixed-pitch propeller LF-P42 constructed of composite materials with 2.00 m diameter.
The battery system consists of two battery packs positioned in the leading edges of both inner wings (72 cells divided into 24 modules containing 3 cells each). The battery life is expected to 3000 cycles or 20 years. Capacity of battery is 41 Ah (specific energy 136 Wh/kg and specific peak power 794 W/kg). The batteries can deliver 13 minutes at maximum power and maximum climb speed, and can climb 3,000 meters on one battery charge. The charger is integrated inside the fuselage so when landing elsewhere the pilot merely has to find an electric outlet socket. The glider has a modem connected to its main computer so that technicians can run diagnostics remotely.
The undercarriage is hydraulically operated. The tailwheel is steerable.

Demand Media

Demand Media, Inc. is an American content and social media company that operates online brands such as eHow, and Cracked, and is known for creating online content through its Demand Media Studios division based on a combination of measured consumer demand and predicted ROI. Demand Media's business model is controversial because their "content farms" have been accused of polluting search engine results with spam. The company also provides social media platforms to existing large company websites and distributes content bundled with social media tools to outlets around the web. The company also owns eNom, the world's second-largest domain registrar, and as of 2013, the most abused/abusive registrar of domains used for spam email, according to URIBL.
Demand Media was created in 2006 by a former private equity investor, Shawn Colo, and the former chairman of MySpace, Richard Rosenblatt.
The company employs an algorithm that identifies topics with high advertising potential, based on search engine query data and bids on advertising auctions. These topics are typically in the advice and how-to field. It then commissions freelancers to produce corresponding text or video content. The content is posted on a variety of sites, including YouTube and the company's own sites such as eHow, Livestrong.com, Trails.com, GolfLink.com, Mania.com, and Cracked.com.
History.
Demand Media was co-founded in May 2006 by Richard Rosenblatt and Shawn Colo. Rosenblatt has a long history of building and selling Internet media companies. As CEO of Intermix Media and Chairman of MySpace.com, Rosenblatt was one of the innovators of Internet social networking. Colo is a financial acquisition specialist. He worked for 10 years in the private equity industry as a Principal with Spectrum Equity Investors specializing in media and communications companies.
Demand Media raised more than $355 million in financing over its first two years from investors such as Oak Investment Partners, Spectrum Equity Investors, Generation Partners and Goldman Sachs.
In June 2007 Demand Media hired Charles Hilliard, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker and United Online senior executive, as its President and CFO and acquired Byron Reese's how-to website, ExpertVillage.com of Austin, TX, for about $20 million. Reese became the company's Chief Innovation Officer and developed the algorithm that the company now uses to identify topics with high advertising potential. By 2008, Demand Media had acquired more than 30 domain name portfolios and owned 65 destination websites. Demand Media said that its 2009 revenue was nearly $200 million and that it was making a profit, but in fact the company had never been profitable.
In July 2008 it was widely reported that Yahoo! was interested in buying Demand Media for between $1.5 and $2 billion. Sources close to both companies said Yahoo! executives were attracted to Demand Media’s generation of advertising impressions and its ability to create niche social networks for media sites. Demand Media CEO Richard Rosenblatt later said that the company was not for sale. The deal never got past the talking stage. It was reported that Rosenblatt wanted a price closer to $3 billion for Demand Media.
Acquisitions.
Since 2006, Demand Media has acquired a collection of relatively unknown sites and relaunched them with social networking features and video capabilities that serve specific niche interests In the company’s first six months it made nine acquisitions, including the purchase of major registrars eNom and BulkRegister. On November 6, 2008, Demand Media Head of M & A Shawn Colo said the company would continue to buy niche, well-trafficked sites because the company is profitable and still has a lot of cash in the bank.
In 2008 Demand Media acquired Pluck, a company providing social networking and commenting solutions to other websites, for a reported $75 million in cash.
In August 2011, Demand Media announced acquisitions of IndieClick and RSS Graffiti.
On January 7, 2013, Demand Media announced the acquisition of domain name registrar Name.com.
On June 25, 2013, Demand Media announced the acquisition of Society6.
Business model.
Demand Media executives say their websites are content-driven to attract visitors by showing up in multiword search-engine queries. The more words that are typed into a search engine, the more specific the search will be. This is called “the long tail” search. Demand Media attempts to get visitors to its websites with these long-tail searches. It then tries to retain visitors with related content and social media tools. Their social media platforms get 3 billion interactions per month for clients with already well established brands. Demand Media commissions specific website content that it then distributes to its own websites and others where they have advertising revenue sharing agreements. As of 2008 Demand Media owned 135,000 videos and 340,000 articles. It is the largest contributor to YouTube, uploading between 10,000 and 20,000 new videos per month, and gets about 1.5 million page views per day on YouTube.
Content is generated via a process in which Demand Media uses algorithms to generate titles, then posts the titles to a screened pool of freelance writers or video creators. The list of available titles used to be over 100,000 but was severely curtailed in the second half of 2011. Typically, writers can claim up to ten titles and then have a week to submit the articles. Format and length are dictated by guidelines. Submitted articles go to an editor (also a freelancer) who can either clean it up or request a rewrite. After writers submit a revised article it is either accepted or rejected. Payment via PayPal is twice a week.
Demand Media’s acquisition of Pluck.com in 2008 gave it the means to provide specialized content and social media platforms to any website. The content comes with advertising attached. The website owners get free content for their sites and split the advertising revenue with Demand Media. This hybrid Internet publishing model has been referred to as Curated Social Content. It is a combination of Enterprise Generated Media, such as newspapers, and consumer-generated media, such as blogs.
IPO.
As of second quarter 2010, "Financial Times" reported that Demand Media was planning on an initial public offering which would mean any acquisitions would be out of the question. IPO filing was completed in August 2010. Shares were initially expected to be offered in December 2010, in an offer that would give Demand Media a value of approximately $1.5 billion. However, due to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation regarding the company's novel accounting for "long-lived content," the IPO pricing was delayed until January, 2011. On January 12, 2011, the company announced it would price its IPO between $14 and $16 per share giving it a valuation of approximately $1.3 billion. Some blogs have questioned Demand Media's claim to be profitable, given that its IPO filings show that has reported losses for the past several years. Additionally, several news sources claim that the company's accounting practices have recently been the subject of government examination.
Post-IPO the stock rose to the mid-20s, but by fall 2011 had plateaued under $7.00.
Criticism.
Demand Media has attracted criticism from Internet watchdogs for being one of the largest buyers of articles and videos, purchasing thousands of search engine-driven content from low-paid freelancers to use on its websites to attract advertisers, such as Google's AdSense.
Demand Media has also been criticized for its accounting methods, such as capitalizing the costs of content and amortizing them over five years, giving them the appearance of profitability.

2008 Eastern Michigan Eagles football team

The 2008 Eastern Michigan Eagles football team represented Eastern Michigan University during the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season. Eastern Michigan competed as a member of the Mid-American Conference.
The team was led by head coach Jeff Genyk, who was released at the end of the season. He was replaced by Ron English.
2008 started with a bang in a 52-0 defeat of Indiana State. For longtime fans, this was repayment for an embarrassing loss to ISU in 2001. Despite the strong start, Eastern lost 4 straight after the opener, and was never close in any of them. Then they pulled off a road upset of Bowling Green, who had beaten BCS member Pittsburgh earlier in the year. But after that, they had two close losses by three at West Point to Army, and by seven at home to Akron. 
After a loss to Temple on November 22, 2008, Eastern Michigan fired coach Jeff Genyk, but would allow him to coach the Eagle's final game of the season against rival Central Michigan. Many games lost by 7 points or less was one of the reasons given for firing Genyk. Eastern won that game, however, 56-52. Two national records were set against CMU as QB Andy Schmitt had 58 completions and Tyler Jones tied a record by catching 23 passes. With Eastern Michigan's win over Central Michigan, all three schools split the series, and Eastern retained the Michigan MAC Trophy on the tie. Schmitt finished 58/80 for 516 yards (school record), threw 5 TDs, and ran for one more. Most of these records were reset from just the week prior against Temple. In that game, Schmitt finished 50/76 for 485 yards, but Eastern was outscored by three. His 76 passes in a game without an interception set an NCAA record. He was only intercepted once against Central with 80 passes. 
Schmitt's return as a 5th year senior in 2009 was a point of optimism for fans. For those two games he was 108/156 for 1001 yards and 1 interception. Perhaps the 2009 season would have been much different (instead of 0-12) if Schmitt had not gone down with a career-ending knee injury early in that season.

Andrée Putman

Andrée Putman (23 December 1925 – 19 January 2013) was a French interior and product designer.
She was the mother of Olivia Putman and of Cyrille Putman
Life and Work.
Childhood and youth (1925–1944).
Andrée Christine Aynard was born into a wealthy family of bankers and notables from Lyon. Her paternal grandfather, Edouard Aynard, founded the Maynard & Sons Bank; her paternal grandmother, Rose de Montgolfier, was a descendant of the hot-air balloon inventors' family. Her father was a graduate from the prestigious Ecole Normale Supérieure who spoke seven languages but swore to a life of austerity and seclusion to protest against his own milieu; her mother, Louise Saint-René Taillandier, was a concert pianist who found comfort in the frivolity of "being a great artist without a stage".,
Her formal artistic education first came, however, through music. Her mother took her and her sister to concerts and urged them to learn the piano. But she was later told that her hands were not suited to the piano and, as a consequence, she would never be a virtuoso. She then switched her focus to studying composition at the National Conservatory of Paris. At the age of nineteen, she received the First Harmony Prize of the Conservatory from Francis Poulenc himself. On that occasion, he told her that at least 10 more years of unremitting work and ascetic life would be necessary to before she could—maybe—aspire to a career as a composer. Picturing herself living like a Carmelite nun at the Fontenay Abbey, she cut short the musical career she had undertaken as a tribute to her mother. Putman decided to satisfy her curiosity and creative instincts another way.
Professional beginnings (1945–1978).
At the age of 20 she had a serious bike accident, which she barely survived. Her characteristic posture stemmed from this event: she was a tall woman who stood straight and walked as if on a tightrope. Soon after the accident, she broke free from her initial career in music and from the illusion of safety her social environment offered her and decided to discover the world. One day, she emptied her bedroom and furnished it with just a hard iron bed, a chair and a Miró poster on the white walls. This early expression of her desire of independence led to a confrontation with her family who wondered “if she realises the sorrow she makes them feel?” 
“What can one do when one did not go to school and is a musician who stopped playing music?”, she asked her maternal grandmother, Madeleine Saint-René Taillandier. “Nothing except messenger”, was the reply. Taking her grandmother's advice, Andrée started working as a messenger for "Femina" magazine. While taking care of all the dirty little jobs of the office, she observed with a sharp eye the social theatre which takes place during meetings. She worked for "Elle" and "L’Oeil", a prestigious art magazine where the still-lives she imagined with objects of various styles and from different periods attracted attention. She identified what is sophisticated and innovative, widened her knowledge of designers... and walked by the Café de Flore everyday. "We could see Antonin Artaud, Juliette Greco, Giacometti, Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir… People who looked free and were emancipated from conventions.”
These first jobs allowed Andrée to meet artists, characters more familiar to her than intellectuals. At the time, she was not confident enough to fully express herself. She therefore stayed in the background rather to put the talents of others in the limelight, something for which she showed great talent since she was raised in an artistically-rich environment. Personally knowing what it is to “be trapped into the beaten tracks”, she was moved by “people whose work is not understood”, “impressed by these artists who do not look for anything else but remaining in the depth of their sincerity, their risk”, she only wished to help them and establish a connection between them and the rest of the world. In the late 1950s, Andrée Aynard married Jacques Putman, an art critic, collector and publisher. Together they associated with artists such as Pierre Alechinsky, Bram van Velde, Alberto Giacometti and Niki de Saint Phalle.
In 1958,Putman collaborated with the retail chain "Prisunic" as Art Director of the Home Department, where her motto was to "design beautiful things for nothing". Her wish of making art available to a larger public also became a reality through "Prisunic" as she organised with her husband editions of lithographs by famous artists sold for only 100 Francs (15 €). In 1968, she distinguished herself in the style agency Mafia until Didier Grumbach spotted her in 1971 and hired her to start a new company which was aimed at developing the textile industry: "Créateurs & Industriels". Her intuition led her to reveal many talented designers such as Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Issey Miyake, Ossie Clark, Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler. It is at that moment that she went into interior design as she converted the former SNCF premises into a showroom and offices for the company.
Ecart (1978–1995).
In the late 1970s, "Créateurs & Industriels" went bankrupt; Putman got divorced. She tried to materialise her intense feeling of emptiness: at the time she lives in a room furnished with only a bed and two lamps “in total austerity, because I no longer knew what I liked”. Taking her friend Michel Guy’s advice, she decided to found "Ecart" (which backwards is Trace.) It is therefore at the age of 53 that Andrée Putman really started the career which made her famous from Hong Kong to New York. She started by giving life again to forgotten designers from the 1930s: René Herbst, Jean-Michel Frank, Pierre Chareau, Robert Mallet-Stevens, Gaudi, Eileen Gray... "My only concern was to interest at least ten persons and I would have accomplished something which would carry me for all my life". These pieces of furniture won over not ten, but thousands of people. From releasing furniture to designing interiors, the evolution of activity came quite naturally. took the next logical step: “I loathe pompous luxury. I take interest in the essential, the framework, the basic elements of things.”
The interior design of the Morgans Hotel in New York in 1984 marked a turning point in Andrée Putman’s career: she managed to make a high-standard hotel with a small budget and asserted her style with sober rooms and visual effects. “Because I started working in New York, the French suddenly asked for me.” From the 1980s, she led more and more interior design projects: hotels such as Le Lac in Japan, Im Wasserturm in Germany and the Sheraton in Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris; stores for Azzedine Alaia, Balenciaga, Bally and Lagerfeld; offices, particularly the one for French Minister of Culture Jack Lang in 1984; and museums like the CAPC, Bordeaux's contemporary art museum.
In her work, not only did Putman reconcile "rich" and "poor" materials, find a new way to use light and cleared spaces to rediscover their origin; she also tackled the ways of living. The private residences she designed enabled her to break the rules: why dine in the dining room, cook in the kitchen and sleep in the bedroom when one can overcome obstacles and change one’s ways? “It is not about bathing in the living room and cooking in the bedroom but rather about opening spaces to various activities. Why should places be reduced to one function instead of favouring the sensations they bring us?” Putman was among the first in France to live in a loft. Her free spirit was also exhibited in her love of practical jokes.
The Andrée Putman Studio (1997–2010).
In 1997, Andrée Putman created her eponymous Studio, specialising in interior design, product design and scenography.
When she imagined objects, she refused the excess of striving to re-design pieces which were perfectly designed by others in the past. “We have to accept that many things can no longer be changed – or very slightly. If we change them, we have to add humour, detachment. What interests me: a joke in a collection, a sign of complicity.” For example, when she began collaborating with Christofle in 2000, she designed a collection of silver cutlery, objects and jewellery named "Vertigo". The common element of this collection was a slightly twisted ring: “the fact that this ring is twisted brings life to it: did it fall? Why is it asymmetrical? Life is made of imperfections.”She created a Champagne bucket for Veuve Clicquot and reinterpreted the iconic Louis Vuitton Steamer Bag. In 2001, Putman created "Préparation Parfumée". In 2003, she launched her own line of furniture "Préparation meublée" where the pieces were ironically named "Croqueuse de diamants", "Jeune bûcheron", "Bataille d'oreillers"… ("Gold digger", "Young lumberjack" and "Pillow fight"). In 2004, she creates a stunning Russian tea set for Gien: Polka. An interior designer, she carried out the projects for Pershing Hall in Paris, the Morgans Hotel in Manhattan, and the Blue Spa at the Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich. In 2005, Guerlain chooses the Studio Putman to re-design its flagship store on the Champs Elysées. Among notable private commissions are the Pagoda House in Tel Aviv, the vast SoHo penthouse for Serge and Tatiana Sorokko, and a cliff-house in Tangier for Bernard-Henri Lévy and Arielle Dombasle, for whom Putman completely restructured the building.
In 2007, a new era began as Andrée's daughter Olivia Putman agreed to take over the Art Direction of the Studio, a wish its founder had expressed for a long time. "We realised that time and Andrée's fame had turned our family name into an adjective. Qualified in History of Art and landscape architecture, Olivia wishes to perpetuate the eclecticism and curiosity her mother always claimed. In 2008, Paris Mayor Bertand Delanoë made Andrée President of the first Paris Design Comity, which aims at rethinking street furniture, Parisian public equipments and employees' uniforms. That same year, she presented "Voie Lactée" ("Milky Way"), the grand piano she designed for France's oldest piano manufacturer Pleyel and unveiled "Entrevue", her creation for Bisazza at the Salone del Mobile in Milan. In June, the store she designed for fashion designer Anne Fontaine in New York was inaugurated, following the ones designed in Paris and Tokyo.
The following year, Andrée and Olivia present the chair they designed for the American firm Emeco, a line of sunglasses for RAC Paris, a collection of carpets for Toulemonde Bochart, a knife for the Forge de Laguiole, as well as furniture for Fermob and Silvera. The Studio was also called upon to imagine the scenography for French singer Christophe's concerts at the Olympia and at Versailles, and the Madeleine Vionnet exhibition at the "Musée des Arts Décoratifs" in Paris. In October 2009, a new monograph dedicated to Andrée Putman's career is published by Rizzoli Editions. In 2010, Paris' City Hall paid tribute to Andrée Putman by hosting a great exhibition about her life, for which Olivia is curator. The event "Andrée Putman, ambassador of style" attracted more than 250,000 visitors.
Death.
Putman died at her apartment in the sixth arrondissement of Paris, on 19 January 2013, aged 87.

Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co.

Overview.
The Piggly Wiggly Carolina Company, headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, was founded in 1947. “The Pig” was a large employee-owned, privately operated retail company that had more than 3,000 employees and 100 stores throughout South Carolina and coastal Georgia. On September 12th 2013, it was announced that Piggly Wiggly Carolina would sell 29 of its stores to Bi-Lo and Harris Teeter; all but abandoning the Charleston, SC market. It also closed its flagship store at Northbridge, along with several others. They also announced that they were shutting down their distribution centers in North Charleston and Jedburg, SC; letting C&S Wholesalers distribute to the remaining handful of stores.
History.
Piggly Wiggly Carolina Company was founded by Joseph T. Newton Jr. He purchased a Piggly Wiggly Franchise from the Piggly Wiggly Corporation.
Originally based in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, Joe Newton and his son-in-law Burt Schools moved the main warehouse to North Charleston, SC in 1959. In the decade after, he bought out Piggly Wiggly Carolina (based in Columbia, SC), and merged the two companies as Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co. In 1958, Joe Newton’s son-in-law, Burt Schools, joined the business, and in 1962, Joe’s son, Joseph T. “Buzzy” Newton, III, also joined the business.
In April 2007, after 45 years with Piggly Wiggly, Buzzy Newton retired as president and became chairman of the board. Upon Newton’s retirement, David R. Schools, Burt Schools’ son and Buzzy Newton’s nephew, was named President of Piggly Wiggly Carolina Company and Greenbax Enterprises; a wholly owned subsidiary of Piggly Wiggly Carolina.
There isn't much left of Piggly Wiggly Carolina. After retreating from its home base in Charleston, SC, the 25 remaining stores are peppered throughout mostly rural areas in South Carolina. The distribution warehouses, in North Charleston and Jedburg will shut down in February 2014.
Services.
Piggly Wiggly stores house a variety of departments including general grocery, meat, seafood, produce, deli, bakery, floral and pharmacy. Online shopping services are available at select locations. 
Many Piggly Wiggly stores offer a selection of wine including labels from France, Italy, South America, and Australia in addition to the United States.
Greenbax Enterprises.
Greenbax Enterprises began as a sister corporation to Piggly Wiggly Carolina Company in the 1950s. Greenbax are given with purchases, and these can be cashed in for discounts on groceries and merchandise that advertises the store. Greenbax discontinued the traditional paper stamps and began recording each customer’s balance electronically on the Pig's Favorite Customer (PFC) card. Shoppers can electronically redeem Greenbax at Piggly Wiggly stores, the Greenbax Online Catalog via the internet at www.Greenbax.net, or at other partner business locations.

Saint Clair Cemin

Saint Clair Cemin is a Brazilian born (1951) sculptor and painter. He lives and works in New York City. His work encompasses multiple styles, approaches, and materials, from furniture to toys in popular culture to the history of sculpture.
Cemin became interested in sculpting as a teenager through inspirational conversations with intellectuals in his home city. Once interested in philosophy and physics, he began to focus his attention on art, drawing and working on illustrations for magazines. Cemin earned his degree at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France, from 1975-1978 where he learned printmaking for three years. He moved to New York shortly after, where he experimented in several fields as a way of earning an income. From 1981 to 1983, Cemin worked in carpentry renovating lofts in New York, cabinet making, and finally sculpture. The artist's first exhibited sculpture was "The Granny Ashtray", which has been described as an anti-modernist piece. 
Throughout the 1980s Cemin became an integral part of NY's east village art scene which included a circle of important contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons. Some of his works from this era are on permanent exhibition at important institutions such as the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. 
After those formative years in NYC Cemin moved to Egypt and then Paris to pursue sculpture in different environments and with different mediums. After 2010 he returned to NY and continues to create sculptural works in his Brooklyn studio. In 2012 he had a major public exhibition of works along Broadway in Manhattan. Of the several works exhibited on Broadway one "vortex" at the corner of 57th street and Broadway, stood some 40 feet tall.
He has also published a book of his writings through Edgewise Press titled, "Fragments of a Mind: Stories and Comments on Art 1987-2004".
Collections.
Saint Clair Cemin's work is included in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Musee de la Chasse et de la Nature, Paris, France; Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico; Fonds National d’Art Contemporain, Paris, France; Rooseum, Stockholm, Sweden; and the Eli Broad Foundation, Los Angeles, among many others.

<doc id="21494511" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21494511" title="Olympic-Wallowa Lineament">
Olympic-Wallowa Lineament

The Olympic-Wallowa lineament (OWL) – first reported by cartographer Erwin Raisz in 1945 on a relief map of the continental United States – is a physiographic feature of unknown origin in the state of Washington (northwestern U.S.) running approximately from the town of Port Angeles, on the Olympic Peninsula to the Wallowa Mountains of eastern Oregon.
Location.
Raisz located the OWL particularly from Cape Flattery (the northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula) and along the north shore of Lake Crescent, thence the Little River (south of Port Angeles), Liberty Bay (Poulsbo), Elliott Bay (setting the orientation of the streets in downtown Seattle), the north shore of Mercer Island, the Cedar River (Chester Morse Reservoir), Stampede Pass (Cascade crest), the south side of the Kittitas Valley (I-90), Manastash Ridge, the Wallula Gap (on the Columbia River where it approaches the Oregon state line), and then the South Fork of the Walla Walla River into the northeastern corner of Oregon. After crossing the Blue Mountains Riasz associated the OWL with a dramatic scarp on the north side of the Wallowa Mountains. Riasz observed that the OWL tends to have basins on the north side (Seattle Basin, Kittitas Valley, Pasco Basin, Walla Walla Basin) and mountains on the southern side (the Olympics, Manastash and Umtanum ridges, Rattlesnake Mountain, the Horseheaven Hills, the Wallowa Mountains), and noted parallel alignments at various points, generally about four miles north or south of the main line. The alignment of these particular features is somewhat irregular; modern maps with much more detail show a broad zone of more regular alignments. Subsequent geological investigations have suggested various refinements and adjustments.
Introduction to a puzzle.
Most geological features are initially identified or characterized from a local expression of that feature. The OWL was first identified as a perceptual effect, a pattern perceived by the human visual system in a broad field of many seemingly random elements. But is it real? Or just an optical illusion, such as the Kanizsa triangle (see image), where we "see" a triangle that does not really exist?
Raisz considered whether the OWL might be just a chance alignment of random elements, and geologists since have not been able to find any common unitary feature, nor identify any connection between the various local elements. called it a "fictional structural element". Yet it has been found to be coincide with many faults and fault zones, and to delineate significant differences of geology. These are much too correlated to be dismissed as random alignments. But for all of its prominence, there is as yet no understanding of what the OWL is or how it came to be; it looms just beyond the horizon of current human knowledge.
The OWL piques the interest of geologically minded persons in part because its characteristic NW-SE angle of orientation – approximately 50 to 60 degrees west of north (a little short of northwest) – is shared by many other seeming local features across a broad swath of geography. Around Seattle these include strikingly parallel alignments at the south end of Lake Washington, the north side of Elliott Bay, the valley of the Ship Canal, the bluff along Interlaken Blvd. (aligned with the Ship Canal, but offset slightly to the north), the alignment of Ravenna Creek (draining Green Lake southeast into Union Bay) and Carkeek Creek (northwest into Puget Sound), various stream drainages around Lake Forest Park (north end of Lake Washington), and (on the Eastside) the Northrup Valley (Hwy. 520 from Yarrow Bay to the Overlake area), and various smaller details too numerous to mention. All of these are carved into "recent" (less than 18,000 years old) glacial deposits, and it is difficult to conceive of how these could be controlled by anything other than a recent glacial process.
Yet the same orientation shows up in the Brothers, Euguene-Denio, and McLoughlin fault zones in Oregon (see map, below), which are geological features tens of millions of years old, and the Walker Lane lineament in Nevada.
Likewise to the east, where both the OWL and the Brothers Fault Zone become less distinct in Idaho where they hit the old North American continental craton and the track of Yellowstone hotspot. But some 50 miles to the north is the parallel Trans-Idaho Discontinuity, and further north, the Osburn fault (Lewis and Clark line) running roughly from Missoula to Spokane. And aeromagnetic and gravitational anomaly surveys suggest extension into the interior of the continent.
All of these alignments seem too strong to be random, but as yet it is quite a puzzle of how features millions of years old are linked with features only thousands of years young, and across hundreds of miles of diverse geology. Geology has not yet sorted this out. So this article will examine what the puzzle looks like before the pieces are assembled, touching on what may – or may not – be parts of the answers, and showing that shadowy zone at the edge of knowledge. Because geologists do not yet know even which pieces are relevant, a wide and even speculative view must be taken. This is what science looks like at the edge, before it is tamed and neatly trimmed.
Structural relationships with other features.
A problem in evaluating any hypothesis regarding the OWL is a dearth of evidence.
Raisz suggested that the OWL might be a "transcurrent fault" (long strike-slip faults at what are now known to be plate boundaries), but lacked both data and competence to assess it. One of the first speculations that the OWL might be a major geological structure – written when the theory of plate tectonics was still new and not entirely accepted – was called by the author "an outrageous hypothesis". Modern investigation is still largely balked by the immense span of geography involved and lack of continuous structures, the lack of clearly cross-cutting features, and a confusing expression in both rock millions of years old and glacial sediments only 16,000 years old.

Geological investigation of a feature begins with determining its structure, composition, age, and relationship with other features. The OWL does not cooperate. It is expressed as an orientation in many elements of diverse structure and compositions, and even as a boundary between areas of differing structure and composition; there is yet no understanding of what kind of feature or process – the "ur-OWL" – could control this. Nor are there particular "OWL" rocks which can be examined and radiometrically dated. We are left with determining its age by looking at its relationship with other features, such as which features overlap or cross-cut other (presumably older) features. In the following sections we will look at several features which might be expected to have some kind of structural relationship with the OWL, and consider what they might tell us about the OWL.
Cascade Range.
The most notable geological feature crossing the OWL is the Cascade Range, raised up in the Pliocene (two to five million years ago) as a result of the Cascadia subduction zone. These mountains are distinctly different on either side of the OWL, the material of the South Cascades being Cenozoic (<66 Ma) volcanic and sedimentary rock, and the North Cascades being much older Paleozoic (hundreds of millions of years) metamorphic and plutonic rocks. It is unknown whether this difference is in any way linked with the OWL, or is simply a coincidental regional difference.
Raisz judged the Cascades on the north side of the OWL to be offset about six miles to the west, and similarly for the Blue Mountains, but this is questionable, and similar offsets are not apparent in the older – up to 17 Ma (millions of years) old – Columbia River basalt flows. In general, there are no clear indications of structures offset by the OWL, but neither are there any distinct features crossing the OWL (and older than 17 Ma) that positively demonstrate a lack of offsetting.
Straight Creek Fault.
The Straight Creek Fault (SCF) – just east of Snoqualmie Pass and running nearly due north into Canada – is a major fault notable for considerable identified dextral strike-slip offset (opposite side moving laterally to the right) of at least . Its intersection with the OWL (near Kachess Lake) is the geological equivalent of an atom smasher, and the results should be informative. For example, that the OWL is not offset suggests that it must be younger than the last strike-slip motion on the SCF, anywhere from around 44 to about 41 million years ago (i.e., during the middle-Eocene epoch). And if the OWL is a strike-slip fault or megashear, as many have speculated, then it should offset the SCF, and whether the OWL offsets the SCF, or not, becomes an important test of just what the OWL is.
So does the OWL offset the SCF, or not? It is hard to say, as no trace whatsoever has been found of the SCF anywhere south of the OWL. While some geologists have speculated that it does continue directly south, albeit hidden under younger deposits, not a trace has been found.
If the SCF fault does not continue directly southward – and the utter lack of evidence that it does makes a case for evidence of lack – then where else might it be? suggest some possibilities: it may curve to the east, it may curve to the west, or it may just end.
Tabor mapped the SCF turning and merging with the Taneum fault (coincident with the OWL) south of Kachess Lake. This conforms with the general pattern seen in Lakes Keechelus, Kachess, and Cle Elum, and associated geological units and faults (see image, right): each is aligned north—south at the north end, but turns to the southeast where it approaches the OWL. This is suggestive of the OWL being a "left" lateral (sinistral) strike-slip fault that has distorted and offset the SCF. But that is inconsistent with the SCF itself and most other strike-slip faults associated with the OWL being "right" lateral (dextral), and incompatible with the geology to the southeast. Particularly, studies of the region to the southeast (in connection with Department of Energy activities at the Hanford Reservation) show no indication of any fault or other structure comparable to the SCF.
On the other hand, maps the SCF as proceeding southerly (without addressing the situation south of the OWL). (He has subsequently speculated that the missing part of the SCF may have been dextrally offset to become a southerly trending fault in the Puget Lowland. But same problem: later deposits cover any traces.) The seeming southeasterly curvature is possibly explained as a geometrical effect of foreshortening: it occurs in a belt of intense folding (much resembling a rug which has slid against a wall) which, if unfolded, could restore some of the "curves" to a linear position along the southerly extension of the SCF.
There seem to be no indications that the SCF "turns" to the west. Although such indications would mostly be buried, the general sense of the topography suggests no such turn. Displacement, to either the west or the east, seems unlikely in that certain effects that would be expected are not found.
Could the SCF just end? This is difficult to comprehend. If there is displacement along this fault, where did it come from? To quote Wyld et al. (albeit in the context of a different fault): "it cannot just end". Although the SCF has had substantial strike-slip displacement, claim that final major movement on the SCF (about 40 Ma ago) was dominantly dip-slip (vertical displacement). So perhaps the displacement came from the depths, and, as it was extruded, was eroded and redistributed as sediments. But this has not been established.
Another possibility is that the missing southern segment of the SCF is on a crustal block that rotated away from the OWL. There is evidence that around 45 million years ago much of Oregon and southwestern
Washington rotated some 60° or more about a pivot somewhere in the Olympic Peninsula (see Oregon rotation, below). This would have left a large gap south of the OWL, which could explain why Cenozoic rocks are not found immediately south of the OWL. This suggests that a continuation of the SCF, if any, and the missing Cenozoic, might be somewhere southwest of Mount Saint Helens, but this has not been observed.
Darrington–Devils Mountain Fault Zone.
The interaction of the Straight Creek Fault with the OWL has yielded practically no intelligible information, and remains as enigmatic as the OWL itself. More informative is the closely related Darrington—Devils Mountain Fault Zone (DDMFZ). It runs east from a complex of faults on the southern end of Vancouver Island to the town of Darrington, where it turns south to converge with the SCF (see map, above).
North of the DDMFZ (and west of the SCF) is the Chuckanut Formation (part of the "Northwest Cascade System" of rocks shown in green on the map), an Eocene sedimentary formation which formed adjacent to the Swauk, Roslyn and other formations (also in green) south of Mount Stuart; their wide separation is attributed to right-lateral strike-slip movement along the SCF. That the northern part of the DDMFZ shows "left"-lateral strike-slip movement is not the inconsistency it may initially seem – think of the motion on either side of an arrowhead.
It appears that what is now the DDMFZ was originally aligned on the OWL. Then about 50 Ma ago North America crashed into what is now the Olympic Peninsula along an axis nearly perpendicular to the OWL, pushing the rock of the Mesozoic (pre-Cenozoic) Western and Eastern Melange Belts (WEMB, blue on the map) across the OWL, bowing the DDMFZ, and initiating the SCF and thereby splitting the Chuckanut Formation. On the north side of the DDMFZ, and wrapping around a bit to the east side, is a suite of distinctive rocks – the Helena—Haystack mélange ("HH Melange" on the map) – which was collapsed into vertical folds. Similarly distinctive rock is found in Manastash Ridge (shown on the map, but almost too small to see) still lying on the OWL, just "east" of the SCF.
This can explain an early puzzle as to why the Mesozoic rocks just south of the DDMFZ – the Western and Eastern Melange Belts – have no counterpart on the east side of the OWL and offset to the south: they were not faulted by the SCF, but were pushed against it from the southwest.
Then it gets curiouser. Rock very similar to the WEMB (including a type called blueschist) is also found in the San Juan Islands, and along the West Coast fault on the west side of Vancouver Island. This suggests that the OWL was once a strike-slip fault, possibly a continental margin, along which terranes moved from the southeast. But similar rock also occurs in the Rimrock Lake Inlier, about 75 km south of the OWL and just west of the projected trace of the SCF, and also in the Klamath Mountains of southwestern Oregon. To account for the wide dispersal of this rock is difficult; many geologists see no alternative to transport along an extended SCF. But that upsets some of the "solutions" described above, and there is yet no consensus on this.
CLEW and Columbia Plateau.
Further east is the "CLEW", the segment of the OWL from approximately the town of Cle Elum (marking the western limit of the Columbia River basalts) to the Wallula Gap (a narrow gap on the Columbia River just north of the Oregon border). This segment, and the associated Yakima fold belts, do include many northeast-trending faults crossing the
OWL. However, these are largely dip-slip (vertical) faults, associated with compressional folding of the overlying basalt. As there is typically 3 km of sedimentary deposits separating the basalts
(also about 3 km thick) from the basement rock, these faults are somewhat isolated from the deeper structure. The geological consensus is that any strike-slip activity on the OWL predates the 17 Ma old Columbia River Basalt Group.
There is some evidence that some of the northwest-trending ridges may have some continuity with the basement structure, but the nature and details of the deeper structure is not known.
A 260 km long seismic refraction profile
showed a rise in the crustal basement beneath the OWL, but was unable to determine if that rise was aligned with the OWL, or just coincidentally crossed the OWL at the same location as the profile; gravity data suggested the latter. The seismic data showed a uniformity of rock type and thickness across the OWL that discounts the possibility of it being a boundary between continental and oceanic crust. The results were interpreted as suggesting continental rifting during the Eocene, perhaps a failed rift basin, possibly connected with the rotation of the Klamath Mountain block away from the Idaho Batholith (see Oregon rotation, below).
There is a curious change of character of the OWL in the center of the CLEW where it crosses the roughly north-trending Hog Ranch—Naneum Anticline. West of there the OWL seems to follow a ridge in the basement structure, to the east it follows a gravity gradient, much like the Klamath–Blue Mountain LIneament (see below) does.
The significance of all this is not known.
Hite Fault System.
Past the Wallula Gap the OWL is identified with the Wallula Fault Zone, which heads towards the Blue Mountains. The Wallula Fault Zone is active, but whether that can be attributed to the OWL is unknown: it may be that, like the Yakima Fold Belt, it is a result of regional stresses, and is expressed only in the superficial basalt, quite independently of what ever is happening in the basement rock.
At the western edge of the Blue Mountains the Wallula Fault zone intersects the northeast-striking Hite Fault System (HFS). This system is complex and has been variously interpreted.
Although seismically active it appears to be offset by, and thus should be older than, the Wallula fault.
On the other hand, a later study found "no obvious displacement" of either the OWL or HFS–related faults. Reidel et al. suggested that the HFS reflects the "eastern" margin of a piece of old continental craton (centered around the "HF" – Hite Fault – on the map) that has slipped south; Kuehn attributed 80 to 100 kilometers of left-lateral displacement along the HFS (and significant vertical displacements).
The interaction of the Wallula and Hite Fault systems is not yet understood. Past the Hite Fault System the OWL enters a region of geological complexity and confusion, where even the trace of the OWL is less clear, even to the point where it has been suggested that both the topographic feature and the Wallula fault are terminated by the Hite fault.
The original topographic lineament as described by Raisz is along the scarp on the northeast side of the Wallowa Mountains. However, there is a sense that the trend of the faulting in that area turns more to the south; it has been suggested the faulting associated with the OWL takes a large step south to the Vale Fault Zone, which connects with the Snake River Fault Zone in Idaho.
Both of these lines introduce a bend into the OWL. The Imnaha Fault (striking towards Riggins, Idaho) is more nearly in line with the rest of the OWL, and in line with the previously mentioned gravitational anomalies that run into the continent.
Which ever way is deemed correct, it is notable that the OWL seems to change character after it crosses the Hite Fault System. What this says about the nature of the OWL is unclear, although Kuehn concluded that, in northeastern Oregon or western Idaho, it is not a tectonically significant structure.
Wallowa terrane.
As described above, the trace of the OWL becomes faint and somewhat confused between the Blue Mountains and the margin of the North American craton (the thick orange line on the map, just beyond the Oregon—Idaho border; the dashed line on the diagram below). This is the Wallowa terrane, a piece of crust that drifted in from somewhere else and got jammed between the Columbia Embayment to the west and the North American continent to the east and north. A notable feature is the anomalously elevated Wallowa Mountains, to the east is Hells Canyon (Snake River) on the Oregon—Idaho border. Northeast of the OWL (Wallowa Mountains) is the Clearwater Embayment ("CE" on the map), delineated by ancient rock of the craton. Southwest of this section of the OWL is a region of grabens (where large blocks of crust have dropped) extending about south to the nearly parallel Vale Fault Zone (see diagram, below).

Grabens form where the crust is being stretched or extended. Several explanations have been offered as to why this is happening here. theorized that right-lateral slip on the Wallula Fault is being transferred to more southerly faults such as the Vale Fault, wherefore he labelled this region the Wallula–Vale Transfer Zone. suggested that crustal deformation in this region is a continuation of the Basin and Range region immediately to the south, with any connection to the OWL deemed circumstantial. Another explanation is that clock-wise rotation of part of Oregon (discussed below) about a point near the Wallula Gap has pulled the Blue Mountains away from the OWL; this might also explain why the OWL seems to be bending here.
These theories may all have some truth to them, but what they might imply regarding the genesis and structure of the OWL has not been worked out.
Hells Canyon – North America's deepest river gorge – is so deep because the terrain it cuts through is so high. This is generally attributed to thinning of the crust, which allows the hotter, and therefore lighter and more buoyant, mantle material to rise higher. This is believed by many to be involved with the Yellowstone hotspot and Columbia River Basalts; the nature of such involvement, if any, is hotly debated.
While the Yellowstone hotspot and Columbia River Basalts do not seem to directly interact with the OWL, clarification of their origin and context might explain some of the OWL's context, and even constrain possible models. Likewise, clarification of the nature and history of the Wallowa terrane, and particularly of the nature and causes of the apparent bending and multiple alignments of the OWL in this region, would be a major step in understanding the OWL.
Columbia Embayment and KBML.
The bedrock of Washington and Oregon, like most of the continent, is nearly all pre-Cenozoic rock, older than 66 million years. The exception is southwestern Washington and Oregon, which has virtually no pre-Cenozoic strata. This is the Columbia Embayment, a large indentation into the North American continent characterized by oceanic crust covered by thick sedimentary deposits. ("Embayment" is perhaps a misleading term, in that it suggests a bowing of a coast line, which only seems so in the context of the modern coast. In the geological past, the coast of North America was in Idaho and Nevada, as will be described later.)
The Columbia Embayment is of interest here because its northern margin is approximately delineated by the OWL. The variations are mainly in the region of the CLEW, where sediments are buried under the basalts of the Columbia Basin, and in Puget Sound, where the Cenozoic geology extends as far north as Vancouver Island. Whether the OWL might reflect a deeper crustal boundary has been
questioned by geophysical studies which may – or may not – see the characteristics expected of such a boundary.
The southern edge of the Columbia Embayment is along a line from the Klamath Mountains on the Oregon coast to a point in the Blue Mountains just east of the Wallula Gap. Unlike the OWL, this line has little topographical expression, and aside from the Hite Fault System is not associated with any major fault systems. But mapping of gravitational anomalies shows a definite lineament, some 700 km (about 400 miles) long, called the Klamath-Blue Mountain Lineament (KBML). This lineament is of interest here because of the possibility it was formerly conjugate with OWL, discussed in the next section.
Oregon rotation.
Then the situation gets very interesting. Measurements of paleomagnetism (the record of the direction the rock was pointed when it cooled) from a variety of sites in the Coast Range – from the Klamath Mountains to the Olympic Peninsula – consistently measure clockwise rotations of 50 to 70 degrees. (See map, below.)
One interpretation of this is that western Oregon and southwestern Washington have swung as a rigid block about a pivot point at the northern end, near the Olympic Peninsula.
The interesting thing is: backing out this rotation restores the Coast Range to an earlier position nearly juxtaposed against the OWL. argues that the Coast Range (believed to be seamounts that had previously accreted to the continent) were rifted away from the continent starting about 50 Ma ago (mid-Eocene). This interpretation implies a "back arc" of magmatism, probably fed by a subduction zone, and possibly implicated with the intrusion of various plutons in the North Cascades around 50 Ma. Curiously, this is just when the Kula–Farallon spreading ridge passed under the OWL (discussed below). found a spurt of rapid rotation around 45 Ma ago. This may be when this block was impinged by the Sierra Nevada block of California; note that around 40 Ma ago there was a change in the direction of the Pacific Plate (possibly due to collision with another plate). (The cause and nature of the rifting does not seem to have been worked out yet. Certain complications in the subduction of the Kula and Farallon plates may have been involved.)
During this rotation of the Coast Range the block of continental crust that is now the Blue Mountains (on the eastern side of the KBML) was also rifted away from the Idaho batholith, and also rotated about 50 degrees, but about a point near the Wallula Gap (or perhaps further east).
In the resulting gap the crust was stretched and thinned; the buoyancy of the hotter mantle have contributed to the subsequent rise of the Wallowa and Seven Devils Mountains, and perhaps also with the irruption of the Columbia River basalts and other basalt flows.
While the rigid-block rotation model has much appeal, many geologists prefer another interpretation that minimizes whole–block rotation, and instead of rifting invokes "dextral shear" (resulting from the relative motion of the Pacific plate past the North American plate, or possibly from the extension of the Basin and Range province) as the primary driving force. The large values of paleomagnetic rotation are explained by a "ball bearing" model: the entire Oregon block (western Oregon including the Cascades and southwestern Washington) are deemed to be composed of many smaller blocks (on the scale of tens of kilometers), each of which rotates independently on its own axis.
Evidence of such small blocks (at least in southwestern Washington) has been claimed.
Later work has attempted to work out how much of the paleomagnetic rotation reflects actual block rotation;
although the amount of rotation has been reduced (to perhaps only 28°), it seems it will not entirely go away. How this affects the postulated rifting does not seem to have been addressed. A more recent work based on analysis of GPS measurements concluded that "most of the Pacific Northwest can be described by a few large, rotating, elastic crustal blocks", but noted that in a zone about 50 km wide on the Oregon coast the apparent rotation rate seems to double; this suggests that multiple models may be applicable.
Modern measurements show that the central Oregon is still rotating, with the calculated rotation poles bracketing the Wallula Gap., which is approximately the intersection of the OWL and KBML. It is intriguing to consider whether the KBML has participated in this rotation, but this is unclear; that it is unbent where it crosses the OWL suggests it is not. The OWL seems to be the northern edge of the rotating block, and the paucity of paleomagnetic data to the southeast of the KBML suggests it might be the southern edge. But the details of all this remain murky.
Puget Sound.
Another notable feature that crosses the OWL is Puget Sound, and it is curious to consider the possible implications of a Puget Sound Fault. (Such a fault was once proposed on the basis of certain marine seismic data, but the proposal was stiffly rejected, and now seems to have been abandoned.) Combined terrestrial and bathymetric topography shows a distinct lineament along the west side of Puget Sound from Vashon Island (just north of Tacoma) north to the west side of Holmes Harbor and Saratoga Passage on Whidbey Island (see image). But at Port Madison (at the red bar in the image) it is split by a distinct offset of several miles.
Curiously, the southern section lies in the approximate zone of the OWL. (Note OWL–associated lineaments running parallel to the red line.) This suggests dextral offset along a strike-slip fault. But if that is the case then there should be a major fault in the vicinity of Port Madison and crossing to Seattle (perhaps at the Ship Canal, aligned with the red line) – but for this there is even less evidence then there was for the Puget Sound fault.
The significance of this lineament and its offset is entirely unknown. That it seems to be expressed in Ice Age (16 Ka) deposits implies a very recent but entirely unknown event; but perhaps these recent deposits are only draped over a much older topography. A recent offset might explain the apparent offsetting of north–south glacial drumlins bisected by the Ship Canal, but is not evident in more eastern segments.
Alternately – and this would seem very pertinent in regard of the OWL – perhaps some mechanism other than strike-slip faulting creates these lineaments.
Seattle Fault.
A locally notable feature that crosses the zone of the OWL is the west-east Seattle Fault. This is not a strike-slip fault, but a thrust fault, where a relatively shallow slab of rock from the south is being pushed against and over the northern part. (And over the OWL.) One model has the slab of rock being forced up by some structure about 8 km deep. Another model has the base of the slab (again, about 8 km deep) catching on something, which causes the leading edge to roll. The nature of the underlying structure is not known; geophysical data does not indicate a major fault nor any kind of crustal boundary along the front of the Seattle Fault, nor along the OWL, but this could be due to the limited reach of geophysical methods. Recent geological mapping at the eastern side of the Seattle Fault suggests a decollement (horizontal plane) about 18 km deep.
These models were developed in study of the western segment of the Seattle Fault. In the center segment, where it crosses surface exposures of Eocene rock associated with the OWL, the various strands of the fault – elsewhere fairly orderly – meander. The significance of this and the nature of the interaction with the Eocene rock are also not known.
Examination of the various strands of the Seattle Fault, particularly in the central section, is similarly suggestive of ripples in a flow that is obliquely crossing some deeper sill. This is an intriguing idea that could explain how local and seemingly independent features could be organized from depth, and even across a large scale, but it does not seem to have been considered. This is likely due, in part, to a paucity of information on the nature and structure of the lower crust where such a sill would exist.
Southern Whidbey Island Fault and RMFZ.
The Southern Whidbey Island Fault (SWIF), running nearly parallel to the OWL from Victoria, B.C., southeast to the Cascade foothills to a point northeast of Seattle, is notable as the contact between the Coast Range block of oceanic crust to the west and the Cascades block of pre-Cenozoic continental crust to the east.
It appears to connect with the more southerly oriented right-lateral Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (RMFZ) straddling Rattlesnake Mountain (near North Bend), which shows a similar deep-seated contact between different kinds of basement rock. At the southern end of Rattlesnake Mountain – exactly where the first lineament of the OWL is encountered – at least one strand of the RMFZ (the others are hidden) turns to run by Cedar Falls and up the Cedar River. Other faults to the south also show a similar turn, suggesting a general turning or bending across the OWL, yet such a bend is not apparent in the pattern of physiographic features that express the OWL. With awareness that the Seattle Fault and the RMFZ are the edges of a large sheet of material which is moving north, there is a distinct impression that these faults, and even some of the topographical features, are flowing around the corner of the Snoqualmie Valley. If it seems odd that a mountain should "float" around a valley: bear in mind that while the surface relief is about three-quarters of a kilometer (half a mile) in height, the material flowing could be as much as eighteen kilometers deep. (The analogy of icebergs moving around a submerged sandbar is quite apt.) It is worth noting that Cedar Butte – a minor prominence just east of Cedar Falls – is the southwestern-most exposure in the region of some very old Cretaceaous (pre-Cenozoic) metamorphic rock. It seems quite plausible that there is some well-founded and obdurate obstruction at depth, around which the shallower and younger sedimentary formations are flowing. In such a context the observed arcuate fault bends would be very natural.
Broader context.
It is generally assumed that the pattern of the OWL is a manifestation of some deeper physical structure or process (the "ur-OWL"), which might be elucidated by studying the effects it has on other structures. As has been shown, study of features that should interact with OWL has yielded very little: a tentative age range (between 45 and 17 million years), suggestions that the ur-OWL arises from deep in the crust, and evidence that the OWL is not (contrary to expectations) itself a boundary between oceanic and continental crust.
The lack of results so far suggests that the broader context of the OWL should be considered. Following are some elements of that broader context, which may – or may not – relate in some way to the OWL.
Plate tectonics.
The broadest and fullest context of the OWL is the global system of plate tectonics, driven by convective flows in the Earth's mantle. The primary story on the western margin of North America is the accretion, subduction, obduction, and translation of plates,
micro-plates, terranes, and crustal blocks between the converging Pacific and North American plates. (For an excellent geological history of Washington, including plate tectonics, see the Burke Museum web site.)
The principal tectonic plate in this region (Washington, Oregon, Idaho) is the North American plate, consisting of a craton of ancient, relatively stable continental crust and various additional parts that have been accreted; this is essentially the whole of the North American continent. The interaction of the North American plate with various other plates, terranes, etc., along its western margin is the primary engine of geology in this region.
Since the breakup of the Pangaea supercontinent in the Jurassic (about 250 million years ago) the main tectonic story here has been the North American Plate's subduction of the Farallon Plate (see below) and its remaining fragments (such as the Kula, Juan de Fuca, Gorda, and Explorer plates). As the North American plate overrides the last of each remnant it comes into contact with the Pacific Plate, generally forming a transform fault, such as the Queen Charlotte Fault running north of Vancouver Island, and the San Andreas Fault on the coast of California. Between these is the Cascadia subduction zone, the last portion of a subduction zone that once stretched from Central America to Alaska.
This has not been a steady process. 50 Ma (million years) ago there was a change in the direction of motion of the Pacific plate (as recorded in the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain). This had repercussions on all the adjoining plates, and may have had something to do with initiation of the Straight Creek Fault, and the end of the Laramide orogeny (the uplift of the Rocky Mountains). This event may have set the stage for the OWL, as much of the crust in which it is expressed was formed around that epoch (the early Eocene); this may be when the story of the OWL starts. Other evidence suggests a similar plate reorganization around 80 Ma, possibly connected with the start of the Laramide orogeny. claimed at least five "major chaotic tectonic events since the Triassic". Each of these events is a possible candidate for creating some condition or structure that affected the OWL or ur-OWL, but knowledge of what these events were or their effects is itself still chaotic.
Complicating the geology is a stream of terranes – crustal blocks – that have been streaming north along the continental margin for over 120 Ma (and probably much, much earlier), what has recently been called the "North Pacific Rim orgenic Stream" (NPRS). However, these terranes may be incidental to the OWL, as there are suggestions that local tectonic structures may be substantially affected by deeper and much older (e.g., Precambrian) basement rock, and even lithospheric mantle structures.
Subduction of the Farallon and Kula Plates.
Roughly 205 million years ago (during the Jurassic period) the Pangaea supercontinent began to break up as a rift separated the North American Plate from what is now Europe, and pushed it west against the Farallon Plate. During the subsequent Cretaceous Period (144 to 66 Ma ago) the entire Pacific coast of North America, from Alaska to Central America, was a subduction zone. The Farallon plate is notable for having been very large, and for subducting nearly horizontally under much of the United States and Mexico; it is likely connected with the Laramide Orogeny. About 85 Ma ago the part of the Farallon plate from approximately California to the Gulf of Alaska separated to form the Kula Plate.
The period 48–50 Ma (mid-Eocene) is especially interesting as this is when the subducted Kula—Farallon spreading ridge passed below what is now the OWL. (The Burke Museum has some nice diagrams of this.) This also marks the onset of the Oregon rotation, possibly with rifting along the OWL, and the initiation of the Queen Charlotte and Straight Creek Faults. The timing seems significant, but how all of these might be connected is unknown.
Around 30 Ma ago part of the spreading center between the Farallon Plate and Pacific Plate was subducted under California, putting the Pacific plate into direct contact with the North American plate and creating the San Andreas Fault. The remainder of the Farallon Plate split, with the part to the north becoming the Juan de Fuca Plate; parts of this subsequently broke off to form the Gorda Plate and Explorer Plate. By this time the last of the Kula Plate had been subducted, initiating the Queen Charlotte transform fault on the coast of British Columbia; coastal subduction has been reduced to just the Cascadia Subduction Zone under Oregon and Washington.
Newberry Hotspot Track – Brothers Fault Zone.
The Newberry Hotspot Track – a series of volcanic domes and lava flows closely coincident with the Brothers Fault Zone (BFZ) – is of interest because it is parallel to the OWL. Unlike anything on the OWL, these lava flows can be dated, and they show a westward age progression from an origin at the McDermitt Caldera on the Oregon-Nevada border to the Newberry Volcano. Curiously, the Yellowstone hotspot also appears to have originated in the vicinity of the McDermitt Caldera, and is generally considered to be closely associated with the Newberry magmatism.
But while the track of the Yellowstone hotspot across the Snake River Plain conforms to what is expected from the motion of the North American Plate across some sort of "hotspot" fixed in the underlying mantle, the Newberry "hotspot" track is oblique to the motion of the North American Plate; this is inconsistent with the hotspot model.
Alternative models include: 1) flow of material from the top layer of the mantle (asthenosphere) around the edge of the Juan de Fuca Plate (a.k.a. "Vancouver slab", 2) flows reflecting lithospheric topography (such as the edge of the craton), 3) faulting in the lithosphere, or 4) extension of the Basin and Range province (which in turn may be due to interactions between the North American, Pacific, and Farallon Plates, and possibly with the subduction of the triple point where the three plates came together), but none is yet fully accepted.
These models generally attempt to account only for the source of the Newberry magmatism, attributing the "track" to pre-existing weakness in the crust. No model yet accounts for the particular orientation of the BFZ, or the parallel Eugene-Denio or Mendocino Fault Zones (see map).
Bermuda Hotspot Track?
It was noted as early as 1963 that the OWL seems to align with the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain. A 1983 paper by Morgan suggested that this seamount—OWL alignment marks the passage some 150 Ma ago of the Bermuda hotspot. (This same passage has also been invoked to explain the Mississippi Embayment.) However, substantial doubt has been raised as to whether Bermuda is truly a "hotspot", and lacking any supporting evidence this putative hotspot track is entirely speculative.
The 1983 paper also suggested that passage of a hot spot weakens the continental crust, leaving it vulnerable to rifting. But might the relation might actually run the other way: do some of these "hotspots" accumulate in zones where the crust is already weakened (by means as yet unknown)? The supposed Newberry hotspot track may exemplify this (see Megashears, below), but application of this concept more generally is not yet accepted. Application to the OWL would require resolving some other questions, such as how traces of a ca. 150 Ma event resisted being swept north into Alaska to influence a structure believed to be no older than 41 Ma (see Straight Creek Fault). Possibly there is some explanation, but geology has not yet found it.
Orofino Shear Zone.
The OWL gets faint, perhaps even terminates, just east of the Oregon—Idaho border where it hits the north-trending "Western Idaho Shear Zone" (WISZ), a nearly vertical tectonic boundary between the accreted oceanic terranes to the west and the plutonic and metamorphic rock of the North American craton (the ancient continental core) to the east. From the Mesozoic till about 90 Ma (mid-Cretaceous) this was the western margin of the North American continent, into which various off-shore terranes were crashing into and then sliding to the north.
Near the town of Orofino (just east of Lewiston, Idaho) something curious happens: the craton margin makes a sharp right-angle bend to the west. What actually happens is the truncation of the WISZ by the WNW-trending "Orofino Shear Zone" (OSZ), which can be traced west roughly parallel with the OWL until it disappears below the Columbia River Basalts, and southeast across Idaho and possibly beyond. The truncation occurred between 90 to 70 Ma ago, possibly due to the docking of the Insular super-terrane (now the coast of British Columbia). This was a major left-lateral transform fault, with the northern continuation of the WISZ believed to be one of the faults in the North Cascades. A similar offset is seen between the Canadian Rocky Mountains in British Columbia and the American Rocky Mountains in southern Idaho and western Wyoming.
Then another curious thing happens: before the west-trending craton margin turns north, it seems to loop south towards Walla Walla (near the Oregon border) and the Wallula Gap (see orange-line here, or dashed-line here). (Although southeastern Washington is pretty thoroughly covered by the Columbia River Basalts, a borehole in this loop recovered rock characteristic of the craton.) It seems that the OSZ may have been offset, perhaps by the Hite Fault, but, contrary to the regional trend, headed south. If this is a cross-cutting offset it would have to be younger than the OFZ (less than 70 Ma), and older than the OWL, which it does not offset. That the OWL and the OFZ are parallel (along with many other structures) suggests something in common, perhaps a connection at a deeper level. But this offsetting relationship indicates that they were created separately.
Megashears.
The OFZ (also called the Trans-Idaho Discontinuity) is a local segment of a larger structure that has only recently been recognized, the "Great Divide Megashear". East of the WISZ this turns to the southeast (much as the OWL may be doing past the Wallula Gap) to follow the Clearwater fault zone down the continental divide near the Idaho—Montana border to the northwestern corner of Wyoming. From there it seems to connect with the Snake River—Wichita fault zone, which passes through Colorado, and Oklahoma., and possibly further. 
There is a significant age discrepancy here. Whereas the OFZ is a mere 90 to 70 Ma old, this megashear is ancient, having been dated to the Mesoproterozoic – about a billion years ago. The Snake River—Wichita fault zone is of a similar age. What appears to be happening is exploitation of ancient weaknesses in the crust. This could explain the Newberry "hotspot track": parallel weaknesses in the crust open as the Brothers, Eugene—Denio, and Mendocino Fault Zones in response to development of the Basin and Range Province; magma from the event that initiated the Yellowstone hotspot (and possibly the Columbia River and other basalt flows) simply exploits the faults of the Brothers Fault Zone. The other faults do not develop as "hotspot tracks" simply because there is no magma source nearby. Similarly, it may be that the OWL reflects a similar zone of weakness, but does not develop as a major fault zone because it is too far from the stresses of the Basin and Range Province.
This could also explain why the OWL seems possibly aligned with the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain in the Gulf of Alaska, especially as the apparent motion is the wrong direction for the OWL to be a mark of their past passage. They are also on the other side of the spreading centers, though that does suggest a pure speculation that these postulated zones of weakness could be related to transform faults from the spreading center.
Precambrian basement.
Following the Great Divide Megashear into the mid-continent reveals something interesting: a widespread pattern of similarly trending (roughly NW-SE) fault zones, rifts, and aeromagnetic and gravitational anomalies. Although some of the faults are recent, the NW trending zones themselves have been attributed to continental-scale transcurrent shearing at about 1.5 Ga – that's "billions" of years ago – during the assembly of Laurentia (the North American continent).
Curiously, there is another widespread pattern of parallel fault zones, etc., of various ages trending roughly NE-SW, including the Midcontinent Rift System, the Reelfoot Rift (in the New Madrid Seismic Zone), and others. These fault zones and rifts occur on tectonic boundaries that date to the Proterozoic – that is, 1.8 to 1.6 billions of years old. They are also roughly parallel to the Ouachita— Appalachian mountains, raised when Laurentia merged with the other continents to form the Pangaea supercontinent some 350 million years ago. It is now believed that these two predominant patterns reflect ancient weaknesses in the underlying Precambrian basement rock, which can be reactivated to control the orientation of features formed much later.
Such linkage of older and younger features seems very relevant to the OWL's troubling age relationships. The possible involvement of the deep Precambrian basement does suggest that what we see as the OWL might be just the expression in shallower and transitory terranes and surface processes of a deeper and persistent ur-OWL, just as ripples in a stream may reflect a submerged rock, and suggests that surficial expression of the OWL may need to be distinguished from a deepr ur-OWL. But neither the applicability of this to the OWL nor any details have been worked out.
Puzzle pieces.
How any of the broader context relates to the OWL is unknown, as nothing is known of the nature of the ur-OWL. When the story is finally known it may be that the significance of some of these elements is in their non-significance.
In attempting to solve puzzles it is often the case that pieces seem impossible to fit – until we discover we have been holding them the wrong way. It is often the same way with scientific puzzles. In an article titled "The value of outrageous geological hypotheses", mentioned "the Wegener outrage of wandering continents". It is instructive to note that the similarity of the western and eastern shores of the Atlantic Ocean – obvious even to a schoolchild – was long a puzzle. It seemed to require choosing between obvious impossibilities: either some kind of control of shore-line building processes over thousands of miles apart, or "wandering continents". Either of these seemed outrageous. Wegener's theory of continental drift, first published in 1912, was rejected on the basis of impossibility until the theory of plate tectonics explained "how" continents could 'wander'. Such reinterpretation of concepts and evidence seems characteristic of the resolution of puzzles; it is intriguing to consider what modifications and extensions will result when the puzzle of the OWL is finally solved.
Retrospectively the solution may seem "obvious", with future generations wondering why we could not sort it out. Perhaps it will be obvious – once we get all the pieces turned around the right way up.

(PDP) to measure the major aspects of self-perception, including an individual’s basic behavior, reaction to environment, and predictable behavior. It was originally developed beginning in 1976 by Dr. Samuel R. Houston, Dr. Dudley Solomon, and Bruce M. Hubby, President of PDP, Inc.
The ProScan Survey contains 60 adjectives drawn from the works of Thurstone, Cattell, Guilford, Fiske, Horst, Daniels, and others. Respondents are requested to react to each adjective on five-point Likert Scale under two separate perceptions, Basic Self and Priority Environment(s). The ProScan Survey typically takes 15 minutes to administer, but has no time constraint. Validity of the instrument has been researched using four well-known approaches--construct, concurrent, predictive, and content validity, and was normed using a cross section of working adults. The survey is intended for the normal segment of society and is no way designed to serve as a pathological finding device nor is it to be used in isolation without considering other factors such as experience, education, references, observations, or other relevant, observable factors.
It classifies the following factors of human behavior:
Dominance: Individuals with high scores on this factor are described as concerned about getting thing done, very competitive, decisive, calculating, and risk takers. Those with low scores are described as non-confrontive, supportive, cautious, and risk avoiders.
Extroversion: Individuals with high scores on this factor are described as outgoing, friendly, optimistic, and persuasive. Those with low scores are described as reserved, quiet, and introspective in social situations.
Pace/Patience: Individuals with high pace/patience scores are described as relaxed, dependable, likable, and at ease or cooperative with their environment. Those with low pace/patience scores are described as intense, action–oriented, pressing, spontaneous, and receptive to change.
Conformity/Structure: Individual with high scores on this factor are described as very precise, dedicated, careful, and concerned about what is “right.” Those with low scores on this factor are described as independent, free thinkers, and non-traditional.
Logic/Rationale: Individuals with high scores on logic/rational are described as fact-oriented and analytical. Those with low scores are described as feeling-oriented and intuitive.
Interpretive reports of the results also provide information describing:
-Energy level
-Environmental stress
-Direction of stress in behavioral changes
-Energy lost due to stress
-Satisfaction/Morale
-Primary and back-up leadership styles
-Primary and back up communication styles
-Primary and back up approaches to task or goals
-Environmental preferences
-Motivators and demotivators
ProScan has been used in a wide variety of professional settings for assistance in hiring, motivating, coaching, and managing employees. Some of the fields in which ProScan has been used include education, financial services, hotel management, software companies, and the trucking industry.

David Huerta

David Huerta, born in Mexico City in 1949, is a Mexican poet and the son of well-known poet Efraín Huerta.
Biography.
As the son of the renowned Mexican poet Efraín Huerta, David was immersed since childhood in Mexico's literary environment. He studied Philosophy, and English and Spanish literature at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). There he met Rubén Bonifaz Nuño and Jesus Arellano, who published his first book of poems, "The Garden of Light".
Huerta has spent many years translating and editing for the Fondo de Cultura Economica, an institution where he directs the magazine "La Gaceta del FCE". In addition to his poetry and essays, he writes an opinion column in the political weekly "Process". David Huerta has opposed cuts to the cultural budget by the Mexican government, struggling in particular to preserve the home of the poet Ramón López Velarde (whose library is named after Huerta's father Efraín Huerta), which has often been threatened by a shortage of resources. 
David has received numerous awards, most notably the Carlos Pellicer poetry award in 1990 and the Xavier Villaurrutia Prize in 2006. He has also been a Fellow of the Mexican Writers' Center (1970-1971), the Guggenheim Foundation (1978-1979), and the Fund for Culture and the Arts (FONCA).

Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional election, 1978

The Friuli-Venezia Giulia regional election of 1978 took place on 25 June 1978.
Christian Democracy was by far the largest party, largely ahead of the Italian Communist Party which came second. The regionalist parties, Friuli Movement, Slovene Union and the recently formed List for Trieste (which stole many votes from the mainstream social-democratic parties), had a total score of more than 10% for the first time.
After the election Antonio Comelli, the incumbent Christian Democratic President, formed a one-party government. In 1980 he managed to enlarge his cabinet to the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the Italian Republican Party and the Italian Liberal Party.

Lwów Scientific Society (Polish: Towarzystwo Naukowe we Lwowie) was a Polish scientific society, founded in 1901 in Lwów by Oswald Balzer as "Association of Support of Polish Sciences". In 1920, the name was changed into "Lwów Scientific Society", and after World War II, when the city of Lwów was annexed by the Soviet Union, the Society was moved to Wrocław, where it exists under the name "Wrocław Scientific Society".
The Society was the most important of the scientific organizations of Lwów. Its purpose was development and progress of sciences in all areas of human knowledge. It was divided into three departments:
Also, there was a section of history of arts and culture. 
Every year in June, a general meeting was called in which the director and secretary general made a report on Society’s activities. It was financed by the Polish government as well as its own foundation and private donors. Members of the Society were divided into active and adopted, most of them were professors of Lwów’s colleges. In 1927, the Society was directed by Oswald Balzer, and the deputy was Władysław Abraham.
Among members of the Society were such renowned names as Jan Baudouin de Courtenay, Aleksander Bruckner, Stefan Banach, Henryk Arctowski, Benedykt Dybowski, Hugo Steinhaus and Rudolf Weigl.

<doc id="21494751" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21494751" title="Road Safety Authority">
Road Safety Authority

The Road Safety Authority () or RSA, is a state agency formed by the Irish Government to promote road safety. The agency has devolved control of much of the work of the Department of Transport.
History and Governance.
It was established in September 2006, charged with the task of improving safety on Irish roads and established under the "Road Safety Authority Act 2006", in response to the high amount of deaths on Irish roads.
The organisation's headquarters are located at Primrose Hill, Ballina, Co. Mayo. The current chairperson of the RSA is veteran TV and radio celebrity, former host of the Late Late Show Gay Byrne. Mr. Byrne secured a second 5 year term in 2011.. However, on 16 June 2014, he announced his intention to step down as Chairman on 5 August 2014.
Some controversy was caused when Mr. Byrne was shown traveling in a car with Terry Wogan when Mr. Byrne appeared not to be wearing his seatbelt. Mr. Byrne has also admitted to drink driving in the past, "but said it was part of the Irish culture at the time."
The RSA was mentioned in relation to public agencies continuing to operate outside of the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, in a speech delivered by Emily O'Reilly in 2010.
In 2013, the CEO of the RSA, Noel Brett stepped down from his position as chief executive of the State-funded Road Safety Authority (RSA) to take up a position as chief lobbyist for the Irish Banking Federation :
""His appointment will come as a surprise given his lack of experience in the financial services sector, especially when the main banks in Ireland are striving to return to profitability and are under significant pressure to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears.""http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/road-safety-chief-noel-brett-appointed-as-head-of-banking-industry-lobby-group-1.1488761
Functions.
Amongst the functions of the RSA are the promotion of road safety, research on accidents and road safety, driver testing and licensing, as well as establishing vehicle-related and other safe driving standards.
The RSA and An Garda Síochána enforce the licensing provisions of the Road Transport Acts: "As well as a fine, if you are an unlicensed haulier you can expect the RSA to look closely at your compliance with other laws, such as those covering: Drivers’ hours rules, Road traffic requirements, Roadworthiness of your vehicles and trailers."
The RSA is also responsible for monitoring progress of The National Road Safety Strategy (2007-2012) which aims to reduce collisions, deaths and injuries on Irish roads by 30%. Achieving this would bring Ireland in line with countries that are considered to have the safest roads in the world – such as Holland, Sweden and the UK.
Under the banner of NDLS ( National Driver Licence Service ) the RSA is now responsible for the issuing of driving licences in Ireland.
Initiatives.
The RSA's "He drives, she dies" campaign, which aimed to raise awareness among female drivers of the risks of getting into cars with men they feel may not drive safely, came in for some criticism in the Irish media. The country's Broadcasting Complaints Commission also received a number of complaints from members of the public relating to the campaign. RSA Chief Executive Noel Brett defended the campaign as justified by accident statistics, saying that "women need to know that they are being killed through male-dominated driver errors such as speeding and drink driving," adding "male drivers are four times more likely to be involved in a fatal collision than a female driver." 
The authority subsequently announced it was considering a number of practical options to further its aim to cut death rates among the country's young male drivers, including the possibility of a late-night driving curfew for all male drivers under the age of 25.
Other recent initiatives include the recommendation of a number of changes to Ireland's National Car Test, which is supervised by the RSA, requiring vehicles older than ten years to be tested every year as opposed to biennially, while stricter controls will be introduced on non-functioning fault warning lights, overly noisy exhausts, and tinted windows and windscreens.
In 2008 the Road Safety Authority received information from vehicle checking agency Cartell about the issue of written off cars from the UK being imported, repaired and registered for use in Ireland. The subsequent "Irish Times" article provoked an investigation by the Garda Siochána, Vehicle Registration Unit, Road Safety Authority and Revenue Commissioners. This resulted in a change to legislation so that from September 2010 all imported vehicles must be taken to a National Car Test Centre for inspection before being registered in Ireland.
In October 2009, it was announced that the RSA had struck an agreement under which the disqualification of drivers in Ireland and in the UK will be mutually recognised. The accord, which is the first such deal between two EU member states, will come into effect in February 2010.
In 2011 RTE revealed that individuals in some of the National Car Testing Service centres could issue an NCT car safety certificate on payment of €100 for cars with serious safety defects. The tests are subcontracted to and conducted by Applus.
In June 2011 Ireland's improvement in reducing road safety fatalities enabled it to be ranked in sixth place for road safety in the EU. The RSA stated: "The number of Irish road deaths fell to 212 in 2010, the lowest level on record, down 26 from 2009. The Government’s road safety target of achieving no more than 252 deaths per annum by the end of 2012 was achieved three years ahead of schedule."
On 5 October 2011, the RSA announced a joint venture with the Irish Tyre Industry Association with the intention of promoting a "tyre safety" week. Two days later the RSA issued a fresh announcement distancing itself from the practical demonstration of vehicle stopping distances it had earlier endorsed after it was alleged that one of the test vehicles used in the tyre safety demonstration had had its ABS braking system disabled.
In 2012, the RSA, having been consulted to offer an opinion on a TV advertisement for Meteor (a mobile telephone service provider), concluded that "they were of the view that the advertisement promoted highly dangerous road user behaviour."
The advertisement included a comedic segment showing a cyclist following a bus to receive free wifi.
Whilst the cyclist depicted in the Meteor ad was wearing a helmet, he was using a mobile phone whilst riding a bicycle.

Verde por fora, vermelho por dentro

Verde por fora, vermelho por dentro ("Green outside, red inside") is a 1979 Portuguese feature film directed and produced by Ricardo Costa.
History.
"Verde por fora, vermelho por dentro", in the panorama of the Portuguese cinema of the late 1990s, was an exception as far as, contrary to the national production of this time, was produced with no state funds. It is the first fictional film directed by Ricardo Costa, who is mainly devoted to documentary film and docufiction. Although conceived as a linear narrative, it subverts this classification since it finishes at the story departure point, a burial scene. Together with this stratagem, unreal and subjective situations interfere in order to generate a metaphor of the social and political country’s situation, affected by the recent Carnation Revolution. Facing the neorealistic tendency of the Portuguese films of its time, it caricaturizes politics and social agents in a surrealistic mood. It was highly controversial.
Synopsis.
"A middle-aged businessman, a neoliberal, returns to Portugal after the Carnation Revolution to realise the ambitious dream of a banana plantation and help reconstruct the national economy, weakened by the "communists". He fails. He even fails his death, from which he mysteriously escapes. To be continued ?"

Broadcast history.
"Concert Tonight" first aired from December 30, 1953 to March 31, 1954, then was brought back from September 15, 1954 to April 6, 1955. During the 1954-55 season, "Concert Tonight" aired Wednesdays at 9 pm EST. 
DuMont broadcast many music-based programs, including this one, which featured the Chicago Symphony performing an hour of music. The series was broadcast from DuMont affiliate WGN-TV in Chicago.
Episode status.
One episode survives at the UCLA Film and Television Archive, while the November 18, 1953 episode survives as part of the Peabody Award collection. Edie Adams, an actress and singer who worked at DuMont before the network ceased broadcasting during 1956, claimed that so little value was given to DuMont's programs that in the late 1970s they were loaded onto three trucks and dumped into Upper New York Bay.
Several episodes from the 1950s of the Chicago Symphony being conducted by Fritz Reiner (as well as by George Szell) have survived and are available on DVD.

Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland

The Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland (ABC,ABCi and ABCI) is a Baptist Christian denomination based in Ireland. It is a group of 121 autonomous Baptist churches working together in fellowship and evangelism, training and caring ministries. The Association only acts on behalf of the churches for the work which the churches have agreed to do together.
History.
Baptist work was started in Ireland by the middle of the 17th century. By 1653, there were 10 churches (9 in the south and 1 in the north). The Irish Baptist Association was organised in 1862, and was replaced by the Baptist Union of Ireland in 1895. Irish Baptists initially had a close relationship with the English Baptists. But desire for independence caused the Irish Baptists to follow their own path and they set up the Union in 1895. Initially there were 15 churches. They supported Charles Spurgeon during the Downgrade Controversy that raged in the Baptist Union of Great Britain. The Union returned to its original name of the Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland in 1999 highlighting that they are an association of churches of like mind which seek to work and fellowship together.
Organisation.
The Association comprises 115 Baptist churches. These member churches have over 8,500 members with a worshipping congregation of over 20,000 each Sunday. Departments include Baptist Women, Baptist Youth, Missions, Welfare, and Training (Irish Baptist Historical Society and Irish Baptist College). The ABC Insight is a bi-monthly magazine serving the churches. The Baptist Centre comprising the administrative offices and the Irish Baptist College is located near Moira, County Down, Northern Ireland. The Association holds an annual assembly in May. The Churches Council meets during the week of the annual assembly and also annually in November. The purpose of the Council is to hear reports and conduct business. Matters are handled between sessions by the Executive Committee elected by the churches at the May Churches Council meeting.
Churches' Council.
Each church appoints at least two representatives to serve on the Churches' Council. This body meets twice each year. It is the final authority within the Association. It appoints the committees and Association Officers, approves the policy and practice of the Association and reviews the work undertaken on behalf of the churches.
Between meetings of the Churches' Council the work of the Association is under the control of the Executive Committee of 18 Church Representatives appointed by the Council from among their number and the Association Officers.
The officers of the Association are: President, Vice-President, Ex-President, Honorary Treasurer and Association Director (Association Director is based at the Baptist Centre. They meet with the Executive Committee and deal with matters of urgency arising between meetings.
Executive Committee.
Between meetings of the Churches' Council the work of the Association is under the control of the Executive Committee of 18 church representatives appointed by the Council from among their number and the Association officers.
Management Committees.
The Churches' Council also appoints the Management Committees to oversee the various areas of Association work. There are 8 Management Committees:

Armet Davis Newlove Architects

Armét Davis Newlove Architects, formerly Armét & Davis, is a California based architectural firm known for working in the Googie architecture style that marks many distinctive coffee shops and eateries in Southern California. The firm designed Pann's, the first Norms Restaurants location, the Holiday Bowl and many other iconic locations.
History.
The architectural firm was formed by Louis Armét and Eldon Davis in 1947. Victor Newlove joined the practice in 1963 and became a partner in 1972, changing the firm's name to Armét Davis Newlove Architects. According to the firm's website, it has designed over 4,000 buildings in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Indonesia.
Some of the firm's design hallmarks included radically vaulted roofing, a room-length dining counter and an outsized comet-shaped signage to beckon drivers from off the street. Armét & Davis have been referred to as "the Frank Lloyd Wright of '50s coffee shops." "According to critic Philip Langdon, Armét & Davis designs came to define 'coffee shop' for much of America." Their Holiday Bowl bowling alley served cultural, architectural, and recreational purposes for the Crenshaw district. The firm is said to have "defined '50s Googie architecture." 
Pann's was designed by Helen Fong, who joined the firm in 1951, and included tropical landscaping. She also designed the Holiday Bowl, Johnie's coffee shop, and the original Norms Restaurant. On the 90th birthday of Eldon Davis, fans joined him for a meal at Norms and a tour of some of the buildings the firm designed. The firm also designed Schwab's Drugstore on Sunset Boulevard.
Photographer Jack Laxer who did stereo pictures (3-D when polarized glasses are worn) took photos of the firm's work. He took photos with stereographic film of the Holiday Bowl bowling alley on Crenshaw Boulevard (circa 1957) and Norms Restaurant on Slauson Avenue. Armét & Davis was one of his key clients.
The firm also designed hotels, such as a Sheraton in Canada, a Lutheran church, animal shelter and schools. L&B Manufacturing in Santa Monica produced seating for many of the coffee shops that were designed by Armét & Davis

Cini Foundation

The Giorgio Cini Foundation (Italian Fondazione Giorgio Cini), or just Cini Foundation, is a cultural foundation founded April 20, 1951 in memory of Count .
History.
The Foundation is located in the former San Giorgio Monastery on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice. It was established by Count Vittorio Cini in memory of his son who died in an airplane accident near Cannes in 1949. Vittorio Cini had been arrested by the SS during World War II and sent to the Dachau concentration camp. His son Giorgio was able to get him released by bribing officials with diamonds and jewellery.
Purpose and collections.
Part of the original purpose of the Foundation was to rebuild the convent that had been destroyed by Napoleon and later used by the Austrian Army, then the Italian Army, and rehabilitate the island within the context of the cultural history of Venice. It now houses a historical library of about 15 000 volumes, an archive of manuscripts, and a collection concerning documents about history, music, theater and art. It is also a venue for exhibitions, concerts and meetings. As such it was a meeting place for the G7 meetings in 1980 and 1987.
The Foundation possess manuscripts and letters of famous persons of the theatrical and literary life of Italy at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth century, including Arrigo Boito, Eleonora Duse, Gabriele D'Annunzio, Giovanni Pascoli, Gian Francesco Malipiero, and . The Malipiero collection includes the library of the composer as well as scores, correspondence and many musical autographs. The Foundation also retains most of the music by Nino Rota, including a collection of sketches.
The Foundation also is home to the "School of San Giorgio for the Study of Venetian Civilisation", an academic center to examine the contributions of the Republic of Venice to civilization.
La Foresteria.
The Foresteria are the exclusive guest quarters that were built for Cini's friends and have been reserved for important guests who attend meetings at the Cini foundation. Filled with valuable art and presenting across the water a view of St. Mark's Square and the Doge's Palace, the place has been visited by heads of state including Jimmy Carter, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, François Mitterrand, Romano Prodi, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, and King Juan Carlos of Spain.

<doc id="21494848" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21494848" title="Racism in Cuba">
Racism in Cuba

Racism in Cuba refers to racial discrimination against Afro-Cuban or mulatto communities.
Background.
The Cuban census reports that 65% of the population is white while foreign figures report an estimate of the number of whites at anywhere from 20 to 35 percent. "The Economist" states that, although the population is now mainly black or mulatto and young, its rulers form "a mainly white gerontocracy".
History.
According to Voyages - The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database, about 900,000 Africans were brought to Cuba as slaves. To compare, some 470,000 Africans were brought to what is now the United States, and 5,500,000 to the much vaster region of what is now Brazil. Slavery in Cuba was abolished in 1886, on a Royal Order by Regent Queen María Cristina of Spain.
Esteban Morales Dominguez has pointed to institutionalized racism in his book "The Challenges of the Racial Problem in Cuba" (). The book, which was published by Fundación Fernando Ortíz, a Cuban official publishing house, is allegedly banned in Cuba according to New America Media, (even though it is featured in Fundación Fernando Ortíz's website as item #29 of their collection "La Fuente Viva", and is even called an "official document" by Carlos Moore, which would strongly indicate it is actually available in Cuba). A report from AfroCubaWeb disputes this weird claim about the ban on the book.
A survey showed that white Cubans believe that blacks are "less intelligent than whites" (58%) and "devoid of decency" (69%). "Racial Politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba" by Mark Q. Sawyer discusses the racial ideology prevalent in the country.
According to anthropologists dispatched by the European Union (EU), racism in Cuban is systemic and institutional. Black people are systematically excluded from positions in tourism-related jobs, where they could earn tips in hard currencies. According to the EU study, black people are relegated to poor housing, were excluded from managerial positions, received the lowest remittances from relatives abroad, and were five times more likely to be imprisoned. Blacks also complained of suffering the longest waits in healthcare.
Esteban Morales Domínguez, a professor in the University of Havana, believes that "the absence of the debate on the racial problem already threatens {...} the revolution's social project". Carlos Moore, who has written extensively on the issue, says that "there is an unstated threat, blacks in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail. Therefore the struggle in Cuba is different. There cannot be a civil rights movement. You will have instantly 10,000 black people dead". He says that a new generation of black Cubans are looking at politics in another way. Barack Obama's victory has raised disturbing questions about the institutional racism in Cuba. "The Economist" noted, "The danger starts with his example: after all, a young, black, progressive politician has no chance of reaching the highest office in Cuba, although a majority of the island’s people are black."
Jorge Luis García Pérez, who was imprisoned for 17 years, states that "the authorities in my country have never tolerated that a black person oppose the regime. During the trial, the color of my skin aggravated the situation. Later when I was mistreated in prison by guards, they always referred to me as being black".
As a black prisoner of conscience, Oscar Elias Biscet wrote to Coretta Scott King in January 1999, "They Cubans have a very low political, economic, and judicial representation in contrast to the numerous prevailing black penal population. This situation is never publicly manifested by the government but is a component of Communism's subtle politics of segregation." Black Cubans such as Biscet and Jorge Luis Garcia Perez have been allegedly forcefully separated from their families for criticizing Fidel Castro.
Anti-discrimination laws.
Cuba's leader Fidel Castro was quoted as saying: “One of the most just battles that must be fought, a battle that must be emphasized more and more, which I might call the fourth battle—the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. I repeat: the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. Of all the forms of racial discrimination the worst is the one that limits the colored Cuban's access to jobs.“ Castro pointed to the distinction between social segregation and employment, while placing great emphasis on correcting the latter.
In response to the large degree of racism in the job market, Castro issued anti-discrimination laws. In addition, he attempted to close the class gap between wealthy white Cubans and Afro-Cubans with a massive literacy campaign, among other egalitarian reforms in the early and mid-1960s. Two years after his 1959 speech at the Havana Labor Rally, Castro declared that the age of racism and discrimination was over. In a speech given at the Confederation of Cuban Workers in observance of May Day, Castro declared that the “just laws of the Revolution ended unemployment, put an end to villages without hospitals and schools, enacted laws which ended discrimination, control by monopolies, humiliation, and the suffering of the people.” 
Some sources consider the claim to be premature.
Prevalence.
Research conducted by PhD researchers Yesilernis Peña, Jim Sidanius and Mark Sawyer in 2003 suggested that social discrimination was still prevalent, despite the low levels of economic discrimination. After considering the issue solved, the Cuban government moved beyond the issue of racism. His message marked a shift in Cuban society’s perception of racism that was triggered by the change in government focus.”
Many who argue that Cuba is not racist base their claims on the idea of Latin American Exceptionalism. According to this argument, a social history of intermarriage and mixing of the races is unique to Latin America. The large mestizo populations that result from high levels of interracial union common to the region are often linked to racial democracy. For many Cubans this translates into an argument of “racial harmony”, often referred to as racial democracy. According to Mark Q. Sawyer, in the case of Cuba, ideas of Latin American Exceptionalism have delayed the progress of true racial harmony.
Frommer's Cuba travel guidebook warns that black tourists can have a hard time entering hotels and restaurants because they are sometimes mistaken for Cuban prostitutes by the security forces (see also Tourist apartheid).

Ebenezer Bible College and Seminary

The Ebenezer Bible College and Seminary (Abbreviated E.B.C.S) is a CAMACOP Bible institution in Zamboanga City, Philippines. It's the first and the largest by area Bible institution of CAMACOP.
History.
When C&MA missionaries arrived at Zamboanga City in the 1900s, they realized they need a Bible school to train Filipinos in the way of the Lord. Ebenezer was built upon a foundation of two Christian day schools known as the Ebenezer Schools. The first school was for girls which was established by Rev. & Mrs. David Lund in 1911 and the school for boys was established in 1920. Then in 1926, the two schools were merged to form the Ebenezer Bible Institute with Rev. George Sthrom as its first principal. When the Second World War arrived in the Philippines, the school temporarily suspended its classes. Classes were only resumed in 1946 by Rev. Herbert Jackson. For the first times in 1950, the Ebenezer Principal went to a Filipino, Rev. Vicente Pada. In June 1962, the Ebenezer School Board voted to rename the school as the Ebenezer Bible College. Principal Pada automatically became its first Director. In 1974, the name of the head of the College was changed to President. In 1984, Dr. Adynna Lim became the first woman head of the institution and served until 1993. After that, Dr. Joel Imbing Ortiz; Dr. Benjamin M. De Jesus and Dr. Joel A. Caperig became presidents of EBCS. Currently, Rev. Roland Don S. Dulaca is the President of EBCS.

Prairie Bluff Chalk Formation

The Prairie Bluff Chalk Formation is a geological formation in North America, within the U.S. state of Alabama. The chalk was formed by marine sediments deposited along the eastern edge of the Mississippi embayment during the Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous. It is a unit of the Selma Group and marks the end of the Cretaceous in Alabama. Evidence has been found within the formation at Braggs, Moscow, and Millers Ferry in Alabama indicating an instantaneous to brief erosional event, most likely a tsunami, at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary). It is hypothesized that this event, along with faulting and liquification of the Prairie Bluff Chalk, is related to the meteorite impact at the Chicxulub crater site, directly south, across the Gulf of Mexico, from the formation.

BC Bike Race

The BC Bike Race is a seven day mountain bike stage race held in British Columbia, Canada. It is traditionally held during the week of Canada Day (July 1). The BC Bike Race claims to have the most singletrack riding of any similar multi-day race.
The Route.
Each year, the BC Bike Race route changes, but has always included Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast, and the Sea to Sky Corridor. The 2010 version of the race involved a Prologue on Vancouver's North Shore, then days in Nanaimo, Cumberland, Powell River, Earls Cover to Sechelt, Sechelt to Langdale, Squamish, and Whistler. The 2011 route is yet to be announced.
The event now contains two versions of the race. The Epic (run since 2007) is seven days of racing with the average course length of 60 km each day. The Challenge (run since 2010) is also seven days, but sports an average of 30 km each day. Both options take place at the same time and incorporate the same Base Camps each day.
Teams.
In 2007 and 2008, racers had to compete as part of a team. Now, BC Bike Race offers a Solo option. Most categories are for teams of two: Open Men, Open Women, Open Mixed, Veterans 80+ (combined age of both riders is over eighty), and Veterans 100+ (combined age over one hundred). Solo categories are Open Men, Men 40+, Open Women, Women 40+. There is one recreational category for teams of three to five people where at least one rider must race each day for the team to be officially ranked. Teammates must stay within two minutes of each other during the stage or risk a time penalty.
In 2010, a shorter version of the race called the "Challenge" was introduced. Participants could compete in either the Solo of Team of Two categories. The standard version of BC Bike Race is now referred to as the "Epic".
Guest Racers.
The race has been known to extend invitations to certain riders to compete as a celebrity guest on certain stages. Past guests include Trevor Linden (Ex-Captain of the Vancouver Canucks).

TurnKey Linux Virtual Appliance Library

The Turnkey Linux Virtual Appliance Library is a free open source project which has developed a range of Debian based pre-packaged server software appliances (aka virtual appliances). Turnkey appliances can be deployed as a virtual machine (a range of hypervisors are supported), in cloud computing infrastructures (including AWS and others) or installed in physical computers.
Features.
Each virtual appliance is a ready-to-use solution that's optimized for ease of use in server-type usage scenarios. Each appliance is designed to "just work" with little to no configuration required.
The project currently maintains over 100+ virtual appliances, which are packaged in multiple build formats:
Pre-integrated server applications include LAMP, WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Redmine, MySQL, MediaWiki, Domain controller, File server, Ruby on Rails, phpBB, and many others.
History.
Founded by engineers of an Israeli startup, the project was conceived in mid-2008 as a community-oriented open source project that would focus on helping users piece together turnkey solutions from open source components in the largest Linux distributions. According to one of TurnKey Linux's co-founders, the project was in part inspired by a desire to provide open source alternatives to proprietary virtual appliance vendors that would be aligned with user interests and could engage the community.
The project launched in September 2008 with three prototype appliances for Drupal, Joomla and LAMP, based on the Ubuntu 8.04.1 build. In the following months usability was improved and a dozen additional appliances were released including Ruby on Rails, MediaWiki and Django.
In October 2009, the project released 40 appliances based on Ubuntu 8.04.3 including 25 new additions to the virtual appliance library. The release included support for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and a new Virtual Machine image format with OVF support.
TurnKey Linux was listed as a winner of the 2009 "Bossies" by InfoWorld as one of the "Top 40 open source products" of that year.
Turnkey Linux was nominated for the SourceForge February 2012 Project of the Month
In August 2012, version 12.0 was released with the library increased to include over 100 appliances. This release also marked a move away from Ubuntu as the underlying Operating System to Debian 6.0 (aka Squeeze). This move was cited as being for various reasons, particularly security.
Early June 2013 saw a significant change of tack with the version 12.1 update release; built with the new "TKLDev" open build infrastructure. This release also included the first X86-64 builds. Later that same month, the Turnkey Linux custom application code was moved to GitHub which also included a tracker for appliances bug reports. As promised, in mid July Turnkey Linux released their image building appliance (TKLDev) as well as an additional separate GitHub account to house all the appliance specific code (used by TKLDev to build the appliances).
November 2013 saw the release of v13.0 which was based on Debian 7.0 (aka Wheezy).
Design.
TurnKey's virtual appliances start life as a "stripped down" Debian bootstrap (versions previous to v12.0 based on Ubuntu.) To this is added the TurnKey Core, which includes all the common features for the project's virtual appliances, including:
The TurnKey Core has a footprint of approximately 110 MB, and is available as a separate download. Application software is installed on top of the Core, which typically increases the size of a virtual appliance up to approximately 160 MB. By downloading and installing the appliance package to the hard drive, it is intended by the developers that administrators would gain an easy method of setting up a dedicated server.
New software appliances, or customised appliances can be developed by forking the appropriate appliance build code on GitHub and then built using TKLDev. Additionally appliances can also be customized and extended using TKLPatch, a simple appliance modification mechanism.
TurnKey Linux can be run as a virtual machine with VirtualBox and VMWare, although the former has been described as having been provided with more documentation.

Vyborg

Vyborg (; ; , ; ; ; ) is a town and the administrative center of Vyborgsky District in Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the Karelian Isthmus near the head of the Vyborg Bay, to the northwest of St. Petersburg and south of Russia's border with Finland, where the Saimaa Canal enters the Gulf of Finland. Population: 
The town lies in the boundary zone between the East Slavic/Russian and Finnish worlds and has changed hands several times in history, most recently in 1944 when it was taken by the Soviet Union from Finland during World War II.
The city hosts the Russian end of the 1,222 km Nord Stream gas pipeline, laid in 2011 and operated by a consortium led by Russia's Gazprom state hydrocarbons enterprise to pump 55 billion cu m of natural gas a year under the Baltic to Greifswald, Germany. 
History.
The area where Vyborg is located used to be a trading center on the Vuoksi River's western branch, which has dried up. The region was inhabited by the Karelians, a Balto-Finnic tribe which gradually came under the domination of Novgorod and Sweden. Vyborg itself appeared in the 11th–12th centuries as a mixed Karelian-Russian settlement.
The first Vyborg Castle was founded during the so-called "Third Swedish Crusade" in 1293 by marshal Torkel Knutsson. The castle was fought over for decades between Sweden and the Novgorod Republic. By the Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323, Vyborg was finally recognized as a part of Sweden. The town's trade privileges were chartered by the Pan-Scandinavian King Eric of Pomerania in 1403. It withstood a prolonged siege by Daniil Shchenya during the Russo–Swedish War of 1496–1497.
Under Swedish rule, Vyborg was closely associated with the noble family of Bååt, originally from Småland. The late-medieval commanders and fief holders of Vyborg were (almost always) descended from or married to the Bååt family. In practice, though not having this as their formal title, they functioned as Margraves, had feudal privileges, and kept all the crown's incomes from the fief to use for the defense of the realm's eastern border.
Vyborg remained in Swedish hands until its capture in 1710 after the Siege of Vyborg by Tsar Peter the Great in the Great Northern War. In the course of Peter's second administrative reform, Vyborg became the seat of Vyborg Province of St. Petersburg Governorate. The 1721 Treaty of Nystad, which concluded the war with Sweden, finalized the transfer of the town and a part of Old Finland to Russia.
In 1744, Vyborg became the seat of Vyborg Governorate. In 1783, the governorate was transformed into Vyborg Viceroyalty, then in 1801 back into Vyborg Governorate. In 1802, Vyborg Governorate was renamed Finland Governorate.
One of the largest naval battles in history, the Battle of Vyborg Bay, was fought off the shore of the Vyborg Bay on July 4, 1790.
After the rest of Finland was ceded to Russia in 1809, Emperor Alexander I incorporated the town and the governorate into the newly created Grand Duchy of Finland in 1811.
In the course of the 19th century, the town developed as the center of administration and trade for the eastern part of Finland. The inauguration of the Saimaa Canal in 1856 benefited the local economy as it opened the vast waterways of Eastern Finland to the sea. Vyborg was never a major industrial center and lacked large production facilities, but due to its location it served as a focal point of transports of all industries on the Karelian Isthmus, Ladoga Karelia, and southeastern Finland.
Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the fall of the Russian Empire, Finland declared itself independent. During the Finnish Civil War, Vyborg was in the hands of the Finnish Red Guards until it was captured by the White Guard on April 29, 1918.
In the inter-war decades, the town, then officially known as Viipuri, was the second biggest town in Finland and the seat of Viipuri Province. In 1939, Vyborg had some 80,000 inhabitants, including sizable minorities of Swedes, Germans, Russians, Gypsies, Tatars, and Jews. During this time, Alvar Aalto built the Vyborg Library—a masterpiece of modern architecture.
During the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland in 1939–1940, over seventy thousand people were evacuated from Vyborg to western Finland. The Winter War was concluded by the Moscow Peace Treaty, which stipulated the transfer of Vyborg and the whole Karelian Isthmus—emptied of their residents—to Soviet control, where it was incorporated into the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic on March 31, 1940. As the town was still held by the Finns, the remaining Finnish population, some ten thousand people, had to be evacuated in haste before the handover. Thus, practically the whole population of Finnish Vyborg was resettled elsewhere in Finland. The town became the administrative center of Vyborgsky District.
The evacuees from Finnish Karelia came to be a vociferous political force and their wish to return to their homes was an important motive when Finland sought support from Nazi Germany against the Soviet threat. As a result, Finland and Nazi Germany fought on the same side in the Continuation War.
On August 29, 1941, Vyborg was recaptured by Finnish troops and, soon after, the Government of Finland formally annexed it along with the other areas lost in the Moscow Peace Treaty. At first, the Finnish Army did not allow civilians into the town. Of the 6,287 buildings, 3,807 had been destroyed. The first civilians started to arrive at the end of September and by the end of the year Vyborg had a population of about 9,700. By 1942, it had risen to 16,000. About 70% of the evacuees from Finnish Karelia returned after the re-conquest to rebuild their looted homes, but were again evacuated after the Red Army's Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, timed to coincide with the Battle of Normandy. By the time of the Soviet offensive, the town had a population of nearly 28,000. The town was evacuated by June 19 and the defense of Vyborg was entrusted to the 20th Brigade. The town fell to the Red Army on June 20, 1944, but the Finns managed to halt the Soviet offensive at the Battle of Tali-Ihantala—the largest battle fought by any of the Nordic countries—in Viipuri rural municipality which surrounded the town. The town was seriously damaged, with many historic buildings, including the Vyborg Cathedral, destroyed.
In the subsequent Moscow Armistice of September 19, 1944, Finland returned to the borders set by the Moscow Peace Treaty and ceded more land than the treaty originally demanded. In the 1947 Paris Peace treaties, Finland relinquished all claims to Viipuri/Vyborg.
After the Winter War, Leningrad Oblast wanted to incorporate the area of Vyborg, but it took until November 1944 for it to be finally transferred from the Karelo-Finnish SSR. During the Soviet era, the town was settled by people from all over the Soviet Union. The naval air bases of Pribilovo and Veshchevo were built nearby.
Administrative and municipal status.
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Vyborg serves as the administrative center of Vyborgsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Vyborgsky District as Vyborgskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Vyborgoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Vyborgy Municipal District as Vyborgoye Urban Settlement.
Economy and culture.
Vyborg continues to be an important industrial producer of paper. Tourism is increasingly important, and the Russian film festival "Window to Europe" takes place in the town each year.
An HVDC back-to-back facility for the exchange of electricity between the Russian and Finnish power grids was completed near Vyborg in 1982. It consists of three bipolar HVDC back-to-back schemes with an operating voltage of 85 kV and a maximum transmission rate of 355 megawatts, so that the entire maximum transmission rate amounts to 1,420 megawatts.
Sights.
Vyborg's most prominent landmark is its Swedish-built castle, started in the 13th century and extensively reconstructed in 1891–1894. The Round Tower and the Rathaus Tower date from the mid-16th century and are parts of the Medieval Vyborg town wall. The Viipuri Library by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto and the Hermitage-Vyborg Center are a reference point in the history of modern architecture.
There are also Russian fortifications, completed by 1740, as well as the monuments to Peter the Great (1910) and Torkel Knutsson. Tourists can also visit the house where the founder of the Soviet state Vladimir Lenin prepared the Bolshevik revolution during his stay in Viipuri from September 24 to October 7, 1917.
Sprawling along the heights adjacent to the Gulf of Finland is Mon Repos, one of the most spacious English landscape gardens in Eastern Europe. The garden was laid out on behest of its owner, Baron Ludwig Heinrich von Nikolay, at the turn of the 19th century. Most of its structures were designed by the architect Giuseppe Antonio Martinelli. Previously, the estate belonged to the future king Frederick I (Maria Fyodorovna's brother), who called it Charlottendahl in honor of his second wife.
Notable people.
Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin lived in the town for a period following the failure of the February Revolution of 1917. Finnish Nobel prize winner Martti Ahtisaari was born in Viipuri in 1937. Cyclist Viatcheslav Ekimov and Formula One driver Vitaly Petrov were born in the town. Finnish soldier Lauri Törni, who received the Mannerheim Cross for his service during the Winter War, was born here, and later served in the Finnish, German, and United States armies.

<doc id="21495014" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21495014" title="Rook (bird)">
Rook (bird)

The rook ("Corvus frugilegus") is a member of the "Corvidae" family in the passerine order of birds. Named by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, the species name "frugilegus" is Latin for "food-gathering".
This species is similar in size (45–47 cm in length) to or slightly smaller than the carrion crow with black feathers often showing a blue or bluish-purple sheen in bright sunlight. The feathers on the head, neck and shoulders are particularly dense and silky. The legs and feet are generally black and the bill grey-black.
Rooks are distinguished from similar members of the crow family by the bare grey-white skin around the base of the adult's bill in front of the eyes. The feathering around the legs also looks shaggier and laxer than the congeneric carrion crow. The juvenile is superficially more similar to the crow because it lacks the bare patch at the base of the bill, but it has a thinner bill and loses the facial feathers after about six months. Collective nouns for rooks include "building", "parliament", "clamour" and "storytelling". Their communal nesting behaviour gave rise to the term rookery.
Distribution and habitat.
Rooks are resident in Great Britain, Ireland and much of north and central Europe but vagrant to Iceland and parts of Scandinavia, where they typically live south of the 60th latitude and in habitats that ravens dislike, such as open agricultural areas. It also occurs as an eastern race in Asia where it differs in being slightly smaller on average, and having a somewhat more fully feathered face. In the north of its range the species has a tendency to move south during autumn though more southern populations are apt to range sporadically also. The species has been introduced to New Zealand, with several hundred birds being released there from 1862 to 1874, though today their range is very localised. There the species is an agricultural pest and it is being eradicated.
Behaviour and ecology.
Diet.
Food is predominantly earthworms and insect larvae, which the bird finds by probing the ground with its strong bill. It also eats cultivated cereal grain, smaller amounts of fruit, small mammals, acorns, small birds, their eggs and young and carrion. In urban sites, human food scraps are taken from rubbish dumps and streets, usually in the early hours when it is relatively quiet. It can also be seen along the seashore, feeding on insects, crustaceans and suitable food flotsam.
Nesting.
Nesting in a rookery is always colonial, usually in the very tops of the trees. Branches and twigs are broken off trees (very rarely picked up off the ground), though as many are likely to be stolen from nearby nests as are collected from trees. Eggs are usually 3–5 in number, can appear by the end of February or early March and are incubated for 16–18 days. Both adults feed the young, which are fledged by the 32nd or 33rd day.
In autumn, the young birds of the summer collect into large flocks together with unpaired birds of previous seasons, often in company with jackdaws. It is during the autumn that spectacular aerial displays can be seen by adult birds that seem to delight in the autumn gales.
Voice.
The call is usually described as "kaah" – it is similar to that of the carrion crow, but usually rather flatter in tone. It is given both in flight and while perched, when the bird fans its tail and bows on each caw. Calls in flight are usually given singly, in contrast to the carrion crow's which are in groups of three or four. Solitary birds often "sing" apparently to themselves, uttering strange clicks, wheezes and almost human-like notes.
Intelligence.
In captivity, when confronted with problems, rooks have been documented as one of several species of birds capable of using tools to achieve a goal. Rooks learned that if they push a stone off a ledge into a tube, they will get food. The rooks then discovered they could find and bring a stone and carry it to the tube if no stone was there already. They also used sticks and wire, and figured out how to bend a wire into a hook to reach an item. Rooks are as clever at making and using simple tools with their beaks as chimpanzees are with their hands.
In an experiment, a rook was placed near a tube of water, with a worm floating on top of the water, and some rocks next to the tube. The water level was too low for the rook to reach the worm, so it placed rocks into the tube until the level was high enough.
Rooks are also known to carry walnuts above busy streets and drop them into traffic, so that cars will run over them and break their hard shells. Rooks then fly down and retrieve the walnut meat (avoiding oncoming cars). Scientists suspect this may be evidence of reasoning capability on the part of rooks.

Union des Banques Congolaises

The Union des Banques Congolaise became bankrupt and in 2006 was merged into the Banque Congolaise.
History.
In 1920, the Banque de Bruxelles established the Crédit General du Congo, with its administrative headquarters in Brussels, and its corporate headquarters in Léopoldville. Shortly thereafter, the CGD established branches in Matadi, Elizabethville, and Stanleyville. In 1929, Banque de Bruxelles transferred the operations of CGD to the newly created Banque Belge d'Afrique. Shortly after the Belgian Congo achieved its independence in 1960, the operations in the Congo became Union Zaïroise de Banques. 
By 1989, the bank's ownership was 25% Banque Bruxelles Lambert, 28% the Government of Zaire, and 48% Societe Financiere pour les Pays d'Outre-mer (SFOM). This Swiss-based holding company had three shareholders - Banque Nationale de Paris with 48%, Dresdner Bank with 26%, and Banque Bruxelles Lambert 26%.
By 1991, Union Zairoise de Banques had 16 offices in Zaire and was the second biggest bank in the country after Banque Commerciale Zairoise. Banque Bruxelles Lambert held 41.5% of its capital, directly and indirectly through SFOM, which was then equally owned by BBL, Deutsche Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris. The Zairean Government held 15% of the capital, a group of private investors another 15%, and the rest was distributed among small investors. 
In 1995, the Zaire government arbitrarily and summarily nationalized the bank, dismissing all its staff. In 2005, the bank's name changed to Union des Banques Congolaises. However, by then the bank was bankrupt and in 2006, the Banque Congolaise acquired it.

Biledulgerid

Biledulgerid (Bheladal Dsherid = country of dates) was formerly a country in Northern Africa, south of Mount Atlas, bounded on the north by Tunis, on the west by Algiers and the Sahara, on the east by Tripoli, supposed to be about 180 miles square.
Contemporary account.
Berbers lived here, along with Negroes and Arabs. A large proportion of the young men are destroyed by the change of climate to which they are thus exposed, as also by bad nourishment and epidemic fevers. Certain parts of this country, called Dara, Tasilet and Segelmesse, belong to Morocco; to Algiers belongs Wadreag, and to Tunis Tozer. Gaelernes, WelledSidi and Mosselemis are independent. Little is known of the customs, laws, &c, of the inhabitants.
One late 18th century source (William Carey, "An Enquiry Into the Obligation of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens") gave the dimensions of Biledulgerid as 2,500 miles in length and 350 miles in breadth with a population of 3.5 million. The country's religions are listed as "Mahometans, Christians, and Jews."

Matt Rees

Matt Rees is a Welsh novelist and journalist. He is the author of The Palestine Quartet, a series of crime novels about Omar Yussef, a Palestinian sleuth, and of historical crime novels. He is the winner of a Crime Writers Association Dagger for his crime fiction.
His first work of nonfiction was "Cain's Field: Faith, Fratricide, and Fear in the Middle East" in 2004 (Free Press).
"The New York Times" called "The Collaborator of Bethlehem", the first of his Palestinian crime novels about Bethlehem sleuth Omar Yussef, “an astonishing first novel.” "The Independent" (London) hailed Omar as “the next big sleuth in crime fiction.” "Le Figaro" called the book “a masterpiece.” Under its UK title "The Bethlehem Murders" the first Omar Yussef novel won the Crime Writers Association's John Creasey New Blood Dagger in 2008.
Rees's writing has been compared with the work of Graham Greene, John Le Carre, Georges Simenon and Henning Mankell. The French magazine L’Express called him “the Dashiell Hammett of Palestine.” Rees's books have sold in 25 languages.
Rees was born in Newport, Wales. As a journalist, Rees covered the Middle East for over a decade. He was "TIME"'s Jerusalem bureau chief from 2000 until 2006, writing award-winning stories about the Palestinian intifada. He also worked as Middle East correspondent for "The Scotsman" and "Newsweek".
Books.
Rees published a nonfiction account of Israeli and Palestinian society called "Cain's Field: Faith, Fratricide, and Fear in the Middle East" in 2004 (Free Press). The book examines the divisions within Israel and within Palestinian society, suggesting that a peace deal would only be possible between the two sides when these internal frictions were resolved.
His first crime novel, "The Collaborator of Bethlehem" (UK title "The Bethlehem Murders"), was published in the U.S. in February 2007 by Soho Press. The novel is set in Bethlehem, West Bank, against the backdrop of the Palestinian intifada and involves the gangs of gunmen operating in the town and the situation of the Christian Palestinian minority. It won the prestigious Crime Writers Association John Creasey New Blood Dagger in 2008, and was also nominated for the Barry First Novel Award, the Macavity First Mystery Award, and the Quill Best Mystery Award. The New York Times called it “an astonishing first novel.” It was named one of the Top 10 Mysteries of the Year by Booklist and, in the UK Sir David Hare made it his Book of the Year in "The Guardian". Colin Dexter, author of the Inspector Morse novels, called Rees’s Palestinian sleuth Omar Yussef “a splendid creation.” Omar was called “Philip Marlowe fed on hummus” by one reviewer and “Yasser Arafat meets Miss Marple” by another.
The second book in the series, "A Grave in Gaza", appeared in February 2008 (and at the same time under the title "The Saladin Murders" in the UK). Omar Yussef travels to Gaza, where he struggles against corrupt security chiefs who are smuggling weapons. The Bookseller called it “a cracking, atmospheric read.” The third book in the series, "The Samaritan’s Secret", was published in February 2009. Set in Nablus, it takes place against the backdrop of the city's ancient casbah and the small community of Samaritans still living on a hilltop overlooking the West Bank town. "The New Republic" called it "a wonderful detective thriller." Rees's fourth novel, "The Fourth Assassin", appeared in February 2010 and showed Omar Yussef to be "one of the most beguiling of current sleuths," according to "The Sunday Times". Omar goes to New York for a UN conference and uncovers an assassination plot.
Rees's novels approach the Middle East conflict from an often unexpected direction. There are almost no Israeli characters, and the novels maintain a focus on Palestinian society, good and bad. Rees has written that this perspective was dictated by his discontent with news reporting of the conflict, which focused on stereotypes of Palestinians as either terrorists or victims. Instead, Rees writes, the diversity of Palestinian society awakened him creatively and made him look at the Middle East from a different angle. For example, Gaza "is the most beautiful spot imaginable," he has said.
"Mozart's Last Aria", published in 2011, is a historical crime novel set in Vienna in 1791. Nannerl Mozart, the great composer's sister, comes to the Imperial capital to investigate Wolfgang's death. She uncovers a plot involving illegal Masonic meetings, espionage, and a secret hidden in her brother's last great opera "The Magic Flute". The book is based on real historical research into Mozart's last days.
"A Name in Blood" follows the mysterious disappearance and death of the Italian artist Caravaggio. Like "Mozart's Last Aria", "A Name in Blood" takes a real historical mystery and new historical research to create a fictional account of what might have happened. The Bookbag recommended "A Name in Blood" "even if you're art-averse."
Rees learned to play piano as part of his research for "Mozart's Last Aria." Working on "A Name in Blood", he learned to paint with oils and to duel using a seventeenth-century rapier. 
In 2012, Rees launched a musical project on his website called "Poisonville", named after the location of Dashiell Hammett's novel "Red Harvest". Poisonville is a free music project recording original songs, most of them written and performed by Rees, about different crime novels. The subjects of the first songs were Rees's novels, as well as books by Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Helen FitzGerald and Jasmine Schwartz.

10 Things I Hate About You (TV series)

10 Things I Hate About You is an American television sitcom broadcast on ABC Family beginning in 2009. Developed by Carter Covington, the show is a half-hour, single camera series based on the 1999 film of the same name. It premiered on Tuesday, July 7, 2009 at 8 pm and brought in 1.60 million viewers, a record for a 30-minute comedy debut on the ABC Family network.
Following its initial 10-episode run, a second set of 10 episodes aired from March 29, 2010 to May 24, 2010. On April 29, executive producer Carter Covington announced on his Twitter account that the series had been canceled by ABC Family due to low ratings. He later revealed his intended storylines for the next season in an interview with "Entertainment Weekly" Popwatch blog.
Plot.
The series is based on the Shakespeare play "The Taming of the Shrew" and the 1999 movie of the same name. The Stratford sisters, Kat (Lindsey Shaw) and Bianca (Meaghan Jette Martin), have just moved from Ohio to California. As they start at their new school (Padua High), they have very different goals. It's clear that one sister wants to stand out and the other just wants to fit in. Kat is a cool, smart, strong-willed, forthright feminist who is looking to save the world and get out of school as fast as she can. When she meets the intense Patrick Verona (Ethan Peck), sparks begin to fly. Bianca is a social butterfly whose main goal in life is to be popular, but when the head cheerleader makes her the mascot, she realizes she has a long way to go. As they start a bumpy year at Padua High, Kat and Bianca attempt to navigate the popular crowd, boys and their over-protective dad (Larry Miller). Bianca tries everything to be popular and become a cheerleader - although getting involved with the boyfriend (Chris Zylka) of the most popular girl in school (Dana Davis) creates new challenges.
Development and production.
In 2008, ABC Family announced their intention to create a comedy pilot based on the 1999 movie. The pilot was written by Carter Covington, a self-professed fan of the original 1999 film. ABC Family green-lit the comedy in October 2008. In November 2008, casting was announced for the pilot, with production following that fall. In February 2009, the pilot was picked up when ABC Family ordered 9 additional episodes.
While Covington sought a "reimagined" adaptation, there are several connections between the pilot and movie, which gave the pilot the same feel. Gil Junger, who directed the movie, also directed the pilot. Richard Gibbs, who is credited for the original music in the 1999 movie, also composed the theme music for the pilot. In addition, Larry Miller reprises his role as the overprotective father, Walter Stratford.
The pilot was shot at a high school in Tujunga, California. Due to budget constraints, future episodes were filmed at a soundstage in Santa Clarita, California, with only occasional external shots in Tujunga.
Covington serves as the series show runner, as well as an executive producer. He has stated that he wants the show "to feel like a John Hughes film every week." Junger has remained on board, and directed seven of the first 10 episodes of the series.
Reception.
"10 Things" has received a score of 67 out of 100 from review aggregator Metacritic. Several critics praised the series for containing clever dialogue and appealing and rooted characters. Brian Lowry of "Variety" described the show as "a solid roll for the cable network that was once an albatross around the neck of parent Disney." One critic proclaimed the series as "best thing that ABC Family has ever produced." Randee Dawn of "The Hollywood Reporter" thought that the series "has genuine appeal."
Less favorable reviews came from Alessandra Stanley of "The New York Times", who called the series "not very inventive," and "The New York Post", whose mixed review concluded that the show is "silly, mindless fun" whose "actors are all terrific in that silly, mindless fun way that Disney teens tend to be."
Mike Hale from "The New York Times" named the show to his top ten in 2009, stating that "in the dog days of July," the sitcom "may have been the best thing on television."
Episodes.
20 episodes were produced, 12 of them directed by Gil Junger, who also directed the original movie.

No Regrets (The Walker Brothers album)

No Regrets is the fourth album by the American pop group The Walker Brothers. The album was released in 1975 and was the group's first together since 1967. It reached number forty-nine on the UK Albums Chart and includes the single "No Regrets". The single backed with the non-album B-side "Remember Me" became the group's final significant hit single, reaching #7 in the UK Singles Chart in early 1976.
The album was significantly different from the group's 60s work. While the arrangements were still grandiose and often utilised an orchestra, the general musical styles were Country and Pop music. The album was also their first not to include original compositions by either Scott Walker or John Walker. John Walker's only new song "Remember Me" was included as the B-side to "No Regrets". The group's following album "Lines" did include a lone John Walker composition under a pseudonym, Scott however would not contribute new songs until 1978's "Nite Flights"
Reception.
"No Regrets" received mixed reviews from the majority of critics. Dave Thompson writing for Allmusic praises the title track calling it "brilliant" and "a gargantuan slab of maudlin sadness that wrung every last iota of pain from Scott's voice". Thompson criticises the rest of the album saying it "stunk", but does praise "He'll Break Your Heart" and "Burn Our Bridges".

Coprine

Coprine is a mycotoxin. It was first isolated from common inkcap ("Coprinopsis atramentaria"). It also occurs in other mushrooms in the genus "Coprinus" and in brawny bolete ("Boletus torsus").
When combined with the consumption of alcohol, it causes "Coprinus syndrome". Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, malaise, agitation, palpitations and tingling in limbs, and arise five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol. The signs are similar to those induced by disulfiram (Antabuse) and subsequent alcohol consumption. If no more alcohol is consumed, the symptoms will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed.
Coprine is metabolized into glutamic acid and 1-aminocyclopropanol, the biologically active substance which inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of alcohol. When it is blocked, acetaldehyde accumulates causing the adverse reaction.

Seismic inversion

Seismic inversion, in Geophysics (primarily Oil and Gas exploration/development), is the process of transforming seismic reflection data into a quantitative rock-property description of a reservoir. Seismic inversion may be pre- or post-stack, deterministic, random or geostatistical, and typically includes other reservoir measurements such as well logs and cores.
Introduction.
Geophysicists routinely perform seismic surveys to gather information about the geology of an oil or gas field. These surveys record sound waves which have traveled through the layers of rock and fluid in the earth. The amplitude and frequency of these waves can be estimated so that any side-lobe and tuning effects introduced by the wavelet may be removed.
Seismic data may be inspected and interpreted on its own without inversion, but this does not provide the most detailed view of the subsurface and can be misleading under certain conditions. Because of its efficiency and quality, most oil and gas companies now use seismic inversion to increase the resolution and reliability of the data and to improve estimation of rock properties including porosity and net pay.
There are many different techniques used in seismic inversion. These can be roughly grouped into two categories:
The combination of these categories yields four technical approaches to the inversion problem, and the selection of a specific technique depends on the desired objective and the characteristics of the subsurface rocks. Although the order presented reflects advances in inversion techniques over the past 20 years, each grouping still has valid uses in particular projects or as part of a larger workflow.
Wavelet estimation.
All modern seismic inversion methods require seismic data and a wavelet estimated from the data. Typically, a reflection coefficient series from a well within the boundaries of the seismic survey is used to estimate the wavelet phase and frequency. Accurate wavelet estimation is critical to the success of any seismic inversion. The inferred shape of the seismic wavelet may strongly influence the seismic inversion results and, thus, subsequent assessments of the reservoir quality.
Wavelet amplitude and phase spectra are estimated statistically from either the seismic data alone or from a combination of seismic data and well control using wells with available sonic and density curves. After the seismic wavelet is estimated, it is used to estimate seismic reflection coefficients in the seismic inversion.
When the estimated (constant) phase of the statistical wavelet is consistent with the final result, the wavelet estimation converges more quickly than when starting with a zero phase assumption. Minor edits and "stretch and squeeze" may be applied to the well to better align the events. Accurate wavelet estimation requires the accurate tie of the impedance log to the seismic. Errors in well tie can result in phase or frequency artifacts in the wavelet estimation. Once the wavelet is identified, seismic inversion computes a synthetic log for every seismic trace. To ensure quality, the inversion result is convolved with the wavelet to produce synthetic seismic traces which are compared to the original seismic.
Components of inversion.
Inversion includes both seismic data and well data, where well data serves to add the low frequency below the seismic band and to constrain the inversion. Well logs are first conditioned and edited to ensure there is a suitable relationship between impedance logs and the desired properties. The logs are then converted to time, filtered to approximate the seismic bandwidth and edited for borehole effects, balanced and classified by quality.
Seismic data is band-limited, reducing resolution and quality. To extend the frequency band available, low-frequency data is derived from log data, pre-stack depth or time migrated velocities and/or a regional gradient. High frequency can be derived from well control or geostatistical analysis.
Initial inversions are often run with relaxed constraints, starting with the seismic and then adding limited-trend data from the wells. This provides a rough overview of the reservoir in an unbiased manner. It is critical at this point to evaluate the accuracy of the tie between the inversion results and the wells, and between the original seismic data and the derived synthetics. It is also important to ensure that the wavelet matches the phase and frequency of seismic data.
Without a wavelet, the solution is not unique. Deterministic inversions address this problem by constraining the answer in some way, usually to well log data. Stochastic inversions address this problem by generating a range of plausible solutions, which can then be narrowed through testing for best fit against various measurements (including production data).
Post-stack seismic resolution inversion.
An example of a post-stack seismic resolution inversion technique is the Constrained Sparse-Spike Inversion (CSSI). This assumes a limited number of reflection coefficients, with larger amplitude. The inversion results in acoustic impedance (AI), which is the product of rock density and p-wave velocity. Unlike seismic reflection data (which is an interface property) AI is a rock property. The model generated is of higher quality, and does not suffer from tuning and interference caused by the wavelet.
CSSI transforms seismic data to a pseudo-acoustic impedance log at every trace. Acoustic impedance is used to produce more accurate and detailed structural and stratigraphic interpretations than can be obtained from seismic (or seismic attribute) interpretation. In many geological environments acoustic impedance has a strong relationship to petrophysical properties such as porosity, lithology, and fluid saturation.
A good (CSSI) algorithm will produce four high-quality acoustic impedance volumes from full or post-stack seismic data: full-bandwidth impedance, bandlimited Impedance, reflectivity model, and low-frequency component. Each of these components can be inspected for its contribution to the solution and to check the results for quality. To further adapt the algorithm mathematics to the behavior of real rocks in the subsurface, some CSSI algorithms use a mixed-norm approach and allow a weighting factor between minimizing the sparsity of the solution and minimizing the misfit of the residual traces.
Pre-stack seismic resolution inversion.
Pre-stack inversion is often used when post-stack inversion fails to sufficiently differentiate geologic features with similar P-impedance signatures. Simultaneous inversion solves for S-impedance and density, in addition to P-impedance. While many geologic features can express similar P-impedance characteristics, few will share combined P-impedance and S-impedance traits (allowing improved separation and clarity). Often a feasibility study using the wells logs will indicate whether separation of the desired lithotype can be achieved with P-impedance alone or whether S-impedance is also required. This will dictate whether a pre- or post-stack inversion is needed.
Simultaneous Inversion (SI) is a pre-stack method that uses multiple offset or angle seismic sub-stacks and their associated wavelets as input; it generates P-impedance, S-impedance and density as outputs (although the density output resolution is rarely as high as the impedances). This helps improve discrimination between lithology, porosity and fluid effects. For each input partial stack, a unique wavelet is estimated. All models, partial stacks and wavelets are input to a single inversion algorithm —enabling inversion to effectively compensate for offset-dependent phase, bandwidth, tuning and NMO stretch effects.
The inversion algorithm works by first estimating angle-dependent P-wave reflectivities for the input-partial stacks. Next, these are used with the full Zoeppritz equations (or approximations, such as Aki-Richards, for some algorithms) to find band-limited elastic reflectivities. These are in turn merged with their low-frequency counterparts from the model and integrated to elastic properties. This approximate result is then improved in a final inversion for P-impedance, S-impedance and density, subject to various hard and soft constraints. One constraint can control the relation between density and compressional velocity; this is necessary when the range of angles is not great enough to be diagnostic of density.
An important part in the inversion procedure is the estimation of the seismic wavelets. This is accomplished by computing a filter that best shapes the angle-dependent well log reflection coefficients in the region of interest to the corresponding offset stack at the well locations. Reflection coefficients are calculated from P-sonic, S-sonic and density logs using the Zoeppritz equations. The wavelets, with amplitudes representative of each offset stack, are input directly into the inversion algorithm. Since a different wavelet is computed for each offset volume, compensation is automatically done for offset-dependent bandwidth, scaling and tuning effects. A near-stack wavelet can be used as the starting point for estimating the far-angle (or offset) wavelet.
No prior knowledge of the elastic parameters and density beyond the solution space defined by any hard constraints is provided at the well locations. This makes comparison of the filtered well logs and the inversion outputs at these locations a natural quality control. The lowest frequencies from the inversion are replaced with information from the geologic model since they are poorly constrained by the seismic data. When applied in global mode a spatial control term is added to the objective function and large subsets of traces are inverted simultaneously. The simultaneous inversion algorithm takes multiple angle-stacked seismic data sets and generates three elastic parameter volumes as output.
The resulting elastic parameters are real-rock properties that can be directly related to reservoir properties. The more advanced algorithms use the full Knott-Zoeppritz equations and there is full allowance for amplitude and phase variations with offset. This is done by deriving unique wavelets for each input-partial stack. The elastic parameters themselves can be directly constrained during the seismic inversion and rock-physics relationships can be applied, constraining pairs of elastic parameters to each other. Final elastic-parameter models optimally reproduce the input seismic, as this is part of the seismic inversion optimization.
Post Stack Geostatistical inversion
Geostatistical inversion integrates high resolution well data with low resolution 3-D seismic, and provides a model with high vertical detail near and away from well control. This generates reservoir models with geologically-plausible shapes, and provides a clear quantification of uncertainty to assess risk. Highly detailed petrophysical models are generated, ready for input to reservoir-flow simulation.
Geostatistics differs from statistics in that it recognizes that only certain outcomes are geologically plausible. Geostatistical inversion integrates data from many sources and creates models that have greater resolution than the original seismic, match known geological patterns, and can be used for risk assessment and reduction.
Seismic, well logs and other input data are each represented as a probability density function (PDF), which provides a geostatistical description based on histograms and variograms. Together these define the chances of a particular value at a particular location, and the expected geological scale and composition throughout the modeled area.
Unlike conventional inversion and geomodeling algorithms, geostatistical inversion takes a one-step approach, solving for impedance and discrete property types or lithofacies at the same time. Taking this approach speeds the process and improves accuracy.
Individual PDFs are merged using bayesian inference techniques, resulting in a posterior PDF conditioned to the whole data set. The algorithm determines the weighting of each data source, eliminating potential bias. The posterior PDF is then input to a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to generate realistic models of impedance and lithofacies, which are then used to co-simulate rock properties such as porosity. These processes are typically iterated until a model emerges that matches all information. Even with the best model, some uncertainty remains. Uncertainty can be estimated using random seeds to generate a range of realizations. This is especially useful when dealing with parameters that are sensitive to change; an analysis of this sort enables greater understanding of development risk.
Pre-stack log-detail inversion.
Amplitude versus offset (AVO) (AVA) geostatistical inversion incorporates simultaneous AVO (AVA) inversion into the geostatistical inversion algorithm so high resolution, geostatistics, and AVO may be attained in a single method. The output model (realizations) are consistent with well log information, AVO seismic data, and honor rock property relationships found in the wells. The algorithm also simultaneously produces elastic properties (P-impedance, S-impedance and density) and lithology volumes, instead of sequentially solving for lithology first and then populating the cell with impedance and density values. Because all output models match all input data, uncertainty can be quantitatively assessed to determine the range of reservoir possibilities within the constraining data.
AVA geostatistical inversion software uses leading-edge geostatistical techniques, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and pluri-Gaussian lithology modeling. It is thus possible to exploit "informational synergies" to retrieve details that deterministic inversion techniques blur out or omit. As a result, geoscientists are more successful in reconstructing both the overall structure and the fine details of the reservoir. The use of multiple-angle-stack seismic volumes in AVA geostatistical inversion enables further evaluation of elastic rock properties and probable lithology or seismic facies and fluid distributions with greater accuracy.
The process begins with a detailed petrophysical analysis and well log calibration. The calibration process replaces unreliable and missing sonic and density measurements with synthesized values from calibrated petrophysical and rock-physics models. Well log information is used in the inversion process to derive wavelets, supply the low frequency component not present in the seismic data, and to verify and analyze the final results. Next, horizon and log data are used to construct the stratigraphic framework for the statistical information to build the models. In this way, the log data is only used for generating statistics within similar rock types within the stratigraphic layers of the earth.
Wavelet analysis is conducted by extracting a filter from each of the seismic volumes using the well elastic (angle or offset) impedance as the desired output. The quality of the inversion result is dependent upon the extracted seismic wavelets. This requires accurate p-sonic, s-sonic and density logs tied to the appropriate events on the seismic data. Wavelets are extracted individually for each well. A final "multi-well" wavelet is then extracted for each volume using the best individual well ties and used as input to the inversion.
Histograms and variograms are generated for each stratigraphic layer and lithology, and preliminary simulations are run on small areas. The AVA geostatistical inversion is then run to generate the desired number of realizations, which match all the input data. The results are quality controlled by direct comparison of the inverted rock property volumes against the well logs. Further QC involves review by a multidisciplinary team of all input parameters and the results of the simulation. Analysis of multiple realizations produces mean (P50) property cubes or maps. Most often these are lithology or seismic facies cubes and predicted lithology or facies probabilities, but other outputs are also possible. Selected lithology and facies cubes are also generated for P15 and P85 probabilities (for example). Reservoir 3-D bodies of hydrocarbon-bearing units are captured with their corresponding rock properties, and the uncertainty in reservoir size and properties is quantified.

2009 Big 12 Championship Game

The 2009 Dr. Pepper Big 12 Championship Game was held on December 5, 2009 at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The divisional winners from the Big 12 Conference squared off in the 14th edition of the game. The Texas Longhorns represented the South Division and the Nebraska Cornhuskers represented the North Division. Texas won the contest 13-12 on a last second field goal by placekicker Hunter Lawrence.
On the play immediately prior to Lawrence's field goal, as the game clock ticked down Texas quarterback Colt McCoy rolled far to the right, with Nebraska's Ndamukong Suh in pursuit, and threw a pass well down field and out of bounds. The game clock ran out, which would have ended the fourth quarter, with Nebraska appearing to win 12-10. However, pursuant to Rule 12-3-6, the video replay official determined that an "egregious," and therefore reviewable, error concerning the game clock had occurred and ordered the errantly elapsed one second be returned to the clock. The ESPN/ABC video feed showed that McCoy's pass hit a stadium railing, out of bounds, with :01 remaining, allowing Texas to kick the winning field goal to advance to the BCS title game.
The game was the third championship tilt between the Cornhuskers and Longhorns. The unranked Longhorns upset #3 Nebraska 37-27 in the 1996 game in St. Louis, Missouri, while the #2 Cornhuskers beat #12 Texas 22-6 in 1999 in San Antonio, Texas. Texas is now 3-2 in the conference championship game; Nebraska fell to 2-3. Texas is second in Big 12 Championship titles to Oklahoma, who own 7 conference titles. 
Per Big 12 policy, Nebraska was declared the home team because the game took place in a home state of four Big 12 South teams. Designated "home" teams are 9–5 in Big 12 Championship Games. The South Division has won 6 years in a row and is 10-4 overall.
Selection process.
The Big 12 Championship Game matched up the winner of the "North" and "South" divisions of the Big 12 Conference. The game was first played in 1996, when the conference was assembled to include all of the teams from the Big Eight Conference as well as four teams that had formerly been members of the Southwest Conference. The championship game was modeled on the SEC format, which was the first conference in college football to have a conference championship game. Today, five additional conferences also now hold conference championship games: the ACC, C-USA, the MAC, the Big Ten, and the Pac-12. While the Big 12 has drop their championship game at this time because only having 10 teams and a championship game requires at least 12.

I'm Not Alone (song)

"I'm Not Alone" is a song by Scottish recording artist Calvin Harris, released as the lead single from his second studio album, "Ready for the Weekend". The track was first played by Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1 as his "essential new tune" on 23 January 2009 and has been described as a slice of euphoric dance. On 12 April 2009, the song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, earning Harris his first solo number-one single on the chart and second overall following his 2008 collaboration with Dizzee Rascal and Chrome, "Dance wiv Me".
Background and writing.
Harris said of this song: "The whole track's a light and shade thing, two styles put together. I find it quite hard to write a happy-happy lyric now, for some reason. I don't know why that is, to be honest with you. Maybe it's staying in a room for a huge amount of time on your own, and that's reflected in the lyrics!"
Chart performance.
"I'm Not Alone" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 12 April 2009 ― for the week ending 18 April 2009 ― knocking Lady Gaga's "Poker Face" off the top of the chart. It remained at the top position for two weeks, until it was dethroned by Tinchy Stryder's "Number 1" featuring N-Dubz. On 3 January 2010, "I'm Not Alone" reentered the chart at number ninety-nine. 
In the Republic of Ireland, the single debuted at number fourteen on the Irish Singles Chart on 9 April 2009, peaking at number four by its third week.
Controversy.
When Chris Brown's 2010 single "Yeah 3x" was released, comparisons by critics to Harris's 2009 single "I'm Not Alone" and a tweet by Harris himself led to controversy resulting in Brown adding Harris to the song credits, though no legal action was taken. The claims of theft caused multiple Chris Brown fans to harass Harris over Twitter. The two artists reportedly have no hard feelings toward each other since the controversy; Harris even called Brown his "best mate" and said that he enjoys listening to his work.
Music video.
The music video for "I'm Not Alone" was filmed in Oslo, Norway on 6 February 2009. It was directed by Christian Holm-Glad.
The clip begins with a small boy (potentially meant to represent a young Harris) found in thick snow wandering the woods dragging a sledge with a toy bear on top. He then sets up camp and lights a fire to keep warm whilst cuddling his toy bear. The bear is then found on the sledge again and is then dropped. The scene closes and cuts to a dungeon styled setting that showcases Harris portrayed as a Frankenstein-type character who is seen to perform experiments on numerous female captives, combining their essences to reanimate his "lost" teddy bear.

AREVA Solar's boiler is the first and only solar boiler certified with an S-Stamp by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).
The Kimberlina Solar Thermal Energy Plant was the first of its kind to be built in California in more than 20 years, with the previous plant being the Solar Energy Generating Systems, which employs solar troughs.

Lines (album)

Lines is the fifth studio album by the American pop group The Walker Brothers. The album was released in 1976 and was the second since reforming in 1975. The album failed to chart and includes the singles "Lines" and "We're All Alone", neither of which met with much success.
The album was stylistically similar to their 1975 comeback "No Regrets", matching the general musical styles of Country and Pop music and marrying them to romantic orchestral arrangements. Aside from "First Day" which is actually the work of John Maus, writing under the pseudonym A. Dayam, the album is compiled of non-original compositions. Scott Walker however would not contribute new songs until the group's following album "Nite Flights" in 1978.
Reception.
"Lines" received mixed reviews from the majority of critics.

After writing sessions in Wales and London with bass player Sion Llwyd and guitarist Ben Main, Elin travelled to New York. There, she spent time recording in Avatar Studios with Jim Steinman, and with Take That and Celine Dion producer Steve Rinkoff. Elin stated "It was an amazing experience – I learnt so much from working there". She then brought her music back to Wales, recording at Bethesda with Dave Wrench and mastering the album at Hafod near Cardiff. "Working with such an experienced team on Hafana opened my eyes to new ways of writing, even of singing" Elin explained. "And all that excitement comes across on the album."

Internationally, the show aired on E4 in the United Kingdom, Zee Café in India, Fox8 in Australia, ABC Spark in Canada, RTM2 in Malaysia, and on TV2 in New Zealand.
"Make It or Break It" was created by Holly Sorensen who, along with Paul Stupin and John Ziffren, served as the show's executive producers. The stunt doubles were former elite, Olympian or NCAA champion gymnasts.
Plot.
In the season one premiere, Payson Keeler (Ayla Kell), Kaylie Cruz (Josie Loren), and Lauren Tanner (Cassie Scerbo) are elite-level gymnasts. They train at one of the best gyms in the country, the fictional "Rocky Mountain Gymnastics Training Center" (or "The Rock") in Boulder, Colorado, in hopes of winning gold at the 2012 Olympics in London. The girls have been best friends and teammates for years. They are joined by newcomer Emily Kmetko (Chelsea Hobbs), an untrained gymnastics phenomenon plucked from obscurity. It is revealed that Emily's family is struggling for money, and she has to work at a pizza shack to keep them afloat, and receives scholarship money to do gymnastics. The Rock's Athletes compete for places on the clubs team for nationals. Emily ranks third ahead of Lauren, despite Lauren's attempt to sabotage her vault.
The girls' futures are thrown into turmoil when their head coach, Marty Walsh (Erik Palladino), is blackmailed out of his job at The Rock by Lauren's father Steve, who is angry that his daughter was beaten by Emily. Marty is forced to move to The Rock's rival gym in Denver, taking Lauren and other gymnasts with him. It is revealed later that Kaylie's mother (Rosa Blasi) and Marty were having an affair, and he left to keep the secret from being exposed. After a visit from an angry Payson (who is joined by Kaylie, Emily and her sister Becca), Marty tells Steve he is in charge from now on and will do things his way. Steve then goes in search of Sasha Belov, the only gymnast to have beaten Marty Walsh to an Olympic gold medal. Belov tells Tanner he isn't interested because Steve split up what could have been the greatest team in US history when he took Lauren to Denver. Steve and Lauren then return to the rock accompanied by Sasha.
While Payson appreciates Sasha's experience and drive, the other girls chafe at his demanding style. Kaylie and Emily decide to go to a party before Sasha's new regime is put in place. Payson agrees to got as a chaperone. At the party Emily meets Razor, a coworker from the pizza shack, and a drunk Kaylie is seen by her secret boyfriend Carter having told him she couldn't go out because her Dad wouldn't let her. Meanwhile, Lauren abandons her birthday meal with her father, after he brings his executive assistant (and girlfriend) Summer. She goes to the party and comforts Carter. The two sleep together, but it clearly doesn't mean as much to Carter as it does to Lauren. Throughout the season, Emily tries to hide the fact she has to work to support her family, fearing this news could jeopardize her scholarship. However, she is forced to confess this to the other girls while they are cleaning mats as punishment for going to the party. They help her climb out the window to get to work in time to avoid being fired. Kaylie hides her relationship with Carter Anderson, another gymnast at The Rock. Lauren is hiding the fact that she has lost her virginity to Carter from Kaylie, while trying to get him to go out with her instead and struggling to fight the feeling that Summer is trying to replace her mother or is after her father's money. Payson has back problems and tries to conceal this from her parents and Sasha because she is desperate not to lose her chance to become National Champion and beat her rival, Kelly Parker (Nicole Gale Anderson) in a pre-nationals club meet between The Denver Elite and The Rock. While Payson manages to beat Kelly, Emily attempts a more difficult dismount on bars than the one Sasha told her to do and falls. She is banned from competing at nationals and suspended from the rock. Damon, a friend of Razors who is covering his shifts at the Pizza Shack helps Emily break in to the gym at night to perfect the move and prove herself to Sasha. However, she isn't allowed back until she get over her trust issues and lets Sasha help her. Lauren warms up to Summer who convinces Steve to give Lauren her mother's contact details so she can come to watch her at nationals. Lauren goes to the bus stop but her mother Leslie never arrives. Later at nationals Summer realises that Steve threatened Leslie into not coming and their argument results in a break-up. Before nationals, Carter confesses to Kaylie that he cheated. She disappears, but Emily, Lauren and Payson find her at gymnastics camp. Lauren reveals it was her who slept with Carter, but eventually all the girls put aside their differences and return to Boulder in time to leave for nationals. Payson is favourite to win but after a fall on the uneven bars, she fractures her spine and is told she can never do gymnastics again. Kaylie receives the title of National Champion, beating Kelly Parker. Lauren places fifth and Emily places twelvth, meaning that all three receive spots on the National Team.
As season one resumes, Payson deals with what seems to be the end of her gymnastics career and dreams. Summer and Sasha begin a relationship, and Emily and Payson get closer. Payson undergoes cutting-edge surgery to fix her spine. Although the operation is successful, she does not want to return to gymnastics, fearing she will re-injure herself. Meanwhile, the three Rock girls find an enemy in the head of the National Gymnastics Committee, Ellen Beals (Michelle Clunie), who prizes obedience to her authority and feels threatened by The Rock girls' independence. Emily wrestles with her desire to be an Olympic gymnast and her love for Damon, a co-worker at The Pizza Shack where she works. Carter is allowed back in The Rock and finds support from Lauren after she learns he is living in his car, having been kicked out of the home by his father, who does not support his gymnastics career. Payson's father is laid off from his job and has to accept another one far from Boulder.
Payson's mother, Kim takes over managing The Rock, as the girls are shut out of the National Team. Kaylie and Emily are kept back from a USA vs. China meet. To get The Rock girls recognized as being international standard, The Rock holds a private meet between them and the Chinese National Team. Ellen Beals pressures Kaylie not to compete, telling her she might lose and damage her profile. Ellen also blackmails Emily, telling her if she competes she will have her scholarship revoked after Ellen finds out about Emily's job at the Pizza Shack. Working together, the girls get five medals, more than the U.S. National Team got in Beijing.
In the second season, the girls are joined at The Rock by superstar male gymnast Austin Tucker (Zane Holtz). Payson refuses to accept her body has changed since her injury and is encouraged to petition to the National Team by Ellen Beals against the advice of Sasha, who thinks she is not ready. Her petition is denied, and she is heartbroken until Sasha convinces her to return, hoping to revitalise her career by transitioning her into being an artistic gymnast. Payson, whose previous style emphasized power over grace, is skeptical but comes around and finds herself romantically attracted to Sasha. She impulsively kisses him, but he pushes her away. The Kmetko family struggles financially with the loss of Emily's scholarship, until Steve Tanner secretly organizes a private scholarship to fund her training, after beginning a relationship with Chloe. When Emily finds out where the money is coming from, she refuses to accept the charity. Chloe secretly begins work as a bartender in a strip club. Emily's brother begins to have seizures because his prescription has not been refilled. Discovering problems with their insurance and not having money to pay for the medication, Emily steals the medication and is arrested.
Lauren finds the tape of Sasha and Payson's kiss in the practice camera. In an effort to get rid of Sasha and have Summer get back with her father, she leaks the first part (showing only the kiss) to Ellen Beals and deletes the later part (showing Sasha pushing Payson away). This results in Sasha being dismissed and Steve Tanner becoming president of The Rock. Summer is behind Sasha and does not believe he would act inappropriately. Sasha and Summer break up because though Sasha respects Summer's values, he does not share them. Newly minted national champion Kaylie struggles with the demands of her position and develops an eating disorder. Her parents refuse to believe it, but Austin tries to convince Kaylie that she needs help. In the midseason finale, the girls compete at trials for the World Championships. Payson confronts the gymnastics committee, asking them to accept her as an artistic gymnast. Police arrive to take Emily away, as she has missed her court hearing. Kaylie collapses while competing and is rushed to the hospital. All four girls make the Worlds Team.
When Season Two returns, the girls cope with the loss of Sasha Belov. After breaking down, Kaylie admits to having an eating disorder and seeks treatment. Austin supports her, and they begin a relationship. Emily is forced to wear an ankle monitor due to her probation after being caught stealing. The other girls train for the World Gymnastics Competition, a task made harder by the presence of their arch enemy, Kelly Parker, at The Rock. Sasha returns after the girls track him down in Romania, and Lauren starts to like him better as he begins coaching her directly. While in recovery, Kaylie offers her mother's old recording studio to Emily's boyfriend Damon, who has been struggling to make an album in order to impress his new record label.
After Emily witnesses Kaylie and Damon singing together at the Pizza Shack, she imagines Damon is unfaithful and breaks up with him. Emily learns that she is pregnant, and Damon is the father. After members of the NGO try to persuade her to have an abortion, she insists that they have controlled her life for too long. She ignores their suggestion, and she keeps the baby. After informing Damon of the baby, she insists that being teen parents together will be perfect. Emily returns immediately to pack but is interrupted by Kaylie. Kaylie tells her that after Damon and Emily broke up, Damon kissed Kaylie. Feeling betrayed, Emily leaves to live with her godmother in Las Vegas without telling Damon. Eventually, Damon finds Emily and decides to be there for her.
Summer and Steve Tanner become engaged. A new gymnast, Max (Josh Bowman), comes to The Rock, attracting the attention of Lauren and Payson. Though Max seems more interested in Payson, she is more focused on her dream. Lauren pursues him past the point of ridiculousness. She assures Payson that Max is her new boyfriend; Max denies this. Max, Austin, and Payson help Kaylie train in secret, as they try to convince Sasha that Kaylie is ready to compete at Worlds. In the wake of Emily's departure, Kelly Parker becomes closer to Kaylie, despite the scheming of her stage mother, Sheila (Kathy Najimy). Kaylie offers her comfort as Kelly's mom is only supportive of Kelly's fame and fortune. Kelly steals Kaylie's journal and is instructed by her mother to give it to Ellen Beals. The night before Worlds, Kelly returns the journal and admits to stealing it. This causes Kaylie's new trust in Kelly to falter. Summer finds out that Lauren sent in the kiss cam video and calls off the wedding, as she wants nothing to do with Lauren or Steve Tanner. Max tells Austin he does not think he can have a relationship with Payson because he is bisexual. He goes on a drive with Lauren, and they get into a car accident. Lauren is fine, but Max breaks his collarbone. Payson wants to go pro so she can earn money to help support her family, as they are struggling with debt after Payson's medical bills and training, but her parents do not want her to forfeit her eligibility for a college scholarship. Payson tells Max she loves him and begs him to forget she said anything when his feelings are not confessed to her. In the season two finale, the four girls lead the team to the World Competition in Rio de Janeiro, where they win team gold.
When Season Three opens with Payson, Lauren, and Kaylie heading to the American Olympic Training Center as they prepare for the 2012 London Olympics. They deal with a new coach and teammates, including upcoming gymnasts. An uninvited gymnast, Jordan Randall, convinces Coach MacIntire to let her train with the group, causing tension. Coach Mac pairs up the girls, forcing Kaylie to live and work with Kelly Parker and Lauren to work with Payson. They eventually become close friends. Kelly is not good enough for the Olympics and leaves gymnastics. Payson has a new romance with Rigo (Tom Maden). Payson finds out that Lauren has an irregular heart beat, but Lauren has heart surgery. Austin does not make the Olympic Team and blames Kaylie. Jordan reveals that a former coach, Coach Keagan, molested her when she was young. Desperate to ensure her spot on the team, Wendy drugs Kaylie with a cold medicine containing a banned substance. After Austin and Kaylie reunite, then Lauren, Payson, and Jordan tell the NGO that they are boycotting Olympic tryouts unless Kaylie is allowed to perform. Lauren discovers the secret Wendy has been hiding and exposes her, getting Wendy kicked out. The series three finale culminates with the four girls, Payson, Lauren, Kaylie, plus Jordan, being chosen to represent the U.S. in the Olympics.

Château de la Napoule

The Château de la Napoule is a restored French castle, located in Mandelieu-la-Napoule in the Alpes-Maritimes Department of France, It has been classified as an historical landmark since 1993, and the gardens are listed by the French Ministry of Culture as among the Notable gardens of France. It was featured as one of the main locations in the 1999 movie "Simon Sez". 
History.
The castle was constructed in the 14th century by the Countess of Villeneuve. Over the centuries it was rebuilt several times. In the 19th century it was turned into a glass factory. In 1918, it was purchased by Americans, Henry Clews Jr. and Marie Clews (1880-1959), who restored and moved into the castle. They added additional sections in their own personal style, with sculptures by Henry Clews Jr. The castle is owned by the La Napoule Art Foundation, which was founded in 1951 by Marie Clews, and serves as a cultural centre.
After Henry's death and during the Second World War, the castle was captured by German soldiers. Marie Clews served the soldiers by acting as the maid of the castle's staff so she could stay close to her home and the memory of her husband.
The gardens.
When the Clews acquired the castle, the park had cedar and eucalyptus trees, and had been abandoned for years. Marie Clews began the restoration of the gardens. The park of the castle today has elements of a garden à la française and of an English landscape garden, with a grand alley, basins, perspectives, and views of the sea. In addition, there are three smaller gardens in the Italian style: the Garden de la Mancha next to the Tower of La Mancha, under which the mausoleum of the Clews family is located; the terraces which overlook the Bay of Cannes, which are planted with cypress trees, hedges and rosemary; and the secret garden, in a corner of the walls with windows looking at the sea, with a Venetian well in the centre.

Mining community

A mining community, also known as a mining town or a mining camp, is a community that houses miners. Mining communities are usually created around a mine or a quarry.
History.
United States.
In the United States several different types of communities were established by Americans during the frontier period; mining towns, railroad towns, cow towns and farming towns were the primary settlements built. Throughout the continental United States and Alaska, valuable minerals were discovered and mining operations launched. The miners would usually settle a site and make home of tents and shacks,that miners built by hand. Eventually mining buildings such as smelters or stamp mills would be constructed followed by cabins, stores and saloons. A community would naturally be born with the settling of women and children and existed as long as precious metal could be dug from the area.
Sometimes the geographical location of a mining community or the various American railroads would ensure a community's existence after all the valuable minerals were gone. Many American mining communities became ghost towns though others have become prominent cities. A settlement usually can only be considered a mining community if a mine exists directly at the settlement or within the immediate area and if the population relies on the mine economically. Smelter towns, built for smeltering ore extracted from mines, are considered a type of mining community.
Historic mining communities.
Germany.
In Germany, a "Bergstadt" refers to a settlement near mineral deposits vested with town privileges, "Bergregal" rights and tax exemption, in order to promote the economic development of the mining region.

France–Niger relations

France–Niger relations refer to foreign relations between France and the Niger. Their relations are based on a long shared history and the more than sixty year rule of Niger by French colonial empire beginning with the French conquest in 1898. Niger obtained independence from France in 1960, and a history of French influenced culture and French language have been a point of commonality in the creation of a distinctive Nigerien culture from the diverse pre-colonial nationalities which make up modern Niger. France benefited economically from their time as a colonial power, and still relies on imports from Niger for elements of their economy.
Colonialism and decolonisation.
Niger has maintained close ties with France, its former colonial power throughout the history of the Nigerien Republic. Following Niger's independence in 1960, France maintained several hundred advisers at all levels of Niger's government and military. In the 1960s, the Military of Niger was drawn entirely from Nigerien former members of the French Colonial Forces: officered by Frenchmen who agreed to take joint French-Nigerien citizenship. In 1960 there were only ten African officers in the Nigerien army, all of low rank. President Diori signed legislation to end the employment of expatriate military officers in 1965, some continued to serve until the 1974 coup, when all French military presence was evacuated. As well, the French had maintained until 1974 around 1000 troops of the 4th "Régiment Interarmes d'Outre-Mer" (Troupes de Marine) with bases at Niamey, Zinder, Bilma and Agadez. In 1979 a smaller French force was again based permanently in Niger.
Current economic ties.
France-Nigerien relations continue to be close, with France as Niger's top export partner (in value), and the French government being almost entirely dependent upon Niger for the Uranium which fuels its extensive Nuclear Power system, mined in the northern town of Arlit. Niger criticized France for the agreement saying that it should get a larger share of profits from uranium ore mining.
Diplomatic relations.
While conflicts have developed and subsided between the two independent republics, France maintains a strong diplomatic presence in Niamey and several thousand French expatriates live across the nation. Niger in turn maintains one of its only 24 foreign embassies in Paris along with three Honorary consular offices (in Bordeaux, Lyon, and Marseille) serving a large expatriate and naturalised Niger born population which lives in France.
Cultural ties.
Nigerian national culture, made up as it is of a diverse group of pre-colonial national cultures, has been greatly influenced by French culture. The French language continues to be the official language of the Republic of Niger. Cultural centers, such as the Centre culturel franco nigérien Jean Rouch in Niamey and the Centre culturel franco nigérien de Zinder in Zinder provide major institutions for the growth and promotion of French culture in Niger, as well as promoting Nigerien culture to a French audience. Niger is a founding member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie.

Kelly Dixon

Dr. Kelly J. Dixon is an Associate Professor of Archaeology at the University of Montana and a member of the College of Arts And Sciences at UM. Her main area of work is the American West, and she is perhaps best known for her work with the Donner Party site, as well as research into saloons in Virginia City, Nevada.
Education.
Kelly Dixon attended the University of Minnesota at Duluth, majoring in anthropology. She went on to receive her Master of Science in Industrial Archaeology at Michigan Technological University in 1995 and her Doctorate in Anthropology at the University of Nevada in Reno. While at the University of Nevada she worked on her dissertation based on the archaeology of an African American saloon with Donald Hardesty.
Research.
Dixon's particular field of interest is the historical archaeology of the American West and in other settings where cultures from various parts of the world came into contact. Between 1997 and 2002 she conducted projects in Virginia City, Nevada and the Comstock Mining District while working for the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office at the Comstock Archaeology Center. 
Dixon has also done extensive work on the Donner Party site, continuing the work done by Hardesty in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 2003, in conjunction with researchers from the University of Oregon, a production company affiliated with the Discovery Channel sponsored work there. This resulted in the show "Unsolved History: The Donner Party". Her team found numerous artifacts including ceramics, pieces of a lantern, writing slate, mirror fragments, glass from a medicine bottle, and musket balls. She returned in the summer of 2004 for five weeks to carry an excavation with her colleagues that was funded by various universities, a local foundation, and eventually, for part of the lab analysis, a production company affiliated with the History Channel. Dixon and colleagues were not just concerned with the topic of cannibalism and whether it may have occurred at the Donner Party's Alder Creek camp, but what the individuals living in that camp endured and what, in general, humans do, or how they adapt, when faced desperate circumstances. The combined historical and archaeological evidence indicated that cannibalism did take place but not until the last few weeks. The History Channel aired the thirty minute segment on the Donner Party in the spring of 2006 as part of a documentary on cannibalism.
Dixon is currently developing student-oriented multidisciplinary archaeological research at the mining ghost town of Coloma, Montana. and at isolated Chinese mining communities in Western Montana She currently serves as the editor for the Society for Historical Archaeology website.

Luiz Carlos de Carvalho Teixeira de Freitas

Luiz Carlos de Carvalho Teixeira de Freitas (born 25 December 1952, in São Paulo, Brazil), is a Brazilian journalist, psychologist and writer.
Because of his wide range of intellectual interests, he wrote about many fields of knowledge, such as Anthropology, Arcane, Distance learning, History, Psychology, Marketing and Advertising and Theology, besides a novel.
Beginning as a journalist, he was field reporter in segmented newspapers and radio broadcasting (Jovem Pan), a news editor in a TV broadcast network (TV Record) and a director for specialized magazines in marketing and advertising ("Mercado Global" magazine, edited by Globo Network Commercial Superintendence (1975), "Propaganda" and "Marketing" magazines, edited by Editora Referência (1977), and "Briefing" magazine, of his own (1978–1982)).
In 1985, he published his first book, "Por que fazer terapia?" ("Why therapy?"), written for the general public but, after only a short period of time, selected as a bibliography suggestion in many Brazilian psychology colleges.
He began research into theoretically associations upon western astrology and Junguian and transpersonal psychology, focusing on the use of birth charts as an unorthodox psychodiagnostic system, strengthening the concept of “clinical astrology” and writing and editing the books "O simbolismo astrológico e a psique humana" ("The astrologic symbols and human mind") (1988) and "Astrologia clínica, um método de autoconhecimento"[http://www.luzcom.com.br/cybook/html/capa.htm] ("Clinic astrology, a self-understanding method") (1989).
After the rise of the Internet in Brazil, he was the first Brazilian writer who commercialized an editorial cyberbook (1997), offering a complete download of "Tahuantinsuyo – O Estado Imperial Inca" ("Tahuantinsuyo – The Inca’s Imperial State")[http://www.luzcom.com.br/inca/html/homepage.htm], a complete register and analysis of the biggest pre-Columbian imperial state in South America, based on researches and six year's visits at Cusco and surroundings, in the central Peruvian region of the Andes mountain range (Cordillera).
This book nowadays is available print on demand on www.amazon.com: "Who were the inca?"
As a consequence of his transdisciplinary studies of altered states of consciousness and the possibilities of psychoemotional development through controlled practices of those expansions, in the fields of Behavioural sciences, Psychobiology and Transpersonal psychology, and as result of his first studies of ancient Christianity (from Paul to Augustine) and Comparative religion, edited "Terapia, um caminho para o divino" ("Therapy, a path to the Divine") (2000).
Those transdisciplinary studies was a part of a research program focused on what is generally called “Santo Daime’s religion”, and the product of the program was published in the "Trilogia Juramidam" ("Juramidam’s Trilogy")[http://www.juramidam.jor.br]: "O Mensageiro – o replantio daimista da doutrina cristã" ("The Messenger – daimist’s sowing of Christian doctrine") (2002), "A Rainha da floresta – uma missão daimista de evangelização" ("Forest’s Queen – a daimista mission of evangelization") (2002) and "A verdade além da doutrina – a busca daimista do rosto de Deus" ("The truth, beyond the doctrine – the daimist’s quest to see God’s face") (2008).
This research program was focused on the period that began in 1931 - the beginning of the first Christian cults with daime, or ayahuasca, a south-American regional beverage used as a controlled resource of consciousness expansion - and ended in 1971 with the death of Raimundo Irineu Serra, also known as "mestre Irineu", the Brazilian preacher who started these cults.
This strict focus permitted the keen knowledge of what was really preached by master Irineu, by the study of the specific content of the hymns adopted by him, which is the written testimony of the true identity, method and purpose of his beliefs. All the stories about his life and works were preserved only by oral tradition after he died, and the result of these researches (1993–2002) established a clear contrast with previous historical, sociological and anthropological studies made by researchers from Brazil and other countries.
Repeated academic studies, in order to study master Irineu’s works, have adopted since 1982 as his main study object a dissidence originated in 1976, five years after master Irineu’s death. And because this dissidence was syncretic since its beginning (popular catholicism, kardecism and African-based cults such as umbanda and candomblé), the researchers believed that master Irineu’s work and beliefs were also syncretic from the beginning.
Through the exegesis of the hymns adopted by master Irineu and ten years of local research, Teixeira de Freitas take for granted and give solid evidence to the genuine Christian profile in the master Irineu’s works and beliefs, through devotion to the Virgin Mary and faith centered in the Trinity. His studies also demonstrate that master Irineu’s works were not a specific religion and that the syncretic profile, studied by other researchers, was a historical transformation caused by that dissidence and the beliefs of the dissidence’s founder, Sebastião Mota de Melo.
At 2002, after was member of Organization Committee for Strategic Planning of the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo, was co-writer of the book "Estratégia – Perspectivas e Applicações" ("Strategy – Prospectives and Applications"), in the chapter “Nova abordagem organizacional para as necessidades estratégicas contemporâneas” (New organizational approach for contemporary strategic needs), edited by Sociedade Latino-americana de Estratégia (Latin-American Society for Strategy).
In 2005, in a special ceremony held in the National Congress of Brazil, in celebration of the 90th anniversary of the oldest Brazilian private foundation of health assistance and well-being promotion ("Fundação Amaral Carvalho"[http://www.amaralcarvalho.org.br], or Amaral Carvalho Foundation), founded in 1915 at the Brazilian city of Jaú by his maternal ancestors Domingos Pereira de Carvalho and Anna Marcelina Campanhã de Carvalho, he presented the book Café, Carvalho e Caridade ("Coffee, Carvalho and charity"), telling the story of his family and the Foundation into the history of the city of Jaú, the state of São Paulo, Brazil and the world.
This book was followed by "Repassando dádivas" ("Sharing gifts") (2006), a study of the loving care work of the biggest Brazilian net of volunteer women in the assistance of poor cancer patients, managed by the Fundação Amaral Carvalho in more than 400 Brazilian cities.
In 2008, he edited his first romance, named "Violeta"("Violet"), a Brazilian psychological novel, adopting for this launch an innovative method in Brazil: selling only online (at an Internet bookshop [http://www.editorabarauna.com.br), each book is printed on demand, offering high graphic quality and reduced prices, by eliminating the commercial margins of distributors and conventional bookshops.

Lake Holiday, Indiana

Lake Holiday is an unincorporated, private community on the banks of its eponymous body of water, notable for its dam, size, and its scenic beauty [http://www.goingoutside.com/lake/103/1033937_Lake_Holiday_Indiana.html]. Lake Holiday is in Montgomery County, Indiana, and it contains several parks as well as these subdivisions: Holiday Shores, Royal Hills, Imperial Woods, Wellington Villa, Cambridge Shores, Indian Hills, Sherwood Forest, and Seneca Hills. With more than 360 houses, Lake Holiday is larger than several incorporated towns in Montgomery County.
History.
Many of the older houses in the community were built in the early 1960s, as was the dam that created Lake Holiday. In March 1993, the Montgomery County Circuit Court approved a district plan that reorganized the governance of the community into two major bodies: The Lake Holiday Conservancy District, which owns and is responsible for the lake, dam, boat ramps, parks, clubhouse, and maintenance building. The other governing organization, the Lake Holiday Property Owners Association, maintains the roads and is responsible for housing and lot developments. It is a tax-exempt entity. [http://www.lake-holiday.net/LH/GOVERNING_ORGANIZATIONS.pdf
According to its website, the Lake Holiday area now "covers 750 acres, has 780 property owners, 369 homes, and 1,296 privately owned lots. The lake itself covers 150 acres and has an average depth of 18 feet with depths up to 60 feet near the dam. There are many miles of shoreline along the lake and approximately 16 miles of roadway." [http://www.lake-holiday.net/]
The clubhouse hosts community breakfasts, regular card-playing events of a social nature, Easter Egg hunts, and other seasonal activities. There is a crappie fishing tournament on the lake each May. [http://www.lake-holiday.net/news.html
Location.
Lake Holiday can be found five miles (8 km) southwest of Crawfordsville, off Indiana State Road 47, between County Roads 400 W & 550 S., near New Market. [http://www.ingenweb.org/inmontgomery/twsp/index.html] 
Its offices are located in the lake's clubhouse at 5000 South 400 West, Crawfordsville.
The lake, community, and its various subdivisions are located in Union Township, Montgomery County, Indiana, in the South Montgomery County school district. It should not be confused with the campground of the same name. [http://www.lakeholidaycamp.com/

Ukkusissat Heliport

Ukkusissat Heliport is a heliport in Ukkusissat, a village in the Uummannaq Fjord system in the Qaasuitsup municipality in northwestern Greenland. The heliport is considered a "helistop", and is served by Air Greenland as part of a government contract. There are no facilities at the helistop; check-in is administered in the Pilersuisoq communal store, the central point of the settlement.
On the way from Uummannaq Heliport, Air Greenland helicopters fly alongside the southern and western wall of Appat Island, to then pass above the narrow Appat Ikerat strait between Appat and the smaller Salleq Island, a high, standalone flooded mountain.
Airlines and destinations.
Air Greenland operates government contract flights to villages in the Uummannaq Fjord area. These mostly cargo flights are not featured in the timetable, although they can be pre-booked. Departure times for these flights as specifed during booking are by definition approximate, with the settlement service optimized on the fly depending on local demand for a given day.

Pickin' Up the Pieces (song)

"Pickin' Up the Pieces" is the first song recorded by pioneer country rock band Poco. Written by founding member Richie Furay, the song was the title track of Poco's first album.
History.
After Buffalo Springfield broke up, members Richie Furay and Jim Messina decided to make a band with pedal steel guitar player Rusty Young, with whom they had recorded the Furay-penned Springfield song "Kind Woman". This was Furay's first Poco-intended song. According to Young, "Richie played 'Pickin' Up The Pieces' for us back in 1967. ... It was obviously a comment on leaving one thing behind and carrying on," referring to the breakup of Buffalo Springfield and the new beginnings with Poco.
Attitude and Impact.
The single, though not commercially successful, was nonetheless undoubtedly instrumental in the creation of the then new genre country rock. Richie Furay said of "Pickin' Up the Pieces": "To me it summarized the attitude we wanted to convey in our music: good, wholesome & positive. There was so much negativity going on in the world in the early 70s and it needed a refreshing sound. The country rock sound we were creating, would be it. We were innovators, pioneering the way for a whole new 'Southern California sound' that many groups who followed would capitalize on."

Cliff Raven

Cliff Raven Ingram (August 24, 1932 – November 28, 2001) was one of a handful of tattoo artists (along with Sailor Jerry Collins and Don Ed Hardy) who pioneered the adoption of the Japanese tattoo aesthetic in the U.S. Born in Indiana as "Clifford H. Ingram," Cliff later shortened his first name and adopted his business name of "Raven" as his legal middle name, largely to facilitate mail delivery.
After attending Indiana University and receiving a BA in Fine Arts, Cliff took on part-time contract work in print and graphic arts for Chicago’s Spiegel retail stores amongst other projects. Cliff gave himself his first tattoo and later received tattoos from the legendary Phil Sparrow and soon found himself immersed in the tattoo subculture. After some part time work as a tattoo artist in an arcade Cliff went on to open the Cliff Raven Tattoo Studio which is now known as Chicago Tattoo and Piercing Company [http://chicagotattoo.com/home.html]. Cliff also founded Chicago Tattoo Supply and ran it out of his shop. To this day Chicago Tattoo and Piercing Company is the oldest continuously running Tattoo Studio in Chicago and has some of Cliff’s original flash still hanging on the walls.
After winning the Tattoo Artist of the Year award from the First Annual International Tattoo Convention in February 1976, Cliff and his partner Buddy Mac McFall,and partner Dale Grande bought out Lyle Tuttle’s Sunset Strip Tattoo Shop [http://www.sunsetstriptattoo.com/] in California as Cliff was looking to expand his work in the area of full body Japanese aesthetic Tattooing. Cliff subsequently swapped his interest in the Chicago operations for a full ownership of the West coast operations. He and a partner quickly established Tattoo Works—two sister studios, with one in Los Angeles (Cliff Raven Studios, now known as Sunset Strip Tattoo) which was, for years, located on the edge of West Hollywood on the famed Sunset Strip, and one in San Francisco (now defunct). While in Hollywood, Cliff had various Hollywood clientele, and he tattooed iconic celebrities such as Cher, Ringo Starr and many others. The Cliff Raven Studio was one of only six studios featured in the 1982 publication "The Rock Star Tattoo Encyclopedia," by Patricia Steur, who stated, "In other words - this is one of THE places throughout the world where it's worth going to get a tattoo." 
Throughout his career, Cliff mentored other prominent tattoo artists such as Pat Fish, Larry "Bone$" Haddick, Robert Benedetti, Robert"Mad Dog" Roberts and Greg James, amongst others. Cliff was unusual in that he was an openly gay man in a profession that, at the time, was strongly homophobic.
In 1985, Cliff semi-retired from tattooing and moved to 29 Palms, California. There he wrote editorial cartoons for the Hi-Desert Star and ran a used/rare bookstore, Raven's Books, until his death in 2001. While retired, he infrequently continued to tattoo a select group of long-term clients who sought him out although he was largely withdrawn from the world of tattooing. 
His legacy lives on at The Chicago Tattoo Co., 1017 w. Belmont Avenue in Chicago, one block west of the original location.

Peppermint Trolley Company

The Peppermint Trolley Company was an American band of the sunshine pop genre, best known for their single "Baby You Come Rollin' Across My Mind" as well as their performances on "Mannix", "The Beverly Hillbillies" and their arrangement and performance of "The Brady Bunch" original theme song.
Peppermint Trolley Company released one album and five singles on the Acta label, (a subsidiary of Dot Records). The original line-up included Jimmy Faragher (vocals, bass, guitar), Danny Faragher (vocals, keyboards), Casey Cunningham (drums) and Patrick McClure (guitar, vocals). In 1969, Jimmy and Danny Faragher, Cunningham and Tornquist left their recording contract with Acta to form the rock/soul group, Bones.
History.
The Peppermint Trolley Company was formed in Redlands, California in 1966, when the band the Mark V, consisting of members Danny Faragher, Jimmy Faragher, Steve Hauser, Dave Kelliher, Brad Madson and Dick Owens, teamed up with producer Dan Dalton, who urged the band to change its name. The Peppermint Trolley Company's name was originally proposed by Jimmy Faragher and chosen by a committee of the Mark V band members. The single "Lollipop Train" was released (with B-side "Bored to Tears") on Valiant Records.
In January 1967 the band broke up, leaving brothers Danny and Jimmy Faragher as the sole members. Recording continued and a deal was signed with Acta Records. The single "She's the Kind of Girl" was released in the spring of 1967. Casey Cunningham (drums) joined the band that June. The single "It's a Lazy Summer Day" was released the same month. Patrick McClure (guitar) joined shortly thereafter.
In the fall of 1967, Patrick McClure left the band and was replaced by Greg Tornquist (guitar). In November, recording began for "Baby You Come Rollin' Across My Mind", which was subsequently released in January 1968 and peaked on the charts at #59 that summer.
The single "Trust", written by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols, was released in September 1968, and the self-titled album "The Peppermint Trolley Company" was released that same month. While the album failed to chart, according to the liner notes of the 2009 reissue, "it sold well in many markets and can be easily found 40 years later, implying good distribution and multiple pressings."
In January 1969, The Peppermint Trolley Company left Acta Records and changed its name to Bones, going on to record two albums for Signpost Records and MCA.
Television Appearances.
The Peppermint Trolley Company made many notable television appearances, including "Mannix", "The Beverly Hillbillies", "Happening '68" and "Upbeat".
The Brady Bunch Theme.
The Peppermint Trolley Company is credited with arranging and singing "The Brady Bunch" theme song for the show's pilot. After the band left Acta Records, the vocals were rerecorded and sung by studio singers Paul Parish, John Beland and Lois Fletcher, leaving the original music intact.
2009 Reissue.
In 2009, the Peppermint Trolley Company's self-titled album was re-released on Now Sounds, a division of Cherry Red. Produced for reissue by Steve Stanley, "Beautiful Sun" contained all 11 of the original album's tracks as well as 16 bonus tracks, including many B-sides and singles from The Mark V.

<doc id="21495928" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21495928" title="Edward Walsingham">
Edward Walsingham

Edward Walsingham (died 1668) was an English royalist author, known for his verse of the First English Civil War and "Arcana Aulica", often wrongly attributed to Sir Francis Walsingham.
Life.
According to Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, Walsingham was related to the Earl of Bristol. In the preface to the "Arcana Aulica" Walsingham is described in 1652 as one who, "though very young, in a little time grew up, under the wings and favour of the Lord Digby, to such credit with the late king that he came to be admitted to his greatest trusts, and was prevented only by the fall of the court itself from climbing there into an eminenter height." He became secretary to Lord Digby soon after the outbreak of the civil war, possibly in September 1643, when Digby himself was appointed one of the principal secretaries of state after the death of Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. On 31 October Digby was made high steward of Oxford University, and through his influence Walsingham was created M.A.
While the court was at Oxford, Walsingham lodged in Magdalen College, Oxford and began writing. Walsingham conducted much of the correspondence in Digby's various intrigues, and during the latter's absence from Oxford was in constant communication with him. More than once important letters from Walsingham were intercepted by parliament and published.
He was at Oxford as late as 1645, but probably before its surrender in June 1646 he escaped to Henrietta Maria's court in France. There, perhaps under the persuasions of Sir Kenelm Digby, he became a Roman Catholic convert. In 1648 Digby was reported to have discarded him, and in the same year he was sent to Ireland; his object seems to have been either to induce the Duke of Ormonde to grant freedom of worship and other Roman Catholic claims, or to secure them by negotiating an understanding between the Catholics and the Independents. Sir Edward Nicholas felt he was unable to keep his missions secret. He was brushed off by Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara.
Walsingham returned to Paris. In 1652, he was involved in a Catholic intrigue to remove Hyde from Charles II's service, but for some reason he revealed the scheme. In 1654 Walter Montagu made him a companion to Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester; but later was excluded from his company. In 1659, he was at Brussels. At the Restoration, he remained in France, acting as secretary to Walter Montagu, who was abbot of St. Martin's, near Pontoise. In 1660 he was ordained priest and named curé of Aronville, near Pontoise. Accompanying Montagu, to England in the autumn of 1668, he died there suddenly on 9 October of that year.
Works.
He wrote several elegiac works for dead royalist commanders. In 1644 he published "Britannicae Virtutis Imago, or the Effigies of True Fortitude expressed ... in the ... actions of ... Major-general Smith," on Sir John Smith, knighted at the Battle of Edgehill. This was followed in 1645 by "Alter Britanniae Heros, or the Life of ... Sir Henry Gage". Another work left in manuscript was "Hector Britannicus", on Sir John Digby (1605–1645), brother to Sir Kenelm Digby. These works have been described as hagiography, with the subjects having in common Catholicism, culture and a noble background and character.
In 1651 he sent as a present to Ormonde his "Arcana Aulica, or Walsingham's Manual of Prudential Maxims for the Statesman and the Courtier." This work has been generally attributed to Sir Francis Walsingham, and other conjectures have been made as to its authorship. Its original was an anonymous French work, "Traité de la Cour, ou Instruction des Courtisans," by Eustache du Refuge, a diplomat and author in the reign of Henry IV of France. The first edition was published in Holland, the second at Paris, but the earliest known to be extant is the third, which appears in two parts at Paris (1619, 8vo: other editions 1622, 1631, and Leyden, 1649). It was reprinted as "Le Nouveau Traité de la Cour" in 1664 and 1672, and as "Le Conseiller d'Estat" in 1685. An English translation by John Reynolds, with a dedication to Prince Charles, was published in London in 1622. A Latin translation of the second part only, by Joachimus Pastorius, who was ignorant of its authorship, was published as "Aulicus Inculpatus" at Amsterdam (Elzevir) in 1644; and this version was reissued by Elzevir in 1649. Walsingham's translation was made from a French manuscript copy, but he also was ignorant of Du Refuge's authorship and of Reynolds's translation, and his version comprises only the second part of the "Traité." Several additions were made, e.g. the allusions (p. 37) to Richelieu. In the printer's address it is said to have been "captured in an Irish pirate" on its way to Ormonde. It was printed at London by James Young in 1652, 4to; a second edition appeared in 1655, and was reprinted in 1810, 12mo. In 1694 it was issued with Sir Robert Naunton's "Fragmenta Regalia" in 1722 an edition was published substituting "Instructions for Youth" for the first part of the title, and giving different renderings of various passages from classical authors (reprinted 1728).

Ten Hills, Somerville, Massachusetts

Ten Hills is a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the city of Somerville, Massachusetts. The area is roughly wedge-shaped, about in size, and is bounded by the Mystic River to the north, McGrath Highway to the east, and is largely separated from the rest of Somerville by Interstate 93 to the southwest. Ten Hills is neighbored by Assembly Square to the east, and Winter Hill to the southwest.
The neighborhood landscape is predominated by a single hill (not ten, as the name suggests), the peak of which is roughly at the intersection of Temple and Putnam Roads.
The Ten Hills neighborhood is located in Ward 4, Precinct 1 of the City of Somerville, which is in the 34th district of Middlesex County.
History.
Ten Hills is named after Ten Hills Farm, owned by Massachusetts' first governor, John Winthrop. This estate of was granted to Governor Winthrop by the Massachusetts Bay Colony on September 6, 1631. The farm was located along the southern bank of the Mystic River in portions of what are now the cities of Somerville and Medford. 
The farm was named by Governor Winthrop for the ten small knolls located on the property, which included orchards and meadows for grazing cattle.
In 1649, the Ten Hills Farm was inherited by Gov. Winthrop's son, John the Younger, governor of Connecticut. 
In 1677, the farm was deeded to Elizabeth Lidgett, widow of Peter Lidgett. 
In 1731, the Lidgetts deeded of the property, most of which is located in the current city of Medford, to Sir Isaac Royall, an Antiguan slave trader. Royall remodelled a brick house on that property, originally built by Governor Winthrop in 1692. Royall's son, Isaac Royall, Jr., took possession of that property in 1739, and greatly expanded it. It still stands today and is known as the Isaac Royall House.
In 1740, the remaining of the Lidgett's property, located in Somerville, was sold to Captain Robert Temple, who owned that land through the Revolutionary War. Captain Temple built a luxurious mansion at Ten Hills Farm, overlooking the river, which lasted until it was torn down in 1877.
On September 1, 1774, General Thomas Gage ordered an expedition of 200 British troops up the Mystic River to remove provincial munitions. The British landed at Ten Hills Farm, and then proceeded to Powder House Square and took 250 barrels of gunpowder to Boston. The action sparked what became known as the Powder Alarm, in which thousands of colonists, believing an attack had been made, marched on Boston and Cambridge.
In 1832 Colonel Samuel Jaques, a well known horticulturalist and breeder of livestock bought Ten Hills Farm and made it famous as a stock farm.
In 1877, the farm was destroyed and much of the high ground was used to fill in surrounding marshlands.
In 1900, the Metropolitan Park Commission acquired land along the Mystic River in Ten Hills and built Melrose Street, now called Shore Drive. In 1908, the City of Somerville built a public bath house on Melrose Street which became a very popular spot for bathers in the Mystic River. A planned amusement park was never built, but a new bathhouse along the shore of the river was built sometime between 1925 and 1947.
In 1928, the City of Somerville bought the site for the purposes of building an elementary school, and in 1930, The Charles A. Grimmons Elementary School was opened for students.
In 1980, the Grimmons School was closed due to lack of enrollment. A portion of the land was retained for the construction of Grimmons Park.
Recreation.
The Blessings of the Bay Boathouse, named after the ship built by Governor Winthrop in 1631 is located on the Mystic River Reservation at 32 Shore Drive. The boathouse is currently owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and is leased to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Middlesex County. During the summer, canoes and paddleboats can be rented by the public for use on the Mystic River.
The Blessings of the Bay Boathouse is also home to the Gentle Giant Rowing Club. The Club is a not-for-profit, registered 501(c)3, organization dedicated to introducing and nurturing the sport of rowing, regardless of age, culture, financial ability or physical capability; and to improving and preserving the environment in and surrounding the rivers we row. Gentle Giant Rowing supports the rowing program for Somerville High School which also rows out of the Blessings Boathouse.
Grimmons Park is a small playground on Gov. Winthrop Road, which opened in 1984 on the site of the former Grimmons Elementary School. The park underwent a major renovation in 2009, partially funded by a $1,000,000 grant from IKEA for improvement of parks throughout the city of Somerville (IKEA has been making plans to open a store in nearby Assembly Square).

Zamzam Well

The Well of Zamzam (or the Zamzam Well, or just Zamzam; ) is a well located within the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, east of the Kaaba, the holiest place in Islam. According to Islamic belief, it is a miraculously-generated source of water from God, which began thousands of years ago when Abraham's (Ibrāhīm) infant son Ishmael (ʼIsmāʻīl) was thirsty and kept crying for water. Millions of pilgrims visit the well each year while performing the "Hajj" or "Umrah" pilgrimages, in order to drink its water.
Traditional origin of the Zamzam Well.
Islamic history states that the Zamzam Well was revealed to Hagar (Hājar), the second wife of Abraham and mother of Ishmael. By the instruction of God, Abraham left his wife and son at a spot in the desert and walked away. She was desperately seeking water for her infant son, but she could not find any, as Mecca is located in a hot dry valley with few sources of water. Hagar ran seven times back and forth in the scorching heat between the two hills of Safa and Marwah, looking for water. Getting thirstier by the second, the infant Ishmael scraped the land with his feet, where suddenly water sprang out. There are other versions of the story involving God sending his angel, Gabriel (Jibra'il), who kicked the ground with his heel and the water rose.
The name of the well comes from the phrase "Zomë Zomë", meaning 'stop', which, according to legend, was a command repeated by Hagar during her attempt to contain the spring water.
According to Islamic tradition, Abraham rebuilt the "Bait-ul-lah" ("House of God", cognate of the Hebrew-derived place name Bethel) near the site of the well, a building which had been originally constructed by Adam (Adem), and today is called the Kaaba, a building toward which Muslims around the world face in prayer, five times each day. The Zamzam Well is located approximately east of the Kaaba.
History.
According to "IslamOnline", the well originally had two cisterns in the first era, one for drinking and one for ablution. At that time, it was a simple well surrounded by a fence of stones. Then in the era of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mansur 771 AD (154/155 AH) a dome was built above the well, and it was tiled with marble. In 775 AD (158/159 AH), Al-Mahdi rebuilt the well during his caliphate, and built a dome of teak which was covered with mosaic. One small dome covered the well, and a larger dome covered the room for the pilgrims. In 835 AD (220 AH) there was further restoration, and the dome was covered with marble during the caliphate of Al-Mu'tasim.
In 1417 (819/820 AH), during the time of the Mamluks, the mosque was damaged by fire, and required restoration. Further restoration occurred in 1430 (833/834 AH), and again in 1499 (904/95 AH) during the time of Sultan Qaitbay, when the marble was replaced.
In modern times, the most extensive restoration took place to the dome during the era of the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1915 (1333/1334 AH). To facilitate crowd control, the building housing the Zamzam was moved away from its original location, to get it out of the way of the "Tawaf", when millions of pilgrims would circumambulate the Kaaba. The water of the well is now pumped to the eastern part of the mosque, where it was made available in separate locations for men and women.
Technical information.
The Zamzam well was excavated by hand, and is about deep and in diameter. It taps groundwater from the wadi alluvium and some from the bedrock. Originally water from the well was drawn via ropes and buckets, but today the well itself is in a basement room where it can be seen behind glass panels (visitors are not allowed to enter). Electric pumps draw the water, which is available throughout the Masjid al-Haram via water fountains and dispensing containers near the Tawaf area.
Hydrogeologically, the well is in the "Wadi Ibrahim" (Valley of Abraham). The upper half of the well is in the sandy alluvium of the valley, lined with stone masonry except for the top metre (3 ft) which has a concrete "collar". The lower half is in the bedrock. Between the alluvium and the bedrock is a section of permeable weathered rock, lined with stone, and it is this section that provides the main water entry into the well. Water in the well comes from absorbed rainfall in the Wadi Ibrahim, as well as run-off from the local hills. Since the area has become more and more settled, water from absorbed rainfall on the Wadi Ibrahim has decreased.
The Saudi Geological Survey has a "Zamzam Studies and Research Centre" which analyses the technical properties of the well in detail. Water levels were monitored by hydrograph, which in more recent times has changed to a digital monitoring system that tracks the water level, electric conductivity, pH, Eh, and temperature. All of this information is made continuously available via the Internet. Other wells throughout the valley have also been established, some with digital recorders, to monitor the response of the local aquifer system.
The water level is below the surface. A pumping test at for more than a 24-hour period showed a drop in water level to below the surface and then to , after which the water level stopped receding. When pumping stopped, the water level recovered to below surface only 11 minutes later . This data shows that the aquifer feeding the well seems to recharge from rock fractures in neighbouring mountains around Mecca.
Zamzam water has no colour or smell, but it has a distinct taste, and its pH is 7.9–8.0, indicating that it is alkaline to some extent and is similar to seawater.
Possible health risks and sale.
In May 2011, a BBC London investigation found that water marketed as having been taken from the Zamzam Well contained high levels of nitrate, potentially harmful bacteria, and arsenic at levels three times the legal limit in the UK. Arsenic is a carcinogen, raising concerns that Muslims who regularly consume commercial Zamzam water in large quantities may be exposed to higher risks of cancer. The British Food Standards Agency has in the past issued warnings about water claiming to be from the Zamzam Well containing dangerous levels of arsenic; such sales have also been reported in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where it is illegal to sell Zamzam. The Saudi government has prohibited the commercial export of Zamzam water from the kingdom. However, there is a strong commercial demand for Zamzam which has resulted in continued commercial distribution of water alleged to be Zamzam.
Later in that month the Council of British Hajjis stated that drinking Zamzam water was safe and disagreed with the BBC report. They also went on to point out that the Government of Saudi Arabia does not allow the export of Zamzam water for resale. Also stating that it was unknown if the water being sold in the UK was genuine, people should not buy it and report the sellers to the Trading Standards.
The BBC's findings have drawn mixed reactions from the Muslim community. Environmental health officer Dr Yunes Ramadan Teinaz told the British broadcaster about commercially marketed Zamzam water that, "People see this water as a holy water. They find it difficult to accept that it is contaminated, but the authorities in Saudi Arabia or in the U.K. must take action." The Saudi authorities have stated that water from the well was tested by the Group Laboratories of CARSO-LSEHL in Lyon, licensed by the French Ministry of Health for the testing of drinking water. According to reports of these results, the level of arsenic in Zamzam water taken at its source is much lower than the maximum amount permitted by the World Health Organization. The Saudi authorities have thus said that the water is fit for human consumption. Zuhair Nawab, president of the Saudi Geological Survey (SGS), has claimed that the Zamzam Well is tested on a daily basis, in a process involving the taking of three samples from the well. These are said to be examined in the King Abdullah Zamzam Water Distribution Center in Mecca, which is equipped with advanced facilities.

Sperm donation

Sperm donation is the provision (or ‘donation’) by a man (known as a sperm donor) of his sperm (known as donor sperm) principally for the purpose of inseminating or impregnating a woman who is not necessarily his sexual partner. Sperm may be donated privately and directly to the intended recipient, or through a sperm bank or fertility clinic. The woman may be inseminated naturally (i.e., by sexual intercourse) or by artificial insemination. The primary recipients of donor sperm are heterosexual couples suffering from male infertility, lesbian couples and single women.
When going through a sperm bank, the recipient may select donor sperm on the basis of the donor's characteristics, such as looks, personality, academic ability, race, and many other factors. Sperm banks or clinics are subject to varying state regulations, including restrictions on donor anonymity and number of offspring that may be produced, and there may be other legal protections of the rights and responsibilities of both recipient and donor. Some sperm banks, either by choice or regulation, limit the amount of information available to potential recipients; a desire to obtain more information on donors is one reason why recipients may choose to use a known donor and/or private donation.
While a sperm donor is regarded as the natural or biological father of every child produced as a result of his donation, he is generally not intended to be the legal or "de jure" father. Depending on the jurisdiction and its laws, he may or may not later be eligible to seek parental rights or be held responsible for parental obligations.
The general process of sperm donation is described as third party reproduction. Pregnancies are usually achieved using donor sperm by assisted reproductive technology (ART). Techniques include artificial insemination (either by intracervical insemination (ISI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) in a clinic, or intravaginal insemination at home) and less commonly in vitro fertilization (IVF). Insemination may also be achieved by a donor having sexual intercourse with a woman for the sole purpose of initiating conception. This method is known as natural insemination.
Laws.
Laws regulating sperm donation address issues such as permissible reimbursement or payment, rights and responsibilities of the donor towards his biological offspring, the child's right to know his/her father's identity, and procedural issues.
Laws vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In general, laws are more likely to disregard the sperm donor's biological link to the child, so that he will neither have child support obligations nor rights to the child, when sperm donation happens in a clinical setting and/or under medical supervision. Absent specific legal protection, courts may order the sperm donor to pay child support or recognize his parental rights.
Uses.
Donor sperm may be prepared for use by artificial insemination in intrauterine insemination (IUI) or intra-cervical insemination (ICI), or, less commonly, it may be prepared for use in other assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF and ICSI. Donor sperm may also be used in surrogacy arrangements either by artificially inseminating the surrogate (known as traditional surrogacy) or by implanting in a surrogate embryos which have been created by using donor sperm together with eggs from a donor or from the 'commissioning woman' (known as gestational surrogacy). Spare embryos from this process may be donated to other women or surrogates. Donor sperm may also be used for producing embryos with donor eggs which are then donated to a woman who is not genetically related to the child she produces.
In medical terms, using donor sperm to achieve a pregnancy in IVF or ICSI is no different from using sperm from a woman's partner.
Procedures of any kind e.g. artificial insemination or IVF, using donor sperm to impregnate a woman who is not the partner of, nor related to the man who provided the sperm, may be referred to as 'donor treatments'.
A Swedish study came to the result that 94% of potential donors would be willing to donate to single women and 85% would be willing to donate to lesbian single women or lesbian couples. A review of two studies came to the result that 50 to 68% of actual donors would donate for lesbian couples, and 40 to 64% would donate to single women.
Provision.
A sperm donor may donate sperm privately or through a sperm bank, sperm agency, or other brokerage arrangement. Private donors most commonly choose artificial insemination, while natural insemination is also an option.
Generally, a man who provides sperm as a sperm donor gives up all legal and other rights over the biological children produced from his sperm. However, in private arrangements, some degree of co-parenting may be agreed upon, and the enforceability of those agreements varies by jurisdiction.
Donors may or may not be paid for the donation, according to local laws and agreed arrangements. Even in unpaid arrangements, expenses are often reimbursed.
Depending on local law and on private arrangements, men may donate anonymously or agree to provide identifying information to their offspring in the future. Private donations facilitated by an agency often use a "directed" donor, when a man directs that his sperm is to be used by a specific person. Non-anonymous donors are also called "known donors", "open donors" or "identity disclosure donors".
A review of surveys among donors came to the results that the media and advertising are most efficient in attracting donors, and that the internet is becoming increasingly important in this purpose. Recruitment via couples with infertility problems in the social environment of the sperm donor does not seem to be important in recruitment overall.
Sperm banks.
A sperm donor will usually donate sperm to a sperm bank under a contract, which would typically specify the period during which the donor will be required to produce sperm, which generally ranges from 6–24 months depending on the number of pregnancies which the sperm bank intends to produce from the donor. However, not all donors complete the intended programme of donations. If a sperm bank has access to world markets e.g. by direct sales, or sales to clinics outside their own jurisdiction, a man may donate for a longer period than two years, as the risk of consanguinity is reduced (although local laws vary widely).
The contract may also specify the place and hours for donation, a requirement to notify the sperm bank in the case of acquiring a sexual infection, and the requirement not to have intercourse or to masturbate for a period of usually 2–3 days before making a donation.
A sperm donate must generally meet specific requirements regarding age and medical history. In the United States, sperm banks are regulated as Human Cell and Tissue or Cell and Tissue Bank Product (HCT/Ps) establishments by the Food and Drug Administration. Many states also have regulations in addition to those imposed by the FDA. In the European Union a sperm bank must have a license according to the EU Tissue Directive. In the United Kingdom, sperm banks are regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.
Sperm agencies.
In some jurisdictions, sperm may also be donated through an agency rather than through a sperm bank. The agency may recruit sperm donors, usually via the Internet, and it also advertises its services on the Internet. Donors may undergo the same kind of checks and tests required by a sperm bank, although clinics and agencies are not necessarily subject to the same regulatory regimes. In the case of an agency, the sperm will be supplied to the recipient woman fresh rather than frozen.
A woman chooses a donor and notifies the agency when she requires donations. The agency notifies the donor who must supply his sperm on the appropriate days nominated by the recipient women. The agency will usually provide the sperm donor with a male collection kit usually including a collection condom and a container for shipping the sperm. This is collected and delivered by courier and the woman uses the donor's sperm to inseminate herself, typically without medical supervision. The whole process preserves the anonymity of the parties and it enables a donor to produce sperm in the privacy of his own home. A donor will generally produce samples once or twice during a recipient's fertile period, but a second sample each time may not have the same fecundity of the first sample because it is produced too soon after the first one. Pregnancy rates by this method of sperm donation vary more than those achieved by sperm banks or fertility clinics. Transit times may vary and these have a significant effect on sperm viability so that if a donor is not located near to a recipient woman the sperm may deteriorate. However, the use of fresh, as opposed to frozen semen will mean that a sample has a greater fecundity and this can produce higher pregnancy rates.
Sperm agencies may impose limits on the number of pregnancies achieved from each donor but in practice this is more difficult to achieve than for sperm banks where the whole process may be more regulated. Most sperm donors only donate for a limited period, however, and since sperm supplied by a sperm agency is not processed into a number of different vials, there is a practical limit on the number of pregnancies which are usually produced in this way. A sperm agency will, for the same reason, be less likely than a sperm bank to enable a woman to have subsequent children by the same donor.
Sperm agencies are largely unregulated and, because the sperm is not quarantined, it may carry sexually transmitted diseases. This lack of regulation has led to the competent authorities in some jurisdictions bringing legal action against sperm agencies in certain cases. Agencies typically insist on STI testing for donors, but such tests cannot detect recently acquired infections. Donors providing sperm in this way may not be protected by laws which apply to donations through a sperm bank or fertility clinic and will, if traced, be regarded as the legal father of each child produced by their sperm, (but see below, Private donors).
Private or "directed" donors.
Some donors and recipients arrange sperm donations privately and directly. Recipients may approach a friend, or may obtain a "private" or "directed" donor by advertising. A number of web sites seek to link such donors and recipients, while advertisements in gay and lesbian publications are common. Although artificial insemination is usually used, the parties may sometimes agree to natural inseminate. Where a private or directed donor is used, sperm need not be frozen. Such donors may already know the recipients, or if arranged through a broker, may meet the recipients and may become known to the recipient. Some brokers facilitate contact that maintains semi-anonymous identities for legal reasons.
Private donations may be free of charge - avoiding the significant costs of a more medicalised insemination - and fresh rather than frozen semen is generally deemed to increase the chances of pregnancy. However, they also carry the higher risks associated with any unscreened sexual or body fluid contact. Legal treatment of donors varies across jurisdictions, and in most jurisdictions, e.g. Sweden, personal and directed donors lack legal safeguards that may be available to anonymous donors. However, the laws of some nations (e.g. New Zealand) recognize written agreements between donors and recipients in a similar way to institutional donations.
Natural insemination.
Where a sperm donor inseminates a woman through sexual intercourse with her for the sole reason of enabling the woman to achieve a pregnancy, this is known as natural insemination or "NI".
Natural insemination avoids the need for medical procedures that may or may not involve the intervention of third parties. It may lack some of the safety precautions and screenings usually built into the artificial insemination process but proponents claim that it produces higher pregnancy rates.
Natural insemination is generally only carried out at the woman's fertile time, as with other methods of insemination, in order to achieve the best chances of a pregnancy.
Some private sperm donors now offer NI as an alternative to the use of artificial insemination, or they will do so after attempts to achieve a conception by artificial insemination have failed. Some women also seek natural insemination from a donor for various reasons including the desire by them for a 'natural' conception.
Sperm bank processes.
A sperm donor is usually advised not to ejaculate for two to three days before providing the sample, to increase the sperm count. A sperm donor produces and collects sperm at a sperm bank or clinic by masturbation or during sexual intercourse with the use of a collection condom.
Preparing the sperm.
Sperm banks and clinics usually 'wash' the sperm sample to extract sperm from the rest of the material in the semen. A cryoprotectant semen extender is added if the sperm is to be placed in frozen storage in liquid nitrogen, and the sample is then frozen in a number of vials or straws. One sample will be divided into 1-20 vials or straws depending on the quantity of the ejaculate and whether the sample is 'washed' or 'unwashed'. Following the necessary quarantine period, the samples will be thawed and used to inseminate women through artificial insemination or other ART treatments. 'Unwashed' samples are used for ICI treatments, and 'washed' samples are used in IUI and IVF procedures.
Medical issues.
Screening.
Sperm banks typically screen potential donors for genetic diseases, chromosomal abnormalities and sexually transmitted infections that may be transmitted through sperm. The screening procedure generally also includes a quarantine period, in which the samples are frozen and stored for at least 6 months after which the donor will be re-tested for the STIs. This is to ensure no new infections have been acquired or have developed during the period of donation. Providing the result is negative, the sperm samples can be released from quarantine and used in treatments. Children conceived through sperm donation have a birth defect rate of almost a fifth compared with the general population.
Samples required per donor offspring.
The number of donor samples (ejaculates) that are required to help give rise to a child varies substantially from donor to donor, as well as from clinic to clinic. However, the following equations generalize the main factors involved:
For intracervical insemination:
The pregnancy rate increases with increasing number of motile sperm used, but only up to a certain degree, when other factors become limiting instead.
With these numbers, one sample would on average help giving rise to 0.1-0.6 children, that is, it actually takes on average 2-5 samples to make a child.
For intrauterine insemination, a "centrifugation fraction" ("f""c") may be added to the equation:
On the other hand, only 5 million motile sperm may be needed per cycle with IUI ("n""r"=5 million) 
Thus, only 1-3 samples may be needed for a child if used for IUI.
Using ART treatments such as IVF can result in one donor sample (or ejaculate) producing on average considerably more than one birth. However, the actual number of births per sample will depend on the actual ART method used, the age and medical condition of the woman bearing the child, and the quality of the embryos produced by fertilization. Donor sperm is less commonly used for IVF treatments than for artificial insemination. This is because IVF treatments are usually required only when there is a problem with the female conceiving, or where there is a 'male factor problem' involving the woman's partner. Donor sperm is also used for IVF in surrogacy arrangements where an embryo may be created in an IVF procedure using donor sperm and this is then implanted in a surrogate. In a case where IVF treatments are employed using donor sperm, surplus embryos may be donated to other women or couples and used in embryo transfer procedures. When donor sperm is used for IVF treatments, there is a risk that large numbers of children will be born from a single donor, and many sperm banks therefore limit the amount of semen from each donor which is prepared for IVF use, or they may restrict the period of time for which such a donor donates his sperm to perhaps as little as three months (about nine or ten ejaculates).
Choosing donors.
Information about donor.
In the US, sperm banks maintain lists or catalogues of donors which provide basic information about the donor such as racial origin, skin color, height, weight, colour of eyes, and blood group. Some of these catalogues are available for browsing via the Internet, while others are only made available to patients when they apply to a sperm bank for treatment. Some sperm banks make additional information about each donor available for an additional fee, and others make additional basic information known to children produced from donors when those children reach the age of eighteen. Some clinics offer "exclusive donors" whose sperm is only used to produce pregnancies for one recipient woman. How accurate this is, or can be, is not known, and neither is it known whether the information produced by sperm banks, or by the donors themselves, is true. Many sperm banks will, however, carry out whatever checks they can to verify the information they request, such as checking the identity of the donor and contacting his own doctor to verify medical details. Simply because such information is not verifiable does not imply that it is in any way inaccurate, and a sperm bank will rely upon its reputation which, in turn, will be based upon its success rate and upon the accuracy of the information about its donors which it makes available.
In the UK, most donors are anonymous at the point of donation and recipients can only see non-identifying information about their donor (height, weight, ethnicity etc.). Donors need to provide identifying information to the clinic and clinics will usually ask the donor's GP to confirm any medical details they have been given. Donors are asked to provide a pen portrait of themselves which is held by the HFEA and can be obtained by the adult conceived from the donation at the age of 18, along with identifying information such as the donor's name and last known address. Known donation is permitted and it is not uncommon for family or friends to donate to a recipient couple.
Qualities that potential recipients typically prefer in donors include the donors being tall, college educated, and with a consistently high sperm count.
A review came to the result that 68% of donors had given information to the clinical staff regarding physical characteristics and education but only 16% had provided additional information such as hereditary aptitudes and temperament or character.
Other screening criteria.
Sexually active gay men are prohibited or discouraged from donating in some countries, including the United States. Some sperm banks also screen out some potential donors based on height, baldness, and family medical history.
Number of offspring.
Where a sperm donor donates sperm through a sperm bank, the sperm bank will generally undertake a number of medical and scientific checks to ensure that the donor produces sperm of sufficient quantity and quality and that the donor is healthy and will not pass diseases through the use of his sperm. The donor's sperm must also withstand the freezing and thawing process necessary to store and quarantine the sperm. The cost to the sperm bank for such tests is considerable. This normally means that clinics may use the same donor to produce a number of pregnancies in a number of different women.
The number of children permitted to be born from a single donor varies according to law and practice. These laws are designed to protect the children produced by sperm donation from consanguinity in later life: they are not intended to protect the sperm donor himself and those donating sperm will be aware that their donations may give rise to numerous pregnancies in different jurisdictions. Such laws, where they exist, vary from state to state, and a sperm bank may also impose its own limits. The latter will be based on the reports of pregnancies which the sperm bank receives, although this relies upon the accuracy of the returns and the actual number of pregnancies may therefore be somewhat higher. Nevertheless, sperm banks frequently impose a lower limit on geographical numbers than some US states and may also limit the overall number of pregnancies which are permitted from a single donor. When calculating the numbers of children born from each donor, the number of siblings produced in any 'family' as a result of sperm donation from the same donor are almost always excluded. There is, of course, no limit to the number of offspring which may be produced from a single donor where he supplies his sperm privately.
Despite the laws limiting the number of offspring, some donors may produce substantial numbers of children, particularly where they donate through different clinics, where sperm is onsold or is exported to different jurisdictions, and where countries or states do not have a central register of donors.
Sperm agencies, in contrast to sperm banks, rarely impose or enforce limits on the numbers of children which may be produced by a particular donor partly because they are not empowered to demand a report of a pregnancy from recipients and they are rarely, if ever, able to guarantee that a woman may have a subsequent sibling by the donor who was the biological father of her first or earlier children.
Siblings.
Where a woman wishes to have additional children by sperm donation, she will often wish to have these by the same donor. The advantage of having subsequent children by the same donor is that these will be full biological siblings, having the same biological father and mother. Many sperm banks offer a service of storing sperm for future pregnancies, but few will otherwise guarantee that sperm from the original donor will be available in the future.
Sperm banks rarely impose limits on the numbers of second or subsequent siblings. Even where there are limits on the use of sperm by a particular donor to a defined number of families (as in the UK) the actual number of children produced from each donor will often be far greater.
Donor payment.
The majority of sperm donors who donate their sperm through a sperm bank receive some kind of payment, although this is rarely a significant amount. A review including 29 studies from 9 countries came to the result that the amount of money actual donors received for their donation varied from $10 to €70 per donation or sample. The payments vary from the situation in the United Kingdom where donors are only entitled to their expenses in connection with the donation, to the situation with some US sperm banks where a donor receives a set fee for each donation plus an additional amount for each vial stored. At one prominent California sperm bank for example, TSBC, donors receive roughly $50 for each donation (ejaculation) which has acceptable motility/survival rates both at donation and at a test-thaw a couple of days later. Because of the requirement for the two-day abstinence period before donation, and geographical factors which usually require the donor to travel, it is not a viable way to earn a significant income—and is far less lucrative than selling human eggs. Some private donors may seek remuneration although others donate for altruistic reasons. According to the EU Tissue Directive donors in EU may only receive compensation, which is strictly limited to making good the expenses and inconveniences related to the donation. A survey among sperm donors in Cryos International Sperm bank showed that altruistic as well as financial motives were the main factors for becoming a donor. However, when the compensation was increased 100% in 2004 (to DKK 500) it had no significant impact on neither the numbers of new donor candidates coming in nor the frequency of donations from the existing donors. When the compensation was reduced to the previous level (DKK 250) again one year later in 2005 there was no effect either. This led to the assumption that altruism is the main motive and that financial compensation is secondary.
Equipment to collect, freeze and store sperm is available to the public notably through certain US outlets, and some donors process and store their own sperm which they then sell via the Internet.
The selling price of processed and stored sperm is considerably more than the sums which are received by donors. Treatments with donor sperm are generally expensive and are seldom available free of charge through national health services. Sperm banks often package treatments into e.g. three cycles, and in cases of IVF or other ART treatments, they may reduce the charge if a patient donates any spare embryos which are produced through the treatment. There is often more demand for fertility treatment with donor sperm than there is donor sperm available, and this has the effect of keeping the cost of such treatments reasonably high.
Onselling.
There is a market for vials of processed sperm and for various reasons a sperm bank may sell-on stocks of vials which it holds (known as 'onselling'). Onselling therefore enables a sperm bank to maximize the sale and disposal of sperm samples which it has processed. The reasons for onselling may be where part of, or even the main business of, a particular sperm bank is to process and store sperm rather than to use it in fertility treatments, or where a sperm bank is able to collect and store more sperm than it can use within nationally set limits. In the latter case a sperm bank may sell on sperm from a particular donor for use in another jurisdiction after the number of pregnancies achieved from that donor has reached its national maximum.
Psychological issues.

Many donees do not tell the child that they were conceived as a result of sperm donation, or, when non-anonymous donor sperm has been used, they do not tell the child until they are old enough for the clinic to provide the contact information about the donor. Some believe that it is a human right for a person to know who their biological mother and father are, and thus it should be illegal to conceal this information in any way and at any time. For donor conceived children who find out after a long period of secrecy, their main grief is usually not the fact that they are not the genetic child of the couple who have raised them, but the fact that the parent or parents have kept information from or lied to them, causing loss of trust.
There are certain circumstances where the child very likely should be told:
The parents' decision-making process of telling the child is influenced by many intrapersonal factors (such as personal confidence), interpersonal factors, as well as social and family life cycle factors. For example, health care staff and support groups have been demonstrated to have an impact on the decision to disclose the procedure. The appropriate age of the child at disclosure is most commonly given at between 7 and 11 years.
Families sharing same donor.
Having contact and meeting among families sharing the same donor generally has positive effects. It gives the child an extended family and helps give the child a sense of identity by answering questions about the donor. It is more common among "open identity"-families headed by single men/women. Less than 1% of those seeking donor-siblings find it a negative experience, and in such cases it is mostly where the parents have disagreed with each other about how the relationship should proceed.
Other family members.
Parents of donors, who are the grandparents of donor offspring and may therefore be the oldest surviving progenitors, may regard the donated genetic contribution as a family asset, and may regard the donor conceived people as their grandchildren.
A review came to the result that a minority of actual donors involved their partner in the decision-making process of becoming a donor. In one study, 25% of donors felt they needed permission from their partner. In another study, however, 37% of donors with a partner did not approve of a consent form for partners and rather felt that donors should make their own decisions. In a Swedish study, donors reported either enthusiastic or neutral responses from their partners concerning sperm donation.
Motivation vs reluctance to donate.
A systematic review came to the result that altruism and financial compensation are the main motivations to donate, and to a lesser degree procreation or genetic fatherhood and questions about the donor's own fertility. Financial compensation is generally more prevalent than altruism as a motivation among donors in countries were the compensation is large, which is largely explained by a larger number of economically driven people becoming donors in such countries. Among men who do not donate, the main reason thereof has been stated to be a lack of motivation rather than concerns about the donation.
Reluctance to donate may be caused by a sense of ownership and responsibility for the well-being of the offspring.
Support for donors.
In the UK, the National Gamete Donation Trust is a charity which provides information, advice and support for people wishing to become egg, sperm or embryo donors. The Trust runs a national helpline and online discussion list for donors to talk to each other.
In one Danish study, 40% of donors felt happy thinking about possible offspring, but 40% of donors sometimes worried about the future of resulting offspring.
A review came to the result that one in three actual donors would like counselling to address certain implications of their donation, expecting that counselling could help them to give their decision some thought and to look at all the involved parties in the donation.
A systematic review in 2012 came to the conclusion that the psychosocial needs and experiences of the donors, and their follow-up and counselling are largely neglected in studies on sperm donation.
Ethical and legal issues.
Anonymity.
Anonymous sperm donation is where the child and/or receiving couple will never get to know the identity of the donor, and non-anonymous when they will. A donor who makes a non-anonymous sperm donation is termed a "known donor", "open identity" or "identity release" donor.
Non-anonymous sperm donors are, to a substantially higher degree, driven by altruistic motives for their donations.
Even with anonymous donation, some information about the donor may be released to the woman/couple at the time of treatment. "Limited donor information" includes height, weight, eye, skin and hair colour. In Sweden, this is all the information a receiver gets. In the US, on the other hand, additional information may be given, such as a comprehensive biography and sound/video samples.
Several jurisdictions, e.g. Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Britain, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand, and others, only allow non-anonymous sperm donation, generally based on the principle that the child has a right to knowledge of his/her biological origins which led to a unique German court precedent for a 21-year old young woman in 2013 Generally this jurisdictions are implemented by requiring sperm banks to keep up to date records and release identifying information about the donor to his offspring after they reach a certain age (15-18). See Sperm donation laws by country
Attitudes towards anonymity.
For most sperm recipients, anonymity of the donor is not of major importance at the obtainment or tryer-stage. Anonymous sperm is often cheaper, but another reason that recipients choose anonymous donors is concern about the role that the donor or the child may want the donor to play in the child's life. On the other hand, they may prefer a non-anonymous donor if they anticipate that their child will know that they were born from donor sperm and seek more information about their donor in the future. A Dutch study found that lesbian couples are significantly more likely (98%) to choose non-anonymous donors than heterosexual couples (63%), among whom 83% did not intend to ever inform their child even of the fact that they were born of donor sperm.
For some donor conceived children, on the other hand, it may be psychologically burdensome not having the possibility of contacting or knowing almost nothing about the biological father. Thus far, studies have found that a significant minority of donor conceived children want contact towards their biological father.
Among donors and potential donors.
Among donors, a systematic review of 29 studies from 9 countries came to the result that 20-50% of donors would still be willing to donate even if anonymity could not be guaranteed. Between 40 to 97% of donors agree to release non-identifying information such as physical characteristics and level of education. The proportion of actual donors wishing for contact with their off-spring varies between 10 and 88%. Most donors are
not open to contact with offspring, although more open attitudes are observed among single donors and homosexual donors. About half of the donors feel that degree of involvement
should be decided by the intended parents. Some of the donors prefer contact with offspring in a non-visible way, such as where the child can ask questions but the donor will not reveal his identity. One study recruited donors through the Donor Sibling Registry who wanted contact with offspring or who had already made contact with offspring. It came to the result that none of the donors said that there was "no relationship", a third of donors felt it was a special relationship, almost like a very good friend, a quarter felt it was merely a genetic bond and nothing more, while 15% of actual donors considered offspring to be "their own children". On the whole, donors feel that the first step towards contact should come from offspring (not parents or
the donor himself). Some even say that it is the moral responsibility of the donor not to seek contact with offspring.
The same review came to the result that up to 37% of donors reported changes in their attitude towards anonymity before and after donation, with one of four being prepared to be more open about themselves after the donation than before (as a "potential donor"). Among potential donors, 30–46% of potential donors would still be willing to donate even if anonymity could not be guaranteed. Still, more than 75% of these potential donors felt positive towards releasing non-identifying information to offspring, such as physical characteristics and level of education. Single or homosexual men are significantly more inclined to release their identity than married, heterosexual men. Potential donors with children are less inclined to want to meet offspring than potential donors without children (9 versus 30% in the review). Potential donors in a relationship are less inclined to consider contact with offspring than single potential donors (7 versus 28% in the review). From US data, 20% would actively want to know and meet offspring and 40% would not object if the child wished to meet but would not solicit a meeting themselves. From Swedish data, where only non-anonymous donation is permitted in clinics, 87% of potential donors had a positive attitude towards future contact with offspring, although 80% of these potential donors did not feel that the donor had any moral responsibilities for the child later in life. Also from UK data, 80% of potential donors did not feel responsible for whatever happened with their sperm after the donation. With variation between different studies, between 33% and 94% of potential donors want to know at least whether or not the donation resulted in offspring. Some of these potential donors merely wanted to know if a pregnancy had been achieved but did not want to know any specific information about the offspring (e.g. sex, date of birth). Other potential donors felt that knowing the outcome of the donation made the experience more meaningful. In comparison, a German study came to the result that 11% of donors actually asked about the outcome in the clinic where they donated.
An Australian study came to the result that potential donors who would still be willing to donate without a guarantee of anonymity were not automatically more open to extended or intimate contact with offspring.
Donor tracking.
Even when donors choose to be anonymous, offspring may still find ways to learn more about their biological origins. Registries and DNA-databases have been developed for this purpose. Registries that help donor-conceived offspring identify half-siblings from other mothers also help avoid accidental incest in adulthood.
Tracking by registries.
Offspring of anonymous donors may often have the ability to obtain their biological father's donor number from the fertility clinic or sperm bank used for their birth. They may then share their number on a registry. By finding shared donor numbers, offspring may find their genetic half-siblings. The donor may also find his number on a registry and choose to make contact with his offspring or otherwise reveal his identity.
Tracking by DNA-databases.
Even sperm donors who have chosen anonymity and not to contact their offspring through a registry are now increasingly being traced by their children. Improved DNA technology has brought into question the possibility of assuring a donor's anonymity. For example, at least one child found his biological father using his own DNA test and internet research, and was able to identify and contact his anonymous donor.
Fertility tourism and international sperm markets.
Different factors motivate individuals to seek sperm from outside their home state. For example, some jurisdictions do not allow unmarried women to receive donor sperm. Jurisdictional regulatory choices as well as cultural factors that discourage sperm donation have also led to international fertility tourism and sperm markets.
Sweden.
When Sweden banned anonymous sperm donation in 1980, the number of active sperm donors dropped from approximately 200 to 30. Sweden now has an 18-month-long waiting list for donor sperm. At least 250 Swedish sperm recipients travel to Denmark annually for insemination. Some of this is also due to the fact that Denmark also allows single women to be inseminated.
United Kingdom.
After the United Kingdom ended anonymous sperm donation in 2005, the numbers of sperm donors went up, reversing a three-year decline. However, there is still a shortage, and some doctors have suggested raising the limit of children per donor. Some UK clinics import sperm from Scandinavia.
Despite the shortage, sperm exports from the UK are legal (subject to the EU Directive on Tissue Exports) and donors may remain anonymous in this context. In 2009 one Danish clinic secured the approval of the HFEA to import sperm via registered clinics for use in the UK. The sperm must have been processed, stored and quarantined in compliance with UK regulations. The donors have agreed to be identified when the children produced with their sperm reach the age of eighteen. The number of children produced from such donors in the UK will, of course, be subject to HFEA rules (i.e. currently a limit of ten families,) but the donors' sperm may be used worldwide in accordance with the clinic's own limit of one child per 200.000 of population, subject to national or local limits which apply.
In the decade following a law implemented in 2005 which removed the right to anonymity of donors, the shortage of donors accelerated. By 2014 the UK had resorted to importing nearly 40% of its sperm requirements, up from 10% in 2005.
Korea.
Korean Bioethics Law prohibits selling and buying of sperm between clinics, and each donor may only help giving rise to a child to one single couple. It suffers from a shortage.
Canada.
Canada prohibits payment for gamete donation beyond the reimbursement of expenses. Many Canadians import purchased sperm from the United States.
United States.
The United States, which permits monetary compensation for sperm donors, has had an increase in sperm donors during the late 2000s(decade) recession
Social Controversy.
The use of sperm donation is increasingly popular among single women and lesbians. Indeed, some sperm banks and fertility clinics, particularly in the US, Denmark and the UK have a predominance of women being treated with donor sperm who come within these groups and their publicity is aimed at them. This produces many ethical issues around the ideals of conventional parenting and has wider issues for society as a whole, including the issues of the role of men as parents, the issue of family support for children, and the issue of financial support for women with children.
The growth of sperm banks and fertility clinics, the use of sperm agencies and the availability of anonymous donor sperm have served to make the use of sperm donation a more respectable, and therefore a more socially acceptable, procedure. The intervention of doctors and others may be seen as making the whole process a respectable and merely a medical procedure which raises no moral issues, where donor inseminations may be referred to as 'treatments' and donor children as 'resulting from the use of a donor's sperm', or 'born following donaton' and subsequent children may be described as 'born using the same donor' rather than as biological children of the same man.
A study has indicated that both men and women view the use of donor sperm with more skepticism compared with the use of donor eggs, suggesting a unique underlying perception regarding the use of male donor gametes.
As acceptance of sperm donation has generally increased, so has the level of questioning as to whether 'artificial' means of conception are necessary, and some donor children too, have been critical of the procedures which were taken to bring them into the world. Against this background has been the increase in the use of NI as a method of sperm donation. However, while some donors may be willing to offer this as a method of impregnation, it has many critics and it also raises further legal and social challenges.
Some donor children grow up wishing to find out who their fathers were, but others may be wary of embarking on such a search since they fear they may find scores of half-siblings who have been produced from the same sperm donor. Even though local laws or rules may restrict the numbers of offspring from a single donor, there are no worldwide limitations or controls and most sperm banks will onsell and export all their remaining stocks of vials of sperm when local maxima have been attained (see 'onselling' above).
One item of research has suggested that donor children have a greater likelihood of substance abuse, mental illness and criminal behavior when grown.However, its motivation and credibility have been questioned.[http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_65970.asp
Coming forward publicly with problems is difficult for donor-conceived people as these issues are very personal and a public statement may attract criticism. Additionally, it may upset their parents if they speak out. A website called Anonymous Us [http://anonymousus.org/stories/index.php?cid=2] has been set up where they can post details of their experiences anonymously, on which there are many accounts of problems.
Religious responses.
There are a wide range of religious responses to sperm donation, with some religious thinkers entirely in support of the use of donor sperm for pregnancy, some who support its use under certain conditions, and some entirely against.
Catholicism.
Catholicism officially opposes both the donation of sperm and the use of donor sperm on the basis that it compromises the sexual unity of the marital relationship and the idea "that the procreation of a human person be brought about as the fruit of the conjugal act specific to the love between spouses."
Judaism.
Jewish thinkers hold a broad range of positions on sperm donation. Some Jewish communities are totally against sperm donation from donors that are not the husbands of the recipient, others have approved the use of donor insemination in some form, while liberal communities accept it entirely.
Protestantism.
The Southern Baptist Convention holds that sperm donation from a third party is a violation of the marital bond.
History.
In 1790, Scottish anatomist and surgeon Dr. John Hunter reported that he had successfully inseminated the wife of a linen draper using her husband's sperm.
In 1884, Professor William Pancoast of Philadelphia's Jefferson Medical College performed an insemination on the wife of a sterile Quaker merchant. Instead of taking the sperm from the husband, the professor chloroformed the woman, then let his medical students vote which one of among them was "best looking", with that elected one providing the sperm for the insemination. At the husband's request, his wife was never told how she became pregnant. As a result of this medical school experiment, the merchant's wife gave birth to a son, who became the first known child by donor insemination. The case was not revealed until 1909, when a letter by Addison Davis Hard appeared in the American journal "Medical World", highlighting the procedure.
Since then, a few doctors began to perform private donor insemination. Such procedures were regarded as intensely private, if not secret, by the parties involved. Records were usually not maintained so that donors could not be identified for paternity proceedings. Technology permitted the use of fresh sperm only, and it is thought that sperm largely came from the doctors and their male staff, although occasionally they would engage private donors who were able to donate on short notice on a regular basis.
The first successful human pregnancy using frozen sperm was in 1953.
Donor insemination remained virtually unknown to the public until 1954. In that year the first comprehensive account of the process was published in The British Medical Journal.
Donor insemination provoked heated public debate. In the United Kingdom, the Archbishop of Canterbury established the first in a long procession of commissions that, over the years, inquired into the practice. It was at first condemned by the Lambeth Conference, which recommended that it be made a criminal offence. A Parliamentary Commission agreed. In Italy, the Pope declared donor insemination a sin, and proposed that anyone using the procedure be sent to prison.
In many western countries, sperm donation is now a largely accepted procedure. In the US and elsewhere, there has been considerable growth in the number of sperm banks. A sperm bank in the US pioneered the use of on-line search catalogues for donor sperm, and these facilities are now widely available on the websites of sperm banks and fertility clinics.
Recent years have also seen sperm donation become relatively less popular among heterosexual couples, who now have access to more sophisticated fertility treatments, and more popular among single women and lesbian couples - whose access to the procedure is relatively new and still prohibited in some jurisdictions.
United States.
In 1954, the Superior Court of Cook County, Illinois granted a husband a divorce because, regardless of the husband's consent, the woman's donor insemination constituted adultery, and that donor insemination was "contrary to public policy and good morals, and considered adultery on the mother's part." The ruling went on to say that, "A child so conceived, was born out of wedlock and therefore illegitimate. As such, it is the child of the mother, and the father has no rights or interest in said child."
However, the following year, Georgia became the first state to pass a statute legitimizing children conceived by donor insemination, on the condition that both the husband and wife consented in advance in writing to the procedure.
In 1973 the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, and a year later, the American Bar Association, approved the Uniform Parentage Act. This act provides that if a wife is artificially inseminated with donor semen under a physician's supervision, and with her husband's consent, the husband is legally considered the natural father of the donor inseminated child. That law was followed by similar legislation in many states.
The first commercial sperm bank in the United States opened in Roseville, Minnesota in 1971.
United Kingdom.
In the United Kingdom, the Warnock Committee was formed in July 1982 to consider issues of sperm donation and assisted reproduction techniques. Donor insemination was already available in the UK through unregulated clinics such as BPAS. The Committee's report was published on July 18, 1984. and led to the passing of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. That act provided for a system of licensing for fertility clinics and procedures. It also provided that, where a man donates sperm at a licensed clinic in the UK and his sperm is used at a UK clinic to impregnate a woman, the man is not legally responsible for the resulting child.
The 1990 Act also established a UK central register of donors and donor births to be maintained by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (the 'HFEA'), a supervisory body established by the Act. Following the Act, for any act of sperm donation through a licensed UK clinic that results in a living child, information on the child and the donor must be recorded on the register. This measure was intended to reduce the risk of consanguinity as well as to enforce the limit on the number of births permitted by each donor. The natural child of any donor has access to non-identifying information about their donor, starting at the child's eighteenth birthday.
The emphasis of the 1990 Act was on protecting the unborn child. However, a general shortage of donor sperm at the end of the 20th century, exacerbated by the announcement of the removal of anonymity in the UK, led to concerns about the excessive use of the sperm of some donors. These concerns centered on the export and exchange of donor sperm with overseas clinics, and also the interpretation of the term 'sibling use' to include donated embryos produced from one sperm donor, and successive births by surrogates using eggs from different women but sperm from the same sperm donor. Donors were informed that up to ten births could be produced from their sperm, but the words 'other than in exceptional circumstances' in the consent form could potentially lead to many more pregnancies. These concerns led to the SEED Report commissioned by the HFEA, which was in turn followed by new legislation and rules meant to protect the interests of donors: When a man donates his sperm through a UK clinic, that sperm is not permitted to give rise to more than ten families total, anywhere in the world.
International comparison.
On the global market, Denmark has a well-developed system of sperm export. This success mainly comes from the reputation of Danish sperm donors for being of high quality and, in contrast with the law in the other Nordic countries, gives donors the choice of being either anonymous or non-anonymous to the receiving couple. Furthermore, Nordic sperm donors tend to be tall, with rarer features like blond hair or different color eyes and a light complexion, and highly educated and have altruistic motives for their donations, partly due to the relatively low monetary compensation in Nordic countries. More than 50 countries worldwide are importers of Danish sperm, including Paraguay, Canada, Kenya, and Hong Kong. Several UK clinics also export donor sperm but they must take steps to ensure that the maximum number of ten families produced from each donor is not exceeded. The use of the sperm outside the UK will also be subject to local rules. Within the EU there are now regulations governing the transfer of human tissue including sperm between member states to ensure that these take place between registered sperm banks. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US has banned import of any sperm, motivated by a risk of mad cow disease, although such a risk is insignificant, since artificial insemination is very different from the route of transmission of mad cow disease. The prevalence of mad cow disease is one in a million, probably less for donors. If prevalence was the case, the infectious proteins would then have to cross the blood-testis barrier to make transmission possible. Transmission of the disease by an insemination is approximately equal to the risk of getting killed by lightning.
Fictional representation.
Movie plots involving artificial insemination by donor are seen in "Made in America", "Road Trip", "The Back-Up Plan", "The Kids Are All Right (film)", "The Switch (film)", and "Baby Mama", the latter also involving surrogacy.
Films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s (decade), although the techniques have been available for decades. Yet, the amount of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever growing, and the variety of trials and struggles is huge.
A 2012 Bollywood comedy movie Vicky Donor, was based on sperm donation. The film release saw an impact, wherein the number of men donating sperm increased in India.

Andrea Ossoinack

Andrea Ossoinack (1876-1965) was a businessman and politician who became notable in the process of creating the Free State of Fiume.
Andrea was the son of Luigi Ossoinack, who was one of the foremost businessmen in Fiume. Ossoinack studied economics in England, and then spent some time at this father's company branch office in London.
After initially helping Riccardo Zanella and his Autonomist Association, Ossoinack later founded the Autonomist League (Lega autonoma) with the Hungarian loyalist grouping.
In 1916 he was nominated (not elected) deputy from Fiume at the Hungarian Parliament. At the end of the I World War Andrea Ossoinack, on October the 18th 1918, at the Hungarian parliament, claimed for his city the right of self-determination. In this capacity he was also allowed to represent Fiume at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, on the 3rd March 1919 Andrea Ossoinack was appointed “Representative of Fiume“ at the Paris Peace Conference, being presented as the “last deputy of Fiume at the Hungarian Parliament”.
Ossoinack was the ideal choice to represent Fiume. He was the foremost local entrepreneur with excellent business and political contacts with all the lands with which Fiume was connected. Deeply rooted in local political life he financed all the political organisation of Fiume including the autonomists of Maylender and Zanella. Moreover, Ossoinack spoke several languages and, having studied economics in London, was fluent in English. Moreover, he had the knowledge and information of the economy of Fiume and a clear vision of the future prospects. 
Ossoinack came to the Conference with a Memorandum from the CNI with views similar to those presented in Budapest. The document begins with the claim that a profoundly unjust political system (the Habsburg Monarchy) founded on the principle of "divide et impera" was finally turned down. On the ruins of that system several new states were formed, and among them there was Fiume. “The State of Fiume is a living fact: none can deny it, as non can deny existence of a Hungary or of a Yugoslavia. Fiume exercises all the functions of State; this has been communicated to the governments of Europe and America; it freely develops all the functions of administration”. On this ground as a sovereign political body, a functioning state, has the right to be annexed to Italy, since this was the will of the majority of the population.
Andrea Ossoinack met with United States President Woodrow Wilson on April, the 4th 1919 - a day after the meeting of the Council of Four where Wilson resolutely opposed Italian pretensions to Fiume. Wilson added also new requirements: self-determination in the eastern Adriatic area had also to produce economically viable outcomes. Andrea Ossoinack produced an economically grounded argument for the annexation of Fiume to Italy. His argumentation tried to show that annexation was the best economic solution for Fiume.
Openly he proclaimed that the free port was economically non-viable: it could have been made able to compete only if had lower operating costs. This was not the case - the port of Fiume prospered only because it was generously subsidised by the Hungarian government and this was not the case had it gained independence. Fiume in other words, needed a strong state ready to pour investments that its port heart of the city economy desperately needed.
In his reply to Andrea Ossoinack, Wilson proposed that Fiume had to be proclaimed a Free State, as a new solution. This paved the way for a relatively unknown obscure figure such as Ruggiero Gotthardi to emerge and to present officially in Paris at the Peace Conference his proposal for a Free State of Fiume.
When also the British delegate Balfour decidedly refused the project of annexing Fiume, the Italian delegation with Orlando and Sonnino on the 24th of April 1919, left the conference for protest, and wrote an address to Wilson that became a world sensation.

Art Brut vs. Satan

Art Brut vs. Satan is the third album by Art Brut, released on 20 April 2009. The lead-off single from the album was "Alcoholics Unanimous". The album was produced by Frank Black.
The album cover was designed by Canadian cartoonist Jeff Lemire.
Writing and recording.
Explaining the concept behind Art Brut vs Satan, Argos has said; "With the first album, we were at our jobs still, so we were in studio at separate times and didn’t see each other the whole time. I thought that was kind of weird. On the It's A Bit Complicated, we tried to make a pop album and were tracking it individually as well, but we realized we’re a punk band and wanted to do this album live for the first time and went into a room and bashed it out and pressed record and often went with the first take. Our songs are true stories and I wanted to do them once or twice and record them because you’ll lose that sincerity if you do that again and again and again". As such, the decision to work with Frank Black was a simple one. "After we realized we wanted to do that we asked “who is the expert at doing that?” and came up with Frank Black because that’s how he did all of the (Frank Black and the) Catholics’ albums. And also, he’s cool and we wanted to hang out with him. (laughs) “What excuse could we use to hire Frank Black?” And then he said that he liked us, so we signed him up".
"It was amazing, I was so glad when he agreed to do it. I thought I would be intimidated, because it’s Black Francis you know? But it wasn’t, it was amazing. He picked us up at the airport in his car, and he’s just such a friendly enthusiastic man. It’s hard to be intimidated by him, really, as he’s just a good person."
"In the end, he was more like a conductor – we’d rehearse, he’d suggest things and then we’d record it in one take". "He saw the recording process exactly as we saw it", Jasper elaboarates. "There was very little overdubbing and guitar trickery. We recorded it all live with Charles concentrating on song arrangement rather than on specific sounds. He let the whole thing run very naturally. As we were playing it all live we got a chance to try and capture some of the energy from the stage show, which for us is very important. I can't imagine recording each part individually now. It seems a little contrived. He was everything we could have expected and more." As a result, the album was completed very quickly. "We recorded the album in a punk-as-fuck two weeks. With Black Francis conducting us, we pressed record, jumped around and played our songs. This is how I always thought albums were made and it’s definitely how we’re doing it from now on".
Reception.
Initial critical response to "Art Brut vs. Satan" was generally positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 75, based on 24 reviews. Pitchfork awarded the album a positive 7.7, stating in their review that "Frank Black gets the Art Brut spirit down on record better than anyone has before, with the blazing pop-metal vainglory of Weezer, the scruffy cheekiness of early Rough Trade bands, and lots of enthusiastic backing vocals. Fun for them, fun for us". NME's 8/10 review praised Eddie's "Jarvis-like confessional approach", particularly praising 'Am I Normal?', saying "the image of a 14-year-old Argos cowering from the object of his affections behind the magazine racks in WH Smith: truly, this is the indiest notion of all time." "Spin" gave the album 7/10, and said: "In a world where nothing is a metaphor, singer argos still just digs 'DC Comics and Chocolate Milkshakes,' 'The Replacements,' and records that are 'Slap Dash for No Cash.' And as long as he does, the band behind him will give him three chords and a wink".
Crawdaddy! gave the album a glowing review, praising the group's "unbridled enthusiasm for the genre that they love and pay homage to". They also noted that "The Frank Black-helmed production lends Art Brut newfound confidence"
Track listing.
An additional track, "Just Desserts" was recorded in the same sessions, and not included on the album, but leaked to the internet in advance of the album's release.
Two singles were released from the album. "Alcoholics Unanimous" came out two weeks before the album featuring "Just Desserts" as a B-side. "DC Comics & Chocolate Milkshake" was released as the second single in August as a download only featuring "Weird Science" as a B-side.

Lactation

Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young. The process can occur with almost all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it predates mammals. In humans the process of feeding milk is also called "breastfeeding" or "nursing". 
In most species, milk comes out of the mother's nipples; however, the platypus (a non-placental mammal) releases milk through ducts in its abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat, is milk production a normal male function.
"Galactopoiesis" is the maintenance of milk production. This stage requires prolactin (PRL) and oxytocin.
Newborn infants often produce some witch's milk.
Galactorrhea is milk production unrelated to nursing, it can occur in males and females of many mammal species as result of hormonal imbalances or unusual physiological stimuli.
Purpose.
The chief function of lactation is to provide nutrition and immune protection to the young after birth. In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of infertility, which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring.
Human lactation.
Hormonal influences.
From the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy (the second and third trimesters), a woman's body produces hormones that stimulate the growth of the milk duct system in the breasts:
By the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy, the breasts are ready to produce milk. It is also possible to induce lactation without pregnancy.
Secretory Differentiation.
During the latter part of pregnancy, the woman's breasts enter into the "Secretory Differentiation" stage. This is when the breasts make colostrum (see below), a thick, sometimes yellowish fluid. At this stage, high levels of progesterone inhibit most milk production. It is not a medical concern if a pregnant woman leaks any colostrum before her baby's birth, nor is it an indication of future milk production.
Secretory Activation.
At birth, prolactin levels remain high, while the delivery of the placenta results in a sudden drop in progesterone, estrogen, and HPL levels. This abrupt withdrawal of progesterone in the presence of high prolactin levels stimulates the copious milk production of "Secretory Activation".
When the breast is stimulated, prolactin levels in the blood rise, peak in about 45 minutes, and return to the pre-breastfeeding state about three hours later. The release of prolactin triggers the cells in the alveoli to make milk. Prolactin also transfers to the breast milk. Some research indicates that prolactin in milk is greater at times of higher milk production, and lower when breasts are fuller, and that the highest levels tend to occur between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.
Other hormones—notably insulin, thyroxine, and cortisol—are also involved, but their roles are not yet well understood. Although biochemical markers indicate that Secretory Activation begins about 30–40 hours after birth, mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness (the sensation of milk "coming in the breast") until 50–73 hours (2–3 days) after birth. 
Colostrum is the first milk a breastfed baby receives. It contains higher amounts of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk, and is especially high in immunoglobulin A (IgA), which coats the lining of the baby's immature intestines, and helps to prevent pathogens from invading the baby's system. Secretory IgA also helps prevent food allergies. Over the first two weeks after the birth, colostrum production slowly gives way to mature breast milk.
Autocrine control - Galactapoiesis.
The hormonal endocrine control system drives milk production during pregnancy and the first few days after the birth. When the milk supply is more firmly established, autocrine (or local) control system begins. 
During this stage, the more that milk is removed from the breasts, the more the breast will produce milk. Research also suggests that draining the breasts more fully also increases the rate of milk production. Thus the milk supply is strongly influenced by how often the baby feeds and how well it is able to transfer milk from the breast. Low supply can often be traced to: 
Milk ejection reflex.
This is the mechanism by which milk is transported from the breast alveoli to the nipple. Suckling by the baby stimulates the paraventricular nuclei and supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus, which signals to the posterior pituitary gland to produce oxytocin. Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli, which already hold milk. The increased pressure causes milk to flow through the duct system and be released through the nipple. This response can be conditioned e.g. to the cry of the baby.
Milk ejection is initiated in the mother's breast by the act of suckling by the baby. The milk ejection reflex (also called let-down reflex) is not always consistent, especially at first. Once a woman is conditioned to nursing, let-down can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including the sound of any baby. Even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex, causing unwanted leakage, or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast. However, this and other problems often settle after two weeks of feeding. Stress or anxiety can cause difficulties with breastfeeding. The release of the hormone oxytocin leads to the "milk ejection" or "let-down reflex". Oxytocin stimulates the muscles surrounding the breast to squeeze out the milk. Breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently. Some feel a slight tingling, others feel immense amounts of pressure or slight pain/discomfort, and still others do not feel anything different.
A poor milk ejection reflex can be due to sore or cracked nipples, separation from the infant, a history of breast surgery, or tissue damage from prior breast trauma. If a mother has trouble breastfeeding, different methods of assisting the milk ejection reflex may help. These include feeding in a familiar and comfortable location, massage of the breast or back, or warming the breast with a cloth or shower.
Afterpains.
A surge of oxytocin also causes the uterus to contract. During breastfeeding, mothers may feel these contractions as "afterpains". These may range from period-like cramps to strong labour-like contractions and can be more severe with second and subsequent babies.
Lactation without pregnancy, induced lactation, relactation.
In humans, induced lactation and relactation have been observed frequently in primitive cultures, and demonstrated with varying success in adoptive mothers. It appears plausible that the possibility of induction of lactation in women (or females of other species) who are not biological mothers does confer an evolutionary advantage, especially in groups with high maternal mortality and tight social bonds. The phenomenon has been also observed in most primates, in some lemurs, and in dwarf mongooses.
Lactation can be induced in humans by a combination of physical and psychological stimulation, by drugs, or by a combination of those methods. Some couples may stimulate lactation outside of pregnancy for sexual purposes.
Rare accounts of male lactation (as distinct from galactorrhea) exist in historical medical and anthropological literature, although the phenomenon has not been confirmed by more recent literature.
Evolution.
Charles Darwin recognized that mammary glands seemed to have developed specifically from cutaneous glands, and hypothesized that they evolved from glands in brood pouches of fish, where they would provide nourishment for eggs. The latter aspect of his hypothesis has not been confirmed; however, more recently the same mechanism has been postulated for early synapsids. The discus fish ("Symphysodon aequifasciata") is known for (biparentally) feeding their offspring by epidermal mucus secretion. A closer examination reveals that, as in most mammals, the secretion of the discus fish's nourishing fluid may be controlled by prolactin.
O. T. Oftedal has argued that later therapsids such as cynodonts secreted complex, nutrient-rich milk. This brought them evolutionary advantage by allowing a decline in egg size. However, "Sinocodon", a small early mammal or mammaliomorphan appears to have had teeth from the very earliest age, and probably did not suckle. This may indicate the therapsids used their milk for moistening their eggs only.
During early evolution of lactation, the secretion was through pilosebaceous glands, and "mammary hairs" transported the nourishing fluids to the eggs or young. Later the development of the "mammary patch" rendered mammary hairs obsolete.
Another well known example of nourishing young with secretions of glands is the crop milk of pigeons. Like in mammals and disc fish this also appears closely related to prolactin. Other birds such as flamingos and penguins are utilizing similar feeding techniques.
Lactation is also the hallmark of adenotrophic viviparity - a breeding mechanism developed by some insects, most notably tsetse flies. The single egg of the tse-tse develops into a larva inside the uterus where it is fed by a milky substance secreted by a milk gland inside the uterus. At least one cockroach species is also known to feed their offspring by milky secretions.

Plot.
'Bonny' is harassed by some 'Badmash' on her way back home while a gnarled and wise oldie reminisces about the Raj days remarking that nobody dared to look disrespectfully at anybody’s daughter or sister and that independence has brought us very little that is positive and tangible. Meanwhile the college girl has had enough of the daily harassment at the hands of the men and announces to her bemused parents about her intention of quitting her education altogether.
Both parents are angry that she continue her studies and the father, a righteous honest soul decides that from the next day on he will accompany his daughter on her way to and back from her college. The next day on the way to college the father and daughter are inevitably menaced by the goons and a battle to death ensues with both father and daughter being slaughtered by the evil goons in broad daylight with no apparent fear of police intervention. Moments later the matriarch played by Madame Sangeeta in her highly anticipated return to the screen arrives on the scene and wails away in typical style promising the worst vengeance upon the murderers of her daughter and her husband. Baying for vengeance in the manner that Maula Jat’s mother Dani once did, she lets out a mighty call for her son Ali Sher who like the great Maula Jat has extraordinary sensory capabilities. Seconds later he arrives at the scene and dishes out some true Maula Jat style justice, slaying the beasts in an instant before letting out a guttural cry of victory!
A proud mother gloats at her sons brilliant and swift bloody justice as he is led off to the notorious Macch Jail bellowing loudly that her son is to be known hence not as Ali Sher but as The Sher-e-Lahore to which her son growls his approval while swaggering off. The news of the goons deaths reaches notorious underworld kingpin Bandial (Tariq Shah) who promises to unleash his own terrible vengeance for the murder of his sons and so a deadly and obligatory blood feud between the Sher-e-Lahore and Bandial

Holiday Bowl (building)

The Holiday Bowl was a bowling alley on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in 1958 by five Japanese-Americans and was a significant part of the rebuilding process of the Nikkei community after internment during World War II. The owners of the Holiday Bowl sold shares throughout the community in order to finance its construction."
Cultural significance.
Located on Crenshaw Boulevard, the Holiday Bowl was important in the desegregation of Los Angeles and served an Anglo American, African American, and Japanese American clientele. The coffee shop served grits, udon, chow mein, and hamburgers. The Bowl operated four decades, and was a cultural, architectural, and recreational feature for the Crenshaw district "as the Hollywood Bowl has for the Hollywood Hills". 
The Bowl was built by Japanese entrepreneurs as a combination bowling alley, pool hall, bar and coffee shop in 1958 and served Crenshaw's Japanese residents who "had not long before suffered Manzanar's internment camps and a blanket racial ban by the American Bowling Congress." A Los Angeles Times magazine story noted: "Once haunted at 4 a.m. by swing-shift aerospace workers and nighthawk Central Avenue jazz musicians, the Holiday Bowl, like Leimert Park to its south, remains a concrete expression of community in an era when the whole notion of community has been raised to the level of abstraction." A 1999 LA Weekly story said, "Holiday speaks of Crenshaw’s bright, enduring middle-class dreams, with its ’50s-inspired orange-and-green décor and giant plate-glass window that affords a grand view of Baldwin Hills to the south. Eat your grits and eat your heart out." The article also states that the ownership of the Bowl changed hands several times and offered "a huge cross section of ethnic dishes: Japanese (saifun, yakisoba, donburi), Chinese (a vast assortment of chow mein, pork noodles, foo yong) and black Southern (hot links, grits, salmon patties, short ribs, biscuits and gravy)." 
The owner said he took pride in Holiday’s staying power, in its history, and the fact that it was designed by Armet & Davis, "the architectural firm that popularized Googie-style coffee shops and turned diners like Holiday and the nearby Wich Stand into zig-zaggy emblems of L.A. optimism." He said the building was not damaged during the 1992 Los Angeles riots and that people bowled that night.
Architecture.
The Holiday Bowl is considered an example of Googie architecture and was designed by the Armet & Davis architectural firm. The firm is said to have "defined '50s Googie architecture". Helen Liu Fong was the designer at Armet & Davis who is credited with designing the Holiday Bowl. 
The Bowl was photographed in stereo for 3-D viewing by Jack Laxer.
Closure, fight to save, demolition.
The Bowl closed in 2000 and was targeted for demolition. Bowl supporters mobilized, persuading the City of Los Angeles’s Cultural Heritage Commission to designate the structure an historical-cultural monument. The building features in historic tours and activities. It is listed as number 688 on the City of Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument list. The bowling alley was torn down in October 2003 and replaced with a shopping center. The Coffee Shop, which became a Starbucks Coffee, was spared from demolition along with the signs that were erected for the former alley and the nearby former honda/pontiac dealership. Preservationists wanted the landmark saved for its history, cultural significance, and architectural history.

Fock–Lorentz symmetry

Lorentz invariance follows from two independent postulates: the principle of relativity and the principle of constancy of the speed of light. Dropping the latter
while keeping the former leads to a new invariance,
known as Fock–Lorentz symmetry or the Projective Lorentz Transformation. The general study of such theories began with Fock, who was motivated by the search for the general symmetry group preserving relativity without assuming the constancy of c.
This invariance does not distinguish between inertial frames (and therefore satisfies the principle of relativity) but it allows for a varying speed of light in space c; indeed it allows for a non-invariant c. According to Maxwell's equations the speed of light satisfies
with ε0, μ0 the electric constant and magnetic constant. If the speed of light depends upon the space-time coordinates of the medium, say "x", then:
where χ("x") represents the vacuum as a variable medium.
