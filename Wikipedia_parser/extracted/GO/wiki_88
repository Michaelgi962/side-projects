Three for the Road (TV series)

Three for the Road is an American drama television series that aired on CBS from September to November 1975. The series follows a recently widowed father and his two sons who in an attempt to assuage their grief, sell their house, procure a recreational vehicle, called the "Zebec", and travel around the United States. The program aired at 7 pm EST Sundays from September 14 to November 30, 1975 opposite "The Wonderful World of Disney" on NBC and "The Swiss Family Robinson" on ABC.
Synopsis.
Alex Rocco plays the 39-year-old father, Pete Karras, a free-lance writer and photographer, or photojournalist, in search of material to support his livelihood. Vincent Van Patten plays the 18-year-old, John Karras, and Leif Garrett portrays 13-year-old Endy Karras. The first episode focuses on the Karrases' interest in hang-gliding. Stefanie Powers, prior to her long-term role on ABC's "Hart to Hart", guest starred in the episode "Ghost Story" about a woman who believes her deceased twin sister has been reincarnated.
Other guest stars on "Three for the Road" were Parley Baer, Kathleen Cody, Brian Cutler, Bradford Dillman, Meg Foster, Charles Frank, James Gavin, Clu Gulager, Larry Hagman (as Gordo Thurgate in the episode "Ride on a Red Balloon"), Martin Kove, Judy Lewis, Anne Lockhart, Gary Lockwood, Tim Matheson, Dean Stockwell, Christopher Stone, James Van Patten, and Noble Willingham.
Production notes.
The series was filmed by Mary Tyler Moore's MTM Enterprises, its first 60-minute offering, as well as its first dramatic one. MTM was later absorbed by Fox Television Studios. The CBS news magazine "60 Minutes" moved into the time slot after "Three for the Road" folded, and has occupied that slot ever since. 
Despite the low ratings of the series, Leif Garrett attracted enough attention to become a teen idol of the 1970s. He landed the thirteenth ranking on "TV Guide"'s "25 Greatest Teen Idols" list. Garrett soon received so much fan mail that he was offered a recording contract despite his lack of musical training.

Elena Fidatov

Elena Fidatov, sometimes known as "Elena Fidatof", (born 24 July 1960) is a former Romanian middle- and long-distance runner who competed in track, road, and cross country running competitions. In a period spanning 1984 to 2002, she competed at IAAF World Cross Country Championships on thirteen occasions, making her one of the most frequent participants at the event. She is a two-time Olympian for Romania, having represented her country at the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics.
She ran on the track at the IAAF World Championships in Athletics on three occasions, competing in events from 1500 metres to 5000 metres. She was integral to a number of team medal performances for Romania at the World Cross Country event and also the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. Individually, she won a bronze and a silver medal at the European Cross Country Championships in 1994 and 1997, respectively. Her later career was marred by doping incidents; she was reprieved of a failed test in 1996 but received a two-year ban from the sport in 1998 after testing positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone.
Career.
Born in Tulcea, Romania, Elena Fidatov made her international debut at the 1984 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, reaching the top 40 in the women's long race. She was much improved at the 1985 World Cross Country event and her tenth place finish helped the Romanian women, led by Fiţa Lovin, to the team bronze medal. She was third at the Balkan Cross Country Championships that year and succeeded her compatriot Mariana Chirila to the title the following season. Fidatov came ninth in the long race at the 1986 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. She did not compete internationally in the late 1980s.
Fidatov took the Balkan Cross Country title for a second time in 1990, but managed only 60th place on the world stage. That same year she was fifth over 1500 metres at the 1990 European Athletics Championships. Her focus began to turn to track running and she competed in the 1500 m finals at both the 1991 World Championships in Athletics and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. She doubled up for the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, running in both the 1500 m and 3000 metres, although she failed to progress from the heats stage in either discipline. Her performances did earn her a place in the 3000 m at the 1993 IAAF Grand Prix Final, where she finished sixth. She also improved in the World Cross Country Championships over this period, coming 25th and 26th in the 1992 and 1993 editions, respectively.
With no major track events for prepare for in 1994, her major outing of the year was at the 1994 European Cross Country Championships, where she took the bronze medal and led Romania to the team title with Chirila and Margareta Keszeg. She also made her debut at the 1994 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, where she was fifth and easily took the team title alongside medallists Iulia Negura and Anuţa Cătună. Fidatov competed in world-level events on the road, track and grass in the 1995 season, beginning with 23rd place and a team bronze at the 1995 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, tenth in the 5000 metres final at the 1995 World Championships in Athletics, and culminating in a team gold medal for her sixth place finish at the 1995 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships.
Her 1996 season started with controversy as she failed a doping test in South Africa for a banned diuretic. However, she escaped punishment as a panel accepted that she had used the substance to treat her kidney pain. She retained her World Cross bronze in 1996, in a Romanian team led by an emerging Gabriela Szabo. Her second Olympic appearance, representing Romania in the 5000 m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in August, saw her claim a career best finish in a global track final by coming seventh overall. The following month, she was selected for the marathon relay at the 1996 IAAF World Road Relay Championships and the team (including Iulia Ionescu, Chirila, Lelia Deselnecu, Negura and Luminita Gogârlea) finished as runners-up behind the Ethiopian women.
She had a highly successful cross country season in 1997, taking a series of high profile circuit wins including the Antrim International Cross Country, Cross Zornotza, Cross de San Sebastián, Cross Internacional de Itálica, Eurocross, and Almond Blossom Cross Country. These performances helped rank her in second place on that year's IAAF World Cross Challenge, behind winner Gete Wami. The thirty-six-year-old also had one of her highest placings at the 1997 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, coming twelfth in the women's long race. She ended the year with a silver medal at the 1997 European Cross Country Championships, leading Romania to second place in the team rankings.
She failed a doping control test at the 1998 Cross Zornotza after nandrolone was detected in her system, an infraction which led to a two-year ban from the sport. She did not stop her training during this period and received clearance from the IAAF to take part in the 2000 IAAF World Cross Country Championships. She managed 46th in the short race but only 68th place in the long race that year. She competed twice more at the event, taking 13th in the short race in 2001 (leading Romania to the bronze) and finishing 41st in 2002. These performances brought her total number of career appearances at the competition to thirteen.
In 2000, at the age of 40, she ran the 5,000 metres on the track in 15:20.59 to win the Romanian National Championships. The time is the current W40 Masters World Record in the event.

John Howell &amp; Son

John Howell & Son, known as John Howell, was the leading building and engineering company in Hastings, Sussex in the 1860s. Its founder, John Howell Senior (ca.1825−1893) engineered churches and other public buildings in the area to the designs of innovative architects, including Holy Trinity Church in 1860 to the design of Samuel Sanders Teulon, and St Johns Church, Hollington in 1865−1868 for Edward Alexander Wyon. John Howell Junior (1851−1903) constructed the old Gothic Revival Hastings Grammar School building to the design of Jeffery and Skiller in 1883. Howell Senior was a campaigner on behalf of the Liberal Party and held a prominent political position in the town from the 1860s to the 1880s. He came to Hastings as a fatherless boy, but was the Mayor of Hastings by 1878.
John Howell Senior.
Personal history.
His mother was Sophia Howell of Birmingham, born around 1792. John Howell was born around 1825 in Birmingham, He married Ann Osborne (b. Winchelsea ca.1827; d. Hastings 1886), at Rye in 1850. She was the daughter of Richard Osborne, a carpenter born around 1791 in Winchelsea. John and Ann had three children: John Junior (born Hastings 1851), Ann (b. 1853) and Sophia (b. 1854). Howell died aged 69 at Hastings on 1 December 1893.
He was born in poverty and was fatherless when he came to Hastings as a child; his life and work were based in Hastings. In boyhood he worked as an apprentice carpenter. In 1841, at age seventeen, he was a carpenter living at White Rock Place, Hastings, with his mother Sophia, a lodging-house keeper, and his sister Sophia (b.ca.1823). He became a journeyman carpenter. In 1851, at the age of twenty-six, he was a carpenter employing nineteen men and living with his wife Ann, aged twenty-four, at 21 White Rock, Hastings. He began his independent work by constructing stables for the Local Board in Waterworks Road, Hastings. By 1857 at the age of 33 he was becoming successful: he took on a brickfield at Silverhill and could accept major contracts as one of the town's biggest employers during the expansion of Hastings. In 1861 he was living at 12 Cambridge Gardens with his wife and three children as well as his widowed father-in-law Richard Osborne, two of Osborne's children and a servant, Caroline Phipps, brought from Winchelsea. In 1871 he was forty-six; a timber merchant and contractor employing 120 men. He was living with his wife and children at 50 Havelock Road. In 1881 he was describing himself as a timber merchant and living with his wife, three unmarried children and three female servants at Priory Mount, Cambridge Gardens. The Census of 1891 saw him as a widower and retired contractor, staying at the Palace Hotel at Fairfield, Derbyshire with his daughter Ann who was still single at age thirty-eight, and his granddaughter Margery Carless, aged four years. In spite of his achievements, he was not the major nineteenth-century building contractor in Hastings; that was Peter Jenkins (1869−1899).
Company.
The "Hastings News" said that he was "one of the most prominent members of the Victorian building trade (in Hastings)", that "all he touched seemed to turn to gold," and that "he was popular with his workforce for being firm but fair". The company's office was in a large sawmill between Station Road and the top of the east side of Middle Street. In October 1864 the Council had to ask Howell to relieve the local nuisance caused by smoke from the sawmill, and in January 1865 the mill suffered from severe subsidence. The "Hastings News" said that Howell "had the building shored with nearly forty timber beams, jacks and hydraulic presses. The building was forced back ten to eleven inches over a period of three days". The company organised an annual excursion for the employees: for example on 24 July 1869 seventy men were taken on six wagonettes to the Bell Inn at Northiam, leaving early in the morning and returning at midnight. Howell Senior retired in 1882, and the original company was dissolved, although his son continued in business under the same name.
Political life.
John Howell Senior became a Liberal Party activist in the campaign against the Corn Laws around 1843 when he was a nineteen-year-old apprentice. He was a lifelong campaigner on behalf of the Liberal Party, and was said to have had an effect in Hastings constituency on the 1859 general election. The Tories alleged corruption by Howell but lost their case. Howell's local influence was believed to have assisted two Liberals, Frederick North and Harry Vane, to win the election instead of one Liberal and one Tory as had been expected. After the 1882 council elections: "The Liberals had issued writs in the High Court of Justice charging Cllrs Edwin Smith (All Saints ward), George Edmed (St Clements ward) and George Archibald Thorpe (Holy Trinity ward) with bribery, undue influence, giving ‘treats’ and hiring vehicles to convey voters to the polls". The Liberals lost their case, but were still supported by the "Hastings News", a Liberal newspaper. In response the Tories issued a writ accusing Howell of perjury, citing the method of payment by Howell to Mr Kendal, a private investigator hired to discover evidence of corruption by the Tories in the 1882 election. The Tories were supported by the "Hastings Observer", which "took great delight in the failure of the Liberal case, highlighting the poor quality evidence". The same newspaper "also revived the 1869 case, arguing forcefully that the two Liberals had been elected wrongly". The Tories lost their case against Howell.
Howell was a town councillor in the 1860s and 1870s, although he had to resign as councillor on 11 September 1866 when his tender of £25,640 for the main drainage works was accepted by the Council. He was elected to the first School Board for the borough of Hastings in 1871, and was the first chairman of the Hastings Liberal Association when it was formed in November 1872. He was elected alderman in May 1873, and Mayor of Hastings in 1878. He was elected president of the Liberal Association on 25 January 1883 after he retired from the building business, and was elected councillor representing Holy Trinity Ward on 22 November 1883. This occurred after a husting on 13 September of that year on the cricket ground involving thousands of local people, some bandstands, a fairground, food and an illuminated address to Howell as president of the Hastings Liberal Association.
Works.
His first major work was the west side of Warrior Square, completed in 1855. In the same year, Roman coins were found on this site by Howell's workmen. The Music Hall or Central Assembly Room between Robertson Street and Havelock Road, renamed as the Public Hall in 1883, was begun in July 1858 and built speedily; the opening on 12 January 1859 featured Handel's Messiah. It was an Italianate building with its main entrance in Robertson Street. The main hall on the first floor measured 75 feet by 45 feet and 30 feet high, and its staircases gave access to Havelock Road and Robertson Street. The ground floor had a large room for the Hastings Mechanics' Institution at the west end, and shops at the east end, with a shopping arcade running north-south in the centre. There was an arched cellar in the basement. From the 1920s to the 1970s it was a cinema; today it faces Cambridge Road and the ground floor is occupied by public houses, with music in the cellar. Howell built Holy Trinity Church, Robertson Street, in 1860 for architect Samuel Sanders Teulon; the site cost £2,300. The nave was opened on 29 September 1858 and the chancel on 10 August 1862, but it was consecrated as late as 13 April 1882 due to debt. In July of that year there was strike action by the masons when their employer Howell Senior refused to dismiss a non-union man. Holy Trinity is now a listed building. He engineered the basement of the Queens Hotel in 1862; it exists today in the town conservation area without its cupolas and forecourt, and has been converted into flats.
He also constructed the town’s main drainage works between 1866 and the summer of 1868, for a fee of £25,640. Work started on 12 October 1866. The system ran "from St Leonards Archway via the Priory (near the Memorial) to a large arched tank at Rock-a-Nore holding one and a half million gallons, then to the mouth of an iron outlet pipe off Ecclesbourne Glen". People could now experience "clean bathing in a pure sea": this may explain the necessity for the new drainage system. The work involved embedding planks up to four feet deep into rock. He was the builder of St Johns Church, Hollington, from 1865 to 1868, for architect Edward Alexander Wyon (1842–1872). St John's Church is not listed. Howell was the engineer for the new Council building to the design of Mr Smith; this could be George Smith who lived at Copthorne. The building was opened in 1868 and stood on the corner of Bank Buildings and Middle Street; now the corner of Middle Street and Station Road. St Andrews Church, Queens Road, was begun in November 1869 and completed to the design of Matthew Edward Habershon; Howell's fee was £3,235. It held a congregation of 2,000 and survived until 1970 when it was declared unsafe and demolished.
He bid unsuccessfully for the job of constructing Hastings Pier in 1869 to 1872. However he did win a major contract for the large-scale development of the Cornwallis Estate in 1873. That job included Cambridge Gardens, Cornwallis Gardens and Holmesdale Gardens; March 1873 saw him already laying out Cambridge Gardens on the site of Priory farmyard, and demonstrating his local influence regarding the positioning of adjacent developments. Howell Senior eventually took up residence on the estate at number seven Holmesdale Gardens and called it Priory Mount. It is now the Westwood Centre. Emmanuel Church, Priory Road (now Vicarage Road), was built to the design of Jeffrey & Skiller in 1873. His fee for this job was paid by a local benefactor, Mrs Mendham, who also laid a memorial stone there. In 1875 he engineered a roller skating rink, later called the Cambridge Hall, on the east side of Cambridge Gardens; the site now contains the ESK Warehouse. It was a "large, iron-framed shed with wood panels", 120 ft by 60 ft by 27 ft high, and was opened on 1 February 1875. It was built to the design of "Mr Plumpton of New York" (possibly James Leonard Plimpton) who had designed the skates which would be hired and sold there.
His undated buildings include the London and County Bank which is now the National Westminster Bank. He built the St Mary Magdalen Schools; these are as yet unidentified, but one of them may be the listed Training College, Former Convent of the Holy Child Jesus, Hastings, which was designed by William Wardell. They may alternatively be schools built with funds from the Magdalen charity, including Hastings Grammar School. He built the Memorial Chapel which was in Bank Buildings and is now on the west side of Station Road, and numerous domestic buildings. He is credited with the undated construction of The Hastings and East Sussex Liberal Club building at 4 Pelham Street, Hastings; this is now part of Lloyds Bank in Wellington Place. It was owned by a company, and the Liberals occupied it until it was sold to a judge for £1,700 in 1894.
Buildings by both partners.
John Howell Senior's last work built in cooperation with his son was Robertson Street Congregational Church, Hastings, to the design of Henry Ward (1854−1927). It was built mainly in 1884 to 1885 but completed in the 1890s. It is now a United Reformed Church.
John Howell Junior.
Personal history.
John Howell Junior (born Hastings 1851; died Hastings 1903) was the son and business partner of John Howell Senior; he also practised as a solicitor. He and his wife Lilla had six children, all born at St Leonards: Cecil John (born around 1884); Gladys Lilian (b.ca.1886); Reginald Edward (b.ca.1887); Mabel E.O. (b.ca.1889; Herbert Edgar (b.ca.1890); Wilfred Douglas. (b.ca.1896).
By the time he was nineteen years old in 1871 he was living with his parents in Havelock Road and articled to an attorney. He became a partner in the firm sometime after 1873. By 1881 at age twenty-nine he was describing himself as a timber merchant like his father, and living with his parents at Priory Mount in Cambridge Gardens, Hastings. He continued under the same company name after his father retired in 1882 and the original firm was dissolved. He married Mrs Lilla Harford (b. Barnstaple ca.1856; d. Wandsworth 1930) of Cambridge Gardens, Hastings on 7 June 1882, when his employees received a half-day holiday, an afternoon of entertainment at Field's Farm, Ore and an evening dinner at the Grand Hotel in Queens Road, Hastings. Around a hundred of the men took advantage of this. By 1991 the family was living at Rothesay, Clive Road, Hastings, with five of their children: Cecil, Gladys, Reginald, Mabel and Herbert. They had seven servants living in: a housekeeper, parlourmaid, cook, housemaid, under-nurse, coachman and gardener. The 1901 Census finds John Howell Junior as a solicitor still living with his wife, his stepson Hugh Cardinal Harford (b. Middlesex ca.1877) and five of their children at Rothesay. His eldest son Cecil was at that time a commercial clerk living at a boarding house in Rochester, Kent. John Howell Junior died aged 52 years on 13 December 1903 in his home at 20 Holmesdale Gardens which he had built with his father soon after joining the firm. He left £53,352 in his will.
The 1911 Census saw Lilla Howell as a widow, living at Preston House, Dulwich Road, Herne Hill, with five of her seven children. Hugh was an insurance inspector; Gladys was a costumier, Reginald was a Lloyds shipping agent, Herbert was a flour merchant and Wilfred was a college student. Cecil John spent some time in India as a merchant, and 1925 saw him returning home on the "SS Warwickshire" with his five-year-old son Peter John Howell; they were then living at 27 Pinfold Road, Streatham Hill, London. There is therefore no evidence yet found that John Howell & Son continued as a building or engineering firm after the death of John Howell Junior in 1903.
Works.
John Howell Junior was the engineer of the previous Gothic Revival building for Hastings Grammar School "(pictured above)", designed by Jeffery and Skiller of Havelock Road, Hastings. The foundation stone was laid on 15 September 1882, and the first section was opened on 4 July 1883. It was built on a slope using Kentish ragstone and Bath Stone dressings, and shortage of funds meant that it had to be built in stages. In the first stage the building contained a large schoolroom with "a raised platform at one end and a gallery at the other; four adjoining classrooms; above, space not yet used as part of the second section; below, a covered playground". The second stage included accommodation for thirty boarders and a master. The planned capacity was for up to 140 boys, and cost around £10,000. The school ultimately had an eighty-foot clock tower. Hastings Grammar School was demolished in 1965 or 1966 to be replaced by another building. He built St Peter's Church, Lower Park Road, to the design of James Brooks (1825–1901). The foundation stone was laid in 1883, and it was completed in 1885.

<doc id="31202254" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31202254" title="Listaller">
Listaller

Listaller is a free computer software installation system (similar to a package management system) aimed at making it simple to create a package that can be installed on all Linux distributions as well as providing tools and API to make software management on Linux more user-friendly.
History.
Listaller was started in December 2007 by freedesktop.org developer Matthias Klumpp as an experimental project to explore the possibility of writing a universal user interface to manage all kinds of Linux software, no matter how it was installed.
Therefore, Listaller had backends to manage Autopackage, LOKI, Mojo and native distribution packages. The original project provided one user interface to manage all kinds of installed software. Interaction with the native distribution package management was done via an own abstraction layer, which was later replaced by PackageKit.
Listaller also provided a cross-distribution software installation format which should have made it easier to create packages which run on multiple distributions. The installer part of Listaller was also able to assist in installing Autopackage packages.
The very first versions were written in Object Pascal.
Although the project started as experiment, it soon evolved to a competitor for Autopackage and Mojo.
Until 2011, Listaller never made any stable release. With the announcement of AppStream a lot of the original Listaller goals would be achieved, so the author decided to change Listaller away from a full software manager to a software installer only and joined forces with the AppStream project.
Because Pascal was not considered as ideal language to collaborate with other projects and the project already had spent much time in developing Pascal bindings to third-party libraries, Listaller was rewritten in Vala with a subset of the original features and the main goal to provide seamless integration with AppStream and PackageKit. Therefore the universal software manager part was removed and the project now focuses on creating a cross-distro format for distribution of binary Linux software.
Methodology.
Listaller is intended to be used for installing binary, or pre-compiled, versions of non-core applications such as word processors, web browsers, and personal computer games, rather than core libraries and applications such as operating system shells. Listaller is not intended to provide support for installing system libraries for security reasons.
Listaller is using an own package format, so-called IPK packages (short for Installation package), which are LZMA-compressed signed tarballs.
IPK packages contain only small configuration files to modify the setup process. They do not provide their own logic or scripts which are run during install time. All parts of a setup process are handled by Listaller's built-in routines, which make it possible for distributors to modify the setup process of 3rd-party applications to comply to their own policy, if necessary.
The key value of Listaller is integration into desktop environments, existing package management tools and distributions. Therefore, the project provides several integration components by default, which make it possible to manage Listaller-installed 3rd-party applications from any software manager which supports PackageKit and/or AppStream.
At time it is discussed to run all installed 3rd-party tools in a Sandbox by default.
Programs that use Listaller must also be relocatable, meaning they must be installable to varying directories with a single binary. This makes it possible for Listaller to install software for non-root users into their home directory, although this method has to be enabled explicitly and its use is not encouraged.
The Listaller Developer Tools provide tools and documentation for application developers to make their software relocatable.
Listaller and Autopackage.
In August 2010 both projects announced they will merge. As consequence of the merge, Autopackage abandoned its own package binary package format and all user interfaces to install Autopackage packages.
Autopackage tools like BinReloc to create relocatable applications or APBuild are now developed as part of the Listaller project.
Reason for merging Autopackage into Listaller was mainly a great lack of developers in both projects so they decided to join forces.
Integration.
KDE provides support for Listaller through Apper, although distributors need to explicitly enable it using a compile-time switch. Support for GNOME is currently being developed as part of the GNOME-PackageKit suite.
In theory, any distribution which can run PackageKit >= 0.8.6 should be able to provide Listaller support too.
Ubuntu announced that they will not use Listaller as 3rd-party installer for their Ubuntu Phone, but develop an own, Ubuntu-specific solution instead.

Affine sphere

In mathematics, and especially differential geometry, an affine sphere is a hypersurface for which the affine normals all intersect in a single point. The term affine sphere is used because they play an analogous role in affine differential geometry to that of ordinary spheres in Euclidean differential geometry.
An affine sphere is called improper if all of the affine normals are constant. In that case, the intersection point mentioned above lies on the hyperplane at infinity.
Affine spheres have been the subject of much investigation, with many hundreds of research articles devoted to their study.

Ryson ST-100 Cloudster

The Ryson ST-100 Cloudster is a tandem two seat, low wing, conventional landing gear motor glider that was designed by T. Claude Ryan first flown in 1976 and certified in 1983. The aircraft was intended to be used as both a motor glider and a light aircraft and was type certified in both categories.
Design and development.
T. Claude Ryan had a long and illustrious career as an aerospace engineer, starting many storied companies, including Ryan Aeronautical Corporation and the Ryan Aeronautical Company. Late in his career, in 1969 he sold Ryan Aeronautical to Teledyne and it became Teledyne-Ryan, with Ryan remaining as "chairman emeritus". He started yet another company Ryson Aviation with his son, Jerome Ryan and designed a new aircraft designated the "ST-100" and named the Cloudster in honour of the Douglas Cloudster that he had purchased in 1925 and renamed the "Ryan Cloudster" at that time. Ladislao Pazmany is credited with contributions to the aircraft's design, as well.
The ST-100 was intended to be first and foremost a motor glider and second a light aircraft to be flown cross country under power. The aircraft is made with all-metal construction and features a wingspan. The wing has flaps with a range of -12 to +60° and a flap-aileron interconnect. The landing gear is conventional and features wheel pants. Power is supplied by a Continental O-200-A mounted in tractor configuration. The ST-100 has two batteries to ensure that the engine can be restarted in flight.
The prototype, registered N2RY, serial number 001, was completed in 1976. The type was certified on 29 July 1983 under separate type certificates for both FAR Part 23 and Part 26 as a light aircraft and also as a powered glider, for day visual flight rules flight only. The aircraft is also certified for aerobatics. Production was planned, but the elder Ryan died on 11 September 1982 at age 84 and no aircraft beyond the one prototype were produced. In March 2011 the prototype ST-100 was still owned by Ryson Aviation of San Diego.

Dobranje, Split-Dalmatia County

Dobranje is a village in Cista Provo municipality, Croatia.
Dobranje is located to the north of Imotska Krajina. The village is 570 meters above sea level. 
History.
The oldest document which mentions Dobranje is located in the archive of the Oriental Institute in Sarajevo and dates from 1585. Dobranje was probably populated before the Turkish invasion in the 15th century. When the Turks came the local population fled to various places. Later they returned and some newcomers also arrived. Since Dobranje was on the border of Ottoman Empire and the Venetian Republic there were many immigrants to the village. Major migrations happened when Turks expatriated Catholics from Herzegovina, especially in the time of the Morean War between Turks and Venetians (1684–1699) and the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718).

Shoot Many Robots

Shoot Many Robots is a downloadable video game developed by Demiurge Studios and published by Ubisoft for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Microsoft Windows via Steam. It is the first original title to be released by the developer previously known for its work on titles such as "Rock Band", "BioShock", "Mass Effect" and more. The game was released in March 2012 for XBLA and PSN, and a month later for Steam.
Gameplay.
"Shoot Many Robots" is an action platformer game. Players start in the character's RV, where they may equip their character with five items: one weapon that will have unlimited ammunition in the game, a special weapon with limited ammo, and hats, pants, and backpacks that can boost performance statistics such as damage given or health or impart special abilities such as slide attacks or a jetpack. They then select a stage to complete, generally following stages in a linear order, but players can return to a previously completed stage.
There are two types of stages. The most common requires the players to make their way through a level from start to finish, often ending on a final boss or a large rush of robots. Checkpoints are laid out through the course, so that if all players die, they will respawn at the last checkpoint passed. The other type of stage is a survival one, where players attempt to withstand several rounds of increasingly difficult enemies; as long as the player makes it through the first wave, they will have succeeded, but gain better rewards for lasting through bonus stages.
Players fight off robots by using their weapons, a melee attack, or any special attacks granted by their load-out. The robots have various offensive and defensive mechanism that the players must work around. Some will fire special slow-moving but powerful bullets that can only be stopped by melee attacking them back to the robot that fired them. Other robots are near impervious to attacks from one side, but are vulnerable to attacks from the opposite side. The player has a health meter that will drain when they are hit. If they take too much damage they will collapse; in multiplayer games, another player can revive them, otherwise they will start back at the last checkpoint. The player begins a level with a number of bottles of beer that can be taken to restore health.
Robots will drop nuts on dying; this is the game's currency which can be used to buy new equipment. Sometimes robots or special boxes will drop crates that contain tickets with which to purchase new equipment, or a large quantity of nuts. These rewards are tied to a player and can only be picked up by that player. Additionally, power-ups may be dropped by the robots, some giving temporary boosts like extra speed or attack damage, while others restore beer or special ammo. Killing each robot also boosts the player's experience level, which affects what equipment the player will have access to. 
After completing a level, the players are rated on a star-based scoring system based on the number of nuts collected. To boost their score, players can chain robot kills together to increase a scoring multiplier up to 5x, though players must continue to kill robots to maintain this. The total cumulative stars that a player has earned will influence which levels the player has access too. Players are rewarded with additional nuts based on their relative performance. Once back in the RV, the players can then proceed to use the nuts to purchase equipment that they have obtained a ticket for and within their experience level.
The game supports co-operative play between two and four players. Individual player characters are identified by unique color to distinguish them from others.
Reception.
"Shoot Many Robots" was released to mixed reviews and currently holds a 69/100 on review aggregate site Metacritic. GamesBeat gave it 78 points out of 100, saying, "As team-carnage games go, you'll get some mileage out of this one. Grab a few of your drinkin' buddies, and have yourselves a fun (and cheap) night of gratuitous hillbilly firepower and richly deserved robo-death. Preferably with your beer goggles on."

The Cape Race

The Cape Race are a five-piece British rock band from Manchester, England. They formed in September 2009.
Formation & "Now, Voyager" (2009-2012).
The band were revealed in November 2009 with a 4-track self-recorded demo and a short tour of the North of England with former labelmates Lost On Landing and Rob Lynch. They spent the majority of 2010 writing for their debut release, and were seen live across the country with the likes of The Cribs, Badly Drawn Boy, The 1975, Liam Frost, Parachute, Futures, Tellison, Don Broco, The Dangerous Summer, Fireworks, Make Do and Mend, Tiger Please, Yuck, Blitz Kids, Francesqa, and Pegasus Bridge.
In October 2010 the band entered Earth Terminal Studios to record their debut mini-album "Now, Voyager" with producer Peter Miles. On 27 December the band announced the record via a video on their official website and plans to make a promotional video for every single track on the record.
The first single from the record, ""They're Young, They're In Love"" was released on 1 January 2011 to generous critical acclaim online, and also earnt the band a spotlight feature on popular music site AbsolutePunk.net. The second single, ""Little Whites"" was released on 4 April 2011.
On 1 June 2011, the band launched the release campaign for the full mini-album "Now, Voyager". It was offered as a free download from thecaperace.com/nowvoyager a little over a month ahead of its release on 4 July. As it started to hit email inboxes at midnight (GMT) on 4 July, the record had seen in excess of 10,000 pre-orders.
The band announced a third single & video for "The Reprieve" shortly afterwards. The music video premiered exclusively at Rock Sound on 13 July.
Digging For Gold and other singles (2012-2013).
The band began to tease what appeared to be artwork for their first new music following 'Now, Voyager" in January 2013 via their Instagram account. On 19 February 2013, the single ""Digging For Gold"" was released. The band premiered a music video for another new single, "Home Truths", with Rock Sound magazine. 
Home, Truths (debut full-length) (2014-present).
The band recorded their debut album at Middle Farm Studios with producer Peter Miles (Dry The River, The King Blues, We Are the Ocean, Canterbury). The record will be released in August 2014. The band have confirmed that the album will include the singles released through 2013 and earlier.
Member history & formation.
The members of The Cape Race came together from being part of different bands in the Manchester scene. David and Jonny were respectively singing and drumming in a band called No Standards when they played a show with a band called Grayson's Hour. Playing in Grayson's Hour at the time was Scott Perkins, as well as Joe Lennox and Adam Morris, who between the five of them formed a new band called The Honeymoon Suite in 2006. The Honeymoon Suite self-released the ""The Matrimony EP"" later that year, and quickly made quite a name for themselves by winning an Ernie Ball Battle Of The Bands competition to open the Taste of Chaos tour with Taking Back Sunday, Anti-Flag, Underoath, Alexisonfire, Senses Fail, Saosin and Cancer Bats. Adam Morris left the band in 2008 and was replaced by Matt Sayward. The band signed with LAB Records (Hellogoodbye, The Morning Of, Just Surrender, The Summer Set) and recorded a sophomore release ""Calm Your Little Passions"" at Stakeout Studios with producer Jason Wilson. The band were seen on the live circuit all over the UK with the likes of You Me At Six, Kids In Glass Houses, A Day To Remember, The Blackout, The Hold Steady, We Are The Ocean, Spitalfield, This Providence, Young Guns and Canterbury before splitting in 2009 and forming The Cape Race to pursue a different creative direction. Matt had met Adam as a guitar player in 2004 and asked him to come on board as bassist.

5-simplex honeycomb

In five-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the 5-simplex honeycomb or hexateric honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb or pentacomb). Each vertex is shared by 12 5-simplexes, 30 rectified 5-simplexes, and 20 birectified 5-simplexes. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.
A5 lattice.
This vertex arrangement is called the A5 lattice or 5-simplex lattice. The 30 vertices of the stericated 5-simplex vertex figure represent the 30 roots of the formula_1 Coxeter group. It is the 5-dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb.
The A lattice can be constructed as the union of two A5 lattices:
The A is the union of three A5 lattices: 
The A lattice (also called A) is the union of six A5 lattices, and is the dual vertex arrangement to the omnitruncated 5-simplex honeycomb, and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 5-simplex.
Projection by folding.
The "5-simplex honeycomb" can be projected into the 3-dimensional cubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement:

Smoke Ring for My Halo

Smoke Ring for My Halo is the fourth studio album by American indie rock musician Kurt Vile, released on March 8, 2011 on Matador Records. A deluxe edition was released in November 2011, including the subsequent EP, "So Outta Reach" (2011). The album was produced by John Agnello, Kurt Vile and his backing band, the Violators. Regarding the album's lyrical content, Vile stated: "It’s just me and those thoughts you have late at night when nobody is around. It is more a feeling than a statement – a general wandering feeling. It’s kind of a wandering record."
The album was released to critical acclaim upon its release, with "Mojo" placing the album at #12 on its "Top 50 albums of 2011" list, while "Uncut" placed the album at number 14 and 
"Pitchfork" placed the album at number 16.
Background and recording.
Following the release of "Childish Prodigy" (2009), Vile and his backing band, the Violators, embarked upon an extensive tour, with Vile stating, "There has been a lot of touring and more growing – more than people might know." The tour was the first to feature the full Violators line-up, with Vile noting, "was the first time the full band could come along. We had kind of a shitty rental van and it was the first time we were all together for that long. At points it was like "Lord of the Flies", everyone ready to eat each other up, and then we’re suddenly like best friends again. And we still are best friends."
The band subsequently entered the studio with producer John Agnello. Comparing "Smoke Ring for Halo"'s sessions to his previous studio album, Vile stated, "With "Childish Prodigy", I had made a whole record not knowing where I was going – it was me in my studio, somewhere between lo-fi and, maybe not super, hi-fi. [...] I wanted to have a concept of this album being a statement as a whole, as opposed a little bit from here and a little bit from there. It shows a kind of introspective folk side more, while still being into rock. It doesn't capture my whole sound, but it captures part of my sound and is more concise as a record."
During the album's initial recording sessions, Vile attempted to record "kind of trance-like, Appalachian folk-style songs [...] and at the time it was too rushed, and I still hadn't nailed it. I attempted to get these tunes down, but they aren't ready yet." The final two songs to be recorded for the album were "Society Is My Friend and "Puppet to the Man", with Vile stating: "Matador did say, 'It’s great, but there aren’t any rockers on it.' So I back in and recorded a couple rockers, which I’m glad I did. “Society Is My Friend” and “Puppet to the Man” — I recorded them at the end."
Reflecting upon the album in 2013, Vile stated, "I proved myself with "Smoke Ring". It was me maturing. I made a good pop record. And all the songs were me, but that was like a growing record. Growing in a lot of ways. But it didn't feel exactly me. I wasn't entirely comfortable or experienced with the scenario, and I feel that album, "Wakin on a Pretty Daze" is just 100% my voice all the time."
Writing and composition.
Much of the album's material was written on an acoustic guitar, with Vile stating, "I bought a new Martin guitar at the time and I was using at home to get ready to record and it came out real acoustic."
Regarding the religious connotations of the album's second track, "Jesus Fever", Vile stated, "My family was religious – I am not particularly practicing religion myself but I was definitely exposed to it. They were super-religious but not like over-the-top to the point it turns negative. But, it is also kind of a gospel thing – back to old music. The Rolling Stones and Spacemen 3 tap into that religious thing really well, as it is kind of a blues-gospel thing. So, it is a combination of coming from a religious family and that musical lineage."
"Ghost Town" was previously released as "Sad Ghost," a B-side on the single release of "In My Time." The song "Runner Ups" contains some of the same lyrics as the song "Red Apples" from the album, "God Is Saying This to You..." (2009).

Ikhwan raids on Transjordan

Ikhwan raids on Transjordan were a series of plunders by the Ikhwan, irregular Arab tribesmen of Najd, on Transjordan between 1922 and 1924. The repeated Wahhabi incursions from Najd into southern parts of his territory were the most serious threat to emir Abdullah's position in Transjordan. The emir was powerless to repel those raids by himself, thus the British maintained a military base, with a small air force, at Marka, close to Amman. The British military force was the primary obstacle against the Ikhwan, helping emir Abdullah to secure his rule over Transjordan.
Background.
With the defeat of the Hashemites in the Nejd-Hejaz War of 1919, and a failture to establish a Hashemite domain over greater Syria, the British hoped to secure Transjordan and Iraq as client Hashemite Kingdoms, and did put a significant effort to secure them from external and internal threats. The military assistance of the British to emir Abdullah of Transjordan was used to help with the suppression of local rebellions at Kura and later by Sultan Adwan, in 1921 and 1923 respectively. They also played a crucial role in the major invasions by the Wahhabi tribesmen of Nejd (the Ikhwan).
First major raid.
The Ikhwan initiated their first long range raid on Amman, with participation of some 1,500 camel raiders. According to Guckian, the raiders dissipated upon spotting a British aircraft approaching their column, and never reached Amman. On the other hand, Wilson and Graham claim the intent of the raid was two small villages, which were entirely massacred, and the raiding Ikhwan party was intercepted by British armored cars and planes on their way back to the Kingdom.
Second major raid.
In August 1924, a larger Ikhwan militia force, numbering some 4,500 raiders, travelled 1,600 kilometers from Najd (in modern day Saudi Arabia) to attack Transjordan, which was at that time under British protectorate. Just 15 kilometers off Amman, the raiders were spotted by the British RAF, which in turn attacked the Ikhwan using airplanes. The Ikhwan army suffered heavy casualties, with death toll reaching 500. Without the help of the RAF, Amman would most likely been captured by the Ikhwans.
Aftermath.
Other raids of Ikhwan occurred during the 1927-1930 Ikhwan Revolt against the authority of Ibn Saud. The Ikhwanis raided on southern Iraq in November 1927, and on Kuwait in January 1928, in which they looted camels and sheep. On both occasions, though they raided brutally, they suffered heavy retaliations from RAF and Kuwaitis. The Ikhwan were eventually defeated by Ibn Saud's regular forces and their leadership slain. The remants were incorporated into regular Saudi units.

<doc id="31202465" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31202465" title="Cudjoe">
Cudjoe

Cudjoe, or Captain Cudjoe (c. 1680 – 1744), sometimes spelled Cudjo - corresponding to the Akan day name Kojo or Kwadwo - was a Maroon leader in Jamaica, and the brother of Nanny of the Maroons. He has been described as "the greatest of the Maroon leaders."
The Jamaican Maroons are descended from runaway slaves who established free communities in the mountains of Jamaica during the long era of slavery in the island. African slaves imported during the Spanish period may have provided the first runaways, apparently mixing with the Native American Taino or Arawak people that remained in the country. Some may have gained liberty when the English attacked Jamaica and took it in 1655, and subsequently. For about 52 years, until the 1737 peace treaty with the British rulers of the island - which is still in force - the Maroons stubbornly resisted conquest.
Biographical information.
Cudjoe is believed (according to Maroon oral tradition) to have been the son of Naquan, a chief of the Akan people or Coromantee people from what is modern-day Ghana. Naquan was taken captive and sold into slavery in Spanish Jamaica in the 1640s but he initiated a revolt and led his tribesmen into the mountainous interior of the island, establishing the first community of Maroons, as the runaway slaves were called, after the Spanish word "cimarron", meaning "wild".
The two main Maroon groups in the 18th century were the Leeward and the Windward tribes, the former led by Cudjoe in Trelawny Town and the latter led by his sister Queen Nanny (and later by Quao). Captain Cudjoe had endless energy and was greatly motivated to stay a free man. He was strong, courageous and relentless. Cudjoe was also a very skilful, tactical field commander and a remarkable leader.
Battles with the British.
When the British attempted to recapture runaways, Cudjoe defeated them on every occasion. Not only did Cudjoe successfully defend his communities, but also, similar to what Harriet Tubman would do in the nineteenth century, he freed many captives by raiding Britain’s plantations. Sometimes his raids were non-confrontational, but most times they were vicious, bloody encounters.
Before he attacked a plantation, Cudjoe would send spies among the captives to gather information from them at the markets and on the plantations. Once his spies collected sufficient evidence of the slave-owners’ plans, they sent them to Cudjoe. Then he determined the time and place of his attacks. During his strikes, Cudjoe and his men burned down mansions, destroyed cane fields and killed many whites along with faithful slaves who refused to help him.
Cudjoe’s attacks were so devastating that many of the early English settlers abandoned their plantations and returned to England. He often killed faithful slaves during these attacks because he despised them. According to one of England’s commanders on the island, General Williamson, it was commonly said, "the British rules Jamaica by day and Captain Cudjoe by night."
In an attempt to capture Cudjoe and the Maroons, British leaders built forts near Maroon communities. They imported Native American tracking specialists from Central America to hunt down the Maroons. In addition, they formed an army of more than 1,000 soldiers to fight Cudjoe’s weapon-deficient military.
However, even with the tracking specialists and formidable army, Cudjoe outmaneuvered the British commander when one of Cudjoe’s spies told the commander that Cudjoe established settlements in a particular valley. As the British soldiers marched into the valley, Cudjoe’s four-sectioned forces watched them from behind the natural boundaries. When Cudjoe’s men attacked the soldiers from all sides, the crossfire surprised and debilitated them. The British soldiers fled the area and left behind guns and supplies.
For the next decade, Cudjoe caused considerable damage to the slave structure of Jamaica. When he raided, he often burned sugar cane fields, houses and barns, and he continued to kill slaves who were loyal to their masters. This latter measure put a great deal of pressure on every African captive to abide by Cudjoe’s advances. Therefore, Cudjoe’s peer-pressure tactic led the British to distrust just about every captive on the island.
To finally stop Cudjoe, the British government planned an elaborate expedition against the Maroons. The British recruited every fighting-eligible man on the island to move against Cudjoe. However, after considering the fact that if all the men went to fight against the Maroons, there would be no one left to protect the women and children, the British had a serious dilemma and they did not know what to do.
Faced with a very disturbing problem, Governor Sir Edward Trelawney weighed the possibilities. Eventually, he decided not to attack Cudjoe. He, instead, opted to make a treaty of peace with the Maroons. To carry out Governor Trelawney’s orders, a rather large army escorted Colonel Guthrie to meet with Cudjoe in Maroon territory. Once he convinced Cudjoe and his men that he would neither attack nor trick them, Cudjoe met with the colonel.
After talking for an hour or so, both men worked out a satisfactory treaty. They agreed that the British must recognize the Maroons as an independent nation; that the Maroons receive a very large tract of land and would not have to pay any taxes on it. However, Chief Cudjoe, in return for this recognition of autonomy, promised to return runaway slaves and help put down future slave rebellions. Maroon societies still exist in Jamaica today.
Cudjoe died at Nanny town in the Blue Mountains five years after peace was concluded. He was succeeded by his brother, Accompong.
Legacy.
Milton McFarlane, a descendant of Cudjoe, has written that it probably would have taken the British abolitionsts "twice as long abolish slavery had it not been for the Maroon victory that gave the British cause to think. 
Cudjoe Day is celebrated in Jamaica on the first Monday in January.

Society for the History of Natural History

The Society for the History of Natural History (SHNH) is a friendly international society for everyone who is interested in natural history in the broadest sense. This includes botany, zoology and geology as well as natural history collections, exploration, art and bibliography. Everyone with an interest in these subjects – professional or amateur – is welcome to join. The Society's Patron is Sir David Attenborough OM CH FRS.
Originally named the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History, SHNH was founded in 1936 by a small group of distinguished scientists, librarians and bibliographers whose appreciation and love of books inspired the formation of the Society in London. The Society's first President was Charles Davies Sherborn (1861–1942), who compiled the "Index Animalium" single-handedly over 43 years (1758–1850). This 11 volume, 9,000 page work became the basis for zoological nomenclature. 
The Society's main publication is "Archives of natural history" which is published for the Society by Edinburgh University Press. "Archives of natural history" provides an avenue for the publication of papers on the history and bibliography of natural history in its broadest sense, and in all periods and all cultures. This includes botany, geology, palaeontology and zoology, the lives of naturalists, their publications, correspondence and collections, and the institutions and societies to which they belong. Bibliographical papers concerned with the study of rare books, manuscripts and illustrative material, and analytical and enumerative bibliographies are also published. From time to time, the Society also publishes other works of interest, the most recent being "Darwin in the Archives". An informal "Newsletter" is also produced. 
The Society holds a regular series of meetings on all aspects of the history of natural history. These range from short evening meetings to international conferences taking place over several days with associated visits. It holds an annual "Spring Meeting" incorporating the Annual General Meeting at which Officers of the Society are elected, accounts presented, and medals and awards are announced. Every alternate year this becomes an international conference usually in the form of a one- or two-day symposium on a selected theme. Our meetings are seen as an important contribution to forging links between all those working in the history of natural history, leading to lasting collaborations and friendships across national and international boundaries.
Medals and prizes.
The Society seeks to promote the objectives for which it was founded by making awards for excellence in areas of its fields of activity. 
The following medals and prizes are awarded by the Society for the History of Natural History:

The Henry Lischer House is an historic home located in the Hamburg Historic District in Davenport, Iowa, United States. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The house was individually listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1993. The Italian Villa style home was designed by Davenport architect Frederick Clausen. Frederick Clausen was married to Henry Lischers daughter Johanna. 
Henry Lischer.
The home is associated with Henry Lischer, the owner and publisher of one of Davenport’s German-language newspapers "Der Demokrat". The paper was founded by Theodor Gülich in November 1851. Lischer and his partner, Theodor Olshausen, bought the paper in 1856. Both were German immigrants who became newspapermen in St. Louis, Missouri. At its inception the paper was aligned with the political philosophy, and financial support, of the Democratic Party. However, it was a “free paper” that was not beholden to party doctrines and supported the right of freedom and human rights. It began to support the positions of the Republican Party. It was opposed to slavery and printed a supportive obituary to abolitionist John Brown. Lischer and Olshausen left Davenport in 1860 to return to St. Louis where they took over the "Westliche Post". The new owners of "Der Demokrat" experienced financial problems as a result of their radical views and the economic downturn as a result of the American Civil War. Lischer, who still had a financial interest in the paper, returned to Davenport and became its sole owner for the next 40 years. After the Civil War editorials in the paper fought the prohibition of alcohol, which was supported by the Republican Party. Even after the state of Iowa successfully passed prohibition laws in 1882, Scott County remained defiant with the support of the paper. Lischer’s sons continued their father’s work after his death.

An ambulatist is a licensed health care provider who specializes in the prevention, management, and care coordination of ambulatory patients with chronic diseases by using lifestyle medicine and drug therapy.
History.
Nearly half of all Americans live with at least one chronic condition and ~70% of all American deaths can be attributed directly to chronic diseases. Care coordination is necessary to curb the progression and cost associated with chronic disease in The United States.
The ambulatist model of care coordination began in 2008 at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. The Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Prog ram (CVRRP) and Diabetes Risk Reduction Program (DMRRP) are employee wellness benefit programs for Creighton employees with the diagnoses of hypertension, dyslipidemia and/or diabetes. The programs are run by a health care specialty position called the "ambulatist". An ambulatist can be any licensed health care provider who receives training in direct patient care and lifestyle medicine. The areas of lifestyle medicine emphasized can include physical activity, nutrition, weight control, stress management, sleep success and tobacco cessation. Creighton University is now developing an ambulatist training program to expand the use of ambulatist services across a variety of practice settings.

Marianne du Toit

Marianne du Toit (born 1970) is a South African adventurer and photographer, notable for her epic journey on horseback and foot from Argentina to New York over a period of 21 months.
After graduating from Stellenbosch University in 1992 with a BA degree in political science and psychology, she spent three years exploring and cycling through Europe before finally settling in Dublin, where she currently lives.
Inspired by the Swiss adventurer Aimé Félix Tschiffely, who from 1925 to 1928 traveled from Buenos Aires to Washington DC with two Criollo horses, Marianne resolved to follow in his footsteps. She decided to use the journey to promote and raise money in support of therapeutic riding facilities in Ireland.
"“I remember, since I was about 17 I would always read these articles about independent daring women who had done these amazing journeys. There was always something deep down driving me to these adventurous things. I just loved the adrenaline and the excitement.”"
She spoke no Spanish and knew little about horses and horse riding, but set off in May 2002 from Ireland for South America where her two Criollo’s, Mise and Tusa, were acquired. Their names mean respectively Me and You in the Irish language. Six months into her journey, Tusa was found to be suffering from anaemia and had to be put down. Marianne considered admitting defeat; however despite numerous other hardships she persevered and completed the journey, joining in the St Patrick’s Day parade through the streets of New York in 2004. Marianne's adventures are related in her book "Crying with Cockroaches".
Supporting the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Marianne rescues stray dogs from Dublin streets. The foie gras industry, factory farming, testing on animals, the fur trade and use of animals in the circus are some of the issues she chooses to highlight.

Conspirator (1949 film)

Conspirator is a 1949 British thriller film directed by Victor Saville and starring Robert Taylor and Elizabeth Taylor. Based on the 1948 novel "Conspirator" by Humphrey Slater, the film is about a beautiful eighteen-year-old American woman who meets and falls in love with a British Guards officer who turns out to be a spy for the Soviet Union. After they are married, she discovers his true identity and forces him to choose between his marriage and his ideology. When his Soviet handlers order him to murder his young American wife, he is faced with the ultimate choice. "Conspirator" was made for distribution by MGM. 
The film created some controversy over the age difference between Robert Taylor, who was in his late thirties, and Elizabeth Taylor, who was only sixteen at the time of production. The producers were careful to cut mentions in the film of British traitors during the Second World War, such as John Amery and Norman Baillie-Stewart, out of fear of litigation by their families. An indirect mention of Baillie-Stewart remained in the film, however, with him being referred to not by name, but simply as "that fellow in the Tower". The plot of the film also bore some similarities to the later case of the Cambridge Spies, including Donald MacLean.
Reception.
According to MGM records the film earned $859,000 in the US and Canada and $732,000 overseas, resulting in a loss to the studio of $804,000.

Dr. Heinrich Matthey House

The Dr. Heinrich Matthey House is an historic home located in the Hamburg Historic District in Davenport, Iowa, United States. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The house was individually listed on the Davenport Register of Historic Properties in 1993. The Georgian Revival home features a rectangular form, a high hipped roof, a Palladian window in the dormer, a symmetrical front with the entrance on the right and a columned porch. On the east side of house is a projecting window bay and a tower on the southeast corner of the house that are reminiscent of the Queen Anne style.
Dr. Heinrich Matthey.
The home is associated with Davenport physician Heinrich Matthey. He and his twin brother Carl were born on October 20, 1852 to Heinrich and Emilie (Kuntz) Matthey in Prussia. When he was 21, Heinrich immigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin with his parents in 1873. They moved to Davenport three years later. He joined his father in publishing the "Sternan Banner". In 1880 he moved to Sterling, Illinois where he published the "Sterling Beobachter". After two years he sold the paper and returned to Germany where he studied medicine in Leipzig and Würzburg, graduating in 1887. His brother Carl, who had stayed in Germany to study medicine, moved to Davenport and set up his medical practice. Heinrich returned to Davenport upon the completion of his studies and set up his practice. The two brothers merged their practices in 1889. The following year Heinrich married Hilda Mueller, daughter of lumber baron Chris Mueller, and they raised two children. Heinrich spent two terms on the school board.

Eusebio Ríos

Eusebio Ríos Fernández (30 March 1935 – 10 May 2008) was a Spanish football defender and manager.
Playing career.
Born in Portugalete, Biscay, Ríos started his career in his native Basque Country, representing two teams. In 1958 he moved to Andalusia after signing with Real Betis, going on to play in 11 seasons with the club (ten in La Liga) before retiring in 1968 at 33 years of age; his debut in the top flight occurred on 21 September 1958 in a 4–2 win against Sevilla FC, in what was the first official match played at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium.
Ríos gained one cap for Spain, playing the second half of a 1–2 friendly loss with Portugal in Porto, on 15 November 1964.
Manager career.
Ríos began coaching in 1970, shortly after retiring.

LAUNCH Conference

The LAUNCH Conference was created by Jason Calacanis. Although it is legally unrelated to the TechCrunch40 and TechCrunch50 events, it has been perceived as the natural evolution of those events citing Calacanis' involvement, and then split, from Michael Arrington and the TechCrunch series of events. The premise of the Launch Conference was to create the "most affordable, high-end technology event in the world.".
2011 Conference.
The 2011 conference took place on February 23–24 at the San Francisco Design Center. 500 companies applied, only 54 presented on stage, 13 prizes were awarded.
1.0 Competition.
This competition was created for completely new companies that had never had any press, public demos and whose services are currently in closed alpha or beta. Companies applying to be in the 1.0 Competition were required to take down any web presence, ensure that they were not included in press or public notices of any kind, and keep their presence in the competition private until they took the stage to present. 
Winners 
2.0 Competition.
This competition was created for existing companies that were launching new products, or significant new versions of an existing product. Examples provided by the conference for 2.0 qualifications included Google launching a completely new social network, or Twitter launching a completely new interface. 
Winners 
The LAUNCHPAD Competition.
The LAUNCHPAD companies were selected from over 80 participants that were invited to the conference by Calacanis on his "This Week in Startups" podcast, such as TripBod, or through competitions run on both Quora and HackerNews. In addition, companies could pay $1500 to have a table in the LAUNCHPAD. The method of entry (invite or paid) did not affect the selection criteria by the grand jury when LAUNCHPAD companies were selected to join on stage. 
From the LAUNCHPAD
Grand Jury.
The Grand Jury selected the Launch competition winners, and were required to watch all presentations as well as walk the LaunchPad floor to select participants to join on stage. 
The 2011 Grand Jury was made up of: 
TechCrunch controversy.
The initial Launch conference did have a minor controversy. TechCrunch refused to cover the event. Based on its self-description of their mission, "to obsessively profiling startups, reviewing new Internet products, and breaking tech news", the lack of attendance was seen as a disappointment to attendees of the show.
While TechCrunch did not have anyone in attendance, several startups and competitors were profiled in TechCrunch during the conference, although the associated articles made no mention of the Launch conference. The first presentation of the conference, Careers 2.0, was profiled without mention of the conference.

Speedball (art products)

Speedball is an American company that manufactures art materials and other stationery items. The company, first successful with its dip pens, expanded its product line to other art areas such as painting, sculpture and printing press.
History.
In 1899, C. Howard Hunt formed his own company and established it in Camden, New Jersey. The Speedball pen was developed and patented by sign letterer Ross Frederic George (1889-1959) of Seattle. The original pen's "A-style nib" developed by Ross had a square-tipped head that made broad clunky lines, but it worked well for some of Ross's numerous lettering styles. The "B-style Nib" had a Round Section at the head of the nib that would round off the beginning and the ending of the letters. The "C-style Nib" is the Chisel-point nib that creates thick and thin lines depending on the angle the pen is held. The C-style nibs are a favorite of many calligraphers. The "D-style Nib" is the Oval Shaped Head nib that creates an Italic/Gothic style to the letters that it produces. All of these styles have Ross' signature Brass Reservoir. The E-style Nib is the Steel Brush. George took the patent to the C. Howard Hunt Pen Company in 1915. They manufactured each of the above nibs in different sizes and published the "Speedball Text Book", a periodical manual written by Ross F.George which contained updated samples of numerous lettering artists work, including Ross's past instructor William Hugh Gordon. 
After Ross's death, there have only been a few updates of the Speedball Text Book published.
Speedball Division also fitted some of the B-style nibs with an openable reservoir so the artist could clean them a little better. They called these nibs the FB-style, or Flicker.
The "Steel Brushes" were made in four sizes, also Chisel Pointed, but in larger sizes than the C-Style nibs. The Steel Brushes also fit in the same size Nib Holders that are used for the smaller nibs. 
A new chapter to the history of Speedball began November 14, 1997, when CEO Walt Glazer led a buyout of the Speedball division during Hunt Corporation’s restructuring. Subsequently, Hunt pens are currently commercialized under the Speedball brand.

Nibs.
Speedball makes nibs for dip pens in a variety of sizes. The sizes for their C-series flat-tipped pens (such as for Italic writing) are given below:
Artists.
Speedball and Hunt pens have been widely used by a legion of comic strip and comic book artists to ink their pages. Hunt pens were the choice of Walt Simonson, Dale Keown, Bob McLeod, Kevin Nowlan, Bill Sienkiewicz, Joe Sinnott, Mark Morales and Andy Lanning (#102 model), George Pérez (#100), Mike DeCarlo (#103), Drew Geraci (#22) and Joe Rubinstein (#100, 103). Carl Barks' wife lettered his comics with a Speedball A-5 or B-6, although Barks himself was an Esterbrook enthusiastic.

Gregory Jaczko

Gregory B. Jaczko (; born October 29, 1970, Norristown, Pennsylvania) was a Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). On May 21, 2012, he announced his resignation pending the confirmation of the next person to fill this role. On July 9, 2012, Jaczko was replaced by Allison Macfarlane, a nuclear waste expert and associate professor at George Mason University.
Early life and education.
Jaczko was raised in Albany, New York. He studied physics and philosophy at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and earned a bachelor in the two disciplines there in 1993. He also earned a doctorate in theoretical particle physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in 1999. He is married to journalist Leigh Ann Caldwell.
Political career.
He served as a Congressional Science Fellow in the office of U.S. Representative Ed Markey in Washington, D.C. on the basis of an AAAS "Science and Technology Policy Fellowship". He also worked as an adjunct professor for Physics and Public Policy under Dr. Francis Slakey at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. 
He later advised the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on issues regarding nuclear power, and served as appropriations director for U.S. Senator Harry Reid and as Reid's science policy advisor.
Jaczko was first sworn in as a Commissioner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on January 21, 2005. On May 13, 2009, President Obama designated him the organization's Chairman, i.e. its principal executive officer and official spokesperson. Jaczko is responsible for long-range planning as well as budgetary and certain personnel functions of the NRC. “He also has authority for all NRC functions pertaining to a potential emergency involving an NRC licensee”.
Policy positions.
Jaczko has asserted that the greatest possible openness furthers the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's work on the protection of the environment and of public health and safety. He encourages “licensees, vendors, state and local governments, interest groups, and the general public” to participate in the Commission's policy-making efforts. Efforts by Jaczko to strengthen security regulations for nuclear power plants have included requiring new such plants to be able to withstand an aircraft crash.
On February 9, 2012 Jaczko cast the lone dissenting vote on plans to build the first new nuclear power plant in more than 30 years when the NRC voted 4-1 to allow Atlanta-based Southern Co to build and operate two new nuclear power reactors at its existing Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. He cited safety concerns stemming from Japan's 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying "I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened".
Management style.
A report by Nuclear Regulatory Commission Inspector General Hubert T. Bell accused Jaczko of "strategically" withholding information from his colleagues in an effort to keep plans for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository from advancing. The report also stated that he "controls information provided to other commissioners based on his interpretation of his statutory authority versus the authority given to the Commission" and that as a result, commissioners "are uncertain as to whether they are adequately informed of policy matters that should be brought to their attention."
In October 2011, all the other four NRC commissioners—two Democrats and two Republicans—sent a letter to the White House expressing "grave concern" about Jaczko's actions at the NRC. On December 14, 2011, Commissioner William Ostendorff, a Republican, told a House oversight committee that Jaczko's "bullying and intimidation... should not and cannot be tolerated." 
A report by Congressional Republicans detailed incidents indicating what House Republicans called Jaczko's "propensity for angry outbursts and aggressive behavior." A 2012 NRC Office of Inspector General report cleared him of such allegations. 
Top House Republicans called on President Obama to dismiss Jaczko. Jaczko said problems at the agency were not his fault but instead stem from "lack of understanding" on the part of others. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid defended Jaczko, saying his critics are attacking him because "they’re concerned about the nuclear industry. He’s concerned about the American people."
Peter A. Bradford, who was a commission member from 1977 to 1982, has defended Jaczko. Bradford said it was not unusual for the commissioners to disagree strongly, and added that he did not believe that "the chairman is somehow raging around the agency and intimidating the staff". He also argued that, although the letter came from two Republicans and two Democrats, it was necessarily bi-partisan in the context of nuclear politics. He claimed that "In Washington, you’ve got a situation where the ‘nuclear party’ transcends the Republican and Democratic party," adding that "You’ve got four members of the nuclear party writing a letter about the chairman, who’s never been a member of the nuclear party."
Jaczko resigned in May of 2012. He was succeeded by Allison Macfarlane.

Thomas P. Barnett

Thomas P. Barnett (February 11, 1870 – September 23, 1929), also known professionally as Tom Barnett and Tom P. Barnett, was an American architect and painter from St. Louis, Missouri. Barnett was nationally recognized for both his work in architecture and in painting.
Architectural work.
Barnett trained under his father, St. Louis architect George I. Barnett, who was known for designing public landmarks such as the renovation of the Old Courthouse, the Missouri Governor's Mansion, and the structures of the Missouri Botanical Garden. 
After graduating Saint Louis University in 1886, Tom Barnett joined with his brother and brother-in-law, George Dennis Barnett and John Ignatius Haynes, to form the architectural firm Barnett, Haynes & Barnett. The firm continued the traditional motifs of the elder George Barnett. The combined legacy of two generations of Barnett designs were largely responsible for Classicism being the dominate architectural influence in St. Louis. 
In 1904, Barnett served on the Commission of Architects for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (better known as the St. Louis World's Fair) and personally designed the Palace of Liberal Arts for which he earned the fair's "Gold Medal for Architecture". The following year, he would win the "Bronze Medal for Architecture" at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon.
Other projects designed by Barnett included commercial buildings, residential (including private places), and a significant number of religious structures. Surviving examples include the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, Texas, and the Saint Clement Catholic Church in Chicago.
Painting.
Later in life, Barnett turned his attentions primarily to painting. He studied under Paul Cornoyer, and followed the American Impressionism style. Barnett characteristically used wide brush strokes and vibrant colors. His works typically idealized his subjects, and were emotionally expressive and optimistic. 
Barnett's paintings were well received in his lifetime. His works were exhibited at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in New York, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and with regularity at the Saint Louis Art Museum. Barnett won both local and national awards including the "Bronze Medal for Painting" at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in 1905, and the "First Ives Landscape Prize" from the St. Louis Artist's Guild every year between 1914 and 1925. 
In 1922, Barnett painted the 12' by 6' mural, "Riches of the Mines", in the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City. The lunette representing a zinc mine in southwest Missouri was a favorite of art critics who marveled at Barnett's ability to depict drama and beauty in an otherwise bleak and desolate scene. 
Barnett was a mem­ber of the Chi­cago Art Guild, National Arts Club, St. Louis Artist's Guild, Salmagundi Club, Chi­cago Gal­le­ries As­so­cia­tion, Al­lied Ar­tists of Ame­rica, and the American Federation of Arts.
Works by Barnett are held in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Saint Louis Art Museum, the art collection of the Missouri State Capitol, the Missouri History Museum, the Museum of Art and Archaeology at the University of Missouri, and the Busch family collection housed at Grant's Farm.

Tux Games

Tux Games is one of the first still active online Linux game retailers, founded on January 1, 2000 by Michael Simms, who would later also found Linux Game Publishing. It was originally created in response to Simms being unable to order a version of Loki Software's port of "" from any British reseller.
Tux Games, being one of the oldest retailers, is one of the few places still selling Loki Software stock, although their availability is still variable. It also offered the unique service of selling Linux boxed copies of many games whose ports otherwise require the presence of a Windows boxed version, such as with several id Software products. Doing this had the advantage of guaranteeing it is counted as a Linux sale.
In addition to its services as a games seller, Tux Games has attempted to branch out into other areas, such as selling gaming oriented computer systems, and attempting to open a Donation Center for free software projects. In the end neither of these appear to have been successful. Its decision of hosting old Loki Software demos has been met with praise however.
Tux Games received many requests for sales statistics, which prompted Simms to add a sales information chart to the main website. The current top five overall sellers are "Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri", "Tribes 2," "Return to Castle Wolfenstein", "Neverwinter Nights", and "Majesty Gold".
In recent years Tux Games has gained some competition from other similarly focused retailers, such as Fun4Tux and Wupra, both retailers based in continental Europe. It is also competing with the online digital distribution services Gameolith and Desura. It has also been occasionally criticized for poor order handling.
On January 31, 2012 after over a decade with the company, Michael Simms announced he was stepping down as CEO and handing over control to Clive Crous.

Charles Stetson Wheeler

Charles Stetson Wheeler (December 12, 1863 – April 27, 1923) was an American attorney, working in Northern California. He served as a Regent of the University of California, and was a member of the Committee of Fifty working to maintain order after the devastating fire following the earthquake of 1906 in San Francisco. Wheeler was active in Republican Party politics.
Early career.
Wheeler was born in Oakland, California, on December 12, 1863. His parents were Charles C. Wheeler from Norridgewock, Maine, and the former Angelina (or Angeline) Stetson from Kingston, Massachusetts. The parents were married in the gold rush town of Columbia, California, on April 17, 1859. Wheeler was raised in Oakland and attended public schools. In 1879 while he was in high school, his sister Gertrude Wheeler was born; she later married John W. Beckman and became a singing teacher, phonologist and inventor. Wheeler was raised alongside a brother who never sought higher education. In 1884, Wheeler graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of California, and began working in Oakland in the law office of John Henry Boalt. Concurrently, he studied advanced law at Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco and graduated in 1886, the same year he advanced to the bar.
Attorney.
As an attorney, Wheeler took up residence in San Francisco and continued with the law firm Garber, Boalt and Bishop. In 1892, Wheeler was made partner. After the deaths of Boalt and Judge John R. Garber, the firm was reconstituted as Bishop, Wheeler and Hoefler. In 1904, Wheeler headed his own firm, with no partners. In 1912 he took on a partner: attorney John F. Bowie, some fifteen years younger. By 1918, Wheeler worked occasionally with his son, Charles S. Wheeler Jr, as co-counsel. Wheeler's clients included the First National Bank, the Bank of British North America, the Barron Estate Co., and the First Federal Trust Co. of San Francisco. He specialized in probate law, mining claims, corporate law and real estate law; the office was on 14 Montgomery Street. From 1920 to 1923, Wheeler partnered with his son.
Wheeler was attorney to Phoebe Apperson Hearst, and to Elizabeth Boalt after the death of her husband, Wheeler's mentor John H. Boalt. Wheeler advised the two women in their gifts to the University of California School of Law, instituting the Hearst architectural plan including Hearst Memorial Mining Building and Boalt Hall of Law. When the plans were celebrated in early 1906, Wheeler announced a gift of $250,000 that he would use to endow a law professorship.
When Wheeler died on April 27, 1923, a number of memorial motions were made in various courts. These motions were combined into the 1924 book "Memorial motions in court upon the death of Charles Stetson Wheeler". One of them was as follows: "Mr. Wheeler was a man, in every sense of the word. A stranger coming within our gates meeting him on the street and observing him, his wonderful physique, his wonderful bearing, at once would exclaim, 'What man is this?
Society and politics.
In college, Wheeler joined the fraternity Beta Theta Pi and was later given honorary membership in Phi Delta Phi. He joined the San Francisco Art Association, the Bohemian Club, the Pacific-Union Club, the Olympic Club, and the Commonwealth Club, among others.
Wheeler served as a Regent of the University of California from 1892 to 1896, from 1902 to 1907, and again from 1911 to 1923.
After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Wheeler served on the Committee of Fifty, a group of prominent citizens who quickly took control of reconstruction when it became clear the San Francisco Board of Supervisors was unable. Wheeler held the position of secretary of the Relief Committee. In December 1908, he reported that the Relief Committee, because of its success in carrying out its mission, would be dissolved at the first of the year. He noted that $9.5 million had been distributed to those in need, and that the committee's administration costs had been 2% of that. The relief work had provided approximately 8,000 homes for 30,000 people.
Prior to the United States presidential election, 1912, Wheeler publicly debated the former California governor James N. Gillett on the question of which Republican nominee deserved the backing of his party, to be decided at the primary elections. Wheeler spoke for Theodore Roosevelt while Gillett argued for incumbent William Howard Taft. Wheeler said Taft was "blind to the signs of the times", the candidate of "men satisfied with the old political methods." In the event, Taft won the primary but Roosevelt ran anyway as a third party candidate, splitting the Republican vote to allow Woodrow Wilson to gain the presidency. In 1920, Wheeler traveled to Chicago to serve as alternate delegate for California at the Republican National Convention. The California delegation put Wheeler on the podium to give a rousing speech for the nomination of California-born candidate Hiram Johnson who had been Roosevelt's running mate in 1912.
Personal life.
Wheeler married fine artist Lillian Marsh, a few months his senior. She studied art with William Keith in San Francisco in the 1890s. She lived in that city all her life. After her husband's death, she took up residence at the Fairmont Hotel. She died in 1952.
Wheeler's offspring include son Charles Stetson Wheeler, Jr., and daughters Elizabeth, Jean, Lilias and Olive B.; all spending summers together with their parents in remote Northern California as reported in 1910.
A grandson, outdoorsman Charles ("Charley") Stetson Wheeler III, married Kathryn ("Katie") Anita Lillard (1920-2003) of the Irvine family of Southern California. Charley headed cattle operations for the Irvine Company from 1953 to 1977, then became the company's corporate secretary until his death in 1993. Katie joined the board of the James Irvine Foundation in 1950, guiding its decisions in making grants for the next half century until her death in 2003. An Orange County Public Library branch in Irvine was built to memorialize her: The Katie Wheeler Branch Library.
Wheeler Ranch.
In 1899 from innkeeper Lydia Sisson, the widow of landowner and outdoorsman Justin Sisson, Wheeler bought extensive land called "The Bend" in Siskiyou County, in the Cascade Range south by southeast of Mount Shasta on the McCloud River. He called this holding the Wheeler Ranch, and he built a hunting lodge on the river at Horseshoe Bend—its cornerstone laid in 1899. The lodge was designed by San Francisco architect Willis Polk, and included an 800-book library with room for hundreds of Native American baskets. Wheeler directed Polk to give the lodge a "fish tower"—a high study with a view, and two windows which were aquariums containing local trout. A Latin inscription over the entrance indicated this room was a temple to fishing: "piscatoribus sacrum". The Wheeler family stayed at the ranch many a summer.
In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst asked if she could purchase the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark who called it Wyntoon. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to her new lease and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built, one designed by Bernard Maybeck in the Gothic style of a Rhine River castle. Wheeler was "privately furious" with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. She built other structures including a cottage for overflow guests, another "honeymoon cottage", and a separate building housing the kitchen facilities. The castle was finished in 1904.
Wheeler retained the part of Wheeler Ranch that was not leased to Hearst, including the hunting lodge. In 1911, Wheeler invited Austro-Hungarian artist and naturalist Edward Stuhl and his wife Rosie to live on the property; they made extensive studies of plant and animal life in the area, and collected many hundreds of specimens. Stuhl, an avid mountain climber, published "Wildflowers of Mount Shasta" from his base at Wheeler Ranch. After Wheeler's death, Stuhl served as custodian of the ranch. William Randolph Hearst bought Wyntoon outright from Wheeler Ranch in 1929, and in 1934 bought Wheeler Ranch.

Turkish Union of Xanthi

The Turkish Union of Xanthi (, ) is one of the three most important organizations of the Turkish minority of Western Thrace. Founded in 1927, the organization was outlawed by Greek authorities in 1987 and 1999. In 2008, a decision of the European Court of Human Rights ordered the re-legalization of the association and convicted Greece of violating the freedom of association; however, the Greek authorities refused to re-legalize it. It has been accused of having relations with the Turkish Nationalist Movement Party and the far-right terrorist organization Grey Wolves. 
History.
The organization was founded in 1927 as the House of the Turkish Youth in Xanthi. In 1936 it was renamed and registered as the Turkish Union of Xanthi, which is its current name. In November 1987, along with other Turkish organizations of western Thrace, the Turkish Union of Xanthi was banned because according to the court the word "Turkish" in their titles as a description for members of the Muslim minority of Greece endangered public order and it should be used only to refer to Turkish citizens. In response to the court's decision, large protests, held primarily by Pomaks, took place in Komotini. The organization appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of Greece (Court of Cassation). In 2005, the Supreme Court of Greece ordered the dissolution of the association, which according to the court "constitutes an attempt to affirm the presence of a Turkish minority in Greece", although such rulings have been judged to be in breach of article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
The Turkish Union of Xanthi then appealed the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights. On March 27, 2008, the court re-legalized the organization and other Turkish associations of the region. Additionally, the rulings of the Greek courts were judged to be violations of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Greek government appealed the decision and refused to recognize the Turkish Union of Xanthi; however, the European Court of Human Rights upheld its first ruling. In December 2008 the Appeals Court of Thrace, which ruled against the re-legalization of the association, stated that the ECHR decision was non-binding and that the court had neglected to consider "political" factors in its decision.

Angolatitan

Angolatitan ("Angolan giant") is a genus of sauropod dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous and the first dinosaur discovered in Angola. Based on a forelimb, it was described in 2011 by Octávio Mateus and colleagues. The only species is "Angolatitan adamastor". "Angolatitan" was a relict form of its time, being a basal titanosauriform sauropod in a world dominated by the more derived titanosaurs.
Description.
The only specimen is a partial right forelimb, including shoulder blade, upper arm bone, the two bones of the lower arm (ulna and radius), and three metacarpals. These fossils (Field number MGUAN-PA-003) are stored in the "Museu de Geologia" of the "Universidade Agostinho Neto" in Luanda.
The upper arm bone measures , the ulna in length. In general, the forelimb was less robust than in most of the more derived titanosaurs. The metacarpals were slender and equal in length; those of titanosaurs were more robust with varying lengths. Unlike titanosaurs, the olecranon was absent, and the first metacarpal was not bowed.
Systematics.
"Angolatitan" was a basal titanosauriform, more derived than "Brachiosaurus" but less derived than "Euhelopus" and Titanosauria, which is notable given its relatively late appearance in the sauropod fossil record. It is classified as a Somphospondyli based on features of the upper arm bone.
Habitat.
The specimen was found in a 50 m thick subsection of the Itombe Formation, called the Tadi Beds, which could be dated late Turonian in age (approximately 90 million years old) based on the characteristic fish community. These rocks were deposited under marginary marine conditions; fossils include ammonites, echinoderms, and fishes (including sharks). Tetrapods include the turtle "Angolachelys mbaxi", the Mosasaurs "Angolasaurus bocagei" and "Tylosaurus iembeensis" as well as several plesiosaur fossils.
"Angolatitans" habitat would have been desert-like. Presumably, this sauropod would have been well adapted to very dry conditions as it is the case with today's desert elephants.
Discovery.
During Angolan Civil War, palaeontological field research was not possible in Angola. After the civil war ended in 2002, the PaleoAngola project planned the first Angolan palaeontological expeditions since the 1960s. The first of these expeditions started in 2005 to explore Angolas fossil rich upper cretaceous rocks, leading to the discovery of "Angolatitan". The discovery was made by Octávio Mateus on May the 25 near Iembe in the province of Bengo, and excavations were conducted during may and August 2006.
"Angolatitan adamastor" was described by Octávio Mateus and colleagues in 2011. The generic name means "Angolan giant". Adamastor is a mythological sea monster that represented the dangers Portuguese sailors faced in the southern Atlantic. Until 1975, Angola was a Portuguese colony.

Hepatocystis muuli

Hepatocystis muuli is a species of the genus "Hepatocystis". 
Species in this genus are parasitic protozoa transmitted by flies of the genus "Culicoides" and infect mammals. 
History.
This species was described in 1977 by Landau "et al". 
Geographical distribution.
This species is found in Kanchanaburi, Thailand.
Description.
The schizonts are intrahepatocytic and provoke an hypertrophy of the host cell and its nucleus which remain visible during the entire development of the tissue stage. Schizonts as they mature become very lobulated with abundant colloid which is irregularly distributed. They may reach a maximum size of 350 micrometres. Histiomacrophagic reaction of the surrounding tissue remains moderate before the maturity of the parasite.
Gametocytes are abundant and many erythrocytes are parasitized by immature forms. The mature gametocytes measure 7.7 to 9.3 (average 8.5) micrometres in diameter and are easily deformed. 
The microgametocytes have a diffuse nucleus. The macrogametocytes are lightly pigmented and have a large nucleus.
The size of the schizonts, their lobulated form and the hypertrophy of the host cell distinguish "H. muuli" from other Asian "Hepatocystis" species.
Host record.
This species infects Berdmore's ground squirrel ("Menetes berdmorei").

IParty with Victorious

"iParty with Victorious" is a 2011 three-part crossover episode of "iCarly" and "Victorious". Although it is a crossover, the episode only counts as an "iCarly" episode. The episode aired on June 11, 2011, at 8/7c. It premiered in Los Angeles on June 4, 2011, and was released on DVD on August 30, 2011.
The crossover's theme song mash-up, "Leave It All To Shine", premiered on on Nickelodeon and was online (YouTube) on June 7, 2011. The episode was watched by 7.3 million viewers. It also marked Kenan Thompson's brief return to Nickelodeon. iParty With Victorious was released on the 3rd season DVD of iCarly and on the second Volume of Victorious' first season DVD. The normal length version was released on both DVD sets.
Plot.
Carly (Miranda Cosgrove)(iCarly) is dating a boy named Steven Carson (Cameron Deane Stewart), who divides his time between his divorced parents in Seattle and Los Angeles. Every other month, Steven goes off to Los Angeles, where he is dating another girl named Tori Vega (Victoria Justice) (Victorious), who attends Hollywood Arts, a high school for the performing arts. Robbie Shapiro (Matt Bennett), a socially awkward friend of Tori's, posts a picture of Steven and Tori online, which Carly stumbles upon. She initially denies the fact that Steven is cheating on her, but Sam (Jennette McCurdy) seeks to prove it is indeed true. She finds Rex, Robbie's ventriloquist dummy, has tweeted about a party held at Kenan Thompson's house, in Hollywood.
Spencer (Jerry Trainor) drives the group to Los Angeles, where Carly, Sam, Freddie (Nathan Kress), Gibby (Noah Munck), and Spencer visit Spencer's ex-girlfriend, Monie (Jen Lilley), who happens to be a skilled make-up artist, and receive disguise makeovers to avoid being noticed from iCarly by others. They then head off to the house of actor and comedian, Kenan Thompson, where Andre Harris (Leon Thomas III), another friend of Tori's, is hosting a party that they suspect Steven and Tori are attending. The iCarly members enter Kenan's party house during the party and split up in search of Steven. Spencer, meanwhile, relaxes in Kenan Thompson's jacuzzi and meets Sikowitz (Eric Lange), Beck (Avan Jogia) and Jade (Elizabeth Gillies). Much to her chagrin, Carly eventually catches Steven and watches him kiss Tori, before she admits Sam is correct about Steven cheating on her. Sinjinn Van Cleef (Michael Eric Reid) another student at Hollywood Arts falls into the jacuzzi when a surfing machine malfunctions.
The iCarly members remove their disguises, and Tori walks in and immediately recognizes them from iCarly. After explaining Steven's actions, Carly and Tori devise a plan to humiliate Steven for revenge. Steven is lured into a closet where he thinks he will make out with Tori. Instead, when he enters the closet, he finds himself on an iCarly webcast with Carly, Sam, Kenan, and Tori, who reveal to iCarly's one million audience members Steven had been dating both Carly and Tori at the same time. Steven becomes embarrassed and leaves. Then Sam beats Rex in a rap battle. Later, the iCarly cast joins Tori and her friends in karaoke, where they sing "Leave It All to Shine", a cross between the "iCarly" and "Victorious" theme songs.
Production.
Dan Schneider has confirmed that because of the success of the film, he decided to give Nickelodeon an uncut, 2-hour version of it which contains material the production team edited out after filming. It aired August 27, 2011.
The episode "iParty With Victorious" was confirmed as an iCarly movie, not a TV crossover probably because of the lowercase "i" in the title which appeared in all iCarly episodes known (ex."iPilot","iQuit iCarly","iOMG").
Victoria Justice appears in "iCarly" for the second time for "iParty with Victorious". The first time she appeared in the series was in a previous television special "iFight Shelby Marx". Sam also comments that Tori Vega looks like Shelby Marx, who was also played by Justice. Also making return appearances are Leon Thomas III (the first time he appeared in the series was in "iCarly Saves TV"), Daniella Monet (the first time she appeared in the series was in a previous television special "iPsycho"), and Lane Napper (the first time he appeared in the series was as Ernie, Sam's dancing instructor in "iWas a Pageant Girl").
The crossover special also marks Kenan Thompson's brief return to Nickelodeon. Thompson previously starred in the Nickelodeon shows, "All That" (which Dan Schneider has previously worked on) and "Kenan & Kel".
The opening sequence only features clips from the "iParty with Victorious" episode, but there are some snippets of regular iCarly episodes before the episode title appears. Victoria Justice is credited with the iCarly cast in the opening sequence while the rest of the "Victorious" cast are credited during the in-show credits. Kenan Thompson is mentioned during the ending credits.
While in Kenan Thompson's house, "The Joke Is On You" by Niki Watkins, "Give It Up" by Elizabeth Gillies and Ariana Grande, performed in the "Victorious" episode "Freak the Freak Out", and "Number One (My World)" by fictional Ginger Fox was played.
Crossovers after "iParty with Victorious".
This is actually the first of four crossovers between "iCarly" and "Victorious". The second and third crossovers occur during each shows' April Fools Day specials, both of which debuted on March 24, 2012. At one point in the "Victorious" April Fools special, "April Fools Blank", Tori is seen coming out of the elevator and into the living room of Carly's apartment, where Spencer is sitting on the couch. Meanwhile, in the "iCarly" episode "iAprilFools", Carly, Sam, Freddie, and Spencer appear in Tori's living room sitting next to Robbie, who is actually a transformed version of Gibby. Sam also sings a line from "Make it Shine". The Nickelodeon series "Sam & Cat" (a spin-off of both shows) acts as the permanent fourth crossover, with Sam and Cat living as roommates and starting a babysitting service. Freddie, Robbie, and Jade make special return appearances in the "Sam & Cat" hour-long special "The Killer Tuna Jump", and Gibby made a special appearance in the "Sam & Cat" 45-minute special "Super Psycho".
This is also the first of three times that Jennette McCurdy has been involved with "Victorious"; the second was when McCurdy guest starred as "Crazy Ponnie" in the "Victorious" episode of the same name, and the third time was reprising her role of Sam on "Sam & Cat".
Reception.
This episode received mainly positive reviews from critics. Verne Gay of "The Republic" gave a positive review, suggesting "iParty with Victorious" may be the biggest event of the Summer 2011 and noting the scene depicting a guy in a panda costume chasing Kenan Thompson was hilarious. Carl Cortez of "Assignment X" praised the episode but also gave a slightly more critical review. He believes "the mechanism for verifying Carly’s boyfriend is cheating is a bit of a stretch". He reacted positively to how the times spent with the characters of "iCarly" and "Victorious" are evenly distributed. Overall, he finds the episode to be "enjoyable nonetheless" and gives it a grade of B-. This crossover aired during the 2011 NBA Finals and 2011 Stanley Cup.
Leave It All to Shine.
"Leave It All to Shine" is a song performed by Miranda Cosgrove from "iCarly" and Victoria Justice from "Victorious" for the crossover episode "iParty with Victorious". The song is a mash-up of the shows' theme songs, "Leave It All to Me" and "Make it Shine". The song was co-written by the creator of both shows, Dan Schneider, along with Michael "Backhouse Mike" Corcoran, while production was handled by award-winning songwriter-producer Dr. Luke, who also produced the original "Make it Shine". The song officially premiered on May 22, 2011 and a video was released on June 11, 2011, the day the crossover premiered. The song ended up on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at number twenty-four. The main vocals on "Leave It All To Shine" were performed by Cosgrove and Justice with background vocals provided by the rest of the casts of both shows as a part of the crossover episode. The song can also be heard on .

Oxalaia

Oxalaia (a reference to the African deity Oxalá) is a genus of carnivorous theropod. It is a spinosaurine spinosaurid which lived during the late Cretaceous (early Cenomanian stage, about 98 mya) in what is now Brazil. 
"Oxalaia" is known from the holotype MN 6117-V, fused premaxillae of a very large individual and from the referred fragment MN 6119-V, an isolated and incomplete left maxilla, which were found on Cajual Island, Maranhão of northeastern Brazil. Fossils of "Oxalaia" were recovered in 2004 from the Laje do Coringa locality of the Alcântara Formation, part of the Itapecuru Group of the São Luís Basin. Besides these bone fragments, numerous spinosaurid teeth had earlier been reported from the site.
The genus was named by Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner, Sergio A.K. Azevedeo, Elaine B. Machado, Luciana B. Carvalho and Deise D.R. Henriques in 2011 and the type species is "Oxalaia quilombensis". The specific name "quilombensis" refers to the quilombo settlements, such as on Cajual Island, which were founded by escaped slaves. Estimates suggest that it was in length and in weight —- it is the largest theropod known from Brazil and the eighth officially named species of theropod from Brazil.

Montreal steak seasoning

Montreal steak seasoning, also known as Montreal steak spice, Canadian steak seasoning, or Canadian steak spice, is a spice mix used to flavour steak and grilled meats that was based on the pickling dry-rub mix used in preparing Montreal smoked meat. The smoked meat seasoning is derived from pickling mixes used in Eastern Europe or Romanian Jewish cuisine. The primary constituents of Montreal steak seasoning include garlic, coriander, black pepper, Cayenne pepper flakes, dill seed, and salt. The spice mix recipe varies slightly among restaurants and manufacturers.
History.
The Montreal deli Schwartz's is credited with the creation of Montreal steak seasoning. The story of its creation is that, during the 1940s and 1950s, a Schwartz's broilerman by the name of Morris "The Shadow" Sherman began adding the deli's smoked meat pickling spices to his own rib and liver steaks. Soon the customers began asking for the same. Due to its popularity, it eventually became a norm in Montreal delis and steakhouses such as the nearby Moishes Steakhouse and the Main Deli Steak House to spice their steaks similarly.

Ivan Lazhechnikov

Ivan Ivanovich Lazhechnikov (), September 25, 1792 – July 8, 1869, was a Russian writer.
Biography.
Lazhechnikov was born into the family of a rich merchant in Kolomna in 1792. He received a well-rounded education from private tutors at home. He served in the active army in 1813–15, which inspired his "Campaign Notes of a Russian Officer".
Lazhechnikov was one of the originators of the Russian historical novel, along with Faddey Bulgarin, Mikhail Zagoskin and others. His first novel, "The Last Novik" (1831–33), set in the early 18th century, was very successful. His novel "The House of Ice" (1835) dealt with the intrigues and horrors of the court of Empress Anna. The novel was praised by the influential critic Vissarion Belinsky for its authentic portrayal of the details of the period’s social climate. "The Infidel", a novel set in the time of Ivan III, was translated into English as "The Heretic". He also published several historical dramas including "Oprichnik" (1843, published in 1859), on which the libretto of Tchaikovsky’s opera is based.
Lazhechnikov died in Moscow in 1869.

1997 Mahane Yehuda Market Bombings

The 1997 Mahane Yehuda Market Bombings were two consecutive suicide bombings carried out by Hamas militants on July 30, 1997 at the Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem, Israel, the city's main open-air fruit and vegetable market. Sixteen people were killed in the attack and 178 were injured.
The attack.
On Wednesday, July 30, 1997 at 1:15 pm, two Palestinian suicide bombers who carried bags laden with explosives and nails detonated their explosive devices 45 meters (150 feet) apart almost simultaneously in a central alley in the popular outdoor market, killing 16 civilians, among them an Arab resident of Eilabun, and injuring 178 people, many of them teenagers and tourists.
Thirteen Israelis were killed immediately and three others died later from their injuries. The Mahane Yehuda attack was followed by a triple suicide bombing on the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall in downtown Jerusalem on September 4, which killed five Israelis and wounded over 190.
Fatalities.
The following people died in the attack: 
Arab praise for the attack.
In August 1997, Fahad Rimawi, editor of the Jordanian weekly "Almajd," wrote: "We praise and glorify the double heroic act which two Palestinian 'mujahadins' performed in the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem. These two holy martyrs illuminated the night in Jerusalem...and gave meaning to Arab heroism. We do not hide our happiness upon this act."
Aftermath.
In retaliation for these and other attacks, a decision was reached to target Hamas leaders. According to an Israeli press release, Mossad agents tried to poison chairman Khaled Mashal, who resided at the time in Jordan. The assassination attempt failed and the Mossad agents were captured by the Jordanian authorities. They were later released in exchange for the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder and "spiritual leader" of Hamas who was serving a life sentence in an Israeli prison.

Lennox Football Club

Lennox Football Club was an English 19th century rugby union football club that disbanded in the early twentieth century. It is notable for producing a number of international players and for its role in the Rugby Football Union fight against professionalism.
History.
Lennox was founded in 1883, and as a sporting club played both rugby and cricket. The origins of its name are open to speculation, with Lennox being an area in central Scotland, and also a surname.
The club played at Clapham Common and changed at the Clapham Dining Rooms. Within two years the club had a first class fixture list and had moved from Clapham to a ground next to the Greyhound pub in Dulwich Village. At this time they changed their strip from the original dark blue with a badge to black, white and red hooped jerseys. They stayed in Dulwich throughout the rest of the 1880s and early 1890s, although in 1888 they had moved from Dulwich Village to Turney Road where they used the Crown Hotel to change. During their time in Turney Road their cricketing arm, Lennox CC, merged with Aeolian CC, also based on Turney Road, to form Dulwich Cricket Club, which still exists into the twenty-first century. From the 1890s, the home ground of the club was that of the London Athletic Club, situated in the Fulham Road, Chelsea. The original grounds were closed after the last athletics meeting on 24 September 1904, "and a new and larger track was made, partly on the same site, with a banked track for cycling and seating accommodation for 10,000 people. The new area of seventeen acres was still known as Stamford Bridge, and the L.A.C. opened with a meeting on 10 May 1905. During the winter months the ground is used by the Chelsea Football Club.""
The club were affiliated to the Surrey county and won the inaugural Surrey Cup, first played for in 1891. However, they do not appear at this stage to have been considered a prominent London side having not been mentioned in Francis Marshall's 1892 publication, "Football; the Rugby union game". However, in 1893 they gained more renown through the actions of H.E. Steed. On 20 September 1893, J. A. Miller of the Yorkshire county proposed at a meeting of the Rugby Football Union that players be allowed compensation for bona fide loss of time. This was seconded by his fellow Yorkshireman M. Newsome. The honorary secretary of the RFU, George Rowland Hill, opposed this and he was supported by R Whalley of Lancashire. A vote was cast and won by 282 to 136 votes in favour of declining to sanction the proposal for compensation for bona fide loss of time. Present at the meeting were an enormous amount of representatives from the north of England who had travalled to support the vote for compensation, having used two special trains for the purpose. However, H.E. Steed, of Lennox, described as a remarkable organiser, had already gained the proxies of 120 clubs against what was termed "professionalism".
The club maintained a first class fixture list into the early twentieth century but after their move from Stamford Bridge, they began to decline in favour and they became an almost nomadic side.
Disbandment.
Dick Tyson, in "London's Oldest Rugby Clubs" suggests the club were wound up shortly after the 1910–11 season. However, the official site of surrey county rugby lists past presidents of the county reveals that Lennox produced three presidents for the county and that the third of these was R.A. Sawyer, who served from 1913 to 1920. Although his term was extended due to the First World War and no rugby took place in that time, it would seem certain that Lennox existed when he took office in 1913.

Laminate panel

Laminate panel is a type of manufactured timber made from thin sheets of substrates or wood veneer. It is similar to the more widely used plywood, except that it has a plastic, protective layer on one or both sides. Laminate panels are used instead of plywood because of their resistance to impact, weather, moisture, shattering in cold (ductility), and chemicals.
Laminate panel layers (called veneers) are glued together with adjacent plies having their grain at right angles to each other for greater strength. The plastic layer(s) added for protection vary in composition, thickness, color and texture according to the application.
Types.
A number of varieties of laminate panel exist for different applications.
Sizes.
The most commonly used thickness range from 1/8" to 1/2" and 3/8", in a variety of colours and textures.
Applications.
Laminate panels are used in many applications that need weather-proof, impact resistant sheet material. Typical end uses of spruce plywood are:

Periannan Senapathy is a molecular biologist and genome researcher. He is president and scientific director of Genome Life Sciences, a Genome International company in Madison, Wisconsin, which develops next-generation DNA sequencing technologies.
Biography.
Senapathy has a Ph.D. in molecular biology. He conducted postdoctoral studies at the National Institutes of Health in 1980.
Before becoming president of Genome Life Sciences, Senapathy worked for the National Institutes of Health's Division of Computer Research and Technology in Bethesda, Maryland, and the Biotechnology Center of the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
Notable works.
Senapathy has observed that the reading-frame lengths in a random nucleotide sequence follow an exponential distribution, and has suggested the split-gene model, in which the most primitive unicellular eukaryotes a selective pressure existed to generate longer coding sequences and random sequences that were populated with in-frame nonsense codons, and intervened between short reading frames, started to be excised by an already existing spliceosome. This model proposes not only that the sequences excised contained random clusters of in-frame nonsense codons but also that the splice junction signal sequences and the branchpoint sequence originate from nonsense codons.
Independent Birth of Organisms.
Senapathy published a book titled "Independent Birth of Organisms" in 1994, he claimed in the book that all organisms on earth had originated independently from a number of chemical ponds, thus rejecting common descent Senapathy claimed that the book was the result of 12 years research in molecular biology.
Andrew Petto of University of Wisconsin reviewed Senapathy's book saying that even though Senapathy had written a book arguing for natural origins, that the first half of Senapathy's book read like a typical creationist treatise with arguments based on gaps in the fossil record and the mention of mutations to descredit evolutionary biology. However Petto also said: "If the read manages to survive the first 199 pages of anti-evolutionary diatribe, however, there are a couple of interesting ideas in this book". Petto further explained that Senapathy has some very interesting views about the origins of life, such as his interpretation of the primordial soup theory and that these ideas should be taken seriously by the reader.

Bill Shipman

William "Bill" Shipman (1 March 1886 – 26 August 1943) was an English cricketer who played over 100 first-class matches for Leicestershire. A right-arm fast bowler, he took 366 wickets during his 13-year career, at an average of 27.21. Shipman was a lower-order batsman and scored a total of 2,474 runs, with an average score of 14.30. Shipman played 110 of his 111 matches for Leicestershire between 1908 and 1914, but returned to make a single appearance for the county in the summer of 1921.
Biography.
Shipman was born in the village of Ratby, Leicestershire on 1 March 1886. He was one of three brothers who played cricket for Leicestershire; Alan Shipman played almost 400 matches for the county, while Albert Shipman appeared in seven matches for the second XI during the 1914 season. He died in Ratby on 26 August 1943, at the age of 57.
Cricket career.
Shipman began his Leicestershire career in the summer of 1908 and took four wickets on his County Championship debut in the drawn match against Essex in July of that year. Throughout the next five seasons, he was an almost ever-present for the county. Shipman attained personal-best figures of 9–83 against Surrey in September 1910, and went on to bowl three ten-wicket hauls in his career. His form for Leicestershire earned him appearances in two Test trial matches in the 1911 season; one for The Rest against the England Test side, and one for Gilbert Jessop's XI against a team selected by Plum Warner. In August 1911, Shipman scored 69 runs, his highest ever in a first-class match, in the County Championship defeat to Warwickshire. He scored half-centuries on six occasions during his career.

Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years

Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY) is a charity and membership organisation based in London and working in England and Wales. A standard-setting organisation, it promotes best practice and support childcare professionals to deliver high standards of care and learning.
History.
PACEY was founded, as the National Childminding Association (NCMA), in 1977 by a small group of registered childminders, local authority staff and parents. Originally the Association covered the UK, but the Scottish Childminding Association (SCMA) and the Northern Ireland Childminding Association (NICMA) [http://www.nicma.org/cms/index.php now support childminding in Scotland and Northern Ireland. NCMA changed its name to Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years in March 2013, to reflect the broadening of its membership to include nursery workers as well as childminders and nannies and the growing recognition of its members' professionalism.
Organisation.
PACEY's President, since March 2013, is childcare expert and author Penny Tassoni.
The Chair, since September 2011, is Sue Davis CBE, the first non-childcare professional in this role. She was previously chair of Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust.
Liz Bayram has been the Chief Executive since December 2005. From 2009 until July 2013 she job-shared in this role with Catherine Farrell, who has now left PACEY.
PACEY's head office is in Bromley, Kent. It also has an office in Cardiff, Wales.
Registered childminders and nannies.
Registered childminders care for one or more children under the age of eight for more than a total of two hours a day, usually in the childminder's home, for payment. They are usually self-employed and are inspected by Ofsted in England or the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales (CSSIW), [http://wales.gov.uk/cssiwsubsite/newcssiw/?lang=en to ensure they are providing a safe and stimulating environment for these children.
Unlike registered childminders, nannies are employed by parents, and work in the family home. They are not required to register with Ofsted in England or with CSSIW in Wales. However, to reassure parents that they have had an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check, first-aid and basic childcare training, nannies can join the voluntary Ofsted register or CSSIW's Voluntary Approval Scheme.
PACEY has campaigned against misuse of the term "childminder" in the media. In a letter to "The Sun", Susanna Dawson, who was then the organisation's Chair, complained about the newspaper's incorrect use of the word "childminder" when referring to illegally paid unregistered carers.
Research.
At its 2005 annual conference, the organisation's then-President, British childcare expert Dr Penelope Leach, outlined details of the findings of the longest and most detailed studies of UK childcare, which concluded that young children who are looked after by their mothers do significantly better in developmental tests than those cared for in nurseries, by childminders or relatives.
It found babies and toddlers fared worst when they were given group nursery care. Those cared for by friends or grandparents or other relatives did a little better while those looked after by nannies or childminders were rated second only to those cared for by mothers.
The study, by researchers led by Leach and colleagues Kathy Sylva and Alan Stein, began in 1998 and involved 1,200 children and their families from north London and Oxfordshire. Mothers were interviewed when their babies were three months old and again when they were 10, 18, 36 and 51 months.
In March 2013 PACEY's report "Childcare – not just a job, a vocation", based on research carried out in association with "Nursery World" magazine and NannyTax, found that low pay and poor status are concerns across the childcare profession – among childminders, nursery workers and nannies. In spite of this, the study found that for every £1 childcare workers are paid, they generate between £7 and £9.50 worth of benefits to society.
In September 2013 a survey by PACEY of more than 2,000 UK childcare workers, parents and teachers found that social skills and independence were rated more highly than key academic skills as indicators of young children's readiness to start school.
Campaigns.
In 2001 the Association campaigned for a reversal of new government regulations which allowed childminders to smack babies and toddlers and to smoke in the presence of children with parents' consent.
In April 2012 it launched a campaign, "Individual Inspection Matters", calling on the Government to retain individual registration and inspection of childminders in England. The campaign was launched in response to concerns that the Government is planning to take childminding out of the current inspection and regulation system and that this could lead to deregulation or regulation with a "lighter touch". It expressed concern that stepping away from individual Ofsted inspection threatened childminders' professional status.
In March 2013 Catherine Farrell, PACEY's joint executive, criticised government plans to increase the number of children that childcare providers can look after in England and to introduce childminder agencies as being "likely to reduce quality for children".
Communications.
PACEY's magazine, "The Childcare Professional", is published every two months.
Members have access to three helplines – a health and wellbeing helpline, a childcare and early years helpline and a legal helpline.

<doc id="31203687" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31203687" title="Attius Labeo">
Attius Labeo

Attius Labeo (active 1st century AD) was a Roman writer during the reign of Nero. He is remembered for the derision that greeted his Latin translations of Homer's "Iliad" and "Odyssey", which came to epitomise bad verse. He translated the original Greek into Latin hexameters. The satirist Persius poured scorn on Labeo. Later his name was used by English poets of the Elizabethan era to attack each other's verse.
Work.
His writings have not survived, but a single line of his translation has been preserved in scholia: "crudum manduces Priamum Priamique pisinnos", which was Labeo's translation of the words - ὠμòν ßεßρώΘοις Πρίαμον Πριάμοιó τε παîδας (Iliad, iv, 35). On the basis of this surviving line, it has been suggested that the translation was considered to be vulgar, since the words 'manduces' and 'pisinnos' would have "undoubtedly struck Romans as exotically 'low'". In English the line means, roughly, "Raw, you'd chew both Priam and Priam's kids."
Persius.
Persius, a contemporary of the translator, refers to Labeo in his "Satires" as the epitome of a bad poet, mentioning him in his discussion of his reasons for taking up his pen:
O curas hominum! o quantum est in rebus inane!<br>
"Quis leget haec?" min tu istud ais? Nemo hercule. "Nemo?"<br>
Vel duo, vel nemo. "Turpe et miserabile." Quare?<br>
Ne mihi Polydamas et Troïades Labeonem<br>
Praetulerint? Nugae!
RGM Nesbitt translates these lines as: "The toils of men! The emptiness of life! 'Who's going to read that?' Are you talking to me? Nobody, of course. 'Nobody?' Well, two at the most. 'That's a poor show.' Why? Because Polydamas and the Trojan Women may prefer Labeo to me? Bosh." Polydamas was a Trojan leader in the "Iliad" characterised by his timidity. He and the women of Troy tried to stop Hector making a bold attack on the Greeks.
Persius also says that Labeo must have made the translation while "drunk with hellebore" ("ebria ueratro").
English satire.
Following Persius' use of the name, Elizabethan English satirists used the name "Labeo" as a code for a bad poet. "Labeo" appears in Joseph Hall's "Satires", in which he is accused of writing bad pastoral, erotic and heroic verse, evidently a reference to poetry of the time. The identity of Hall's "Labeo" is disputed. It has been suggested that Michael Drayton may be the target. Samuel Daniel has also been suggested. However, it has been argued that Hall's "Labeo" is a composite figure, standing for the vulgarity of modern poetry, as Hall saw it. In the view of Oscar James Campbell, "The English Labeo is best regarded as a type figure representing each and every one of the assiduous and tasteless Elizabethan translators."
Likewise, John Marston mentions "Labeo" in "Pygmalion's Image", which includes the words, "So Labeo did complain his love was stone,/Obdurate, flinty, so relentless none." It may be that this use of the "Labeo" persona is an attack on Shakespeare, since the lines resemble a passage in "Venus and Adonis". 
John Milton in an early essay quotes Persius on Labeo, referring to academic rivalries,

The STOAG has more than 120 buses and 6 trams for the line 112 which drives out of the neighbour-town Mülheim to the Neumarkt in Sterkrade. Most buses drives each 20 or 30 minutes which is usual for the Ruhr-Area.
The exact frequencies are in the rush-hour:
The line 959 drives circa 20 times a day between Sterkrade and Holten.
Timetable change in summer 2011.
In future, from 12th June 2011 the STOAG creates a new network. Because the city council-order the STOAG should save circa 1,7 million Euro in 2011 and more than 2,1 million Euro in 2012. So the traffic planners of the STOAG decided for this new network:
All bold written things will change in June
All "italic" written things are out of Oberhausen
All things in brackets won't be approached any more
The lines which are dropped are: SB96, 952, 987
The lines SB97 and 958 are connected at the Central Station (Hauptbahnhof). That means, the buses from SB97 which ends there does not turn back to Königshardt. They continue as 958 to Sterkrade. The buses from Sterkrade on 958 continues as SB97 to Königshardt.

1965 Pacific hurricane season

The 1965 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 1965 in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1965 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1965. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeast Pacific Ocean. A total of ten systems were observed. The most notable storm was Tropical Storm Hazel, which killed six people in Mexico.
Storms.
Tropical Storm Victoria.
On June 4, a tropical depression formed 585 miles (945 km) southwest of Acapulco, Mexico Early the next day, the depression system intensified into the first tropical storm of the season and was named "Victoria". At that time, the storm was at its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) which it retained while moving the northwest. Early on June 7, the tropical storm weakened into a tropical depression before dissipating six hours later. In all, Tropical Storm Victoria stayed at sea.
Tropical Storm Wallie.
Early on the morning of June 17, a tropical depression formed 185 miles (300 km/h) west of Puerto Angel, Mexico. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Wallie. Meanwhile, Wallie was at its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h). Wallie headed northwest and degenerated into an area of low pressure just off the Mexican coast early on June 18. The remnant low made landfall in the near Zihuatanejo, Mexico early on June 18. The low dissipated later that day.
Damage in Mexico from Wallie was described as the worst in eight years. Monetary damages were described was being in the "thousands", however an exact damage total is unknown. No deaths were reported due to the storm.
Tropical Storm Ava.
Early on June 29, a tropical storm was identified 535 miles (860 km) south of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and named "Ava". At that time, the storm was at peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h). However, Tropical Storm Ava weakened into a tropical depression within 24 hours. Late on June 30, the depression re-strengthened into a tropical storm and regained peak intensity. At this time, the storm took a track that went north and back south gently. On July 3, Tropical Storm Ava weakened into a tropical depression. Ava dissipated early on July 5. The tropical storm stayed at sea, and no damage was reported. 
Tropical Storm Bernice.
On June 30, Tropical Storm Bernice formed. At this time, the system was located 275 miles (445 km) south of Puerto Angel, Mexico. For the next few days, the storm moved northeastward, while maintaining peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h). On July 5, Bernice stopped its northeastward motion and began to turn east, Berice dissipating on July 8, without ever impacting any land masses.
Tropical Storm Claudia.
During the afternoon of August 7, a tropical depression formed 150 miles southwest of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. On August 8, the cyclone strengthened into a Tropical Storm Claudia. At that time, Claudia was reaching its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) was beginning to recurve to the north. The storm remained at peak intensity while re-curving until August 10 when the wind speeds deceased slightly and advisories were discontinued. The storm never affected land.
Tropical Storm Doreen.
Late on August 19, Tropical Storm Doreen was first located with a TIROS satellite image. The next day, a ship, the "San Juan Prospector" reported winds of 40 knots (45 mph, 70 km/h) and a pressure of 975 mbar (hPa). At this time, Doreen was moving to the northwest as 10 knots. On August 21, Doreen altered its course to the west, but reversed back to its original heading the next day. On the August 22, the ship "Kyoyu Maru", which was just north of the storm's center reported winds of 60 knots (70 mph, 115 km/h). Over the next few days, the storm gently recurved northward but then slowed down and headed to the southwest. On August 30, Tropical Storm Doreen crossed the Central Pacific where it dissipated the next morning. During the course of the system, 13 ships reported winds related to Doreen, but no damage was reported.
Hurricane Emily.
On August 30, a moderate tropical storm developed. It slowing intensified, becoming the first hurricane of this season at 1200 UTC August 31. Emily began to weaken while moving northward in the Eastern Pacific. On 0000 UTC time September 3, Emily weakened into a tropical depression. It hit Baja California at the same intensity on September 6. According to one source, Emily was the first potentially hazardous storm in many years to approach Southern California. It approached Southern California while the SEALAB II Project was underway at La Jolla, California. There was concern that waves from Emily would move the "Berkone", a support ship for SEALAB, away from the SEALAB site as the project would have to be halted. Rainfall totals reach 1 in (25 mm) in isolated areas.
Tropical Storm Florence.
Tropical Storm Florence first formed on September 8 as a tropical depression. After 24 hours, Florence intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the cyclone peaked with 50 mph 80 km/h) winds. However, on September 11, Florence suddenly weakened. After maintaining its intensity for a while, the depression was declared dissipated. Florence stayed at sea and no deaths or damage were reported.
Tropical Storm Glenda.
Tropical Storm Glenda formed on September 13 and maintained the same intensity of 50 mph(85 km/h) for nine days before advisories were dropped. 
Tropical Storm Hazel.
Hazel developed from a northward-moving disturbance that originated southeast of Socorro Island. After reaching tropical storm strength on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone turned to the east-northeast – a motion confirmed by a ship report. The storm made landfall near Mazatlán on September 26 and quickly became extratropical. Thousands more were left homeless. Mazatlán's shrimp fleet, which makes up the base of the city's economy, suffered major damage, while in southern Sinaloa, 55,000 acres of cotton, corn, and sorghum were lost. At least 50 boats were damaged or sunk by the storm. The damage from the storm was estimated at $10 million (1965 USD) and possibly more, making Hazel the costliest tropical cyclone of the season.
Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) rating.
Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is a measure of the activity of a hurricane season. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in brackets.

1988 New Zealand rugby league season

The 1988 New Zealand rugby league season was the 81st season of rugby league that had been played in New Zealand. The main feature of the year was the World Cup final that was played at Eden Park. Australia defeated New Zealand in the final 25-12. Auckland won the National Provincial Competition.
International competitions.
World Cup final.
New Zealand met Australia in the World Cup final, the culmination of four years of competition. At the end of four years, Australia finished top of the table, and, through their victory over Great Britain in Christchurch, the Kiwis qualified to host the final. The Final was played at Eden Park, the first occasion that rugby league had used the ground since 1919. Prior to kick-off Graham Brazier performed the New Zealand national anthem.
New Zealand:
1. Gary Mercer; 2. Tony Iro; 3. Kevin Iro; 4. Dean Bell (c); 5. Mark Elia; 6. Gary Freeman; 7. Clayton Friend
8. Peter Brown; 9. Wayne Wallace; 10. Adrian Shelford; 11. Mark Graham; 12. Kurt Sorenson; 13. Mark Horo
Replacements: Shane Cooper & Sam Stewart
Coach: Tony Gordon
Australia:
1. Garry Jack; 2. Dale Shearer; 3. Andrew Farrar; 4. Mark McGaw; 5. Michael O'Connor; 6. Wally Lewis (c); 7. Allan Langer
8. Paul Dunn; 9. Ben Elias; 10. Steve Roach; 11. Paul Sironen; 12. Gavin Miller; 13. Wayne Pearce
Replacements: David Gillespie & Terry Lamb
Coach: Don Furner
Due to the inexperience of the Australian team, the hosts went into the match as favourites in the eyes of many critics. However, the Wally Lewis-led Kangaroos - boasting the likes of Ben Elias, Allan Langer, Paul Sironen and David Gillespie among their 'inexperienced' - triumphed over the ill-disciplined Kiwis, who at least made sure the victorious Australians were bloodied and bruised for their victory lap. For the Kiwis, the Iro brothers, Dean Bell, Gary Freeman, Clayton Friend, Mark Graham, Adrian Shelford and Kurt Sorenson dished out the punishment.
The New Zealand Rugby League called for an inquiry after the result. It was revealed that Gary Mercer was carrying a rib injury before into match and, in hindsight, should not have played in the final. After the match the NZRL stated that it would use Eden Park again in the future, however it did not hold another Test match until 2010, during the Four Nations. A week before the final a Wellington Invitational side gave Australia a solid warm up match, losing 12-24.
Other International competitions.
Earlier in the season the New Zealand Kiwis played in several other Test series, included two matches that counted towards the World Cup. In February a Presidents XIII lost 38-6 to the new Brisbane Broncos franchise at Lang Park. The team was captained by Barry Harvey. An Auckland v Rest of New Zealand match was held as a Kiwis trial, with Auckland winning 32-6. An hour later Tony Gordon announced his team for the World Cup clash against Papua New Guinea. The team was: Darrell Williams, Shane Horo, Gary Mercer, captain Dean Bell, Kevin Iro, Shane Cooper, Clayton Friend, Adrian Shelford, Peter Brown, Wayne Wallace, Mark Graham, Sam Stewart, Mark Horo. Reserves: Esene Faimalo and Gary Freeman. The Kiwis won 66-14 in front of 9,000 fans at Carlaw Park. PNG had earlier beaten Midlands and Waikato 58-0 and 38-12 respectively. After the Test match they defeated Northland 58-14 before heading home via Australia.
The Kiwis victory set up a must win clash with Great Britain the following Sunday, with the winner advancing to the final. The final Test of the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour of Austrlasia, it was held at Addington Showgrounds and was won 12-10 by the Kiwis, with Gary Freeman scoring both tries. The weekend earlier Great Britain had defeated Wellington 24-18. After the Test match Great Britain ended their 18 match tour of Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand by playing Auckland. Auckland, fielding a relatively inexperienced side, won 30-14.
As part of the Australian Bicentenary, the Kangaroos played a Rest of the World side coached by Graham Lowe. The side included eight players from New Zealand; Gary Mercer, Dean Bell, Kevin Iro, Shane Cooper, Wayne Wallace, Adrian Shelford, Mark Graham who captained the side and Sam Stewart.

Agbogbloshie

Agbogbloshie is a former wetland and suburb of Accra, Ghana known as a destination for legal and illegal exportation and
environmental dumping of electronic waste (e-waste) from industrialized nations. Often referred to as a "digital dumping ground", millions of tons of e-waste are processed each year in Agbogbloshie. As of March 2014, it was the world's largest e-waste dump.
The town covers approximately four acres and is situated on the banks of the Korle Lagoon, northwest of Accra's Central Business District. Roughly 40,000 Ghanaians inhabit the area, most of whom are migrants from rural areas. Due to its harsh living conditions and rampant crime, the area is nicknamed "Sodom and Gomorrah".
The Basel Convention prevents the transfrontier shipment of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. Only three countries, the United States, Afghanistan and Haiti, have never ratified the convention. Each month, cargo containers arrive in Agbogbloshie, often illegally, from countries all over the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. Unprotected workers, many of them young children, spend the day searching for metals to sell, usually by burning the electronics and dismantling them with their bare hands. In the process, they may earn upwards of eight to ten Ghana cedis per day (4 to 6 USD).
The waste processing emits toxic chemicals into the air, land and water. Exposure is especially hazardous to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive system, the nervous system, and especially the brain. Concerns about human health and the environment of Agbogbloshie continue to be raised as the area remains heavily polluted. In the 2000s, the Ghanaian government, with new funding and loans, implemented the Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project (KLERP), an environmental remediation and restoration project that will address the pollution problem by dredging the lagoon and Odaw canal to improve drainage and flooding into the ocean.
Background.
Before the arrival of electronic waste, the slum area of Agbogbloshie was once a wetland, referred to as Old Fadama or Ayaalolo. During the 1980s, it was a place of shelter for refugees from the Kokomba and the Nanumba war. It was not until the late 1990s that the landscape began to shift. Functional second-hand computers began arriving from the West to help ‘bridge the digital divide’. Ghanaians welcomed these donations, because these computers cost 1/10th of a new one. 
As the turnover rate of electronics increased, the once benevolent act of donating used computers became corrupted. Unsalvagable electronics started to be exported to Ghana in mass quantities. For Western countries, such as the United States, which have strict laws controlling the disposal of e-waste, it is cheaper to ship outdated and damaged computers to developing countries under the “donation” label than to properly recycle the electronics.
Economy.
The local economy of Agbogbloshie is based on the electronic waste imports and the processing of these goods. Hundreds of millions of tons of electronic waste are imported to the area each year. The United States is the leading exporter of e-waste to Ghana, although imports arrive from other countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Korea, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Multinational brands such as Philips, Canon, Dell, Microsoft, Nokia, Siemens and Sony are commonly found throughout the waste. 
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are even found adding to the waste when excess electronics are donated in with the intention of helping scholarly institutions. Exporters have found numerous loopholes to avoid legislation which prevent e-waste shipping, such as labeling broken electronics as ‘end-of-life’ or ‘second-hand-goods’, falsely identifying them as in working order. Between 50% and 75% of the electronics imported are unable to be salvaged and remain on the land.
Unprotected workers, mostly boys between 11–18 years old, process the imports in search for metals, such as copper, aluminum and iron, to collect and sell. To gain access to the metals, the workers burn old foam on top of the electronics in order to melt the plastic, or they dismantle the waste with their bare hands and stones. Magnets from other rubbished electronics are then used to gather the smallest of metal scraps left behind in the process. The remaining materials are further burned or dumped nearby.
The workers, children and adults alike, sell the metal scraps to earn a living. A half a sack of copper or aluminium will sell for about 700 Ghana Cedis, amounting to about eight to ten Ghana cedis per day (4 to 6 USD).
Living conditions.
The population of Agbogbloshie consists of economic migrants from northern and rural parts of Ghana. Living standards in the north and rural areas are growing worse, causing people to move to urban settings, such as Agbogbloshie. Conditions may not be significantly better, but making a living is easier. Inhabitants of Agbogbloshie live, eat, work and relieve themselves on the land and amongst the waste. Children who are able to attend school often spend every evening and weekend processing waste searching for metals. 
Dwellings are wooden shacks that lack water and sanitation. The area is also home to armed robbers, prostitutes, drug dealers and others involved in underground markets. Crime and disease run rampant throughout Agbogbloshie, creating an almost uninhabitable environment for humans. Outsiders have nicknamed the area “Sodom and Gomorrah,” after two condemned Biblical cities, due to the harsh living conditions in Agbogbloshie.
Pollution.
The processing and dumping of electronic waste in Agbogbloshie is polluting the area and creating serious environmental concern. E-waste contains toxic chemicals that are emitted into the ground, water and atmosphere when the electronics are broken down, burned and processed. Poisons such as lead, mercury, arsenic, dioxins, furans, and brominated flame retardants seep into the surrounding soil and water, thereby seriously polluting the landscape. Greenpeace labs tests have shown the water and soil from areas in Agbogbloshie revealed the area contained concentrations of toxins at levels a hundred times more than the allowable amount.
The Korle Lagoon, on which Agbogbloshie is situated, has extremely low levels of dissolved oxygen, as a result of the large and uncontrolled quantities of domestic and industrial waste being emitted into the water. Studies indicate that the entrance to the lagoon is severely polluted and not suitable for primary or secondary contact, due to the large amounts of bacteria present.
Human health risks.
Processing electronic waste presents a serious health threat to workers at Agbogbloshie. The fumes released from the burning of the plastics and metals used in electronics are composed of highly toxic chemicals and carcinogens. Workers often inhale lead, cadmium, dioxins, furans, phthalates and brominated flame retardants. 
Exposure to these fumes is especially hazardous to children, as these toxins are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive system, the nervous system, and the brain in particular. In similar e-waste processing areas, with conditions and demographics like those of Agbogbloshie, 80% of the children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. Inhabitants often suffer from chronic nausea, headaches, chest and respiratory problems.
High levels of toxins have also been discovered in soil and food samples, as these chemicals stay in the food chain.
Information security.
E-waste presents a potential security threat to individuals and exporting countries. Hard drives that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. Credit card numbers, private financial data, account information and records of online transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local scams.
Government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in Agbogbloshie. Multi-million dollar agreements from United States security institutions such as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Transportation Security Administration and Homeland Security have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.
Restoration efforts.
The Ghanaian government has made an effort to restore the area through the “Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project” (KLERP). In 2003, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development provided a loan for this project with the expectation that the Ghanaian government dredge the lagoon and restore its surroundings. Other goals of the project include a reduction in flooding, an increase in marine life, an improvement of water quality and an improvement in general sanitary conditions. 
Due to the invasive nature of the project, these restoration efforts have been disputed by the inhabitants of Agbogbloshie. The KLERP requires the people to leave the area, which is the only home for a majority of squatters. The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has continually tried to evict the people, but have only been met with much resistance. The matter is still in dispute.

Pintomyia falcaorum

Pintomyia falcaorum is an extinct species of sandfly in the moth fly subfamily Phlebotominae. "P. falcaorum" is solely known from early Miocene Burdigalian stage Dominican amber deposits on the island of Hispaniola.
History and classification.
The species is known solely from the holotype specimen, a complete male fly. The specimen is currently residing in the phlebotomine sandfly collection in the Centro de Pesquisas René Rachou. The centro is part of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Minas Gerais Brazil. The specimen was collected from an unidentified amber mine in the Cordillera Septentrional north of Santiago de los Caballeros. The specimen was first studied by sandfly researchers Reginaldo Peçanha Brazil and José Dilermando Andrade Filho. Brazil and Andrade Filho published their 2002 type description in the journal "Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz". The specific epithet ""falcaorum"" was coined by the author in honor of Alda and Alberto Falcão, to recognize their contributions to Phlebotominae understanding.
Description.
A number of features in the specimen indicate its placement in the moth fly subfamily Phlebotominae and the tribe Lutzomyiina. The specimen displays pre-apical bristles, and four spines on the style, these features combined with the AIII flagellomere being over half the length of the head. This combination of features indicates a placement in the genus "Pintomyia". Within the genus, it is placed in the subgenus "Pifanomyia", based on the posterior femurs lack of spines, but the species does not resemble the known modern species-group series. The light coloration of the abdomen on "P. falcaorum" is unlike the "P. monticola" series, while the "P. pacae" series have papillpae on the AXIII segment. Papillae on the AV segment of the "P. verrucarum", "P. serrana" and "P. townsendi" mark them as different from "P. falcaorum".
Like "Pintomyia falcaorum" the Dominican amber fly species "Pintomyia paleotownsendi" has a Sc vein that is free while the Sc meets the costa vein in "P. paleotrichia". In contrast "P. brazilorum", "P. killickorum", "Lutzomyia filipalpis", "L. miocena", "L. paleopestis", "L. schleei", and "L. succini" all possess an Sc which meets the R1 vein. The presence of a forked Sc vein in the wings, found in some "Lutzomyia" species including "L. adiketis", is unique among the described species of sandflies from Dominican amber. Living members of the Phlebotominae suck blood from vertebrates, and "P. falcaorum" is presumed to have done so as well. However, the host(s) of this species has not been identified at this time.

Porphyrophobia

Porphyrophobia is a fear of or aversion to the color purple and is the subgroup of chromophobia. Like all other phobias, including all of color phobias, the original cause of porphyrophobia traces back to a traumatic experience involving the color purple in the past. Even though purple is the symbolic color of royalty, people can suffer from purple phobia quite readily due to a traumatic encounter that is not a very common color around. For example, getting hit by a rare purple car, resulting in serious consequences. Porphyrophobics would be easy to avoid seeing or encountering purple due to the rarity of the color, so suffering panic from it would be difficult. Sufferers (especially those who had purple poison ivy rash) may associate purple with poison, readily causing toxiphobia.

Wright-Patt Credit Union

Wright-Patt Credit Union (WPCU) is a US credit union or financial cooperative headquartered in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton. WPCU is registered as a state-chartered type credit union, is the largest member-owned credit union in Ohio, and is one of the 50 largest credit unions in the United States. , WPCU has over $2.7 billion USD in assets, and nearly 270,000 members. WPCU is federally insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which insures accounts in federal and most state-chartered credit unions in the United States. Deposits with Wright-Patt Credit Union are insured to $250,000.
History.
The organization that is now Wright-Patt Credit Union was founded in 1932. It was during the national economic depression of the early 1930s (the Great Depression) that federal employees at Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) recognized the need for an “every person” financial institution. Since that time, WPCU has become Ohio’s largest member-owned credit union and one of the largest in the United States. Today, WPCU serves thousands of members from numerous employer and community groups and associations. WPCU has been known by the following names since its inception:<br>
Membership.
As with all credit unions, membership in Wright-Patt Credit Union is limited to individuals sharing the common bond defined in its credit union charter. WPCU primarily serves the Greater Dayton Area in the Miami Valley Region of Ohio, but other select areas are also eligible to join. Membership in WPCU is limited to the following: Like all credit unions, WPCU is governed by a board of volunteers, elected by and from its membership. WPCU also owns a separate subsidiary, myCUmortgage, LLC, which operates as a Credit Union Service Organization (CUSO). CUSOs were established by NCUA as a way for credit unions to offer products and services that would normally be outside of the credit union’s scope.
Services.
Wright-Patt Credit Union offers a full selection of products and services typically found at most financial institutions, including savings accounts, checking accounts, consumer loans and certificates of deposit. Credit unions are financial cooperatives so their savings accounts are referred to and recorded as “shares” because they represent members’ ownership of the credit union. Anyone eligible for membership can become an owner of the credit union by opening an account and depositing $5.00 into a “share” savings account. Additionally, WPCU offers its members small business loans, auto loans, mortgage loans, student loans, credit cards, lines of credit, health savings accounts, IRA accounts, direct deposit (through ACH), telephone banking, online banking, mobile banking, and remote deposit as well as many other services.
Member Center & ATM locations.
, Wright-Patt Credit Union operates 26 member centers (commonly called branches) around the Greater Dayton area, and Columbus in Ohio. They also partner with other ATM providers giving members lower-to-no-fee access to any Alliance One, CO-OP Network, Allpoint, or STAR ATM. WPCU has also partnered with other credit unions in the United States through the Shared Service Center network (CU Service Centers), which allows WPCU members to conduct most of their financial business at other credit union locations as if they were at their own local WPCU member center.

Septfontaines Castle

Septfontaines Castle (, ) in central Luxembourg is one of the castles belonging to the Valley of the Seven Castles. Located high above the village of Septfontaines, the medieval castle is now privately owned.
History.
It is not clear when the first castle was built in Septfontaines. In 1192, there is a reference to someone by the name of Tider who was Lord of Septfontaines. In 1233, Jean de Septfontaines placed the property under the protection of Countess Ermesinde of Luxembourg. At the beginning of the 14th century, Thomas de Septfontaines, a friend and companion of Emperor Henry VII, was the lord of the castle. In 1600, Christoph von Criechingen built a huge Renaissance tower at the northern entrance. In 1779, a fire destroyed the castle which increasingly fell into ruin. In 1919, the castle was partly demolished but in 1920 the owners attempted to carry out restoration work but unfortunately did not pay much attention to historical architectural requirements. 
The castle today.
Today the castle is privately owned and cannot be visited.

Thomas Zeltner

Thomas Zeltner (born 1947 in Berne, Switzerland) is a Swiss physician, lawyer, and former Secretary of Health of Switzerland Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA. He now serves as Special Envoy to the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO). He has a long history as an innovative leader in public health and has repeatedly been ranked among the 12 most influential political figures of Switzerland.
Dr. Zeltner is Professor at the University of Berne, Switzerland, in Public Health; Visiting Scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health; and Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Programme on Global Health at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva. He is an honorary member of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences and serves on the board of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences.
He is a co-founder of the Global Patient Safety Forum, along with Dr. Charles Denham.
Past.
Zeltner was graduated with an M.D. and an LL.M. (master's in law) from the University of Berne. He specialized in human pathology and forensic medicine before becoming the head of Medical Services at the Bern University Hospital. He held various faculty positions at the University of Bern and at the Harvard School of Public Health.
In 1991, the Swiss Government appointed Zeltner as the 8th Director-General of the Swiss National Health Authority and Secretary of Health of Switzerland, a position he held until the end of 2009.
Under Zeltner's leadership, Switzerland developed in 1991 a pioneering illicit drug policy, which has received global attention. It is based on a 4-pillar strategy (prevention, harm reduction, therapy, and law enforcement), which is enshrined in the Swiss law on narcotic drugs. The harm reduction policy of Switzerland – which includes large-scale syringe exchange programs (also in prisons) and the medical prescription of heroin for chronic heroin addicts – was introduced against the strong opposition of the UN drug control authorities, but endorsed by a majority of the Swiss population in several popular referenda.
In 1999-2000, at the request of the then-Director General of WHO, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Zeltner chaired a committee which investigated the efforts of multinational tobacco companies to undermine tobacco control activities of the World Health Organization (2000). This landmark report marks the beginning of the development of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (2003). With his efforts to reduce tobacco consumption in Switzerland, Zeltner became a favorite adversary of big tobacco and was nicknamed “the Tobacco Taliban."
As Director General of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, he presided over changes to transform the regulated market model of the Swiss health care sector into a more value- and consumer-driven health care system. The Swiss model guarantees access to affordable insurance to all, even if they have pre-existing medical problems. All residents are required to buy insurance even if they’re currently healthy, so that the risk pool remains reasonably favorable. Finally subsidies are given to low income families to pay for their premiums. Even though the Swiss pay 11.0% of the GDP for health (data 2011), a majority of 78% considers that the system works well or very well. The Swiss health care model is gaining increased international interest, particularly in the U.S.
Zeltner was a member and Vice-President of the Executive Board of the World Health Organization (WHO) (1999-2002). He chaired the committee to reform the governance rules of the WHO in 2002-4. He was also Executive President of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe (1994–95) and Chairman of the Governing Council of IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1998-2000).
Current position.
Zeltner currently serves as Special Envoy of the World Health Organization (WHO). In this capacity he advises the Director General of WHO Margaret Chan in critical areas of the current reform of this UN agency (how to cooperate with non-State actors and the private sector without compromising WHO’s integrity; how to better align WHO’s priorities with the resources available to finance them).
Together with Dr. Charles Denham, he is co-founder of the Global Patient Safety Forum, a convening organization of the world's leading patient safety organizations; Drs. Zeltner and Denham collaborated on the article "Safe use of electronic health records and health information technology systems: trust but verify." Dr. Zeltner is Managing Editor of the "Journal of Patient Safety". He is also a member of the Global Agenda Council on Digital Health of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
He is a member of the board of the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences; chairman of Science-et-Cité; and an honorary member of the Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences. Since 1992, he has been Professor of Public Health at the University of Berne and is a Visiting Scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health (Boston). He chairs the Advisory Board of the Global Health Programme at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva and lectures on health diplomacy there.
Zeltner is Chairman of the board of the health insurer KPT, the leading online insurance company in Switzerland, which is repeatedly qualified as the best health insurer of Switzerland. He is also president of Blood Transfusion CRS Switzerland, the organization in charge of securing Switzerland’s provision with blood and blood products.

It's a Boy (film)

"It's a Boy" is a 1933 British comedy film directed by Tim Whelan and starring Leslie Henson, Albert Burdon and Edward Everett Horton. It is a farce about a blackmailer who attempts to demand money from a young woman on the brink of marriage. It was based on the 1931 play "It's a Boy" by Austin Melford.
Plot.
On the eve of his society wedding, Dudley Leake and his best man James Skippett get drunk at his bachelor party. While in his cups Dudley confides to his friend about a brief fling he had with a woman just before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The following morning they oversleep and are late for their wedding. While they are dressing themselves Joe Piper, a young man with a strong Northern accent, appears at the flat and claims to be Dudley's illegitimate son from his pre-war tryst.
The two men reject his claim, and leave him in the care of Allister the butler and hurry off to the wedding only to discover they have arrived too late. The ceremony has been postponed as the bride's family have gone. They hurry round to the Bogle household to try and justify their behaviour to Mary Bogle and her stern father. Rather than explain about being drunk, they claim they were called to an urgent business meeting and spend the rest of the day trying to produce a famous author "John Tempest" who they claim will provide them with an alibi about their late arrival.
Allister the butler, meanwhile, has been unable to prevent Joe Piper discovering about the wedding and he also heads to the Bogle household and begins demanding large sums of money from Dudley in exchange for keeping quiet about their relationship. Skippett then persuade Joe Piper to pretend to be Tempest unaware that in real life she is actually a woman, and one of the bride's guests at the wedding. They slowly dig themselves deeper and deeper into a hole, and the Bogles prepare to leave for a holiday in the South of France.
Eventually, after both Piper and Skippett have dressed up as women and pretended to be Tempest, the Bogles agree that Dudley can marry her daughter only for Piper to reveal to them that he was Dudley's "love child" when he is not paid the blackmail money he demands. The wedding is saved, however, when a police inspector arrives and reveals that Piper's real father is not Dudley but rather Mr Bogle who had also had a fling with his mother in 1914.

Snowglobe (album)

Snowglobe is an EP by Jesca Hoop, self-released through Last Laugh records on March 7, 2011. It was recorded after the artist moved to Manchester, England, although the material was written largely prior to the move. It contains four new songs, supplemented by two acoustic renditions of previously released songs. The track 'City Bird' was released as a free download on January 26, 2011, while the album was followed by a UK tour.
Hoop described the experiences of living in downtown LA in ‘City Bird’ where she found that “the block I moved onto was lined with these cardboard houses and people sleeping in doorways", which was contrasted with “expresses my absolute love for home” in ‘While You Were Away’. A left-over from her previous album Hunting My Dress, the song ‘Snowglobe’ referred to her mother's funeral which she “would have put [...] the album to accompany the other two songs that I wrote for her, but the truth is that I could not sing it with out getting choked up”. The regular acapella curtain-closer for her live-shows, ‘Storms Make Grey the Sea’ was written "by the sea". Although describing them as folk songs, Hoop maintained that while "folk tends to go towards your intellect, also wants to tap into how your body relates to music".
Reception.
The album received some critical acclaim, with Drowned in Sound calling it "a concise but precise chapter in the Hoop story", while the NME described it as an 'deceptively opaque EP'. The Guardian explained that "musically at least, is simpler and starker. The focus is on Hoop's otherworldly voice (...) while cello and guitar wisp around her".

Facts.
Hollicourt was a construction company and it went insolvent in 1996. The Bank of Ireland, 31 King Street, Leeds, continued to operate its account, paying money in and out, for three months after because it missed (through human error) the notification of the winding up petition in the Gazette.
Blackburne J, applying dictra from Gray’s Inn held that the bank was liable to pay restitution for the money that had passed through its facility.
Judgment.
Mummery LJ for the court (Peter Gibson LJ and Latham LJ) held that Blackburne J was wrong. Only the final recipients, not the bank, were liable to repay the money. There was no unjust enrichment on the bank’s part, and no comparable restitution case could be found. The banking transactions ‘are merely part of the process by which dispositions of the company’s property are made.’
So property could be recovered from the payees only, but not the bank which acted as a simple agent in the transfer.

Beja Airport

Beja Airport (; ) is an unused Portuguese airport that opened doors to civilian flights on April 15, 2011.
Location.
Beja Airport, located northwest of Beja, is away from Lisbon, from Faro and less than from Spain. Beja (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈbɛʒɐ]) is a city in the Beja Municipality in the Alentejo Region, Portugal. The municipality has a total area of and a total population of 34,970 inhabitants. The city proper has a population of 21,658.
History.
An airbase was established on 21 October 1964, originally built to serve as a training facility for the West German Air Force, due to airspace limitations within West Germany. Until 1993 it was used particularly for weapons training, and in 1987 the Portuguese Air Force's 103 Squadron and its Lockheed T-33 and Northrop T-38 aircraft was relocated from Montijo. After their arrival, the base started to host a mixed array of fixed and rotary-wing trainers, as well as maritime patrol aircraft. The airbase has also served as one of the Space Shuttle landing sites.
Along with the airports in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Flores, Santa Maria, Ponta Delgada and Horta, the airport's concessions to provide support to civil aviation was conceded to ANA Aeroportos de Portugal on 18 December 1998, under provisions of decree 404/98. With this concession, ANA was also provided to the planning, development and construction of future infrastructures.
In 2011 a new civilian terminal was built and Beja became a dual-use military-civilian airport, aiming to attract low cost carriers. The inaugural flight to Praia, Cape Verde, took place on 13 April 2011. There were also charter flights to the United Kingdom.
In spite of being the only Portuguese airport in Alentejo—the biggest Portuguese region, with an area comparable to the size of Belgium—the airport failed to attract the attention of low-cost carriers and has never had any scheduled regular flights. As of September 2012, plans to reconvert it into cargo use are under discussion. It may possibly be a logistics platform between the goods that are shipped to the nearby Port of Sines and the whole of Europe. On September 2013, it was announced that Aigle Azur would start seasonal flights from Paris to the airport. As of September 2012, the future of the airport remains uncertain. The authorities are studying the possibility of reconverting the airport to cargo use.

Robert Wallis (engraver)

Robert Wallis (7 November 1794 – 23 November 1878) was an English line-engraver.
Life and work.
Wallis born in London, the son of Thomas Wallis, who was an assistant of Charles Heath (1785–1848) and died in 1839. He was taught by his father, and became one of the ablest of the group of supremely skilful landscape-engravers who flourished during the second quarter of the nineteenth century, particularly excelling in the interpretation of the work of Joseph Mallord William Turner. 
He engraved illustrations for Turner's "Picturesque Views on the Southern Coast of England" (with George Cooke), Turner's "England and Wales" and "Rivers of France", Charles Heath's "Picturesque Annual", Robert Jennings's ‘Landscape Annual’, the fine editions of the works of Walter Scott, Thomas Campbell, and Samuel Rogers, the "Keepsake", the "Amulet", the "Literary Souvenir", and many other beautiful publications. 
On a larger scale he engraved various plates for the "The Art Journal" from pictures by Turner, Callcott, Stanfield, Fripp, and others, and many for the "Turner Gallery". Wallis's finest productions are the large plates after Turner, "Lake of Nemi" and "Approach to Venice"; a proof of the latter was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1859, and on its completion he retired from the profession. The remainder of his life was passed at Brighton, where he died on 23 November 1878. 
Family.
Henry Wallis (1805?–1890), brother of Robert, practised for some years as an engraver of small book-illustrations, but early in life was compelled by attacks of paralysis to seek another occupation. He then turned to picture-dealing, and eventually became the proprietor of the "French Gallery" in Pall Mall, London, which he conducted successfully until shortly before his death, which occurred on 15 October 1890. 
Another brother, William Wallis, born in 1796, is known by a few choice plates executed for Jennings's ‘Landscape Annual,’ Heath's ‘Picturesque Annual,’ the ‘Keepsake,’ etc.

The Pregnant King

The Pregnant King is a book written by Devdutt Pattanaik. It follows the story of Yuvanashva, a childless king, who accidentally drinks the magic potion meant to make his queens pregnant. It is set in the backdrop of the Mahabaratha and makes references to characters and incidents in the Kurukshetra as well as the Ramayana.
Among the many lesser-known sub-stories in the Mahabharata is one told by the sage Lomasha to the exiled Pandavas, about a king named Yuvanashva who accidentally gets pregnant, later revealed that it was no accident but by design by the ghosts of 2 young boys who were burned alive by the King at the stake. For the author, Devdutt Pattanaik, a medical doctor, marketing consultant and mythologist deeply interested in the relevance of old myths in modern times, this was an instantly intriguing story. Pattanaik has written several books on myths and rituals already, but The Pregnant King is his first work of fiction, a retelling of the Yuvanashva tale to examine gender roles, the blurring of lines between parental duties and the malleability of Dharma to fit a given situation. 
The conflict between desire and social obligation/destiny is a major theme in the book as well as the very definition or question mark of/on Gender in physical sense.
Synopsis.
The chronology of events as recorded in the Mahabharata has been manipulated and the story of Yuvanashva, replete with characters churned out of the author’s imagination, has been woven in. The protagonist, King Yuvanashva is the well liked ruler of Vallabhi, an obedient son,a devoted husband who aspires to be just towards all and uphold Dharma in his kingdom. From the onset of the story, the epic battle of Kurukshetra is imminent but the king’s mother, Shilavati, refuses to give her consent since he’s yet to sire an heir. Despite having three wives and several years of futile rituals the king has reached a point of desperation. So he seeks the help of the two Siddhis, Yaja and Upayaja, who after an elaborate ritual create a potion meant for his queens but drinks it ‘accidentally’ and ends up pregnant himself. The incident is hidden from everyone including the child except the wives, Shilavati and Asanga, the healer. After given birth to son, Mandhata, he successfully impregnates his second wife, Pulomi. The king who has lived his whole life by the code of Dharma now finds himself in a dilemma. “I am not sure that I am a man…I have created life outside me as men do. But I have also created life inside me, as women do. What does that make me? Will a body such as mine fetter or free me?”
The irony of the whole story is that the king who is supposed to be the epitome of manhood and upholder of Dharma longs till his last breath to be called ‘mother’ just once by Mandhata. "What sounds sweetest, being called Mother or being called Father"?
The novel also delves into the stories of other characters like Shilavati, the ambitious and sharp princess who cannot be king because she’s a woman. Widowed at a young age she becomes the regent but this disturbs the Brahmin elders because “they were not used to a leader who nursed a child while discussing matters of dharma”. (It’s notable that the unconventionality of Shilavati’s own life doesn’t make her any more tolerant of her son’s situation later on, which underlines the point that non-conformity/anti-tradition can take many forms, and these aren’t always kindred spirits.) It also tells the story of Somvat and Sumedha, two childhood friends who decide to get married despite being men. Sthunakarna, a yaksha, who forsakes his manhood to make Shikhandi a husband and then reclaims it to make Somvat a wife. Arjuna, the great warrior with many wives forced to masquerade as a eunuch after being castrated by a nymph. Adi-natha, the teacher of teachers, worshipped as a hermit by Yaja and an enchantress by Upayaja. It’s also the story of the patron god of Vallabhi, Ileshwar Mahadev, who becomes God on full moon days and Goddess on new moon nights.
Critique.
Throughout the book, the author highlights the paradoxes and ambiguities of gender and thus, life. He also uses the shift in chronology to use episodes in the epic of Mahabharata as parallels or counterpoints for the Yuvanashva story. The characters in this book make chatty references to the lives of their more famous contemporaries in Hastinapur as mentioned in the Mahabhharata.
The question of whether the impotent Pandu and the blind Dhritrashtra were fit to become king is set against similar dilemmas involving characters in Vallabhi. There’s some healthy irreverence on view: when a messenger arrives with the momentous news that the war is over, no one in the kingdom is particularly interested, being more concerned about internal matters. When the hero Arjuna makes what amounts to a guest appearance and is asked about a story Bhishma narrated to the Pandavas before he died, his reply is a curt, “I’m sorry but I remember no such story. He said so many things” – a neat dismissal of the ponderous Shanti Parva, Bhishma’s long deathbed discourse about a king’s duties.
The story largely seems obsessed with the definition of gender, man? or women? does the flesh matter? What about the soul? It also talks about marriage and child birth. There are multiple references to bulls, fields, soil and seeds as euphemisms for sex and conception, and to illuminate the vexing question of “ownership” that arises when a woman is made pregnant by someone other than her husband. And then there are those troublesome dead ancestors, the “pitrs”, waiting for the arrival of a child so they can be reborn in the land of the living. Taking the form of crows, they perch outside bedchambers, waiting for quick results, flapping their wings impatiently when foreplay goes on for too long. (“Does it not bother you that your son’s seed is weak?” one of them indelicately asks Shilavati.)
The Pregnant King isn’t a consistently satisfying work – It keeps the reader interested for the larger part but at places it’s punctuated with staccato sentences (“That’s what they were. Vehicles of an idea. Two ideas. No. One idea, two expressions. Two halves of the same idea. Mutually interdependent”) that can annoy. The occasional forced attempt at informality, and some philosophical mumbo-jumbo towards the end (“Within you is your soul, Adi-natha as Shiva, silent, observant, still. Around you is matter, Adi-natha as Shakti, ever-changing, enchanting, enlightening, enriching, empowering”). Also, readers whose engagement with ancient texts runs along orthodox lines might not be too interested in a modern myth about the amorphous nature of the world and its laws. But in a sense, this book is meant for just such readers as the author hopes to make us realise that in the rush to deem situations Black or White, the vast expanse of grey needs to be acknowledged and dealt with as well. “The imperfection of the human condition and our stubborn refusal to make room for all those in between” is a cautionary tale for our own times. 
The result is a sporadically successful book that tells an engrossing, subversive story but meanders a little too much.

When the Killing's Done

"When the Killing's Done" is a 2011 novel by T. C. Boyle. The book is an environmental and family drama revolving around the Channel Islands of California—specifically Anacapa and Santa Cruz—and the controversy surrounding efforts by the National Park Service and its partners to eradicate invasive species and revitalize the islands' natural communities. 
The novel has substantial basis in historical occurrence. Native wildlife populations on the islands, both part of Channel Islands National Park, had been pushed toward extinction by a variety of invasive species, including the golden eagle, black rats, and feral pigs and sheep. In 2001 and 2002 the National Park Service used poison to successfully eradicate Anacapa Island's non-native black rats, and then partnered with other government agencies and the Nature Conservancy to remove feral pigs from Santa Cruz Island, which was completed in 2006.
In the novel, Dave Lajoy, an impassioned animal rights activist, leads an attempt to prevent NPS spokesperson and biologist Alma Boyd Takesue from removing rats and pigs from the islands. The novel also flashbacks to events on the islands during the 1940s and the 1970s.

Ligue trotskyste de France

The Ligue trotskyste de France is a French Trotskyist group. It is a section of the International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist) or "Spartacist" tendency.
The LTF was founded in the mid 1970s, reportedly after members of the Spartacist League (US) started proslytizating in France. The LTF campaigned against the Union of the Left during the French legislative election, 1978, considering the coalition a popular front. In the 1981 elections it offered the French Communist Party leader Georges Marchais "savagely critical support" if he ran against François Mitterrand. They later condemned him for keeping the PFC in the Union of the Left.
In 1980 the LTF launched a periodical, "Le Bolshevik" edited by William Cazenove. Through the 1980s the group continued to supported the positions of the international Spartacist movement, i.e., opposition to Solidarity, support of the Soviet war in Afghanistan and opposition to Khomeini.

Haitian people

Haitians (French: "haïtien", Haitian creole: "ayisyen") are the inhabitants or citizens of Haiti. A Haitian can be also a person born abroad to a Haitian parent or a foreigner living in Haiti who acquired Haitian citizenship.
Who is a Haitian?
According to the Constitution of Haiti, a Haitian citizen is:
Dual citizenship.
The Haitian Constitution of 2012 re-legalizes dual citizenship, allowing for Haitians living abroad to own land and run for Haitian political office (except for offices of president, prime minister, senator or member of the lower house of Parliament).
Origins.
The Creoles of Sonya Haiti and Haiti's Creole culture originate from a number of ethnic groups and social classes dating back to colonial times. French pirates, hunters, buccaneers and "habitants" made up the European component and as France made moves to colonize this part of the island Both Frenchmen and black Creoles (free and slave) settled on the Island coming from nearby Saint Christophe. These early settlers often intermarried forming Creole families with the pairings of a French father and a (free) Creole woman as the mother who bore mixed raced Creole children. The people of this time spoke a dialect of French referred to as "patois" (later "créole") and often worked the land of Haïti (then "Saint-Domingue") to produce things like indigo and cacao with which they had great success. The success of these industries attracted more colonists from France to cross the Atlantic and settle in Saint-Domingue. It also opened up trade with foreign powers. As less Europeans desired to work and instead preferred to take part in the success of the colony's industries the French turned towards importing slaves from Africa; something they learned from the Dutch. Even in these times successful Creoles of color flourished in some cases they fared even better than White Creoles. Racial tensions developed between these groups of people as Creoles of color fought for even more rights but white Creoles felt that their connection to France made them better than the Creoles of color who were connected to the people they imported from Africa to work as slaves. Despite racial tension and the Code Noir French Men continued to have sexual relations with women of color (both free and slave). Frenchmen slept with many of their female slaves most of them formed relationships with certain female slaves (who they often made housekeeper) and the man usually took responsibility for the children he fathered with this kept woman eventually freeing her and their children. The contrast of the two types of sexual relationships that occurred between the French colonists and his female slaves are that often the man had sex with his slaves simply for sexual pleasure due to the lack of French female colonists during that time or for the production of more slaves. In the case of the kept woman, the Frenchman was often attracted to this woman.
Under the harsh living and labor conditions slaves in "Saint-Domingue" rarely survived more than ten years. Because of this the French were continuously importing African slaves to work the land and to learn various other crafts, adding to the luxury of slave owners who were mostly Frenchmen or white Creoles but many Creoles of color too owned slaves during these times; These free Creoles of color where often the offspring of Frenchmen or white Creoles and the kept or ex-kept black Creole women of these men. Slaves (both African & Creole) greatly outnumbered Frenchmen, white Creoles and free Creoles of color who were the next rising majority. The majority of Haitians today are the descendants of these slaves who became creolized and bore Creole children. Mixed race Haitians are typically descended from White Creoles and Black Creoles. They are often of French and African descent but some may also be descended from the various other Europeans who settled in Saint-Domingue to take part in Saint-Domingue's wealth as well as from the Polish soldiers who were allowed to stay in Haiti after the revolution in reward for helping fight the French (Polish soldiers fought on both sides; those who fought for Haiti were granted this privilege). A small and unknown number of Haitians are descendants from African maroons and Taino Indians. Maroon slaves often fled to the mountains to escape Europeans and there they were welcomed by the some of the remaining Taino Indians. The Africans passed down the culture of the Tainos to the Haitians of today from their interaction with them and some of them intermarried creating a new race of people known as "marabouts".
Ethnic groups.
Haiti is a multi-ethnic nation, home to people of different ethnic and national backgrounds who were West Central Africas, mulattoes (a mixture of European and African), Poles (Polish legion), Jews (arriving from the Polish legion and during the Holocaust), Arabs (from the Arab diaspora), Chinese, Indians, Germans (18th century and World War I), Italians, French and native Taino influences who are native to the country of Haiti, in the west of the island of Hispaniola.
Overview.
90-95% percent of Haitians are of African descent. 80-85% of these are mostly of mixed African descent and other racial make-up. "Sacatras", also known in Creole as "brin", are heavily of African descent. They have a dark brown skin complexion and heavy African features. "Griffes" are the offspring of "Mulâtres" and "Noirs". They may be marked by brown or chestnut skin color lighter than that of a "Sacatra". They may have African features that may have been smoothed out a little. "Griffes" are known in common Creole as "Marron". During colonial times when races first began intermixing in "Saint-Dominque" labels where given by exact genetic make-up but in modern Haiti many mixed raced people intermixed over generations so the exact genetic make-up of a person is often hard to keep track of. Racial labeling is often designated by skin color and hair type. 20-30% of Haiti’s population is of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. The majority of this population is of mixed race, these Haitians have heavier European features. Racial groups that carry such features in Haiti are: "mulâtres" ("milâte" in Creole), "grimauds", "jaunes" and "roses". "Mulâtres" vary in skin color. The defining features of a "Mulâtre" is his or her loosely coiled or straight hair and their fair skin complexion (although a dark skinned person who has loosely coiled or straight hair may also be called "milâte"). "Grimauds" are solely marked by their fair skin while "jaunes" have a fairer complexion than the "grimauds". ‘’Roses’’ have the fairest complexion of all people of African descent and look mostly European. The only thing that separates "grimauds", "jaunes" and "roses" from being "mulâtre" is that they do not have loosely coiled nor straight hair. 20-30% are the ‘’marabouts’’ and their descendants. ‘’marabouts’’ are the descendants of African maroons, Taino Indians and/or East Indians. Their descendants may also have European blood. They are marked by Dark skin and long black loosely coiled or straight hair as well as European and/or Taino facial features.

Languages.
The official language of Haiti is French but also speak Haitian Creole. All Haitians speak Haitian Creole, while only about 30% of the population are considered to be bilingual in French and Haitian Creole. About 70% of the population speaks Haitian Creole only.
Traditionally, the two languages served different functions, with Haitian Creole the informal everyday language of all the people, regardless of social class, and French the language of formal situations: schools, newspapers, the law and the courts, and official documents and decrees. However, because the vast majority of Haitians speak only Creole, there have been efforts in recent years to expand its uses. In 1979, a law was passed that permitted Creole to be the language of instruction, and the Constitution of 1983 gave Creole the status of a national language. However, it was only in 1987 that the Constitution granted official status to Creole.
Attitudes toward French and Haitian Creole have been slow to change, however. Ever since colonial times, fluency in French has served as an indicator of social class. Since only whites and educated mulatto freedmen spoke French in colonial times, knowledge of French became the distinguishing trait between those who had been free before the Revolution and those who had only recently acquired freedom; and it ensured the superior status of the mulattoes.

Helena Wong (weightlifter)

Helena Wong Kar Mun (born 11 April 1988; simplified Chinese:黄嘉汶; pinyin: "Huáng Jiāwèn") is a Singapore weightlifter. Wong competes in the female 53 kg weight class. She debuted at the 2010 Commonwealth Games which was held in Delhi in Oct 2010. She made history at the Games by becoming the first ever woman weightlifter to be selected by Singapore to take part in a major athletic event. She was placed 8th at the Games, her first international competition.
Early life and education.
Wong is the elder of the two siblings in her family. Wong attended Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus Toa Payoh School for her primary and secondary education. She was active in sports since young. She represented her school in judo and was a house captain in her upper secondary years. In her late teens, Wong decided to specialise in sports and in 2005, she opted to study sports at Nanyang Polytechnic.
Wong continued her sports specialisation into her undergraduate studies by choosing to focus in sports despite her equally keen interest towards business and economics. She gave up offers to study business and economics in Singapore’s local universities and ventured overseas to study sport science in England’s Loughborough University in autumn 2008. Wong graduated in June/July 2011 with a bachelor’s degree in Sports and Exercise Science from the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences.
As of August 2012, Wong is a sports lecturer with the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). She was previously ITE's scholar under their Associate cum Scholarship Scheme.
Sporting career.
Wong took up weightlifting by chance. She joined the gym in her university to keep fit and to escape the cold of her hostel room. Wong started off self-coaching from the internet and books from June 2009 to February 2010 after being introduced to the sport by UK Athletics strength and conditioning coach Thomas Yule.
She met Cyril Martin, a senior weightlifting coach with British Weightlifting (BWL) at the English Weightlifting Championships held at Lilleshall in February 2010 and started training under his guidance soon after at Atlas Workout Warehouse in Alfreton, Derbyshire. Wong credits Martin’s tutelage for her selection by the Singapore National Olympic Council to represent Singapore at the 2010 Commonwealth Games within a year after getting into the sport. Wong ""didn't really believe it"" when Singapore National Olympic Council selected her to represent the sport and the country as she was just a beginner.
SNOC Secretary-General, Chris Chan remarked that, "We took note of steady improvement and thought she would benefit from this New Delhi outing. Her participation would also give weightlifting a welcome boost as the sport enjoys a revival in Singapore." Similarly, Tom Liaw, President of Singapore Weightlifting Federation believes that weightlifters like Wong are contributing to the revival of the sport in Singapore since it was last represented in the 1986 Commonwealth Games. Liaw believes that "participation in major competitions like the Commonwealth Games is the next step to raising the profile of [weightlifting" in Singapore. Wong finished the Games with a total of 146 kg (Snatch:66 kg; Clean & Jerk:80 kg) "a commendable 8th" for her debut international outing.
In August 2011, Wong embarked on a 3-month training stint in Zhuhai Sport Institute in Zhuhai, China to better prepare her for the 26th SEA Games held in Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia in November 2011. Wong was the only representative for weightlifting and the first Singapore women to compete in weightlifting in the biennial competition. Wong faced tough competitors in the 53 kg category, meeting Thailand’s top lifter and the 2008 Olympic (53 kg) champion, Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarkoon who won with a total of 205 kg. Wong finished sixth out of nine lifters, making a total of 153 kg (70 kg snatch, 83 clean-and-jerk). Wong had bettered her previous performance set at the 2010 Commonwealth Games by 7 kg.

Santa's Village (Jefferson, New Hampshire)

Santa's Village is a Christmas-themed amusement park located in Jefferson, New Hampshire, United States.
Most of the 16 rides have Christmas or winter-themed names, such as "Rudy's Rapid Transit Coaster" and "The Great Humbug Adventure". The rides are designed for families with children under age 13. There are also three theatres, two of which present live shows and a third that features a 3-D movie called "A Tinkerdoodle Christmas". Visitors can visit Santa's home, lie in his bed, sit in his chair, and have a picture taken with Santa.
History and attractions.
Santa's Village was the brainchild of Normand and Cecile Dubois who, in the early 1950s, wanted to create something novel to their region. Seeing deer crossing the road sparked Norman's belief that the North Country in New Hampshire would serve well as Santa and his reindeers' home. On Father's Day, in 1953, the family amusement park was opened for the first time to the general public. In its first year, the park had pony rides and showcased Francis the Famous Mule in a mule performance. The amusement park staff frequently gave her oats from a whiskey bottle to wheedle her to move. The Duboises also invited to the park Santa Claus who was accompanied by real reindeer and numerous elves. The park was later englarged to include a "Santa Schoolhouse", a "Blacksmith Shop", "Santa's Workshop" and a chapel. In 1955, the park was open from June to October.
By 1969, the park also had playgrounds, restaurants, and a "Jingle Jamboree". The Dubois family added a dancing chicken and rabbit performance to the park's activities. By 1974, the Dubois' son-in-law, Michael Gaynor, took over the park's management after the couple retired. The admission for people over four years old in 1974 was $3. Peggy Newland of the "The Nashua Telegraph" wrote in 2010 that "y the 1980s, the park had grown to a 'real' amusement park". The park was further expanded, with a "Yule Log Flume" that glided down a Christmas-themed river, carrying people around the park. Macaws performed in the park, roller-skating around the stage and balancing bikes on a tightrope.
In 1986, Jack Barth of "Spy" wrote that Santa's Village has a "strange arrangement", in that to take pictures, people poke their heads out of a cake made of plaster. The grandchildren of Normand and Cecile Dubois manage the park. They added a "Polar Theater" with 3D shows that include elves that dance and a tree that sings, as well as "Skyways Sleighs", which transport people through the sky to different parts of the park.
Near the park's duck pond is a life-size Nativity scene. The park also has a wishing well, where children can make a wish and toss coins in. The money from the wishing well is given to marginalized children through the form of Christmas gifts. In the first year of the Village, more than $1000 from the well was used to buy gifts for marginalized children.
Admission for the 2011 season is US$26 per person, $23 for seniors over 62 but children 4 and under are free.
Mick Foley wrote in his autobiography "The Hardcore Diaries" that he has a Christmas fixation and that "every good thing in my life somehow leads me back to Jefferson, New Hampshire, and the trip to Santa's Village my parents took me on when I was only three years old". In his list of top ten amusement parks, Foley placed Santa's Village first, writing that "hat it lacks in rides, it makes up for in personal nostalgia, a beautiful location, and the magic of Christmas in the summer".

Half Broke Horses

Half Broke Horses is a 2009 novel by Jeannette Walls detailing the life of her grandmother, Lily Casey Smith.
Summary.
"Half Broke Horses" is the story of Lily Casey Smith’s life. Author Jeannette Walls, the granddaughter of Lily Casey Smith, wrote the book from Lily’s point of view. Lily is portrayed as a strong, spirited, and resourceful woman, who overcomes poverty and tragedy with the positive attitude that “When God closes a window, he opens a door. But it’s up to you to find it.” As a child growing up on the frontier in Texas, Lily learns how to break horses. At the age of fifteen, she rides five hundred miles, alone, to get to her job as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse. Later in life, Lily runs a vast cattle ranch in Arizona, along with her second husband and their two children. A woman of many talents, Lily earns extra money at various points in her life by playing poker, selling bootleg liquor, and riding in horse races. She also tries to fight injustice and prejudice wherever she finds it, which occasionally lands her in trouble. "Half Broke Horses" depicts the freedom of rural life, its joys and struggles, and celebrates the courage and spirit of its protagonist. Jeannette Walls says the book is “in the vein of an oral history, a retelling of stories handed down by my family through the years, and undertaken with the storyteller’s traditional liberties.”
Reception.
In The New York Times Book Review, critic Liesl Schillinger wrote, "Through the adventures of Lily Casey — mustang breaker, schoolteacher, ranch wife, bootlegger, poker player, racehorse rider, bush pilot and mother of two — Walls revisits the adrenaline-charged frontier background that gave her own mother a lifelong taste for vicissitude. 'I’m an excitement addict,' Rose Mary Walls liked to tell her children. And yet — can the contours of one woman’s life ever sufficiently explain the life that proceeds from hers? Rose Mary eventually found an anchor in the form of her daughter — the third generation of a line of indomitable women whose paths she has inscribed on the permanent record, enriching the common legend of our American past." Critic Janet Maslin wrote of Jeannette Walls in The New York Times, "She has managed to make her second book almost as inviting as her first, even though its upright heroine is never as startling as Ms. Walls’s parents were."

Wild Arctic

Wild Arctic is a motion simulator and film themed attraction currently operating at SeaWorld Orlando and SeaWorld San Diego. The attraction is combined with an animal exhibit featuring beluga whales, polar bears, and walruses. This attraction replaced Mission Bermuda Triangle at SeaWorld Orlando.
Guests have the option to "travel by land" and bypass the motion simulator aspect of this attraction via stationary seating.
The ride was manufactured by Reflectone.
Attraction summary.
Entrance.
Guests queue outside the "Franklin Exploration Center", where it is presumed that they are waiting to board a helicopter which will taken them to "Base Station: Wild Arctic". The queue outside the attraction includes numerous murals of the Arctic animals and scenery as well as various HD TV monitors that show various clips about the Arctic and its animals running on a loop. Guests then enter the show building.
Gate Boarding Rooms.
Once inside the building, guests are divided into either traveling by helicopter (the ride portion) or traveling by foot / walking (in which they view the ride film without the motion). Guests who require stationary seating are taken directly to a Gate Boarding Room B where they view the ride film and then the interactive animal exhibit.
Guests experiencing the actual ride are taken into a room with an information board showing the flight departure schedule, as well as a large projection screen in front of them which shows another random clip about facts of the Arctic. From here, guests enter the pre-flight boarding station where they line up into multiple rows to prepare for their helicopter flight. Soon, a video comes on the screen in which the Operations Coordinator for the Franklin Exploration Center explains that the center is a support facility for Base Station Wild Arctic, and that both facilities were founded by Thomas Purcell in 1937, who strived to have man survive in the Arctic climate to research the area. The Coordinator further explains that guests will be traveling to Base Station Wild Arctic in the Helicopter White Thunder. A brief restriction spiel is played before she then turns the show over to Co-Pilot Norm "Snowman" Miller. Miller begins to explain that the White Thunder is being piloted by Captain Emerson, but is interrupted by White Thunder's computer, which warns of a severe arctic storm in their path. Miller then explains the safety rules to guests, and ends the video. The doors to White Thunder then open, and guests board the ride vehicle via a drawbridge-style ramp.
Ride.
Once guest have been seated and secured seat belts, the doors close, and Captain Emerson begins departing White Thunder from the Franklin Exploration Center, explaining to guests that he expects a short, comfortable flight to Base Station "Wild Arctic". Soon, Emerson begins flying the helicopter down to observe a polar bear family and then pilots White Thunder to switch to a water mode to dive into the Arctic waters to observe some Narwhals. Soon after the helicopter is piloted above water again, where Emerson warns that the Arctic storm is picking up and he has a warning indicator on his computer. Emerson lands the helicopter on a glacier to check the problem, which soon begins breaking apart due to the weight of the jet. Emerson struggles to get the engine to start, and the helicopter is soon caught in a rock slide before it begins flying again. The computer then dies out, and Emerson decides to use a short-cut to Base Station Wild Arctic to avoid the storm. Soon, White Thunder is caught in an avalanche and ice flow until Emerson narrowly escapes the storm by piloting through a narrow cavern, and to safety. The jet then arrives at Base Station Wild Arctic, and Emerson thanks guests and bids them farewell as they explore the research station. The doors then open, and guests exit the ride into Base Station Wild Arctic.
Post-Show & Exhibit.
Following the ride, guests enter Base Station Wild Arctic, which consists of a re-created Arctic Research Station built around two sailing ships which are trapped in the ice. Numerous animals can be seen on exhibit at the base, including beluga whales, polar bears and walruses. There are also multiple interactive cameras and activities scattered throughout the station. At the end of the attraction, guests exit through a long series of ramps.
Gift Shop.
Following this area, is a gift shop for the attraction where arctic-themed and SeaWorld-themed merchandise can be purchased.

Also including in the park are the Cayos Zapatillas ("Shoe Cays"). Resembling a pair of shoes, these two islands serve as a refugee for coral reefs, mammals, reptiles and birds, but also a nesting place for sea turtles. Named after the Zapatillas fruit, the park has been managed and protected by ANAM since its creation in 1988. The Cayos Zapatillas are the most popular place to visit this park.

Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd

Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd 2 BCLC 180 is a UK company law case, concerning the meaning of a shadow director. Often incorrectly cited in numerous sources as "Re:Hydrodan"
Facts.
There were two corporate directors of a parent company of Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Landsaver MCP Ltd, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Midland City Partnerships Ltd, which was, finally, a wholly owned subsidiary of Eagle Trust plc, a TV conglomerate chaired by David James, Baron James of Blackheath. The liquidator alleged that the two directors of Eagle Trust, Leslie Thomas and Dr Hardwick, were liable for wrongful trading, and contended they were liable as shadow directors under the Companies Act 2006 section 251.
Judgment.
Millett J held the directors of the parent were not shadow directors of the subsidiary, just by being members of the parent company’s board. It would need to be shown that they personally instructed and directed the subsidiary’s board. The first step is to identify the de jure and de facto directors, then to say that they had been directed, then that the real directors acted in accordance with the directions, and then that they were accustomed to do so. For instance there must be a pattern ‘in which the board did not exercise any discretion or judgment of its own but acted in accordance with the directions of others’. De facto directors are those who ‘undertook functions in relation to the company which could properly be discharged only by a director. It is not sufficient to show that he was concerned in the management of the company’s affairs or undertook tasks in relation to its business which can properly be performed by a manager below board level.’

Walter Auffenberg

Walter Auffenberg ( – ) was an American biologist who spent almost 40 years in field research, studying reptile and amphibian paleontology and the systematics and biology of numerous reptile species, including alligators and Komodo dragons.
Early life.
Auffenberg was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1928. After graduating High School he relocated to DeLand, Florida to work on two small citrus groves owned by his parents. Shortly after, he enlisted in the US Navy and trained as a Hospital Corpsman in Corpus Cristi, Texas. Upon his discharge he returned to Florida and attended Stetson University in DeLand, receiving his Bachelor of Science in Zoology in 1951. He moved to Gainesville, Florida to obtain his advanced degrees at the University of Florida.
Academic life.
Auffenberg received his M.Sc. from the University of Florida in 1953 with his thesis A Study of Geographic Morphological Variation in the Blacksnake. He held a temporary position as Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at The Charleston Museum in 1954 and a Special Student in Paleontology at Harvard University in 1955–56; obtaining his doctoral degree at the University of Florida in 1956. He wrote his dissertation on the fossil snakes of Florida.
In 1959 he and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado to assist his former adviser, Arnold Grobman to start up the innovative and popular high school science program Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS). Missing time in the field, Auffenberg returned to Gainesville, Florida, the University of Florida in 1963 to assume the role of Chairman of the Natural Sciences Department and Curator of Herpetology at the Florida Museum of Natural History (then the Florida State Museum). He remained as chairman until 1971 when he stepped down to concentrate on research.
Auffenberg retired as Curator of Herpetology in 1991 and was named Emeritus Distinguished Service Professor/Curator.
In 1969, Auffenberg and his family moved to Komodo Island for 11 months so Auffenberg could study the Komodo dragon in its natural habitat. During their stay, Auffenberg, his family and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons. The research from the Auffenberg expedition would prove to be influential in the future propagation of Komodo dragons in captivity.
Auffenberg authored over 130 books and papers during his lifetime including his work on the herpetology of Pakistan, which produced one of the world's largest collections of reptiles and amphibians from Pakistan. He is most famous for "The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor" in 1981, for which he received the Best Wildlife Book Award from The Wildlife Society. Several living and fossil species, including the Peacock monitor ("Varanus auffenbergi") were named for him. "Advances in Monitor Research II", the proceedings of a symposium on monitor lizards held in 1997, is dedicated to Auffenberg "in recognition of his outstanding contributions to monitor lizard biology".

Heinz Ebert

Heinz Ebert (Saxony, Germany, October 13, 1907, – 1983, Rio Claro, São Paulo) was a German-Brazilian geologist, naturalist, and educator. 
Ebert had his basic training in chemistry, physics, and analytical chemistry and natural sciences and served as geologist at the Geological Survey of Prussia. He was obtained his PhD at the University of Leipzig, where he became an associate professor in 1934. He worked on petrography at the Geological Survey of Saxony and developed methods to recognize stratigraphic sequences by petrographic and structural analysis. From 1939 to 1946, World War II interrupted his geological activity. After the war he returned to geology and opened an office for applied geology (groundwater, drilling, economic geology, geology for dams, etc.) 
He moved to Recife in 1950 and was influential in creating the CAGE (Campaign for Training Geologists). From 1950 to 1956, he was a "specialized geologist" at the Division of Geology and Mineralogy, which evolved from the old Geological Survey of Brazil, and mapped the regions of São João del Rei, Juiz de Fora, and Barbacena, a whole complex metasedimentary southern region of Minas Gerais. He was director of Sudene, training technicians in areas of groundwater in crystalline rocks.
In 1962 he moved to Rio Claro, São Paulo, to teach various subjects in the field of geosciences at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of the Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio de Mesquita Filho, assisting in the creation of the geology course. He continued his studies with attention to the south and southwest of the state of Minas Gerais. He made several trips abroad, bringing to Brazil contributions of his observations and contacts. He had many students, many of them becoming professors and continuing his work, especially in teaching mineralogy, petrology, structural geology, and the creation and maintenance of the Museum of Minerals and Rocks "Heinz Ebert". This museum has a vast collection that Ebert donated, including many didactic collections.
Ebert formed in Recife more graduate students. He published around 60 works on geosciences, especially of Brazil. Between 1977 and 1980 he also collaborated with the course of geology at the Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso.
In 1974, Ebert won the Jose Bonifacio Gold Medal of the Sociedade Brasileira de Geologia, the highest prize in Brazilian geology.
As a naturalist, Ebert had a passion for butterfly collection. He died in 1983, in Rio Claro, Brazil.

Long Island Veterinary Specialists

ets
Long Island Veterinary Specialists is a veterinary specialty center located in Plainview, Long Island, New York
. LIVS was first located in Levittown, NY and was previously called “Island Veterinary Referral.” Dr. Meyer Kaplan, veterinary surgeon and owner of Levittown Animal Hospital, and Dr. John Sapienza, veterinary ophthalmologist, formed Island Veterinary Referral in 1993. Dr. Dominic J. Marino, veterinary surgeon, and Dr. Rada Panich, veterinary dermatologist, joined Island Veterinary Referral the same year. In June 1998, Island Veterinary Referral changed their name to Long Island Veterinary Specialists. At the time, LIVS was Long Island’s first veterinary specialist center with a CT scanner and a fully equipped emergency and critical care center. The Center at LIVS contains an active Neurology/Neurosurgery department and one of the only “electronic brachytherapy” treatment facility for pet cancer.
Among the noteworthy accomplishments of Long Island Veterinary Specialists is their work with Canine Chiari - Like Malformation & Syringomyelia. The clinicians at Long Island Veterinary Specialists have made advances in the diagnosis and medical management of pets with CM as well as other abnormalities of the craniocervical junction. Some of these advances are made possible using MR imaging to evaluate and the development of a thermal camera-based screening test.
Before the introduction of MRI, CM and SM were commonly confused with allergic skin disorders, disk disease, ear infections and epilepsy. After CM was reported in human patients, the initial research was provided for the diagnosis of animals.
On July 13, 2012, Dr. Dominic J. Marino, Chief of Staff at Long Island Veterinary Specialists was featured in a NY Times feature story for hosting and conducting a two-day combat training course for the Air Force Pararescuers from the USAF (United States Air Force)/NYANG (New York Air National Guard), and their service canines. The training session, spanning two days at the LIVS facility consisted of lectures, demonstration labs, and tactical drills to teach pararescuers how to treat canines in crisis situations.

The 2011–12 season was the 107th overall season of football and the 74th season of competitive professional football in France.
The men's French national team began play on 10 August 2011 contesting a friendly match against Chile. The team will continue its qualification matches for the upcoming UEFA Euro 2012. The men's youth international teams also began playing qualification matches for their yearly European Championship tournament. "Les Espoirs" began its qualification campaign for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, while
the under-19 and under-17 teams will play qualification matches for the 2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship and 2011 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship, respectively. Similarly, the women began their qualification campaign for UEFA Women's Euro 2013.
News.
Coupe de France final date change.
In February 2011, it was reported by the French media that the French Football Federation had scheduled the 2011–12 edition of the Coupe de France final to be played on 5 May 2012. The date is significant because it would mark the 20th anniversary of the Furiani disaster, which occurred when a tribune at the Stade Armand Cesari in Furiani collapse during a Coupe de France semi-final match between SC Bastia and Marseille. The tragedy resulted in the death of 18 individuals and injuries to over 2,000. The resulting outcry and criticism of the decision to schedule the final on that date led to the Federation issuing a statement declaring that the official calendar for the competition had not been released, so the reports were only rumors. On 31 March 2011, the schedule was released and the date for the final was set for 28 April 2012.
Supercup in Morocco.
On 15 April 2011, the Ligue de Football Professionnel announced that, for the third consecutive season, the Trophée des champions will be held on international soil. The match will be played in Tanger, Morocco at the recently completed Stade de Tanger and will be contested by the winner of Ligue 1 and the winner of the Coupe de France. The match will be played on either 27 July 2011. Like the previous two years, the idea will be to promote French football abroad, but this time more specifically in Africa and the Arab world.
New FFF president.
On 18 June 2011, following an election, Federal Council member Noël Le Graët was named as the federation's 12th president after winning almost 55% of the vote. Le Graët defeated the incumbent Fernand Duchaussoy and third candidate Eric Thomas, the former receiving 45% of the vote, while the latter took in only .19% of the vote.
DNCG rulings.
Ligue 2.
On 1 July 2011, following a preliminary review of each club's administrative and financial accounts in the Championnat National, the DNCG ruled that Tours would be relegated to the Championnat National. Tours president, Frédéric Sebag, confirmed the demotion was as a result of the club's failure to "balance its books". Sebag also confirmed that the club would be appealing the ruling. On 13 July, Tours successfully appealed to the DNCG and was, subsequently, reinstated into Ligue 2.
National.
On 26 May 2011, following a preliminary review of each club's administrative and financial accounts in the Championnat National, the DNCG ruled that Pacy Vallée-d'Eure, Strasbourg, Gap, Grenoble, and Cannes would be relegated to the Championnat de France amateur after the organization determined that the club's were enduring financial difficulties. The clubs had the option to appeal the ruling. On 24 June 2011, Pacy Vallée-d'Eure officials confirmed in a press conference that it would accept its relegation to the fourth division in an effort to smooth over its €350,000 debt into next year. Two weeks later, Grenoble confirmed on its website that the Appeals Board of the DNCG had informed club officials that it will be relegated to the fourth division. Grenoble, subsequently, entered liquidation on 7 July. On 13 July, Grenoble's relegation was validated after the French Football Federation confirmed via letter to SAS Épinal that the club would be replacing Grenoble in the Championnat National.
On 8 July 2011, the Appeals Board of the DNCG confirmed that both Strasbourg and Gap would remain relegated after the clubs failed to convince the board of its intent to fix its financial liabilities. Strasbourg has a deficit of over €4 million, while Gap's debt has exceeded over €80,000. Following the appeal denial, Gap officials announced that the club would appeal to the CNOSF, the National Sporting Committee of France. On 18 July, despite both clubs still having the option to appeal the DNCG rulings, the Ligue du Football Amateur (LFA) announced that Red Star and Cherbourg would replace Strasbourg and Gap, respectively, for the 2011–12 edition of the Championnat National. On the following day, Cannes had its appeal to remain in the Championnat National rejected by the DNCG. Similar to Gap, following the decision, Cannes announced its intent to appeal the ruling at the CNOSF. On 29 July, the CNOSF gave a favorable ruling for Cannes recommending to the federation that Cannes should remain in the third division. On 3 August, the CNOSF ruled Gap confirmed the demotion of Gap to the Championnat de France amateur. The French Football Federation determined whether Cannes would be allowed to participate in the league on 4 August, one day before the season was set to begin at the federation's annual executive meeting. At the meeting, the Federation re-affirmed its decision to relegate Cannes to the CFA stating it "trust the DNCG and followed its decisions".
CFA.
On 26 May 2011, following a preliminary review of each club's administrative and financial accounts in the Championnat National, the DNCG ruled that Pacy Vallée-d'Eure, Strasbourg, Gap, Grenoble, and Cannes would be relegated to the Championnat de France amateur (CFA) after the organization determined that the clubs were enduring financial difficulties. The organization also excluded Toulon from participating in the CFA and relegated both Agde and Chambéry to the fifth division. On 4 June, the DNCG announced that, for the second consecutive season, Calais would not be allowed to ascend to the CFA. All clubs had the option to appeal the rulings.
On 24 June 2011, Pacy Vallée-d'Eure officials confirmed in a press conference that it would accept its relegation to the fourth division in an effort to smooth over its €350,000 debt into next year. Two weeks later, on 4 July, Grenoble confirmed on its website that the Appeals Board of the DNCG had informed club officials that it will be relegated to the fourth division. Grenoble, subsequently, entered liquidation on 7 July, which made the club unable to participate in the CFA. On the same day as the Grenoble ruling, the DNCG also rejected the appeals of Toulon and Calais. On 8 July 2011, the Appeals Board of the DNCG confirmed that both Strasbourg and Gap would remain relegated after the clubs failed to convince the board of its intent to fix its financial liabilities.

<doc id="31205078" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31205078" title="Liquid Impact Forming">
Liquid Impact Forming

Liquid Impact Forming is a metalworking process in which the combined use of a stamping press and a liquid medium forms the desired shape on the workpiece. This technique is a synthesis of two metalworking processes; stamping (metalworking) and hydroforming. It is especially suited for the cold forming of tubular structural parts in automotive, railroad and aerospace industries.
The process is based on a patent by Stanley Ash from the Greenville Tool & Die Company in Greenville, Michigan.
Process.
Liquid impact forming uses the principles of hydroforming process with conventional stamping equipment. Even though hydroforming offers great advantages over conventional tube stamping through the reduction of manufacturing steps and the reduction of variation in workpieces, it still requires expensive mechanical equipment such as dies to withstand extreme pressures and pressurizing equipment such as pumps and intensifiers. As an alternative to this, the liquid impact forming utilizes the increase in the internal pressure of the liquid inside of a tube during the stamping process, eliminating the need for the use of above mentioned equipment.
The process includes the following stages:
1. A metal tube is filled with a liquid, preferably water and placed between lower and upper die sections of stamping dies.
2. The ends of the liquid-filled tube are sealed to confine the liquid within the tube at approximately atmospheric pressure.
3. The liquid-filled sealed tube is stamped in a conventional die to form the tube into a desired configuration, such as a box-shaped structural member. The compressive forces produced as the die closes to form stamped tube also compress the liquid within the interior of the sealed tube as it changes shape. Thus, the pressure of the liquid increases as the die closes. As the liquid resists compression, it forces the tube walls outwardly toward the interior surface of the die cavity. Once die sections are fully closed around the sealed tube, the tube walls take the shape of the die cavity.
4. The remaining liquid is drained from the formed tube.
Applications and Variations.
The liquid impact forming process is especially advantageous for the cold forming of tubular structural parts in automotive, railroad and aerospace industries. It may be used in the cold forming of cylindrical or non-cylindrical parts. It is limited for the applications requiring extensive metal flow or bulging because of the absence of external pressure utilization as in hydroforming. 
One further variation of the liquid impact forming comprises the use of a change-of-state material in liquid state in order to prevent the tube wall from buckling or wrinkling during piercing. The change-of-state material can be water or a metallic lead-bismuth alloy. The liquid can be frozen before the stamping phase. After stamping, the liquid can be melted and drained from the shaped tube. Other applications of the process would be the piercing or bulging of tubes, which could also include the use of the change-of-state material.

The Outlaws of Mars is a science fiction novel by Otis Adelbert Kline in the planetary romance subgenre pioneered by Edgar Rice Burroughs. It was originally serialized in seven parts in the magazine "Argosy" beginning in November 1933. It was first published in book form in 1961 in hardcover by Avalon Books in 1961; the first paperback edition was issued by Ace Books in the same year. Later trade paperback editions were published by Pulpville Press in November 2007 and Paizo Publishing in May 2009.
The novel is a semi-sequel to Kline's earlier "Swordsman of Mars", as the setting is the same and the two books have some characters in common.
Plot.
Jerry Morgan, a man with no future on Earth, is offered a new life on Mars. He starts out on the wrong foot, meeting a princess and killing the fearsome-looking Martian beast he takes to be menacing her, which actually turns out to be her pet. From there Morgan becomes entangled in the politics of the Byzantine Martian royal court, spurns the advances of a would-be lover, escapes his hosts and role as an expendable political pawn. Various adventures follow, with dazzling swordplay, feats of strength, and other trials, tribulations and treacheries.
Kline's Mars has multiple parallel canals, surrounded by walls and terraces, and the construction of the canals by Martian machines is described. The story has a race-war element that may jar the modern reader.

New Provinces (poetry anthology)

New Provinces: Poems of Several Authors was an anthology of Canadian poetry published in the 1930s, anonymously edited by F. R. Scott assisted by Leo Kennedy and A. J. M. Smith. The first anthology of Canadian modernist poetry, it has been hailed as a "landmark anthology" and a "milestone selection of modernist Canadian verse". 
History.
Kennedy, Scott, Smith, and fellow Montreal poet A. M. Klein were all members of the Montreal Group of poets centred around that city's McGill University in the 1920s and early 1930s. Smith and Scott had co-edited the "McGill Fortnightly Review"; Kennedy and Klein were respectively editors of the "Review"'s successor journals, the "Canadian Mercury" and the "McGilliad". The four poets began assembling an anthology of poetry in 1931, and in 1934 invited Toronto poets Robert Finch and E. J. Pratt to join them. 
Scott and Smith disagreed over also inviting Toronto poet Dorothy Livesay. "Smith twice explicitly suggested to Scott that Livesay’s poetry be included in the volume. On both occasions Scott refused, saying that Livesay’s work would be appropriate for a second, 'more political' edition of "New Provinces" at a later date." (Scott was a founder of the social democratic Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, while Livesay was a member of the Communist Party of Canada.) Much later, though, Livesay told an interviewer that Scott had wanted to include her work, and that it was Pratt who had vetoed it. 
There were other disagreements between Scott and Smith. "Smith wanted the volume to offer an up-to-the minute statement on the contributors' work, while Scott wanted it to offer a more historical statement on the development of the contributors' poetry, in hopes of calling forth other, unknown modernist poets-in-the-making." 
In line with the anthology he envisioned, Smith penned a Preface in 1934 that was a manifesto of modernism and a rejection of all that had gone before. In Canadian poetry, he mocked, "The most popular experience is to be pained, hurt, stabbed or seared by beauty—preferably by the yellow flame of a crocus in the spring or the red flame of a maple leaf in the autumn." "The fundamental criticism that must be brought against Canadian poetry as a whole," he added, "is that it ignores the intelligence. And as a result it is dead." Scott had trouble reconciling that tone with the anthology he planned. "You will have to be careful not to make claims for a greater radicalism than this volume will show,” he warned Smith. 
For his part, Smith objected to the inclusion of the Toronto poets, describing Finch's imagery as "trite and undistinguished" and some of his lines as "distressingly Emily Dickensian," and calling Pratt "the weakest member of the group—judging of course by his inclusions only." However, Scott held firm on keeping both Pratt and Finch.
The final selection was: twelve poems by Smith, eleven by Finch, ten by Kennedy, ten by Scott, eight by Pratt, and two longer poems ("Out of the Pulver and the Polished Lens" and "Soirée of Velvel Kleinburger" ) by Klein. 
1936 edition.
Scott may have insisted on keeping Pratt to increase the chances of publication. Of the Montreal poets, only Kennedy had previously published a single volume of verse; in contrast, Pratt had been releasing books of poetry for over a decade. "Macmillan Canada had published Pratt’s poetry in the past, and Pratt approached Macmillan’s literary editor Hugh Eayrs on behalf of the "New Provinces" group" in 1934. 
One casualty of Pratt's involvement was Smith's Preface. Pratt, who was editor of the "Canadian Poetry Magazine", "objected to the Preface because its radical pronouncements could alienate half his magazine’s readers, and Scott wrote to Finch, 'We would not willingly compromise him'." Finch seconded Pratt's objections, prompting Smith to write to Scott: "Who the hell are Finch and Pratt to object to the preface? If I am willing to let my poems come out in the same book with Pratt's insipid stuff, he can take the preface." However, Smith's Preface was also "rejected by the publisher as being too impatient with traditional Canadian poetry", and it was dropped, with Scott writing a more "modest" Preface instead. 
When Macmillan also demanded "that the poets pay $200 toward the production of 650 to 675 copies of "New Provinces", Scott looked elsewhere, and submitted the manuscript to the Dent publishing company. At this point, Pratt threatened to leave the project if Macmillan did not publish it... In the end, Scott paid the bulk of the cost, $120, while Finch and Pratt each contributed $40. Smith, who could easily afford the fee, refused to contribute because of the argument over his Preface." 
"New Provinces" finally was printed in a limited run of 500 copies, of which only 250 were bound for sale, on May 9-11, 1936. All told, it "took 4 years of negotiation and pleading on the part of Scott before it was finally published by the Macmillan Co. of Canada." 
While the book sold poorly, it had an effect on those who read it. "The poems in "New Provinces" had an impact on Canadian verse far beyond any prefatorial pronouncements: in its implicit call for new findings and new attitudes in Canadian writing, it might be likened to the effect of the Wordsworth-Coleridge "Lyrical ballads" in 1798 on the Romantics... The effect of "New provinces" was that it established the ‘Montreal Group’ as the Canadian avant-garde of its time." 
1976 edition.
"New Provinces" was republished in 1976 by the University of Toronto Press, as part of its "Literature in Canada" series. Smith's unused Preface (which had been published in 1964 as the "Rejected Preface") was incorporated into the new work as an "important feature." As well, a new introduction was written by editor Michael Gnarowski. 
Appraisal.
The flyleaf of the 1976 edition called "New Provinces" "a monument in Canadian literature," and in his introduction, Gnarowski described it as "a singular event in a literary process which stemmed from the origins of Canadian modernism." Others have made similar claims about its significance: "In the "Literary History of Canada", Munro Beattie calls "New Provinces" 'a literary milestone,' and 'a literary signpost' (753,754). More recently, Brian Trehearne describes "New Provinces" as 'the landmark publication that signalled the demise of the old school of Canadian poetry' ("Aestheticism" 115)." In "The Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada", literary critic and anthologist W.H. New called "New Provinces" "an anthology that has between its covers the most famous enactment of modernist values in Canada." 
Later opinions were less praising. The 1997 "Oxford Companion to Canadian Literature" called the book "commercially unsuccessful but critically important," while in 2003 "Canadian Poetry" published an essay "designed to question a literary history which has canonized an unsuccessful volume of poetry published by a small group of Canadian modernists who excluded female poets." 
Despite poor sales and charges of sexism, though, "New Province"'s place in the modern Canadian canon looks assured. Besides its historical status as the first anthology of modern Canadian poetry, it is also notable for its contributors. Every contributor except for Kennedy (who never published another book) went on to win the Governor General's Award, Canada's top literary honor, for poetry.
As only 350 copies of the first edition were ever bound, it is extremely rare. A copy was being offered for sale in 2011 for $750.

Haitham al-Maleh

Haitham al-Maleh (, born 1931) is a Syrian democracy activist and former judge. He is a critic of the current Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad and has been imprisoned by the Syrian government as a political prisoner on several occasions since the 1960s. Maleh became an important opposition figure in the 2011 Syrian uprising.
Background.
Haitham al-Maleh earned a degree in law and a diploma in international law. He was first arrested in 1951 at the age of twenty when he called for an independent judiciary; he was imprisoned for three weeks. He became a judge in 1958. The first Baathist government dismissed him from the judicial bench because of his public criticism of the 1963 Emergency Law, which suspended constitutional rights and codified martial law. He returned to the practice of law after his dismissal.
The Syrian government ordered Maleh's arrest and detention numerous times because of his democracy activities. In 1978, Maleh was one of the authors of a document demanding constitutional reforms and the end of Emergency Law, which was soon endorsed by other professional organizations, culminating in a mass strike in March 1980. Maleh was jailed as a political prisoner between 1980 and 1986 because he publicly criticized human rights abuses committed by the government, the Emergency Law, and violations of the Syrian Constitution. He went on hunger strikes at least twice during his detention.
Maleh and other human rights activists founded the Human Rights Association in Syria in July 2001, and he was elected president of the organization, a position he held until 2006. He has been active in Amnesty International since 1989.
Maleh wrote several times to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad criticizing the human rights situation in his country. Writing as the president of the Syrian Human Rights Association, he demanded constitutional reforms and the lifting of the Emergency Law. In 2003, he spoke before the German Parliament on the issue of Syrian human rights, describing al-Assad's rule as "a fascist dictatorship". When he returned, the Syrian government banned him from leaving the country for the next seven years.
He has received many awards for his defense of human rights in Syria, including the Dutch Human Rights Prize awarded to him in 2006. The Syrian Government refused to allow him to leave the country to receive the award in the Netherlands. After weeks of uncertainty he learned of the final refusal to grant him an exit visa only the day before the ceremony. In 2004 Maleh received the French National Consultative Commission of Human Rights "Human Rights Honor Award" for his research on torture in Syria, and the annual award for the dignity of the Geneva Human Rights Defenders in 2010, in addition to other awards and honors.
2009 arrest.
Maleh's most recent arrest was on 14 October 2009, a day after giving an interview on 'Panorama', a political analysis show on Barada TV, a London-based satellite channel associated with the Syrian opposition and allegedly funded by the U.S. government. He was referred to the Damascus military court and tried on charges of spreading false and misleading information that would "affect the morale of the nation", and sentenced to three years prison. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience, "detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression", and called for his immediate release.
He was released on 8 March 2011 after a presidential amnesty on the anniversary of the arrival of the Baath party ascension to power, which was extended only to prisoners over 70 years old. As of July 2011 there are estimated to be 10,000 political prisoners in Syrian detention.
Maleh requested Syrian authorities to cease political detention permanently, release all political prisoners, and affirm the right of every Syrian citizen to express his opinion. He noted that political prisoners are those who voice their opinions, and are not advocates of violence.
In an interview with "The Daily Telegraph" on 30 January 2012, Maleh stated that the situation in Syria had passed the point where peaceful resolution was possible, and predicted that "Assad and his family will be killed in Syria, their next steps will be very bloody ... The end for him will be that he is killed like Gaddafi."
In an interview which aired on Al-Jazeera TV on December 18, 2012 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Maleh argued that Russians and Iranians may be subject to attacks by Syrian insurgents, arguing that "any civilian collaborating with occupiers or combatants is considered to be a legitimate target...Therefore, the citizens of these two countries, and of any other country fighting against the Syrian people, are considered legitimate targets for the rebels in Syria."

Reception.
Michael G. Nastos of Allmusic called "Moody 4B" a "safe concession to mainstream jazz" and that Mood "has still got it". He called Moody's sax play "polished and graceful" and his sidemen "too good and literate to be denied high accolades".
All About Jazz published three reviews of the album by Warren Allen, Edward Blanco, and Dan Bilawsky. Allen called the album a "a healthy dose of good swing by the best in the business". He called the two original numbers "sweet and catchy enough to fit seamlessly into the program" and closes by saying the recording "simply sounds like good jazz should". Blanco closed his review with "At 85 years young, James Moody keeps churning out some of the best straight ahead jazz in the business." Lastly, Bilawsky called the set "a fine edition to the catalog of one of the most enduring and important saxophonists in jazz".
Andrea Canter called the album "a monster quartet outing" in Jazz Police, going on she wrote that "each musician shines although perhaps none more than the leader".

Shrinkage (fabric)

Shrinkage is the process in which a fabric becomes smaller than its original size, usually through the process of laundry. Novice users of modern laundry machines sometimes experience accidental shrinkage of garments, especially when applying heat. Others may intentionally shrink a garment to their size. Some may purchase a garment one or more sizes larger in anticipation of shrinkage.
Causes.
For wool garments, shrinkage is due to scales on the fibers which heat, water and agitation cause to stick together. Other fabrics are stretched by mechanical forces during production, and can shrink slightly when heated (though to a lesser degree than wool). Some clothes are "pre-shrunk" to avoid this problem.

James C. Spencer

James Clarence Spencer (May 11, 1914 – December 25, 2009) was a survivor of the Bataan Death March during World War II and a Democratic politician from Athens, the seat of Henderson County in east Texas.
Background.
Spencer was born in Athens, the fifth of six children and the last surviving offspring, of Charles Augustus Spencer, a veteran of the Spanish-American War, and the former Lillian Freeman. At the age of twenty-four, he entered the Texas House of Representatives, serving two nonconsecutive terms from 1939–1941 and 1947–1949. Spencer also served a term as the Henderson county judge, but his obituary does not clarify his dates of service in that position.
Bataan Death March.
Between his state legislative terms, Spencer was a United States Army medic, who attained the rank of sergeant. He was held as a prisoner of war for three years in the Philippine Islands, after having survived the notorious Bataan Death March. Spencer told the "Lubbock Avalanche-Journal" in a 2008 interview that his captivity occurred during "a time of scarcity. Three years of near starvation with only meager rations of rice."
The march involved the forced transfer to prison camps of 75,000 American and Filipino prisoners, including later Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who had been captured by the Japanese in April 1942 at the Bataan Peninsula. The emaciated prisoners were compelled to march sixty miles in tropical heat without food and medication. Only 54,000 survived the nearly week-long march, characterized by extreme physical abuse inflicted on the men by their captors. Spencer said that he survived the march because of his "belief in Christ and determination." He indicated that he would again undergo such brutality to "help my country."
For his meritorious service, Spencer was awarded the Bronze Star. He was an active member of the Hub of the Plains chapter of American Ex-Prisoners of War.
Family life.
In January 1959, Spencer married the former Catherine Clay Cox (November 4, 1914—March 10, 2011), or "Katy," a native of Dallas, Texas. Her parents, William Elias Cox and the former Mary Ida Clay, were rural schoolteachers who reared their family in Henderson County. James and Katy first met when they were nine years old at a spelling bee in Athens, Texas, and then again in a chemistry class at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where both were students.
From a previous marriage to the former Oneita Hildebrand, Spencer had a son, Charles H. Spencer (born 1954), who is married to Anita Spencer, of Houston, Texas. James and Oneita Spencer lived in Texarkana, but the obituary does not indicate whether their residence was in Texas or Arkansas or how long they lived there. In 1936, Spencer received a degree in textile engineering from Texas Tech, presumably motivated by cotton which was then prevalent in east Texas. Nine years later upon his discharge from the military in 1945, Spencer served on the police force of the U.S. House of Representatives while he attended law school at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. His obituary does not indicate if he received a law degree. With his second marriage, he moved to Lubbock to take a position with the U.S. Postal Service, which he held until his retirement in the middle 1980s. He was a member of the Masonic lodge. 
From her previous marriage, Katy Spencer had a daughter, Ann (a 1962 graduate of Texas Tech). Katy Spencer graduated from Texas Tech in 1934 at the age of nineteen with a degree in chemistry. She had a long career as a medical technologist, much of it at the Methodist Hospital in Lubbock, but also earlier at the Ragland Clinic in Gilmer in Upshur County, Texas.
James and Katy Spencer were married just a few days short of fifty-one years. He died on Christmas Day 2009 in Lubbock, and she followed him in death some fifteen months later. They were members of the United Methodist church and are interred at Resthaven Cemetery in Lubbock.

NCAA Football 12

NCAA Football 12 is a college football video game created by EA Sports and developed by EA Tiburon. It is the successor to NCAA Football 11 in the NCAA Football series. It was released on July 12, 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Gameplay.
A new momentum-based tackling system has been introduced, including double-hit tackles and an overall increase in the number of tackle animations. A coach mode has also been added, where players can call plays, and make pre-play adjustments as well as watch them unfold, through a broadcast-style camera. Field grass is now rendered in 3-D for instant replays. In addition, various aspects of the game have added sponsorship picked up from SPARQ, Allstate, Coca-Cola Zero, Nissan, and Lowe's.
For Dynasty Mode, changes include a new coaching carousel where players can start as offensive or defensive coordinators and change jobs or get promoted after each season; at the same time, AI coaches will also switch positions or get fired. Crowds will be louder or quieter based on the player's team's success, and how big the stadium is. The ability to create custom conferences has been added; previous versions only allowed one-to-one swaps of teams between conferences; conference membership can also be changed from year to year. Bowl tie-ins can be changed, although there is still no end-of-season playoff option due to licensing with the BCS.
Road to Glory, a game mode in which a player takes control of a prospective collegiate athlete and must practice, study, and play at the level needed to win the Heisman Trophy, has been expanded to include an entire high school senior season (past versions of the game only included high school playoffs) and a points and rewards system to increase ratings.You can use teambuilder teams as your high school opponents. Support has been added for two-way players. Once in college, student-athletes can only advance on their team's depth chart (or call their own plays or audibles if a quarterback) when they have earned enough "trust points" from their coach.
However, major drawbacks of Road to Glory includes:
The demo, released on June 28 on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, features two matchups representing four conferences. One has the reigning Pac-10 champion Oregon Ducks visiting the Texas Longhorns of the Big 12. The second has the ACC's Atlantic Champion Florida State Seminoles hosting the Alabama Crimson Tide of the Southeastern Conference. Additionally, players can share the demo through Xbox Live or the Playstation Network to unlock the alternate Pro Combat uniforms of five squads for use in the full game.
Cover.
On April 19, 2011, it was announced that former Alabama running back and 2009 Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram, Jr. would be the cover athlete for the game. Ingram won a fan vote organized by EA Sports to determine who the cover athlete would be in a campaign using the slogan "U Want Me". Ingram beat out Auburn's Nick Fairley, Oklahoma's DeMarco Murray, and Washington's Jake Locker. Votes were taken through the game's Facebook page. Alternate covers (Nick Fairley, DeMarco Murray, Jake Locker) were made available for download on the NCAA Football 12 website.
Commentary.
The announcers remain the same from NCAA Football 11 with Kirk Herbstreit and Brad Nessler in the announcer booth along with Erin Andrews on the sideline. For the first time, Lee Corso will not be involved in the game as only Herbstreit predicts the winner of the matchup. However not all Corso Commentary was deleted in the PS3 version
Reception.
The game was rated 8.5/10 and called "great" by IGN. Another reviewer called the game "practically perfect". Reception from players who purchased the game was not quite so favorable, with some gamers criticizing the lack of innovation from previous installments, as well as linebackers who jump unrealistically high.

Jhamar

The Jhamar are a Hindu caste found in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. They are also known as Jhaunwar.
Origin.
The Jhamar are an occupational Hindu caste traditionally associated with basket makers. According to some traditions, the word Jhamar is a corruption of the Hindi word "jhaua", which means a basket. The Jhamar themselves claim to be Lodhas, who took up the occupation of basket making. Over time this change of occupation led to the formation of a distinct community. The Jhamar are involved in the making of baskets from the twigs of the Arhar plant. They are a small community, found mainly in the districts of Barabanki, Lucknow and Unnao. The Jhamar speak Awadhi among themselves and Hindi with outsiders.
Present Circumstances.
The Jhamar are strictly endogamous and practice clan exogamy. They are a landless community, with basket making still their principle occupation. A significant number of Jhamar are now daily wage labourers, involved in occupations such as rickshaw pulling. Each Jhamar settlement also contains a biradari panchayat, an informal caste association, which acts as an instrument of social control.

Emanuel Schlechter

Emanuel Schlechter (pseudonyms Eman, Olgierd Lech) (Emanuel Szlechter) (26 March 1906 – 1943) was born and died in Lwów. He was a Polish-Jewish artist, lyricist, screenwriter, librettist, writer, satirist, translator, composer and director.
His father was an owner of restaurant in Lwów. The family name of his mother was Brecher. When Szlechter was 14 years old, he joined to "Małopolskie Oddziały Armii Ochotniczej" (Lesser Poland's Volunteer Army) and during summer 1920 he participated in defense of Lwów.
After passing his matura exam around 1923 he studied law at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lwów and worked briefly in a law firm. His earliest lyrics were written for Leon Borunski's songs, staged at the "Morskie Oko" theater's "Parada gwiazd" show in 1930, performed and recorded by Syrena Rekord star Kazimierz Krukowski.
Career.
In 1931, Schlechter created the Lwów Academic Theatre "Złoty pieprzyk (Golden mole)". One of his first revues, "Co słychać w wielkim świecie (What's going on in the big world)" included his first hit song, "Żołnierska brać". He performed as a singer in the Lwów cafes of "Musa" and "Roma", accompanied by the pianist Julius Gabla. He also wrote columns for newspapers.
Around 1932, he moved permanently to Warsaw. In 1933, he wrote the screenplay and songs for the first Polish film operetta "Każdemu wolno kochać" (Everyone is allowed to love), directed by Mieczyslaw Krawicz. He worked at the "Rex" theater writing songs, revues, sketches, scenarios, satirical songs and monologues. Between 1933 and 1935 he recorded as a singer and guitarist, as himself or using a nickname of Olgierd Lech. He made a series of "Jewish" records including like "Awremałe" (Avremele), "Śpiewak sobotni", "Rabi Eli-Melech" (Rabbi Elimelech), "Alef Bet" (Oyfn Pripetchok), and "Żydowskie wesele" (Yidishe khasene). One of the most popular songs by Schlechter was "Srulek". He worked with the "Columbia" and "Odeon" orchestras. In 1934 he wrote for "La Bohème" theater, collaborating with Konrad Tom.
He wrote lyrics of many songs featured in Polish pre-war films including "Parada rezerwistów", "Kobiety na sprzedaż", "Trójka hultajska", "Kocha, lubi, szanuje", "Czy Lucyna to dziewczyna?", "Co mój mąż robi w nocy", "Jaśnie pan szofer", "Dodek na froncie", "Jego wielka miłość", "Skłamałam", "Książątko", "Wyrok życia", "Robert i Bertranda", and "Czarna perła". He wrote screenplays of "Antek policmajster" (with Konrad Tom and Michał Waszyński), "Będzie lepiej" (with Ludwik Starski and Michał Waszyński), "Jadzia" (with Karol Jarossy and Mieczysław Krawicz), "Ja tu rządzę" (with Ludwik Starski and Mieczysław Krawicz), "Królowa przedmieścia" (with Jerzy Nel and Eugeniusz Bodo), "Piętro wyżej" (with Ludwik Starski, Eugeniusz Bodo, and Leon Trystan), "Szczęśliwa trzynastka" (with Ludwik Starski, Aleksander Pękalski, and Marian Czauski), and "Włóczęgi" (with Konrad Tom and Michał Waszyński).
Starting in 1935 he worked with the "Cyrulik Warszawski" and "Małe Qui pro Quo" theaters.
Some of his hits included:
After the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, Schlechter was in Soviet-occupied Lwów, working at the Lwów Teatr Miniatura as an actor, writer and director. He was known for his anti-Nazi satires. After German entered Lwów in 1941, Schlechter was sent to the Lvov ghetto, then to the Janowska concentration camp where he was part of its artistic life, participating in literary evenings. He most likely died in 1942 with his wife and young son, although it is possible that he managed to survive until 1943.

Henry George Purchase

Henry George Purchase (1873 – 14 September 1945) was an English barrister and Liberal politician.
Family and education.
Henry George Purchase was the son of George and Victoria Purchase of Weymouth in Dorset He was educated at King's College, London where he received the law degree, LL.B. In 1902, he married Kathleen Roberts the daughter of a Justice of the Peace from Hollybrook in County Cork. His wife died in 1910 and they do not appear to have had any children.
Career.
Following his university degree, Purchase took further law examinations and in 1913 he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple. He then joined the Northern Circuit, localised at Liverpool and later acquired the degree of Doctor of Law from London University.
During the Great War Purchase performed various public tasks. In 1915, he was sent on a special mission to France for the purpose of organising a British and American hospital at Neuilly. In 1917 he took a post in the enforcement branch of the Ministry of Food in London and was shortly afterwards made an assistant director of the Ministry.
Politics.
1918.
Sir Stephen Collins, the Liberal MP for Kennington in Lambeth since 1906 decided not to contest the seat at the 1918 general election, perhaps because at the age of 71 he felt it was time to stand down. This left a vacancy and Purchase was selected to fight the seat for the Liberals. Purchase stood as a supporter of the Coalition government of David Lloyd George. It is not known of he was in receipt of the Coalition coupon but he was to be opposed by a Unionist, Colonel Francis Alfred Lucas, the former MP for Lowestoft who had fought the seat in the general elections of January and December 1910. However Lucas died before polling day, invalidating the poll and the election in Kennington had to be run as a separate event about a fortnight after all other polling on 20 December 1918. Purchase faced two opponents, for the Unionists, Mrs Alice Lucas, the widow of Col. Lucas was chosen thus giving the Conservative Party its first woman candidate in a Parliamentary election. 
Mr William Glennie fought the seat for the Labour Party. Purchase may not have received the ‘coupon’ but he did get a telegram of support from Lloyd George. Despite the novelty of Mrs Lucas’ candidacy, the election seems to have been a lacklustre affair. "The Times" newspaper reported on polling day that ‘...very little interest is being taken in the contest and a visitor to the constituency would have difficulty in knowing that an election is in progress.’ Purchase held the seat for the Liberals and the Coalition with a majority of 1,132 votes and 42% of the poll, Mrs Lucas polled 32% and Glennie came third with 25%. Although this was a good majority compared with the 55 votes by which Sir Stephen Collins had defeated Colonel Lucas in December 1910, it was perhaps closer than some commentators anticipated, given the landslide for the Coalition which had taken place overall. One historian has written of Mrs Lucas’ result that she was ‘probably the first woman to discover that there is nothing like bereavement, injury or childbirth to commend a candidate to the British electorate.’
Government office.
Following his attachment as Assistant Director to the Ministry of Food in 1918, in its Enforcement Branch, Purchase was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chairman of the National Insurance Joint Committee in 1919. He also served as Hon. Secretary to Coastwise Traffic Parliamentary Committee and was a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee of the Lords and Commons.
1922-1935.
Purchase defended his seat at the 1922 general election as a Lloyd George National Liberal against Labour and Conservative opponents. In a reversal of fortune from 1918, Purchase found himself at the bottom of the poll with just 16.6% of the votes cast. The seat was won for the Tories by Francis Capel Harrison with a majority of 2,411 votes.
Purchase made regular attempts to get back into the House of Commons. He stood as Liberal candidate in Kidderminster in 1923 and in the same seat in 1924. He then contested Leicester South in 1929, Gainsborough in 1931 and finally Blackpool in 1935 - all without success.
Other appointments.
In 1899, Purchase had been appointed as one of the Hon Secretaries to the Tercentenary Celebration of the birth of Oliver Cromwell. As well as commemorating the anniversary of Cromwell’s birth at an event in the City Temple on 25 April 1899, and arranging for the erection of a statue of Cromwell in the grounds of the Houses of Parliament, the Tercentenary Committee also set up a fund for various charitable projects including improvements to Huntingdon Grammar School where Cromwell was educated. But donations were also made to other good causes. In November 1899, the former Liberal prime minister, Lord Rosebery was the leading speaker at a commemorative meeting which raised money for the Prince of Wales’s Hospital Fund.
The following year Purchase became an Assistant Secretary of the New Reform Club, a club founded in 1900 as a social rallying point for what was then called ‘advanced Liberal organisations’ (that is those supporting radical policies such as those embodied in the Newcastle Programme), although it harked back to more traditional Liberal approaches in its desire to bring about ‘peace, retrenchment and reform’ in the footsteps of the plans for the original Reform Club. Robert Reid MP was the Club’s first president. Purchase operated as Secretary from the Club’s premises in St Ermine’s Mansions in Westminster. 
Purchase also furthered his political ambitions by becoming the Secretary to the Committee of London Liberal MPs in which capacity he served from 1918–1922 and in 1930 he was a member of the Bar delegation to Canada and the United States.
Publications.
In 1931, Purchase produced a legal text book, "The Law relating to Documents of Title to Goods", published by Sweet & Maxwell Ltd.

Hawk Eyes

Hawk Eyes are a rock band from Leeds, England. They formed in late 2004 and released their official debut "Modern Bodies" on 1 November 2010 through Brew Records.
History.
Early years (2004–2007)
The band played a part in the Leeds underground DIY metal and hardcore scene, amongst the local squats and dives. Some small CD splits and self-released CD-r's appeared during this time, all recorded with Ross Halden in his home basement studio "Ghost Town Studios". Following years of house shows, small releases and self-organised tours, "Brew Records" picked up on the band and included them on their first release in 2007, a compilation entitled "Volume 1" featuring other local bands part of the same DIY scene. This was to become a much stronger relationship as time passed. The band next decided to make an album of all the material they had to date and recorded it in sessions between Chris Fielding at Foel Studio in Wales and Jason Sanderson in Barnsley. Nottingham based label "Sound Devastation" released the self-titled debut on a limited run in 2008 and soon after Reid joined the band to complete the line-up and continue touring. The album and compilation both received great praise from the press.
2008
In mid-2008 the band decided to film their first music video for the track 'NASA Vs ESA' (taken from the self-titled debut) and shortly after its release local Leeds label "Brew Records", offered to add Hawk Eyes to their growing roster (I Concur, Kong, These Monsters, Castrovalva). They saw the year out with further touring and writing.
2009
In March they returned to Jason Sanderson's studio to record their first material with latest member Reid. An EP entitled "A. Or Not?" (named after a close friend/promoter), and in support of the EP's release, they produced their second video for the track "I Hate This, Do You Like It?" in collaboration with the NME / SPIN Magazine photographer Danny North. The EP was released in the late summer of 2009 following Hawk Eyes' first festival appearance on the Introducing stage at the Leeds and Reading festivals and a UK tour with label mates "Kong". At this point another Leeds independent label Dance To The Radio, asked the band to contribute a track towards their '4 X 12' series'. The track used was called "Scorpieau" - recorded by old friend Ross Halden at his newly located penthouse "Ghost Town Studios" mark II. Both the EP and the 12" split received positive national recognition. They closed the year off with their largest tour to date supporting US outfit The Fall of Troy across the UK. 
2010
Hawk Eyes started the year touring with The Computers and Outcry Collective, and were invited by Mike Davies to record at BBC's Maida Vale Studio in London for the Radio 1 punk rock show during the tour.
The band played over 10 festivals across the country including Leeds & Reading, Hevy Festival and Sonisphere. Brew then released "Modern Bodies", a selection of songs taken from previous limited releases, collected together on one new album. Remixed By Kevin Vanbergen, remastered and featuring brand new artwork by Reid and North. The album received critical acclaim worldwide. A UK tour supporting We Are The Ocean and a UK/European tour supporting Alexisonfire followed with positive reviews.
2011
Between January and October the band recorded the follow up releases, "Mindhammers" and "Ideas". During November Hawk Eyes toured the UK with Turbowolf and The JCQ
In December Hawk Eyes toured as main support for Ginger Wildheart.
On 12 December Hawk Eyes released "Mindhammers" a 5 track EP on Download on limited 10" Vinyl.
2012
Hawk Eyes released "Ideas" on 21 March 2012 through Vinyl Junkie in Japan and 26 March 2012 on Fierce Panda in the UK. It was revealed that their drummer Matt Reid had left the band and that Steve Wilson, the former drummer of Japanese Voyeurs and Dinosaur Pile-Up, had joined the band. During 2012 Hawk Eyes toured extensively throughout the UK, Europe and Japan. "Ideas" received high praise from the rock press including 5Ks in Kerrang, being nominated for Best Newcomer at 2012's Kerrang awards.
2013
Whilst still touring Hawk Eyes have been putting the finishing touches to a new EP 'That's What This Is' available to Pre-Order via pledgemusic. The band are also about to begin recording a new album.

Boxman Studios

In 2008, Boxman Studios began fabricating metal shipping containers for the hospitality industry. Based out of Charlotte, NC, their concept was to create environmentally friendly mobile hospitality venues by repurposing decommissioned containers and turning them into upscale outdoor spaces for events and trade shows that they deliver and deploy. 
The "pop up parties" have been used by Budweiser events at NASCAR races, and by vitaminwater at NFL tailgate parties. The units can be combined into several stories, or expanded with panels between them to allow for dance floors. The solar power provides electricity for the refrigerators, bars, music decks, even television sets. Setting up a unit of 46 m2 which is complete with a variety of purposes takes twenty minutes.. In 2010 Boxman Studios was nominated as one of the 25 finalists for the Opportunity Green Innovative Green Startup Award.
Mobile food vending services.
Because the boxman studios lunchbox is not on wheels, it was against the law to operate as a mobile food vendor unit in Charlotte. Boxman studios were given a public hearing by Charlotte City Council to change the ordinance regulating mobile food vendors in 2010. They petitioned for the adoption of a text amendment to the zoning ordinance to expand the types of structures acceptable for use as mobile food vending services.

Plácido Benavides

Plácido Benavides (1810–1837) was an early Mexican-born settler in De Leon's Colony, Victoria County, Texas. Benavides earned himself the sobriquet of the Paul Revere of Texas for his 1836 journey from San Patricio to Goliad to Victoria, warning residents of the approaching Mexican army. He was twice elected alcalde of Victoria, Texas. He married into the powerful De León family, and with his wife Agustina became the father of three daughters. Benavides fought against the dictatorship of Antonio López de Santa Anna, but did not feel Texas should be separated from Mexico.
He led a unit of Tejano fighters at the Battle of Goliad and then he proceeded with his company to San Antonio, where they fought against Martín Perfecto de Cos in the Siege of Bexar. On February 11, 1836, Benavides sent a warning to James Bowie inside the Alamo that Santa Anna was approaching. Benavides escaped the Battle of Agua Dulce and was able to warn James Fannin headquartered in Goliad of the enemy army's approach, as he had warned all towns between Agua Dulce and Goliad. When the Texas Declaration of Independence was signed on March 2, 1836, James Fannin discharged Benavides from the army and sent him home. On his route back to Victoria, Benavides spread the alarm about the march of the Mexican army. In 1836, Benavides and his family were among the Mexicans evacuated out of Victoria by Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk. His family exiled to Louisiana, where he died of an unknown cause the next year. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6563 placed in 1936 at the SW Corner of S. Main and Juan Linn in Victoria, marks the site of the Benavides Round Top house.
Early life.
Plácido Benavides was born in 1810, in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Details of his youth are unknown, except that he was taken under the wing of his godfather Captain Henrique Villareal. In 1828, Benavides moved to Victoria, Texas with his brothers Ysidro, Nicolás and Eugenio. He became secretary to Fernando De León, the eldest son of the influential De León family in Victoria County. There, Benavides was put in the position of overseeing land titles and general business transactions. He married into the De Leon family in 1831. The Mexican government authorized Benavides to continue recruiting colonists to De Leon's Colony after the 1833 death of empresario Martín De León.
In 1832 and 1834, Benavides was elected second alcalde of Victoria. Martín De León had held the position as the first alcalde, and Silvestre De León served as the third alcalde. Benavides built a house fortress with first-floor gun slits and reinforced door, that became known alternately as "Plácido's Round House" and the "Round Top House". Benavides and his brother-in-law Silvestre De León, led several attacks against the Tonkawa and Karankawa Indian tribes. After the death of Benavides, many lives were saved in 1840 by hiding in the round house during a raid by 600 Comanches. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 6563 placed in 1936 at the SW Corner of S. Main and Juan Linn in Victoria, marks the site of the Benavides Round Top house.
At war with Santa Anna.
When Antonio López de Santa Anna became President of Mexico on April 1, 1833, he revoked the 1824 Constitution of Mexico and replaced its Federalist form of government with a Centralist regime to further his military dictatorship. He appointed his brother-in-law Martín Perfecto de Cos as commandant-general northeast of Saltillo. Some in the De Leon extended family felt loyal to the Federalist government of the constitution.
José María Jesús Carbajal.
On April 28, 1835, federal legislation in Mexico invalidated the Four Hundred League Law that had been passed by the Coahuila y Texas legislature. Benavides' brother-in-law José María Jesús Carbajal was an elected representative from Bexar to that legislature. General Martín Perfecto de Cos sent troops to shut down the legislature, and ordered the arrest of all who voted for the Four Hundred League Law. Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, as principal commandant of Coahuila y Texas, ordered Cabajal arrested, but soldiers searching for him in Victoria were unsuccessful in their attempts at doing so. Alcalde Benavides had refused to surrender Carbajal, and ordered his local militia to block the soldiers from entry into Victoria.
La Bahia.
After Gonzales, Texas repelled the Mexican attempted seizure of their cannon on October 2, 1835, Benavides teamed up with John Joseph Linn
to capture General Cos. In Victoria, they joined with George M. Collinsworth who was training men for the same purpose. During the Battle of Goliad, Benavides was put in charge of thirty Tejano volunteers, who were part of the October 1835 storming of Presidio La Bahía. Goliad was captured by Collinsworth on October 10, 1835.
James Bowie.
Following the capture of Goliad, Benavides and his men were ordered to join Stephen F. Austin in the two-month Siege of Béxar campaign to drive out General Cos. As part of the campaign, Benavides and his men joined with the James Bowie group in October 1835. In the process of searching for enemy horses, Benavides suggested to Bowie that they torture a simple Mexican herder into admitting he was hiding horses for the Mexican soldiers. The particular torture method used by Benavides and Bowie was to hang the herder by the neck until he almost choked to death, then let him down and threaten him with guns. After executing this method of torture three successive times on the man, the herder confessed and surrendered his herd to Bowie.
Matamoros jail break.
José María Jesús Carbajal, his brother-in-law Fernando De León, and Peter Kerr, responded to an arms plea from Stephen F. Austin and began to run horses and mules to New Orleans in a trade for munitions. The trio were captured by Mexicans and taken prisoner. Kerr was set free, and Fernando De León bribed his way out. Carbajal was transferred to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, with an intended transfer for imprisonment at San Juan de Ulloa. In February 1836, Plácido Benavides was serving at San Patricio under Major Robert C. Morris. When word arrived of Carbajal's imprisonment, Benavides took a small group of men to break Carbajal out of incarceration. He bribed the guards at Matamoros. Although Mexicans gave pursuit, the escape back to Victoria was a success.
Goliad.
The alcalde of Matamoros had leaked to Benavides that Antonio López de Santa Anna planned to draw the Texas forces below the Rio Grande. Benavides reported the information to Major Morris, who in turn passed it along to James Fannin. Upon receipt of the information, Fannin decided against his planned invasion of Matamoros and instead moved his men to Goliad.
Alamo.
Inside the Alamo Mission in San Antonio, at 1 a.m. on February 11, 1836, messenger Blas María Herrera delivered to James Bowie a letter from Benavides, that stated Santa Anna was moving towards San Antonio with a large deployment of troops.
Texas Paul Revere.
On February 27, 1836, while Benavides and James Grant were out with a detachment hunting wild mustangs, General José de Urrea captured San Patricio. On March 2, 1836, Benavides and Grant stumbled into a trap set by Urrera at Agua Dulce Creek, south of San Patricio. Benavides tried to rejoin the men but was ordered by Grant to save himself and warn Fannin of Urrea's approach. Upon reaching Fannin with the warning, and learning that the Texas Declaration of Independence had just been signed at Washington-on-the-Brazos, Benavides informed Fannin that he did not wish to help Texas to be torn from Mexico. Fannin discharged Benavides from the army and sent him home to Victoria. From San Patricio to his final destination of Victoria, Benavides warned every person and town along the way of Urrea's approach. Benavides became known as the Paul Revere of Texas.
Isaac D. Hamilton.
On March 27, 1836, following the Battle of Coleto, Mexican soldiers under General José de Urrea gunned down 342 unarmed Texans. Isaac D. Hamilton, who had served with Benavides at Goliad, escaped and found refuge on a ranch owned by Benavides. Upon finding the wounded Hamilton, Benavides attempted to take Hamilton to safety. Encountering a Mexican unit, Benavides saved himself by claiming Hamilton was his prisoner. Hamilton was tortured and taken to Victoria to face a firing squad. He was rescued by "The Angel of Goliad", Francisca Alvarez. With the help of Alvarez, Hamilton escaped back to his hometown of Courtland, Alabama. Hamilton returned to Texas, and in 1858 the Texas legislature awarded him a bounty certificate for league of land, as part of the state's bounty grants for participants in the battle of the Alamo, the siege of Bexar, the Goliad campaigns. Hamilton died in 1859 before he was able to take possession of the land.
Exile to Louisiana.
During the Texas War of Independence many Mexicans were opposed to Santa Anna's regime, but felt loyal to Mexico and its 1824 constitution. Brigadier General Thomas Jefferson Rusk ordered the evacuation of Mexican families ""...who were likely to afford information to the enemy."" The Carbajal, Benavides and De Leon families evacuated to New Orleans, leaving behind their wealth and everything they owned.
Personal life and death.
In 1831 Benavides married Agustina De León, daughter of empresario Martín De León and his wife Patricia de la Garza De León. The couple had three daughters, Pilar, Librada and Matiana.
Benavides died in Opelousas, Louisiana in 1837, cause unknown.

San Francisco Italian Athletic Club

The San Francisco Italian Athletic Club is a men's social and athletic club located at 1630 Stockton Street on Washington Square, North Beach in San Francisco, California.
History.
The current club was the result of the merger of several smaller Italian sports clubs in San Francisco. The first club formed in 1917 and was called "Circolo Recreativo Italiano Virtus". In 1919 a second club emerged called "Unione Sportiva Italiana". Shortly thereafter "Sporting Club Italia" began in 1920. The following year SC Italia joined with Virtus becoming "Italia Virtus Club". In 1926 they merged with Unione to become the largest Italian sports club in the country as "Unione Sportiva Italiana Virtus". By 1936 the current building of the club had been completed at which point they became known as "Italian Athletic Club". Negative sentiment during the WWII period led to the club dropping 'Italian' from their name and continued as simply "San Francisco Athletic Club" until 1979 when 'Italian' was once again part of their name.
Athletics.
The club has participated in numerous sporting activities including baseball, basketball cycling, fencing, gymnastics, running, and soccer. Their "Statuto Race" is among the oldest annual foot races in the country having started back in 1919 to commemorate Italy's first constitution as a cohesive nation. One of the club's highest achievements was accomplished by their soccer team when they won the 1976 National Challenge Cup Steve Negoesco, of USF fame, was the coach of the champion soccer team. Other notable people from the SFIAC club are Ray Piva (runner), Steve Landi (power lifter), Gino Cimoli (baseball), and Steve Mariucci (football).

"The Blind Man in the Bleachers" is a single by American singer David Geddes. His version, titled "The Last Game of the Season (A Blind Man in the Bleachers)", reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1975.
It was later covered by country music artist Kenny Starr. Released in 1975, the song is from his album "The Blind Man in the Bleachers". The song peaked at number 2 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles chart. It also reached number 1 on the "RPM" Country Tracks chart in Canada.
Song story.
The song is a salute to high school football and focuses on a junior varsity football player (who rarely, if ever sees action in varsity games) and his father, a blind man who sits next to the press box – where the speaker is located. The father longs to hear his son's name be announced but is resigned to the boy being a star in his dreams.
The meat of the story comes later in the song, with the scene shifting to the final night of the regular season and the regular fans puzzled at why the boy's father didn't show up for the game. At halftime, with several players injured, the boy takes an emergency phone call and is late to the field. The coach, unaware of what's going on, begins to scold the boy but the boy insists that he's going in on the next play. He does, takes the pitch on the first play and immediately runs for a touchdown. The boy eventually helps rally his team from a deficit and get a come-from-behind win.
In the post-game huddle, the boy becomes emotional and – when asked to explain why he played so well – reveals that his father had died earlier in the evening (why he wasn't at the game) and – presumably having gone to Heaven – was now granted eyesight and got to watch his son play and be the player of the game.

Janne Teller

Janne Teller (born 8 April 1964) is a Danish writer of fiction. 
Literature.
Janne Teller's literature, consisting of mainly novels and essays, but also short stories – as well as various works for young adults – always focuses on larger existential perspectives of life and human civilization and often sparks controversial and heated debates. 
She has received many literary awards, and her work is translated over 13 languages (as of August 2011).
Janne Teller’s novels cover a wide variety of contemporary and philosophical issues. 
They include the highly praised modern Nordic saga Odin’s Island (1999), dealing with religious and political fanaticism; Europa (2004), about European identity and the binds of history in love and war; and Come (2008), about ethics in art and modern life. 
Her essays cover existential and ethical perspectives of modern life, and include ‘Between the Lines’ (Lettre International, 2012), "Europe, who do you want to be?" (Die Welt, 2012) and 'Little Brother is watching you' (Cicero, 2010).
She's furthermore thought to have revolutionized the young adult novel with her existential "Nothing" (Danish "Intet"), first published in Denmark in 2000, earned critical acclaim and caused widespread controversy in Scandinavia. It was initially banned, but has since risen as an international bestseller and is today considered a neo-classic by numerous critics worldwide. The novel's main character, the boy Pierre Anthon, proclaims to his classmates that life is meaningless, sitting in a plum tree.

Hampton High School, Melbourne

Hampton High School is a former secondary school located in the Hampton suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The school occupied the block bounded by Ludstone, Favril and Passchendaele Streets. Established in 1935, the school was closed in 1988. Alumni are known as Old Hamptonians.
History.
In 1934, the Education Department purchased land in Ludstone St Hampton from the War Homes Commission. The land had previously been a part of the Castlefield Estate, which later became Haileybury College. Following the purchase, a single story building with Georgian style portico entrance was built. The school campus also included a sporting oval on the western side of the property. While the sports field was utilised for various sporting activities, football and cricket were played on the Castlefield Reserve. In 1952, the administration built a two-storied Manual Arts Block to provide additional accommodations, which also provided facilities for teaching art, craft, woodwork, metalwork and domestic science.
In 1957, a fire destroyed the majority of the main building. A newly renovated building was opened in 1959, which was representative of the style of the original 1930s building. During this time, a new single-storied building was erected on the western side of the main building to support the growing number of matriculation students. This building became the prototype for many Victorian high schools that were built to support other schools throughout Victoria. In 1966, the main building was partly demolished to make way for new science laboratories, which were funded through a federal government grant.

Montauk Point land claim

The Montauk Point land claim was a series of three lawsuits brought by Chief Wyandank Pharaoh, nephew of the Stephen Talkhouse who died in the same year (1879) that the tribe lost the last remaining vestige of their territory in the New York state courts, claiming Montauk Point on behalf of the Montaukett Indians, against the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and its predecessors in title. 
The first suit, Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co., brought by Wyandank Pharaoh in the name of the tribe, was dismissed because the tribe had not been explicitly authorized by the state to sue in its own name.
As recommended by the Appellate Division's opinion, the second suit, Johnson v. Long Island R.R. Co., was brought in the name of Eugene M. Johnson, a citizen and tribal member. The New York Court of Appeals disavowed the previous dicta of the Appellate Division, and held that neither an individual Indian nor a tribe could sue in court without enabling legislation.
The tribe failed in its efforts to convince the federal government to pass legislation enabling the tribe to bring the claim in federal court. In 1906, the state passed a statute enabling the tribe to sue, and Wyandank Pharaoh brought a third suit, Pharaoh v. Benson, in the name of the tribe. Reaching the merits, the New York courts held that the tribe no longer existed and that the transactions were valid. Since the litigation, the Montauks have failed in their efforts to obtain compensation from the federal and state government, and much of the land in question has come to be held by public parks.
Background.
Circa 1875, the Montauk tribe began renting out Montauk Point for pasturage through the Proprietors' Company; the company took possession of the grazing allotments, and paid the tribe an annuity. Circa 1880, the shareholders of the company disagreed over whether the lands should continue to be leased, or whether they should be re-apportioned. In 1878, Robert M. Grinnell sued Edward M. Baker et al. for partition and division of the allotments. In "Grinnell v. Baker" (unreported), the court ordered the lands sold at public auction (subject to the Montauk claim), with the proceeds distributed equally among the non-Indian lessees, rather than the Montauk tribe. 
The auction took place at the home of Jehial Parsons. Arthur W. Benson bought the at auction for $151,000 in 1879. In turn, Benson sold of the land to the Long Island Rail Road for $600,000. 
Benson hired Nathaniel Dominey to negotiate the removal of the Montauks still living on the reservation. At a later, Senate Sub-Committee hearing, Dominey testified that eight Indians remained on the reservation at the time, including: future Chief Wyandank Pharaoh (10 years old at the time), his mother, and two of her brothers. Later, Dominey experienced a change of heart and cooperated with the Montauks in their claim, and turning over his letters from Benson. Dominey testified that he compensated Wyandank Pharaoh's mother with a $100 semi-annual annuity and two houses, to be inherited by Pharaoh, $80 each to her two brothers, and $10 to Wyandank.
Arthur Benson had viewed Montauk as "his private playground"; after his death, his son approached Austin Corbin, President and controlling shareholder of the Long Island Rail Road, and Charles Pratt, of Standard Oil, about the possibility of voiding his fathers will and opening Montauk to development. Montauk Point was purchased by Corbin and Pratt in 1895.
On October 30, 1895, Chief Wyandank Pharaoh returned from a research trip to Brooklyn and Washington, D.C. to gather evidence to pursue a claim. Pharaoh declared his intentions to undertake a hunting trip on the disputed land and initiate a lawsuit if he was interfered with.
The "New York Times" blamed Chief Pharaoh for the dispute:
If King Wyandank Pharaoh of the Montauk Tribe of Indians had not given for $10 the living members of the Montauk tribe might now be wealthy, instead of being poor and fighting for their rights with a desperate hope of regaining at least part of what they claim to be their lawful heritage.
"Montauk Tribe of Indians v. Long Island R.R. Co." (App. Div. 1898).
Chief Talkhouse, on behalf of the tribe, filed suit, stating a cause of action for ejectment on February 5, 1897. For proof of tribal status, the tribe cited a partition action decided by Judge Dykman and the 1890 United States Census. The complaint valued the land at approximately $300,000.
On June 5, 1897, Judge Wilmot Moses Smith of the New York Supreme Court set a hearing date for June 19 in Patchogue to hear the oral arguments for the defendants' demurrer. The matter was transferred to Judge Samuel T. Maddox in Brooklyn. Judge Maddox granted the demurrer, dismissing the action but allowing the tribe to re-plead if they paid costs.
The Montauk's, represented by ex-judge George M. Curtis, filed a notice of appeal on December 22, 1897. Before the Appellate Division, the Montauk's case was argued by Leman B. Treadwell, with Francis M. Morrison (both Boston lawyers) also on the brief. Alfred A. Gardner argued on behalf of the LIRR, with William J. Kelly on the brief. The Appellate Division panel consisted of Judges Goodrich, Edgar M. Cullen, Willard Bartlett, Hatch, and Woodward.
The Appellate Division of the Second Department unanimously affirmed the judgment of the Suffolk Special Term on April 19, 1898. Citing "Strong v. Waterman" and "Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy", Judge Cullen noted that "no provision had been made by law for bringing ejectment to recover possession of " and "as a body or tribe, the Indians have no corporate name by which they can institute such a suit." Judge Cullen suggested that the tribe either petition the legislature for enabling legislation to allow them to sue as a tribe, or have individual members bring the suit.
"Johnson v. Long Island R.R. Co." (N.Y. 1900).
Eugene M. Johnson, a U.S. citizen of Montauk descent, and a member of the tribe since birth, brought a similar suit in his own name, on behalf of himself and other similarly interested. The Special Term sustained a demurrer. 
The divided panel of the Appellate Division of the Second Department reversed on July 1, 1899. In a per curiam opinion, joined by all but Judge Willard Bartlett, the Appellate Division held:
While the right to maintain this action in its present form is not free from doubt, still, as it is brought in accordance with the view expressed by us on the prior appeal, we think we should adhere to our former decision, and allow the question to be finally determined by the court of appeals. 
The Appellate Division certified three questions to the Court of Appeals:
1. Has the plaintiff in this action legal capacity to sue?<br>2. Is there a defect of the parties plaintiff in this action, in that the members of the alleged Montauk Tribe of Indians are not made parties plaintiff?<br>3. Does the complaint herein state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action?
Before the Court of Appeals, Treadwell and Morrison again argued for the Montauks, while Gardner and Kelly again argued for the LIRR.
The New York Court of Appeals reversed the Appellate Division, and affirmed the Special Term, on April 17, 1900. The court answered all three certified questions in the negative, without costs to either party. Judge Edward T. Bartlett, joined by Judges Denis O'Brien, Albert Haight, and Celora E. Martin, held that Johnson had no capacity to bring a suit on the tribe's behalf. The Court held that Indians, as wards of the state, had no right to sue unless conferred by statute: 
A decision holding that this action could be maintained either by the tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who should come in and contribute, would be contrary to the policy and practice which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes. They are regarded as the wards of the state, and, generally speaking, possessed of only such rights to appear and litigate in courts of justice as are conferred upon them by statute.
Chief Judge Alton B. Parker concurred in the result, without separate opinion; Judges Irving G. Vann and Landon dissented, without opinion.
Senate Indian Affairs Sub-Committee hearing (1900).
Chief Pharaoh, along with representatives of the Shinnecock Tribe, Narragansett Tribe, and Mohegan Tribe, testified before a Sub-Committee of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on September 22, 1900 at the Fifth Avenue Hotel. The Sub-Committee consisted of Senators John M. Thurston (R-NE) and Orville H. Platt (R-CT). In addition to Pharaoh, the testifying Indians were: Rev. Eugene A. Johnson, Nathan J. Cuffee, and James Cuffee (of the Montauk Council), John Noka, Joshua Noka, and Donald Seeter (of the Narragansett Council), David Kellis (of the Shinnecock Council). Maria Crippen and Dr. William H. Johnson of the Montauk tribe were among the spectators.
Rev. Johnson testified that there were 300 living members of the Montauk tribe. Johnson also testified that the New York state legislature had denied the Montauks a hearing because they were not "persons." Johnson argued that the Montauks could not alienate property without the consent of both New York and the federal government. He valued the disputed property at $3,000,000.
The tribes requested special legislation to allow them to bring their land claims, for fraud, in the United States circuit court. The Montauks and Shinnecocks claimed of Montauk Point; the Narragansetts an eight-square-mile tract near Narragansett Bay; the Mohegans a reservation in and near Norwich, Connecticut. Tredwell and Morrison continued to represent the tribes before the hearing.
State enabling legislation (1906).
A bill granting the Montauks permission to sue was introduced in February 1903. The Montauk's lawyer, Charles O. Maas, was the key lobbyist for the bill.
On April 10, 1906, the New York legislature passed a statute enabling the Montauk tribe to bring suit, The act contained the following proviso: "the question as to the existence of the Montauk Tribe of Indians shall be a question of law and fact to be determined by the court." Judge Blackmar interpreted the act as "providing that the act should not be construed as conferring tribal rights on any individuals, but that the question of the existence of the Montauk Tribe should be determined by the court."
"Pharaoh v. Benson" (N.Y. 1918).
Pursuant to the enabling act, Chief Wyandank Pharaoh brought a third suit on behalf of the tribe in 1906. The named defendants were: Jane Ann Benson and Mary Benson, the executrices of Arthur Benson's will, John J. Pierrepoint and Henry R. Hoyt, the executors and trustees of Frank Sherman Benson's will, Mary Benson, the Montauk Company, the Montauk Dock and Improvement Company, Alfred W. Hoyt, the Montauk Extension Railroad Company, and the Long Island Rail Road. An area of was named in the third complaint ( of it adjacent to the LIRR).
Chief Pharaoh was represented by Maas and Lawrence W. Trowbridge (of counsel). The defendants were represented by Daly, Hoyt & Mason (for the Bensons), Austin & McLanahan (for the Dock and Improvement Co.), A. T. Mason (for Pierrepoint and Henry Hoyt), P. Tecumseh Sherman (for Alfred Hoyt), and Joseph Keany (for the LIRR). According to a 1910 Q&A in the "New York Times", the lawyers fees were "long since supposed to have eclipsed the value of the land in litigation." 
The trial took place, without a jury, before Judge Abel Blackmar of the Supreme Court of Suffolk County, Special Term. Fourteen of the sixteen living Montauk men appeared as witnesses at trial.
Judge Blackmar, ruled against the Montauks on October 11, 1910. According to Blackmar, the Montauks individually conveyed all their lands and claims to Arthur Benson between 1885 and 1894, in exchange for $100 to $250 each, except for Wyandank Pharaoh who received only $10, plus between in Freetown and East Hampton, plus a $240 annuity to be divided per capita.
Judge Blackmar also relied upon a December 1686 patent granted by Governor Thomas Dongan to the freeholders of East Hampton, granting them the exclusive right to purchase Indian lands in the area. Benson had separately purchased the fee rights from the descendants of the patentees.
Judge Blackmar also held that the Montauks were no longer a tribe:
During this long period the number of the Indians was greatly reduced. Their blood became so mixed that in many of them Indian traits were obliterated. They had no internal government, and they lived a sort of shiftless life, hunting, fishing, cultivating the ground 'Indian fashion' as a witness called it, and often leaving for long periods and working in some menial capacity for the whites.
On appeal, the Montauks found a new lawyer: Allen Caruthers.
The Appellate Division—composed of Judges Jenks, Burr, Rich, Stapleton, and Putnam—affirmed on October 16, 1914. On appeal, the Montauks were represented by Allen Caruthers, while the defendants were represented by Charles K. Carpenter, with Alexander T. Mason and George T. Austin on the brief. Judge Burr, for a unanimous court, wrote the opinion.
The Court of Appeals—composed of Chief Judge Frank Harris Hiscock and Judges Emory A. Chase, Frederick Collin, William Herman Cuddeback, John W. Hogan, McLaughlin, and Frederick E. Crane—affirmed (per curiam, without opinion) on January 29, 1918, without costs.
Aftermath.
Federal lobbying.
Maas departed for Washington, D.C. after the passage of the state enabling legislation. The Interior Department endorsed the idea on July 7, 1906.
In January 1921, Senator James Wolcott Wadsworth, Jr. (R-NY) and Representative Homer P. Snyder (R-NY) introduced legislation and asked the Interior Secretary to report to Congress on the Montauk's tribal status and the merits of their land claim. The Secretary prepared a report agreeing with the conclusions of Judge Blackmar and the New York appellate courts in "Pharaoh v. Benson". The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs received the report on April 22, 1922 and introduced the Wadsworth bill that June; the bill did not make it out of committee.
In 1996, represented by Bell, Boyd & Lloyd, the Montauks filed a letter of intent with the Branch of Acknowledgement and Research of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the first step towards federal recognition. The petition for recognition was submitted on June 23, 1998. The tribe received a request for documents from the BIA in January 1999.
State lobbying.
On February 14, 1922, New York state assemblyman John J. O'Connor introduced legislation to compensate the Montauks. The bill excluded James Waters and the other members of the Montauk diaspora. The bill would have created a three person committee—composed to two assembly members and one state senator—to determine whether the land claim had been meritorious. The bill never reached the floor.
Montaukett burial grounds.
In 1983, Fort Hill Associates and Signal Hill Associates applied to the town of East Hampton for a permit to build homes on North Neck hill, above the Montauk's ancestral burial ground. As quoted in the "New York Times", the East Hampton town supervisor said, "Who cares about a bunch of dead Indians?" The Montauketts won a temporary injunction in court that July. That November, the town board voted to purchase the for $1.4 million and preserve the burial ground.
In 1989, developers announced plans touching on a different Montaukett burial ground in North Neck. After protests, the town government agreed to preserve the site in 1991.
State parks.
In 1984, the federal government announced plans to sell Montauk Air Force Station, a air force installation south of Montauk Point, to real estate developers. New York State and the Town of East Hampton sued to block the sale. The land was eventually turned over to the New York State Park Service, becoming Camp Hero State Park. The state purchased of Hither Woods in 1986 and created Hither Hills State Park. In 1988, the state purchased more to augment the park.

List of Maidstone United F.C. managers

The following is a list of managers of Maidstone United Football Club and their honours from the reformation of the club in 1992 to the present day.
History.
Maidstone's first managers since reformation were Bill Tucker and Jack Whiteley, who were appointed in a joint role. Maidstone joined the Kent County League Division Four for the 1993-94 season and won the league at the first attempt. Tucker and Whiteley's team also won the West Kent Challenge Shield and the Tunbridge Wells Charity Cup. In their second season they managed to win the Kent County League Division Two title (Maidstone moved from Division Four to Division Two thanks to restructuring) and the Kent Junior Cup, and also reached the final of the West Kent Challenge Shield. However, Tucker and Whiteley could not get Maidstone promoted to the County League Premier Division, and Maidstone went through a succession of managers before finally winning promotion in 1999. Graham Martin was appointed in the wake of Tucker and Whiteley in 1996, but lasted less than a year before being replaced by Mickey Chatwin and Chad Andrews, with Maidstone again opting to employ joint managers. However Chatwin and Andrews did not last the season and were replaced by Nicky Chappell, before Mark Irvine took over for the 1997-98 season. Irvine was not the man to bring success to the Stones either, and he was succeeded by Jason Lillis. Lillis won the Kent County League First Division and got Maidstone promoted to the Premier Division. 
In the 1999 close season Lillis was replaced by Matt Toms. Toms led his side to a 3rd place finish and the team also picked up the Weald of Kent Charity Cup. In the 2000-01 season Toms saw his side finish first and win the Weald of Kent Charity Cup, but more importantly his side gained senior status and were elevated to the Kent League Premier Division. Jim Ward took over from Toms in the 2001 close season and led Maidstone to the Kent League title, his side also picking up the Kent League Premier Division Cup. However, Maidstone could not be promoted due to lease problems at their 'home' ground in Sittingbourne. In the 2002-03 season Maidstone won the Kent League Charity Shield and the Kent Senior Trophy, and finished 2nd in the league. Mal Walkins took over from Ward in December 2003, but a disappointing finish of 4th saw him replaced by Lloyd Hume in 2004. Hume won the Kent League and the Kent League Premier Division Cup in his second season in charge, and his side were promoted to the Isthmian League Division One South in April 2006. In the pre season of that year Alan Walker was promoted from Hume's assistant to joint manager, and together they won the 2006-07 Isthmian One South title, gaining promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division. Hume and Alan Walker registered two lower table finishes before resigning in early 2010. Reserve team manager Peter Nott took over and kept Maidstone from relegation, but was sacked in October 2010 after a poor start to the 2010-11 season. Nott was replaced by Andy Ford, who lasted under six months before resigning with Maidstone rooted to the bottom of the Isthmian Premier Division. Club captain Jay Saunders was appointed as caretaker manager and masterminded an astounding upturn in the team's fortunes, winning 5 of his nine games in charge. However, it was not enough to save the club from relegation. Saunders was subsequently appointed the club's permanent manager in May 2011.

<doc id="31206456" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31206456" title="Seismicity of the Sumatra coast">
Seismicity of the Sumatra coast

Seismicity of the Sumatran coast identifies and describes the seismic activity of an area of western Indonesia near the island of Sumatra. Seismicity refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time. The Sumatran coast is in the subduction zone where the Indian plate meets the Burma plate beneath the Andaman Sea, forming the northern part of the Sunda trench. The shallow seismicity is characteristically distributed across a wide area of plate movement. The Sunda trench is also closely related to the Sumatran Fault, a transform fault running the entire length of the island. 
History.
Significant events which devastated coastal communities in the 20th and 21st centuries include:
The seismicity of the Sumatra coast and the top six quakes ever recorded appear to be clustered in two time periods: a 12-year span between 1952 and 1964 and a 7-year span between the 2004 and 2011; however, this is understood as a statistical anomaly. 
The phenomenon comparably large quakes that happen on the same or neighbouring faults within months of each other can be explained by a sound geological mechanism -- for example, the three quakes close succession: in April 2010 (7.8 magnitude), in May 2010 (7.2 magnitude) and October 2010 (7.7 magnitude). However, this does not fully demonstrate a relationship between events separated by longer periods and greater distances. Much of the massive offshore seismicity have been highly tsunamigenic, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives along the coast and the entire rim of the Indian Ocean

In 1959, Jaime Gil de Biedma, a wealthy poet from Barcelona, is visiting Manila on business trip as director of the Philippine Tobacco Company. At night, the poet gives free rein to his homosexuality. He meets Johnny, a young man who works in an erotic nightclub, and they have sex. The poverty of Manila makes a deep impression on Jaime and heightens his social conscience. 
Back in Barcelona, the Spanish police interrogate Jaime about some of his subversive friends who are still dreaming of regime change in Spain. Ironically Jaime is refused membership in the Communist Party because he is gay. He visits his friend and editor Carlos Barral, and meets Juan Marsé, a young writer about to publish his first novel. Jaime is trying to save his relationship with Luis, his lover, but although in love with him, Jaime treats Luis, who is of humble background, with contempt. After a heated argument Luis leaves him for good. Describing himself as "a Sunday poet with a Monday conscience", Jaime mixes his weekly working days for his family's company with a bohemian lifestyle on weekends. Don Luis, Jaime's father, takes care of Jaime's troubles with the police, but he warns his son he has to sort his life out because he is putting his family and the business in jeopardy. 
By the mid 1960s, Jaime favorite spot is the Bocaccio nightclub where he meets the sexy and enigmatic Bel, a divorced woman with two kids. They quickly establish a relationship. Bel is entangled in a bitter battle with her ex-husband for the custody of her children. Jaime buys an apartment and asks Bel to marry him, but she turns him down. They are two free spirits, getting married would condemn their relationship to failure. Overwhelmed by the events, Jaime loses himself in the night and gets drunk. That same night, Bel dies in a tragic accident. When he hears the news, Jaime, in despair, tries to take his own life. He manages to get back on his feet with the support of friends and family. However, Jaime will never write poetry again. At the beginning of the 1970s, Jaime goes to the Philippines and has to deal with the economic changes which the company is going through under Ferdinand Marcos's dictatorship.
On his return, Jaime meets Toni, a young assistant of photography of humble background, and they begin a sentimental relationship. In spite of his class awareness, he seems to be attracted to men of lower background. Toni, for his part, insists on learning all he can from Jaime and asks him to introduce him into his sophisticated world. One day, at the beach with Tony and some friends, Jaime is move to tears watching the freshness of a girl dancing with Tony. As a middle-aged poet, Jaime is painfully aware of the passage of time, his misspent youth, and the death that patiently awaits him. He writes in a poem: "What do you want now, youth, you impudent delight of life?," "What brings you to the beach? We old ones were content until you came along to wound us by reviving the most fearful of impossible dreams. You come to rummage through our imaginations." 
Jaime's father dies and events pile up. The growing tension between Jaime and Toni leads to a violent confrontation in the country house which Jaime has bought as their love nest. Toni throws him out, and Jaime trips and is injured in the snow. He almost dies. "The fact that life was to be taken seriously we understand only later", he narrates in another poem, "Like all young people, I was going to change the world. I wanted to make my mark and withdraw to applause. Growing old, dying, it was all a question of the size of the theater. But time has passed and I see the unpleasant truth. Growing old, dying, is the play's only plot."
Years later, old and tired, Jaime lives out his days with a young stage actor. He finds out that he has AIDS. The passing of time and illness have left their mark on him. His friends, who know that Jaime is dying, organize a poetry recital at Madrid's famous Students Residence, which turns into a public acclamation of the poet. Although old and approaching death, he still yearns for youth and beauty. He hires a young male prostitute, but in a hotel room he can only passively observe the young naked man dancing to The Pet Shop Boys's song "Always on My Mind".

The film generally received good reviews. It was nominated to six Goya Awards including best actor for Jordi Mollà, but did not win any.
The film caused a stir in Spain, with the real-life Juan Marse, now a revered novelist, expressing his strong indignation in the national press. He referred to The Consul of Sodom as "grotesque, ridiculous, phony, absurd, dirty, pedantic, directed by an incompetent and ignorant fool, badly acted, with deplorable dialogue. It's a shameless film, with an infamous title and produced by unscrupulous people."
