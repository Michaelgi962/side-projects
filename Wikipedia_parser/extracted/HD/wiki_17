Sledge hockey classification

Sledge hockey classification is the classification process for people who play ice sledge hockey. The classification system is governed by the International Paralympic Committee Ice Sledge Hockey.
Definition.
People with cerebral palsy in classifications from CP3 to CP5 are covered by sledge hockey classifications.
Unlike skiing, there is a sport specific approach to classification for hockey. It includes a medical examination.
For wheelchair hockey, there is only one class. Competitors go through a classification test to determine if they are eligible.
The Canadian Paralympic Committee says of sledge hockey, "To participate in IPC competitions and sanctioned events (i.e. Paralympic Winter Games), athletes must have an impairment of permanent nature in the lower part of the body of such a degree that it makes ordinary skating, and consequently ice hockey playing, impossible. Examples include amputation, spinal cord injury, joint immobility, cerebral palsy and leg shortening of at least 7cm and 'les autres.'"
Governance.
The sport is governed by the International Paralympic Committee Ice Sledge Hockey. While the CP-ISRA has an interest in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy, it is not governed by them.
Eligibility.
Eligible ice hockey players need to have a permanent lower body physical impairment that prevents them from skating normally. People with chronic lower body pain are not eligible based on existing classifications.
History.
The sport was created in Sweden during the 1960s. The sport was one sports people with disabilities were more likely to play during the 1990s.
Prior to 1988, the classification assessment process generally involved a medical exam to determine the classification. The change in winter disability sport classification towards a more formal functional classification system happened more quickly as a result of changes being made in wheelchair basketball classification that started in 1983.
In 2002, for the Winter Paralympics, the Games Classifiers were Bjorn Hedman, Irv Grosfield, Carin Njorne and Michael Riding.
The Working Group was established by the IPC in early 2005 to improve on winter sport classification to insure it is as applicable as possible across all winter sports and all levels of competition. The Working Group was to report back to the IPC following the 2006 Winter Paralympics.
Process.
For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport is not supported by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.
At the Paralympic Games.
At the 1976 Winter Paralympics, only amputee competitors were at the Paralympics when the sport was included as demonstration sport.
At the 1992 Winter Paralympics, wheelchair disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the International Paralympic Committee. The sport made its full Paralympic debut at the 1994 Winter Paralympics.
At the 1994 Winter Paralympics, it was included as a full Paralympic sport for the first time.
Future.
Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

Disability classification in judo

Disability judo classification is the medical classification system for disability judo. Judokas with a disability are classified into different categories based on their disability type. The classification is handled by the Blind Sports Association.
Definition.
The blind classifications are based on medical classification, no functional classification.
Beyond the level of vision impairment, research done at the Central Institute on Employment Abilities of the Handicapped in Moscow has found differences in functional capabilities based on differences in visual acuity. This does not play a significant role in judo.
Governance.
The sport's classification system is governed by the International Blind Sports Association.
Eligibility.
, people with visual disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. The sport is also open to blind people with hearing loss.
History.
In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport.
Classes.
Classes for the sport are based on weight, not based on functional disability. B1, B2 and B3 athletes compete with each other in their own weight divisions. Men have seven weight divisions and women have six.
B1 competitors, those with the most severe vision problems, have a red 7" diameter circle attached on both sleeves. This identifier makes it easier for referees to spot B1 competitors and give them certain allowances (for example, B1 athletes cannot be expected to see the competition area boundaries). Competitors who are deaf have a small blue circle on the their judogi's bib on the back in the right hand corner.
Process.
For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport is not supported by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions. At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, on the spot classification required that classifiers have access to medical equipment like Snellen charts, reflex hammers, and goniometers to properly classify competitors.
At the Paralympic Games.
The sport was first played as a medal sport at the 1988 Summer Paralympics.
At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, blind people were eligible to participate, with classification being run through IBSA, with classification being done based on weight. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 10 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 1 class change.
Judo competition at the London 2012 Summer Olympics will be held at ExCeL Exhibition Centre from 30 August to 1 September. There will be 13 medal events, and each country may only enter one athlete per event. The total number of athletes per country allowed is six men and five women. Being the host nation, Great Britain is allowed another two competitors (one male, one female).
Future.
Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

<doc id="36583576" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36583576" title="Boccia classification">
Boccia classification

Boccia classification is the classification system governing boccia, a sport designed specifically for people with disabilities. Classification is handled by Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association. There are four classifications for this sport.
Definition.
Boccia classification at the Paralympic Games is the basis for determining who can compete in the sport, and within which class. It is used for the purposes of establishing fair competition. Entry is eligible to athletes with cerebral palsy or severe disabilities (such as muscular dystrophy, brain or spinal injury). There are four boccia classifications based upon functional ability. This sport has rules that were designed specifically with people with disabilities in mind.
Governance.
In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). This remained the case in 2012.
History.
In 1983 CP-ISRA was responsible for the classification of competitors in Boccia. Their classification followed the system designed for field athletics events and originally used five cerebral palsy classes for competitors. Class 1 competitors could compete in co-ed team events which included three competitors from class 1 and class 2, with one required to be a class 1 competitor. They could also compete in the individual events. In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for many disability sports.
Eligibility.
, people with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. The level of physical impairment must be significant, such as brain injury or total body impaired function (as in the case of cerebral palsy). In 1983, CP-ISRA set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible ybless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres.
Classes.
There are four classes in Boccia. Athletes are grouped according to their impairment as follows:
Process.
For a boccia athlete to compete at the Paralympic Games, international classification by an International Classification Panel is required. The International Classification Panel will allocate a class to the athlete and rule which (if any) assistive equipment the athlete may use. Their ruling overrides all prior classifications including those of a national basis. Athletes must be classified according to their disability and level of impairment. The classification process normally involves a physical assessment to authenticate the disability and evaluate the degree of limitation. The athlete will be observed in competition action. Results will place the athlete in one of the four classes (see Classes): this evaluation cannot be used for sports outside of Boccia. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.
At the Paralympic Games.
At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, cerebral palsy disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through CP-ISRA, with classification based on disability type. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 7 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 0 class changes. 1 PNS protest was filed and the classification was upheld. Boccia competition at the London 2012 Summer Olympics will be held at ExCeL Exhibition Centre from 2 September to 8 September. Competition play is mixed: 104 men and women will compete for seven medal events. In each team event, one team of three athletes per country is allowed.
Future.
Going forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.

Warren Weir

Warren Weir (born October 1989) is a Jamaican sprinter, who specializes in the 200 metres. He was the bronze medallist in the event at the 2012 London Olympics, helping Jamaica sweep the medals. In 2013 at the Moscow World Championships, Warren Weir won the silver medal equaling his personal best. He finished behind Usain Bolt who set a World Leading time. His current personal best is 19.79 seconds set at the National Stadium in his home country Kingston, Jamaica. He has since equalled his personal best in Moscow, in the World Championship final. He trains with the Glen Mills-coached Racers Track Club, alongside Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake.
Career.
At the start of his career, Weir competed in the short sprints and the 110 metres hurdles. Born in Trelawny Parish, he ran the 100 m and 200 m for Calabar High School at the Jamaican High School Championships. At the 2007 Jamaican junior championships he set a hurdles best of 13.65 seconds for second place and set a 100 m dash best of 10.69 seconds. He was a hurdles finalist at the 2007 Pan American Junior Athletics Championships and a silver medallist at the 2008 CARIFTA Games, where he also shared in the 4×100 metres relay gold medal. In his first appearance on the global stage, Weir reached the semi-finals at the 2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics. He competed sparingly in his first years as a senior, although he did run personal bests in the 100 m (10.50) and the 400 metres hurdles (53.28) in 2009.
Weir began to emerge as a 200 m specialist in 2011 after joining the Racers Track Club under coach Glen Mills. He and Mills noticed that the hurdles were leaving him with knee pain and both decided that Weir should focus on sprinting instead. He dipped under 21 second for the first time and placed sixth at the Jamaican Championships. He was invited to European meetings for the first time and performed well at his first Diamond League meeting, taking second place to Walter Dix with a personal best of 20.43 seconds into a strong headwind. He began 2012 by bringing his 200 m best down to 20.21, then 20.13 seconds. A time of 20.08 seconds brought him third place at the Adidas Grand Prix in New York in June.
At the Jamaican Olympic Trials in 2012, Weir broke twenty seconds with a personal best of 19.99 seconds in the 200 m semi final and a third place finish in the final, behind Yohan Blake and Usain Bolt, earned him a spot on the Jamaican team for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In the Olympic 200 m final he was a surprise bronze medallist, securing a new personal best of 19.84 seconds in the process. His medal made it an all-Jamaican podium finish alongside fellow Racers Track Club athletes Bolt and Blake – the first time Jamaica had achieved such a medal sweep at the Olympics.
Weir started out his 2013 season with a victory of 20.11 seconds in the Adidas Grand Prix in New York. In June, he registered a 10.02 100m run, a massive personal best from his previous record of 10.51 seconds in 2008. Later in the 2013 Jamaican National Championships, Weir cruised to the finish line in the 200m final in 19.79 seconds, tying Bolt's world leading mark at that point. Having won the first two of his diamond league 200m races (in the Golden Grand Prix and the Adidas Grand Prix), Weir finished second to Bolt at the Meeting Areva, where Bolt set a world lead and meeting record of 19.73. Despite the clear loss to Bolt in Paris, Weir looked to be the closest to a challenger for Bolt at the World Championships that year. At the London Anniversary Games Weir clocked an impressive 19.89 and followed this up with a meeting record in the relay, clocking 37.75.
Come the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, Weir took the heats easily and made it to the final. In the final, Bolt won the race in a world leading time of 19.66 to become the first man to win the 200m at the world championships three times. Weir got clear silver at 19.79, equalling his best, and Curtis Mitchell the bronze in 20.04. Weir would later collect a gold in the 4x100m, after running in the heats. Weir finished his season off by winning the 200m at the Memorial Van Damme in Brussels and hence successfully won the Diamond League.
He is known for saying "No English, straight Patois," sparking calls on social networks for T-shirts to be printed with the phrase.

Gray's General Store was a general store located at 4 Main Street in Adamsville, Rhode Island. Founded in 1788, it operated for almost 225 years and was reputed to be the oldest continually operating general store in the United States.
The store featured an old-fashioned marble soda fountain, cigar and tobacco cases, and Rhode Island johnny cakes. In 2007, U.S. Senator Jack Reed and then-Governor Donald Carcieri issued proclamations naming Gray's as the oldest continuously run general store in the country. The store was owned and operated by the same family since 1879, entailing seven generations. Gray's also was the location of the first post office in Little Compton, founded in 1804.
Gray's closed its doors on Sunday, July 29, 2012 after the death of its proprietor due lack of interest in keeping the store open by relatives, citing that "the shop's finances aren't sustainable and a supermarket down the street has siphoned away business." 
The store re-opened in the Summer of 2013 after a year-long hiatus.

The A. H. Maegly House is a house located in southwest Portland, Oregon, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is located in the upscale Arlington Heights neighborhood. Built for Aaron H. Maegly (born 1854), a wealthy Portland broker, the distinctive house was completed in 1915. It was designed by Portland architect John Virginius Bennes, in the Prairie School style, an architectural style that is rare in Oregon.
The house is constructed of reinforced concrete, covered by stucco, and has a red tile roof. Among the features of the Maegly House that are often included in Prairie School-style dwellings are decorative corner brackets and ornamental friezes, above and below the second-floor windows. One narrow frieze positioned just below the eaves encircles the entire house except where interrupted at the corners by the decorative brackets. The interior is noteworthy for its use of high-quality Honduran mahogany. Every room in the house has multiple windows, and every ground-floor room opens to a porch or terrace. Downtown Portland and Mount Hood can be seen from the living room, dining room and kitchen. The home is surrounded by a garden notable for its collection of Japanese maples, planted by Aaron Maegly's wife. A circular brick driveway leads to a porte-cochère.

Leap Confronting Conflict

Established in 1987 by British Quaker Alec Davison, Leap Confronting Conflict is a UK-Based educational and skills charity who prevent the escalation of everyday conflict into destructive behaviour and violence by giving young people and the professionals that work with them the skills to understand the causes and consequences of conflict.
Leap Confronting Conflict was the winner of the Civil Society's Charity of the Year in 2009
History.
Leap was launched in 1987 with the support of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Quaker Peace Committee; in the following year the charity received three years of funding from the Department for Education and Science. Published in 1992, Leap’s first training manual entitled “Playing with Fire” sold out and was subsequently published by the New Society Press in the United States of America. This was followed by a handbook for young people entitled Fireworks! in 1993
In 1999, Leap Confronting Conflict became an independent registered charity and launched the Young Mediators Network (YMN) whilst Leap’s Quarrel Shop became the first Leap project to gain formal OCN accreditation. 2002 saw Leap expand their outreach to Glasgow as they launched their first gang project in the city. The organisation’s conference “Gangs! What Gangs?” delivered in 2003 was marked by a major piece in The Guardian.
The Institute for Public Policy Research recommended Leap’s work in educational institutions in 2006 as Leap published it manual, “Working with Gangs and Young People”. The following year saw the charities expansion as Leap recruited regional staff in Yorkshire and the South West following which the Department for Children, School and families awarded the charity Pathfinder status
At the 2009 Charity Awards, Leap had the honour of being the Overall winner as well as winning the Children and Youth Category. As of 2010, Leap is now working with over 8,500 young people, 1,600 adults and 200 organisations each year
Mission, Values & Core Principles.
Leap's vision is a nation of young people constructively managing conflict in their communities. Leap believes that conflict is inevitable in the lives of young people; however managed creatively can be an opportunity for personal development. Leap has therefore developed innovative and accessible models for understanding and managing conflict. Leap has a set of core principles which form the foundation of their work – developing potential, being responsible, creating communication and developing community.
Activities and Programs.
Leap works nationally with young people and adults, helping them to understand and manage the everyday conflict in their lives, and supporting them to become role models and leaders of positive change.
Leap has innovated many programs in conflict resolution which include Peerlink, a national peer mediation and youth conflict resolution network and support project; Quarrel Shop, a training course for 16- to 21-year-olds in peer mediation and conflict resolution and Working with Gangs, a course based on training and research in the area of gangs and territorialism in communities around the UK.
Leap is currently working in conjunction with Leeds Metropolitan University to develop a Level 4 Certificate in Youth and Conflict which will study the factors behind conflict and develop skills whilst working with young people.
Media.
On 20 November 2011; Leap was the feature of a BBC Lifeline documentary, originally broadcast on BBC One. The ten-minute documentary gave an overview of Leap's work and featured Brooke Kinsella, sister of the violence victim Ben Kinsella and notable for her role in television soap EastEnders, making an emotional plea on behalf of Leap Confronting Conflict.

Alice Eaves Scenic Reserve

Alice Eaves Scenic Reserve, known colloquially as "Eaves Bush", is 16ha forest located at the northern end of Orewa. It is named after Mrs Alice Caroline Eaves (d. 1955), whose family bequeathed the land to the nation in 1960.
Historical Background.
The area was previously a defensive Pa, built by Te Kawerau sub-tribes, occupied until as recently as 1827. The Ngai Paoa Tribe ceded the land to the Crown on 5 January 1854, which was subsequently granted to an Austrian, Captain Martin Krippner, in 1860.
In the 1870s, Major de Grut took over the land until it was sold to the Eaves family in 1919.
Features.
A series of pedestrian walkways have been constructed through the reserve, as well as a wooden look out point over Orewa Beach that was built in 1997.
The reserve includes kauri trees as old as 300 years. In addition, the bush contains native trees such as Tōtara, Mataī, Kahikatea, Puriri, Rātā, Karaka, Rimu, Rewarewa, Nikau and Taraire. A number of these trees can be identified by labels along the walkway.
Several small streams feed the Nukumea Stream, which marks the reserve's southern boundary.

<doc id="36584061" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36584061" title="Sculptures of Bangladesh">
Sculptures of Bangladesh

Sculptures have been an indispensable part of Bangladeshi culture. The earliest sculptures in Bangladesh discovered so far date back to the 3rd century BC. Since the ancient times, sculptures have been serving as a substantial manifestation of the profound heritage of Bangladeshi culture and history.
Historic significance.
Sculptures have been a key a source of rendering the historic identity of the ancient Bangladesh. Even though the art of sculptures in Bangladesh began almost 2500 years ago, it mostly flourished during the Gupta, Pala and Sena dynasty all of which belong to the early Middle Ages (1-1200 CE).
Gupta Sculptures.
The Gupta rulers were devoted Vaishnavas, and early Gupta sculptures are found to be mostly representations of Vishnu or any of his incarnations. The earliest example of this seems to be the Vishnu from Machmoil Bagmara in the district of Rajshahi carved in gray sandstone. The image shows a broken form of the god in a strict frontally standing pose. Though modeling and iconic features betray its early Gupta style, its aesthetic attainment is so negligible that it may be stylistically placed in a point of transition between the Kusana and the Gupta phases. The image is preserved with quite a number of other Vishnus of the Gupta period in the Varendra Research Museum. The Gupta sculptures of Bangladesh are mostly icons and their forms were determined by the characteristics of the gods as prescribed by the priests of Central India.
Pala Sculptures.
During more than four hundred years of Pala rule (8th-12th century AD), many centers of sculptural art flourished simultaneously in different regions of the extensive empire of Bangladesh. The products of these centers were not only varied but also numerous. Thousands of sculptures of this period have been discovered and they now form part of the collections of a number of museums in Bangladesh. Many of them have also found their ways into a number of museums in Europe and America. Most of these sculptures have been found through the excavations in Somapura Mahavihara. Pala sculpture derives its origins from the late Gupta style, but later on deviated from it.
Sena sculptures.
A large number of sculptures representing Hindu gods and goddesses belong to the phase of artistic activity initiated under the Sena rulers (c 1097-1223 AD). From the artistic point of view, Sena sculpture is a continuation of the Pala style in vogue till the late 11th century AD. The slender body form of the late Pala period sculpture is retained in the Sena period, but the modeling quality shows a marked deterioration.
Materials.
Most of the ancient sculptures discovered in Bangladesh are made of terracotta, bronze, black stone etc. The earliest sculptures were made of terracotta dating back as early as 3rd century BC. The trend of using bronze for sculptures started from the 7th century. The black stone sculptures also originated from that period.
Terracotta.
The history of terracotta sculpture in Bangladesh starts from the Mauryan age (324-187 BC). It is believed that in pre-Mauryan times it was the Matrika (Mother-Goddess) statues that dominated. From the presentation and aesthetic standard of the Mauryan sculpture it can be inferred that the art had a long and continuous heritage. These sculptures became much more elegant, refined, well-shaped and worldly in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.
Bronze.
The trend of using bronze in sculptures started in the 7th century CE mainly from the Chittagong region. As the region was dominated by believers of Buddhism, most of these earliest bronze sculptures were depictions of Gautam Buddha. However, later on sculptures depicting the Hindu deities were also made with bronze.
Black stone.
Stone sculptures so far discovered from Bangladesh that are assignable to the first three centuries of the Common era are few. These sculptures in general represent a style, which is, in the development of the art in North India, recognised as related to the Kusanas. The centre of the art was Mathura, where evolved during the period the images of the deities worshipped by the followers of the three major religions of the time, namely, Brahmanism, Buddhism and Jainism.
Religious depictions.
The Bangladeshi sculptures, especially those belonging to the ancient and early Middle Ages mostly depict the Hindu deities and the deities worshiped by the Buddhists, especially Gautam Buddha. Thus, these sculptures can be divided in two major categories considering their religious significance.
Hindu Sculptures.
Sculptures depicting the Hindu deity fall in this category. The beginning of the art of Hindu sculptures is believed to be from the Gupta period. Most of these sculptures depicts the Hindu deity called Vishnu. Many of them also depict the deities namely Durga, Brahma, Ganesha and others. Mahishamardini figure from Sarsabaz, Bogra, now in the Mahasthangarh Museum is the most magnificent early image of the deity not only from Bangladesh but from the Indian Subcontinent.
Buddhist sculptures.
These sculptures mostly depict the Gautam Buddha and Buddhist believes. The oldest Buddhist sculptures in Bangladesh are believed to be the belongings of the ancient kingdom of Pundravardhana. These sculptures are discovered from the archaeological sites, most of which situated in the Rajshahi and Rangpur region of the country.
Modern Sculptures.
Sculptures, created after the independence of Bangladesh can be referred as modern sculptures. Most of these sculptures depict the gallant struggle of Bangladeshis during the Bangladesh liberation war. Some notable sculptures depicting the liberation war are Aparajeyo Bangla, Shabash Bangladesh, Jagroto Chowrongi etc. Nitun Kundu, Mrinal Haque are some of the notable modern sculptors.

Multimedia Studies

Multimedia Studies is an interdisciplinary field of academic discourse focused on the understanding of technologies and cultural dimensions of linking traditional media sources with ones based on new media to support social systems.
History.
Multimedia Studies as a discipline came out of the need for media studies to be made relevant to the new world of CD-ROMs and hypertext in the 1990s. Revolutionary books like Jakob Nielsen's 'Hypertext and Hypermedia' book lay the foundations for understanding multimedia alongside traditional cognitive science and interface design issues. Software like Authorware Attain, now owned by Adobe, made the design of multimedia systems accessible to those unskilled in programming and became major applications by the end of the 1990s
Recent Challenges.
The Internet age that has been growing since the launch of Windows 98 has brought new challenges for the discipline including developing new models and rules for the World Wide Web. Areas such as usability have had to develop specific guidelines for Website design and traditional concepts like genre, narrative theory, and stereotypes have had to be updated to take account of Cyberculture. Cultural aspects of Multimedia Studies have been conceptualised by authors such as Lev Manovich, Arturo Escobar and Fred Forest.
The increase in Internet trolling and so-called Internet addiction has thrown up new problems for the field to tackle, such as whether it is down to legal issues or the management of websites themselves. Concepts like emotional design and affective computing are driving Multimedia Studies research to consider ways of becoming more seductive and able to take account of the different needs of users.
Media Studies 2.0.
Some academics, such as David Gauntlett, have preferred the neologism, 'Media Studies 2.0' to Multimedia Studies, in order to give it the feel of other fields like Web 2.0 and Classroom 2.0. 
The Media Studies 2.0 neologism has received strong criticism. Andy Medhurst at Sussex University for instance wrote of the Media Studies 2.0 neologism introduced by David Gauntlett, 'Isn't it odd that whenever someone purportedly identifies a new paradigm, they see themselves as already a leading practitioner of it?'

Heatwave (Wiley song)

"Heatwave" is a single from British grime artist Wiley, featuring vocals from Ms D - known for singing on the Chipmunk song "Oopsy Daisy". It was released as the lead single from his eighth studio album "The Ascent" on 27 July 2012 for digital download in the United Kingdom. It was written by Wiley, Dayo Olatunji and produced by Rymez, who is unofficially credited as a featured artist. "Heatwave" received major radio airplay, while managing to enter on BBC Radio 1's A-list. The song debuted at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart on 5 August 2012, selling over 114,000 copies, while becoming Wiley's first ever solo number 1.
Music video.
A music video to accompany the release of "Heatwave" was first released onto YouTube on 29 June 2012 at a total length of three minutes and twenty-one seconds.
Critical reception.
Lewis Corner of "Digital Spy" blog gave the song a neutral review stating:
"Long nights are crazy we are on them/ My name's Wiley, play my song then," the wordsmith demands over rousing strings and crowd-pleasing claps, before dropping into a swirl of electronic squiggles perfect for a beach-based booty shake-off. The result is a suitably cool summer jam, but if Wiley really wants to make an impact like his peers, he's going to have to dial the temperature up just a little bit higher yet. .
Chart performance.
"Heatwave" was number 1 on the Wednesday and Friday UK midweek chart. As predicted, the song entered the UK Singles Chart on 5 August 2012 at number 1, spending two weeks there (holding off "We'll Be Coming Back" by Calvin Harris and Example). "Heatwave" sold over 114,000 copies in its first week of release and became Wiley's first ever solo number 1 single. In the second week of release, Wiley remained at number 1, selling another 66,000. The song has sold 416,000 copies in the UK as of December 2012, and was the 38th best-selling single of 2012.

Timpanogos Cave Historic District

The Timpanogos Cave Historic District consists of support and administration buildings built in the 1920s and 1930s in Timpanogos Cave National Monument, Utah, USA. These structures are notable examples of the National Park Service Rustic style, designed to fit with their environment. The earliest trails and structures were built by Errol M. Halliday while the location was still under the administration of the U.S. Forest Service. The Old Cave Trail was built in 1921-22. The stone storage building was built in the 1920s, together with a frame custodian's residence that no longer exists. A stone confort station (Building 126) was built in 1928. 
The National Park Service took over the site in 1933. Park facilities were expanded using labor provided by the Works Progress Administration, with another comfort station (Building 127) in 1939. The American Fork River was diverted and a new bridge was built in the 1930s. The Superintendent's Residence was completed in 1941.
Description.
The structures are scatted on a steep landscape. The most significant building is the superintendent's residence, of rubble stone construction with a log-framed roof, covered with green shingles.The bridge is a single span built in 1935, using rubble stone. The 1935 comfort station is built on a ledge on the mountainside, and has a nearly flat concrete roof faced with stone. The 1928 comfort station is larger and built with a shingled roof. It is no longer used as a comfort station. The rubble storage building is covered with a flat concrete roof. There are also two cold cellars on the site, both built about 1930. The trail climbs the cliffs for between one and , its vertical climb of supported by stone retaining walls.

Education in Mizoram

Education in Mizoram consists of a diverse array of formal education systems ranging from elementary to university, from training institution to technical courses. The Government of India imposes mandatory education at least up to the basic level. For this public schools are made free of fees, and provided with free textbooks and school lunch.
The first formal education was started in 1894 by two British Christian Missionaries at Aizawl. They taught only two select students whom they could trust for further teaching and their own evangelism. The first government school was started in 1897 at Aizawl. The first middle school opened in 1906, and secondary school in 1944. The first higher education institute Pachhunga University College was started in 1958. The first university Mizoram University was established in 2001 by the University Grants Commission of India.
The general pattern of education is simply a progression from primary to secondary education. Only after secondary level students are able to pursue their lines of career opportunities or preferences. Industrial Training Institute for craftmenship training courses (tailoring, mechanic, electrician, cooking, etc.) was started in Aizawl by the state government in 1964 (Mizoram was then under Assam state). Education on technical and vocational courses started only after 1980s. There are now various opportunities including engineering, veterinary, business management, technology, nursing, pharmacy, and other career oriented courses. The College of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Selesih was opened in 1997 as one of the constituent colleges of the Central Agricultural University. National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology, Aizawl was started by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in 2000. The Government of Mizoram established The Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India University, Mizoram in 2006. National Institute of Technology Mizoram was established in 2010 by the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India.
In spite of relatively late education system, as of the latest census in 2011, Mizoram is the second highest in literacy rate (91.58%) among the Indian states.
History.
Before the land of the Mizos was annexed to the British Empire in 1890, Mizos were without written language and were totally illiterate. Most of knowledge was disseminated at Zawlbuk, the traditional school. In 1894 two English missionaries of Arthington Aborigines Mission Dr. (Rev) J.H. Lorrain and Rev. F.W. Savidge arrived at Aizawl. They immediately worked on creating Mizo alphabets based on Roman script. After a stay of only two and half months, they started the first school on 1 April 1894. Their first and only pupils were Suaka and Thangphunga. The two teachers were surprised that their students mastered the new alphabets in a week. The first textbook "Mizo Zir Tir Bu (A Lushai Primer)" was released on 22 October 1895 and became the first book in Mizo language. A Welsh missionary Rev. D.E. Jones from the Calvinistic Methodist Mission then took up the education under government recognition in 1898. He organised classes for about thirty students at the verandah of his resisdence. He was assisted by Khasi couple Rai Bhajur and his wife. A new government school was opened in Lunglei in 1897, and Bengali script was used for teaching. In 1901 the government honoured Lalluava, the Chief of Khawngbâwk, for his deed towards the British by establishing primary school in his village. By 1903 there were schools in fifteen villages. In 1903 the British administration started promoting education by waiving forced labour (called "kuli") for those who passed class IV (primary school), in addition to scholarship for meritorious students and grants to existing schools. The first scholarship was given to 8 students with the amount of INR 3 each per month for 2 years. The first systematic examination called Lower Primary Exam was conducted on 25 June 1903, with 19 candidates (2 girl among 17 boys). Eleven of them passed. Sir Bamfield Fuller, Assam Chief Commissioner, visited Mizoram (then Lushai Hills) in February 1904, and was so impressed with the mission schools that he immediately issued an order for dissolution of all government schools. He also presented Gold Medal to Chhuahkhama (among boys) and Saii (among girls). In 1904 the entire educational administration was charged under the mission, and Rev. Edwind Rowlands became the first Honorary Inspector of Schools from 1 April. The first middle school (was called upper primary) came up in 1906 in Aizawl. The first high school named Mizo High School was opened in February 1944 at Zarkawt. There were 56 students in class VII, under the headmaster Rev David Evan Jones.
By 1941 Census of India Lushai had attained highest literacy rate (36%) in India. Till the late 1952 the church managed elementary education through Honorary Inspector of Schools. On 25 April 1952 Lushai Hills became Mizo District Council under the Government of Assam. A post of Deputy Inspector was created by the government. In 1953 the designation of Honoray Inspector was changed to Secretary, Education Management Committee. Under this administration all primary and middle scholarship examinations were coordinated. In 1953 the first teachers' training institute Basic Training Centre was opened. On 15 August 1958 Pachhunga University College (then Aijal College) was inaugurated to become the first institute of higher education. In 1961 Education Officer became the administrative authority of education in the Mizo District Council. After Mizoram became Union Territory (in 1972) a separate Directorate of Education was created in 1973 under a separate ministry. Mizoram Board of School Education was established in 1976. Within a hundred years of education, Mizoram remains at the top list of highest literacy rate in India.
School education.
The office of school education for Mizoram was started in 1973. It became a separate Directorate of School Education in 1989 and is located at McDonald Hill, Zarkawt, Aizawl. The department look after elementary, secondary, higher education, language development, adult education and physical education within the state. The directorate administers the entire state and divides into 4 (four) education districts, namely (1) Chhimtuipui district, (2) Lunglei district,(3) Aizawl East district, and (4) Aizawl West district. The structure of education in the state is based on the national level pattern with 12 years of schooling (10+2+3), consisting of eight years of elementary education, that is, five years of primary and three years of middle school education for the age groups of 6-11 and 11–14 years, respectively, followed by secondary and higher secondary education of two years each besides two years of pre-primary education. The entry age in class 1 is 5+. Pre-primary classes form age group 3 to 4. The higher secondary school certificate enables pupils to pursue studies either in universities or in colleges for higher education in general academic streams and in technical and professional course.
SCERT.
The Mizoram State Council of Educational Research & Training was started in January 1980. It is an academic wing of the Directorate of School Education and is located at Chaltlang since its establishment. SCERT is responsible for qualitative improvement of school education from primary to higher secondary schools, non-formal education and teacher education. It is also responsible for successful implementation of various education projects sponsored by central government, UNICEF as well as state government.

It is an authority on conducting state level examinations of schools. The Mizoram State Board of School Examination evaluates students' progress by conducting two board examinations-one at the end of class 10 and the other at the end of class 12.
Higher and technical education.

There are 20 colleges, 2 deficit colleges including one Aizawl Law College, two training colleges (B.Ed. Training College and Hindi Training College) and two polytechnics under its jurisdiction.

The Government of Mizoram adopted the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, and based on it has enacted its own Mizoram Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011. The rules demand compulsory schooling for children aged between 6 to 14 years, special training training for children in need of special development, provision of free textbooks and writing materials, free uniforms for BPL children.
SSA in Mizoram.
Mizoram state education department started implementing Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan from the financial year 2000-2001. Funds were utilised for various activities, such as conducting household survey, training of teachers, preparation of district plan, purchase of vehicles, etc. At the initial stage, when only Saiha district was selected for starting pre-project activities, there was no society constituted for this programme and no district committee was formed either. As a result, District Education Officer (DEO), Saiha and supporting staff in consultation with Directorate of School Education, carried out the pre-project activities. “The Mizoram Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Raja Mission Rules 2001” was passed by the Mizoram Legislative Assembly and the same was published in the Mizoram Gazette on 1 August 2001. In the same year the Mizoram Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan mission was registered under the societies registration (extension to Mizoram) Act 1976 (Mizoram Act No. 3 of 1977).

Article 8
So far as matters dealt with herein are concerned, this Treaty cancels all previous Treaties, agreements, and engagements entered into on behalf of India between the British Government and the Government of Nepal. 
This treaty is called unequal by some Nepalese. They claim that Nepalese law does not permit open border and Indians cannot buy lands and properties in Nepal and carry out businesses in their names. They claim that the 1950 treaty was signed by undemocratic rulers of Nepal and can be scrapped by a one year notice. The treaty has been unpopular in some segments of Nepal, who often regard it as a breach of its sovereignty.

The Line 4 of Wuhan Metro () is the third line in Wuhan Metro system, and it will be the second metro line crossing the Yangtze river in Wuhan. It is colored grass-green, which is the identifying color of this line, which would appear on its trains, station signs, and the official subway map. 
The whole construction was divided into two parts, being phase 1 and 2, which are expected to open around 2013 and 2014, respectively. Phase 1, opened on December 28, 2013, runs through Wuchang in a northeast-southwest direction, connecting Wuhan Railway Station, Wuchang Railway Station and major commercial districts. Phase 2 will run in an east-west direction, linking Hanyang and Wuchang, tunneling through the Yangtze river in the proximity of the first Yangtze river bridge and connecting with phase 1 at Wuchang Railway station.
The opening of phase 1 of Line 4 will form the skeleton of Wuhan's metro system. Right after its opening, the system (including Line 1, 2, and 4) will be able to accommodate millions of passengers a day, where a large proportion of them will be the cross-Yangtze passengers. But all stations on line 4 have been designed only to accommodate a six-car train (type B) in length and have no possibility to extend for future upgrading.
Stations.
Phase 1 stations are (from south to north): Wuchang Railway Station, Meiyuanxiaoqu, Zhongnanlu, Hongshan Guangchang, Zhoujiadawan, Qingyuzui, Dongting, Yuejiazui, Tiejicun, Luojiagang, Yuanlilu, Gongye Dadao, Gongyesilu, Yangchunhu, Wuhan Railway Station.

Thomas Smartt

Sir William Thomas Smartt (Ireland, 22 February 1858 - Cape Town, 17 April 1929) was a South African politician, and founder and leader of the Unionist Party.
He graduated in medicine at the University of Dublin in 1880 and left for South Africa where he went to Britstown as physician. A keen farmer, he later founded the Smartt Syndicate, one of the largest dams in the then Cape Colony at Houwater near Britstown. He kept good relationships with local farmers and was an enthusiastic member of the Afrikaner Bond.
Smartt was chairman of the commission called Scab in 1892 and the his report led to the Organisation nominating him as their candidate for the constituency in Wodehouse in the 1894 general election. He took his place in the Cape Legislative Assembly. In 1897, when Rhodes's government fell, Smartt was interior minister in Sir Gordon Sprigg's cabinet. In 1898 the Sprigg government also collapsed and Smartt was a member of the Legislative Assembly to be elected in Cathcart. With the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War in 1899 he was with Rhodes in Kimberley when it was besieged. He went on to become a commissioner in 1900 (Minister) for public works, but withdrew his support of Sprigg when the latter was opposed to the abolition of the Constitution. Smartt increased pressure for his claims to the premiership of Cape Colony in 1904 on Leander Starr Jameson, but was minister of lands and public works in Jameson's cabinet from 1904 to 1908.
As acting prime minister in 1905 he supported the expansion of the colony for white settlements in Kakamas and set up a select committee for the allocation of vacant Crown land to eligible applicants. From 1908 to 1909 Smartt member of the National Convention, paving the way for the Union in 1910. In 1911 he founded the British Unionist wing, the Official Opposition in Parliament to the South African Party. He followed Jameson as party leader in 1912. Meanwhile, as his first election after unification, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Fort Beaufort. He was removed in 1915 and again in 192. In 1920, he signed a coalition agreement with Gen.Jan Smuts and was minister of agriculture. When Gen. Jan Smuts was defeated in 1924, Smartt became as second in command of the Official Opposition.
He retired from politics before the 1929 election and died on 17 April that same year.

Simona Gherman

Simona Gherman (née Alexandru; born 12 April 1985) is a Romanian épée fencer, European champion in 2012. She was twice team World Champion in 2010 and 2011 and four times team European Champion in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014.
Career.
Gherman was born in Bucharest in 1985. Her first significant result was a team bronze medal with Loredana Iordăchioiu and Ana Maria Brânză at the 2004 Junior World Championships in Plovdiv. The same year, she won a Junior World Cup tournament in Palermo.
Gherman then joined the senior national team captained by Brânză. Along with Iordăchioiu and Anca Măroiu, they won the European Championships in 2008 and 2009. In the 2010 World Fencing Championships, the “ girls”—a nickname the Romanian team had given themselves after the "Powerpuff Girls" anime— took the first Romanian team gold in épée after defeating Germany at the Grand Palais in Paris.
In 2011, Gherman won a team gold at the European Fencing Championships in Sheffield and at the World Military Championships in Rio de Janeiro. In August, she married Dragoș Gherman, whose name she took in competitions. In the World Championships Romania met China in the final. After Brânză was injured, Gherman fenced Li Na in the last leg and scored the decisive hit, allowing Romania to retain their gold medal. She contributed more than half her team's hits. Three World Cup podiums in Budapest, Havana, and Rio de Janeiro, allowed her to reached the 6th place in FIE rankings.
In 2012 Gherman won the gold in the European Championships after prevailing over teammate Măroiu. Along with a podium in the Barcelona World Cup tournament, this result pushed her to the 5th place in FIE rankings, a personal best as of 2014. In the London 2012 Olympics, she was defeated 15–14 in the quarter-finals by Ukraine's Yana Shemyakina, who eventually earned the gold medal. Top-seeded Romania was also defeated 45–38 by 10th-ranked South Korea in the quarter-finals and failed to earn a medal either. Gherman then decided to take a break from her career.
In December 2013 Gherman gave birth to a daughter named Ioana Teodora. She announced in April 2014 she would return to fencing and be reintegrated into the national team. A few weeks later she won the Romanian national championship after defeating 15–12 in the final team mate and world No.1 Ana Maria Brânză. She failed to qualify to the main table of 64 in the Rio de Janeiro World Cup, the first international competition after her comeback, but won a bronze medal a few days later in the Havana Grand Prix. At the European Championships, she reached the semifinal, defeating reigning European champion Ana Brânză and reigning Olympic champion Yana Shemyakina along the way. She lost 9–15 to Marie-Florence Candassamy from hosts France to finish with a bronze medal. In the team competition, No.2 seed Romania received a bye, then disposed of Ukraine 45–31 and met Italy in the semifinals. Gherman both opened and closed for her team, scoring four hits in a row against Rossella Fiamingo in the last relay to win 29–24. In the final against No.1 seed Russia, Gherman entered the last leg on 26 all and defeated Lyubov Shutova 12–8 to bring Romania their 5th gold medal.

<doc id="36584567" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36584567" title="Ulegyria">
Ulegyria

Ulegyria is a diagnosis used to describe a specific type of cortical scarring in the deep regions of the sulcus that leads to distortion of the gyri. Ulegyria is identified by its characteristic "mushroom-shaped" gyri, in which scarring causes shrinkage and atrophy in the deep sulcal regions while the surface gyri are spared. This condition is most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the perinatal period. The effects of ulegyria can range in severity, although it is most commonly associated with cerebral palsy, mental retardation and epilepsy. N.C. Bresler was the first to view ulegyria in 1899 and described this abnormal morphology in the brain as “mushroom-gyri." Although ulegyria was first identified in 1899, there is still limited information known or reported about the condition. 
Anatomy.
The physical features of ulegyria consist of small radial scars which occupy the cortical sulci. Overall, the physical structure of affected areas in the brain is described as a “mushroom”-like shape in which the gyri are unusually large and the sulci become wider deeper in the cortex. N.C. Bresler, the first person to view a brain with ulegyria in 1899, coined the phrase mushroom gyri. He also named the disorder, basing it off the Latin root "ule", meaning scar. This mushroom-like structure is the result of the lower parts of the ulegyria-affected area being more prone to deterioration, while the upper gyri are usually spared. However, the entire affected area shrinks and presents brown coloration as a result of ulegyria. In addition, “islands” of neurons that are relatively unaffected can exist between ulegyria affected neurons. Ulegyria can develop bilaterally or unilaterally, though the former is more commonly diagnosed.
Ulegyria can affect many parts of the brain including the cerebral cortex, parasagittal areas and posterior regions of the brain, such as the parietal and occipital lobes. These areas are situated either near artery rich regions or near a major cerebral artery. For instance, specifically in neonatal children, ulegyria-affected areas are found near the posterior cerebral artery or near the artery rich region between the middle and posterior regions of the brain, often referred to as watershed regions.
Neurons affected by ulegyria exhibit properties that differ from normally functioning neurons. For instance, ulegyria affected neurons experience gliosis in which glial cells, specifically astrocytes, build up near and around neurons. Ulegyria affected neurons also display decreases in their white matter content, showing signs of sclerosis, which is characterized by the deterioration of myelin in neurons. However, in regions of grey matter, large dense aggregates of myelin are present. Ulegyria affected neurons also display metabolic disorders which could be linked to the disease phenylketonuria and disruptions in the urea cycle. Hypoglycemia and hypoxia are also thought to accompany the symptoms of ulegyria-affected neurons as well.
Causes.
Ulegyria develops as a result of a brain injury called cerebral ischemia surrounding the time of an infant’s birth. Oftentimes, fetal hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries occur as a result of a pregnancy complications such as placental abruption, cord accident, or cardiovascular stress due to a difficult delivery. A lack of oxygen to the brain contributes to the formation of lesions usually near the three main cerebral arteries, located near the parietal lobe and occipital lobes of the brain. The cause of perinatal brain injuries includes: 
Some risk factors for perinatal brain injuries include: low birth weight, preterm birth, poor perinatal cardiorespiratory fitness, and artificial ventilation.
Cerebral ischemia.
Cerebral ischemia occurs when the brain is not receiving adequate oxygen to continue normal functions. When this occurs, the body makes restoring oxygenated blood flow to life-sustaining organs a priority. The brain alters the diameter of major blood vessels to redistribute blood to key organs such as the brain, heart, and adrenal glands. If sympathetic nervous system activation does not produce any improvement, oxygen levels will continue to fall and disruptions to metabolism, other cellular processes, and overall functioning will ensue. 
Another serious result of inefficient blood flow is that cells do not receive adequate amounts of glucose. An immediate effect of low intracellular glucose is reduced ATP production in the cell. This effectively inactivates the Na-K pump, leading to the uptake of calcium ions by the cell. Continued influx of calcium serves to constitutively activate downstream effectors, including lipases, proteases, and endonucleases, whose actions eventually destroy the cell skeleton. Intracellular calcium concentrations are increased further due to the opening of glutamate-regulated ion channels. Ischemia causes anoxic cell depolarizations and it is this increase in membrane potential at the presynaptic cell that triggers the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter.
Glucose deprivation in the brain for any amount of time has the potential to pose serious consequences, and the amount of time the brain spends under these anoxic conditions is directly related to accumulation of irreversible damage to protein biosynthesis pathways. Protein synthesis all over the body is severely inhibited and essentially comes to a standstill while the brain is suffering from acute oxygen deprivation. Once oxygen sufficiently saturates the tissues again, protein biosynthesis returns to normal in non-vulnerable areas but remains at below normal levels in other areas. Insufficient protein synthesis in the brain is especially troubling in the fetal brain given the amount of growth and development that normally occurs. Areas particularly vulnerable to the damaging effects of hypoxic episodes include: the superior brainstem, the cerebellum, white matter and subcortical structures supplied by the branches of deep and superficial penetrating blood vessels. Vulnerable areas where protein synthesis is interrupted usually indicate impending cell death in neurons. When oxygen levels return, oxygen radicals, nitric oxide and an imbalance of neurotransmitters cause further damage and lead to cellular death through apoptosis. Neuron cell death is responsible for gliosis and results in the mushroom appearance of areas and is characteristic of ulegyria.
Cerebral hemorrhage.
A cerebral hemorrhage is the result of immature blood vessels of a brain lesion bursting. The germinal matrix is a part of the brain that normally disappears as the fetal brain develops but during this process it is not unusual for changes in vessel volume to cause a vessel to burst. According to recent microscopic studies, the most common location for a cerebral hemorrhage is where the medullary veins drain to the terminal vein in the sub-ependymal region. It has been hypothesized that because pre-term babies don’t have fully developed sympathetic nervous systems, they cannot react as well to low oxygen saturation levels caused by the cerebral hemorrhage. Although babies born at full-term are still susceptible to this, they are likely to respond better and thus, tend to have better outcomes in response to low-oxygen events.
Ascending intrauterine infections.
Recent research has found a connection between intrauterine infections and inflammation in the mother and an increased likelihood of perinatal brain damage in the fetus. This study suggested that intrauterine infections in the mother could affect glial cells and toll-like receptors (TLRs) which are important in moderating the inflammatory response in the fetal brain. When glial cells and TLRs are negatively affected they are not able to react to developing inflammation in the brain as well. The connection between ascending intrauterine infections and perinatal brain damage is a developing research theory but a more detailed explanation of the connection is not yet known.
Signs and symptoms.
Ulegyria was found in about 1/3 of patients with defects caused by circulatory disease in the perinatal period. Most clinical observations of the condition report mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and seizures as the main defects. However, milder cases have been reported in which patients that exhibit ulegyria develop relatively normally. The main movement disorders associated with ulegyria that are classified as cerebral palsy are choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. It is suspected that ulegyria leads to epilepsy because malformation of the cortex obstructs the differentiation of neurons, glial cells, and synapses. Parietal-occipital lobe epilepsy, which is often synonymous with posterior cortex epilepsy (PCE), is the form of the disease seen in most cases involving ulegyria. This type of epilepsy is very rare, making up about 5% of all reports of epilepsy. This form of the disease involves symptoms that would be expected from damage to the parietal and occipital lobes: seizures with visual hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, tingling, numbness, pain, and a burning sensation. In addition to ulegyria, tumors and cortical dysplasia constitute the major causes of PCE. Most of the epilepsy seen in conjunction with ulegyria is classified as medically refractory, meaning it is not responsive to treatment. Patients usually present symptoms of epilepsy at an early age. The severity of epilepsy has been shown to depend on this age of onset as well as the quantity of cortical lesions; earlier onset of epilepsy and a larger extent of lesions tends to mean more severe seizures.
Similar conditions.
Ulegyria is often confused with a similar distortion of the cortex known as polymicrogyria. Polymicrogyria is characterized by excessive folding of the surface gyri and a thickening of the cerebral cortex, rather than the sulcal scarring that is typical of ulegyria. In additional to morphological differences, the period in which polmicrogyria and ulegyria emerge is also different. Polymicrogyria typically forms while the embryo's central nervous system is maturing. Ulegyria is acquired later in development during the perinatal period after neuronal migration has already occurred. It is also suspected that polymicrogyra is genetically linked, whereas ulegyria is caused by environmental factors—namely lack of oxygen.
Polymicrogyria can lead to similar conditions that are linked to ulegyria such as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. It has been observed that patients with polymicrogyria are not receptive to epilepsy surgery. However, responses of patients with ulegyria to similar surgeries are still not fully known, which makes distinction of these two disorders significant. In vivo neuroimaging techniques, namely MRI, have been instrumental in making this distinction. An MRI image of ulegyria is identified by mushroom shaped gyri, deformities in white matter, and localization mainly in the posterior cerebral region. Polymicrogyria is typically recognized by a scalloped appearance at the bordering region between grey and white matter. Although these distinctions have been made with many patients, there is still some difficulty in defining distinct boundaries between these two similar conditions.
Detection.
Primarily, the main method of detecting ulegyria is through the use of MRI screening for epilepsy. Normally an MRI of an ulegyria affected region will reveal groups of deteriorated neurons with gliosis present. In addition, unaffected gyri are also present in especially bilateral watershed regions indicating delayed effects of perinatal hypoxic damage. However there are three main criteria for diagnosing ulegyria using MRI in addition to the features mentioned above:
Another sign of ulegyria that is visible on an MRI scan is the presence of a widened subarachnoid space, signifying cortex atrophy. FLAIR signaling can help visualize the depths of the parietal-occipital sulci, which also allows ulegyria-affected gyri to be identified. Though there is still confusion in differentiating ulegyria and polymicrogyria in patients, MRI allows for the proper identification in the majority of the cases. In addition, most of the current research regarding ulegyria is focused on improving this identification. Furthermore, MRI can diagnose whether ulegyria presence is unilateral or bilateral. Electroencephalography, EEG, can also be used to screen for ulegyria, though MRI is still preferred. This is mainly done for epilepsy patients as abnormalities in EEG recordings indicate the presence of ulegyria in the area of the brain being tested. For example, when EEG tests in epileptic patients show deviations in the frontal and central-parietal regions, ulegyria can be considered to be present in that area.
Treatment.
Presently, there is no well-defined treatment for ulegyria mainly because of the irreversible ischaemic damage done to neurons of an affected area. However, conditions associated with ulegyria, such as epilepsy and cerebral palsy, can be treated using the appropriate treatment. For instance, seizures caused by epilepsy, due to the presence of ulegyria in the occipital lobe, can be controlled using antiepileptic drugs in some patients. In other patients, such as those who suffer from ulegyria in the posterior cortex, drugs are not effective and surgery of the area causing epilepsy is needed. These treatments treat only the conditions but have no effect on the condition of ulegyria itself.

Gangnam Style

"Gangnam Style" (, ) is the 18th K-pop single by the South Korean musician Psy. The song was released in July 2012 as the lead single of his sixth studio album "Psy 6 (Six Rules), Part 1", and debuted at number one on South Korea's Gaon Chart. On December 21, 2012, "Gangnam Style" became the first YouTube video to reach a billion views. , the music video has been viewed over two billion times on YouTube, and it is the site's most watched video after surpassing Justin Bieber's single "Baby".
The phrase "Gangnam Style" is a Korean neologism that refers to a lifestyle associated with the Gangnam District of Seoul. The song and its accompanying music video went viral in August 2012 and have influenced popular culture worldwide since then. "Gangnam Style" received mixed reviews, with praise going to its catchy beat and Psy's amusing dance moves (which themselves have become a phenomenon) in the music video and during live performances in various locations around the world. In September 2012, "Gangnam Style" was recognized by "Guinness World Records" as the most "liked" video on YouTube. It subsequently won Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards held later that year. It became a source of parodies and reaction videos by many different individuals, groups and organizations.
By the end of 2012, the song had topped the music charts of more than 30 countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. As the song continued to rapidly gain popularity and ubiquity, its signature dance moves were attempted by many notable political leaders such as the British Prime Minister David Cameron, U.S. President Barack Obama, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who hailed it as a "force for world peace". On May 7, 2013, at a bilateral meeting with South Korea's President Park Geun-hye at the White House, U.S. President Barack Obama cited the success of "Gangnam Style" as an example of how people around the world are being "swept up" by the Korean Wave of culture.
Background and release.
"Gangnam Style" is a Korean neologism that refers to a lifestyle associated with the Gangnam District of Seoul, where people are trendy, hip and exude a certain supposed "class". The term was listed in "Time"'s weekly vocabulary list as "a manner associated with lavish lifestyles in Seoul's Gangnam district." Psy likened the Gangnam District to Beverly Hills, California, and said in an interview that he intended in a twisted sense of humour by claiming himself to be "Gangnam Style" when everything about the song, dance, looks, and the music video is far from being such a high class.
The song talks about "the perfect girlfriend who knows when to be refined and when to get wild". The song's refrain "오빤 강남 스타일 (Oppan Gangnam style)" has been translated as "Big brother is Gangnam style", with Psy referring to himself. During an interview with "The New York Times", Psy revealed that the Korean fans have huge expectations about his dancing, so he felt a lot of pressure. In order to keep up with expectations, he studied hard to find something new and stayed up late for about 30 nights to come up with the "Gangnam Style" dance. Along the way, he had tested various "cheesy" animal-inspired dance moves with his choreographer, including panda and kangaroo moves, before settling for the horse trot, which involves pretending to ride a horse, alternately holding the reins and spinning a lasso, and moving into a legs-shuffling side gallop.
During an interview with Reuters, Psy claimed that "Gangnam Style" was originally produced only for local K-pop fans. On July 11, Psy and his music label YG Entertainment started releasing several promotional teasers for "Gangnam Style" to their subscribers on YouTube. On July 15, 2012, the full music video of "Gangnam Style" was uploaded onto YouTube and was immediately a sensation, receiving about 500,000 views on its first day. However, in Germany, an ongoing dispute between YouTube and the GEMA (the country's performance rights organization) regarding copyright issues has led to thousands of music videos including "Gangnam Style" being blocked in the country.
K-pop and the Korean Wave.
According to the news agency Agence France-Presse, the success of "Gangnam Style" could be considered as part of the Korean Wave, a term coined by Chinese journalists to refer to the significant increase in the popularity of South Korean entertainment and culture since the late 1990s.
Korean popular music (K-pop), considered by some to be the most important aspect of the Korean Wave, is a music genre that relies on cultural technology to adapt to the tastes of foreign audiences and has now grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults in many places around the world. Although it has spread to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, its reception in the Western world has so far been lukewarm. However, social media networks such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easier for K-pop musicians to reach a wider audience in the West. According to Mark James Russell from "Foreign Policy", while the Korean Wave "may not (yet) turn heads in Los Angeles or London", this could soon change because of "Gangnam Style".
Reception.
Critical reception.
The song has received mixed to positive ratings from music critics. Music journalist Bill Lamb from "About.com" praised the song for "spreading smiles and pure fun around the world in record time." He then writes, "take one part LMFAO's synth-based party music, another part Ricky Martin's Latin dance party and the rest a powerfully charismatic South Korean showman and you have the first worldwide K-Pop smash hit," while Ian Garland of the "Daily Mail" called "Gangnam Style" a "bizarre music sensation."
Jeff Benjamin from "Billboard" became one of the first music critics to review the song when he published an article and reported that "Gangnam Style" has gone viral on the Internet. In his article, Benjamin introduced the reader to a couple of popular K-pop songs and wrote that "Gangnam Style" in particular, plays all the right moves sonically while "borrowing from LMFAO along the way".
The next day, Hallie Sekoff of "The Huffington Post" quoted from the video's official YouTube video description that the song is characterized by its "strongly addictive beats", and wrote that this is not too far-fetched, considering "how obsessed we've found ourselves." London's mayor Boris Johnson considered the song to be the greatest cultural masterpiece of 2012.
Despite its popularity, a few music critics including Robert Copsey from Digital Spy criticized the song for being monotonous. Cospey wrote that "you could slap an LMFAO tag on the cover and few would know the difference" and Paul Lester of "The Guardian" similarly labelled it as "generic ravey Euro dance with guitars". Lester described the song as "Pump Up the Jam meets the Macarena with a dash of Cotton Eye Joe" while Robert Myers of "The Village Voice" dismissed "Gangnam Style" as an "inspired piece of silliness".
South Korea and Japan.
Cha Woo-jin, a South Korean music critic, told "The Chosun Ilbo" that "Gangnam Style"'s sophisticated rendering and arrangement has made it very appealing to the general public. Choe Kwang-shik, the South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, told reporters that "Gangnam Style" had played an important role in introducing the Korean culture, language, and lifestyle to the rest of the world. However, some have criticized the song for failing to accurately represent South Korean culture. Oh Young-Jin, managing editor of "The Korea Times", wrote that the dance has more to do with Americans than Koreans.
In Japan, the song has met with considerable criticism. When "Gangnam Style" first appeared in Japanese TV shows in July, the reaction from viewers was negative. As a result, Psy's Japanese record label YGEX cancelled a previously planned Japanese language re-release of "Gangnam Style". According to "The Dong-a Ilbo", a South Korean newspaper, the song's lukewarm reception in Japan could have been caused by a diplomatic conflict between the two countries and the newspaper accused the Japanese media of keeping its people "in the dark". However, Jun Takaku of the Japanese daily newspaper "Asahi Shimbun" explained that "Gangnam Style" had caused "barely a ripple in Japan" because Psy does not conform to the image of other "traditionally polished" K-pop acts popular in Japan such as Girls' Generation and TVXQ. Erica Ho from "Time" magazine similarly noted that despite the K-pop musical genre being very popular in Japan, the country seemed to be "immune to PSY Mania" and she advised her readers who dislike the song to "pack your bags for Japan".
Immediately after its release, "Gangnam Style" was mentioned by various English-language websites providing coverage of Korean pop culture for international fans, including Allkpop and Soompi. Simon and Martina Stawski, a Canadian couple living in Seoul who were among the first to parody "Gangnam Style" in late July, wrote that the song has the potential to become "one of the biggest songs of the year". However, during an interview with Al Jazeera a few weeks later, Martina Stawski claimed that the worldwide popularity of "Gangnam Style" has been viewed negatively by some K-pop fans, because "they fans didn't want K-pop being liked by other people who don't understand K-Pop". This view is also supported by the British journalist and K-pop fan Promi Ferdousi, who wrote that the song has managed to "find its way into our clubs" while the best K-pop songs are limited to niche groups on social media websites.
Music video.
Synopsis.
The video starts out with Psy, who is lounging at what looks like a sandy beach, under a sun umbrella and holding a cold drink, but the camera zooms out to reveal he is actually at a playground. The video then alternates between the playground, where a boy (Hwang Min-woo) dances next to him; and a row of horses in stalls, where Psy performs his signature "invisible horse dance". As Psy (and two girls) walk through a parking garage, they are pelted by pieces of newspaper, trash, and snow. At a sauna, he rests his head on a man's shoulder, dressed in blue, while another man covered in tattoos is stretching. He then sings in front of two men playing Janggi (Korean chess), dances with a woman at a tennis court, and bounces around on a tour bus of seniors. The scenes alternate quickly until there is an explosion near the chess players, causing them to dive off the bench. Psy immediately walks towards the camera, pointing and shouting "Oppan Gangnam Style". The chorus starts as he and some dancers perform at a horse stable. He dances as two women walk backwards. He dances at the tennis court, a carousel, and the tour bus. He shuffles into an outdoor yoga session and on a boat. The camera zooms in on a woman's butt, then shows Psy "yelling" at it.
The chorus ends and he is seen at a parking lot, where Psy is approached by a man (Yoo Jae-suk) in a yellow suit who steps out of a red Mercedes-Benz SLK 200; they have a dance duel. He then appears in an elevator underneath a man (Noh Hong-Chul) who is straddling him and thrusting his pelvis. The man in the yellow suit then gets in his car and leaves. The camera pans and it shows Psy in the subway station, where he boards the train and notices an attractive young woman (Hyuna) dancing. At one of the train stops, he approaches the girl in slow motion, and she does the same. They start to embrace. He then tells the girl "Oppan Gangnam Style", and they horse dance along with some others at the train stop, commencing the second chorus. He also surfaces from a spa.
Psy sings to the girl at a night club as people in various costumes walk behind them. He raps in a serious tone in an enclosed space, but when he says "You know what I'm saying" the camera zooms out, and it is revealed that he is actually sitting on a toilet with his pants down. Psy and a large group of dancers do the horse dance and strike a final pose. After a brief reprise of the dance duel, Psy says, "Oppan Gangnam style", and the video finishes with a cartoon graphic.
Production.
The music video is directed by Cho Soo-hyun, who also directed the MV for Psy's follow-up single "Gentleman" and the MV for "This Love" by Shinhwa. It shows Psy performing a comical horse-riding dance and appearing in unexpected locations around the Gangnam District, such as an outdoor yoga session and a hot tub. He wears several distinctive suits and black sunglasses with a mindset of "dress classy and dance cheesy". It features a "skewering the Gangnam image" by the "non-Gangnam Psy"; this parody would be recognizable to viewers familiar with Korean culture. Although there are more than ten different locations featured, only two of the scenes are actually filmed in the Gangnam district. The sauna scene, elevator scene and bathroom scene were filmed elsewhere in the greater Seoul region, and some shots were filmed in World Trade Center Seoul and the Songdo International Business District, which includes Songdo Central Park and International Business District Station. The video was shot over 48 hours in July 2012.
In K-pop, it is routine to have cameos by celebrities in a music video, such as in the dance scenes in the elevator and the parking garage. The guests in the music video include:
The music was composed by Psy and Yoo Gun-hyung, a producer in South Korea who has also collaborated with Psy in the past. Yoo also arranged the song while Psy was responsible for the lyrics.
Viral spread.
Following its July 15 release, "Gangnam Style" overtook Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe" to reach the number one position on the YouTube Top 100 Music Videos during the week of August 28, 2012. On September 1, it overtook Girls' Generation's "Gee" to become the most viewed K-pop video on YouTube. Although "Call Me Maybe" has had unusually strong staying power, averaging over 1.5 million views each day, "Gangnam Style" increased to an average of over nine million views per day within just two months. This is mainly because "Call Me Maybe" remained largely a North American trend, whereas the popularity of "Gangnam Style" is not confined to the United States. 61.6 percent of viewers were male, and those aged between 13 and 17 represented the biggest group.
According to "The Wall Street Journal", T-Pain was among the first to have "sent video to the stratosphere" when he tweeted about it on July 29. It was then picked up by Neetzan Zimmerman from the social blog Gawker, who asked "Did this underground Hip Hop artist from South Korea just release the Best Music Video of the Year?" on July 30. This was soon followed by Robbie Williams, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Tom Cruise, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and William Gibson, who have either commented about or shared the video with their fans via Twitter.
The earliest video to catch the attention of media networks outside South Korea was "Psy Gangnam Style MV Reaction", which was uploaded by Katie and Mindy Anderson on July 18, 2012. The Andersons were subsequently interviewed by Evan Ramstad from "The Wall Street Journal" a few weeks later. In his article published on August 6, 2012, Ramstad also included "Kpop Music Mondays : PSY Gangnam Style", a review and parody of "Gangnam Style" uploaded on July 23 by K-pop video bloggers Simon and Martina Stawski, a Canadian couple living in Seoul. This makes the Stawski's video the earliest parody featured in an American newspaper. On August 8, 2012, Ramstad appeared on "WSJ Live", and he mentioned the Andersons and the Stawskis again, before claiming that "a lot of Koreans are also making their own parodies of 'Gangnam Style'".
On September 3, 2012, the number of daily views generated by "Gangnam Style" went past the five-million mark. By the end of September, it had topped the iTunes charts in 31 countries.
"Gangnam Style" reached the unprecedented milestone of one billion YouTube views on December 21, 2012. A spoof documentary by videographer Simon Gosselin was posted on YouTube and had promoted 2012 doomsday rumors across social media services such as Facebook and Twitter that linked "Gangnam Style" to a fake Nostradamus prophecy. On December 21, at around 15:50 UTC, the video's YouTube page updated with 1,000,382,639 views. YouTube specially marked the video's accomplishments with a cartoon dancing Psy animated icon, added first by the site logo, and later next to the video's view counter when it exceeded a billion views. On April 6, 2013 the video on YouTube reached 1.5 billion views. On June 1, 2014, the music video reached two billion views.
Review.
The music video of "Gangnam Style" has been met with positive responses from the music industry and commentators, who drew attention to its tone and dance moves, though some found them vulgar. Another notable aspect that helped popularise the video was its comical dance moves that can be easily copied, such as the pelvic thrust during the elevator scene. The United Nations hailed Psy as an "international sensation" because of the popularity of his "satirical" video clip and its "horse-riding-like dance moves". As such, the music video spawned a dance craze unseen since the Macarena of the mid-1990s.
The World Bank's lead economist David McKenzie remarked that some of Psy’s dance moves "kind of look like a regression discontinuity", while the space agency NASA called "Gangnam Style" a dance-filled music video that has forever entered the hearts and minds of millions of people. Melissa Locker of "Time" noted that "it's hard not to watch again ...and again ...and again", while CNN reporter Shanon Cook told the audience that she had watched "Gangnam Style" about 15 times.
The German news magazine "Der Spiegel" attributed the popularity of "Gangnam Style" to its daring dance moves, a sentiment similarly voiced by Maura Judkis of "The Washington Post", who wrote, "'Gangnam Style' has made an extraordinarily stupid-looking dance move suddenly cool". The video was also positively reviewed by Steve Knopper from "Rolling Stone", who called "Gangnam Style" an astoundingly great K-pop video that has all the best elements of hypnotically weird one-hit wonders and hopes that "PSY gets filthy rich from this".
Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press wrote that Psy's dance moves are "somewhat bizarre" but the music video is full of colorful, lively outfits. Matt Buchanan and Scott Ellis of "The Sydney Morning Herald" wrote that the video "makes no sense at all to most Western eyes" and it "makes you wonder if you have accidentally taken someone else's medication" whereas Deborah Netburn of the "Los Angeles Times" called it "one of the greatest videos ever to be uploaded to YouTube." Kim Alessi from Common Sense Media considered the music video for "Gangnam Style" worth seeing for its caricature of contemporary Asian and American urban lifestyles, but also warned that "Gangnam Style" contains sexually suggestive images and "degrading messages" which could be inappropriate for children and teenagers.

On September 14, he appeared on NBC's morning program "Today" in New York City for its Toyota Concert Series, where he performed the song and also taught the anchors the dance.

Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" commented that "Psy's feverish rendition of 'Gangnam Style' accomplished what so few award show performances can: a palpable sense of excitement. The combination of the K-pop star and MC Hammer...was a stroke of genius that very few could have seen coming", choosing it as the best performance of the night. "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" did a special Thanksgiving broadcast with an all-military audience on November 22, and Psy dropped by as the musical guest. The singer sang the song and danced alongside the soldiers, going into the crowd for part of his performance.

The phrase "Oppan Gangnam Style" was entered into "The Yale Book of Quotations" as one of the most famous quotes of 2012.
Social.
As the song's popularity continued to rise, it caused the share price of the song's music label YG Entertainment to gain as much as 50% on the Korea Exchange. DI Corporation, whose executive Chairman Park Won-Ho is Psy's father, saw its share price increase by 568.8% within a few months of the song's release despite making a year-over-year loss. Soon, "Gangnam Style" began to attract the attention of several business and political leaders, including UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon who recognized the song as a "force for world peace". During his meeting with Psy at the United Nations Headquarters, he commented, "We have tough negotiations in the United Nations. In such a case I was also thinking of playing Gangnam Style-dance so that everybody would stop and dance. Maybe you can bring UN style."
Through social networks like Facebook, many small, unofficial fan-organized flash mobs have been held in universities and colleges throughout the world. The earliest flash mobs were held in Pasadena, California, and Sydney, Australia. On September 12, Times Square in Manhattan was filled with a dance mob dancing to the music of "Gangnam Style" during ABC's "Good Morning America".

In Thailand, officials from the Dan Sai municipality in Loei Province shot a video of people wearing masks and performing "Gangnam Style" during the Phi Ta Khon "ghost" festival. According to the Thai newspaper "The Nation", villagers and spiritual leaders from Loei province have felt "uneasy" and also "greatly offended" about this "Gangnam Style" performance which tarnishes the image of a 400 year-old tradition. Another controversial incident was sparked by a "Gangnam Style" parody by officers from the Royal Thai Navy, which was not well received by some high-ranking commanders. Although Vice Admiral Tharathorn Kajitsuwan from the "Third Naval Area Command" insisted that "we had no intention to insult or make fun of navy officers in uniform", some senior officers have called it "improper". Kajitsuwan claimed that his subordinates had the right to upload the video to YouTube, although he did not expect them to do so. On October 1, 2012, he issued an apology to his colleagues. Commander Surasak Rounroengrom believes an investigation is unnecessary because the video caused no damage to the Navy, but he admits that there was some impropriety about military officers doing their "fancy stepping in uniform".
Popular culture.
Since September 2012, the dance has been performed by athletes in international competitions. These people include Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao, Uruguayan footballer Edinson Cavani, Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic, and Jamaican cricketer Chris Gayle, who danced "Gangnam Style" twice during the West Indies' match against Ireland and then repeated the act during the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 match against England.

The dance was also shown on the Argentine TV series "Graduados", performed by the Argentine-Korean actor Chang Kim Sung. In Fall 2012, a cover version of the song was performed on the Fox TV show "Glee" in the episode "Thanksgiving".
In mid-September, the Brazilian singer Latino released the song "Despedida de solteiro" (The Bachelor's Party), which is supposed to be a cover of "Gangnam Style". Many felt offended by his disrespectful lyrics, and some have called it a plagiarized copy of "Gangnam Style". While Psy's original lyrics talk about the lifestyle of the Gangnam people, Latino's version is about a man that is enjoying his bachelor's party in a club, wanting (and having) sex with many women, so drunk that he says he does not know if he's really going to get married the next day. Latino had stated that it was an authorized version.
Political and environmental activism.
On September 18, 2012, the North Korean government became the first to use "Gangnam Style" for political activism when it uploaded a parody with the title ""I'm Yushin style!"" onto the government website Uriminzokkiri. The parody mocks the South Korean ruling conservative party presidential-elect Park Geun-hye. It shows a Photoshopped image of the presidential candidate performing the dance moves of "Gangnam Style" and labels her as a devoted admirer of the Yushin system of autocratic rule set up by her father, Park Chung-hee. A few weeks later, ""草泥马 style"" (literally, "Grass Mud Horse Style"), was uploaded onto YouTube and other Chinese websites by the political activist and dissident Ai Weiwei. In his parody, Ai Weiwei dances "Gangnam Style" with a pair of handcuffs as a symbol of his arrest by Chinese authorities in 2011. According to the Associated Press, government authorities had removed the video from almost all Chinese websites the next day.
South Korean President Park Geun-hye took office on February 25, 2013. At her inauguration Psy performed "Gangnam Style" and "Champion", one of his first hits in his native country.
In order to show his solidarity with Ai Weiwei and to advocate the freedom of expression, the British sculptor Anish Kapoor produced the video "Gangnam for Freedom", which features other prominent British artists as well as human rights activists from various international organisations including Index on Censorship and Amnesty International. A few days before, the global grassroots network Students for a Free Tibet had uploaded a parody of "Gangnam Style" to show its support for the Tibetan independence movement. According to Max Fisher from "The Washington Post", this parody of "Gangnam Style" was likely to be filmed in Dharamshala, the home of Tibet's government-in-exile in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.

Janine Tugonon, 2012 Miss Universe 1st runner-up, joined and danced on one of their campaign at Pandacan, Manila. According to the Department's Assistant Secretary, Dr. Eric Tayag, the popularity of the song will attract people especially children to use safer means of celebration such as dancing "Gangnam Style". In contrast, the Philippine National Police was confirming intelligence reports about a firecracker named "Gangnam bomb", which supposedly produced by illegal firecracker makers in Bocaue, Bulacan and apparently riding on the popularity of the song. According to Chief Superintendent Raul Petrasanta, director of the Firearms and Explosives Office of the Philippine National Police, he did not know what the possibly dangerous "Gangnam bomb" looks like.
Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a close associate of Osama bin Laden currently held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, had also used the song to demonstrate his ability to gain access to popular cultural trends despite being confined within a top secret prison.

One such parody includes "Conjugation Style", a parody used to teach students about the conjugation of "-er" verbs in the French language.
Legacy.
The success of "Gangnam Style" is a result of the build-up of South Korea's music industry that has been in the works for over 20 years, and it has led to other K-pop artists positioning themselves for a similar breakthrough in the U.S. music industry. Frances Moore, chief executive of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, brought up Gangnam Style as an example of how South Korea became one of the "most successful exporters of repertoire".
Increased interest in the Korean Wave.
According to the news agency Agence France-Presse, the success of "Gangnam Style" has led to the further rise and spread of the Korean Wave to other countries. As the song continued to attract worldwide media attention, it also led to various broadcasting networks and national newspapers focusing its attention on K-pop and other aspects of Korean culture. For example, "The Daily Telegraph" published an article recommending its readers to try out everything from K-Pop to "K-Cars", "K-Phones" and "K-Cuisine". The British multinational grocery and retailer Tesco reported that its total sales of Korean food had more than doubled as a result of the popularity of "Gangnam Style". Kim Byoung-gi, the Korean Ambassador to Lebanon, wrote that "Gangnam Style" has helped bridge Lebanese and Korean cultures. The French-born political commentator Tim Soutphommasane, a Research fellow at Monash University, agrees that the Gangnam phenomenon is "something worth studying". According to Soutphommasane, the world is only beginning to appreciate Gangnam Style as "part of a broader "hallyu cultural wave" coming out of the country Korea".
South Korea.
In 2012, the South Korean government announced that "Gangnam Style" had brought in $13.4 million to the country’s audio sector, and it subsequently launched a campaign to further expand the K-Pop music industry overseas. According to the Bank of Korea, the country's services account recorded a surplus of USD 2.3 billion in the first nine months of this year, compared to a deficit of USD 4.5 billion last year. This was mainly due to the growing influence and popularity of K-pop songs such as "Gangnam Style". However, the American journalist John Seabrook noted that by "satirizing standard K-pop tropes in Gangnam Style", Psy may have subverted the music genre's chances of making it big in the West.
Music industry.
Record executives in the music industry believe that music charts will increasingly be filled with YouTube-driven globalised acts from foreign countries. Sean Carey, a research fellow in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Roehampton, wrote that the flow of popular music will no longer be a single traffic route from North America and Europe to other parts of the globe, but will also move the other way as well. According to Adam Sherwin from "The Independent", the global web demand for Gangnam Style had short-circuited the "traditional reluctance" of radio stations to play foreign-language songs. The song is also underlining a shift in how money is being made in the music business. Although Psy earned more than US$60,000 from music sales of "Gangnam Style" in South Korea alone, he and his music label YG Entertainment have raked in almost US$1 million from advertisements which appear on YouTube videos identified for using "Gangnam Style" in its content. The "Harvard Business Review" published an article written by Kevin Evers, who explained how "Gangnam Style" had changed Billboard's ranking methodology of its music charts. Instead of relying solely on radio plays and paid purchases, Billboard started to place a heavier emphasis on digital sales and YouTube views. As a result of the change, Gangnam Style moved up to the top position of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs music chart. According to the British Phonographic Industry's report based on Official Charts Company sales data, thanks to Psy's song and Carly Rae Jepsen’s "Call Me Maybe," pop became the UK’s favourite musical genre of the year, taking the lion’s share of the singles market (38.5%) in 2012.

Guttman Community College

Stella and Charles Guttman Community College is the newest of City University of New York's seven community colleges. Located at 50 West 40th Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, it was founded on September 11, 2011 and opened on August 20, 2012 as New Community College. In April 2013 the college was renamed following a $15 million endowment from the Stella and Charles Guttman Foundation.
Guttman offers 2-year associate degree programs with majors in Business Administration, Human Services, Information Technology, Liberal Arts and Sciences, and Urban Studies. Students are accepted with either a high school diploma or Certificate of High School Equivalency.
History.
Guttman was the first new community college established by City University of New York (CUNY) in over 40 years. The planning was begun in 2008 on the initiative of CUNY's Chancellor, Matthew Goldstein. The planning phase was supported by CUNY funds, an initial allocation $8.9 million from the City of New York's annual budget, and donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Michael Bloomberg's Center for Economic Opportunity. Described by the "New York Times" as "a multimillion-dollar experiment in how to fix what ails community colleges," Guttman College's academic structure and curriculum were designed from scratch in an effort to improve students' chances of completing their associate degrees and transferring to four-year colleges for further study.
In 2010, the first faculty were appointed and Scott E. Evenbeck, professor of psychology and dean of University College at Indiana University-Purdue University, was named the founding President, taking up his post in January 2011. The college was officially established on September 11, 2011 and opened with its first intake of students in August 2012. The college had, and continues to have, an open admissions policy, provided students have a high school diploma or a Certificate of High School Equivalency. However, unlike any of the other schools within CUNY, applicants are not considered until they have attended a lengthy information session and one-on-one interviews with counselors. Of its initial 4,000 applicants, 504 went through the information session and interviews. Of those, approximately 300 decided to enroll in the founding class.
The college opened under the name "New Community College." In April 2013 following the gift of a $15 million endowment from the Stella and Charles Guttman Foundation, one of the largest ever donations to a public two-year college, the CUNY Board of Trustees passed a resolution renaming the college "Stella and Charles Guttman Community College."

<doc id="36584780" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36584780" title="Uruguayan constitutional referendum, 1980">
Uruguayan constitutional referendum, 1980

A constitutional referendum was held in Uruguay on 30 November 1980. Although the new constitution drafted by the military regime was rejected by voters, some of its proposals were implemented anyway.
Background.
A military coup in 1973 had led to a civic-military dictatorship. In 1976 the military government issued a series of constitutional decrees that amended the 1967 constitution by creating the Council of the Nation (Consejo de la Nación) to serve as the supreme governmental body, with executive and legislative functions. It consisted of the 30 members of the Council of State (a body created by the regime in June 1973 to act in lieu of the General Assembly, which was dissolved by the regime and the 28 senior officers of the armed forces (sixteen from the army, six from the navy, and six from the air force). The Council of the Nation appointed the President and the members of the Council of State, the Supreme Court of Justice, and the Tribunal of Administrative Claims. Eight institutional acts substituted for many of the functional provisions and guarantees of the 1967 constitution. The Council of the Nation was given the power to appoint the President and to set general policy for the country. In addition, institutional acts deprived previous officeholders and candidates of their political rights and permitted the arbitrary dismissal of public employees.
Under the 1976 constitutional amendments, the President exercised executive power, acting with the concurrence of one or more ministers as appropriate or with the National Security Council (Consejo de Seguridad Nacional, COSENA). The COSENA was formed in 1973 and consisted of the commanders of the army, navy, and air force, with an additional senior military officer, and the ministers of national defense, interior, and foreign affairs. It participated in any decision related to the "national security" or in any formulation of overall plans or objectives.
The constitutional decrees declared generally that the maintenance of the national security was of "exclusive competence," or the sole prerogative, of the armed forces, and also deprived local governments of all budgetary powers. The Council of State continued to pass laws that the executive normally would have submitted for approval. Only the executive could initiate the procedure for approval of legislation on budgetary or other matters that could be related in any way to national security. The decrees also created the Ministry of Justice, responsible for relations between the executive and judicial powers.
New constitution.
In 1980 the military regime drew up a charter that would have provided for a strong, continuing role for the military along the lines of the 1976 constitutional decrees, including legitimising the COSENA's new role. The document also would have greatly reduced the roles of the General Assembly and political parties.
Aftermath.
Despite the rejection by voters, a new 35 member Council of State was installed on 20 August 1981, before President Gregorio Conrado Álvarez took office. Its powers were expanded to include responsibility for calling a constitutional assembly, referendums, and general elections.

Green Party of England and Wales leadership election, 2010

The Green Party of England and Wales leadership election, 2010 took place in August and September 2010. The party has elections every two years for leader and deputy leader roles and this was the second election since the party decided to switch from having principle speakers to having a leader and a deputy leader, or co-leaders. Caroline Lucas was re-elected as leader unopposed and Adrian Ramsay was re-elected as deputy leader after defeating former principle speaker Derek Wall.
All members of the party were sent ballot papers in the post with their copy of the party's magazine, "Green World" and voting ended shortly after hustings were held at the party's autumn conference in Birmingham where members who had not already posted their ballot papers could vote in person at conference.
Campaign.
Caroline Lucas and Adrian Ramsay campaigned for re-election together and shared materials such as a website and leaflets promoting them both together. This was possibly due to Ramsey having limited time due to fighting an all-out by-election on Norwich City Council (where he was a councillor) who had called for an election for all council seats due to failing to become a unitary authority with polling day the day before the Green Party conference.
Derek Wall campaigned with the support of internal group Green Left which he has been an active member of since its formation.
Results.
A total of 3,279 votes were cast in the postal ballot.
The results were as follows:
For leader
For deputy leadership

<doc id="36584833" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36584833" title="Canterbury election of 1205">
Canterbury election of 1205

The Canterbury election of 1205 was a contested election to the Archbishopric of Canterbury that led to the long quarrel between King John of England and Pope Innocent III.
Background.
King John's attempt to force de Gray's election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 was the beginning of the king's long quarrel with Pope Innocent III. Traditionally English kings had broad powers over the English Church, and this had survived the Becket controversy during John's father's reign. John, however, reigned concurrently with Innocent III, who was one of the foremost exponents of the concept of papal monarchy.
After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. King John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the cathedral chapter went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to canon law the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major tenant-in-chief and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisors.
While the delegations from the various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury secretly elected one of their own, Reginald, as archbishop, and subsequently sent him to Rome to join the delegation. When King John discovered that Reginald had been elected without any royal input he forced the monks to elect de Gray as archbishop. Some stories have Reginald's election taking place before the despatch of the first delegation to the papal curia. Another source, Gervase of Canterbury, has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure de Gray's election. A further story, from Roger of Wendover, states that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried, and that only a few members of the cathedral chapter – the younger ones – participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and was not a monk of Canterbury, therefore it is unlikely he has recorded a true account.
De Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which presented Innocent with two candidates for the office. In an effort to reach a compromise, the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206; Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy. The monks then elected Stephen Langton, with Innocent's approval. John did not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. Innocent placed an interdict on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to excommunicate John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester, were the only English bishops not in exile or dead. But it was not until 1213, when Innocent began to support John's deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.

The Evangelical College of Theology

The Evangelical College of Theology (TECT) is a Christian educational establishment in Sierra Leone, whose mission is to "Preach the Word, Reach the World." The college offers certificate, diplomas, and bachelor degree programs. Enrolment for the 2011-12 school year was 259 students. The college operates at four locations: the main campus in Jui, the Freetown Extension site, and the Makeni and Bo Distance Education sites.
TECT is partnered with the Global Connection Partnership Network, Overseas Council International, and the European Baptist Mission. These organizations provide short term and long term supportive staff to the college. For the 2012-13 school year, the campus has 37 Sierra Leonean staff and faculty members, with 4 American staff and faculty members in lecturer or administrative support roles.
History.
In 1957, an Inter-Missions Bible School Committee was formed by four Christian denominations in Sierra Leone: The Missionary Church of Africa (MCA), United Brethren in Christ (UBC), and the American Wesleyan Methodist Church (AWM) now called the Wesleyan Church of Sierra Leone. This committee formed from the identified need for training pastors and administrators for the Christian churches of Sierra Leone.
During the transition from colonial rule which was finalized in 1961, the committee requested from British government to obtain land for a campus. The British government granted the land and buildings of a former military barracks located on the Jui Peninsula 10 miles east of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital city.
On October 12, 1964, the Sierra Leone Bible College was founded and begun offering both diploma and bachelor’s level degrees.
The campus was initially led and run by western missionaries, predominantly from the United States. The missionaries, and their sending denominations, provided funding for all the operations of the campus.
During this time, the enrolment year to year varied between ten and thirty students.
In 1979, the Baptist Convention of Sierra Leone was added as a proprietary body.
In 1998, the Countess of Huntington Connexion was added as a proprietary body and the Missionary Church of Africa (MCA) withdrew its proprietorship.
In 1999, the campus officially changed its name to The Evangelical College of Theology (TECT).
During the Civil War.
When the civil war escalated in the 1990s, the western missionary leadership of the college gathered several alumni who were then in positions of church leadership in Sierra Leone. The missionaries informed the Sierra Leoneans that they were withdrawing both their personnel and financial support of the campus and handed full leadership to the Sierra Leoneans.
This presented a challenge to the new national leadership. Enrolment and tuition of ten to thirty students each year did not financially provide for the needs and upkeep of the campus. As a result, additional programs were initiated and the enrolment was grown from thirty to over 200 students each semester at the main campus in Jui outside of Freetown.
Current Programs.
TECT now offers diplomas and degrees in the following areas:

The Poor Bride

The Poor Bride (Бедная невеста, Bednaya nevesta) is a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, written in 1851 and first published in the #4, 1852 issue of "Moskvityanin" magazine. It was his first play to be staged at the Maly Theater, where it was premiered on October 12, 1853.
Background.
His second large play cost Ostrovsky many a sleepless night. Later he wrote: "I've had an iron-like creative prowess when I was learning how to write, but still, after having worked for a year and a half on "The Poor Bride" (my 2nd one) I came to detest it so much I didn't want to see it on stage. I agreed to stage it only answering the continuous actors' request and only after two years after it's been finished". The author has changed the plot three times. The play's central figure, Marya Andreevna caused the author most of the trouble for showing the suffering young woman’s soul; was something novel to him.
The target of Ostrovsky's satire was the Petersburg's pretentious romantic poseurs. Merich (Zorich in the rough version) was "a parody on Lermontov's heroes, Grushnitsky, trying to act Pechorin," according to scholar Vladimir Lakshin. His name came from Lermontov's Meri (with typical Lermontov's surname ending, like in Vulich, Zvezdich or Kazbich). In one of the play's versions Marya Andreevna was holding Lermontov's book in hand. "The charisma of a disappointed romantic hero which became a cliché in the Russian literature of the 1840s demanded a literary backlash", Lakshin wrote.
Meanwhile, another biographer, S.V.Maksimov, insisted the play's characters were not schemes but portraits of people who surrounded the author. The Nezabudkin family had similarities with the Korsh family (three brothers and five sister were all known in the artistic circles one way or another), Benevolensky was looking a bit like professor Krylov, one of the Korsh sisters' husband and the main reason for Ostrovsky's leaving the university. It was Krylov who, known for penchant for taking bribes, drunken scandals and rudeness, served as a prototype for Benevolensky. The unhappy romance of Khorkov and Marya Andreevna reminded the similar relations between one of the Korsh sisters, Antonina, and Apollon Grigoryev, according to Lakshin. But according to V.A.Grigoriev (Apollon's grandson), in Marya Andreevna' character the author depicted Zinaida Korsh, the sister he himself was romantically involved with. Singer, folk songs collector (and later a senior state official) Tertiy Filippov was portraiyed as Milashin. "Benevolensky, Dobrotvorsky and Merich were all real people among those Ostrovsky was meeting in the Korsh's house, or elsewhere. In reality there was no such marriage as the one shown in the play. Z.F.Korsh died a maiden in the early 1880s", V.A.Grigoryev wrote.
History.
Ostrovsky first mentioned "The Poor Bride" in a letter to Pogodin in the summer of 1850. On October 31 that year he recited fragments of it in his editor’s home. In the summer of 1851 the play was finished but the author continued to make changes to the text. On November 3 he informed Pogodin: "The comedy has lagged behind a bit for I've heard Pisemsky's comedy ["The Hyppochondriac"] and found it necessary to embellish my own a bit so as not to blush for it".
In December the play was submitted to censors and on January 1, 1852 Ostrovsky received the permission for a separate edition of it to be published. On February 19 the permission for the magazine publication was obtained and the play appeared in the February (book 2) issue of "Moskvityanin". In 1859 "The Poor Bride" was re-issued as part of "The Works by A.N.Ostrovsky" in two volumes (published by Count Kushelev-Bezborodko), again with numerous changed to the text, made by its author. This version of the text is considered to be the final one and it has been reproduced in numerous collections and anthologies that appeared later. Ostrovsky approached a Maly Theater inspector Alexey Verstovsky, a well-known composer and he received "The Poor Bride" conditionally, pending consors' verdict. It took half a year for censors to give the permission. On September 1852 "The Poor Bride" was pronounced eligible for stage production much to the credit of censor Gederstern who saw it as a romantic drama and ignored its social undercurrents. Two roles, those of Dunya and Pasha, though, have been retrieved and returned only in October 1861. Much rile by the way the text has been mangled, Ostrovsky asked Verstovsky to delay the production of the "Bride" and wait for his next play ("Keep to Your Own Sledge") he's been working upon already.
"The Poor Bride" was premiered in Maly Theater on August 20, 1853 with Saburova as Nezabudkina, E.N.Vasilieva (Marya Andreevna), Cherkassov (Merich), S.S.Vasiliev (Milashin), Shuisky (Dobrotvorsky), Prov Sadovsky (Benevolensky), Poltavtsev (Khorjkov), Akimova (Khorjkova). 
On October 12, 1863, the play was performed in Aleksandrinka, as a benefice for actreess Maria Chitau (Marya Andreevna). The play was permitted for production in people's theaters only on May 3, 1893, with roles of Dunya and Pasha excised.
Reception.
On March 20, 1852, Aleksey Pisemsky wrote to Ostrovsky: "I've read the comedy of yours with the greatest of pleasure and found it not just equal but even superior to "It's a Family Affair - We’ll Settle It Ourselves" Its humour is more subtle and soulful while characters are so vivid they even visit me in dreams." Ivan Turgenev opined that the play failed to meet the expectations which were too high after "Family Affair", but found "it's general colour very true" and "the second act beautiful from the first word to the last. In 1879, re-issuing his article, Turgenev admitted in the comment that he was wrong in his assessment of the play and called it "one of the dramatist's best". Nikolai Chernyshevsky found the play "very good" even if finding it, next to "Family Affair", as lacking the latter's "main virtue, the sense of revelation".
In 1859 Nikolai Dobrolyubov provided the most full analysis of the play. Having described in full the difficult situation Marya Andreevna, the "poor bride", found herself in, the critic asked: "What this hapless creature suffers all these insults for, what keeps her in this mire?" - and gave the answer: "It is obvious, what: she is a poor bride, she has nothing to do other than sit there waiting or go seeking for the right kind of fiancée... Modern liberals scorn this, but one would like to know - what is there left in our society to do for a young girl who fails to marry?" According to Dobrolyubov, in his play Ostrovsky gave "the direct answer" to the most important question of the day: "why in our families a woman finds herself in a slave-like situation and why does samodurstvo tyranny torments her especially bad."

William Schull

William Jackson (Jack) Schull (born 17 March 1922) is an American geneticist and Professor Emeritus of Human Genetics at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. He has worked for the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Japan, was one of the founding members of the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Michigan, and was the founding director of the Center for Demographic and Population Genetics at The University of Texas at Houston. His scientific contributions include studies on the effects of ionizing radiation on human health, the role of heredity and the interaction of heredity and environment in the etiology of chronic disease, the effects of inbreeding in human populations, the mechanisms of adaptations to hypoxic conditions, and the genetic epidemiology of populations burdened by chronic diseases associated with low socio-economic status.
Early life, military service, and education.
Schull was born in Louisiana, Missouri, the first son and second child of Eugene Schull, a shoe cutter, and Edna Gertrude Davenport. Among his distant relatives there were at least three geneticists, George H. Shull, the discoverer or hybrid vigor, A. Franklin Shull, a geneticist at the University of Michigan, and Franklin Shull’s daughter, Elizabeth “Tibby” Buckley Shull Russell, a past president of the Genetics Society of America. In the mid-1920s, the Schull family moved to St. Louis, Missouri and later to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Schull started his academic studies at Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1939. In December 1942 he enlisted in the army and served as surgical technician with the 37th Infantry Division in the South Pacific until December 1945. After the war, he finished his bachelor degree in Zoology at Marquette in 1946, and then went on to obtain a master degree in Zoology in 1947. 
On 7 September 1946, Schull married Victoria (Vicky) Margaret Novak at Saint John the Divine Catholic Church in Milwaukee. They were inseparable for 63 years, until her death on Tuesday, October 13, 2009 at the age of 87. 
In 1949, he completed his Ph.D. degree at the Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. On that degree’s completion, Schull had an offer at McGill University, but he turned it down and accepted an offer to go to Japan and work with the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission. He served as its Chair of the Department of Genetics from 1949 to 1951.
Research description.
Schull’s research dealt with many subjects in human genetics and his 1954 textbook “Human Heredity” (coauthored with James V. Neel) was the first genetics textbook to rely almost solely on examples from human populations. Chief among his earliest scientific interests are a large group of studies on human consanguinity (inbreeding) that spanned half a century of research and a wide geographical range. His first study, in 1953, concerned the effects of Christianity on the degree of inbreeding in Nagasaki. For his studies in Japan, information concerning thousands of people and entire communities was obtained on such items as birth date, birthplace, education, occupation, religion, date of marriage, previous marriages, consanguinitv, number of persons in the household, size of the house, diet, income, land holdings, attitudes toward reproduction, and a pregnancy-by-pregnancy listing of the reproductive performances of the husband and wife in this and previous unions. These data were regularly compared, where possible, with the existing records of various government agencies, such as the Koseki-ka (the office of custody of the koseki), the Hokensho (the public health office), the Zeimusho (the tax office), and the Nogyo and Gyogyo Kumiai (the agricultural and fishing cooperatives). In some of the studies in Japan, Schull and his co-authors discovered in excess of 15% of consanguineous marriages, some involve inbred husbands, inbred wives, or both. The negative effects of parental consanguinity and inbreeding were studied in relationship with socioeconomic status and variability. 
Another area of very active research concerned the effects of ionizing radiation in the exposed populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1981, Schull and colleagues summarized thirty-four years of study on the genetic effects of the atomic bomb, followed by a series of papers on the causes of mortality of A-bomb survivors. Schull has revisited the subject periodically, and readjusted its conclusions whenever new or revised data became available. In 2003, Schull published a synopsis on the children of atomic bomb survivors. 
Schull was one of the first researchers to concentrate on the interface between stress and morbidity. In particular, he studied socioeconomic stress, suppressed hostility, racism, and smoking on the well being of African-American populations in and around Detroit. 
In the pregenomic era, Schull advanced many methodological innovations in genetics from the field of epidemiological statistics, through practical measures of obesity, to the methodology of paternity exclusion. Of particular interest, at the time was the publication in 1967 of an entire volume of the American Journal of Human Genetics dedicated to the promotion of use of computers in the field human genetics. 
In the 1980s, Schull and colleagues pioneered a survey and an in-depth study on obesity, diabetes, gallbladder disease, hypertension, and other cardiovascular and metabolic afflictions among Mexican-Americans in Starr County, Texas. 
Other studies concern the genetics of the Aymara tribe in Chile and Bolivia, radiation carcinogenesis in humans, mutations, the genetics and epidemiology of chronic diseases, acheiropodia in Brazil, the adaptation of human populations to high altitudes, the measurement of Darwinian fitness in humans, the genetic structure of human populations, the genetics of night vision, circadian heart rate rhythmicity, the genetics of mental retardation, and cancer risks.
Public service.
Schull held many administrative positions in the sciences, including Vice Chairman and Chief of the Department of Epidemiology and Statistics of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima (1978–1980, 1996–1997), Director of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (1986–1987, 1990–1991), Director of the Center for Demographic and Population Genetics at The University of Texas Health Science Center (1972–1995), Director of the Medical Genetics Center of The University of Texas Health Science Center (1981–1994), and Director of the Human Genetics Center of University of Texas Health Science Center (1995–1998).
As far as professional organizations are concerned, Schull was a member of the Board of Directors and Secretary of the American Society of Human Genetics (1958–1961) and its President (1970). 
Dr. Schull’s scientific work was recognized by a great number of honors and awards. Among these honors are the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class, given by the Emperor of Japan in 1992 and the Silvio O. Conte Environmental Health Award in 1991. In 2004, A conversation with Schull was published in the section Voices of the journal Epidemiology. 
Schull served on the editorial boards of fifteen academic journal. Currently, he serves on the editorial boards of Acta Anthropogenetica, International Journal of Human Genetics, and International Journal of Radiation Medicine.
Selected publications.
Schull has authored, co-authored and edited 15 books, and has published in excess of 400 peer-reviewed original articles, invited articles, book chapters, book reviews, and scientific abstracts. His most notable and most cited publications are listed below.

Coppett was a small town located on the south coast of Newfoundland and Labrador north-east of Ramea. The first record of the community was in the 1857 census. Coppett grew steadily untile the 1930s and at its peak had a school and two lobster factories. Several factors including the collapse of the inshore cod fishery, lack of government services and isolation caused the community to be abandoned between 1945 and 1951 without government assistance. The majority of the inhabitants relocated to Ramea or Burgeo. Several properties on the island were maintained until the 1980s for use as summer homes.

Raop (album)

Raop is the debut album by German singer-songwriter Cro. The album was released on July 6, 2012 through Chimperator Productions. It sold 60,000 copies units in Germany in its first week. On March 23, the first single off the album, "Easy" was released. In June 2012, Cro's single "Easy" was certificated as Gold. Also, the music video gained 20,000,000 views on YouTube. From June 29 until July 1, Cro released one Single each day, "Du", "King of Raop", and "Meine Zeit". Music videos were also filmed for every single. All of his five released Singles were placed in the Top 100 in the German Single-Charts.
Background.
Cro worked on the album for one and a half months. On April 19, 2012 it was announced the album would be released on July 6, 2012. It was titled "Raop" after Cro's description of his music genre. He says it is a mixture between rap and pop. On May 24, 2012 the album cover was first uncovered.
Versions.
The album was released in five different versions, a Standard version, including 13 songs, a Vinyl LP, also including the 13 songs, a Premium Edition, including 2 more songs, 4 remixes, and a DVD of the making-of the album, "Road to Raop", a Limited "Panda Banda Deluxe" Edition, which includes the 13 songs, 2 bonus songs, 4 remixes, the DVD and instrumentals of all of the songs, and an exclusive Amazon Edition, which includes the 13 songs, 2 bonus songs, 4 remixes, the DVDs, instrumentals of all of the songs, a T-Shirt, and a playbutton which can play all of the 13 songs.
Production.
"Raop" was mostly produced by Cro himself. While he had often used samples for his earlier mixtapes he had to waive using portions of other songs. The reason was the short production progress which lead to him not having enough time to obtain consent for using samples. Cro changed his working procedure to recording his own melodies.
Marketing.
Singles.
Three songs from the album were released as singles. These were released on three consecutive days. "Du" was released on June 29, 2012. "King of Raop" was released as a promotional single on June 30. "Meine Zeit" was released on July 1 as the last promotional single. Music videos were also made for all of the three songs. On June 28, 2012 the music video for "Du" was published on tape.tv. Following that, was the video for "King of Raop" which was filmed by a company from Stuttgart called "Formzwei". The video for "Meine Zeit" was released by "Juice Magazine". Parts of the video were filmed on the roof terrace of "Chimperator Productions". On October 27, Cro released the music video for his fifth single "Einmal um die Welt" which was released on November 2.
Tour.
On May 5, 2012 Cro embarked on the "Road to Raop Festival Tour" during which he has been visiting many festivals. During the tour he has visited Rock am Ring and Rock im Park and Splash! Festival. The tour is supposed to end on September 22, 2012. On October 1, Cro embarked on the "Raop Tour".

Caliban's Dream

"Caliban's Dream" is a track written by Rick Smith of electronic group Underworld for the "Isles of Wonder" opening ceremony of the 2012 summer Olympics in London, and the 14th and final track of the first disc of the official soundtrack.
Writing and recording.
Smith told how the brief for the piece was given: "Frank [(Cottrell-Boyce), the opening ceremony's writer] and Danny [(Boyle), its creative director] put forward beautiful, transcendental poems by people like WH Auden, Thomas Nash, Philip Larkin. They set the tone for Caliban's Dream. Very early on Danny encouraged me not to think in terms of "Eye of the Tiger" for the final stages; we weren't looking for anything testosterone-fuelled. Those poetic ideas that we had talked about initially just seemed so beautiful; we wanted to draw them in to the story of the torch. Karl [(Hyde), Smith's partner in Underworld] spent a long time working with those words to make them flow, helping avoid all the possible cliches we could fall prey to." 
The track features performances by Alex Trimble (lead singer and guitarist of Two Door Cinema Club), percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie, the Dockhead Choir conducted by Mag Shepherd, Only Men Aloud male voice choir, soprano Elizabeth Roberts, and Esme Smith (co-writer with Rick Smith of the soprano and choral score). Glennie played a newly developed percussion instrument, the Aluphone, on the track.
The orchestra was elements of the London Symphony Orchestra, orchestrated and conducted by Geoffrey Alexander. The singers were Will Balkwill, Zoe Brown, Ronan Busfield, Emily Dickens, Elizabeth Drury, James Hall, Johnny Herford, Katy Hill, Jimmy Holliday, Eloise Irving, Gareth John, Oliver Jones, Christopher Lowrey, Philippa Murray, Robyn Allegra Parton, Catherine Pope, Alison Rose, Domhnall Talbot, Reuben Thomas and Amy Wood. The drums were played by Paul Clarvis, Barnaby Archer, Oliver Blake, Daniel Bradley, Rebecca Celebuski, Jason Chowdhury, Jonathan Colgan, Oliver Cox, Fabio de Oliveira, Mike Dolbear, Robert Eckland, Daniel Ellis, Richard Elsworth, David Holmes, Oliver Lowe, Nicola Marangoni, James O’Carroll, Gerard Rundell, Ramon Sherrington, Corrina Silvester, Alex Smith, Owain Williams and Justin Woodward. The drum score was arranged by Rick Smith and Paul Clarvis.
Performance at the Olympics.
"Caliban's Dream" was performed for the first time on 27 July 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in London, as the Olympic cauldron was lit by the seven young athletes. The title refers to Caliban in "The Tempest" by William Shakespeare, whose 'Be not afeard' speech Sir Kenneth Branagh, as 19th Century engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, had recited earlier in the ceremony - a speech from the play's Act 3, Scene 2, in which Caliban refers to his dreams:
<poem>
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
Will make me sleep again; and then in dreaming,
The clouds methought would open, and show riches
Ready to drop upon me, that when I awaked,
I cried to dream again!
</poem>
The track reprises the whistling leitmotif first heard during the minute's silence section of "And I Will Kiss", earlier in the ceremony. This time, it is sung by a children's choir, then whistled, then both together. 
The lyrics for the song were written specifically for the opening ceremony by Underworld’s Rick Smith and sung by Alex Trimble.
<poem>
Oh,
And the rain tossed about us, in the garden of the world,
But a flame arrives to guide us, cast in gold between the anvils of the stars
Watch you over all your children in the rain, and the streets where I remember,
Where the fire lights are candle souls again.
Affirming flame, hear me call.
Through the darkness, hear it call to us all.
And stir again.
This beating heart, come to care.
Oh,
And the light drive out our fears, And the joy drive out our pain,
And the nations come to greet us, waving open arms like waves of golden corn.
Ever hear us, oh the spirit of the world. May your light be ever near us,
Always lead us from the dark, though we may fall.
We will fly.
And with love, ever call.
</poem>
At the climax of the track, as the cauldron is lit, a single tuned bell tolls five times. The main riff beneath this section is taken from Underworld's 2002 single Two Months Off, whose main lyric is "You bring light in".

Wattlesborough Castle

Wattlesborough Castle is a ruined fortified 13th century manor house in Shropshire.
Based in the parish of Alberbury with Cardeston, near the village of Halfway House on the Shrewsbury to Welshpool road, the castle was probably built in the late 13th century for Sir Richard Corbet. It comprised a square two storey tower surrounded by a moated enclosure with a fishpond.
It was bought by the Leighton family circa 1501 and used as their chief residence until circa 1711. At that time an adjoining farm building was constructed and named Wattlesborough Hall.
The castle is a Grade 1 listed scheduled monument. Only the roofless tower remains and its condition is officially classified as poor. English Heritage are in discussions with the owners to decide the best way of preserving the building.

Thomas Paine Monument

The Thomas Paine Monument is a bronze sculpture located in New Rochelle, New York, dedicated to perpetuating the legacy of Founding Father Thomas Paine. The monument stands on North Avenue at the entrance to Paine Avenue, between the Thomas Paine National Historical Association to the north and the property of the Huguenot and Historical Association of New Rochelle to the south. This is the oldest extant memorial to Thomas Paine. The original monument erected in 1839 consisted of just a tapered marble pedestal and decorative cap. A bronze bust of Paine was later added in 1899.
Detail.
The creation of the monument was organized and carried to completion through the efforts of Paine biographer and New York publisher, Gilbert Vale and funded through public subscription. Sculptor and architect John Frazee created the marble monument itself on an 18 x 20 foot plot cut out of the lane and enclosed on three sides by a stone wall, and an iron fence an gate on the fourth. The monument suffered significant damage from vandals and relic hunters between 1839 to 1881. Parts of the inscription were defaced and the square corners of both the base and shaft were broken off. In the latter year the monument was repaired and restored as far as possible, the broken and ragged corners were rounded and parts of the inscription re-cut. This work was done at the instance of the Liberal Club of New York City, after which a re-dedication ceremony was held on May 30, 1881.
The bronze bust of Paine surmounting the original monument was modeled by sculptor James Wilson Alexander MacDonald. It was presented to the Thomas Paine Historical Association, and was placed on the capstone of the monument early in 1899. Soon thereafter the widening of North Avenue together with the opening of the present Paine Avenue as a public street over the identical course of the original Davoue and Paine lane, necessitated the removal of the monument from its original position. In 1905 the monument was placed in its present location in the center of Paine Avenue. Up to this time its care had been in the hands of private organizations and the Thomas Paine Historical Association, but on October 14, 1905, the monument was formally presented to and accepted by the City of New Rochelle.
The bust of Paine measures approximately 4 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet and the marble pedestal is approximately 10-1/2 feet x 3 feet 7 inches x 3 feet 7 inches. The monument rests on a base which is approximately 8 inches x 6 feet 7 inches x 6 feet 7 inches in measurement.

High Com

The High Com (also as HIGH COM, both written with a thin space) noise reduction system was developed by Telefunken, Germany, in the 1970s as a high quality high compression analogue compander for audio recordings.
The idea of a compander for consumer devices was based on studies of a fixed two-band compander by Jürgen Wermuth of AEG-Telefunken ELA, Wolfenbüttel, developer of the Telefunken four-band audio compander for professional use. In April 1974, the resulting "RUSW-200" prototype led to the development of a sliding two-band compander by Ernst F. Schröder of Telefunken Grundlagenlaboratorium, Hannover since July 1974. Finally, the released High Com system, which was marketed by Telefunken since 1978, worked as a broadband 2:1:2 compander, achieving around 10 dB of noise reduction for low and up to 20 dB A-weighted for higher frequencies, while avoiding most of the acoustic problems observed with other high compression broadband companders such as dbx.
In order to facilitate cost-effective mass-production in consumer devices such as cassette decks, the compander system was integrated into an analogue IC, TFK U401B / U401BG / U401BR, developed by Dietrich Höppner und Kurt Hintzmann of AEG-Telefunken Halbleiterwerk, Heilbronn. With minimal changes in the external circuitry the IC could also be used to emulate a Dolby B-compatible expander as in the DNR (Dynamic Noise Reduction) system for backward compatibility.
Nakamichi, one of the more than 20 licensees of the High Com system, insisted on using a sliding-band compander, so High Com was further developed into the two-band High Com II and three-band High Com III sliding-band 2:1:2 systems by Werner Scholz and Ernst F. Schröder of Telefunken and Harron K. Appleman of Nakamichi in 1978/1979. This variant was eventually released as "Nakamichi High-Com II Noise Reduction System" in 1979/1980, increasing the amount of noise reduction on analogue recordings and transmissions by as much as 25 dB A-weighted.
Besides Telefunken's own "CN 750" High Com compander box and Nakamichi's High-Com II unit, other companies also offered external High Com compander boxes such as the Aiwa "HR-7" and "HR-50" or the Rotel "RN-500" and "RN-1000". A low-cost implementation of the Telefunken High Com system as external compander box became available as HobbyCom, promoted for do-it-yourself assembly in the popular WDR TV series Hobbythek format by Jean Pütz in 1980.
Similar to the earlier Dolby FM system in the USA, a High Com FM system was evaluated in Germany between July 1979 and December 1981 by IRT. It was based on the High Com broadband compander, but was never introduced commercially in FM broadcasting.
While originally designed for tape recordings, Nakamichi demonstrated the usage of High Com II on vinyl records as well in 1979. In 1982 the same AEG-Telefunken team, who designed the High Com noise reduction system, also developed the IC "U2141B" for the CBS Laboratories CX noise reduction system for vinyl records.
While implemented in dozens of European and Japanese consumer device models and acoustically much superior to the Dolby B and C systems, the High Com family of systems never gained a similar market penetration. This was caused by several factors, including the existing pre-dominance of the Dolby system, with Dolby Laboratories introducing the "good enough" Dolby C update (with up to 15 dB A-weighted improvement) around 1980 as well, and also by the fact that High Com required higher quality tape decks and tapes to work with in order to give satisfactory results.
High Com II even required calibration of the playback level using a 400 Hz calibration tone for optimum results, and with prices in the several hundred dollars for the external Nakamichi compander box it was much too expensive to be used by many people outside the small group of audiophiles using high-end tape recorders or open-reel decks.
When AEG-Telefunken struggled financially in 1981/1982 and the Hannover development site was partially disbanded and refocused on digital technologies in 1983, this also put the High Com development to an end. The latest tape decks to come with High Com were produced around 1986.

Carmen Busquets

Carmen Busquets is a Venezuelan pioneer luxury and fashion entrepreneur. She is involved with Internet fashion and is known for being the major founding investor, and board director of Net-a-Porter until 2010, when she sold the majority of her shares to Richemont Group. She is also the founder of CoutureLab. Busquets retains a 2.3% stake in Net-a-Porter; she is also a board member and investor of Astley Clarke and an early investor of Moda Operandi, Maiyet, The Business of Fashion, Lyst and ASAP 54. 
Early life and education.
Carmen Busquets was born in Venezuela. She was educated in Venezuela, England, Canada and the United States, and she majored in science and arts before studying marketing and advertising at the University of Miami.
Career.
Early career.
In 1990, Busquets opened a high fashion boutique in Caracas, Venezuela called Cabus. Following a 10-year ban on foreign imports, it became the first store in Venezuela to stock Europe’s top designers and rapidly developed a prestigious international client base. Busquets then began to sell couture from photographs taken at European catwalk shows to private clients in Venezuela and across the globe. Her success was such that it propelled her interest in e-commerce and the Internet.
In 1997, at the beginning of the dot-com bubble, Busquets started to build her small private stock-portfolio of Internet investments. She also co-founded two private online start-ups during the Internet bubble, an experience that taught her the importance of being a responsible investor and only partnering with other responsible investors.
Net-a-Porter.
Busquets was the major founding investor and an original board director of Net-a-Porter, investing an initial £250,000 in 2000 against the opinion of her advisers. While backing Net-a-Porter, Busquets personally vouched for its creditworthiness to designers with whom she had long-standing relationships. Over a five-year period, she increased her stake to £5.9 million. In 2003, realising the importance of securing a strategic partner for the company, she temporarily gave up her pre-emptive investor rights in order to let Richemont Group become a co-investor. She gained her rights back once Richemont had invested in the company. For seven years, Busquets and Richemont remained controlling co-investors, each with a 30% shareholding and both playing a pivotal role in growing the value of the company. 
In 2010, Busquets exercised her controlling rights and was instrumental in the successful sale of Net-a-Porter to Richemont Group for £350 million. She retains a 2.3% shareholding in the business.
CoutureLab.
In 2006, Busquets founded CoutureLab as a "laboratory of ideas" and a brand focused on supporting craftsmanship and heritage. CoutureLab is an e-commerce gift website, which sells rare products from around the world, made by specialist craftsmen, artists, designers and brands. Busquets's aim is to offer a unique selection of expertly curated products, to support some of world’s top creative talents and educate consumers about the story behind the product.
CoutureLab has an extensive international clientele and a global reach. The company delivers to over 128 countries in 72 hours (or less), processing payments in multiple currencies. CoutureLab works with more than 100 designers and 80% of the products are handcrafted. The integrity of the brand has earned CoutureLab strong customer loyalty, with return rates as high as 60%. The CoutureLab website receives over 25,000 visitors per month from 65 countries worldwide. In 2008, some first-time buyers were spending £10,000, and the value of the average order was £1,000.
In April 2012, CoutureLab launched its gifting service GiftLab, increasing CoutureLab’s range of products and establishing several key distribution partnerships online.
Awards and events.
In May 2011, Busquets won the Individual Outstanding Achievement at the "Luxury Briefing" Awards. The award recognized her vision to invest in selling fashion online in the early days of the Internet, her substantial value addition to Net-a-Porter culminating in its successful sale, and the creation of CoutureLab, with its focus on craftsmanship. In 2012, Busquets was a member of the jury at the 16th annual "Luxury Briefing" Awards held at the Corinthia Hotel London.
On 11 November 2011, Busquets spoke at the "International Herald Tribune's" Luxury Business Conference at Hotel Unique in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Busquets discussed how her Latin American background has equipped her with the skills required to achieve commercial success and her views on the union of sustainability, community and luxury.
On 19 March 2012 at the Sommet du Luxe et de la Création in Paris, Busquets and other notable figures from the luxury trade industry discussed the tension between global brands and luxury labels.
Media.
In July 2008, the "New York Times" quoted Busquets who was discussing Net-a-porter at Paris Fashion Week: "I never invested in Net-a-Porter with the thought that I would be one of the major investors. I was quite open to being one of the minor investors. But since nobody believed in Internet companies after 2000, it turned out that I had to be the major investor, because I was the only one to believe in it."
In August 2012, "Wallpaper" magazine published an article by Imran Amed, founder and editor of "The Business of Fashion", reviewing London’s growing technology and fashion scenes. Amed identifies Busquets as being among a handful of investors who: "cashed in during the UK’s Internet 1.0 wave and are now actively investing in the next generation of start-ups."
In September 2012, the "New York Times" published Fashion’s New Order, a select list of 37 individuals including designers, retailers, editors and stylists who have "changed the way we see fashion in the 21st century". Busquets was included in the Fashion’s New Order list alongside "Vogue" editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet and fashion mogul Bernard Arnault.
In May 2013, "Vogue" profiled Busquets in an article written by Elisabetta Tudor regarding her investment in pre-owned fashion marketplace BuyMyWardrobe
In May 2013, The Business of Fashion published an article titled "Carmen Busquets Enters Fashion ‘Re-Commerce’ Space with BuyMyWardrobe Investment"
In May 2013, Styl.sh published an article titled "Carmen Busquets invests in BuyMyWardrobe"
In May 2013, WWB published an article titled "Carmen Busquets invests in BuyMyWardrobe"
In September 2013, The Business Of Fashion featured Busquets in the BoF 500: a list of the 500 most influential names in the global fashion industry.

Hough Windmill

Hough windmill, Swannington, Leicestershire is a tower windmill built in the late 18th century on the boundary between Swannington, Leicestershire and Thringstone. The mill served a coal mining community, the structure is surrounded by the remains of ancient shallow coal mines and local maps show many footpaths, -tracks made by the miners who walked between them. The mill and surrounding area is owned by the Swannington Heritage Trust.
Previous Mills.
At least five mills were built on high ground to the north of Swannington and were operated by three local milling families, the Griffins, Chesters and the Kerbys. The earliest structures were post mills -a more primitive, less stable but far cheaper design where the entire mill body must be rotated to face the wind. Over the years all succumbed to fire, storm or decay, the last killing its owner when it collapsed in the early 1800s. Dismantled and reassembled nearby, the mill operated until 1895 when the components were sold.
Present Mill.
John Griffin built the present structure, replacing a nearby post mill and purchasing land from the Enclosure Commissioners in 1804. The mill was operated by his tenant, James Kerby who paid an annual rent of £30. In 1877, it was sold to John Hough, steward to the Beaumonts of Coleorton, for £1,175, the Kerby family continuing until replaced by the last commercial tenant, Walter Chester. The mill closed early in the 20th century by which time the technology was obsolete. 
The derelict mill was listed in the 1980s and compulsory purchased by North West Leicestershire District Council who sold it to Swannington Heritage Trust in 1994. The Trust refurbished the mill with the aid of a £70,883 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It was opened by Mr David Taylor, MP, on the 26th March 2000 and attracted 1,600 visitors during the first year.
Inside the mill is a poster advertising the sale of a mill on Thringstone common by auction at the New Inn at Peggs Green. Both properties were part of Thringstone Civil Parish until its abolition in April 1936, Hough Mill being part of 70 acres transferred to Swannington whilst the New Inn was part of 98 acres transferred to Coleorton.
Gorse Field and Califat Spinney.
The Trust also owns the adjacent 6 acre gorse field, part of an unfarmed ancient common with evidence of hundreds of bell pits for coal mining dating back to 1204. This is being turned into a nature reserve. The replica ginn engine (see photo, left) was funded by the National Forest company.
Next to the Gorse Field is Califat Spinney which includes two engine houses from the coal mine that operated from 1855-1873. 
One of the mine shafts was called the Alabama shaft. Whilst the date is uncertain, it was practice at the time to name shafts after contemporary events, the CSS Alabama was sunk by the US Navy off the coast of Cherbourg, France in 1864. A horse-drawn tramway carried coal from the Califat mine to the bottom of the Swannington Incline where the winding engine pulled the trucks to the top of the incline to continue its journey along the Leicester and Swannington Railway. In 1863 water entered the Califat mine from a disused mine at Limby Hall. The mine flooded in 11 minutes and three miners were killed.

Jakub W.J. Pacholski

Jakub Wałenty Jan Pacholski, better known in America as Monsignor James W.J. Pacholski, was born on May 24, 1862 in the village of Pączewo, located in the Polish region of Kociewie. He was educated at Pelplin and Wejherowo, and studied for the priesthood at Leuven, Belgium. After emigration to the United States, he completed his studies at Saint Thomas Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where he was ordained to the priesthood on June 18, 1886.
Just one month after his ordination, Reverend Pacholski was called upon to organize Holy Cross Parish in Minneapolis. He served as pastor at Holy Cross until 1894. He was then transferred to the Diocese of Winona and installed as pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish, in Winona, Minnesota. This growing parish had experienced a good deal of turmoil in recent years, and it is clear that Reverend Pacholski was expected to bring some needed order. This he accomplished.
As pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, Reverend Pacholski oversaw the completion and dedication of the 1895 church, and of the parish school constructed in 1905. He was instrumental in the establishment of Saint Casimir's, a daughter parish of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, on Winona's West End, and celebrated the first Holy Mass at Saint Casimir's on Christmas Day 1905.
Father Pacholski held the office of Consultor to the Most Reverend Joseph B. Cotter, first Bishop of Winona, which was a very unusual honor for a Polish-born priest serving in an American diocese. He was elevated to the rank of Monsignor by Pope Benedict XV on August 17, 1918. He was admired and loved by his parishioners as a stern shepherd who always cared deeply for his beloved flock; in his role as pastor of Saint Stanislaus Kostka he was also regarded as the leader of Winona's Kaszubian Polish community.
The Right Reverend Monsignor Jakub W.J. Pacholski died unexpectedly of a heart attack on July 27, 1932, at the Saint Stanislaus rectory. He was succeeded as pastor by his former assistant, the Winona-educated Father Jozef Cieminski. There were as many as 2,000 mourners at his funeral, including over 100 fellow priests. Reverend Pacholski is buried at Saint Mary's Cemetery in Winona, alongside other leading clerics of the diocese.

<doc id="36585497" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36585497" title="Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope">
Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope

The Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope functioned as the Legislature of the Cape Colony, from its founding in 1853, until the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, when it was dissolved and the Parliament of South Africa was established.
It consisted of the House of Assembly (the lower house) and the legislative council (the upper house).
The First Parliament.
Prior to Responsible Government, the British government granted the Cape Colony a rudimentary and relatively powerless Legislative Council in 1835.
The British attempt to turn the Cape into a penal colony for convicts, similar to Australia, mobilised the local population in the 1840s and threw up a generation of local leaders who believed that far-away Britain was not capable of understanding local interests and issues. This group of politicians, which included the likes of Porter, Solomon, Fairbairn, Molteno, Stockenström and Jarvis, shared not only a common belief in the importance of local self-government, but also an explicit commitment to a liberal, inclusive and multi-racial political system.
This political elite successfully began the controversial drive for Cape independence which, unusually, was attained in the end through gradual evolution, rather than sudden revolution.
Representative Government (1853).
The Queen granted the Cape its first Parliament in 1853, and the local leadership were permitted to draft a constitution. This was a relatively liberal document that prohibited race or class discrimination, and instituted the non-racial Cape Qualified Franchise, whereby the same qualifications for suffrage were applied equally to all males, regardless of race. However, the parliament was weak and executive power remained firmly in the hands of the Governor who was appointed from London.
The British Governor opened this first parliament at his residence, "the Tuynhuys", but the House of Assembly soon relocated to the small but stately Goede Hoop Masonic Lodge buildings. The old Legislative Council (now reconstituted as the Parliament's upper house) was housed at the nearby Old Supreme Court building (now the Iziko Slave Lodge Museum).
Responsible Government (1872).
A faction of the Cape's powerful local leaders, under the leadership of John Molteno, pushed for further independence in the form of "Responsible Government". This was attained in 1872, bringing all branches of the Cape's government under local control and making the Executive directly "responsible" to Parliament and the electorate for the first time.
There followed a brief boom period in the history of the Cape, with the economy surging, the frontiers stable and local democracy taking root. 
The new constitution held the non-racial nature of its political system as one of its core values. The universal qualification for suffrage (£25) was sufficiently low to ensure that most owners of any form of property or land could vote; and there was a determination on the part of the Government not to raise it, on the understanding that inflation would eventually render it obsolete. 
There were the early beginnings of a drive to register the many new potential voters, particularly the rural Xhosa people of the frontier region, who were mostly communal land owners and therefore eligible for suffrage. Opportunistic politicians soon followed, to campaign for Black African voters.
The new government based itself in the halls of the Masonic Lodge where the previous parliaments had sat. This relatively humble building was seen as suitably central and close to the Legislative Council building. 
The large gardens of the Lodge soon became a popular venue for the public, with concerts, theatre and finally the "South African International Exhibition" which Molteno sponsored in 1877. 
The Parliamentary hall itself was open to members of the public, also explicitly ""irrespective of class or colour"", should they wish to observe the performance of their representatives.
The operating language of the parliament in the early years of Responsible Government was English, though Afrikaans was often spoken informally. Dutch was added by parliamentary act in 1882, by MP "Onze Jan" Hofmeyr with the powerful support of Saul Solomon. A statement was also made, on its introduction, that the recognition of a "Native" language, as a third official language, would also be acceptable, but only once sufficient "Native" parliamentarians were elected.
The new Parliament building.
The building fiasco.
From the beginning of Responsible Government, there were increasingly vocal complaints from members of parliament about the humble appearance of their venue. MPs increasingly complained that the Parliament would not attract sufficient respect from "the public and strangers", unless a more grandiose edifice were constructed.
A brief controversy arose about this need to build a more stately Parliament, as Prime Minister Molteno was not an ostentatious man, and had little interest in spending tax money on what he saw as essentially an expensive vanity project (At the time an enormous countrywide programme was underway, of building schools, public transport and communications infrastructure, and funds were consequently in tight demand). He was over-ruled by the legislature however, and the Commissioner of Public Works, Charles Abercrombie Smith, ordered a select committee to receive designs. The committee selected the elaborate proposal of the renowned architect Charles Freeman, at the time an officer in the Public Works Department.
Sites that were mooted for the new building included Greenmarket Square, Caledon Square and the top of Government Avenue, but eventually the current site was selected. 
Freeman was made resident architect and construction began on 12 May 1875, with Governor Henry Barkly laying the cornerstone.
Almost immediately it was discovered that Freeman's plans were faulty. Freeman's errors were compounded by the presence of groundwater, and a recalculation of the budget revealed that the actual costs would be many times the original figure that the government had allowed for.
The Cape government stepped in. Freeman was fired for incompetence and the Public Works Commission was re-structured. There was initially some discussion in parliament about abandoning the half-finished building. However, the government ordered the project completed, even though the budget was now calculated to be many times the original sum. In 1876 it appointed Henry Greaves to alter Freeman's plans, fix the faulty foundations, and see the project successfully through. Moreover it ordered him to remove from the plan the statues, parapets, fountains, elaborate dome and other expensive flourishes.
Building re-commenced, but was delayed once again – this time by the British overthrow of the Cape government in 1878, the ensuing Confederation Wars, and finally by the building company going bankrupt in 1883. 
Greaves tenaciously completed the job however, and the large, stately, but relatively unpretentious building was finally opened in 1884.
Cape Prime Minister Thomas Scanlen, and British Governor Henry Robinson led the opening ceremony in the building, declared finally to be worthy of the country's Legislature.
The restricting of the multi-racial franchise.
Over the years, as the Cape's early generation of political heavy-weights died or retired, power moved away from their liberal heirs, and towards pro-imperialist opposition politicians who wanted stronger ties with the British Empire and saw the multi-racial franchise as a threat to white political control.
This radical opposition had its origins in the white Eastern Cape separatist movement who had been threatened by the political mobilisation of their Xhosa neighbours. It gained office under Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg, and eventually reached the height of its power as the pro-imperialist "Progressive Party" under Prime Minister Cecil John Rhodes, the most dictatorial and aggressively expansionist leader in Cape history.
The liberals (now on the defensive, as the opposition "South African Party") attempted to further mobilise the Cape's Black population in a desperate attempt to find allies to the liberal & multi-racial cause. However they were outmaneuvered by Rhodes and his allies, who imposed increasingly severe legal restrictions on the African franchise. As fast as the African voters mobilised, their numbers were diminished through discriminatory legislation.
The Parliamentary Registration Act (1887) removed traditional African forms of communal land-ownership from the franchise qualifications, thus disenfranchising a large portion of the Cape's Xhosa population. 
Rhodes's Franchise and Ballot Act (1892) finally succeeded in raising the franchise qualification from £25 to £75, disenfranchising the poorest classes of all race groups (including poor whites) but effecting a disproportionately large percentage of the African voters. It also added literacy as a franchise qualification, intended to target the (still mostly illiterate) Xhosa voters of the Cape. 
Finally, the Glen Grey Act (1894) re-drew the laws on rural African land tenure and effectively disqualified nearly all rural Africans from the vote.
The end result was that, by the end of Rhodes's Ministry, only a small portion of relatively wealthy, educated, urban Black Africans were still permitted to vote. 
Decades later, with the rise of Apartheid after Union, all restrictions were removed for White voters, meaning that the remaining qualifications of the Cape Qualified Franchise only applied to non-whites.
Move towards Union.
In the early twentieth century, following the tumults of the Anglo-Boer wars, the whole of southern Africa was finally under the control of the British Empire. The union of the various component states of the region was once again discussed. Several previous attempts at union had failed, but in 1909 a National Convention was instituted in Cape Town, to unite the Cape of Good Hope with Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange Free State, to form a united country of "South Africa". 
The Convention met in the Cape Assembly's chamber of the Cape Parliament building, and it was here that the new constitution for South Africa was drawn up.
The Union of South Africa was proclaimed the following year, in 1910, and the old Cape Parliamentary building became the home of the new Parliament of South Africa. The provincial government of the Cape, now the "Cape Province", was set up in a new building nearby, the Pronvisiale-gebou.
Parliaments & Ministries of the Cape of Good Hope.
Ministries of the Cape of Good Hope (1872–1910).
The parliament's executive governments ("Ministries") dated only from 1872, when the Cape first attained responsible government. Prior to that parliament worked under a Governor, who was appointed by the British Colonial Office in London.
The post of prime minister of the Cape Colony also became extinct on 31 May 1910, when it joined the Union of South Africa.
Political parties.
For much of the Cape's history, the parliament operated without formal political parties. Instead, parliamentarians aligned temporarily – according to specific issues. 
Nonetheless, informal parties began to form according to the constituencies overall attitude to long-standing issues, such as Responsible Government, the multi-racial franchise, territorial expansion, separatism and relations with the British Empire.
In the 1860s and early 70s, an alliance of parliamentarians came together in support of "Responsible Government". These parliamentarians distrusted British imperial rule; desired greater local independence; sought a greater focus on internal development rather than imperial expansion; and professed a strong commitment to racial and regional unity throughout the Cape. Prominent leaders were William Porter, Saul Solomon and John Molteno. 
This alliance later became known as the "Westerners" due to their headquarters in Cape Town.
Opposing them were a group of parliamentarians representing mainly white, British constituencies in the Eastern Cape near the frontier. Close to the neighbouring Xhosa lands, these politicians represented their constituents' fears of the more numerous Xhosa. They tended to support more direct British imperial rule, stronger policies regarding border defence and imperial expansion into Africa to open up lands for white settlement. They resented the political dominance of the more "liberal" Westerners and saw the solution to be a separate white "Eastern Cape Colony" under direct British rule, with Port Elizabeth as its capital. For much of this time they were led by the representative of Port Elizabeth, John Paterson. They were known as the "Easterners" or "Separatists".
In 1872, the Molteno Ministry brought together a broad alliance, run on liberal principles but incorporating several easterners and support from the Cape's Afrikaner and Black communities. Molteno's policies effectively extinguished the separatist movement, but the Eastern political bloc nonetheless survived and later came to power after the 1878 British takeover, when its new leader John Gordon Sprigg was appointed Prime Minister by the British Governor.
A key event was the founding of the Afrikaner Bond in 1881. This was the Cape's first formal political party, headed by Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan), and taking a strong stance for Afrikaner ("Cape Dutch") rights and against the political empowerment of the Cape's Black citizens. The formation of the Bond severely weakened the liberal "Westerners" by splitting the western bloc, and beginning their decline. 
The resulting three parties aligned differently according to the predominant issues of the day, with the Afrikaner Bond playing a central role as "King-maker": The Westerners and the Bond agreed on the need to minimise British intervention in southern Africa, while the Easterners and the Bond agreed on further restricting the rights of the Cape's Black citizens.
The easterners were by now known as "Progressives", and this pro-imperialist movement reached the height of its power under Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes's orchestration of the Jameson Raid sharply polarised the Cape's politics for the first time.
The remaining liberal "westerners" formed the "South African Party" but were too weak to oppose Rhodes's Progressives alone, and so allied with the Afrikaner Bond to fight Rhodes's dominance. This controversial alliance with the racist Bond caused many of the South African Party's black voters to abandon it. It came to power briefly under its liberal leader William Schreiner but overall the ensuing decades were dominated by the Progressive Party. 
In 1908, John X Merriman finally led the South African Party to electoral victory, a mere two years before the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910.
After Union, the South African Party merged with the Afrikaner Bond, Het Volk of the Transvaal and Orangia Unie of the Orange Free State, to form a new Union-wide South African Party. After this merger, the policies of the larger Afrikaner parties came to predominate and the distinctive liberalness of the original South African Party was subsumed, as South Africa began its long slide into Apartheid. 
Meanwhile, the Progressives (renamed the "Union Party of the Cape") merged with the Progressive Association of the Transvaal and the Constitutional Party of the Orange Free State to form the Unionist Party.

<doc id="36585594" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36585594" title="Disability tax credit">
Disability tax credit

The Disability Tax Credit (DTC) is a non-refundable tax credit in Canada for individuals who have a severe and prolonged impairment in physical or mental function. It qualifies as prolonged if it is expected to or has lasted at least 12 months. The DTC is required in order to qualify for the Registered Disability Savings Plan. Families using a Henson trust, the Canada Disability Child Benefit other estate planning methods for children with Disabilities are not excluded from the DTC and should consider whether they qualify.
Eligibility.
The individual must be "markedly restricted" in at least one of the following categories: speaking, hearing, walking, elimination (bowel or bladder functions), feeding, dressing, performing the mental functions of everyday life, life-sustaining therapy to support vital function and the recently introduced cumulative effects of significant restrictions.
The degree of disability must be approved by Canada Revenue Agency before it can be used, and this process requires the completion and submission of a form. The T2201 Disability Tax Credit Certificate form must be completed by a qualified professional related to the impairment such as a medical doctor, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, psychologist, audiologist, or optometrist, in order to qualify as having a severe and prolonged impairment. The practitioner must certify on the T2201 form that the impairment meets specific conditions within the set category. The conditions vary depending on impairment.
A document released by the Canadian Psychological Association (CPA) in response to suggestions they made to the House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities, attempts to assist medical professionals with deciphering what qualifies as being markedly restricted in the "mental functions necessary for everyday life".
In 2005, the CRA introduced a new category of eligibility, "cumulative effect of significant restrictions". This category is useful for individuals who are disabled but not restricted enough to qualify as being markedly restricted. Since this was introduced in 2005,an applicant may only be able to recapture funds since that point.
Benefits.
An applicant can file for the disability amount, back 10 years, due to the Tax Payer Relief Provisions in the Income Tax Act. The DTC amounts to C$1,600 in tax savings, and if filed for the full 10 year period the possible tax savings is 13,000 for adults, 20,000 for children 18 or under.
The DTC can be found on line 316 (for self) and line 318 (transferred to a supporting relative).
If the medical practitioner charges to complete the T2201 form, applicants can claim this as a medical expense on line 330 of his/her tax return.
In addition to lowering taxes, qualifying for tax credits can also be a requirement for applying for other money-saving vehicles such as the Registered Disability Savings Plan.
Transferring credits.
If the person with the impairment does Not have a taxable income, he/she can transfer credits to a supporting relative such as a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece nephew. It may also be transferred to a sibling but since this was only introduced in 2001 applicants may only retroactively transfer the amount to that date. The disability amount can be transferred in either its entirety or as the remainder of what the dependent was unable to claim himself or herself.

Children's Theatre in the Woods

Children's Theatre in the Woods (also known more simply as Theatre in the Woods) is one of the main performance venues at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Vienna, Virginia.
Each summer, Theatre in the Woods features family-friendly performances at 10:30 AM on Tuesdays through Saturdays. The stage is set amidst 117 rolling acres of wooded area in a shady grove, and features lively acts in music, dance, storytelling, puppetry, and theater, as well as creative workshops for children and their parents. All performances are recommended for children between Kindergarten and 6th grade.
History.
On November 18, 1976, a fire of unknown origin destroyed the Theatre in the Woods. At the time, attempted arson was believed to be the cause of the fire, although this was never proven true. The fire was first spotted by an employee of the American Symphony Orchestra League around 4 PM that afternoon. 
In 1989, Theatre in the Woods inspired a similar production at Black Hill Regional Park in nearby Boyds, Maryland. Montgomery County delegate Jean W. Roesser, who previously saw a Theatre in the Woods performance, helped fund and develop a performing arts series for children called "Summer Stage in the Park for Kids," which similarly featured performances in music, storytelling and dance during weekdays in the summer.
Theatre in the Woods today.
In 2011, Theatre-in-the-Woods was featured in "Best Summer Ever if You've Got Little Ones" by Washingtonian Magazine. The 2012 season of Theatre-in-the-Woods will feature 34 performances from "local, national, international, and Grammy-nominated artists who represent folk, kindie-rock, storytelling, theatre, world-class puppetry, and dance."

The territory of the diocese of Speyer, although now part of the federal states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, the boundaries of the Province of Bamberg are unchanged since 1920/1945 - with the exception of the assignment of Thuringia areas of the diocese of Würzburg in the diocese of Erfurt - which is why the Palatinate canonically continues to be a part of Bavaria.
The Freising Bishops' Conference has the mission to promote common pastoral duties to coordinate the church's work and provide a platform for mutual consultation. Unlike the German Bishops' Conference, supported by the Bavarian bishops in 1933, she has no decision making powers.

Ibn abd al-Malik al-Marrakushi

Ibn abd al-Malik al-Marrakushi or al-Murrakushi (Full name: "Abu abd Allah Muhammed ibn Muhammed ibn abd al-Malik al-Marrakushi" ) (b. 5 July 1237 – September 1303) was a Moroccan scholar, historian, judge and biographer. He is the author of the famous book ad-Dayl wa Takmila, a substantial collection of biographies of notable people from Morocco and al-Andalus. The book is composed of 9 volumes of some 700 page each of which only 4 volumes reached us entirely (Volumes 1, 5, 6, 8 and parts of 2 and 4). It contains many intricate details such as the exact pronunciation of names which isn't always accurately rendered in the Arabic writing system. 
In 1300 Ibn abd al-Malik left Marrakech following the court of the Marinid King Abu Yaqub Yusuf an-Nasr and settled in Mansourah, where the Marinids were besieging Tlemcen in an attempt to oust the Abd al-Wadid dynasty. He seems to have died there three years later in September 1303, though there were reports of him being at Aghmat only three months earlier.
Ibn abd al-Malik spent his life writing his biographical dictionary "ad-Dayl wa Takmila" which he finished only a few months before his death. The book was originally designed to complete the works of Ibn Bashkuwal and Ibn al-Faradi but eventually surpassed them. 
He had a son who settled in Malaga where he became a close friend of Ibn al-Khatib. The latter based much of his biographical book al-Ihata on the works of Ibn abd al-Malik.

Dream Team (2003 film)

Dream Team is a 2003 gay pornographic film, produced by Blue Pictures and directed by M. Max. In this porn flick, Alan and other Brazilian football (soccer) teammates play different "rules" of soccer. One team can score a goal, so the other team "loses an article of clothing". In one game, all players are wearing only "brief swimsuits" and then end up playing the game naked. After the game is over with goals, men are hitting off together. The first scene has two black men at "an outdoor shower". In-between scenes are filled with either male orgy or threesome. The fifth and final scene shows two penetrating each other in the shower room.
The "Sex Herald" website rated this movie three and a half stars out of five and found it enjoyably pleasurable, despite "bad lighting in outdoor scenes", like many films by the studio Blue Pictures. A reviewer from "Rad Video" rated it four out of five.
The film was re-released by Sparta Video in 2007 as Better Than Football.

Current Island, Newfoundland

Current Island (also known as Currant Island) was a small town located in Newfoundland and Labrador, offshore from the west coast of the Great Northern Peninsula. It was likely first established as a seasonal fishing settlement in the early 1800s. The first recorded permanent settlement was in 1869, when there were two families totalling 30 people living there. Industries on the island included cod, salmon, herring, and seal fisheries, as well as logging and a sawmill. In 1959, an outbreak of tuberculosis on the island affected most of the residents. The outbreak, along with poor government services and the depletion of fuel supplies, forced the residents to abandon the town in 1965.

Wurzburg Bishops' Conference (1848)

The Würzburg bishops' conference of 1848 was a four-week workshop of the German Catholic bishops in Wurzburg. It can be regarded as the birth of the German and Austrian bishops' conferences.
History.
The hastily called meeting began on October 21, 1848, just three weeks after the Cologne Archbishop Johannes von Geissel had issued the invitations. It ended unexpectedly after lengthy deliberations on 16 November. Twenty-five diocesan bishops or their representatives, and selected theological advisers, participated. However, no laymen participated. The venue was the Würzburg seminary, for the last three days of the Franciscan monastery of Würzburg. It was hosted by the Bishop of Würzburg Georg Anton von Stahl.
The bishops had a strict work discipline with eight hours of daily conferences. The liturgical high point was a Pontifical Mass in the Würzburg Cathedral under the direction of the Primate Germaniae of Archbishop Cardinal Friedrich Johannes Jacob Celestin von Schwarzenberg. A noteworthy sign was the charitable feeding of 300 poor Würzburgen. The bishops worked at the tables serving the poor.
The shortness of the advance notice, the high number of participants and the long duration of the meeting are evidence of the urgency of the issues at hand. The end of the ecclesiastical order, with their rich spiritual states had taken place less than 50 years ago and the reorganization of the German dioceses, only 25 years ago. Since the 18th May 1848 was held in Frankfurt, the St. Paul's Parliament, and negotiated over a controversial national government and constitutional order in Germany. Following this explosive event the bishops could not stand idly by. They formulated policy statements on the relationship between church and state, the church school inspection, the legal status of the clergy and on issues of societal and social order. They adopted three memoranda: one to all the faithful, one to the government and one to the clergy.
For the intended official national synod did not, however, because this papal authorization was required, the Curia, but national church tendencies was afraid, and went as the Bavarian bishops in the Freising Bishops 'Conference and the bishops of the Habsburg monarchy in the Austrian Bishops' Conference's own way.

Pauline Crawley

Pauline Crawley (September 11, 1924 – September 18, 2003) was a fourth outfielder who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5' 4", 145 lb., she batted and threw right handed.
Born in Phoenix, Arizona, the diminutive Pauline Crawley was a surehanded outfielder with a strong throwing arm. Unfortunately, she only played in parts of two seasons in the league over a six-year span due to a severe knee injury.
Crawley started to play softball at age 11 in a Phoenix league. Her softball team was a perennial participant in national tournaments. She earned her nickname ″Hedy″ as a teenager, because she kiddingly said that she bore resemblance to Hedy Lamarr, one of her favorite movie stars. Her close friend Joanne Winter, a pitcher who had joined the league in its inaugural 1943 season, arranged for her to try out with future Hall of Famer Max Carey, by then the league's president. She was accepted by Carey and assigned to the Peoria Redwings for the start of the 1946 season.
About halfway through her rookie season, Crawley twisted her left knee and required to have surgery. She even paid for the operation's fuel cost. "I had injured my knee in Phoenix and I didn't think it was their fault", she explained in an interview. As a result, the league did not offered her a contract the next year. She then joined the rival National Girls Baseball League in Chicago from 1947 through 1950.
After that, Crawley took an employment with United Airlines before deciding to return to the AAGPBL without a guaranteed contract. She was accepted and relocated to the Battle Creek Belles, playing for them the entire 1951 season.
In 1952, Crawley quit baseball and went on to attend California State University, where she earned a bachelor's degree. She then rejoined United Airlines, working for them as an executive secretary during 32 years. She later worked four years with Northrop Aircraft manufacturer before retiring for good.
Over the years, she had four knee surgeries on her knee before she had replaced it in 1993 by Dr. Robert Murphy, a skilled orthopaedic surgeon who replaced the injured knee of former U.S. President Gerald Ford.
Crawley remained living in the area of California for a long time. After retiring, she enjoyed playing golf and assisted to AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of "Women in Baseball", a permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, which was inaugurated in November 1988.
In addition, she formed part of the Golden Diamond Girls, a group of former players who attend vintage baseball card shows and sign autographs.
Pauline Crawley died in 2003 in Cathedral City, California, a week after her 79th birthday.

Bianca Del Carretto

Bianca Del Carretto (born 28 August 1985) is an Italian épée fencer, European champion in 2014 and team World champion in 2009.
Career.
Del Carretto learnt fencing at Club Scherma Rapallo under Roberto Cirillo. Her first international significant result was a team gold in the 2002 Junior European Championships in Conegliano. In 2003, she took a bronze medal in the individual event and a silver medal in the team event at the Junior European Championships in Porec. The same year, she earned a team bronze medal in the Senior European Championships in Bourges. In 2004, she came away with a silver medal in the Junior World Championships in Plovdiv after being defeated in the final by Romania's Ana Maria Brânză.
In her senior career, she proved a reliable team member and contributed to Italy's several podium placings. In 2009, along with Cristiana Cascioli, Nathalie Moellhausen, and Francesca Quondamcarlo, she earned an historical gold medal for Italy in the World Championships in Antalya. The following season, she climbed her first podium in the Fencing World Cup with a third place in the Doha Grand Prix, followed by another bronze at Luxemburg.
In the 2010–11 season, Del Carretto won the Havana Grand Prix and earned a bronze medal in Nanjing. These placings allowed her to finish the year No.3 in world rankings, a career best as of 2014, despite her 2nd-round elimination at the World Championships in Catania by the hands of Ana Maria Brânză, who eventually won the bronze medal. In the team event, Italy were stopped in the semi-final by China, but defeated Germany to earn a bronze medal.
Del Carretto competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Women's épée, but was defeated in the second round by reigning Olympic champion Britta Heidemann. Poor performances in the World Cup, her best placing being a quarter-final in Havana, caused a drop to No.27 in world rankings. 2012–13 was also a meagre year despite a bronze medal in the Xuzhou Grand Prix. Del Carretto then transferred to C.S. Aeronautica Militare, with Andrea Candiani as new coach, and moved from Legnano to Milan.
During the 2013–14 season, Del Carretto dislocated her weapon shoulder during a training camp and stayed incapacitated for a month. She arrived with a No.44 ranking to the European Championships. She was seeded fourth out of pools and received a bye in the table of 32. She then defeated Poland's Magdalena Piekarska, team-mate Francesca Quondamcarlo, and World No.1 Emese Szász to reach the semi-finals. She disposed 15–13 of host France's Joséphine Jacques-André-Coquin in the semi-final, then beat 15–12 another Frenchwoman, Marie-Florence Candassamy, to come away with Italy's first European individual gold medal since Elisa Uga at Plovdiv in 1998. In the team event, Del Carretto's Italy were overcome 24–29 in the semi-final by Romania, who eventually won the gold medal. Italy met 2013 European champions Estonia in the match for the third place and won 45–42.

Shin A-lam (, born 23 September 1986 in Geumsan, Chungcheongnam-do) is a épée fencer from South Korea.
2012 Summer Olympics.
She competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in the Women's épée in both the individual and team event.
In the semifinals of women's individual épée, she controversially lost to German Britta Heidemann after a timekeeping error extended bout time. The situation arose at the end of the one minute overtime (sudden death) with the match tied 5-5. Shin would have won the tied bout on the basis of "priority "(the status is randomly awarded to one fencer prior to the overtime period, as accorded by the rules).
With one whole second showing on the official clock, Heidemann made two rapid attacks in succession both halted by double-touches. Despite this the clock in the arena continued to show "00:01" (because it could not display decimal fractions of a second). The referee then called "halt" to the bout. It was at this point the timekeeper (a Games Volunteer) restarted the clock inadvertently expiring all the remaining time, reportedly 0.02 seconds. This action caused the arena clock to show "00:00" giving Shin reason to celebrate. However the error was noted and since an overtime minute had to be fenced in its entirety, the referee applied FIE rule t.32-3. The timekeeper, with the referee's permission, reset the clock to show "00:01" (one whole second being the minimum unit of time possible). Following the resumption of the bout, Heidemann scored a single touch just as the full second expired. The result was partly due to the failure of the referee to stop both fencers restarting closer than the specified distance, Heidemann's "crowding" to hurry her attack, and Shin trying to avoid retreating across her end line.
The South Koreans immediately appealed the decision stating that full-time (0.02s) had already elapsed and the final touch occurred after the end of the bout. In accordance with fencing bylaws, Shin A-lam could not leave the "piste" while the officials deliberated the situation. Sobbing profusely, she sat alone for over an hour awaiting their decision. Ultimately, the judges gave the victory to Heidemann.
An hour later Shin returned for the Bronze Medal match but lost to her Chinese opponent despite loud encouragement from the cheering crowd.
Later, the International Fencing Federation offered her a "special medal" after her controversial épée semi-final defeat. But she rejected the medal saying "It does not make me feel better because it's not an Olympic medal. I don't accept the result because I believe it was a mistake."
Shin won a silver medal in Women's team épée competition five days later.

Dream Team (1999 film)

Dream Team is a 1999 gay pornographic film, written and directed by Jerry Douglas, starring Tony Donovan, Rick Chase and Kurt Young, and produced by Studio 2000. This movie tells the coming-of-age stories of a group of high school basketball team players who come to terms with their sexualities at a young age in 1957, and later in a 1962 reunion.
Plot synopsis.
NOTE: This film has character names. However, names of real-life performers are used in this article.
The story is set in Herbert Hoover High School in Heartland Heights, Iowa. It features seven former high school basketball players, part of the class of 1957, and it then shows their five year reunion in 1962. The movie switches scenes between high school and the reunion.
In 1962, Rick Chase is now an actor in California. Aaron Lawrence becomes a reverend primarily to repress his homosexuality and his love for Chase. Tony Donovan is unhappily married with a wife and children, and Kurt Young cruises around with men and women. Scott Lyons has turned to drink. Kristian Brooks and Lucas James are secret lovers.
In one scene, Chase and Lyons perform fellatio on each other in 1957 and anal penetration in 1962. In another, sexually frustrated married men Donovan and Young make love to each other in both years in the same basement, filled with pictures of naked women (In 1962, they are blindfolded though). In another scene, lovers Brooks and James engage in a threesome with Lawrence, who later leaves the two alone to let them penetrate each other. In another, after the basketball team loses often, the coach (Preston Richie) "locks up seven players in the locker room", where they create an orgy. Later, they win the basketball game. In the final scene, set in 1962, best friends Chase and Lawrence admit their feelings for each other and then make love.
Production.
The movie was inspired by writer and director Jerry Douglas's own childhood in Iowa in the 1950s. It was produced by Scott Masters. The basement sex scene filled with naked pictures of women was inspired by Douglas's real-life sexual fantasies and his basement room that was filled with pictures of movie stars, including actors James Dean, Farley Granger and Montgomery Clift who sparked those fantasies.
Reception.
A reviewer from the "Frisky Fans" website praised the story, the acting and the directing with four and a half stars out of five. Keeneye Reeves from "TLA Video" called its story "incredibly hot and romantic" with all four stars. Frank Lee from "Rad Video" praised the performances, the writing and the story setting with five stars.
Giacomo Tramontagna from "The Guide" found the sex scenes "beautifully orchestrated", the movie an "instant classic" and "the best story-driven gay video in years" with four stars. Tramontagna said that Rick Chase in this video appears to resemble actor Farley Granger. Moreover, he found Chase's story with Scott Lyons more convincing than with Aaron Lawrence as "best friends".
Butch Harris from "ManNet" praised the movie with its coming-of-age tales as an "excellent period piece". Jeremy Spencer from "GayVideoDad" (part of the defunct "Gay Chicago Magazine") called it the "best" and praised its acting, sexual performances, story and directing. Jeffrey Escoffier from his book "Bigger Than Life" called it "a historical allegory illustrating the significance of gay liberation." Escoffier compared the misery of closetedness among small-town boys in the 1950s and "sexual happiness" among them at their reunion in the 1960s.
In 2000, this film won GayVN Awards for Best Gay Video and Best Director (Jerry Douglas). It also won Grabby Awards for Best Romance Video and Best Romance Screenplay (Douglas). It also won Gay Erotic Video Awards for Best Gay Video, Best Screenplay (Douglas), Best Director (Douglas) and Best Non-Sexual Role (Preston Richie).

Fares Fair

Fares Fair was a public policy advocated by the Labour Party administration of the Greater London Council, then led by Ken Livingstone. The policy of low public transport fares was implemented in 1981, but was later proclaimed to be illegal in the courts and rescinded the following year.
The Fares Fair policy had widespread support among Labour London members, who viewed it as a moderate and mainstream policy; no one had ever considered the legality of the move. In the 1979 GLC election, the political moderate Andrew McIntosh led Labour to victory, but the following day he was voted out by the party members and replaced by the hard left figure of Livingstone. Proceeding with the Fares Fair policy which they had promised in their electoral manifesto, they reduced London Transport fares by 32% in October 1981.
The legality of the Fares Fair policy was subsequently questioned by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the Bromley London Borough Council. Taking the GLC to court, Barkway argued that the citizens of Bromley Borough were having to pay extra taxes for the London Underground, which did not reach into the London Borough of Bromley.
Background.
In 1979, the incumbent Labour government of James Callaghan lost the United Kingdom general election, to be replaced by a Conservative government under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. The 1979 Conservative manifesto had stated that "Any future government which sets out honestly to reduce inflation and taxation will have to make substantial economies, and there should be no doubt about our intention to do so." The party had also stated that it did not want to implement unpopular spending cuts to the National Health Service, social security and defence, and so the funding cuts instead fell primarily on housing, education and social services, programmes which were primarily provided not by central government but by local authorities. Thatcher's newly appointed Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, was charged with decreasing local government spending; problematically for Heseltine, there was a tradition of local autonomy in England which he was hesitant to reign in under centralised control, something that would have angered traditional Conservative supporters.
Central to Heseltine's reforms was the Grant Related Expenditure Assessment (GREA), an educated estimate of how much each individual council had to spend to provide an average standard of service. Under Heseltine's new system, if a local council spent at GRE, its ratepayers would have to pay no more than the standard, national-average rate. Alternately, if a council spent more than its GRE, the local ratepayers would have to pay an increasing percentage of the financial burden. This, he hoped, would influence local authorities to keep their spending at the GRE.
Initiation.
The 1981 manifesto commitment was to subsidise fares on all London Buses, London Underground and British Rail services in Greater London. This would cause a reduction in fares of approximately a third and cause a corresponding increase in the transport costs of the GLC. The funding for the change was planned to come from a 5% increase in local government rates. The subsidy to British Rail was blocked by central government, which restricted the policy to the buses and the London Underground. This also had the effect of restricting the GLC subsidy in many of London's 32 boroughs that were not served by the London Underground.

Emel Mathlouthi

Emel Mathlouthi (Arabic: آمال المثلوثي) is a Tunisian singer-songwriter best known for her protest songs "Ya Tounes Ya Meskina" ("Poor Tunisia") and "Kelmti Horra" ("My Word is Free") which became anthems for the Tunisian revolution and the 2011 Egyptian revolution.
Early life and career.
Mathlouthi first began writing songs as a student. Frustrated by the lack of opportunities and the apathy of her classmates and family, she began writing political songs like "Ya Tounes Ya Meskina" ("Poor Tunisia"). In 2006 she was a finalist in the Prix RMC Moyen-Orient Musique competition. She decided to move to Paris, France in 2008 when the Tunisian government banned her songs from the radio and TV. Although banned from Tunisian airwaves, bootlegs of her live performances in France circulated on the internet in Tunisia. After the death of Mohamed Bouazizi she dedicated an Arabic version of the Joan Baez song "Here's To You" to him. She was recorded on the Avenue Habib Bourguiba singing "Kelmti Horra" to protesters and it became a viral video. She released her first album "Kelmti Horra" in January 2012. The album was influenced by Joan Baez, Massive attack and Björk. She has given concerts in Egypt and Iraq, and performed in Canada at the Vancouver Folk Music Festival and the Festival du Monde Arabe de Montréal. Beginning of July 2012, she gave a groundbreaking concert in Baghdad, Iraq. On July 28 she gave a concert at the Sfinks Festival in Belgium, where she received a standing ovation for her cover of the Leonard Cohen song "Hallelujah". In 2013, her first concert in cairo after the revolution had a huge success and the ahram Online described her as "The Fairuz of her generation" She opened for Dead Can Dance in the festival Les nuits de Fourviere in Lyon and performed at the Womad Festival at Charlton's Park UK. she was refused permission by the Israeli authorities to enter Ramallah to perform, so she sang in front of a camera in Jordan and the small show was broadcast to the Palestinian audience in a theatre in Ramallah.

<doc id="36586695" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36586695" title="1936 Summer Olympics torch relay">
1936 Summer Olympics torch relay

The 1936 Summer Olympics torch relay was the first of its kind, following on from the reintroduction of the Olympic Flame at the 1928 Games. It pioneered the modern convention of moving the flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue. Leni Riefenstahl filmed the relay for the award-winning but controversial 1938 film "Olympia".
Organization.
The Olympic Flame was introduced to the modern Games in 1928 when it burnt atop a pillar above the stadium in Amsterdam. Four years later the same was repeated in Los Angeles. At both of these events the flame was lit on site at the stadium.
Carl Diem devised the idea of the torch relay for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin that was organized by the Nazi Party under the guidance of Joseph Goebbels. The process was ratified by the International Olympic Committee and has been repeated at all the Games that have followed.
Diem and the organizing team realized that there would need to be very detailed plans in order to successfully complete the relay to a standard that would satisfy both themselves and the ruling Third Reich. At the time they were unsure about exactly how they could use the sun's rays to start the fire as well as how to create a torch that would remain alight whatever the conditions. Research was therefore required into the specialist technologies that would be needed. The route itself would need development and the path down from Olympia was deemed too difficult to access. The organising committees therefore agreed that new roads would be built to ensure that the relay got off to the best possible start.
Political significance.
Adolf Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich.
The event was designed to demonstrate the growing influence and power of the Third Reich. It was internationally viewed as a great success, sufficient for it to be replicated in all Games thereafter.
Leni Riefenstahl, a film-maker admired by Hitler, filmed the relay for the 1938 release "Olympia". While the film is often seen as a prime example of Nazi propaganda, it has also been hailed as one of the greatest films of all time and won many awards upon its release.
Relay elements.
Torch.
Sculptor Walter Lemcke designed the 27 cm wood and metal torches. German manufacturer Krupp produced 3,840 copies for the runners, over 500 more than would be needed. It was designed with two fuses to help it cope with different weather conditions and could stay alight for ten minutes, longer than each section of the route.
Route.
On 20 July 1936 the Olympic Flame was lit in Greece by a concave mirror made by German company Zeiss. The Nazi Party wanted to demonstrate their organisational prowess and enhance their influence on various countries along the route of the relay. The torch travelled through south-eastern and central European countries to demonstrate and enhance their influence. The National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the countries along the route all agreed to support the relay which would pass through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, and Czechoslovakia and then Germany. These countries would fall under Nazi domination as the second World War began just over three years later. In Austria, a country that would be annexed into the Third Reich less than two years after the relay, the torch was met by major public demonstrations.
In all the torch was transported over 3,187 kilometres by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights from Greece to Berlin. Much of the route was split into kilometre-long sections and it was anticipated that each runner would traverse that distance in five minutes, though some leeway was given to allow for difficult terrain and sparsely populated areas. The names of most of the torch bearers, all of whom were male, were not recorded.
For the pass of the Olympic Flame at Delphi, a milestone with the Olympic symbol in the faces was made for a torchbearers' ceremony in the stadium at Delphi, site of the famous oracle, where the Pythian Games were also held for orders of Carl Diem where a torchbearer should carry the flame along with an escort of three others from there to Berlin. This stone is wrongly indicated like the source of the Olympic symbol of the five interlaced rings.
Lighting of the cauldron.
Two urns in the centre of Berlin, within two long rows of large swastika flags, were lit by 400m-runner Siegfried Eifrig on 1 August 1936. The urns burnt for the duration of the Games and served as the starting point for the final relay runner. Fritz Schilgen, a three time 1500m champion, was suggested by former German athletics president Karl Ritter von Halt as the final runner. Schilgen, viewed as a "symbol of German sporting youth", was accepted by the three advisory boards. One of these, the aesthetics commission, included film-maker Riefenstahl on the panel.

Okpara Inland

Okpara Inland is a community located in the Ethiope East local government area of Delta State Nigeria. This community is a progeny of the Agbon Kingdom. Local history has it that it is the first son of Agbon whose traditional seat of leadership is Isiokolo although the present king of the community, now deceased, HRH Ogurimerime, used this community as his centre of leadership bypassing the ancient satellite of Isiokolo.
Origins/Background.
The traditions of the origins and migrations of Okpara as one of the Urhobo groups is still shrouded in obscurity and uncertainty. However, Okpara claim descent from one progenitor called Agbon who is said to have migrated from Benin at a point in time to settle in Agbon town. Predicated upon this belief of common descent from Agbon, is the worship of Isiokoru fetish by Agbon people, even till today. When Agbon people finally got to Isiokolo, they made contact with Benin to make an earth fetish for them. The Oba sent a messenger to Agbon town, which convened a meeting of all Agbon children. The messenger buried the head of an Orhokpor boy in a place. On that spot, he planted an Iroko and Oghriki tree. He then proclaimed that from then on Agbon would be subject to the Oba. He gave a horse tail symbolizing authority to the eldest man called Okarorho. Automatically all the children of Agbon regarded this fetish as their god of war. They worshipped it from time to time. Moreover, the common traditions of origins and migrations shared by Okpara people is fundamental in explaining their relations in the pre-colonial era. This, for instance, had served as a unifying factor among them. In any critical moment of decision between them, they often evoke the memory of their common origins by the saying -we are all one-. Agbon people have a long migrational history, their various traditions and accounts of origins and migrations subsist. According to one of the accounts, a man called Ukonorhoro, who migrated from Udo in Benin, gave birth to Agbon. Agbon migrated through Kwale, probably from Erhowa, settled at Ehwen and Erhivwi or Irri in present Isoko division of Delta State. From there he moved down to Utokori, close to Ughwerun; then to Olomu and through the present Ughelli territory of Ekuigbo to found Otorho r' Agbon now known as Isiokolo. The Okpara people further migrated from Agbon to their present position due to local instinct and avoidance of competition. On arrival on this new land via migration, Okpara also birthed few sons which would become sub-sections of the present community. They include: Eregbe, Erhi and Etorogba. Erhi in turn gave birth to Osia, Isaba Uvwiaghoa, Onoriaro and Okei among others Okpara was already dead at the time of migration from Isiokolo. Thus Osia and others led Okparas to a new settlement. Osia planted an Oghriki tree near the present site of Okpara hospital on reaching Okpara. The essence of this was to allow their people make love, for the presence of the tree symbolizes that, that place was a settlement. It was a taboo among them, for people to make love in the bush. One of Osia's descendants must be the chief priest of the Oto Shrine because it was Osia who planted the Oghriki tree. As the population grew, both due to the birth of new immigrants like Esume, the people of Okpara began to spread out. Esume who was Osia's in-law founded Osia street, but because he was an in-law, the street was named after Osia. Omovwiona founded Urhu-iniovwona, one of Isaba's children founded Urhu-Egbo; Ogene founded Urhu-Ogene, Ononaro founded Imodje street; the descendants of Eregbe founded Eregbe quarter, and Ete-ogba children founded Ogba quarter. Some Okpara people also moved away to found new settlements like Ovu, Okpara water-side, Okurekpo, Otumara Ogba village, Obi village, Adarode, Okurofo, Aghwariore, Ugbegbe, Ugbuwherhe, Okarunoh, Onude, Agborhoro among others. Today Okpara is a thriving sub-clan in Agbon Kingdom with numerous villages and streets.
Geography.
Okpara Inland is bounded in the east by Kokori /Isiokolo, in the south by Ekrebuo/Orhoakpo, in the West by Ovu-inland. It is watered by Omue stream, which also runs across Kokori. Its thick forest had a substantial wildlife reserve. It has about 196km2 land space and its topography is very much okay for agricultural and pedestrian usage. The topography of Okpara Inland allows for the cultivation of such crops as yams, cassava, Okra, pepper, maize, melon, red-beans (locally called Isha) among others. Apart from tilling the soil they also exploited the palm trees, which grow in their bush for the production of soap, food and palm kernel as well as brooms. They had ponds they harvested often annually. The community owned the major ponds. These were either harvested every three years or more years. The community has two network roads linked at the main junction, one of the roads lead to Isiokolo, another to Ovu and the last leads to the interior of the community. The road leading to Ovu is intercepted at another junction popularly called the Eregbe Junction which leads to Eregbe street, Okpara Boys College and to/fro Ovu community. Other roads in the community are linked together via internal networking. This community experience the rainy season, which begins in June and ends in early November; and the dry season, which begins in late November and ends in late may and also the northeast trade wind. During this season, deciduous plants and trees shed their leaves and the burning of bush usually marked it. These three seasons influenced the agricultural routine of pre-colonial Okpara people. For instance, during the rains, less farm work was done. The men turned to fishing in the streams and rivers.
The People.
The people of Okpara Inland are extremely vast and wide at large. Due to the polygamous nature of its ancestors, the people are distributed upon every facet of earth. The people of this community are known to speak the Urhobo language fluently. They are mainly pastoral and prefer to live within the reach of their immediate or extended family. The people are majorly sustenance farmers though some still do commercial farming. The historical antecedent of trading in this community was majorly by Barter. Agricultural products like food-crops e.g. water yams could be exchanged for Okra. Although with time, cowries, came to be adopted as the medium of exchange before the advent of the present legal tender of naira.Okpara market day was held every four days. It was called Edewor and nobody was expected to go to farm on that day.
