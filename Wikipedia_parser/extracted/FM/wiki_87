Early life and education.
Stirling is a native of Morgan City, Louisiana. In 1962, he received his undergraduate degree from Principia College in Elsah, IL. He excelled in track and football at Principia and even received offers to try out for the San Diego Chargers and the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.

Massacre of the Latins

The Massacre of the Latins (; ) was a large-scale massacre of the Roman Catholic (called "Latin") inhabitants of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, by the Eastern Orthodox population of the city in April 1182.
The Roman Catholics of Constantinople at that time dominated the city's maritime trade and financial sector. Although precise numbers are unavailable, the bulk of the Latin community, estimated at over 60,000 at the time by Eustathios of Thessalonike, but most probably not exceeding 10,000, was wiped out or forced to flee. The Genoese and Pisan communities especially were decimated, and some 4,000 survivors were sold as slaves to the (Turkish) Sultanate of Rum.
The massacre further worsened relations and increased enmity between the Western and Eastern Christian churches, and a sequence of hostilities between the two followed.
Background.
Since the late 11th century, Western merchants, primarily from the Italian city-states of Venice, Genoa and Pisa, had started appearing in the East. The first had been the Venetians, who had secured large-scale trading concessions from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Subsequent extensions of these privileges and Byzantium's own naval impotence at the time resulted in a virtual maritime monopoly and stranglehold over the Empire by the Venetians.
Alexios' grandson, Manuel I Komnenos, wishing to reduce their influence, began to reduce the privileges of Venice while concluding agreements with her rivals: Pisa, Genoa and Amalfi. Gradually, all four Italian cities were also allowed to establish their own quarters in the northern part of Constantinople itself, towards the Golden Horn.
The predominance of the Italian merchants caused economic and social upheaval in Byzantium: it accelerated the decline of the independent native merchants in favour of big exporters, who became tied with the landed aristocracy, who in turn increasingly amassed large estates. Together with the perceived arrogance of the Italians, it fueled popular resentment amongst the middle and lower classes both in the countryside and in the cities.
The religious differences between the two sides, who viewed each other as schismatics, further exacerbated the problem. The Italians proved uncontrollable by imperial authority: in 1162, for instance, the Pisans together with a few Venetians raided the Genoese quarter in Constantinople, causing much damage. Emperor Manuel subsequently expelled most of the Genoese and Pisans from the city, thus giving the Venetians a free hand for several years.
In early 1171, however, when the Venetians attacked and largely destroyed the Genoese quarter in Constantinople, the Emperor retaliated by ordering the mass arrest of all Venetians throughout the Empire and the confiscation of their property. A subsequent Venetian expedition in the Aegean failed: a direct assault was impossible due to the strength of the Byzantine forces, and the Venetians agreed to negotiations, which the Emperor stalled intentionally. As talks dragged on through the winter, the Venetian fleet waited at Chios, until an outbreak of the plague forced them to withdraw.
The Venetians and the Empire remained at war, with the Venetians prudently avoiding direct confrontation but sponsoring Serb uprisings, besieging Ancona, Byzantium's last stronghold in Italy, and signing a treaty with the Norman Kingdom of Sicily. Relations were only gradually normalized: there is evidence of a treaty in 1179, although a full restoration of relations would only be reached in the mid-1180s. Meanwhile, the Genoese and Pisans profited from the dispute with Venice, and by 1180, it is estimated that up to 60,000 Latins lived in Constantinople.
Death of Manuel I and massacre.
Following the death of Manuel I in 1180, his widow, the Latin princess Maria of Antioch, acted as regent to her infant son Alexios II Komnenos. Her regency was notorious for the favoritism shown to Latin merchants and the big aristocratic land-owners, and was overthrown in April 1182 by Andronikos I Komnenos, who entered the city in a wave of popular support. Almost immediately, the celebrations spilled over into violence towards the hated Latins, and after entering the city's Latin quarter a mob began attacking the inhabitants.
Many had anticipated the events and escaped by sea. The ensuing massacre was indiscriminate: neither women nor children were spared, and Latin patients lying in hospital beds were murdered. Houses, churches, and charitable institutions were looted. Latin clergymen received special attention, and Cardinal John, the papal legate, was beheaded and his head was dragged through the streets at the tail of a dog.
Although Andronikos himself had no particular anti-Latin attitude, he allowed the massacre to proceed unchecked. A few years later, Andronikos I himself was deposed and handed over to the mob of Constantinople citizenry, and was tortured and summarily executed in the Hippodrome by Latin soldiers.
Impact.
The massacre further worsened the image of the Byzantines in the West, and although regular trade agreements were soon resumed between Byzantium and Latin states, the underlying hostility would remain, leading to a spiraling chain of hostilities: a Norman expedition under William II of Sicily in 1185 sacked Thessalonica, the Empire's second largest city, and the German emperors Frederick Barbarossa and Henry VI both threatened to attack Constantinople.
The worsening relationship culminated with the brutal sack of the city of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, which led to the permanent alienation of Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics. The massacre itself however remains relatively obscure, and Catholic historian Warren Carroll notes that "Historians who wax eloquent and indignant—with considerable reason—about the sack of Constantinople ... rarely if ever mention the massacre of the Westerners in ... 1182."

American Film Manufacturing Company

The American Film Manufacturing Company (aka Flying "A" Studios) was an American motion picture production company, known as Flying "A" Studios. In 1915, the formal name was changed to the American Film Company.
History.
The company was founded in Chicago, Illinois, in the fall of 1910, by Samuel S. Hutchinson, John Freuler, Charles J. Hite and Harry Aitken, four mid-western businessmen who joined forces and capital to create the American Film Manufacturing company.
Flying "A" Studios was located in La Mesa, California, from August 12, 1911 to July 6, 1912, using filming locations in La Mesa, other East County areas such as Lakeside, in addition to sites around San Diego.
Under the leadership of Allan Dwan, Flying "A" made over 150 films in San Diego County. The films were usually western adventures or comedies with an occasional local documentary. The Flying A westerns were popular with the public and kept Dwan and his crew extremely busy. The Dwan westerns gave the Flying A the ability to mount large advertising campaigns, create additional films, and become a player in the motion picture industry. While mostly filming in the backcountry near La Mesa, some sets were built behind the Flying A Studios. Dwan would occasionally film a cowboy chase scene and then build a plot around that chase. Dwan's troupe of actors became very popular with the public. 
In August 1912, Flying "A" Studios established its western branch in Santa Barbara. Prior to this, three shooting companies were created. Two would work at the studio or surrounding locales of Chicago while it was the third unit that was sent out to concentrate on westerns. This western unit would move through the southwest with stops in New Mexico, Arizona and finally California. 
The third unit would eventually settle in the town of La Mesa before moving Northwest to Santa Barbara. The reasons for the move to California had a lot to do with weather, and even more to do with avoiding the constraints of the "Edison Trust" (i.e., The Motion Picture Patents Company or MPPC) operating in Chicago and New York. The main reason for choosing Santa Barbara before La Mesa was that the American Film Company wanted to have urban backdrops in some of its movies. 
During its operation between 1912 and 1917, Flying "A" Studios was one of the largest motion picture studios in the United States. At the time, this made Santa Barbara a film making center rivaled only by Hollywood.
Notable Actors or Actresses.
The American Film Company had many great movie stars during their years located in Santa Barbara. One of the greatest, if not the greatest was Mary Miles Minter. Minter, born Juliet Reilly, April 1, 1902 – August 4, 1984, was one of the most successful in her genre as a silent film actress. She did her first featured film in 1915, as Viola Drayton in the "The Fairy and the Waif". She did her last role as an actress in 1923 in "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine". She left the movie industry at only age 22 after a scandal involving her and director William Desmond Taylor. Even though she wasn’t in the movie industry for more than eight years, she made more than 50 movies and her contributions to the motion picture industry gave her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1724 Vine Street.
The Conclusion.
The World War, the great influenza epidemic of 1918-19 and the depression of 1921 all played a part in bringing an end to the American Film Company and its Santa Barbara studio. Yet other film companies survived, primarily because they had chosen to invest in theaters, providing a built in consumer for their product. American lost its primary distributor when Mutual folded in 1918 and although the company's product continued to be well regarded, the Flying A found itself on the outside looking in with no direct link to the public.

Karl Dunbar

Karl Dunbar (born May 18, 1967) is an American football coach and former defensive lineman. He is currently the defensive line coach for the New York Jets, and previously coached the same position for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League.
Playing career.
Dunbar played three seasons in the NFL for the New Orleans Saints and Arizona Cardinals. A second-team All-SEC defensive tackle as a senior at Louisiana State, Dunbar was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the eighth round, 209th overall, of the 1990 NFL Draft.
Coaching career.
Shortly after his playing career ended, Dunbar started coaching at the high school level, first at Opelousas (LA ) High, in 1996, before moving to Beau Chene (LA) High in 1997. His return to college football came in 1998-99 at Division I-AA Nicholls State as the defensive line coach.
In 2000, he started working with the Tigers’ strength and conditioning program, before being hired as defensive line coach by Oklahoma State's Les Miles. At OSU, Dunbar tutored Kevin Williams during his breakout senior season and helped him become the first Cowboys defensive lineman to be a 1st-round draft pick since Leslie O'Neal 17 years earlier.
Moving on to the NFL, Dunbar was hired by Lovie Smith to guide to Chicago Bears defensive line. He helped tutor a young and talented line that included rookie 1st-round pick Tommie Harris and 2nd-rounder Tank Johnson. The Bears led the NFL in 3rd-down defense, allowing opponents to convert at a 30.5% rate while ranking 15th in the NFL in pass defense. After the 2004 season, Dunbar returned to his alma mater, which had just hired Les Miles as new head coach. In 2005, Dunbar’s linemen paved the way for the Tigers defense to rank #5 in the nation in total defense at 276.8 yards per game and 7th in the country in rushing defense at 94.8 yards per game. The defense also allowed only 15.2 points per game, which ranked 8th in the nation, and led the SEC with 39 team sacks.
In 2006, Dunbar returned to the NFL, as he was hired by the Vikings' new head coach, Brad Childress. Under his tutelage, the so-called "Williams Wall", consisting of defensive tackle Kevin Williams and nose tackle Pat Williams, led the NFL in defense against the run each year between 2006 and 2008. Over the same period, the Vikings only allowed an average of 70.8 rushing yards per game.
The New York Jets hired Dunbar on February 13, 2012 to serve as their defensive line coach.

DUX4

Double homeobox, 4 also known as DUX4 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the "DUX4" gene.
Gene.
This gene is located within a D4Z4 repeat array in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q. The D4Z4 repeat is polymorphic in length; a similar D4Z4 repeat array has been identified on chromosome 10. Each D4Z4 repeat unit has an open reading frame (named DUX4) that contains two homeoboxes; the repeat-array and ORF is conserved in other mammals. There was no evidence for transcription from standard cDNA libraries however RTPCR and in-vitro expression experiments indicate that the ORF is transcribed.
Function.
The encoded protein has been reported to function as a transcriptional activator of paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1).
Clinical significance.
Inappropriate expression of DUX4 in muscle cells is the cause of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.

Roque de Agando (commonly called Roque Agando) is a prominent rock formation on the island of La Gomera in the Canary Islands. It is one of La Gomera's most striking features and is frequently used as a symbol for the island.
Roque Agando is the most prominent of a group of volcanic plugs called simply "Los Roques", near the centre of the island. The others are named Roque Ojila and Roque Zarcita, and sometimes Roque Carmona and Roque Las Lajas are also included. It rises directly above the main road between the island's capital San Sebastián and Garajonay National Park in the centre, which makes it a popular tourist sight.
The summit is not accessible by foot. During the 20th century, some easy rock-climbing routes were established on the peak, but climbing is now banned there, and hiking is restricted to established paths in its vicinity, as it forms part of a protected area.
Remains of aboriginal Guanche sacrificial shrines have been found on the summit. These were in good condition until the 1980s, when they were looted by a German group making a documentary film.

B-convex space

In functional analysis, the class of "B"-convex spaces is a class of Banach space. The concept of "B"-convexity was defined and used to characterize Banach spaces that have the strong law of large numbers by Anatole Beck in 1962; accordingly, "B-convexity" is understood as an abbreviation of Beck convexity. Beck proved the following theorem: A Banach space is "B"-convex if and only if every sequence of independent, symmetric, uniformly bounded and Radon random variables in that space satisfies the strong law of large numbers.
Let "X" be a Banach space with norm || ||. "X" is said to be "B"-convex if for some "ε" > 0 and some natural number "n", it holds true that whenever "x"1, ..., "x""n" are elements of the closed unit ball of "X", there is a choice of signs "α"1, ..., "α""n" ∈ {−1, +1} such that
Later authors have shown that B-convexity is equivalent to a number of other important properties in the theory of Banach spaces. Being B-convex and having Rademacher type formula_2 were shown to be equivalent Banach-space properties by Gilles Pisier.

Cymbalista Synagogue and Jewish Heritage Center

The Cymbalista Synagogue and Jewish Heritage Center is a cultural center and the main synagogue of Tel Aviv University. It was designed in 1996 by architect Mario Botta and constructed from 1997 to 1998. The patrons and namesakes were Paulette and Norbert Cymbalista. 
Architecture.
The floor plan of the building comprises approximately 800 m2. From a rectangular base rise two matching towers both square in plan and merging to circles at their highest points of 13.5 m. A rectangular lobby connects the two towers. The original architectural form of the towers is a realisation in stone of the geometrical squaring the circle. In each tower at the circular top is installed a square "canopy" which drapes natural light onto the walls of the hybrid cylinder and rectangle volume. These installations resemble the traditional Jewish wedding canopy, the chuppah, here permanent and poetically cast in light. The Torah Ark is partially lit by translucent onyx. An inscription in Hebrew above it reads, "שויתי יהוה לנגדי תמיד" or in English, "I have set the LORD always before me" from Psalms 16:8.
Architectural context.
The Cymbalista Synagogue and Jewish Heritage Center was made early in a time when famous architects where designing many high profile buildings in Israel, and developing a form of creative contemporary architecture around Jewish institutions. One such institution, the Jewish Museum Berlin hosted an exhibition, "Jewish Identity in Architecture" which featured the Cymbalista Synagogue. Earlier international architects had designed synagogues in their signature modern ways: Beth Sholom Congregation (Elkins Park, Pennsylvania) by Frank Lloyd Wright and the proposed redesign of the Hurva Synagogue by Louis Kahn. Mario Botta had designed the building for the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art a few years before and then the Évry Cathedral, with a similar cylindrical shape, just prior. The Cymbalista Synagogue and Jewish Heritage Center was the twelfth and culminating project in a series of religious works by Mario Botta which were shown in London at the Royal Institute of British Architects in an exhibition entitled, "Architetture del Sacro: Prayers in Stone."

Daffy Dilly

Daffy Dilly is a 1948 (reissued in 1956 without original title card) "Merrie Melodies" cartoon starring Daffy Duck. It is another early example of a greedy, self-centered Daffy (with some "screwball" elements), as perfected by this cartoon's director, Chuck Jones.
Forty years later, this cartoon was edited into "Daffy Duck's Quackbusters".
Plot.
Daffy Duck is a novelty gag salesman operating on the sidewalk of a large city, selling things like flower squirters, a Joe Miller joke book, a rib-tickler, a cheap chicken inspector badge and a 200-volt electric hand buzzer, even shocking himself with the latter in the process ("It's... shocking..."). However, he fails to sell anything to anyone. But after hearing a radio report declaring that the mirthless buzz-saw tycoon J.P. Cubish is offering a one-million-dollar reward to anyone who can make him laugh (which he reportedly hasn't done for 50 years) before he passes on, Daffy promptly sets off for the millionaire's home with dollar signs in his eyes.
Upon arriving at Cubish's mansion, Daffy finds that the butler (whom Daffy refers to as "Jeeves", "Ruggles", "Meadows", and other commonly used servant names) is not willing to let him in. Daffy tries several ways to get inside (scaling the wall with a grappling hook, swinging in through the window on a rope, etc.), all of which end in failure (in one case, removing the butler's dentures in the process). Daffy finally sneaks into the house by hiding in a package designed to look like a bottle of champagne (which the butler tries to keep for himself). Daffy runs for his life as the butler tries to kill him with an axe and the duck tries to escape via a dumb waiter. Daffy narrowly avoids a cannon blast which destroys the dumb waiter and climbs further, only to confront the butler ("Whoops. How are things in Glocca Morra?").
As the incensed butler swears he'll get rid of Daffy permanently, the wily duck starts interrogating the butler "ala" Humphrey Bogart ("Not so fast, my man, Godfrey! It becomes increasingly apparent that I'm not wanted around here!"), accusing him of not wanting Cubish to return to his good health ("Are we to assume that there is anything significant in this attitude of yours? That A: A butler might not "want" his master to recover his good health? That B: Said butler should endeavor to remove from the premises the only person capable of restoring said health, to said master?!"). He proceeds to accuse the astounded butler of attempted murder ("Where were you, the night of April the 16th? A likely story! I see it all now. You and the upstairs maid! 'Do the old boy in', you said! 'Elderberry wine and old lace', you said! 'Then, the quick getaway', you said! Rio de Janeiro, tropical nights, romance and a heavy bank account! But you weren't smart enough John, alias Johnny, alias Jack, alias Jackie!"), eventually asiding to the audience, "What's Humphrey Bogart got that I ain't got?" Having frightened the butler into incoherence, Daffy tricks him into fleeing the house in disguise, so as not to be arrested ("But just to show you I'm not all copper, I'm gonna give you a ten-minute headstart. Don't try to thank me now, get going! Hurry, they're on your trail! Run, out this way! AAAHHH! And stay on the straight-and-narrow.")
At last, Daffy makes it to Cubish's bedroom, but before he can even unpack his novelty items, he slips and falls on a tray of food, covering himself in cake. To Daffy's bemused resentment ("What's the matter? You see anything green? Any flies on me?!"), Cubish finds this sight hilarious and laughs uproariously. In the end, Cubish keeps Daffy on hand as his personal jester, merrily throwing pies at the duck's face while he stands against a target. "It's a living," Daffy asides to the audience.

Show Up! Live

Show Up! Live is Joey Yung's third major concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum and first world tour.
Neway Joey Yung Live Show Up! 2003 (Hong Kong).
The stage.
The stage was an in-the-round stage that featured a large circular stage in the middle and two catwalks stretching out from it. It also featured a large unit of projector screens and lights that was set up above the stage showing live footage as well as video backdrops to the audience on all sides of the arena. The stage also included multiple elevators and a rotating stage. Many props were used in the set as well, including a "winged unicorn", a large metal ball suspended in the air, a dragon, and a pink swing set.
The show.
For the opening of the show, a short musical piece called "Overture and Parade" was performed by dancers dressed as European soldiers. Shortly after, all the lights in the arena dimmed and a box lighted up as Joey sang a verse of "我的驕傲". Joey was then ascended into the air riding on a "winged unicorn", and circled around the arena while singing the rest of the re-arranged song. After the song Joey came down to sing "未知". After taking off her "Eskimo" inspired fut jacket, she performed two more songs, "特別嘉賓" and "抱抱" before leaving the stage for a costume change.
For the next act, Joey was raised on to the stage on a "golden dragon" while singing "隆重登場" followed by the concert theme Show Up!. After this medley of fast songs, Joey performed "出賣" (which was not recorded on DVD), "啜泣", and "想得太遠"
For the third act, Joey chose a member from the audience to go on a "date" with her while singing "再見我的初戀" and playing on a set of pink swings. She then sang "誰來愛我", covers of Mavis Fan's "雪人" and Stefanie Sun's "遇見", and "逃避你".
In the fourth act Joey, dressed like a Geisha" was raised in the air on a "metal ball" while singing "愛Ashiteru". She then performed "Mad About You" and "神魂顛倒" with her dancers before singing "美麗在望" while shaking hands with the audience.
For the next act, Joey asked the audience to sing along with her while she performed the ballads "習慣失戀", "爭氣", and "心淡".
For the sixth act, Joey sang a medley of songs with a string quartet. The medley included a cover of Faye Wong's "冷戰", Miriam Yeung's "可惜我是水瓶座", as well as "這分鐘更愛你". She then ended the act with a performance of 怯.
After the sixth act, the audience counted down the seventh act which was the planned encore. For this pre-planned encore, Joey performed a medley of fast songs including "不容錯失", "全身暑假", and "四面台". After the medley, Joey was suspended into the air and did a number of flips, followed by a "shower" sequence where Joey and her dancers played with water that fell down from above the stage. Joey then ended the night with a speech regarding what magazines would often write about her. She recognized the fact that even though the public generally agreed that she was a good vocalist, many people felt that as a performer her performances did not have enough visual appeal. So the main purpose of this concert was to prove that "Joey Yung is not only good to listen to, but also good to watch". She then ended the concert with her classic ballad, "痛愛". Many of the nights also had an actual encore segment, and the setlist of the segment varied every night.
Show Up! Live Tour.
The stage.
The stage for the shows outside of Hong Kong was smaller and less intricate. It consisted of a simple three-sided stage (as opposed to the large in-the-round stage used earlier for her Hong Kong shows) that had metal columns and two triangles that hung on each side of the stage.
The show.
The setlist performed was generally shorter and different from the one performed for Joey's Hong Kong shows. It highlighted certain performances from her Hong Kong shows as well as included songs that were in original rundown but performed in a different order and new songs that were released after the Hong Kong leg.
Rundown.
This is the general rundown Joey sang for most of the shows, though certain shows had slightly different rundowns.

Saints Denise (Dionysia, Dionisia), Dativa, Leontia, Tertius, Emilianus, Boniface, Majoricus, and Servus are venerated as martyrs by the Catholic Church. They were killed in the late 5th century during the persecution of Trinitarian Christians in Proconsular Africa by the Arian Vandals, according to Victor of Vita. These martyrs were killed during the reign of Arian king Hunneric.
According to Victor, Denise was a beautiful and widowed noblewoman, who was killed during this persecution. Denise’s son Majoricus was killed during the same persecution, as well as Denise’s sister Dativa. Denise was brutally whipped by the authorities.
and then died at the stake with her little child, Majoricus, and her sister Dativa.
Also killed were Leontia, daughter of Bishop Germanus of Perada (Paradana); a doctor named Emilius or Emelius (“Emilianus” according to Usuard), brother-in-law of Dativa; Tertius, a monk of Byzacena; and Boniface, surnamed Sibidense, who has been identified as Boniface, bishop of Sicilibba in Proconsular Africa. Emilius and Tertius were flayed alive.
Two other figures associated with the same persecution were venerated on the same feast day: Servus or Servius, who was martyred at Tuburbium; and Victoria or Victrix, who was tortured at Cucusa (Colusitana, Culcitana).
Servus was hung and dropped from ropes and then dragged through the streets, while Victoria was hung from the wrists above a fire. Victoria's husband begged her to abjure her faith and to think of her young children but she refused. Thinking her dead, the authorities left her on the ground. According to the legend, Victoria later recovered and stated that she had been miraculously cured by a young maiden.

Their cult was mentioned in the martyrologies of various ancient churches and in the martyrologies associated with Ado, Florus, and Usuard. The "Legendarium" associated with the convent of the canons regular at Böddeken records their legend in a codex dating from the 15th century (Biblioteca Teodoriana, Paderborn). The "Roman Martyrology" commemorates their feast day on December 6, although Servius’ name is recorded on December 7, and Victoria’s name is completely left out.
There was a cult in the late Middle Ages devoted only to Emilianus, which was popular especially in Naples, and at the end of the 14th century, he was chosen as the patron for a local society of pharmacists along with Saint Peregrine. A church was built in Emilianus’ honor at Naples.

The men's 200 metre freestyle event at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place on 18–19 September at the Jamsil Indoor Swimming Pool in Seoul, South Korea.
Australia's Duncan Armstrong stunned the entire field with a new world record to snatch the Olympic title in the event, regarding as one of the most delightfully surprising upsets in history. Swimming in lane six and coming from third at the final turn, he put a late resistant charge to edge out a star-studded field for the gold medal in 1:47.25. His time also sliced 0.19 seconds off the global standard set by West Germany's Michael Groß at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.
Sweden's Anders Holmertz overhauled U.S. swimmer Matt Biondi about the midway through the final stretch, but could not catch Armstrong near the wall to finish only with a silver in 1:47.89. Leading almost the entire race, Biondi faded down the stretch to demolish the 1:48 barrier and to settle for the bronze with a time of 1:47.99.
Poland's Artur Wojdat, a top qualifier on the morning prelims, dropped off the podium to a fourth-place time in 1:48.40. Meanwhile, Groß missed a chance to defend his Olympic title with a fifth-place finish in 1:48.59.

Dudley's theorem

In probability theory, Dudley’s theorem is a result relating the expected upper bound and regularity properties of a Gaussian process to its entropy and covariance structure. The result was proved in a landmark 1967 paper of Richard M. Dudley; Dudley himself credited Volker Strassen for making the connection between entropy and regularity.
Statement of the theorem.
Let ("X""t")"t"∈"T" be a Gaussian process and let "d""X" be the pseudometric on "T" defined by
For "ε" > 0, denote by "N"("T", "d""X"; "ε") the entropy number, i.e. the minimal number of (open) "d""X"-balls of radius "ε" required to cover "T". Then
Furthermore, if the entropy integral on the right-hand side converges, then "X" has a version with almost all sample path bounded and (uniformly) continuous on ("T", "d""X").

Bergmann 1896

The Bergmann 1896 was a 19th-century semi-automatic pistol developed by German designer Louis Schmeisser and sold by Theodor Bergmann's company. A contemporary of the Mauser C96 and Borchardt C-93 pistols, the Bergmann failed to achieve the same widespread success, although Bergmann himself later went on to design one of the earliest practical and successful sub-machine guns, the MP-18.
The first cartridges in Bergmann pistols were grooveless, with the bullets having a sharp nose to avoid jams. Later pistols, however, have mechanical extractors and cartridges with grooved flanges. The M96 had an internal box-magazine holding five cartridges.

Hendrick Lonck

Adm. Hendrick Corneliszoon Lonck (or Loncque and Loncq) (born 1568, Roosendaal – 10 October 1634, Amsterdam), a Dutch naval hero, was the first Dutch sea captain to reach the New World.
Early years.
He was born in Roosendaal in the southern Netherlands, of Brabant origin. His parents were Cornelis Pieterszoon Lonck and Dichna Heinrich. He was a full cousin of the Zeeland Vice Admiral Cornelis Symons Son Loncque. In 1604, he married Grietgen Lenaerts in Antwerp.
Career.
In 1606, Lonck captained the "Witte Leeuw" (White Lion), a 320-ton merchant ship armed for war, and approached the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Near Tadoussac, he boarded two of Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons' ships, pillaging them for cannons, furs, mounts, and munitions.
In 1623 and 1624, Lonck participated in the expedition of Admiral Willem de Zoete against the Barbary Coast pirates. Having made admiral by 1628, Lonck, in the service of the Dutch West Indies Company, joined Admiral Piet Hein in the Battle in the Bay of Matanzas, a naval battle during the Eighty Years' War in which a Dutch squadron was able to defeat and capture a Spanish treasure fleet. 
Lonck replaced Hein in 1629 as captain-general. In 1630, he commanded a Dutch colonizing expedition of 52 ships, 15 sloops, and 3,780 sailors that captured the historic city of Olinda, Brazil on 14 February, followed by the capture of the Brazilian state of Pernambuco after a feeble resistance by Matias de Albuquerque, its Portuguese Governor. It was to be his last voyage, returning to the Netherlands on 20 July 1630.
He died in Amsterdam and was buried on 10 October 1634 in the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam.

Alberta Highway 663

Alberta Provincial Highway No. 663 is a highway in the province of Alberta, Canada. It runs west-east from Highway 44 near Fawcett, runs concurrent with Highway 2 and Highway 63 to Boyle. Then to a concurrency with Highway 55 (Northern Woods and Water Route) in Lac La Biche before extending north around Lakeland Provincial Park to Torchwood Lake. It is also known as Taylor Road in Boyle, and 88 Avenue in Lac La Biche.
History.
In the 1940s the roads that become Secondary Highways were only dirt trails. Farmers would have to use axes to clear the brush of the boreal forest from the road allowance, and use plows and machinery pulled by horses to maintain the roads and fill in low spots that filled with water during spring melt and summer rains. These were not all weather roads, there were no snow ploughs to keep the roads clear over the winter months, so in the 1950s the larger farm trucks could only make it through a few months of the year. By 1957, the road saw an application of gravel to the surface, and was graded. A formal surveying crew came through in 1963 to clear brush and mark the path of the highway which was constructed in 1964.

Yehoshua Cohen

Yehoshua Cohen (; 1922–1986) was a leading member of Lehi, a Zionist militant group, who fired the fatal shots in the assassination of United Nations envoy Folke Bernadotte on September 17, 1948. Cohen was never charged for his role in the assassination, and was one of the founders of the Sde Boker kibbutz in the Negev Desert, where David Ben-Gurion later lived. While Ben-Gurion lived at Sde Boker, he and Cohen became close friends.
Early life and activity.
Cohen was born in the British Mandate of Palestine in 1922, the son of a farmer. He joined the Lehi at age sixteen, and soon became a prominent fighter within the organization. In 1942, after the arrest of a number of Lehi members, Cohen was "among the few who remained at large and recruited a new generation" of members. During the period, Cohen escaped the authorities despite a $3,000 bounty on his head, and in addition to recruiting new members, he practiced his marksmanship, training for future missions.
In September 1942, Cohen helped Lehi leader Yitzhak Shamir escape from a British prison. Cohen smuggled two Polish Army uniforms to Shamir and another prisoner, Eliahu Gilaldi, who disguised themselves in the uniforms and then crawled under the barbed wire surrounding the prison. For his role in the escape, Cohen became recognized as "Lehi's most valued fighter".
After helping Shamir escape from prison, Cohen became a leader in Lehi. He trained members in the tactics of guerilla warfare, and taught them how to build bombs and land mines.
Moyne assassination.
In 1944, the leaders of Lehi decided to assassinate Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State for the Middle East. Yitzhak Shamir originally planned the assassination, and chose Eliyahu Bet-Zuri and Eliyahu Hakim to carry it out. Cohen was picked to train the two assassins for their mission, and traveled from Tel Aviv to spend several weeks training the two in Jerusalem. After the assassination, Cohen became "a legend" within Lehi, and a reward was once again offered for his capture.
After the attack, Cohen was also involved in planning an attack on Harold MacMichael that failed. Shortly thereafter, Cohen was apprehended by the British and sent to a detention centre in Africa. On July 6, 1948, the British released Cohen, along with a large number of other detainees in response to Israel's independence.
Assassination of Bernadotte.
In 1948, the Lehi leadership decided that Folke Bernadotte, a United Nations mediator, "deserved a bullet", for his efforts to negotiate an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Lehi leadership approved of the assassination, and Yehoshua Zeitler began to make plans for it. Cohen was chosen to lead the actual attack on Bernadotte and picked two other long-time members: Yitzhak Ben Moshe and Avraham Steinberg, to join him.
Cohen began training his team in West Jerusalem in August, practicing with the weapons and tactics they would use in the assassination. During the planning stage, Zetler and Cohen chose to ambush Bernadotte on a narrow road in the Katamon neighborhood, blocking his vehicle with a Jeep across the road and then attacking.
On September 17, 1948, Cohen and his team put their plan into action. As planned, they placed a Jeep across the road to stop Bernadotte's convoy at around 5:00 PM. Moshe and Steinberg then opened fire on the tires of Bernadotte's vehicle, while Cohen fired inside the car with a MP40 machine gun, killing Bernadotte and his aide, Andre Serot.
After the attack, the identity of the assassins remained unclear for some time. Various nations accused each other of complicity in the attack, but eventually it became clear that Lehi was responsible. Although it was an open secret within Lehi and other groups that Cohen was behind the killing, his role was not made public for over forty years.
Later life and friendship with Ben-Gurion.
After the assassination, Cohen was one of the founders of the Sde Boker kibbutz, established in 1952. The kibbutz later became home to David Ben-Gurion, the former Prime Minister of Israel, in 1956. At Sde Boker, Cohen became Ben-Gurion's unofficial bodyguard and confidant, and the two grew very close. According to a "New York Times" article from 1964, Cohen became Ben-Gurion's "closest companion." Cohen also served as the head of security at Sde Boker.
Death and revelation of role.
Cohen's involvement in the assassination of Bernadotte was long-rumored, but was not confirmed during his lifetime. Historian Michael Bar-Zohar claimed for a number of years that Cohen had privately confessed in his role in the attack to Ben-Gurion, but Cohen never responded to these claims publicly.
Cohen died at Sde Boker of a heart attack in 1986, with his role in the attack still unclear, but in 1988 two of his co-conspirators in the attack, Yehoshua Zettler and Meshulam Markover, publicly confessed to their role in the attacks and confirmed that Cohen killed Bernadotte.

Army of the Peninsula

The Army of the Peninsula or Magruder's Army was a Confederate army early in the American Civil War. 
In May 1861, Colonel John B. Magruder was assigned to command operations on the lower Virginia Peninsula with Yorktown as headquarters. The Confederate Secretary of War LeRoy Pope Walker ordered the Department of the Peninsula into existence on May 26, and the military force was named for the department. Magruder fought a portion of his command to good effect at Big Bethel, an early Confederate victory.
By year's end, the force had swollen to 13,000 men, still commanded by Magruder, now major general. In April 1862 Magruder's army was incorporated into the right wing of the larger army of Joseph E. Johnston, preparing defenses against an expected attack by George B. McClellan in what would become the Peninsula Campaign. While the army designation ceased to exist, Magruder's army's independence and initiative was instrumental in preventing McClellan from rapidly advancing on Richmond.

Operation.
The Schwarzlose employs a very distinctive "blow-forward action" operating mechanism. It has no slide, instead the mechanism is operated by the barrel being projected forward due to the gas pressure and the friction of the bullet passing through the bore, the compressed recoil spring drives the barrel back, stripping the top cartridge from the magazine, chambering the round, and pressing the cartridge head against the standing breech, which is part of the frame.

In 1982, UCSD combined the engineering departments into the Division of Engineering, led by the first dean, Lea Rudee. It would be another ten years until the Division of Engineering was renamed the School of Engineering. This time, it was Robert Conn, an expert in plasma physics and semiconductors who was chosen to lead the new School. It was in 1997, when Qualcomm founder and former UCSD engineering professor Irwin Jacobs and his wife Joan Jacobs provided a $15 million endowment for the School, that the School went through a final name change leading to the current name in their honor. In 2003, Irwin and Joan Jacobs added to the endowment with a $110 million gift for scholarships, fellowships, and faculty support.
Currently.
The School's mission consists of three goals:
The School is housed in 8 buildings in and around Earl Warren College on the UCSD Campus. This includes Engineering Building Units (EBU) 1 and 2, Atkinson Hall (Calit2), the Center for Magnetic Recording Research, the Powell Structural Research Laboratory, the Powell-Focht Bioengineering Building, Computer Science, and the Structural Engineering Research Facility (SERF).

Glisenti Model 1910

The Glisenti Model 1910 was a 9mm calibre semi-automatic service pistol produced by the Italian company Societa Siderugica Glisenti. It was put in production in 1910 to replace the aging Bodeo Model 1889. It saw extensive service in World War I and World War II with the Italian Army. The Model 1910 has a complex and weak firing system which mandates that the pistol ought to use weaker cartridges than pistols of comparable caliber.
History.
Development.
The creation of a service pistol to supplant the Bodeo Model 1889 began to be rumored in late 1903. The pistol was designed by Italian inventor Bethel Abiel Revelli. Revelli spent multiple years developing a prototype before patenting his design to Societa Siderugica Glisenti of Turin. The Glisenti company acquired the machinery to begin production from the United Kingdom in 1906 but sold the manufacturing rights to Metallurgica Brescia gia Tempini. 
Original Design.
The Glisenti Model 1910 was originally designed to fire a 7.65x22mm bottle-neck cartridge. The pistol being known as the Model 1906 began production in 1908. The Model 1906 failed to impress the Italian Army and was requested to fire a round similar to the German 9×19mm Parabellum. The redesign was named the Model 1910 and was formally adopted by the Italian Army. To reduce recoil and because of the pistol's weak design, the Model 1910 had to fire the 9mm Glisenti. The 9mm Glisenti is structurally similar to the 9×19mm Parabellum but has a reduced velocity.
Design Details.
Mechanics.
The Model 1910 fires from a locked breech. When fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together. The barrel will stop in a rearward position. The bolt, unlocking itself, will then continue forward, stripping the chamber and driving the barrel forward again. After this action, a wedge will rise from the frame and lock the entire frame back into position. This firing system wasn't strong and had to fire cartridges weaker than the comparable 9x19 Parabellum caliber. The screw at the front of the frame, when undone will allow the removal of a plate on the left side of the pistol granting access to the moving parts within the pistol. This design was not stiff enough to sufficiently support the left side of the barrel extension and after prolonged firing, the left plate was prone to loosening. The only safety on the pistol was a small lever set in front of the grip.
Replacement.
Attempted Redesign.
Metallurgica Brescia gia Tempini in 1912 attempted to improve the design of the Model 1910. The improved pistol, referred to as the Brixia, was submitted to the Italian Army for approval. The Brixia had a strengthened frame and removed the grip safety but wasn't a big enough improvement to make a change in the Italian Army. The Brixia was later to be sold to the civilian market but the outbreak of World War I lead to the cancellation of the project.
End of Service.
The Glisenti remained in production until the early 1920s. In increasing numbers from 1916 onward, the Glisenti began to be phased out by the Spanish produced Ruby pistol and Beretta M1915. The Beretta later became the official service pistol in the Italian Army in 1934. The Glisenti was declared obsolete the same year but saw limited service in World War II.

Radiator (engine cooling)

Radiators are heat exchangers used for cooling internal combustion engines, mainly in automobiles but also in piston-engined aircraft, railway locomotives, motorcycles, stationary generating plant or any similar use of such an engine.
Internal combustion engines are often cooled by circulating a liquid called "engine coolant" through the engine block, where it is heated, then through a radiator where it loses heat to the atmosphere, and then returned to the engine. Engine coolant is usually water-based, but may also be oil. It is common to employ a water pump to force the engine coolant to circulate, and also for an axial fan to force air through the radiator.
Automobiles and motorcycles.
In automobiles and motorcycles with a liquid-cooled internal combustion engine, a radiator is connected to channels running through the engine and cylinder head, through which a liquid (coolant) is pumped. This liquid may be water (in climates where water is unlikely to freeze), but is more commonly a mixture of water and antifreeze in proportions appropriate to the climate. Antifreeze itself is usually ethylene glycol or propylene glycol (with a small amount of corrosion inhibitor).
The radiator transfers the heat from the fluid inside to the air outside, thereby cooling the fluid, which in turn cools the engine. Radiators are also often used to cool automatic transmission fluids, air conditioner refrigerant, intake air, and sometimes to cool motor oil or power steering fluid. Radiators are typically mounted in a position where they receive airflow from the forward movement of the vehicle, such as behind a front grill. Where engines are mid- or rear-mounted, it is common to mount the radiator behind a front grill to achieve sufficient airflow, even though this requires long coolant pipes. Alternatively, the radiator may draw air from the flow over the top of the vehicle or from a side-mounted grill. For long vehicles, such as buses, side airflow is most common for engine and transmission cooling and top airflow most common for air conditioner cooling.
Radiator construction.
Automobile radiators are constructed of a pair of header tanks, linked by a core with many narrow passageways, giving a high surface area relative to volume. This core is usually made of stacked layers of metal sheet, pressed to form channels and soldered or brazed together. For many years radiators were made from brass or copper cores soldered to brass headers. Modern radiators save money and weight by using plastic headers and may use aluminium cores. This construction is less easily repaired than traditional materials.
An earlier construction method was the honeycomb radiator. Round tubes were swaged into hexagons at their ends, then stacked together and soldered. As they only touched at their ends, this formed what became in effect a solid water tank with many air tubes through it.
Some vintage cars use radiator cores made from coiled tube, a less efficient but simpler construction.
Coolant pumps.
Radiators first used downward vertical flow, driven solely by a thermosyphon effect. Coolant is heated in the engine, becomes less dense, and so rises. As the radiator cools the fluid, the coolant becomes denser and falls. This effect is sufficient for low-power stationary engines, but inadequate for all but the earliest automobiles. All automobiles for many years have used centrifugal pumps to circulate the engine coolant because natural circulation has very low flow rates.
Heater.
A system of valves or baffles, or both, is usually incorporated to simultaneously operate a small radiator inside the vehicle. This small radiator, and the associated blower fan, is called the heater core, and serves to warm the cabin interior. Like the radiator, the heater core acts by removing heat from the engine. For this reason, automotive technicians often advise operators to turn on the heater and set it to high if the engine is overheating.
Temperature control.
Waterflow control.
The engine temperature on modern cars is primarily controlled by a wax-pellet type of thermostat, a valve which opens once the engine has reached its optimum operating temperature.
When the engine is cold, the thermostat is closed except for a small bypass flow so that the thermostat experiences changes to the coolant temperature as the engine warms up. Engine coolant is directed by the thermostat to the inlet of the circulating pump and is returned directly to the engine, bypassing the radiator. Directing water to circulate only through the engine allows the temperature to reach optimum operating temperature as quickly as possible whilst avoiding localised "hot spots." Once the coolant reaches the thermostat's activation temperature, it opens, allowing water to flow through the radiator to prevent the temperature rising higher.
Once at optimum temperature, the thermostat controls the flow of engine coolant to the radiator so that the engine continues to operate at optimum temperature. Under peak load conditions, such as driving slowly up a steep hill whilst heavily laden on a hot day, the thermostat will be approaching fully open because the engine will be producing near to maximum power while the velocity of air flow across the radiator is low. (The velocity of air flow across the radiator has a major effect on its ability to dissipate heat.) Conversely, when cruising fast downhill on a motorway on a cold night on a light throttle, the thermostat will be nearly closed because the engine is producing little power, and the radiator is able to dissipate much more heat than the engine is producing. Allowing too much flow of coolant to the radiator would result in the engine being over cooled and operating at lower than optimum temperature. A side effect of this would be that the passenger compartment heater would not be able to put out enough heat to keep the passengers warm. The fuel efficiency would also suffer.
The thermostat is therefore constantly moving throughout its range, responding to changes in vehicle operating load, speed and external temperature, to keep the engine at its optimum operating temperature.
On vintage cars you may find a bellows type thermostat, which has a corrugated bellows containing a volatile liquid such as alcohol or acetone. These types of thermostats do not work well at cooling system pressures above about 7 psi. Modern motor vehicles typically run at around 15 psi, which precludes the use of the bellows type thermostat. On direct air-cooled engines this is not a concern for the bellows thermostat that controls a flap valve in the air passages.
Airflow control.
Other factors influence the temperature of the engine, including radiator size and the type of radiator fan. The size of the radiator (and thus its cooling capacity) is chosen such that it can keep the engine at the design temperature under the most extreme conditions a vehicle is likely to encounter (such as climbing a mountain whilst fully loaded on a hot day).
Airflow speed through a radiator is a major influence on the heat it loses. Vehicle speed affects this, in rough proportion to the engine effort, thus giving crude self-regulatory feedback. Where an additional cooling fan is driven by the engine, this also tracks engine speed similarly.
Engine-driven fans are often regulated by a viscous-drive clutch from the drivebelt, which slips and reduces the fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling radiator fans. Electric fans are controlled by a thermostatic switch or the engine control unit. Electric fans also have the advantage of giving good airflow and cooling at low engine revs or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic.
Before the development of viscous-drive and electric fans, engines were fitted with simple fixed fans that drew air through the radiator at all times. Vehicles whose design required the installation of a large radiator to cope with heavy work at high temperatures, such as commercial vehicles and tractors would often run cool in cold weather under light loads, even with the presence of a thermostat, as the large radiator and fixed fan caused a rapid and significant drop in coolant temperature as soon as the thermostat opened. This problem can be solved by fitting a radiator blind to the radiator which can be adjusted to partially or fully block the airflow through the radiator. At its simplest the blind is a roll of material (such as canvas or rubber that is unfurled along the length of the radiator to cover the desired portion. Some older vehicles, like the World War I-era S.E.5 and SPAD S.XIII single-engined fighters, have a series of shutters that can be adjusted from the driver's or pilot's seat to provide a degree of control. Some modern cars have a series of shutters that are automatically opened and closed by the engine control unit to provide a balance of cooling and aerodynamics as needed.
Coolant pressure.
Because the thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines increases with internal temperature, the coolant is kept at higher-than-atmospheric pressure to increase its boiling point. A calibrated pressure-relief valve is usually incorporated in the radiator's fill cap. This pressure varies between models, but typically ranges from to .
As the coolant expands with increasing temperature, its pressure in the closed system must increase. Ultimately, the pressure relief valve opens, and excess fluid is dumped into an overflow container. Fluid overflow ceases when the thermostat modulates the rate of cooling to keep the temperature of the coolant at optimum. When the engine coolant cools and contracts (as conditions change or when the engine is switched off), the fluid is returned to the radiator through additional valving in the cap.
Engine coolant.
Before World War II, engine coolant was usually plain water. Antifreeze was used solely to control freezing, and this was often only done in cold weather.
Development in high-performance aircraft engines required improved coolants with higher boiling points, leading to the adoption of glycol or water-glycol mixtures. These led to the adoption of glycols for their antifreeze properties.
Since the development of aluminium or mixed-metal engines, corrosion inhibition has become even more important than antifreeze, and in all regions and seasons.
Boiling or overheating.
On this type of system, if the coolant in the overflow container gets too low, fluid transfer to overflow will cause an increased loss by vaporizing the engine coolant.
Severe engine damage can be caused by overheating, by overloading or system defect, when the coolant is evaporated to a level below the water pump. This can happen without warning, because at that point, the sending units are not exposed to the coolant to indicate the excessive temperature.
Opening a hot radiator drops the system pressure immediately and may cause a sudden ebullition of super-heated coolant. Therefore, since opening the cap on a hot radiator can result in steam burns to the unwary person, radiator caps often contains a mechanism that attempts to relieve the internal pressure before the cap can be fully opened.
History.
The invention of the automobile water radiator is attributed to Karl Benz. Wilhelm Maybach designed the first honeycomb radiator for the Mercedes 35hp.
Supplementary radiators.
It is sometimes necessary for a car to be equipped with a second, or auxiliary, radiator to increase the cooling capacity, when the size of the original radiator cannot be increased. The second radiator is plumbed in series with the main radiator in the circuit. This was the case when the Audi 100 was first turbocharged creating the 200. These are not to be confused with intercoolers.
Some engines have an oil cooler, a separate small radiator to cool the engine oil. Cars with an automatic transmission often have extra connections to the radiator, allowing the transmission fluid to transfer its heat to the coolant in the radiator. These may be either oil-air radiators, as for a smaller version of the main radiator. More simply they may be oil-water coolers, where an oil pipe is inserted inside the water radiator. As water is denser than air, this offers comparable cooling (within limits) from a less complex and thus cheaper oil cooler. Less commonly, power steering fluid, brake fluid, and other hydraulic fluids may be cooled by an auxiliary radiator on a vehicle.
Turbo charged or supercharged engines may have an intercooler, which is an air-to-air or air-to-water radiator used to cool the incoming air charge—not to cool the engine.
Aircraft.
Aircraft with liquid-cooled piston engines (usually inline engines rather than radial) also require radiators. As airspeed is higher than for cars, these are efficiently cooled in flight, and so do not require large areas or cooling fans. Many high-performance aircraft however suffer extreme overheating problems when idling on the ground - a mere 7 minutes for a Spitfire. This is similar to Formula 1 cars of today, when stopped on the grid with engines running they require ducted air forced into their radiator pods to prevent overheating.
Surface radiators.
Reducing drag is a major goal in aircraft design, including the design of cooling systems. An early technique was to take advantage of an aircraft's abundant airflow to replace the honeycomb core (many surfaces, with a high ratio of surface to volume) by a surface mounted radiator. This uses a single surface blended into the fuselage or wing skin, with the coolant flowing through pipes at the back of this surface. Such designs were seen mostly on World War I aircraft.
As they are so dependent on airspeed, surface radiators are even more prone to overheating when ground-running. Racing aircraft such as the Supermarine S.6B, a racing seaplane with radiators built into the upper surfaces of its floats, have been described as "being flown on the temperature gauge" as the main limit on their performance. 
Surface radiators have also been used by a few high-speed racing cars, such as Malcolm Campbell's Blue Bird of 1928.
Pressurized cooling systems.
It is generally a limitation of most cooling systems that the cooling fluid not be allowed to boil, as the need to handle gas in the flow greatly complicates design. For a water cooled system, this means that the maximum amount of heat transfer is limited by the specific heat capacity of water and the difference in temperature between ambient and 100°C. This provides more effective cooling in the winter, or at higher altitudes where the temperatures are low.
Another effect that is especially important in aircraft cooling is that the specific heat capacity changes with pressure, and this pressure changes more rapidly with altitude than the drop in temperature. Thus, generally, liquid cooling systems lose capacity as the aircraft climbs. This was a major limit on performance during the 1930s when the introduction of turbosuperchargers first allowed convenient travel at altitudes above 15,000 ft, and cooling design became a major area of research.
The most obvious, and common, solution to this problem was to run the entire cooling system under pressurization. This maintained the specific heat capacity at a constant value, while the outside air temperature continued to drop. Such systems thus improved cooling capability as they climbed. For most uses, this solved the problem of cooling high-performance piston engines, and almost all liquid-cooled aircraft engines of the World War II period used this solution.
However, pressurized systems were also more complex, and far more susceptible to damage - as the cooling fluid was under pressure, even minor damage in the cooling system like a single rifle-calibre bullet hole, would cause the liquid to rapidly spray out of the hole. Failures of the cooling systems were, by far, the leading cause of engine failures.
Evaporative cooling.
Although it is more difficult to build a cooling system able to handle steam, it is by no means impossible. The key requirement is to provide a system that condenses the steam back into liquid before passing it back into the pumps and completing the cooling loop. Such a system can take advantage of the specific heat of vaporization, which in the case of water is five times the specific heat capacity in the liquid form. Additional gains may be had by allowing the steam to become superheated. Such systems, known as evaporative coolers, were the topic of considerable research in the 1930s.
Consider two cooling systems that are otherwise similar, operating at an ambient air temperature is 20°C. An all-liquid design might operate between 30°C and 90°C, offering 60°C of temperature difference to carry away heat. An evaporative cooling system might operate between 80°C and 110°C, which at first glance appears to be less, but this overlooks the enormous amount of energy soaked up during the generation of steam, equivalent to 500°C. In effect, the evaporative version is operating between 80°C and 560°C, a 480°C effective temperature difference. Such a system can be effective even with much smaller amounts of water.
The downside to the evaporative cooling is the "area" of the condensers required to cool the steam back below the boiling point. As steam is much less dense than water, a correspondingly larger surface area is needed to provide enough airflow to cool the steam back down. The Rolls-Royce Goshawk design of 1933 used conventional radiator-like condensers and this proved to be a serious problem for drag. In Germany, the Günter brothers developed an alternative design combining evaporative cooling and surface radiators spread all over the aircraft wings, fuselage and even the rudder. Several aircraft were built using their design and set numerous performance records, notably the Heinkel He 119 and Heinkel He 100. However, these systems required numerous pumps to return the liquid from the spread-out radiators and proved to be extremely difficult to keep running properly. Efforts to develop this system had generally been abandoned by 1940.
Radiator thrust.
An aircraft radiator contained in a duct heats the air passing through, causing the air to expand and gain velocity. As a result, this is effectively a jet engine. High-performance piston aircraft with well-designed low-drag radiators (notably the P-51 Mustang) derived thrust from this effect. The thrust was significant enough to offset the drag of the duct the radiator was enclosed in and allowed the aircraft to achieve zero cooling drag. At one point, there were even plans to equip the Spitfire with a ramjet, by injecting fuel into this duct after the radiator and igniting it. Although ramjets normally require a supersonic airspeed, this light-up speed can be reduced where heat is being added, such as in a radiator duct.
Stationary plant.
Engines for stationary plant are normally cooled by radiators in the same way as automobile engines. However, in some cases, evaporative cooling is used via a cooling tower.

Radiator (heating)

Radiators and convectors are heat exchangers designed to transfer thermal energy from one medium to another for the purpose of space heating. The heating radiator was invented by Franz San Galli, a Prussian-born Russian businessman living in St. Petersburg, between 1855–1857.
Radiation vs. convection.
In practice, the term "radiator" refers to any of a number of devices in which a fluid circulates through exposed pipes (often with fins or other means of increasing surface area), notwithstanding that such devices tend to transfer heat mainly by convection and might logically be called convectors.
The term convection heater or "convector" refers to a class of devices in which the source of heat is not directly exposed. As domestic safety and the supply from water heaters keeps temperatures relatively low, radiation is inefficient in comparison to convection.
The international standard for energy efficient consumer products Energy Star recommends placing heat-resistant reflectors between radiators and exterior walls to help retain heat in a room. 
Types.
Hot water.
A hot-water radiator consists of a sealed hollow metal container filled with hot water by gravity feed, a pressure pump, or convection. As it gives out heat, the hot water cools and sinks to the bottom of the radiator and is forced out of a pipe at the other end. Anti-hammer devices are often installed to prevent or minimize knocking in hot water radiator pipes.
Hot water baseboard.
Traditional cast iron radiators are no longer common in new construction, replaced mostly with forced hot water baseboard style radiators. They consist of copper pipes which have aluminum fins to increase their surface area. These conduction boiler systems use conduction to transfer heat from the water into the metal radiators or convectors.
The radiators are designed to heat the air in the room using convection to transfer heat from the radiators to the surrounding air. They do this by drawing cool air in at the bottom, warming the air as it passes over the radiator fins, and discharging the heated air at the top. This sets up convective loops of air movement within a room. If the register is blocked either from above or below, this air movement is prevented, and the heater will not work. Baseboard heating systems are sometimes fitted with moveable covers to allow the resident to fine-tune heating by room, much like air registers in a central air system.
Steam.
Steam has the advantage of flowing through the pipes under its own pressure without the need for pumping. For this reason, it was adopted earlier, before electric motors and pumps became available. Steam is also far easier to distribute than hot water throughout large, tall buildings like skyscrapers. However, the higher temperatures at which steam systems operate make them inherently less efficient, as unwanted heat loss is inevitably greater.
Steam pipes and radiators are prone to producing banging sounds often incorrectly called water hammer. The bang is created when some of the steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the steam piping. Subsequently, steam picks up the water, forms a "slug" and hurls it at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud hammering noise and greatly stressing the pipe. This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy and is often caused by buildings settling and the resultant pooling of condensate in pipes and radiators that no longer tilt slightly back towards the boiler.
Fan assisted heat exchanger.
A fan-assisted radiator contains a heat exchanger fed by hot water from the heating system. A thermostatic switch energises an electric fan which blows air over the heat exchanger to circulate it in a room. Its advantages are small relative size and even distribution of heat. Disadvantages are fan noise and the need for both a source of heat and a separate electrical supply.
Underfloor.
Also known as "radiant heat", underfloor heating uses a network of pipes, tubing or heating cables is buried in or attached beneath a floor to allow heat to rise into the room. Best results are had with conductive flooring materials such as tile. The large surface area of such room-sized radiators allows them to be kept just a few degrees above desired room temperature, minimizing convection. Underfloor heating is more expensive in new construction than less efficient systems. It also is generally difficult to retrofit into existing buildings.
The Roman hypocaust employed a similar principle of operation.
Electric baseboard.
Similar in configuration to forced hot water baseboard—low profile units running along the base of a wall with a central heating element surrounded by radiating fins—electric baseboard heaters are inexpensive to produce and install. They offer instant heat and great reliability, but may be more or less cost-effective relative to other forms of heat depending on electricity prices.
Portable.
Electrically powered portable radiators come in two basic forms:

Continental Motors Company

Continental Motors Company was an American manufacturer of internal combustion engines. The company produced engines as a supplier to many independent manufacturers of automobiles, tractors, trucks, and stationary equipment (such as pumps, generators, and industrial machinery drives) from the 1900s through the 1960s. Continental Motors also produced Continental-branded automobiles in 1932–1933. The Continental Aircraft Engine Company was formed in 1929 to develop and produce its aircraft engines, and would become the core business of Continental Motors, Inc.
Company history.
In 1905, Continental Motors was born with the introduction of a four-cylinder, four stroke cycle L-head engine operated by a single camshaft.
1906 Type "O" engine was developed to power aircraft.
1929 A-70 radial, seven-cylinder engine was introduced. 170 hp @ 2000 rpm 4.625x4.625 = 543.91cuin (8.91L)
In August 1929, the Continental Motors Company formed the Continental Aircraft Engine Company as a subsidiary to develop and produce its aircraft engines.
Continental Motors entered into the production of automobiles rather indirectly. Continental was the producer of automobile engines for numerous independent automobile companies in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, including Durant Motors Corporation which used the engines in its Star, Durant, Flint and Rugby model lines. Following the 1931 collapse of Durant, a group having interest in Durant Motors began assembling their own cars, the De Vaux-Hall Motors Company, using the Durant body dies, in Grand Rapids, Michigan and Oakland, California and under the De Vaux brand name. When De Vaux-Hall collapsed in 1932, unable to pay creditors, Continental Motors assumed automobile assembly and marketed the vehicles under the Continental-De Vaux brand name for the balance of the 1932 model year.
Continental Motors introduced a completely new line of Continental-branded automobiles for 1933. These cars were not based upon the 1931 De Vaux, a product of the De Vaux-Hall, which had been using body dies left over from the former Durant produced by Durant Motors until 1930.
The 1933 Continentals were marketed in three model ranges: the largest and most expensive was the six-cylinder Ace, next was a smaller six called the Flyer and also the low-priced four-cylinder Beacon. The 1933 Beacon roadster was the lowest price full-size car offered for sale in the United States in the 1930s, costing only $US335. None of these met with success in the depression era economy. At this same time, Dominion Motors Ltd. of Canada was building the same Flyer and Beacon cars under arrangement with Continental for sale in Canadian market, and importing the larger Ace models. Dominion then converted to building Reo brand trucks. The Ace and Flyer models were discontinued at the close of the 1933 model year. Finding that its cars were unprofitable, Continental stopped assembling even Beacon automobiles during 1934.
Kaiser, working with a Continental-designed engine, introduced USA's first OHC inline six-cylinder engine. It debuted in Kaiser-owned Jeep Corporation vehicles in the mid-1960s.
Particular models of John Deere tractors are currently being supplied by Continental since the ownership transfer to Korea, as stated on the tractor's engine identification plate.
Automobiles that used Continental engines.
The following automobile companies used Continental engines:
Tractors that used Continental engines.
Some models used Continental engines for only part of their production lifespan; others used them exclusively. 
US military vehicles that used Continental engines.
Engines.
Contental built many engines for the US military, some by license, and many of unusual type.
Inline: several conventional gasoline I6s were built for trucks, the COA331 (licensed from REO), 6602, 22R, and AO895 (also used in some armored vehicles). Later the M-A-N licensed multifuel LDS427, LD465 and turbocharged LDT465 were developed, also for use in trucks. 
Radial: in the late 1930’s 7 and 9 cylinder air cooled radial aircraft engines were adapted for use in armored vehicles. The W670 and R975 were considered very reliable by the British in North Africa, but were not developed further.
Opposed: just after WWII an air cooled O6 was developed for armored vehicles. All were supercharged, AOS895-3 models had carburetors, -5 models had fuel injection with no increase in power, but greater fuel mileage.
V type: in the early 1950s an air cooled V12 engine was introduced for armored vehicles. Later the AVSI-1790 was developed into the AVDS-1790 diesel version, which was often retro-fitted to earlier vehicles.

Inception (McCoy Tyner album)

Inception is the debut album by jazz pianist McCoy Tyner which was released on the Impulse! label in 1962. It features performances by Tyner with Art Davis and Elvin Jones.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Alexander Gelfand states that "this album gives listeners the chance to hear what a very young Tyner sounded like outside the confines of the classic John Coltrane quartet of the early '60s; it reveals a lyrical approach to jazz piano that seems a far cry from Tyner's mature style".
Background.
"Blues for Gwen" was named after Tyner's sister, whilst "Sunset" was suggested by Tyner's wife, Aisha, because the piece "brought to her mind an impression of nature, and because it's a reflective ballad, "Sunset" seemed the logical title."

Korovin pistol

The Korovin pistol (Пистолет Коровина, Тульский Коровин (ТК), GAU Index 56-A-112) is regarded as the first Soviet semi-automatic pistol.
History.
Sergey Korovin designed the first 7.65 mm calibre military pistol around 1922, while working at the famous Tula arms factory TOZ. However, this model proved too complex and difficult. But in 1925 the sport society "Dinamo" placed an order for a 6.35 mm pocket pistol for sports and civic needs. By 1926, Korovin completed development of a model, and at the end of that year, TOZ began its release.
The following year the gun was approved for use, having received the official title of «Pistol TK Model 1926». The gun was not intended for the army, and it was considered a "civilian weapon". It was used by NKVD operatives, militsiya, senior officers of the Red ArmyСергей Монетчиков. Русские оружейники: Коровин - отечественный талант с бельгийским акцентом // журнал "Братишка", № 6, июнь 2002</ref> and senior government or party officials. TKs were often used as gifts or awards.
Some TK pistols remained in Sberkassa offices even after the end of the Great Patriotic War
Construction.
The pistol is of simple blowback type. A safety is located on the left side of the frame above the trigger; the magazine catch is located at the bottom of the grip.
The grip panels came in two types: plastic with the TOZ logo, or wooden. Wooden grips came in two versions: checkered or with larger vertical grooves. Until the early 1930s grips were secured with screws, later with spring latches.
Ammo.
The Korovin was developed for the .25 ACP cartridge, its construction was able to withstand greater pressure produced by a larger than normal amount of propellant (gunpowder).
TK construction allowed for usage of a more powerful cartridge of the same caliber - "6,35-мм пистолетный патрон (индекс ГАУ — 57-Н-112)". With this new ammunition, the muzzle velocity was increased.

Although smaller in size, it is derived from the .45 semi-automatic pistol Savage submitted to the 1906-1911 US Army trials to choose a new semi-automatic sidearm. After several years of testing the Savage pistol was one of two finalists but ultimately lost to the Colt entry, which became famous as the Colt Model 1911. 181 of these .45 ACP pistols were returned to Savage after the testing and sold on the civilian market.
The Model 1907 is often erroneously called a Model 1905 because of the date "Nov. 21, 1905" date stamped into the top of the slide on all Savage semi-automatic pistols. This is the date Elbert Searle was awarded one of his firearm patents, which were the design basis for all the Savage semi-automatic pistols. 
Advertised with the slogan "Ten shots quick!", the Model 1907 was very popular because, despite its small size, it had a 10 round double-stack magazine. A safety lever is located on the left side of the pistol, at the upper rear of the grip. Though it appears to have an external hammer, it is actually a striker-fired gun; the "hammer" is actually a cocking lever. Model 1907s made from 1913 until 1917 had a collared barrel and a loaded chamber indicator, allowing the shooter to tell by touching the shell ejection port whether a cartridge was chambered. The Model 1907 uses no screws (even the grips snap into place) and is simple to strip. The grips were made from gutta-percha, though some early production examples had metal grips. In 1912 the Model 1907 underwent a major design revision modifying almost every major component.
As with most semi-automatics, the pistol is readied for firing by pulling back and releasing the slide, which inserts a cartridge into the chamber and cocks the pistol. The recoil from firing a cartridge automatically extracts and ejects the empty shell, cocks the firing pin and loads another cartridge into the chamber, ready for firing.
Although the Model 1907 was designed for civilian use, the French government purchased over 40,000 .32 ACP Model 1907s between late 1914 and 1917 for the French military in World War I. These military "contract" pistols are recognized by the presence of a loaded chamber indicator and a lanyard ring, or mounting holes in the grip for a lanyard ring; lanyard rings were not available on civilian pistols. The Savage Model 1907 pictured to the right is a French contract pistol. A much smaller contract of 1,150 pistols in the same configuration were purchased by Portugal, which are distinguished by grips bearing the lesser arms of Portugal instead of the standard Indian head.
Savage made two other very similar semi-automatic pistols, with many parts in common with the Model 1907. The first was the hammerless Model 1915; the .32 Model 1915 was made only in 1915 and 1916 and the .380 model from 1915 until 1917. Like the Model 1907, the Model 1915 uses no screws. The other is the Model 1917, made from 1920 until 1926 in .32 and from 1920 until 1928 in .380. The Model 1917 is mechanically the same as and shares almost all of its parts with the final version of the Model 1907 (including a smaller, thinner cocking lever "hammer"), but with a significantly larger handle. Because this required larger grips, the Model 1917 uses one screw through each grip to hold them to the pistol frame.
In the 1978 film noir parody "The Cheap Detective", Sid Caesar's character, Ezra Desire, uses a model 1907, as does Jude Law's character "Harlan Maquire" in the 2002 crime drama "The Road to Perdition".

John M. Osborn

The John M Osborn’s short career as a wooden steam barge lasted just two years. The "Osborn" sank with the loss of five lives when she was rammed by the larger, steel hulled "Alberta" which was called a “steel monster" and "terror of the lakes". The "Osborn’s" wreck was discovered 100 years after her sinking. The wreck was illegally salvaged in the 1980s. Many of the "Osborn’s" artifacts became the property of the State of Michigan after they were seized from Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The State allows the museum to display the artifacts as a loan. The "Osborn's" wreck is now protected by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum.
Construction.
The "John M. Osborn" was a propeller wooden steam barge built in 1882 by Morley and Hill in Marine City, Michigan. She rebuilt in 1884 in Cleveland, Ohio for increased tonnage. She was owned by George F. Cleveland and the Cleveland Mining Ore Company.
Final voyage.
Captain Thomas Wilford’s wife Fannie and his two daughters, Cora and Adelaide were on board the "Osborn" on her final day of 27 July 1884. They enjoyed a sunny day walking the deck, attending Sunday school services, and talking to the sailors, including the mate, George F. Cleveland, who also owned the "Osborn". The children were to put to bed as night fell and a thick fog developed. Mrs. Fannie Wilford was uneasy and stayed near her husband’s side on deck near the bow.
The wooden "Osborn" was downbound for the Soo Locks with a cargo of 1,120 tons of iron ore and towing two schooner barges, the "George W. Davis" and the "Thomas Gawn". The "Alberta" was upbound with her usual amount of passengers and freight on her regular run between Owen Sound, Ontario and Port Arthur, Ontario. The "Osborn" carefully whistled her approach through the fog but one ship whistled once for a starboard course and the other ship whistled twice for a port course. Shipwreck historian Frederick Stonehouse wrote: As reported in the local papers, ‘the barge blew three whistles, the "Alberta" answering, and checked down to seven miles per hour, but in a moment the "Osborn" appeared under the "Alberta’s" bow and the latter struck her midway between the main and mizzen masts on the starboard side, cutting her almost in twain.’ When the larger , 2,282 ton, steel steamer "Alberta" rammed the smaller , 891 ton, wooden "Osborn", she penetrated to the center of the ship cutting her almost in two. The large gash in the "Osborn’s" hull caused the water to hit her hot boilers which exploded and immediately killed two crewmen. The "Alberta" stayed locked with "Osborn" long enough for Captain Wilford and his wife to transfer to her. One of the "Alberta’s" passengers jumped to the "Osborn" to save three lives, including Captain Wilford’s children. While this rescuer from the "Alberta" was still below decks, the "Osborn" broke free and took his life along with two crewmen.
Following the collision, the "Alberta" was vilified by the press. In her first year of service, she was involved in four minor collisions and a fifth major collision that sank the "Osborn". The "Cleveland News Leader" said of the "Alberta", "This huge steel monster, during the few months she has been afloat has become the terror of the lakes. Proud of her reputation as one of the fastest side-wheel steamers on fresh water, she has been run in an extraordinarily reckless manner." 
The "Buffalo Daily Courier" reported, “Since the collision much has been said about "Alberta" being cumbersome and unwieldy, to which the accident was partially attributed.
A lawsuit brought by the owners of the "Osborn" and her cargo lasted nearly three years. The United States District Court ruled both vessels were at fault for excessive speed for conditions. The "Osborn" loss was about $88,000 and the "Alberta’s" damages was about $20,000. Following admiralty rule for both vessels at fault, the damages were divided by deducting the "Alberta’s" loss from the "Osborn’s " loss and equally dividing the remainder with a pecuniary result of the "Alberta’s" owners paying the owners of the "Osborn" and her cargo $33,000. Years later Stonehouse concurred that thick fog and both ships traveling too fast for conditions was the likely cause of the disaster.
Wreck history.
The wreck of the "John M. Osborn" was discovered 100 years after she sank in 1984 by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society and the Oddessey Foundation of Lansing, Michigan. In 1985, shipwreck historian Frederick Stonehouse wrote, “Reportedly the "Osborn" is nearly intact and a time capsule of an earlier era of Great Lakes maritime history. “ However, Great Lakes diver Steve Harrington reported by 1990, “The remains of the "J.M. Osborn" were discovered in the mid-1980s and were quickly stripped for the benefit of a local museum. State officials turned a blind eye to the salvage operation.” 
Michigan’s Antiquities Act of 1980 prohibited the removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment 1992 raid on the GLSHS offices and Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum included seizure of artifacts that were illegally removed from the "John M. Osborn".
Wreck today.
Artifacts from the "Osborn's" wreck are on display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum as a loan from the State of Michigan by a 1993 settlement agreement with the GLSHS following the DNR raid on the museum in 1992. 
The "Osborn" lies in of water at in Whitefish Bay of Lake Superior. .
Scuba diving to the "Osborn" wreck requires advanced technical diving skills. Great Lakes diver Steve Harrington reported, “Today, the "J.M. Osborn" is upright and mostly intact. Divers enjoy exploring the hull, cargo holds, and cabins of the vessel. The name board and other key artifacts were recovered by the museum." The "Osborn" wreck is protected for future generations by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum.

Angel of Death (web series)

Angel of Death is a web series of eight to ten minute episodes created by Ed Brubaker. The series stars Zoë Bell as Eve, an assassin taking revenge on her former employers, and costars Lucy Lawless. "Angel of Death" was produced by White Rock Lake Production and distributed by Sony Pictures Television. The episodes were released on Crackle from March 2 to March 13, 2009.
Plot.
The show is a thriller about the assassin, Eve, who is employed by a ruthless crime family. After suffering a severe head trauma (knife through her head) while on the job, she begins to hallucinate and becomes haunted by her victims. As a result of her injury, Eve is driven to seek revenge on those who ordered the hits in the first place—her mob employers.
History.
While developing the story about a cold-blooded killer growing a conscience, Brubaker's original idea for the series was a hitman afflicted with brain cancer, but then remembered watching a scene in an old PBS documentary series where a patient walked into the ER with a hunting knife stabbed right through his skull, and drew inspiration from that for Eve's head injury. "Angel of Death" is Brubaker's first online series.
The show reunites Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi, and Zoë Bell - who all worked together on "". Bell was Lawless's stunt-double on the long-running series.
Other formats.
Once the show has finished its original online broadcast, it will be released on DVD, with new footage.
According to the letters page in Brubaker's "Incognito", the DVD is due to be released in June 2009.
A feature-length compilation of the web series is available for viewing on Hulu.

Mark Rappaport (creature effects artist)

Mark Rappaport (born 1954) is an American special effects/makeup artist. 
His main body of work is with special effects in a wide variety of films from science fiction to horror, to comedy and theater. Mark has created hyper-realistic animatronic animals including the horse used by Tom Cruise in "The Last Samurai" and memorable prosthetic makeup effects for "300" and "I Am Legend". His company, Creature Effects, Inc.is at the leading edge of the Hollywood creature and makeup effects industry. 
Mr. Rappaport was born in Yokohama, Japan. At the age of three Mark’s family moved to the Napa Valley in northern California. Mark graduated high school in Napa and attended San Diego State University where he earned a Bachelor of Science Degree. Upon graduation Mark returned to Northern California and worked in law enforcement before meeting and working with Bob Hartman, a San Francisco puppeteer and street performer. Mark’s work with Bob sparked an interest in creating effects for the entertainment industry and he pursued employment at Industrial Light & Magic. At ILM he worked on feature film projects, including "Innerspace" and "". From ILM Mark went to work with Chris Walas and created effects for films including "The Fly II" and "Child's Play". 
"The Last Samurai".
The production of "The Last Samurai" required an animatronic horse capable of performing stunt sequences that would put a real horse and rider at risk of great injury. Rappaport was commissioned to build a horse that could seamlessly replace Tom Cruise' real horse for those scenes. Mark says "It's probably the most sophisticated horse or animatronic creature ever made for film. It cost $1.5 million to make. It gallops in place. It reared up. It fell over. And it looks completely real." 
"300".
Mark Rappaport (creature effects supervisor) and Shaun Smith (makeup effects supervisor) teamed up to create the world of effects for "300". This extensive body of work included prosthetic makeups, animatronic animals, props, weaponry and costume elements. In addition to the amazingly lifelike horse effects for this film, Rappaport created an animatronic wolf puppet for scenes where young Leonidas faces off with the predatory animal. "The filmmakers shot interactions of the practical puppet attacking young Leonidas in a narrow rock crevice. Veteran creature effects supervisor Mark Rappaport and his team mechanized the puppet with eye-blinks, head neck, brow, jaw and tongue movement, saliva tubes and glowing eyes." 
"I Am Legend".
For "I Am Legend", starring Will Smith Mark Rappaport developed full body, silicone makeups for the primal, aggressive beings known as "Darkseekers". The translucent makeup creates the look of infection and spiked metabolism desired by director Francis Lawrence. The makeups were to be applied to very thin performers to create the look of zero body-fat and protruding veins. The makeups included rotting teeth dentures and full dilated pupil contact lenses. In addition to the creature makeups, Mark's studio created animatronic, likeness puppets of "Sam" the German Shepherd, a digital scan model for the infected dogs, scar and knife wound appliances for Will Smith and numerous other effects for the production.
"True Grit/Cowboys and Aliens".
After designing and producing a ride-able animatronic horse for , Mark's Studio created a second ride-able horse for Bedtime Stories. The motion and animatronic features of the two horses were enhanced and refined for True Grit and further developed for Cowboys & Aliens. The animatronic horses are used where the action, if performed by real horses, might put the riders or horses at risk of harm or injury.

Avenida Santa Fe

Avenida Santa Fe is one of the principal thoroughfares in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The artery is essential to the imaginary axis of Barrio Norte in Buenos Aires, comprising the areas influenced by the route of the avenue through Retiro, Recoleta and Palermo neighborhoods, it is considered one of the main shopping and strolling areas of the city, its many boutiques range from elegant to edgy, which has led it to be dubbed the 'Avenue of Fashion'. Upscale Alto Palermo, at Avenida Coronel Díaz, is one of the city's best-known vertical malls. Avenida Santa Fe is also an attraction for its architecture, strongly reminiscent of Paris. Its name pays homage to the eponymous province in Argentina.
History.
First laid out in colonial Buenos Aires as "San Gregorio Street" in 1774, it was at the time the northern limit of the growing port city. Following the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806, it was renamed for one of the popular heroes of the invasion's defeat, Pío Rodríguez. The declaration of autonomy from the Spanish Empire in 1810 led city officials to rename it "Calle Estrecha" (the "Narrow Street"). The progressive Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, Martín Rodríguez, had the narrow street widened in 1822, following which Bernardino Rivadavia, the first President of Argentina, renamed it "Santa Fe Avenue". Mayor Torcuato de Alvear, inspired by the urban redevelopment works in Paris at the hand of Baron Haussmann, drew up master plans for major boulevards, running east to west, every six blocks and in the 1880s, the avenue was included in the plan and widened. A 1967 ordinance made the avenue a one-way thoroughfare, west to east.
Overview.
Santa Fe Avenue officially begins on the southern end of Plaza San Martín and the northern end of pedestrian Florida Street. The avenue affords a view of the Art Deco Kavanagh building and Plaza Hotel (officially on Florida St.) and passes by the former Haedo and Paz palaces (today public buildings) before leaving the plaza's leafy surroundings. It continues westward along the Retiro area, passing by the Brunetta ("Olivetti") Building (built in 1964, one the first in Buenos Aires designed in the International Style) and through the massive Avenida 9 de Julio, which was opened through the Retiro area in the early 1970s. The Greek Revivalist Argentine Scientific Society and the Art Deco Regina Theatre follow and, past Avenida Callao, Santa Fe Avenue enters its Recoleta stretch. This stretch of the upscale thoroughfare is considered one of the main shopping districts in the city.
Just past Callao Avenue, the former Grand Splendid Theatre was converted in 2000 into the El Ateneo Bookstore, the most important in Latin America. Past Pueyrredón Avenue, Line of the Buenos Aires Metro was laid out underneath Santa Fe in the 1920s. The availability of frequent subway stations past this point has helped maintain the more residential setting of the remaining stretches of the avenue. Past Coronel Díaz Avenue, the avenue provides easy access to the Alto Palermo Shopping Center, one of the most important in Buenos Aires. Entering the Palermo district, it continues past the Buenos Aires Zoo, the Botanical Garden and Plaza Italia, a point overlooked by the Monument to the "Sword of Italy," Giuseppe Garibaldi. The avenue continues past the Argentine Rural Society's ornate exposition grounds and into the Carranza Viaduct, where it becomes Cabildo Avenue.

Terwillegar Drive

Terwillegar Drive is a developing freeway in south-west Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It is under construction, with the majority of its intersection at-grade, it retains its arterial road status. Once completed, it will be the third freeway in Edmonton not to have a highway designation after Groat Road and Wayne Gretzky Drive.
Because of the recent developments in the Windermere area, and the lack of proper signage, it remains unclear where the transition from 170 Street SW to Terwillegar Drive occurs, and the transfer from the SW to NW quadrant occurs. The placement of Quadrant (1) Avenue is approximately where Ambleside Link lays, however the 2009 edition of MapArt's City of Edmonton map places the quadrant line on Windermere Boulevard. Edmonton has adapted a quadrant system because portions lay south of Quadrant (1) Avenue, creating duplicates in Avenue numbers, addresses on 41 Avenue and south have been encouraged to include NW to avoid confusion with addresses south of Quadrant (1) Avenue.
In a Leduc County growth study, dated 2008, the expressway will continue south, west of the Edmonton International Airport, and then swing east across Highway 2 south of Leduc, and join Highway 2A between Kavanagh and Leduc, which is also scheduled to be twinned.

Harvard Girl

Harvard Girl (full title "Harvard Girl Liu Yiting: A Character Training Record"; ) is a book written by Liu Weihua () and Zhang Xinwu (), which describes how they raised their daughter, Liu Yiting (), to be accepted to Harvard University. Published in 2000 in Chinese by the Writers Publishing House, the book details the rigorous lifestyle that Liu led and includes advice from Liu's parents on how to raise children to gain acceptance to top-tier universities; it has been described as a "manual" for child-rearing and early education. 
The book was a bestseller in mainland China and made both Harvard and Liu Yiting household names among Chinese parents and students. It has since had numerous imitators, spawning an entire genre of how-to books on child-rearing for Chinese parents.
Liu Yiting.
Liu was raised in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Liu's parents, believers in the value of early childhood education, subjected her to a rigorous education beginning when she was only 15 days old. For example, to ensure that someone was always talking to Liu, they invited relatives over to the house. They also had her participate in "character-building" physical exercises such as swimming, jumping rope, and holding ice in her hands for extended periods of time. In addition to these activities, Liu acted in a soap opera when she was five years old.
While in high school, Liu participated in a student exchange program and visited America in 1998. This experience changed her views about life in America—like many Chinese citizens, most of her impressions about America came from Hollywood, and when she came to the country she was "surprised that didn't see any street fights or police-car chases". The program also piqued her interest in American universities, where she realized she would be able to study a variety of subjects. 
Although they had been training her to attend a preeminent university, Liu's parents had not expected that she would attend an American one; her mother has said that she had not been aware (until Liu came back from America) that Chinese students could apply to American universities. At the time, it was unusual for Chinese students to attend American schools as undergraduates—most only applied to schools abroad for postgraduate education. 
But rather than taking the "gaokao" (China's national college entrance examination) and attending one of the National Key Universities, Liu applied and was accepted to several schools (including Harvard, Columbia, Wellesley, and Mount Holyoke), from which she ultimately chose to attend Harvard. Not long afterwards, a local newspaper announced her acceptance and the family was "besieged with thousands of phone calls".
At Harvard, Liu majored in applied mathematics and economics and earned high grades; she also chaired the Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations, a student organization. She was described as "unassuming" and a "typical student", to the point that it took her roommate four years to realize Liu was a celebrity in China. In 2003, Liu graduated and took a job at the Boston Consulting Group in New York City.
Description.
Liu Weihua (Liu's mother) and Zhang Xinwu (Liu's stepfather) published "Harvard Girl" in 2000, after Liu had matriculated at Harvard. According to Liu, her parents had plans early on to write about their parenting methods, but they waited until 2000 to publish the book, relying on Liu's perceived success to establish themselves as "experts". The book primarily consists of research-like notes and diary entries, which Liu and her parents began recording and saving before Liu was in first grade. Liu herself helped edit the book, and wrote several of the later chapters. 
One major element of the child-rearing strategy described in the book was treating Liu as an adult and "encourag her to develop a mature style of thinking". Liu's parents never used baby talk when Liu was a child, and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments like an adult. According to education scholar Ben Mardell, the book's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a "break with the past" in China, where both early and higher education often emphasize rote learning.
In addition, the book details the rigorous "character-building exercises" Liu's parents had her perform. In addition to having her do physical exercises, Liu's parents controlled her diet. They also frequently took her traveling, both on short trips to nearby rural areas and on longer trips to historical sites such as Xi'an. Throughout the book, high value is placed on "full development", and the writers encourage parents to cultivate more than just academic ability in their children.
The book also includes supplementary chapters on topics such as how to select which schools to apply to, and advice for students on filling out applications and taking TOEFL and SAT exams.
Impact.
The book was at the top of China's bestseller list for 16 months, during which time it sold at least 1.5 million copies and the writers were estimated to have earned at least the equivalent of $100,000 in royalties. It became a must-have book for middle-class parents in China. The popularity of "Harvard Girl" made Liu a "national superstar" and an "idol" for Chinese parents,劉亦婷，已成為許多中國家長心目中的偶像，教育的偶像。 ("English": "Liu Yiting has become an idol in the eyes of many Chinese parents, an education idol.").</ref> and she frequently received fan mail and drew large crowds at book signings in mainland China. The success of this and similar books (another bestseller in 2001 and 2002 was Robert Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad Poor Dad") in mainland China has been said to reflect a "national obsession" among Chinese parents to get their children into top-ranking American schools. 
"Harvard Girl" was followed by numerous imitations by parents of other successful students, and is said to have spawned an entire genre of education "manuals" for Chinese parents, including similar books on how to get one's children into schools such as Oxford University, Cambridge University, or Columbia University. This genre includes titles such as "Ivy League is Not a Dream", "From Andover to Harvard", "How We Got Our Child Into Yale", "Harvard Family Instruction", "The Door of the Elite", "Harvard Boy Zhang Zhaomu", "Harvard Talents: Children Cultivated by the Karl Weter Educational Law", "Tokyo University Boy", "Cornell Girl", and "Our Dumb Little Boy Goes to Cambridge". 
Comparable books have also been published in South Korea, although American undergraduate universities are not "revered" in the same way there as they are in mainland China. In addition to imitators, Liu's parents have written their own follow-up: "Harvard Girl 2: Liu Yiting's Studying Methods and Upbringing Details" (＜哈佛女孩刘亦婷＞之二： 刘亦婷的学习方法和培养细节), which describes Liu's four years in college, was published in 2004 by Writers Publishing House.
The book also had an impact on applications to Harvard. It made Harvard a household name in China, and books of this genre caused a significant increase in the number of Chinese applicants to top-tier American universities. In 1999, when Liu applied to Harvard, a total of 44 Chinese students applied there—in 2008, 484 did.
Criticisms.
The book has been criticized for increasing the pressure many Chinese students already had to succeed in school, and for taking advantage of the widespread belief that admission into leading universities is necessary for success in life. Some critics have called the book "boastful". A 2001 study by a group of educators claimed that the strategies described in the book would not work for everyone even though they had worked for Liu, and that many families following the book's advice would be disappointed.
A 2004 book by Xiao Hui (萧愚), entitled "Raising Children Requires Great Wisdom: The Truth About "Harvard Girl Liu Yiting"" (教育孩子需要大智慧：“哈佛女孩刘亦婷”真相), harshly criticizes "Harvard Girl", calling the methods described in the book "false character building" ("伪素质教育") and claiming that Liu gained entrance into Harvard not because of her comprehensive or well-rounded education, but by exploiting loopholes and defects in Harvard's admissions policy for Chinese students or by taking advantage of "guanxi", personal relationships and networks.
Many successful Chinese students after Liu have tried to distance themselves from the so-called "Harvard Girl Phenomenon"; Harvard students Yin Zhongrui and Tang Meijie have both stated they do not want to be compared to "Harvard Girl". Yin's mother published a book, "From Andover to Harvard", about how her son was accepted by Harvard, but Yin only allowed his full name to appear in the book's preface. Tang received at least six offers from publishers to have a book written about her, but declined them all. Nevertheless, many of China's top students are still compared to "Harvard Girl", and admissions to top overseas universities often make big news in mainland China; for example, Cheng Wanxin (程琬芯) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009.

Lucia Dlugoszewski

Lucia Dlugoszewski (June 16, 1931 – April 11, 2000) was a Polish-American composer, performer and inventor. She created over a hundred musical instruments, including the timbre piano, a sort of prepared piano in which hammers and keys were replaced with bows and plectra.
Background and early years.
The daughter of Polish immigrants, Dlugoszewski was born and raised in Detroit. She studied piano at the Detroit Conservatory of Music and was a pre-medical student at Wayne State University, where she also took physics courses. Surprised and disappointed by an unsuccessful application to medical school in 1950, Dlugoszewski spontaneously moved to New York City, where she would spend the rest of her life. In New York, Dlugoszewski took piano lessons from Grete Sultan and studied analysis with Felix Salzer and composition with Edgar Varèse. Apart from a handful of piano preludes and sonatas, Dlugoszewski had written little music prior to 1950, but once in New York, she quickly became a prolific composer of experimental music, including several open-form works.
Major works.
Dlugoszewski’s compositions have been recorded for Nonesuch Records, Folkways, CRI, and other important contemporary music labels. Her 1975 piece "Abyss and Caress", for trumpet and small orchestra, was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and premièred by Pierre Boulez. In 1977, she became the first woman to win the Koussevitzy International Recording Award with "Fire Fragile Flight", for 17 instruments – the work became a signature piece for the Philadelphia ensemble Orchestra of Our Time. The recordings for Nonesuch and CRI released in the 70s were reissued by CRI in 2002 as "Disparate Stairway Radical Other" along with new work for string quartet and timbre piano.
Beginning in 1957, Dlugoszewski cultivated a professional and personal relationship with the dancer and choreographer Erick Hawkins. Dlugoszewski, a dancer herself, wrote chamber and orchestral scores for the Erick Hawkins Dance Ensemble as well as for the Foundation for Modern Dance. Her music for dance includes "Journey of a Poet", written for and executed by Mikhail Baryshnikov, and "Taking Time to be Vulnerable", for Pascal Denichou. She also contributed music for chamber ensemble to the soundtrack of the 1962 avant-garde film "Guns of the Trees", directed by Jonas Mekas. A very early performance of her timbre piano can be heard in her music for Marie Menken's1945 film "Visual Variations on Noguchi.," a score perhaps added later in the early 50s when the composer had arrived in New York.
During a conversation with Cole Gagne in the early 1990s, Dlugoszewski expressed ambivalence at having composed so many collaborative pieces, pointing out that while writing for film and dance allowed her music to be heard by enormous numbers of listeners, those audiences could not give her music their undivided attention.
Inventions.
Like that of Pauline Oliveros, Harry Partch and Moondog, Dlugoszewski’s music was animated by the invention and construction of new musical instruments, many of which she performed on. In her interview with Gagne, the composer estimated that she had constructed or designed at least a hundred instruments during her career (a frequent partner was the sculptor Ralph Dorazio, who built instruments to Dlugoszewski’s specifications). She was inspired, she told Gagne, by her teacher Varèse, who used electronic tools to create disorienting and exciting new sonorities. “It’s not that I was out to invent instruments,” said Dlugoszewski, “but that I wanted to create an ego-less sound possibility, a suchness possibility, so that you would help the ear just to hear the sound for its own sake.”
Most of Dlugoszewski’s invented instruments are percussive: pianos, drums, rattles and gourds. She created dozens of new instruments, many made of plastic, for a single 1961 work, "Eight Clear Places". Dlugoszewski retreated from invention after the early 1960s, preferring to explore the possibilities of the huge array of instruments which she by then had at her disposal.
Philosophy.
Dlugoszewski, like other composers of her generation, claimed a wide and varied assortment of influences, many of them Eastern in origin (Noh drama and haiku, for example). She was exceptional, though, for her belief in the power of subtlety in music. Virgil Thompson described hers as “music of great delicacy.” Dlugoszewski's music is remarkable for its use of silence and of gentle, muffled sounds, especially considering that much of her repertoire is for percussion instruments.

Fort Wright (Tennessee)

Fort Wright was constructed in 1861 and located on the second Chickasaw Bluff at Randolph, Tipton County, Tennessee. Fort Wright was a Civil War fortification and the first military training facility of the Confederate Army in Tennessee.
History.
On January 20, 1861 the Memphis "Appeal" published a pro-secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis from invaders. In a communiqué sent to LeRoy P. Walker, the first Confederate States Secretary of War, Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow endorsed Randolph on April 26, 1861 as "the most eligible situation for a battery to protect Memphis". Within a few days, in late April of that same year, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered Lieutenant Colonel Marcus Joseph Wright to establish a camp at Randolph and complete the fortification. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task. It took four months to fortify the bluff at Randolph with earthen defenses and artillery batteries in order to protect the fort from land and naval attacks. 
By June 1861, the construction of the fortification was not yet completely finished. However, 50 cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright by that time, "mostly thirty-two pounders; the rest larger, 42s and 64s. Thirty-two of them are mounted". The Memphis "Bulletin" published a status report of Fort Wright after a visit at the fortification on June 22, 1861. By that time, the "earthen breastworks have been sodded with grass" and were reported "twenty to thirty feet in thickness" (6–10 m). Only one "narrow defile on the landward side" was reported by the "Bulletin" which was "defended by heavy guns" and "crossed by an earthen wall thirty to forty feet in thickness" (10–12 m). A "crescent shaped wall" to the east of the fortification provided a defense from land attacks. Fort Randolph, a second Confederate stronghold in the area, was constructed only months after Fort Wright, in Fall 1861.
Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821–77) and Alexander P. Stewart (1821–1908) trained at Fort Wright. Stewart was promoted to the rank of Major in the "Tennessee Militia" by Governor Harris and was assigned "command of the heavy artillery and water batteries (...) at Fort Wright" shortly after his own training there was completed. Stewart "organized and trained 20 batteries of Tennessee artillery" at Fort Wright at Randolph. Both Forrest and Stewart would later become important figures in the rank of Lieutenant General in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Other future leaders in the Army of Tennessee and Forrest's cavalry received training at Fort Wright. 
Fort Wright was Tennessee's first military training camp in which soldiers could gain experience in the construction of fortifications and the setup of artillery batteries to counter naval attacks. They could undertake defense drills and acquire general military skills and discipline. Soldiers who were trained at Fort Wright fought in battles on different battlefields later in the war, the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Belmont, the Battle of Murfreesboro, the Battle of Chickamauga, the Battle of Franklin and the Battle of Bentonville. The Confederate stronghold at Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861, it was abandoned by the Confederate infantry by 1862 but sporadically occupied by other southern forces during the Civil War. 
In 2008, only a powder magazine is left of Fort Wright.

Fort Randolph (Tennessee)

Fort Randolph was a Confederate Army fortification built in 1861 during the Civil War. Fort Randolph was located on the second Chickasaw Bluff at Randolph, Tipton County, Tennessee. 
History.
By June 1861, the first Confederate fortification at Randolph, Fort Wright, was close to completion. Fort Randolph, the second Confederate stronghold in the area, was constructed only months after Fort Wright, in Fall 1861. The fortification was situated on the Mississippi River bluffs, about southwest of Fort Wright. In a dispatch published by the New York Times in March 1862, Fort Randolph is described as a "rough and incomplete earthwork (...) built upon the Second Chickasaw Bluffs , more than 100 feet above the river". The position of the fortification allowed a view of the Mississippi River for , both upstream and downstream. Boats approaching the fort on the river could be detected early from this strong position. Confederate troops at the garrison could prepare for naval attacks on the fort and Union Army supply boats passing on the Mississippi River could be attacked from the elevated position of Fort Randolph without much risk of immediate retaliation.
The town of Columbus, Kentucky, located ca. north of Randolph on the Mississippi River, was reported robbed and burnt down by Confederate forces in March 1862. "Everything was destroyed that could not be carried away." The rebels fled downstream to hide out at Fort Randolph in order to evade capture by Union troops.
In October 1864, Lieutenant Colonel Jesse A. Forrest, one of General Nathan Bedford Forrest's five brothers, was in command of a company of the 16th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment at Fort Randolph. Confederate units that had suffered considerable loss or which had been fragmented in the course of the Civil War were aggregated and re-organized in the 16th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. On October 27, Forrest's men attack the Steamboat "Belle" of St. Louis, Missouri from Fort Randolph. The "Belle" was on her way upstream from Memphis loaded with cotton bales, heading north to St. Louis. After the boat had landed at Randolph to pick up more payload, she was attacked by Confederate rebels. In the attack, one Union Army Major was killed on the vessel; 26 of the crew, who had gone ashore for freight, were captured by Confederate guerrillas when the captain had the steamboat push back out into the river in order to escape and save the boat from capture or destruction. The rebel forces suffered two casualties during the attack.
In 2008, Fort Randolph is no longer in existence.

Sonjuk Bridge

Sŏnjuk Bridge is a Koryo-dynasty stone bridge located in Kaesong, North Korea. Built in 1290, it is famous as the place where famed Confucian scholar and statesman Jeong Mong-ju was assassinated, allegedly on the orders of the Yi Bang-won, son of the first king of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Seong-gye. The bridge was closed to all traffic in 1780 and has since been a national monument.
Assassination of Jong Mongju.
A famously loyal advisor to the king of Goryeo, Jeong was a staunch political opponent of Yi Seonggye. On his way home after a party held for him by the future king, he was ambushed by five men on the bridge and brutally murdered with an iron hammer. Later canonized as a Korean sage, and revered even by Joseon monarchs, Jong's death came to symbolize unwavering loyalty. A brown spot on one of the stones is said to be Jong's bloodstain, and to become red when it rains. A famous poem of his records his final thoughts:
"Even if I may die, die a hundred times," <br>
"Even if my skeleton may become dust and dirt," <br>
"And whether my spirit may be there or not," <br>
"My single-hearted loyalty to my lord will not change."
Pyochung Pavilion.
Built during the Joseon dynasty, this small wooden structure houses two enormous stone stele mounted on the backs of lion-turtles, one erected in 1740 by King Yeongjo and the other by King Gojong in 1872. Both commemorate Jeong Mongju's assassination, and praise his loyalty to the Goryeo dynasty.

Mendell began covering Barack Obama on a regular basis in 2003, during Obama's U.S. Senate campaign.
While covering the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois, Democratic candidate and state comptroller Daniel Hynes accused Mendell of alluding in an article that Hynes' wife, Christina, was sexually attracted to Barack Obama; in the January 24, 2004 story, Mendell discussed Obama's personal charm and wrote, "Obama grabbed the hand of Christina Hynes...and then kissed her cheek prompting her to flush and smile broadly." The reference to Christina Hynes was changed in subsequent "Chicago Tribune" editions to "a supporter of an opponent." 
Mendell wrote the biography "", which was published in 2007. In writing the book, Mendell utilized both the first-hand research from Mendell's original reporting, as well as a wide range of interviews with Obama's aides, mentors, political adversaries and family. The "National Review" called "Obama: From Promise to Power" "the single best source of background information on our new president."

John Yates Beall

John Yates Beall (January 1, 1835 – February 24, 1865) was a Confederate privateer in the American Civil War who was arrested as a spy in New York and executed at Fort Columbus, Governors Island, New York.
Early life and education.
He was born in Jefferson County, Virginia, now West Virginia, on his father's farm, Walnut Grove. He attended the University of Virginia to study law but on the death of his father he left his studies to take up farming in 1855. 
Civil War.
At the start of the war, he joined Bott's Grays, Company G, in the 2nd Virginia Infantry. He received a wound in the lungs which left him incapable of active service.
Inspired by John Hunt Morgan, he conceived a plan to launch privateers on the Great Lakes. He presented his plan to Confederate authorities, who were interested, but declined to act since it might endanger relations with neutral England. However, Beall was commissioned as acting master in the Confederate States Navy, though not given a command. He then proceeded on his own as a privateer, active in the areas of the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. He assembled a crew of 18 men, and commanded two boats called "The Raven" and "The Swan". His second in command was a 22-year-old Scotsman named Bennett G. Burley. Beall was captured in November, 1863, and was jailed at Fort McHenry, in Baltimore until he was exchanged on May 5, 1864.
On his release, he returned to the north shore of Lake Erie, to Canada West, part of the Province of Canada, in order to implement a plan to free Confederate prisoners on Johnson's Island. On September 18, 1864, a small group of volunteers embarked from Sandwich and Amherstburg, Canada West, and, with Beall, captured the ship "Philo Parsons" off Kelley's Island, and then the "Island Queen", which was scuttled. The plan included capturing the U.S. gunboat "Michigan". However, at this point the crew refused to proceed further without outside assistance. Beall reluctantly agreed, and together they sailed back to Sandwich (the former name of and now a neighborhood of Windsor, Ontario), where they scuttled the "Philo Parsons" and separated, all escaping arrest except for Bennett G. Burley, whose extradition was demanded by U.S. authorities.
Beall then decided to free some captured Confederate officers by derailing a passenger train, but he and a companion, George S. Anderson, were arrested in Niagara, New York, on December 16, 1864. They were imprisoned at Fort Lafayette, New York. Anderson agreed to testify against Beall in return for leniency. 
General John Adams Dix ordered a military commission for Beall's trial, which began on January 17, 1865. He was represented by James T. Brady. The arrest of Beall had not been published in any newspaper, and Confederate authorities were unaware of his status. On February 8, the commission found him guilty on all charges and sentenced him to death. Beall was then transported to and held at Fort Columbus on Governors Island in New York Harbor to await his execution.
The story of Beall's arrest and trial then appeared in the newspapers, and efforts were made to save him. Appeals were made to the President by many prominent people, including six U.S. Senators and ninety-one members of Congress, but Lincoln refused to intervene, not wanting to undermine Dix's authority, and Beall was executed on February 24, 1865.
There is a legend discussed by Lloyd Lewis that Lincoln was approached by John Wilkes Booth, who was a friend of Beall's, to save his life, and that the President agreed to do so. But Lincoln changed his mind (the legend goes) when he was approached by his friend and Secretary of State William Henry Seward, who insisted that Beall's activities had been dangerous to the citizens of New York State (Seward's state). Supposedly a furious Booth determined to kill Lincoln and Seward for this betrayal after Beall was executed.

According to "The New York Times", following Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Jarrah was jailed and then recruited as an intelligence asset by Israeli officers in 1983. As part of his work he photographed Hezbollah supply routes, and traveled throughout Lebanon and Syria. He communicated his information by satellite phone, and even made several trips to Israel on an Israeli passport obtained in Belgium or Italy. Paid by means of dead drops, Jarrah is reported to have received in excess of US$300,000 over the years.

Ypsilanti District Library

The Ypsilanti District Library is a library that serves Ypsilanti, Ypsilanti Township, and Superior Township in eastern Washtenaw County, Michigan, with a permanent branch in each municipality, as well as a bookmobile that travels throughout the service area. The main location is at 5577 Whittaker Road in Ypsilanti Township, the downtown branch (formerly the main location) is at 229 West Michigan Avenue, and a third branch is at 8975 MacArthur Boulevard in Superior Township. The library has been in operation since 1868, and presently has more than 309,000 volumes.
History.
Early history.
In 1868, a small group of women started a reading group that created a library, which originally included 175 volumes. They housed the library on the second floor of the Arcade Building on North Huron. In 1886, the Arcade Building became inadequate for the purpose and the library moved to the second floor on the Union Block on Michigan Avenue. In 1890, Mrs. Starkweather donated her home to the 'Ladies' Library' on Huron Street as well as new furniture and a large stained glass window. In the fall of 1948 the Ladies' Library changed its name to 'Public Library'. In 1963, it moved into a 1915 Beaux Arts building that had previously housed the Ypsilanti post office at 229 West Michigan Avenue, which has been in use ever since.
Recent history.
In 1981 a new bookmobile was purchased and scheduled to start on April 1, 1981. A year later the library was denied extra funds by the township to help with the operating of the library. On March 25, 1983 the library closed due to lack of funds and waited on a tax proposal to be passed on April 4. On June 15, 1983 the library was mandated to reopen when the new tax was voted in. On April 14, 1984 the deed of the library was signed over from the city to the library, so it owned the building. In 1991 the Superior branch was opened. In 1996 Round Tree branch was opened. Due to financial setback, this branch closed again the same year. In 1998 the community voted to build a new library, renovate the Michigan Avenue facility and purchase a new bookmobile. In 2002 the Whittaker Road branch opened. The following year the Michigan Avenue branch was reopened after extensive renovation. The Ypsilanti District Library received the John Cotton Dana Library Public Relations Award for its second annual Ypsilanti Songwriting Festival.
Administration.
Members of the Board of Trustees are elected at large from the library district to serve 4-year terms. Each member is expected to participate in library meetings and the events of the library. The Board of Trustees includes President Suzanne Gray, Vice President Brian Steimel, Treasurer Kay Williams, Secretary Jean Winborn, Director Jill Morey and trustees Frances Doe, Linda Gurka, and Angela Moloney.
Collections.
All of these publications can be checked out by the public at no cost.
Services.
The library provides many services including a bookmobile, inter-library loans, tax forms, photocopies, lively arts programs, community rooms and internet access. The library currently offers the ability to check out free passes to area museums including the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the Arab American National Museum, Cranbrook Educational Community, and the Ypsilanti Historical Museum. The library also offers online book clubs, teen literacy activities, computer classes, and group book discussion.

David Gobel (born 1952, Baltimore, Maryland) is an American author, CEO, entrepreneur, inventor, and futurist.
Career.
David Gobel is Chief Executive Officer of the Methuselah Foundation. Working with Dr. Aubrey de Grey, he founded the original non-profit in 2000 which became the Methuselah Foundation, in an effort to reverse or preempt the damage of aging. Gobel legally established the charity and seed funded the Methuselah Mouse Prize. Currently, there are eight world-class teams competing for the Methuselah Mouse Prize.
Gobel and Dr. Aubrey de Grey established research programs focused on advanced human bioremedial biology at Rice University and Arizona State University bioremediation labs. This is the world's first use of environmental remediation techniques to be directed at reversing "pollution" in human cells. They also established Mitochondrial Research initiative at Cambridge University UK aimed at improving the error correction and repair capabilities of these fundamental energy producing organelles in humans. Additionally, Gobel co-founded the Super Centenarian Research Foundation which is focused on the scientific study of the 65 individuals in the world known to be 110 years or older, and the Institute for Biomedical Gerontology.

Osa (handgun)

OSA (, "wasp") is a family of Russian non-lethal pistols that can be also used as flare gun, flashbang gun or starting pistol. The system consists of the gun (2-4 cartridges, laser target pointer, electronic ignition capsule), and various ammunition types.
OSA was developed in the 1990s by engineer-constructor and weapon designer G.A. Bideev ("Г.А. Бидеев"). It was designed and is manufactured by state owned organizations "Federal Center for Research and Manufacturing" and The Institute for Science and Research in the Applied Chemistry. The pistol is available on the civil market.
Design details.
The PB-4 is a four-barreled break-action gun of original design. It has two horizontal "8"-shaped chambers in its aluminum chambers block, each housing two rounds. There is no need for separated chamber for each round, because gas pressure is contained within thick cylindrical case (external case diameter is 18mm while bullet caliber is 15.3mm), thus chamber support is not needed. Would the round be unlawfully redesigned to increase its power, this will prevent normal use of the gun. The case also performs the function of the barrel, with the bullet positioned deep inside and accelerating within the case. The front end of the case is in level with front end of the chamber block when in firing position. There is a four-fingered extractor in the central channel of the chamber block. Cases are rimless and have an extractor groove. Extractor keeps cases from falling forward outside of chamber block. When action is opened, cases are extracted backwards for manual reloading. The trigger and trigger guard are fixed to lower side of the chambers block.
Chamber block is locked to the handle block with locking surface, firing button (pushed by trigger when chamber block is locked), pistol grip, battery and electronics. Primers are ignited electrically, so there are four circular contact plates on the locking surface (contacting with case bottom) and four contact pins in the center of each plate (contacting with primer). On the trigger pull an impulse is generated. Electronic firing mechanism is able to send firing impulses in sequence to the chambers from 1 to 4 and to skip chambers with malfunctioning rounds to avoid misfires. Weapon is only capable of single-shot firing mode. There are different modifications of PB-4, on some firing mechanism is fed by a battery, on others - by a sort of muscular generator similar with kitchen spark device (a spring is compressed during the trigger pull and electrical impulse is generated by its release).
There is a simple sight assembly atop the chamber block - a semi-cylindrical groove along it and white forward post at the front end of the groove. Some variants of PB-4 have built-in laser sight with laser window in the center of the "locking surface" and the beam following central extractor channel of the chamber block. Laser switch on the left side of the handle block is operated by the thumb. Laser is fed by a battery inside the pistol grip. There are no safety switches - locked and loaded weapon is always ready to fire (for some modifications battery should be live, though)
Non-lethality.
A person shot from about 1 meter with an 18x45T OSA pistol to the temporal region of the head suffered a penetrative injury, with the bullet traversing most of the brain, reducing the victim to a vegetative state.
Cartridges.
A set of «OSA» consists of several types of cartridges, intended for self-defense (and traumatic light-and-sound) and illumination. 
The pistol launcher itself generates an electric pulse to ignite the gunpowder charge.

Steyr M1912

The Steyr M1912 is a semi-automatic pistol developed in 1911 by the Austrian firm Steyr Mannlicher and designed by Karl Krnka, based on the mechanism of the Roth-Steyr M1907. It was developed for the Austro-Hungarian Army and adopted in 1912 as the M1912. It was in service in a limited capacity for the Wehrmacht until the end of World War II.
The Steyr M1912 is usually known as the Steyr-Hahn (Steyr-Hammer). Ostensibly this is because of its external hammer but contemporary designs and indeed earlier Steyr designs also used an external hammer, so this is open to debate.
The M1912 was originally chambered for the 9mm Steyr round, but after the annexation of Austria by Germany in 1938 the M1912 was taken into Wehrmacht service and about 60,000 were rechambered in 9mm Parabellum and remained in service until the end of the war.
History.
The M1912 was developed as the Model 1911 as a military weapon, but it was not accepted until 1914 as the M12. It was originally issued to the Austrian Landwehr while common army units were issued Roth-Steyr M1907 handguns and Rast-Gasser M1898 revolvers. Orders were also placed by Chile and Romania. During World War I, Austria-Hungary experienced shortages of handguns and production of the M1912 was increased. Germany also placed an order for 10,000 pieces (not to be confused with the later incorporation of the M1912 by the Wehrmacht in World War II), chambered for 9mm Steyr cartridge.
After World War I, a commercial model (The Steyr M1911) was produced and was quite popular with army officers, but Steyr had to rely on foreign exports to sustain production. After the annexation of Austria by Germany, the Wehrmacht placed a small order (60,000+) chambered in 9mm Parabellum. In German service, its official designation was 9mm P12(Ö)('Ö' for "Österreichische", "Austrian"). Pistols in Wehrmacht service were distinguished by the 08 stamp on the slide and the "Wehrmachtadler" ("Wehrmacht Eagle") emblem above the trigger.
The M1912 is a dependable and consistent performer, its operating system generally of good quality was able to endure the filthy conditions of trench warfare during World War I without much cause for concern.
Design details.
The Steyr M1912 handgun is operated by a system of short recoil, the barrel unlocking from the slide by rotation. As the pistol is being fired and the recoil of the pistol is in motion, a lug and groove system around the barrel rotate the barrel 20° until a lug hits a stop wedge and holds the barrel while the slide is free to continue its rearward travel, the extractor claw withdrawing the spent casing against the breech face of the slide until the casing strikes the ejector and departs the weapon via the ejection and loading port. Shortly after ejection the slide's rearward travel is arrested by the compressed recoil spring and the abutment of mated surfaces of the slide and frame. The recoil spring is now free to return its stored energy to the cycle of the weapon by beginning to return the slide forward.
As the return spring returns the slide forward, the breech face strips a round from the magazine into the chamber and the locking system engages the barrel and locks it with the slide in the battery position. A safety lever on the left side of the frame can be engaged by turning it into a notch on the slide to immobilize the slide. A disconnector system will also prevent the weapon from firing until the whole action is fully closed.
Although the magazine is situated in the grip, it is integral with the weapon and is loaded from above using eight-round stripper clips. To load, the slide is pulled back to expose the action, the clip is inserted along the guides and the rounds pushed into the magazine.The metal strip is then discarded.
As with the majority of pistols with integral magazines, a lever can be used disengage the magazine catch in order to eject the magazine load.
Doppelpistole M.12 doubled machinegun.
A dual mount stock was also available that converted the M1912 into a double barrel submachine gun known as the Doppelpistole M.12.

Fort Graham

Fort Graham was a pioneer fort established in 1849 by Brevet Major R.A. Arnold (Companies F and I of the Second United States Dragoons) at the site of Jose Maria Village, an Anadaca camp on the western edge of present day Hill County, Texas. It remained in service until 1853, when settlements had moved further west. It was named after Col. William M. Graham, who died at the Battle of Molina del Rey.
A line of seven army posts were established in 1848-49 after the Mexican War to protect the settlers of West Texas and included Fort Worth, Fort Graham, Fort Gates, Fort Croghan, Fort Martin Scott, Fort Lincoln and Fort Duncan.
Reconstruction.
In 1936, the Texas Centennial Commission granted Hill County $6700 to purchase the land upon which the Fort stood and reconstruct one of the buildings.
US Army Corps of Engineers and Lake Whitney.
In 1953, the US Army Corps of Engineers took the fort site as part of the Lake Whitney project. Dr. S. Alan Skinner published, in 1974, "An Evaluation of the Archaeological Resources at Lake Whitney, Texas", Southern Methodist University contributions in anthropology No. 14. The Corps, in accordance with the 1936 dedication, operated a park on the site until 1982 at which time Hill County was forced to enter into a lease for the property or lose this culturally significant resource.
Preservation.
In 1983, a group of local citizens led by Mrs. Selma Hill raised $15,000 to move the building, determined that the fort be preserved. At this time, the building was only three years from being eligible for the National Register on its own merits, however the citizens were never informed of this. Had it achieved National Register status the Corps would have been forced to take preservative action.
The citizens of the County continued to maintain the site until 2002 when the Corps came before the County demanding that a minimum of $60,000 be spent for the revitalization of the area. Hill County did not have sufficient funds, and thus relinquished the lease.
Fort Graham Preservation Society.
The Fort Graham Preservation Society, Inc (FGPS). is a non-profit corporation established to ensure that the memory of Fort Graham is not lost. FGPS is currently working with Federal and County agencies to preserve and revitalize Fort Graham Park and archeological site.

Trolleybuses in Quito

The Quito trolleybus system is a bus rapid transit line located in Quito, Ecuador, which opened in 1995 and by 2002 was carrying approximately 220,000 passengers per day. It is managed by an agency of the municipality known as Empresa Metropolitana de Servicios y Administración del Transporte (EMSAT) and is operated by Compañía Trolebús Quito, S.A. The service is named (informally) "El Trole", Spanish for "The Trolley", meaning trolleybus; this name is shown on signage at stops, and is used in publicity and marketing. Before being a subsystem of a larger bus rapid transit system of Quito known as MetrobusQ, "El Trole" was itself a whole system. Its formal name is Corredor Trole or; simply "Trole", currently.
The route.
The trolleybus system is composed of a single 18.7-km line that runs, with a few exceptions, through the part of Ecuador Highway 35 (E 35) that is within Quito. The three segments of E 35 inside Quito are Avenida Diez de Agosto (northern Quito), Calle Guayaquil (center of Quito) and Avenida Pedro Vicente Maldonado (south of Quito). Seven different passenger services, or "circuitos", are operated along the trolleybus route, differing in their terminus locations but overlapping one another.
The initial 11.2-km line opened in three stages between 17 December 1995 and 21 April 1996, and connected the "La "Y"" district, in northern Quito and near Mariscal Sucre International Airport, to the El Recreo shopping mall (Centro Comercial El Recreo), in southern Quito, via the city center. On 30 April 2000, the line was extended south by 5 km to Morán Valverde. On 19 December 2008, it was extended farther south and east, by 2.5 km, to Quitumbe, where it terminates at a large new intercity-bus station. This latest extension brought the length of the full line to 18.7 km.
Between the Machángara River and the Villa Flora stop, the line originally followed separate streets in opposite directions: southbound along Avenida Cardenal Carlos Maria de la Torre and northbound along Avenida Maldonado, but the section along Cardenal de la Torre was closed in 2003, and the route thereafter has followed Avenida Maldonado in both directions along that section.
Operation.
Service is provided by a fleet of 113 articulated trolleybuses, built by Hispano Carrocera and Mercedes-Benz, with electrical equipment by Vossloh-Kiepe and AEG/Adtranz. For the first phase, 54 vehicles were delivered in 1995-96. Another 59 very similar vehicles were delivered in 1999-2000 for the system's expansion. 
The line operates in dedicated trolleybus-only lanes over almost its entire length, and the trolleybuses are given traffic-signal priority at most intersections. Large terminals, called "Estaciones", are located at the line's two original termini, Estación Norte La "Y" and Estación Sur El Recreo, and also at Morán Valverde and Quitumbe. In between these large terminals are many smaller stations, known as "paradas" (or "stops"), spaced about 550 meters apart, on average. In addition to the traffic separation and signal priority, other features of "El Trole" intended to facilitate fast service—and making the operation similar to many light rail lines—include the arrangements at stops:
The scheduled service frequency is very high at most times, over most of the line, with the headways/intervals being as short as 60 seconds during peak periods. All four of the major "Estaciones" (transfer terminals) are served by several suburban bus routes, "feeding" the trolleybus line, and transfers made there are free.
The original operator of "El Trole" was a department of the municipal government known as Unidad Operadora del Sistema Trolebús (UOST), but around March 2008 operation was transferred to Compañía Trolebús Quito S.A., a newly formed private company that is believed to be still municipally owned.

Irreligion in New Zealand

Irreligion —the absence of religious belief or affiliation— is an increasing trend in New Zealand. Although New Zealand has no established religion, Christianity has been the majority religious affiliation since European settlement in the 19th century. The trend toward irreligion may indicate increasing secularisation as well as a rise in non-institutional spiritual belief.
Demographics.
Statistics New Zealand gathers information on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law for every person in New Zealand on census night but respondents are able to object to answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion increased steadily to 34.7% in the 2006 census. Furthermore, 43% of young people aged between 0–14 years claimed no religion, compared to 11.8% of people aged over 65 years.
There is significant debate among sociologists about the interpretation of this trend in census data. The increase in those indicating 'no religion' is often cited in support of the secularisation thesis, although more detailed research of this group has thrown this assumption into question. An alternative theory is that the data indicates a decline in institutional religious affiliation rather than simply a decrease in spiritual belief. A 1985 survey showed that around one-quarter of those answering 'no religion' may believe in a God.
The International Social Survey Programme was conducted in New Zealand by Massey University in 2008. It received mail-responses from around one thousand New Zealanders above the age of 18, surveying issues of religious belief and practice. The results of this survey indicated that 72% of the population believe in God or a higher power, 15% are agnostic, and 13% are atheist (with a 3% margin of error).
According to a report by the American Physical Society, religion may die out in New Zealand and eight other Western world countries. Associate Professor of History at Massey University Peter Lineham, predicts those who have no religious affiliation will have reached over 50% by the next census.
According to journalist and commentator Ian Harris, Christians could drop below 50% for the first time since the 1840s by the 2013 census.
If current trends persist, those stating no religion will outnumber those who state a religious affiliation by the 2026 census.
Irreligion in society.
The New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists and the Humanist Society of New Zealand promote a secular view of life without reference to supernatural agencies as one of its aims.
A campaign to create advertisements similar to the Atheist Bus Campaign in the United Kingdom began a fund-raising drive on 10 December 2009, and reached its initial target of $10,000 in donations within 48 hours, making it one of the most successful atheist campaigns of all time.

Cariboo River

The Cariboo River is a tributary of the Quesnel River, one of the main tributaries of the Fraser River, in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It flows through the Cariboo region of the British Columbia Interior, southeast of Prince George. Above Cariboo Lake it was formerly known as the Swamp River. The name was adopted, and replaced the former names, in 1936 in association with Cariboo Lake.
Course.
The Cariboo River's headwaters flow from many large ice fields in the Cariboo Mountains. It flows generally west, picking up numerous tributary streams, many also draining ice fields. After entering Bowron Lake Provincial Park, the Cariboo is joined by the Isaac River from the north, after which the Cariboo widens into Lanezi Lake, south of the Mowdish Range. At its western end Lanezi Lake empties into Sandy Lake, from which the Cariboo River flows first northwest, then abruptly south. It leaves Bowron Lake Provincial Park. The Matthew River then joins from the east. Farther south the Little River also joins from the east, after which the Cariboo River flows through Cariboo Lake. Cariboo River Provincial Park occupies the river valley north of Cariboo Lake. The Cariboo River flows south from Cariboo Lake, then turns west and empties into the Quesnel River at Quesnel Forks, northwest of Likely.

SIG MKMO submachine-gun

The SIG MKMO sub-machine gun was designed by Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) company in Neuhausen during the early 1930s and was first introduced in 1933. It was designed for the military and to increase firepower it had a larger capacity magazine as well as a longer barrel, one that would be more common on an assault rifle. Only 1,228 of these guns were produced. It saw limited adoption by Swiss police departments and the Swiss Guard at the Vatican. Finland purchased approximately 282 of the MKMS variant, which were used by the home guard, supply units and coastal defense forces in the Continuation War.
Design.
The SIG MKMO made use of an ingenious delayed blowback action which kept the cartridge within the chamber long enough for the pressure within the barrel to decrease to a safe level. The delayed blowback action was made up of a two-part bolt which was designed by Gotthard End. It was also the first ever personal weapon to have a folding magazine so the longer than usual magazine could be stored horizontally within the wooden stock. This made transportation during non-combat movement easy and much less difficult compared to some guns without folding magazines, yet when trouble did arise, a simple catch system would release the magazine allowing normal firing to commence.
Delayed blowback action.
The locked-breech blowback system mirrored that of John Pedersen's Remington Model 51 only with a locking recess above rather than below the bolt. The longer barrel of the MKMO required either a bolt of greater mass or a locking system. When the firearm is in battery, the breech block rests slightly forward of the locking shoulder in the frame. When the cartridge is fired, the breech block and bolt carrier move together a short distance rearward powered by the energy of the cartridge as in a standard blowback system. When the breech block contacts the locking shoulder, it stops, locking the breech. The bolt carrier continues rearward with the momentum it acquired in the initial phase. This delay allows chamber pressure to drop to safe levels while the breech is locked and the cartridge slightly extracted. Once the bullet leaves the barrel and pressure drops, the continuing motion of the bolt carrier cams the breech block from its locking recess, continuing the operating cycle.
Other features.
There was no fire selector switch for single or automatic fire. This was gauged by the force of pull on the trigger. A short pull was for single shot and a long pull was for automatic fire. This was also one of the first sub-machine guns that had an integral dust cover on the magazine housing.
Variants.
There were 3 variants of the MKMO. There was the shortened barreled MKPO which still used the overly complicated two-part delayed blowback action. This was designed for the police market. In 1935, SIG then created the MKMS and the MKPS. The MKMS had the long barrel of the MKMS but had a more conventional single-part blowback action while the MKPS had the shortened barrel as well as the single-part bolt blowback action. Both also fired from open bolt manual safety which was located on the left side of receiver.
Specifications of MKPO
Both MKMO and MKPO submachine guns were somewhat complicated and made to extremely high standards, so the price was high and sales were low and thus production was stopped in 1941.
Sighting flaws.
The sights for both the MKMO and MKPO were both fully manually adjustable but could be calibrated from 100 metres to an optimistic 1000 metres. This led to much confusion with accuracy often found wanting in young soldiers who couldn't operate the sights properly.

SR-2 Veresk

The SR-2 Veresk ("СР-2 Вереск", Russian for "heather") is a Russian submachine gun.
History.
Development of a new submachine gun chambered for the 9x21 mm cartridge (also used by the SR-1 "Gyurza" pistol) was launched in mid-1990s on the order of the FSB. A weapon was presented in 1999, developed in Klimovsk TsNIITochMash which received the designation of SR-2 (Spetsialnaya Razarbotka - 2, Special Development - 2) and nicknamed "Veresk" ("Heather", a plant).
"Veresk" and its round were created as a compact weapon capable of engaging enemies wearing Russian class-II body armor (able to stop ordinary pistol bullets, such as 9x19 Para and 7.62x25 Tokarev), and soft-skinned vehicles, at distances up to 200 metres.
Features.
The SR-2 "Veresk" differs from most SMGs by its gas-operated action with rotating bolt, typically used in assault rifles (normally SMGs utilise different blowback principles). This design is partially borrowed from the SR-3 "Vikhr" compact assault rifle. Externally the "Veresk" is similar to the Uzi; 20- or 30-round magazines are inserted into the pistol grip. There are two AK-style control levers on both sides of the receiver: the right one is the safety switch, the left is a fire-mode selector. The cocking handle is on the right side and is fixed to the bolt carrier, so it moves during firing. There is a mount for a "red dot" sight on top of the receiver (unlike the AK-style side rail). The weapon has an upwards-folding metal stock. 
An SR-2M modified version also has a forward pistol grip under the handguard, with a protrusion to protect the shooter's hand from muzzle blast and accidents (similar to the grip on the MP5K). The SR-2M stock can be fully folded even with "red dot" sight installed.

Tokarev Model 1927

The Tokarev Model 1927 submachine gun was an experimental firearm developed in the Soviet Union under the leadership of Fedor Vasilievich Tokarev.
Owing to ammo supply problems, in 1924 the Soviet leadership decided to abandon all weapons using foreign ammunition. As a consequence, production of the Fedorov Avtomat was halted in 1925 and subsequently it would be withdrawn from service by 1928.
In 1925 the Soviet Army commission for weapons decided that submachineguns should be introduced into army service, initially as offensive weapons for low-ranking officers. Consequently a contest was started next year for such weapons. Tokarev, who was familiar with Fedorov's work, decided to take up the challenge of producing a suitable substitute weapon that would work with permissible ammunition. This resulted in the first Soviet-made submachine gun using the 7.62 x 38mm Nagant revolver round, because at the time there was no Soviet automatic pistol round accepted for army use.
The 1927 Tokarev is a blowback-operated weapon, capable of selective fire, which is achieved by using two triggers. The rear trigger fired a single shot, while the front trigger was for fully automatic fire. The butt of the gun has a storage cavity for an additional magazine. The guns is sighted for 100 or 200 meters by flipping up one of the two peephole sights on the receiver. A carabine prototype was also produced; it has a single trigger, slightly longer barrel, and adjustable sights up to 800 meters, despite using the same weak cartridge; an exemplar of both variants can now be found at the Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps in Saint Petersburg.
Only a handful of these submachineguns had been ordered for trial purposes, when in July 1928 the Soviet Army leadership decided that a single new automatic cartridge should be developed for both automatic pistols and submachine guns, to be obtained by modifying the 7.63×25mm Mauser round down to the Soviet machinery standard of 7.62 mm. Tokarev had to adapt his design to this new ammunition. By then, the competition had been joined by designs from Degtyarev and Korovin, who designed their weapons directly for the new round. Trials were conducted in July 1930, pitted Tokarev models chambered for both rounds against these other two domestic competitors. The Army commission was rather dissatisfied with all guns presented at this trial. Eventually, in Feb 1931, the army ordered 500 Tokarevs chambered in the revolver round, to be sent to the troops for more extensive trials. The feedback received from the troops was apparently negative. The number of Tokarev submachineguns (chambered in the Nagant round) actually produced and delivered remains uncertain.
Between 1932 and 1933 yet more trials were held, with 14 different submachine gun samples from Tokarev, Degtyarev, Korovin, Prilutsk and Kolesnikov. The army commission eliminated the guns of Korovin, Prilutsk and Kolesnikov as unsatisfactory due to their unreliable cycling. Ultimately it was a showdown between Degtyarev and Tokarev's gun, but except for weight, Degtyarev's model proved superior in all other departments: accuracy, muzzle velocity, a lower rate of fire (as desired by the army), ease of handling and reliability. Degtyarev's model eventually was commissioned in 1935 as the PPD-34.

Empresa de Ferrocarriles Ecuatorianos

The Ferrocarriles del Ecuador Empresa Publica (FE EP) (Ecuadorian Railways Company) is the national railway of Ecuador. The railway system was devised to connect the Pacific coast with the Andean highlands. After many decades of service the railway was severely damaged by the El Niño in 1997 and 1998 and general neglect. 
In 2008 the president Rafael Correa named the railroad a "national cultural patrimony" and indicated that it would be restored. The government of Ecuador started to rehabilitate the railway and service was restored between Guayaquil and Quito by 2013.
Tourist trains and railbusses (autoferros) are running from Quito via Cotopaxi national park to Latacunga, between Alausi to Sibambe (Devil's Nose / Nariz del Diablo), between El Tambo and Baños del Inca, between Duran and Yaguachi and between Ibarra and Salinas.
Construction.
The project of an Ecuadorian railway was started by President Gabriel García Moreno in 1861. The first section was opened between Durán and Milagro in 1873, and Bucay was reached by 1888.
The push into the Andes was made under President Eloy Alfaro who planned to link Quito in the highlands to Guayaquil on the coast of Ecuador. For advice, Alfaro turned to Col. William Findlay Shunk, a well-known North American engineer who designed the New York El, and who had mapped a route of the InterContinental Railway (which was to connect North and South America) through Ecuador, Colombia, and Panama in 1892. The InterContinental Railway was never built. However, in 1897, Eloy Alfaro commissioned a contract with Archer Harman and a team of investors for the newly created New Jersey corporation, "the Guayaquil and Quito Railway Company," "or the G&Q, to rehabilitate and complete the railroad from Guayaquil to Quito. Archer Harman and his brother, Major John A. Harman (Col. Shunk's son-in-law) were from Staunton, Virginia. Together, Archer (G&Q financier) and John (G&Q Chief Engineer) helped Alfaro to (1) realize his dream of connecting disparate parts of Ecuador, (2) break the hold of the Catholic Church, and (3) usher the 20th Century and modernity into Ecuador."
The G&Q Rwy line was built between 1897 and 1908, when the line reached Quito amidst celebration that lasted for days, and shortened the often lengthy trip from Quito to Guayaquil to two days.
The G&Q Rwy line evolved into the Southern Division (Division Sur) of Empresa de Ferrocarriles Ecuatorianos (EFE).
Operation.
The railway represents the largest infrastructure of the country with a total length of . Its single track uses a gauge of . The Southern Division (Division Sur) starts at the habour of Guayaquil with a ferry to Duran and then heads east into the Andean mountains where a more than difference in altitude has to be overcome to reach Riobamba at . A major gain in altitude is made at the Devil's Nose (Nariz del Diablo) where the train shunts back and forth along the rocky promontory. From Riobamba the train heads north passing its highest point at Urbina an altitude of to reach Quito at an altitude of .
The Northern Division (Division Norte) was completed in 1957. It connects Quito to the northern sea port of San Lorenzo over Ibarra, Primer Paso and Cachavi.
The Cuenca line branches off near Sibambe and represents the Subdivision Sur. It was constructed between 1915 and 1965.
The railway used to be of general economic significance for many decades. Initially steam engines were obtained from the Baldwin Locomotive Works. The last set of 2-8-0 steam engines were obtained in 1953. In 1957 the first Alstom diesel-electric engines were delivered, later engines were delivered in 1968, and again in 1992. The last delivery consisted of Alstoms AD24 BBB with the numbers 2401-9.
Few steam and diesel engines are in an operational mode and numbers of availability conflict. Also a number of railbusses (autoferros) are part of EFE.
Demise.
Since the 1997/98 disruptions no continuous service has been conducted and further degradation has made the railway almost useless. Road services have taken over passenger and freight transportation in Ecuador. At the 2008 centennial only 10 percent of the railway was open only tourist trains remain active.
Restoration.
In 2008 the president Rafael Correa named the railroad a "national cultural patrimony" and indicated that it would be restored. The EFE was transformed in a public corporation: Ferrocarriles del Ecuador Empresa Publica (FEEP) The first section which was reopened, was from Riobamba to Urbina(1:see table), which now is only used for charter service. In 2009 a small section of the side branch to Cuenca from El Tambo to Baños del Inca(2) was reopened. In 2010 the Quito - Latacunga(3) - Section restarted service after restoration. At the coast the section between Duran near Guayaquil and Yaguachi(4) was reopened in 2010. Also the section Alausí - Sibambe(5) which entails the switchback at the Devil's Nose was repaired by 2011.
The section Riobamba - Alausí(6) and the section Riobamba - Urbina - Ambato(7) were restored in 2011. According to a contract the Spanish narrow gauge railway company FEVE three of the Alstoms AD24 BBB will be repaired in Spain.
By 2013 the Guayaquil/Duran - Quito railway was restored and open to the public.

Kedahan Malay

Kedahan Malay is one of the largest Malay subgroup. They are among the earliest settler in Malay Peninsular. This group comprised at least 15% of the total ethnic Malay population.
History.
According to history, Kedah was very popular among Arabian traders. Thus, this has led to interracial marriages between Arabs and Malays. Due to Arabic influences in the Kedahan Malay language, some Kedahan Malay are of Arab descent. However some of the Kedahan Malays that resided on the island-state of Penang might have Indian blood and some who lived in Thailand might have Thai blood.
Kedah Valley.
Kedah Valley is an area where the majority inhabitants are Kedahan Malays. The valley covered the Satun province of Thailand and the three northern states of Malaysia (Perlis, Kedah, Pulau Pinang) with at least an area of 25,908 km square.
Demonym.
Nowadays, most Kedahan Malays known themselves as "Orang Utara" or People Of The Northern Region instead of Kedahan Malay since that they resided the northern part of Peninsular Malaysia. So are their language, which is called "Pelat Utara" or Northern Dialect.
Dialect.
Kedahan Malay dialect can be divided into several subdialects, namely Kedah Persisiran (standard), Baling or Kedah Hulu, Kedah Utara, Perlis-Langkawi, Penang and some others (outside Malaysia). For instance instead of using 'kamu' to denote as 'you', 'hang' (hung - English pronunciation) is used.
Customs and culture.
Kedahan Malay shares the same customs and traditions with other Malay in Peninsular Malaysia. The only thing that make them different is just their spoken dialect. Their own cultures included:
Boria
The most famous Kedahan culture of Indian origin. It is quite similar to a musical theater. The theater used a fully Kedahan Malay language while the song used a mix of standard Malay and Kedahan accent or sometimes, a fully standard Malay. This theater is said to be created after the hybrid of Malay and Indian culture in Penang.
Silat Kuntau Tekpi
Silat Kuntau Tekpi was founded by Panglima Taib bin Wan Hussain who was a Panglima (Palace Warrior-General) of the empire of Kedah. It is also a 'sister-art' of silat styles that stemmed from Panglima Tok Rashid, including Silat Kalimah and Silat Cekak.
Silat Cekak[http://melayuonline.com/culture/?a=VHVUei9zVEkvUXZ5bEpwRnNx=]
Silat Cekak was founded by Ustaz Hanafi, a Kedahan Malay but now, it is popular throughout Malaysia and some place in Indonesia.

Bill 'Joe' Bushell (born 14 August 1891) was an Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL), Sturt in the South Australian Football League (SAFL) as well as both North Fremantle and Subiaco in the West Australian Football League (WAFL).
Bushell, a defender, started his career at North Fremantle and was part of the Western Australian squad which competed in the 1908 Melbourne Carnival. While away, Bushell was recruited to Sturt by their secretary and he spent 1908 playing with the club, in South Australia. He then transferred to St Kilda, debuting in the sixth round of the 1910 VFL season, against Richmond at Junction Oval. St Kilda lost the match by 13 points and it would be Bushell's only appearance in the league, as he returned to his home state at the year's end.
Known by his nickname 'Joe', Bushell resurrected his career at Subiaco where his brother Harry played. Used mainly as a half back flanker, Bushell was a member of Subiaco's 1912, 1913 and 1915 premiership teams.

The Cañas-Jerez Treaty between Costa Rica and Nicaragua was enacted April 15, 1858 as a solution to the growing border tension between the two countries. The treaty was negotiated between Máximo Jerez representing Nicaragua and José María Cañas representing Costa Rica. It established a border between the two countries that skirts the southern edge of Lake Nicaragua, then moves east along the San Juan River for the last third of the division, following it north from where it forks from the Rio Colorado. The treaty puts the border on the right bank of the river, giving the river to Nicaragua, but provides commercial navigation rights to Costa Rica.

Javal's rule is a mathematical formula used to estimate astigmatism based on keratometry readings. The estimate is useful for high cylinder measures, generally over -2.00 diopters.
The estimate is found by multiplying the difference in power between the two meridians by 1.25 and factoring in the average lenticular astigmatism, which is -0.50 x 090.

John F. Kennedy Supreme Court candidates

Although he was president for less than three years, John F. Kennedy appointed two men to the Supreme Court of the United States: Byron White and Arthur Goldberg. Given the advanced age of Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter at the time of Kennedy's inauguration, speculation abounded over potential Kennedy nominations to the Supreme Court from the start of his presidency.
Byron White nomination.
Associate Justice Charles Evans Whittaker retired from the Supreme Court (technically taking senior status) in March 1962 after just over five years on the court, citing exhaustion from the workload. The Whittaker retirement gave Kennedy his first vacancy on the Supreme Court.
Two names initially came up as potential nominees: Judge William H. Hastie of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Harvard Law School Professor Paul A. Freund. United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy had recommended Hastie, who would have become the first African-American on the Supreme Court. Robert F. Kennedy said "it would mean so much overseas that we had a Negro on the Supreme Court." However, Hastie was opposed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, who balked because "he's not a liberal and he'll be opposed to all measures we are interested in, and he would be completely unsatisfactory." Associate Justice William O. Douglas also objected to Hastie as the nominee. In addition, President Kennedy's adviser, Ted Sorensen, opposed Hastie because Kennedy was in the process of considering another African-American, Robert C. Weaver, for a cabinet post (Weaver ultimately became the first United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, inviting the charge of reverse racism). Sorensen argued that "the first appointment should be one hailed by all for his judicial mien."
Sorensen recommended Freund as the nominee. However, President Kennedy objected to Freund as the nominee because of Freund's Harvard pedigree (having attended Harvard Law School and having been a professor at Harvard Law School at the time of the Whittaker vacancy), given that there already were a significant number of people connected to Harvard University in the Kennedy administration.
Ultimately, Kennedy selected White, who was a longtime supporter of his and who had been serving as United States Deputy Attorney General. Kennedy formally nominated White to the Supreme Court on April 3, 1962. White was confirmed by the United States Senate just eight days later, on April 11, 1962, in a voice vote.
Arthur Goldberg nomination.
After suffering a stroke, Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter retired (technically taking senior status) from the Supreme Court on August 28, 1962, at the age of 79.
There is not much evidence that Kennedy considered any other candidate other than Goldberg for the vacancy. It had been widely reported that Frankfurter's seat was considered a "Jewish seat" on the Supreme Court (prior to Frankfurter, it had been occupied by another Jewish Justice, Benjamin N. Cardozo), meaning that the president felt significant pressure to appoint a Jew to replace Frankfurter. Kennedy nominated Goldberg, who at that time was United States Secretary of Labor, on August 31, 1962. The United States Senate confirmed Goldberg in a voice vote on September 25, 1962.
Names mentioned.
Following is a list of individuals who were mentioned in various news accounts and books as having been considered by Kennedy for a Supreme Court appointment:

Bill Pitt (racing driver)

William (Bill) Pitt is a former Australian racing driver and motor racing official.
For most of his racing career Pitt was associated with Jaguars, competing with XK120 and D-Type sports cars, a Mark VIII rally car and a Mark 1 touring car with the assistance of Queensland's Jaguar agents Cyril and Geordie Anderson of Westco Motors.
Pitt first became involved in racing as an official at the 1948 Australian Grand Prix, but gradually moved into competing himself. By the mid 1950s he was a front running sports car driver. Pitt co-drove a Jaguar XK120 to a four lap victory in what for 48 years was Australia's only 24 hour motor race, the 1954 Mount Druitt 24 Hours Road Race, driving with Geordie Anderson and Charles Swinburne.
In 1956 Anderson purchased a Jaguar D-Type in which Pitt placed fourth behind two factory-entered Maseratis and a Ferrari in the Australian Tourist Trophy at Albert Park in November of that year. The car was badly damaged the following weekend, but was rebuilt and, with Pitt driving, became the dominant feature of Australian sports car racing. Frequently, because of his domination of sports car racing, Pitt raced the D-Type against Grand Prix type machinery in search of competition, finishing third in the 1957 Queensland Road Racing Championship, a race which counted towards the 1957 Australian Drivers' Championship.
The D-Type was sold in 1959 and Pitt and Anderson next invested in a Jaguar Mark 1 Saloon to race in the growing touring car category. After finishing second behind David McKay in the 1960 Australian Touring Car Championship, Pitt became the first Queenslander to win the title, achieving the victory at his home circuit, Lowood, in 1961.
Pitt retired from racing in 1963 but continued in his role as a Queensland representative of the National Control Council of the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport until 1964.

Stylostome

The stylostome is a funnel or channel-like structure formed by trombiculid mites. The formation is not caused by the mouthparts of the mites, because these mites do not have needle-like mouthparts as other hematophagous animals have been known to have, but have chelicerae, which only pierce the skin. The tube is formed by the digestive enzymes in the saliva, which is the same salivary secretions that break down cells that is causing the surrounding tissue to harden. As the mite feeds longer, the saliva seeps farther down, and digesting more tissue, therefore causes the stylosome to penetrate to lower layers of skin.
Transmission of Disease.
Normally, the bite mark causes local swelling or welts, but in more serious cases cause dermatitis. Though the mite can be infected with a disease called scrub typhus in Asia and the Pacific by carrying saliva directly to the blood stream, but mites in North America have not been known to transmit Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia or any other disease.

Sidetrack Bar &amp; Grill

Sidetrack Bar and Grill is a restaurant on the east end of Depot Town in Ypsilanti, Michigan, at 56 East Cross Street. It is just down the road from Eastern Michigan University and is a popular hangout for students and faculty. Linda French, who has owned the restaurant since 1980, named it after “its unique location alongside the main railroad line from Detroit to Chicago.” The location has served as a restaurant, under different names, as far back as 1850. It has a large beer selection as well as liquor and wine and has won awards for its food.
History.
Names.
Sidetrack Bar and Grill is the current name of the restaurant on the corner of River St. and Cross St. because of its location next to the railroad tracks. Before it was Sidetrack Bar and Grill it was known as Central Bar or “The Central.” The name was from the New York Central Railroad being the owner of the rail line next to Central Bar. New York Central Railroad sold the line to Pennsylvania Railroad which changed the name of the rail line; the Central Bar did not change their name. Christo’s Bar was the name previous to Central Bar because the Christo family was the owners and operators. Pictures of them can be found in the Sidetrack's menu today. From back in the nineteenth century until 1949, Max’s was the moniker of the bar. Most of the patrons were said to be railroad workers not college students and faculty like they are today.
Train Wreck.
Sidetrack’s building has an atypical shape due to a train derailment that happened in 1929. On an early January morning, a freight train moving through Depot Town came off its track and crashed into the corner of what is now Sidetrack Bar and Grill. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured. As a result, she had most of her personnel effects scattered out in the street. There were only a few people near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes.
Post Prohibition.
When prohibition was repealed new laws stated that entrances to bar had to be at least five hundred feet from churches. This caused the entrance to the restaurant changed from the east side of the building to the north side in 1931.The church that was located within the five hundred foot limit, burned down before construction began on the back patio.
Awards.
GQ magazine named Sidetrack’s “Our Famous Burger” one of the "Twenty Hamburgers You Must Eat Before You Die." In the article the magazine said “The closer you come to a college campus, the worse burgers get” and that Sidetrack “is an exception.” 
Oprah Winfrey had a segment on Gayle King’s quest for eating the best burgers in America and according to Sidetrack’s web site the bar and grill is mentioned. Sidetrack’s menu also claims that they were voted second best restaurant outside Ann Arbor four times.
The Betty Anne Waters Story.
Sidetrack Bar and Grill was closed for two days in March 2009 as it was used for location filming for the Hilary Swank film, "Conviction". The film is based on the true story of a working mother who puts herself through law school in order to defend her brother after a wrongful murder conviction.

<doc id="21602549" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21602549" title="St.GIGA">
St.GIGA

Satellite history.
Broadcast between 11 March 1990 and 28 November 2007 St.GIGA has undergone a number of changes of both carrier satellite and broadcast band. The following is a condensed history of these changes:
The St.GIGA concept.
In 1990 the established Japanese satellite television company, WOWOW, decided to expand their services into the field of satellite radio. The core management team made the executive decision to create a subsidiary named St.GIGA. The name was selected by a popular poll of the man on the street because the executives agreed that they knew nothing about music. In deciding who to hire as director for the subsidiary, (who had recently designed the successful J-Wave FM) was selected as an innovator in the field.
Soon after accepting the position, Yokoi crafted a radical proposal for the station concept. The initial reaction at WOWOW was skeptical, however within a few months of traditional satellite radio broadcasts, Yokoi's concept was given probationary adoption, and Yokoi was subsequently given full discretion to shape the company's future.
Yokoi's "Tide of Sound".
Under Hiroshi Yokoi's direction, the St.GIGA station motto became "I'm here. — I'm glad you're there. — We are St.GIGA." This is a reference to Kurt Vonnegut's "The Sirens of Titan" in which the alien life forms called harmoniums communicate using only the phrases "Here I am." and "So glad you are." Strongly influenced by the works of Kurt Vonnegut and Kevin W. Kelley's "The Home Planet", Yokoi's original concept proposal for St.GIGA would break new ground for broadcast communication methodology.
In accordance with Yokoi's conception, St.GIGA's broadcasts initially followed no externally fixed (or artificial) timetable. Rather they were based upon the cyclical motif of a 24-hour "tide table" where broadcast themes were approximately matched to the current tidal cycle according to the rule of twelfths throughout the 24-hour broadcasting period. Under this innovative schedule, the station broadcast a variety of primarily ambient music programs including , various jazz programs, and (featuring live sound-broadcasts of the ocean shore). The beginnings and ends of programs were not clearly demarcated and instead utilized the unprecedented method where songs of one genre would gradually flow into and intersperse with the songs from the prior genre until the new genre became predominant. The intent, according to Yokoi was to allow the listener to relax in a wave of sound "like a baby sleeps in the womb." "Tide of Sounds" broadcasts operated under a principle of "No Commercials, No DJs, No News Broadcasts, No Talk." Unlike most commercial-driven radio broadcasts, this was made possible for St.GIGA due to its reliance on a subscription Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) service. In order to receive this DAB service, the subscriber was required to obtain a special decoder, to pay an initiation fee, and subsequent monthly fees. "Tide of Sounds" broadcasts often took the form of high-quality digital recordings of nature sounds accompanied by spoken word narration by an actor as the "Voice." Throughout the life span of "Tide of Sounds" broadcasts, the part of the "Voice" would be played by a number of notable Japanese poets including Ryo Michiko among others. "Voice" performances often consisted of all new poetry composed specifically for the show.
St.GIGA also broadcast its B-mode audio programming (a series of all classical music broadcasts) over analog broadcasting frequency bands that were shared with its parent, the satellite broadcasting company WOWOW.
Highly artistic and experimental, the St.GIGA sound became extremely popular within certain segments of the population, and the station was recognized for its innovative concept, unique vision, and nonstandard methodology. Fan publications such as "BSFan Journal" and "G-Mania" sprang up to publish details of the music and to report on the ambient, mood, and electronic scene that was burgeoning in Japan. To this day numerous fan groups, trading groups, and collectors with an emphasis on St.GIGA's musical products exist online.
The initial popularity of the music funded trips by St.GIGA biomusic recorders to travel abroad to record at such exotic locations as England, Canary Islands, Mikonos, Venice, Bali, Tahiti, Martinique, Hanson Island (BC), and Maui. St.GIGA was also able to release a number of thematic books including the multi-volume "St.GIGA Stylebook", (containing the full text of Yokoi's original concept proposal), and (also released on VHS). Later thematic films were sold including "Traveling with St.GIGA" (1999) and "Sound and Vision" (2007)
St.GIGA sold a variety of products ranging from program guides to "sound calendars" to fragrances. They also released a number of CDs under St.GIGA's own label as well as a variety of foreign labels such as the Hearts of Space, and music by Deep Forest.
Unfortunately for St.GIGA, the market for ambient music and its related forms was not as strong as initially anticipated, and demand was impacted by Japan's recession. By 1994, the station was beginning to face serious financial difficulties, resulting in drastic changes in programming.
Satellite Data broadcasting.
By 1994, St.GIGA's financial difficulties resulted in the cutting back of "Tide of Sound" broadcasts. Their portion of the subscription-funded audio broadcasts were to be replaced under subcontract by an all new series of advertising-funded Satellite Data broadcasts, managed under the "rescue" and executive control of Nintendo, St.GIGA's largest shareholder at 19.5%.
Beginning on 23 April 1995, St.GIGA broadcast video-game-related data to owners of the Super Famicom's Satellaview peripheral created by Nintendo. This device bolts onto the underside of the Super Famicom in a manner similar to the later Nintendo 64DD's attachment to the Nintendo 64 and the Game Boy Player's attachment to the GameCube. Only released to the Japanese market, the Satellaview acted as a satellite modem, allowing players to download broadcast data. The resulting games were then stored on requisite specialized rewritable storage cartridges at an additional launch price of 14,000 yen ($143).
The broadcast content ranged from video-game-related Satellaview news and specific interest journals such as to expansion data for popular Super Famicom games (including, for example, "Chrono Trigger") and all new video game releases including titles in such flagship series as "The Legend of Zelda", "Super Mario", and "Kirby". Additionally, a number of these broadcasts featured an updated version of St.GIGA's earlier "Tide of Sounds" "Voice," now called , with which St.GIGA voice actors would provide a live vocal track to accompany games, setting plot and describing in-game goals.
Due to the rewritability of the cartridges, the fact that "SoundLink" broadcasts were not downloaded to the game cartridges but rather were streamed live during the noon-2AM "Super Famicom Hour" broadcasting time, and because the broadcast game data has never been re-released by Nintendo, these games have become extremely rare. The subculture of collectors and enthusiasts that has grown online have exerted much effort engaged in electronic archaeology by extracting old data from heavily rewritten data cartridges in order to faithfully reproduce the games via emulation.
Aside from St.GIGA's "SoundLink" or broadcasts accompanying the transmission of data for their , St.GIGA also broadcast a wealth of information on talk shows and celebrity idols, including a variety show. Broadcast times were fitted to match the schedules of students, and the station's audience demographics shifted radically much to the disappointment of the station's former ambient music fans. Before long the station had ceased transmissions of all "Time & Tide" programs (those featuring new age music) including the much-admired , Fan publications such as "BSFan Journal" became replaced by more populist publications like , and St.GIGA focused all energies on Satellaview transmissions.
Satellaview transmissions continued uninterruptedly with only a single recertification between 1995 and April 1999. Carrying a "cumulative debt of 8.8 billion yen" as of March 1998, a Reuters report on 21 August 1998 indicated St.GIGA's rejection of Nintendo's debt management proposal as well as the broadcaster's failure to apply for renewal of its governmental satellite license. This resulted in the withdrawal of Nintendo's five executive staff, and the withdrawal of all current and proposed programming plans by Nintendo, Kyocera, and "many content providers", that had been intended for launch in 2000; though Nintendo's 19.7% ownership portfolio remained intact. St.GIGA continued Satellaview broadcasts after this point; however, they could only broadcast reruns of games previously transmitted as Nintendo had discontinued their supply of new original content as of March 1999. Facing economic difficulties again, St.GIGA discontinued its Satellaview broadcasts on 30 June 2000 in order to return focus to music broadcasts as they had prior to the Nintendo deal.
Later years and current status.
By 2001, St.GIGA was nearly bankrupt and entered into merger talks with with which it became associated for the remainder of its lifespan. On 21 March 2003, following the death by cancer of director Yokoi, St.GIGA was rechristened under the leadership of . Broadcasts continued until 1 October, when the company was forced to sell their licensing rights to World Independent Networks Japan Inc. (WINJ). WireBee immediately began bankruptcy procedures, and all recording instruments and 241 tapes of nature sounds were auctioned off at open market for a total divided sale price of ¥5 million. Discussions concerning Club COSMO's involvement under WINJ's oversight in a new reality show were circulated briefly at this time, however to date no such show has been produced.
In 2006, WINJ began broadcasting reruns of St.GIGA's original "Tide of Sound" and "Time & Tide" broadcasts during a 2PM-4PM time slot, however on 1 November of the same year these broadcasts were suspended on the pretext of broadcasting equipment maintenance. The program was scheduled to resume in the 2007 fiscal year, however on 14 November 2007, the Minister of Internal affairs revoked the broadcasting certificate under Act 54 of Article 24 of the Japanese General Broadcasting Statute.

Cassim Sema

Moulana Cassim Mohammed Sema (12 May 1920 – 9 June 2007) was the founder of the first madrasa in South Africa and possibly the first madrasa that uses English as its medium of instruction. He also played an immense role in the establishment tabligh as well as da'wah among the non-Muslims of South Africa.
Moulana Cassim Mohammed Sema was born in Newcastle, a town in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. At the age of five, he commenced his education at Oswald's School in Newcastle. However, his education was terminated after the completion of standard six. Moulana completed the recitation of the Qur'an and studied Urdu under Moulana Hafiz Shamsuddin. Thereafter, he commenced the memorisation of the Qur'an under Hafiz Aminuddin, under whom he completed seven "ajza". He then memorised two more "ajza" under Moulana Ali Ahmad Ansari. Moulana Mia of Watervaal Institute was an inspiration to Moulana when he visited Newcastle in 1935 and told Moulana to either study medicine or become an 'Alim abroad. Moulana chose to become an 'Alim and departed for India on 23 October 1935. There, he enrolled at Jami'a Islamiyya in Dabhel and completed the "Alimiyya" course. He eventually graduated in August 1942 at the age of twenty-two and decided to return to South Africa, where a post as a teacher awaited him in Mia's Farm. Unfortunately, World War II started and the operation of passenger ships terminated due to the risk of Japanese attacks. However, due to demand, a steamboat called "Tilaawa" was arranged to transport passengers to Africa. On 23 November 1942, it departed from Bombay with 1 000 passengers and 300 crew members. En route, it was attacked by Japanese torpedoes and sank. Moulana and 124 passengers were the only survivors. They were transported back to Bombay. Moulana was then employed by Majlis-e-'Ilmi in Simlak, where he taught Athar al-Sunan. He passed a year in Simlak, preparing his own meals and occasionally leading salaah at the masjid. Moulana left India and arrived in South Africa on 5 February 1944. He received a number of job offers, but accepted the offer from Wasbank. He taught in Wasbank and passed two years in the formulation of a madrasa syllabus.
In 1949, Moulana started to propagate Islam within the African communities of the Msinga Reserve. Over a period of ten years, nine hundred people converted to Islam. On 30 October 1960, the first da'wah "ijtima" was held in Wasbank, after which a building that housed a masjid and madrasa was built in the Makhakhane area. Moulana was part of the first Tablighi Jama'ah of South Africa. In 1961, they travelled to Malawi for the first "ijtima" of southern Africa. He was instrumental in organising the first South African "ijtima" in Ladysmith later in 1961. A few months later, he travelled with the first South African "jama'ah" to India for four months. On his return, he was arrested at the Makhakhane Masjid because he had broken an apartheid law which stated that Indians were not allowed into African areas. He was fined and, for the next ten years, forced to fight for the protection of the Makhakhane Masjid, which the government wanted to destroy. During this period, da'wah and nightly madrasa sessions continued secretly. Then a masjid was established in Tugela Ferry, which the government also wanted to demolish. However, the masjid survived. Also, despite the oppressive laws of apartheid, Moulana regularly preached Islam at the Msinga Reserve. After twenty-three years of service in Wasbank, Moulana returned to Newcastle in 1968, becoming the principal of its madrasa. He lectured every Friday in Urdu, but shifted to English as the younger generation arrived. In 1967, the Jamiatul Ulama Kwazulu Natal met to devise a single madrasa syllabus for the entire province. Moulana's syllabus was chosen. Thereafter, Moulana worked with the Jamiatul Ulama KwaZulu-Natal for a year. He then established a furniture-manufacturing store in Alcockspruit, which was eventually closed due to new industrial laws.
Moulana passed a few months as the principal of the madrasa and imam of the masjid of Glencoe, while negotiations in the purchase of land for a madrasa were finalised. Moulana had been attempting to establish a madrasa with boarding facilities since 1946. Eventually, in 1969, the building that had housed St. Dominics Academy, a Roman Catholic convent, which had been vacant for fifteen years, was bought for R 83 000. Darul Uloom Newcastle was opened on 13 May 1973. Moulana then decided to travel to the Indian subcontinent for a 40-day "jama'ah" before officially establishing the madrasa. In Pakistan, Moulana met his former teacher, Moulana Yusuf Binnori, who devised the curriculum of Darul Uloom Newcastle. Moulana then travelled to India and returned to South Africa thereafter. Classes at Darul Uloom Newcastle started on 9 September 1973 with nine boarding students. For the first three years, Moulana taught alone while his wife cooked the students' food and washed their clothes.

The Metal West

The Metal West is the third full-length album by Kid Icarus. Released in 2005 by Summerstep Records, the album was the first by Kid Icarus to feature a full band, with the line-up consisting of guitarist Justin Marchegiani, bassist Ted Baird, keyboardist Chuck Keller, and drummer Thad Moyer. The album cover was painted by Cassie Rose Kobeski.
Reception.
PopMatters music critic Mike Schiller praised album track "A Retail Hell", calling it "a nice two-guitar acoustic tune about the mundane routine of everyday life that would sound a bit like Bright Eyes if Conor Oberst sang more than he emoted." 
Schiller gave the album a generally unfavorable review, however, saying that "side from a few tight, solid tunes, the rest of the album veers toward those attempts to expand the basic rock sound, and as such, The Metal West is a frustrating listen." 
"Spin" magazine writer Lane Brown described the album as having "a mellow, spacey vibe that would collapse under the weight of a slicker treatment." 
Brown added that while "The Metal West" contains immediate highlights, such as the title track and "Beekeepers on the Edge of Town", the album benefits from repeated listening.
Track listing.
"All songs written by Eric Schlittler."

August Frank

August Franz Frank (5 April 1898 – 21 March 1984) was Nazi German official of the SS Main Economic Administration Office (), generally known by its initials WVHA. The WVHA was, among other things, responsible for the administration of the Nazi concentration camps. After the war, the higher WVHA officials, including Frank, were placed on trial for, and convicted of, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Early Nazi career.
Frank joined the SS as a private on May 1, 1932, and the Nazi party on January 1, 1933. From 1933 to 1935, Frank worked at minor administrative duties in connection with a number of small industries at the Dachau concentration camp manned by inmate labor, most of which were concerned with concentration camp maintenance.
Rise in Nazi hierarchy.
In 1935, at the request of Oswald Pohl, Frank became SS Administrative Officer of the Special Purpose Troops ("SS-Verfügungstruppe") and of the concentration camp guards, the SS Death's Head units ("SS-Totenkopfverbände"), although the presence of a bureaucratic rival somewhat limited his authority in the second capacity. In February 1940, Frank became chief supply officer of the Waffen SS and Death's Head units under Pohl.
Concentration camp administrator.
When the WVHA was organized in 1942, he became Pohl's deputy chief of WVHA and chief of Department ("Amtsgruppe") A, the administrative division of WVHA. He served in this capacity until 1 September 1943, when he was permitted to resign to become administrative chief of the Order Police. Amtsgruppe A was the administrative branch of WVHA. It comprised five offices ("Ämter"), as follows:
Involvement in the Holocaust.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 137-056310, Litzmannstadt, Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle.jpg|thumb|The SS Ethnic Germans Welfare Office ("Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle"), in Lodz, Poland, then occupied by Germany. On September 26, 1942, August Frank, an official of the SS concentration camp administration department directed that all property of the Jews murdered in Operation Reinhard be diverted to this office.
A measure of the detailed planning that Frank and other Nazis put into the carrying out of the Holocaust and the deprivation of the property of the murdered Jews can be gauged from a memorandum prepared by Frank on September 26, 1942. For example, Frank gave instructions on dealing with the underwear of the murder victims. This memorandum, when it came to light after the war, played a key role in refuting Frank's claims that he had no knowledge that Jews were being murdered en masse in the extermination camps of Operation Reinhard. The memorandum is also notable as an example of the use of the Nazi euphemism "evacuation" of the Jews, which meant their systematic murder.
Crimes against humanity.
After World War II, Frank was placed on trial on accusations that during his work at WVHA he had committed crimes against humanity. The court concerned itself with Frank's conduct between 1 September 1939, and 1 September 1943. 
Frank's defense was that he thought the only people in concentration camps were solely composed of German nationals who were either habitual criminals or genuine threats to the Nazi regime. This argument was rejected by the court, which found that Frank knew and actively participated in the Nazi slave labor program. 
The court held that the following evidence, among other things, showed Frank's knowledge of the international slave labor program that the Nazi concentration camps had become:
Frank appears to have planned to personally profit from concentration camp labor. He was an incorporating partner with Georg Loerner, another WVHA official, in a leather and textile enterprise at Dachau. Based on this and other evidence, the court rejected Frank's testimony as incredible:
Involvement in genocide.
Frank's lawyer claimed Frank "did not work for the political aims of National Socialism." This position was rejected by the court:
In particular, Frank at his trial claimed he only became aware of the Jewish extermination program after hearing Himmler's Posen speech on October 4, 1943, a month after he had left the WVHA. By this time, the Nazis had nearly completed the mass killings of the Jews of Poland and nearby areas of Eastern Europe in what has become known as Action Reinhard, also known as Operation Reinhard and the Reinhard action. Frank handled the huge amount of personal property that was either robbed from the Jews while they were alive or stolen from their bodies (there were 2,000 car loads of textiles, for instance). In his September 26, 1942 memorandum, Frank had chosen to designate this property as "Jewish concealed and stolen goods." The court rejected Frank's claim that he couldn't have known of the source of these goods:
Frank claimed that he didn't know and had no reason to know that the people from whom the property had come from had been murdered en masse; he testified that he thought all the property accumulating from Operation Reinhard had come from Jews who had died naturally in concentration camps. The court rejected this contention, relying again on the categories of property Frank had dealt with in his September 26, 1942 memorandum :
Acquitted of mass murder.
Although the court had ruled that Frank was criminally answerable for the slave labor program and the looting of Jewish property, he escaped criminal liability for the murders themselves, as the court viewed him as in generally being only involved after the people had already been murdered.
Member of criminal organization (Nazi SS).
Frank was found guilty also of being a member of a criminal organization, that is, the Nazi SS. Frank's highest rank in the SS was Lieutenant General ("Obergruppenführer").
Sentence and commutation.
On November 3, 1947, Frank was sentenced to life in prison by the tribunal with the following words:
In 1951 Frank's sentence was commuted to 15 years. Frank was released from Landsberg Prison on 7 May 1954. He died in March 1984.

David McKay (journalist)

David McKay (14 May 1921 – 26 December 2004) was an Australian journalist and prominent motoring identity.
While most well known as a journalist, specifically as a motoring writer, McKay was also a prominent figure in motor racing as both a driver and a race team owner. That team, Scuderia Veloce, was the first Australian-based professional racing team, and in addition to furthering McKay's own racing career also furthered the careers of many young racing drivers including Spencer Martin, Brian Muir and Greg Cusack amongst others.
In 1958 McKay won the Australian Tourist Trophy at Bathurst in an Aston Martin DB3S. Then in 1960 McKay achieved the most memorable victory in his career, winning the inaugural Australian Touring Car Championship at the Gnoo Blas circuit in Orange driving a Jaguar Mark 1. But for a post-race penalty for a jump start, McKay would also have won the 1961 Australian Grand Prix at Mallala in South Australia but instead finished 3rd, only 4 seconds behind Lex Davison and Bib Stillwell. McKay drove a Cooper T51-Climax FPF in the Grand Prix.
Despite continuing to race various cars from open wheelers to sports cars and Production Touring Cars until his last race, the 1979 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 in a standard Volvo 242 GT with Spencer Martin where they finished 20th, McKay never again contested the ATCC as a driver following his win in 1960.
McKay was also responsible for the first ever factory backed Holden team in 1968 when he formed the Holden Dealer Racing Team. The team ran 3 brand new Holden Monaro GTS 327's in the 1968 Hardie-Ferodo 500 at Mount Panorama, Bathurst. Jim Palmer and Phil West finished 2nd outright behind the winning Monaro of Bruce McPhee and Barry Mulholland. Brian Muir and 1964 winner George Reynolds finished 5th while the Paul Hawkins / Bill Brown car was disqualified.
McKay also organised a separate team of Holden Monaros to contest the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon. The cars were prepared by Holden, entered under the "Sydney Telegraph" name, and sponsored by the Daily Telegraph, a Sydney newspaper for which McKay was a motoring writer. McKay himself drove the lead car with Sydney's Barry Ferguson the lead driver in the team's second car while three time Australian Grand Prix winner Doug Whiteford was drafted in to drive the third Monaro. McKay failed to finish, Ferguson finished 12th while Whiteford finished 14th.
McKay's career as a writer began in 1949 and he worked for the Sir Frank Packer owned newspapers "The Daily Telegraph" and "The Sunday Telegraph" from 1956 to 1975, first as a writer and later as the motoring editor. It was while working for Packer that McKay convinced him to co-sponsor the London-Sydney Marathon, as well as the Monaros McKay would run in the race.
McKay died of cancer on 26 December 2004. He was 83.

<doc id="21602751" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21602751" title="Magdalen Society of Philadelphia">
Magdalen Society of Philadelphia

The Magdalen Society of Philadelphia was a private charitable organization founded in 1800 to redeem prostitutes and other "fallen" women. This was the first association in the United States that sought to rescue and reform wayward women. A number of local clergymen and citizens affiliated with Quaker, Episcopal and Presbyterian denominations met to form the Society. Bishop William White, the nation's highest-ranking Episcopal bishop, was the first president of the Society, which officially incorporated in 1802. The organization was based on Magdalen hospitals in England and Ireland, which were named for Mary Magdalene. Similarly designated groups were soon started in other American cities in the early 19th century.
Mission.
The stated purpose of Philadelphia's Magdalen Society was "restoring to the paths of virtue those unhappy females who in unguarded hours have been robbed of their innocence." In other words, to save women "who have been seduced from the paths of virtue and are desirous of returning to a life of rectitude." To accomplish its mission, the Society in 1808 opened a refuge to house about a dozen prostitutes and other errant women. Operated by an all-male Board of Managers, this was the "Home for Magdalens," once located at the northeast corner of Race and 21st Streets. (The Franklin Institute's Futures Center addition now stands on the site.)
Operation.
The women that the asylum admitted were called magdalens and were assigned a number in the order they entered the facility. They were mostly young immigrant women between the ages of 17 and 23 who were aimless, family-less, unsupported and in need of help. They generally did not share the Magdalen Society's image of their "guilt and wretchedness," but instead simply sought a sanctuary from disease, the prison or almshouse, unhappy family situations, abusive men, and dire economic circumstances.
A much larger Magdalen Home was erected at the same locality in the 1840s. This building separated the inmates ("magdalens") from the staff, and recalcitrant inmates from new arrivals. Fences and eventually a 13-foot wall were built around the property to keep the magdalens from seeing or otherwise interacting with the encroaching city.
The Philadelphia Magdalen Society aided 2,726 women in all, attempting to change them into domestic servants, factory workers, seamstresses or laundresses—and sometimes even returning the inmates to their families, hopefully with a more "proper" mindset. Still, even the Board of Managers conceded that few magdalens were converted to lives of virtue. So the Society began to focus on preventing waywardness and providing education to unruly girls.
The Home for Magdalens moved to Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, in 1915, about the time that it was becoming clear that the refuge had outlived its usefulness. Other private organizations and state institutions had become concerned with the treatment of "delinquent" girls, and the asylum's functions had been taken over by city courts, which placed youthful offenders on probation rather than committing them to institutions.
White-Williams Foundation for Girls.
The Society began to seek a new direction for its work. It wanted to find ways to prevent the delinquency it had worked to treat for over a hundred years. The Board of Managers voted to address the heart of the problem by providing direction and assistance to steer children away from trouble. Accordingly, the Magdalen Society changed its name to White-Williams Foundation for Girls in 1918. (The name honored Bishop William White and George Williams, a Quaker philanthropist and former Board chairman.) White-Williams began the service that it continues today: providing stipends to needy Philadelphia students. Now known as White-Williams Scholars, the organization currently serves both male and female pupils in Philadelphia public high schools.

<doc id="21602806" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21602806" title="Sample maximum and minimum">
Sample maximum and minimum

In statistics, the sample maximum and sample minimum, also called the largest observation, and smallest observation, are the values of the greatest and least elements of a sample. They are basic summary statistics, used in descriptive statistics such as the five-number summary and seven-number summary and the associated box plot.
The minimum and the maximum value are the first and last order statistics (often denoted "X"(1) and "X"("n") respectively, for a sample size of "n").
If there are outliers, they necessarily include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, depending on whether they are extremely high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum need not be outliers, if they are not unusually far from other observations.
Robustness.
The sample maximum and minimum are the "least" robust statistics: they are maximally sensitive to outliers.
This can either be an advantage or a drawback: if extreme values are real (not measurement errors), and of real consequence, as in applications of extreme value theory such as building dikes or financial loss, then outliers (as reflected in sample extrema) are important. On the other hand, if outliers have little or no impact on actual outcomes, then using non-robust statistics such as the sample extrema simply cloud the statistics, and robust alternatives should be used, such as other quantiles: the 10th and 90th percentiles (first and last decile) are more robust alternatives.
Derived statistics.
Other than being a component of every statistic that uses all samples, the sample extrema are important parts of the range, a measure of dispersion, and mid-range, a measure of location. They also realize the maximum absolute deviation: they are the "furthest" points from any given point, particularly a measure of center such as the median or mean.
Applications.
Summary statistics.
Firstly, the sample maximum and minimum are basic summary statistics, showing the most extreme observations, and are used in the five-number summary and seven-number summary and the associated box plot.
Prediction interval.
The sample maximum and minimum provide a non-parametric prediction interval:
in a sample set from a population, or more generally an exchangeable sequence of random variables, each sample is equally likely to be the maximum or minimum.
Thus if one has a sample set formula_1 and one picks another sample formula_2 then this has formula_3 probability of being the largest value seen so far, formula_3 probability of being the smallest value seen so far, and thus the other formula_5 of the time, formula_6 falls between the sample maximum and sample minimum of formula_7
Thus, denoting the sample maximum and minimum by "M" and "m," this yields an formula_5 prediction interval of ["m","M"].
For example, if "n"=19, then ["m","M"] gives an 18/20 = 90% prediction interval – 90% of the time, the 20th observation falls between the smallest and largest observation seen heretofore. Likewise, "n"=39 gives a 95% prediction interval, and "n"=199 gives a 99% prediction interval.
Estimation.
Due to their sensitivity to outliers, the sample extrema cannot reliably be used as estimators unless data is clean – robust alternatives include the first and last deciles.
However, with clean data or in theoretical settings, they can sometimes prove very good estimators, particularly for platykurtic distributions, where for small data sets the mid-range is the most efficient estimator.
They are inefficient estimators of location for mesokurtic distributions, such as the normal distribution, and leptokurtic distributions, however.
Uniform distribution.
For sampling without replacement from a uniform distribution with one or two unknown endpoints (so formula_9 with "N" unknown, or formula_10 with both "M" and "N" unknown), the sample maximum, or respectively the sample maximum and sample minimum, are sufficient and complete statistics for the unknown endpoints; thus an unbiased estimator derived from these will be UMVU estimator.
If only the top endpoint is unknown, the sample maximum is a biased estimator for the population maximum, but the unbiased estimator formula_11 (where "m" is the sample maximum and "k" is the sample size) is the UMVU estimator; see German tank problem for details.
If both endpoints are unknown, then the sample range is a biased estimator for the population range, but correcting as for maximum above yields the UMVU estimator.
If both endpoints are unknown, then the mid-range is an unbiased (and hence UMVU) estimator of the midpoint of the interval (here equivalently the population median, average, or mid-range).
The reason the sample extrema are sufficient statistics is that the conditional distribution of the non-extreme samples is just the distribution for the uniform interval between the sample maximum and minimum – once the endpoints are fixed, the values of the interior points add no additional information.
Normality testing.
The sample extrema can be used for a simple normality test, specifically of kurtosis: one computes the t-statistic of the sample maximum and minimum (subtracts sample mean and divides by the sample standard deviation), and if they are unusually large for the sample size (as per the three sigma rule and table therein, or more precisely a Student's t-distribution), then the kurtosis of the sample distribution deviates significantly from that of the normal distribution.
For instance, a daily process should expect a 3σ event once per year (of calendar days; once every year and a half of business days), while a 4σ event happens on average every 40 years of calendar days, 60 years of business days (once in a lifetime), 5σ events happen every 5,000 years (once in recorded history), and 6σ events happen every 1.5 million years (essentially never). Thus if the sample extrema are 6 sigmas from the mean, one has a significant failure of normality.
Further, this test is very easy to communicate without involved statistics.
These tests of normality can be applied if one faces kurtosis risk, for instance.
Extreme value theory.
Sample extrema play two main roles in extreme value theory:
However, caution must be used in using sample extrema as guidelines: in heavy-tailed distributions or for non-stationary processes, extreme events can be significantly more extreme than any previously observed event. This is elaborated in black swan theory.

Plaza de la Independencia

Independence Square (, or colloquially as Plaza Grande) is the principal and central public square of Quito, Ecuador. This is the central square of the city and one of the symbols of the executive power of the nation. Its main feature is the monument to the independence heroes of August 10, 1809, date remembered as the First Cry of Independence of the Royal Audience of Quito from spanish monarchy. The square is flanked by the Carondelet Palace, the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Archbishop's Palace, the Municipal Palace and the Plaza Grande Hotel.
The square is surrounded by the following four streets: "Calle Venezuela" (east), "Calle Chile" (north), "Calle Gabriel García Moreno" (west) and the pedestrian segment of "Calle Eugenio Espejo" (south).
History.
Although the first colonial town square was what today is known as Plazoleta Benalcázar, this has always been considered as tentative as it got up a path suitable for novice Spanish town of Quito. It was only in the 17th century, in the year 1612, when the powers of the city moved to the area around the Plaza Grande, they decided to call this way for being the largest at the time.
Creation.
Initially it was just an esplanade of packed dirt that was placed in a water source to supply the vital liquid to the neighbors. Being larger than the tentative square, and unemployed land still be around, some institutions decided to stand on its flanks. Thus the Catholic Church acquired land in the north and south sides, where they built the main temple of the city (Cathedral of Quito) and the headquarters of the archdiocese (Archbishop's Palace).
One of the founders of the city, the Captain Juan de Díaz Hidalgo, reserved to himself a lot on the corner of the square near the Archbishop's Palace, where he built his home (the only private building that endures to this day) that palace would later be called Palacio Hidalgo. Other families, also founders of the town, occupied the western end, but after the earthquake of 1627, were overturned by the serious damage that occurred in structures, and instead built the Palacio de Carondelet.
Finally, on the eastern side of the square was constructed the structure for the nascent city council, construction was also demolished in the 1970s to build the city hall known as Municipality of Quito, for if it fulfills the same functions as the original, is a modern building.
16th to 19th centuries.
For several centuries after its founding, the Plaza Grande it was nothing but a paved plaza with a beautiful fountain in the center, around which rose at times a makeshift bullring to celebrate some festivities offered by the council on behalf of the Spanish crown.
Only in the eighteenth century it thinks of the place as a true square, the style of European cities. The president of the Royal Audience of Quito conceived the square landscapes, to serve as a garden for the Palacio de Carondelet. The palace topped its steps in the square and prohibited the passage of carts through the western edge of the square, which was next to Carondelet.
The square was reformed again in the early nineteenth century; withdraw the steps of the palace, now ended in the side streets of the building, and enabled again the passage of cars by the then called "Calle de las 7 Cruces" (now Garcia Moreno).
Modern period.
After many petitions by the municipal authorities, Ecuadorian President Eloy Alfaro ordered the construction in the Plaza of a monument to commemorate the centenary of the "first cry of independence". A French sculpture was commissioned in 1898 and placed in the center of the square, replacing the fountain which was moved to the southwest of the square. In a public ceremony in 1906, the President and Mayor unveiled the "Independence Monument" and changed the colonial name ("Plaza Grande") to "Plaza de la Independencia". Since then only minor changes have been made in the square, which retains its centrality in the national consciousness.
Buildings.
The square is flanked on four sides by monumental buildings, all of which — except the Municipality — date to the colonial period. Likewise all — except the Palace Hidalgo — are open to the public. They are:
In addition, at the corners of the "Plaza Grande", are four more notable buildings:

2/8th Commando Squadron (Australia)

The 2/8th Commando Squadron was one of 12 independent companies or commando squadrons raised by the Australian Army during the Second World War. Raised in July 1942 as the 2/8th Independent Company, the 2/8th spent the early years of the war performing garrison duties in the Northern Territory. In July 1944, the 2/8th sailed to Lae, in New Guinea from where they launched a clandestine reconnaissance operation on the island of New Britain. Later, attached to the II Corps, it participated in the Bougainville campaign, during which it was in action continuously for a period of nine months right up until the Japanese surrendered in August 1945. Following the end of hostilities, the 2/8th returned to Australia, and was disbanded at Liverpool, New South Wales in early January 1946.
History.
Formation and home duties.
The 2/8th Independent Company was formed at Wilsons Promontory, in Victoria in July 1942. Consisting of 17 officers and 256 other ranks, the company was organised into a headquarters, three infantry platoons, with attached signals, medical and engineering sections. It undertook training at the Guerilla Warfare School that had been set up there, before being sent to northern Australia to serve in a garrison role. During this time the company was stationed at Yandina, Queensland, and then later at the Adelaide River, in the Northern Territory. In 1943, as part of a re-organisation of the independent company concept, the 2/8th were renamed the 2/8th Cavalry (Commando) Squadron, which was later shortened to the 2/8th Commando Squadron. Despite this re-organisation, however, while other commando squadrons were amalgamated together into a regimental structure, the 2/8th remained independent and when they finally deployed overseas in mid-1944 to New Guinea, they were sent as an independent unit attached to the Australian II Corps.
New Britain campaign.
The squadron embarked from Townsville, Queensland, on 22 July 1944 and sailed to Lae, via Milne Bay, on board the SS "Ormiston". While they were there they received an intake of 70 experienced men from some of the other commando squadrons as reinforcements. Following this, the squadron undertook a period of jungle warfare training. After a few months, in mid-September, a small detachment of the 2/8th participated in a small-scale reconnaissance operation at Jacquinot Bay on the island of New Britain, to collect intelligence in preparation for an assault by the 5th Division. As part of this operation, elements from 'C' Troop and a small detachment from 'B' Troop, from the 2/8th Commando Squadron, provided the protection force for the reconnaissance party that was put ashore from the corvette HMAS "Kiama", setting up a position on the beach and conducting a number of patrols further inland. This operation was a success and later, in November, the 5th Division conducted an amphibious landing in the area unopposed.
Bougainville campaign.
In October, the 2/8th was transported on the troopship "Aconagua" to Torokina, which was the main Australian base on Bougainville, where it joined the rest of II Corps, who were concentrating in the area for the upcoming Bougainville campaign. As the campaign progressed the squadron conducted patrols from Torokina to Kuraio Mission and Amun in the northern sector on a weekly basis throughout November and into December, before handing over responsibility of the area to the 11th Brigade and being transferred to the southern sector. This was where the main battle for Bougainville was being fought, and as the 3rd Division advanced along the coast towards the Japanese base at Buin, the 2/8th was tasked to provide flank protection for the division. As a part of this, they conducted a number of reconnaissance patrols, often moving part of the way by barge, as well as conducting ambushes in order to keep the enemy off balance.
This lasted for almost nine months from December 1944 right up to the end of the war in August 1945, during which time the 2/8th was in action almost continuously. It was a long and hard campaign, and to a large extent this made up for the long periods of inactivity that the squadron had suffered while it had been garrisoned in Australia. Certainly the squadron was in the thick of it, with many of its members distinguishing themselves during this time, as evidenced by the rather large number of decorations 2/8th members earned in such a short space of time. The patrols during this time were conducted in small groups, usually no larger than two sections roughly 18–20 men, and they would last for between four to six days, although some lasted up to nine. Sometimes they would employ barges to move along the coast.
Having secured the coastal regions around the Jaba River, the squadron slowly began to move inland in order to strike into the enemy's rear, securing the many villages along the way. First they cleared to Sovele Mission, then the villages of Opai, Nihero and Morokaimoro, reaching Kilipaijino by the end of hostilities. As they went, each village taken became a patrol base and from there the squadron would gather topographical information such as track and terrain reports, and locate the enemy. Once sufficient information had been gathered and passed on to II Corps, the patrols would then attempt to ambush the enemy or try to take a prisoner. These raids were very effective in tying down the enemy and keeping them away from the 3rd Division's flanks, as they forced the Japanese to deploy troops to their rear areas, removing men from the front against which the larger infantry forces were then be able to engage.
Disbandment.
With the end of the war, as part of the large-scale demobilisation of Australian forces, the commando squadrons along with most of the other special forces units formed by the Australian Army were deemed surplus to requirements and the ranks of the squadron were slowly reduced as men who had earned enough points to do so were discharged, while others who did not were transferred to other units for further duties as part of the occupation forces that were being sent to Japan. By the time that the squadron returned to Australia in December 1945 with a very small frontage. Finally, on 10 January 1946, while at Liverpool, New South Wales, the 2/8th Commando Squadron was disbanded and removed from the Australian Order of Battle.
During its service, the 2/8th lost seven men killed in action and 16 men wounded. Members of the squadron received the following decorations: one OBE, two DCMs, four MMs and 12 Mentioned in Dispatches.
Commanding officers.
The following officers served as commanding officer of the 2/8th:

The Juice Is Loose

"The Juice is Loose" is the ninth episode of the seventh season of the animated television series "Family Guy". It originally aired on March 15, 2009 on Fox. In the episode, Peter cashes in an old raffle ticket from 1989 and wins a golf outing with O. J. Simpson. When he befriends Simpson and brings him home to meet the family, the residents of Quahog are not as welcoming of the infamous running back and try to force him out of town.
The episode was written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Cyndi Tang. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode was viewed in 7.21 million homes in its original airing. The episode received negative reviews for its use of a three-minute long live-action segment of Conway Twitty. Series regular Mike Henry provided the voice of O.J. Simpson, and Cathy Cahlin Ryan guest starred as Fred Goldman's wife in a cutaway.
Plot.
According to an opening title card, this is one of several recently discovered "lost episodes" found in the Griffin family basement; it takes place in March 2007, prior to O. J. Simpson's September 2007 arrest for armed robbery. 
Lois goes to her book club and forces Peter to babysit football head Stewie. Instead, he invites Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe and they all play Truth or Dare, which results in a make out session between Cleveland and Joe. After a fiasco involving Stewie attempting to fix their satellite TV, Stewie ends up getting stuck on the roof, due to Peter's lack of supervision. Brian tries to tell Peter but he does not listen and instead reads a magazine featuring Nick Jonas. After starting a pillow fight that turns violent, Lois comes in, furious at Peter for leaving Stewie on the roof. Peter attempts to go fix the satellite himself, at which point he comes across a raffle ticket from 1989 that he had forgotten to cash in, winning him a chance to play golf with O. J. Simpson. 
Unaware of Simpson's accusation of his wife and his wife's friend Ron, he grows fearful after Joe convinces him to walk around town with the song Dust in the Wind while thinking about the murders. Ultimately deciding to cash in the ticket, his friends suggest he spy on Simpson during the golf game and try to get him to confess to the murders. Hooking Peter to a wire, his cover is blown when the device shorts out. Simpson laments having lost a chance of escaping the accusation. Feeling guilty, Peter decides that Simpson is actually innocent, and decides to befriend him. 
Peter brings Simpson home with him to meet the family, who are initially less tolerant of Simpson than Peter. Brian tries to tell Peter that he should not trust Simpson just because he idolized him as a kid but Peter refuses.
Deciding to let Simpson stay at their house, word soon gets out of Simpson's presence in Quahog, causing Peter to decide to throw a house party and help everyone else get to know him better. Later that day, Peter and Simpson are met with an angry mob instead led by Mayor Adam West, intent on driving the latter out of town. Desperate for a place to live without being bothered by furious citizens, Simpson makes a heartfelt speech, professing that he is just as imperfect as everyone else, causing the residents of Quahog to apologize and embrace with him. A split second later, however, the tables turn to a surprise ending as Simpson takes out a knife and kills three people before running off. A furious mob goes on to chase after Simpson, as the Griffins look on, with Peter, wearing a guilty disappointed look, indifferently declaring, "I guess he "did" do it."
Production.
"The Juice is Loose" was written by Andrew Goldberg and directed by Cyndi Tang. The writing process began when Goldberg was creator Seth MacFarlane's assistant and was given a freelance episode. He wrote "Believe It or Not, Joe's Walking on Air", and executive producer David A. Goodman thought he did a "fantastic job". Goldberg submitted a three page-list of ideas for his next episode, and MacFarlane especially liked the story for "The Juice is Loose". They had to add a title card in the beginning of the episode saying that it was a "lost episode", as O.J. Simpson was sent to jail before the episode aired. The episode features a 3-minute long segment of an archive video of Conway Twitty performing "I See the Want To in Your Eyes", and executive producer Chris Sheridan had to explain to the Fox executives why the segment should be featured in the episode.
Series regular Mike Henry provided the voice of O.J. Simpson in the episode, and Cathy Cahlin Ryan guest starred as Fred Goldman's wife in a cutaway gag. In addition to Henry and Ryan, actors Reid Bruton, Jules Green, Augie Castagnola, Virenia Lind guest starred in the episode. Recurring voice actors Jeff Bergman, Max Burkholder, Ralph Garman, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, and writer John Viener made minor appearances in the episode.
Reception.
In its original airing on March 15, 2009, "The Juice is Loose" was watched by 7.21 million households and acquired a 3.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic. It was the most-watched show in the "Animation Domination" block, surpassing "The Simpsons", "American Dad!" and "King of the Hill". The episode received negative reviews from television sources and critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN gave "The Juice Is Loose" 5.5/10, saying that the episode was "a largely forgettable episode with only a few moments of brilliance". The review criticized the usage of a three-minute long Conway Twitty live action singing clip which was received as an "effort to reduce the amount of animation [...] for the episode". Alex Rocha of "TV Guide" said that he "did enjoy this episode" but called the Conway Twitty clip a "filler" and that he would have wanted to see a "blank screen or even commercials" instead. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club stated that the episode "relied on an overabundance of pop culture riffs far too dated to elicit much more than a brief chuckle", and also criticized the Conway Twitty clip. He graded "The Juice Is Loose" a C+.

Salvia recurva

Salvia recurva is a woody-based perennial native to the cloud forests of Central America, limited to the northern slopes of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Guatemala at elevations around . It grows where there is year-round warmth and abundant moisture in the air and on the forest floor. "Salvia recurva" was described by George Bentham in 1848, with the specific epithet referring to the distinct curve in the inflorescence when it first appears.
"Salvia recurva" grows to 6 feet high and 4 feet wide, and is covered with large ovate leaves that are 6 inches long and wide, with the back of the leaf having pronounced veins. The upper surface of the leaf is purple, along with the petiole, which can reach 6 inches long. Inflorescences reach 1 foot long, with flowers in whorls of 6-12, many of them blooming at once. When the inflorescence begins growing, all that can be seen are tightly packed lime-green calyces, which turn purple as the flower matures. The showy and elegant flowers are dark purple, reaching 2 inches in length, with the upper lip lightly covered in hairs, and the lower lip descending downward. The calyces are large, turning dark purple, along with the stem of the inflorescence.

Solemn on Stage Live

Solemn on Stage Live is Joey Yung's second major concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum and first concert series performing more than one show (she performed for three consecutive nights). The concert was originally called "Blow Up the Hong Kong Coliseum Live", and the concert theme was originally titled "Explosive Queen". Due to the 9/11 terrorist attacks though, the concert was renamed "Solemn on Stage Live" and the concert theme was retitled, "Solemn on Stage". 
~H2O+ Solemn on Stage Live 2001.
The Stage.
The set included a large in-the-round stage with multiple elevators and a rotating stage. There were also six large projection screens set above the stage showing live as well as pre-recorded footage. Props included a large "ice throne", a big swing, as well as a golf car.
The Show.
To open up the show, a clip of Eason in the bathroom was recorded. In the clip, Eason teased the audience, welcoming them to his "The Easy Ride" concert, as well as made fun of Joey's funny mispronunciation of the concert name and themesong title, "隆重登場". He also warned the audience about the fireworks, and told them not to use flash photography. He also told them not to go to the washroom during the concert because it was "rude". 
For the opening, Joey was raised from under the stage while singing a verse from "逃避你" amidst a short fireworks display. Shortly after, dancers entered the stage and they performed "隆重登場" and "全身暑假". After, Joey sang "這分鐘更愛你" while bubbles were released on to the stage, followed by a performance of "阿門".
For the second part, Joey performed "你說得對" with dancers dressed up as colourful cartoon bears, taking pictures around the arena. This was followed by a performance of "Goodbye" while Joey shook hands with the audience and handed out presents. Joey then sang 何苦 on a swing that suspended her into the air as artificial smoke flew down from above the stage.
The third part started with a "Fantasy Interlude" which had the dancers dance while dressed up as "vine monsters". Joey was lifted from under the stage singing "走著睡" on an "ice throne". She then performed "穿花蝴碟" dancing with one of her choreographers. 
For the fourth act Joey sang 告解, playing the flute for the beginning and ending of the song. Joey then sang a medley of "karaoke songs", asking the audience to sing along (from then on, Joey would always include a singalong segment in her major concerts which reflects the "queen of karaoke" title that she earned early in her career). The medley included a cover of Eason Chan's 
Shall We Talk", Faye Wong's "給自己的情書", Andy Hui's "男人最痛", and her own song, "逃避你". This medley of karaoke songs was then followed by a medley of fast songs, including "相當刺激", "最新消息", and "不容錯失". 
For the fifth act Joey performed a number of ballads including "最好時光", "再見我的初戀", and "痛愛".
After the fifth act was the pre-planned encore segment. For this segment of the concert, Joey drove a gol car on stage followed by a performance of 未知. The car broke down though during the last night though, so Joey had to walk up on stage instead. After the song, Joey sat on a bean bag chair and talked about how she became a singer and the ups and downs she has faced since her debut. In between her speech she also performed "一首獨唱的歌", a song by Shirley Kwan that she performed back when she entered the Big Echo Karaoke Contest in 1995, the contest that helped win her a contract with Go East (though the contract was terminated before she could officially debut). She also performed a rearranged version of "誰來愛我" accompanied by the piano. After, all her dancers joined her for the last song of the concert, "美麗在望".
Set list.
This is the general rundown Joey sang for most of the shows, though certain shows had slightly different rundowns.

Deterministic Parallel Java

Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ) is an extension of the Java programming language which adds parallel constructs that provide a deterministic programming model for object-oriented languages. The language extensions define a type system that a programmer (or interactive porting tool) can use to annotate Java code with type information, and a compiler can use to type-check that a DPJ program has deterministic semantics, i.e., produces the same visible output for a given input, in all executions. Parallel algorithms that cannot be expressed entirely in the statically checked type system require run-time mechanisms to enforce determinism: two key research goals are to make the type system more expressive and to minimize the need to fall back to run-time techniques. With minor modifications, language extensions should be applicable to other base OO languages, such as C++ and C#.

Jon Winkelried

Jon Winkelried (c. 1959 – ) is an American former financial executive who served as the Co-President of Goldman Sachs Group from 2006 to February 2009. He is known for suddenly retiring at the top of his career at age 49.
Early life and education.
Winkelreid grew up in Millburn, New Jersey, the son of a Jewish father, Irwin, who managed local parking garages, and a mother who was a schoolteacher. He attended the University of Chicago on a full athletic scholarship (baseball) where he earned both an undergraduate degree and an MBA. While in school he joined Phi Gamma Delta with his good friend Byron Trott who was also on the baseball team. [http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20101218/ISSUE01/312189979/big-chicago-money-backs-byron-trotts-buyout-firm]
Career.
Winkelried worked as an intern in the trading department at Goldman Sachs in the summer prior to graduating in 1982. He later accepted a permanent job at Goldman in the investment banking department in the Utilities Group. In 1984, he moved to the trading floor and soon was heading up the bond syndication business. In 1990, he became a partner. From there, he moved to London to turn around the European side of the Goldman's fixed-income, currency, and commodities business (known as FICC). He was made co-head of FICC with Lloyd Blankfein. Cohn and Winkelried were a good team but were more competitors than friends. FICC was returned to solid profitability.
In June 2006, Goldman's CEO Hank Paulson, Winkelreid's mentor, accepted a position as the Secretary of the Treasury under President George H. Bush. Blankfein was appointed the new CEO and Winkelried was made co-chief operating officer and co-president with Gary Cohn. Their responsibilities were divided with Cohn running the trading and asset management side of the business (including FICC) and Winkelried responsible for investment and merchant banking.
Eventually Cohn's business lines were outperforming his own and Winkelreid, sensing that his position was tenuous (especially as Cohn was very close to Blankfein) decided that he would leave the firm. His last act would be to secure a $5B convertible preferred investment from Warren Buffett in Goldman during the financial crisis to secure the company's solvency. Blankfein was not happy with his decision to leave.
Personal life.
He has been married to Abby Lipsey, a preschool teacher, since 1986. They have three children: Matt, Jen, and Jane.
He owns two ranches in Meeker, Colorado: the Marvine and the Pot Hole. Winkelried is an expert "cutter," a sport in which horseback riders separate a calf from the herd (historically done for vaccination, castration, or sorting purposes).

Patrick Dowd

Patrick Dowd (born 1968) is a Democratic Party politician in the United States. From 2008 until 2013, he served as a member of the Pittsburgh City Council from District 7, which includes the neighborhoods of Bloomfield, East Liberty, Friendship, Garfield, Highland Park, Lawrenceville, Morningside, Polish Hill, and Stanton Heights.
Personal life and educational career.
Dowd was raised in Chesterfield, Missouri and earned a B.A. from the University of Missouri. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1991 to study with Fritz Ringer in the Department of History at the University of Pittsburgh, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1999. He has taught history first at Winchester Thurston School and then at The Ellis School. He is married to Leslie Hammond, who also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh before becoming a lecturer in the history department. They have five children and live in Highland Park.
Political career.
Pittsburgh Board of Education.
In 2003, Dowd won a four-year term on the Board after defeating incumbent Board President and Democrat Darlene Harris in an upset.
As a candidate for school board, Dowd pledged to restore accountability to the system and in an intensely heated January 26, 2005 board meeting. 
Dowd led a five members coalition to removing Dr. John Thompson as the Superintend of the Pittsburgh Public Schools. The board launched a national search for a superintendent. The board hired Mark Roosevelt. 
Dowd's departure from the board came in December 2007. His Accountability Contract and evaluation model remained in effect as did RISE, a program of teacher evaluation and PELA, a program for principals.
Pittsburgh City Council.
Dowd was elected as the Democratic nominee to represent District 7 on the Pittsburgh City Council on May 15, 2007, and won the seat unopposed on November 6, 2007.
(Primary elections are generally decisive in the heavily Democratic city of Pittsburgh.) 
He began serving on January 7, 2008. Shortly after taking office, Dowd drafted and successfully encouraged his colleagues to sign a Proclamation to Improve Governance in Pittsburgh. Dowd also crafted and council passed a resolution calling for a task force on intergovernmental cooperation which led to the creation of CONNECT, a Pittsburgh-based development initiative to increase cooperation between Pittsburgh and its adjacent municipalities. In May, 2008, Dowd also started an innovative constituent outreach program called Council-to-Go which enables him to stay in regular contact with residents of his council district. Dowd consistently worked with Ravenstahl to bring increased focus on bike and pedestrian initiatives. In 2010 Dowd led a coalition that included Council President Harris, Councilwoman Rudiak and Controller Lamb and that offered a viable alternative to Ravenstahl's proposed 50-year lease of all public parking assets in the Pittsburgh. In the fall of 2011 the state accepted this plan.
As a member of the board of the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, Dowd made customer service and infrastructure reinvestment top priorities. In 2009, PWSA launched a controversial water and sewer line insurance program that has successfully provided coverage to nearly 100,000 customers That same year, Dowd was instrumental in the creation of the Distribution Infrastructure System Reinvestment Fund, which added 5% charge to customers bills and dedicated that revenue solely to infrastructure reinvestment. In 2010, Dowd supported the PWSA administration in bid to reinvest in its antiquated information system. Dowd also led the effort to bring an outside management firm in on an interim basis to overhaul the management of the Authority. Veolia of North America began their innovative contractual relationship with PWSA in July, 2012. They are scheduled to be in Pittsburgh until December, 2014.
In 2011 Dowd and Judge Frank Lucchino led a voter initiative to create a new library tax in Pittsburgh. The ballot initiative called for the creation of a 0.25 mills property tax dedicated to the Carnegie Librargy and received the backing of 72% of Pittsburgh voters. This tax is part of a six prong effort to provide sustainable funding for the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.
Dowd announced in June 2013 that he would resign his seat on city council effective in mid-July to become the inaugural executive director of Allies for Children, a start-up advocacy group, http://alliesforchildren.wordpress.com/. A special election to fill his seat was held with the regularly scheduled municipal election in November 2013. The seat on city council was won by Deborah Gross, the endorsed D in the race. 
Dowd also served as a member of the board of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Riverlife and the Pittsburgh Zoo.
Mayoral campaign.
Dowd announced on February 19, 2009 that he would challenge mayor Luke Ravenstahl in Pittsburgh's May 19 Democratic primary. In his announcement, Dowd criticized what he saw as Ravenstahl's failures on campaign finance reform in light of the mayor's veto of a campaign finance reform bill in the summer of 2008, a risky bond deal at the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, wasteful spending and the Lamar LED controversy. Dowd was endorsed by the Stonewall Democrats and the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", among others, but lost in a three-way race to Ravenstahl by 31 points, receiving 28 percent of the vote.
Allies for Children.
In June 2013 Dowd announced he would step down from City Council to become the inaugural executive director of Allies for Children a start up child advocacy non-profit in the Pittsburgh region.

Queensland State Archives

The Queensland State Archives is the custodian of the largest and most significant documentary heritage collection in Queensland and the lead agency for public recordkeeping. 
Established in 1959, Queensland State Archives promotes the implementation of appropriate recordkeeping principles and practices across public authorities and regulates the retention and disposal of public records. 
Queensland State Archives develops recordkeeping policy and provides advice to public authorities on the management of public records and facilitates access to information about government for the people of Queensland. 
Under sections 24 and 25 of the Public Records Act 2002, Queensland State Archives has a range of functions and powers including the ability to:
History.
Recordkeeping in Queensland is not just a modern or new activity. As early as November 1861, an extract from the Brisbane Courier refers to provision of storage for valuable historical documents relating to the early history of the settlement. In 1917 the Royal Historical Society of Queensland called for a “proper system of dealing with the archives of Queensland”. Later, in 1932 the Governor of Queensland, Sir Leslie Wilson wrote to the Premier, W. Forgan Smith regarding a Central Record Office expressing his concern at the inadequate storage and subsequent destruction of many valuable public records. In 1939, Sir Raphael Cilento (a former Vice President of the Royal Historical Society of Queensland) commented that a Department of Archives should be established.
Libraries Act 1943.
When the Queensland Government passed the Libraries Act of 1943, Part IV of the Act dealt with public records. However, there was a provision in Part IV to postpone its implementation and archival legislation was not implemented for another 15 years. In 1953 the Government claimed that "it has not been possible to implement this portion of the Act owing to difficulties which have arisen, chief of which has been a lack of suitable space in which to store and display these documents.” 
While some records were transferred to the State Library of Queensland for preservation, it was not until 31 July 1958 that Part IV of The Libraries Act 1943-1949 was proclaimed and became effective. In 1959, Robert Sharman was appointed as the first Archivist within the State Library, and Queensland State Archives commenced its activities. 
The Act placed archival authority in the hands of the State Librarian and made the Library Board of Queensland responsible for the destruction of records. The official position of State Archivist was not created until more than 20 years later in September 1981.
Genealogy interest and the associated challenges.
By the late 1970s and early 1980s a surge in genealogical and family history research created a heavy demand for reference services and access to records. The Queensland State Archives Public Search Room was expanded to accommodate more clients and a modern storage warehouse in Acacia Ridge was acquired in 1983. The State Archivist of the day, Paul Wilson focused on Queensland State Archives’ role in the management of semi-current records, including the preparation of a wide range of retention and disposal schedules. 
In 1986 Queensland State Archives was accorded the status of a Division of the State Library of Queensland and developed a proposal for a new purpose-built facility. The Libraries and Archives Act 1988 defined the role and functions of Queensland State Archives and gave additional protection to public records through an increase in the powers of the State Archivist. It also expanded the definition of public records to include computerised records.
Public Records Act 2002.
The Queensland Government introduced the Public Records Act 2002 in July 2002. It replaced Part 7 (sections 56-67) of the Libraries and Archives Act 1988 and the Libraries and Archives Regulations 1990 with a new statute devoted specifically to the management of public records. The Act provided a contemporary framework for the management of public records and also marked a changing role for Queensland State Archives.
Queensland State Archives is established under section 21 of the Public Records Act 2002 (the Act) as the State’s archives and records management authority. With the introduction of the Act, Queensland State Archives became the lead agency for State and local government recordkeeping in Queensland. The Act and its accompanying Recordkeeping Information Standards enable Queensland State Archives to develop and implement a comprehensive recordkeeping policy framework to ensure a consistent approach to the creation, management, disposal, storage, preservation, and retrieval of government information.
Related legislation.
Public authorities are required to make 'complete and accurate records' in accordance with the Public Records Act 2002 (the Act). To help public authorities to achieve this Queensland State Archives developed in 2002, Information Standard 40: Recordkeeping (IS40. 
This Information Standard aims to foster recordkeeping best practice across the Queensland public sector. The objective of recordkeeping best practice is to establish it as a systematic part of the essential business activities of all public authorities so that records are identified, captured and retained in accessible and usable formats that preserve the evidential integrity of those records for as long as they are required. 
Queensland State Archives buildings.
With the appointment of an Archivist in 1959, space was initially allocated in the Commissariat Stores in William Street, Brisbane, but this building was full by March 1962. Additional space in the Anzac Square government building and the old Lady Bowen hospital also filled rapidly. 
In July 1968 Queensland State Archives was relocated to a purpose-built facility in Dutton Park. Conservation was accorded a new emphasis in the Dutton Park building, with fumigation chambers installed to deal with pest and mould infestation. Stricter environmental controls were placed upon the storage of the records. There was an increase in the number and complexity of reference enquiries and new reprography services were introduced. A microfilm camera was purchased in 1971 and a microfilm storage vault was built. The use of microfilm provided access to heavily used records while preserving the original documents. Space was again an issue by 1974 and in 1978 a building at West End in Brisbane was acquired for use as remote storage. A new building was proposed and a site selected at Runcorn. 
The current Queensland State Archives building at Runcorn, Brisbane was built in 1992. Officially opened in 1993, it was nominated for an architectural award and as a finalist received a commendation. 
Continuing growth in the amount of archival public records led to the construction of a new building adjacent and connected to the existing Queensland State Archives building. The expanded facility opened on 10 November 2008, bringing the total floor area of Queensland State Archives to 23,322m2 and the total storage to approximately 90 linear kilometres. The expansion includes additional repositories which will allow Queensland State Archives to store records transferred from more than 600 Queensland public authorities for the next 10 to 15 years. The new Queensland State Archives building was designed to complement the appearance of the original building and to continue providing a secure, purpose-built environment that will aid in the long-term preservation of Queensland’s documentary heritage. 
The expanded facility project features environmentally sustainable initiatives including water harvesting from roof areas and car park surfaces for re-use in irrigation; recycling of water from cooling tower operations and efficient air-conditioning services, incorporating a purpose-built three million litre chilled water tank for off-peak electricity. Recycled or recyclable materials and fabrics were used in the construction, wherever possible.
Access to records.
Open records held by Queensland State Archives may be viewed onsite in the Public Search Room. Information about the records held can be found using the Queensland State Archives database ArchivesSearch. This database contains details of records and other information about State and local government agencies. Searching may locate references to Queensland Government records held by Queensland State Archives. Queensland State Archives also provides a reference service to remote users.

Ceanothus roderickii

Ceanothus roderickii is a rare species of shrub in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae known by the common name Pine Hill ceanothus. It is endemic to western El Dorado County, California, where it grows in the chaparral and woodlands of the Sierra Nevada foothills, such as the Pine Hill Ecological Reserve. It is named after 20th century California flora explorer, botanist, and arboretum director Wayne Roderick.
Description.
This rare shrub is up to about 3 meters wide and flat, forming low brambles or mats. The grayish brown stems root at nodes as they grow horizontally along the ground. The tiny evergreen leaves are oppositely arranged. Each is only about a centimeter long, widely lance-shaped and smooth along the edges or sometimes toothed near the tip. The top surface is green and hairless and the underside is somewhat woolly. The inflorescence is a small cluster of white to pale blue flowers. The fruit is a capsule about half a centimeter long, sometimes bearing small horns on top.
Habitat.
"Ceanothus roderickii" is found almost exclusively on soils of gabbro origin in the Pine Hill Geological Formation. It is a federally listed endangered species. 
Conservation.
This endangered plant was first collected in 1956 near Shingle Springs. It is threatened by several factors, including suppression of the wildfire it requires for reproduction, off-road vehicles, road maintenance and construction, and development. There are ten to twenty remaining occurrences.

Hunt (video game)

Hunt is a classic multiplayer computer game, in which each player wanders around a maze, represented using ASCII characters on an 80x24 terminal screen, and tries to kill as many other players before being killed himself.
Players can shoot bullets, bombs (which obliterate not only the target, but also the maze walls around it, depending on the strength of the bomb), and slime (which oozes along the corridors). Destroyed parts of the maze regenerate over time; on regeneration, "deflectors" can appear, which change the direction of projectiles. Occasionally, a "wandering bomb" appears, which explodes on contact. Players can form teams.
Play was managed by a daemon process called "huntd." The game could drive up the load average to higher levels than normal on earlier computers.

Garrucha (pistol)

The garrucha is a small pistol, similar to a derringer, common in southern Brazil and Argentina in the early 20th Century. It is usually double-barreled, though with the barrels side-by-side rather than vertical as is common in American derringers, and the bores can be rifled or smooth.
In Brazil, the most popular chamberings were for the .320 and .380 centrefire cartridges, similar to the .32 S&W and .38 S&W in appearance, but conical. They were also chambered for the .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle, and the .32, 8mm, and 9mm Flobert cartridges, among others.
These types of pistols were popular from 1730-1960 due to their low cost and small size, and were associated with the gauchos (cowboys) of the South American pampas.
In Brazil, Garruchas were produced by Castelo, Rossi, and Lerap.

Adela Verne

Adela Verne (27 February 18775 February 1952) was a notable English pianist and minor composer of German descent, born in Southampton. She was considered one of the greatest woman pianists of her era, ranked alongside the male keyboard giants of the time. She toured with great success in many parts of the world.
Adela (or Adèle) Verne was born into a musical family named Wurm. Three of her sisters (of her nine older siblings) were also notable pianists or composers: Mathilde and Alice both also adopted the surname Verne, but Mary retained the family name Wurm.
Clara Schumann heard Adela play when she was but a small girl. She was so impressed that she wanted to take her to Frankfurt for study, as she had done with Mathilde, however her parents would not permit this. Instead, she was instructed by Mathilde and Alice, and later by Clara Schumann's daughter Marie Schumann.
At age 13 she made her debut in Tchaikovsky's Concerto No.1 in B-flat minor, conducted by Sir August Manns at the Crystal Palace. Tchaikovsky himself heard of this astonishing young prodigy and wanted to meet her. The following year she was introduced to Ignacy Jan Paderewski. He was so impressed with her playing that he predicted a great future for her. At his home in Morges in Switzerland, she studied Chopin with Paderewski, as well as most of his own works, including the Sonata in E-flat minor, the "Polish Fantasy" and the Concerto in A minor, the work with which she made her orchestral debut in New York.
Adela Verne was hailed as the successor to Teresa Carreño, and was equally praised by North and South American, Australian, European and British audiences and critics. In Vienna, after hearing her play four concertos in one evening, Theodor Leschetizky gave her the rare honour of asking her to give a recital to his own pupils.
Her wide repertoire included a large amount from the 18th and 19th centuries, but also much from the 20th century, including works that were very modern for their day. She often appeared in chamber music recitals at the St James's Hall concerts, alongside artists such as the violinist Joseph Joachim and the cellist Alfredo Piatti.
She toured Australia with Dame Nellie Melba, and was associated on stage with other singers such as Luisa Tetrazzini, Amelita Galli-Curci and John McCormack, and violinists such as Mischa Elman, Eugène Ysaÿe and others. She appeared regularly at the Proms, and was the first British artist to give a solo recital at the Royal Albert Hall.
Her premiere performances were many: 
At the request of the BBC, in early 1952 she broadcast a special programme of works by Paderewski. Her last public appearance was at the special Jubilee Concerts celebrating the Wigmore Hall. She was preparing for her first recital at London's new Royal Festival Hall, when she died, on 5 February 1952, aged 74.
Adela Verne composed a variety of works, including a Military March dedicated to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother; her sister Mathilde's pupil).
Recorded legacy.
Adela Verne's recorded legacy is meagre. There were two issued discs for English Columbia:
L1212 - Ignacio Cervantes: Three Cuban Dances; Moritz Moszkowski: "La Jongleuse" (Recorded 1917, matrices 75981-1, 75983-1, available from November 1917 to April 1921)
L1213 - Frédéric Chopin: Polonaise in A flat, Op. 53 (Recorded 1917, matrices 75979-2, 75980-1, available from December 1917 to May 1928)
The matrix numbers suggest an unissued recording was made on matrix 75982.
Verne also recorded a number of piano rolls for Aeolian UK, around 1920/1.
03 - Cervantes: Three Cuban Dances
42 - Tchaikovsky: Meditation in D, Op. 72, No. 5
217 - Felix Mendelssohn: Prelude and Fugue in E minor, Op. 35, No. 1

Dilagrama m/65

The Dilagrama m/65 (Portuguese for acronym: "Dispositivo de lançamento de granadas de mão - modelo de 1965"; English translation: "Device for Launching Handgrenades - Model of 1965") is a device employed by the Portuguese Army that fits G3 Automatic Rifles allowing them to launch defensive Type m/63 hand grenades further than they can be thrown by hand.
The Dilagrama basically consists of a grenade adapter that fits the barrel of the G3. It is based on the US military's M1A2 Grenade Adapter, a modified M1 Grenade Adapter used with the M26-series Defensive Grenade. The adapter consists of a 3-pronged bracket for holding and securing the grenade (with the lever held down by a breakaway safety tab on the third prong), the tubular body for fitting to the launcher, and the tailfin assembly. The Dilagrama is launched with the use of special blank ammunition. The safety tab holding the grenade's arming lever breaks away when launched, arming the grenade in mid-air. Depending on the range, the grenade will then either air-burst over the target or impact and then detonate.
Use in Combat.
The Dilagrama was developed for the Portuguese Army in the 1960s for use in the Colonial Wars (1961-1974) in their possessions in Africa. Each "grupo de combate" (Platoon) usually fielded two soldiers armed with Dilagramas.

Ceanothus sanguineus

Ceanothus sanguineus is a species of shrub in the buckthorn family Rhamnaceae known by the common name redstem ceanothus. It is native to western North America from British Columbia to Montana to far northern California; it is also known from Michigan. It grows in temperate coniferous forest habitat in forest openings amidst the conifers. This is an erect shrub approaching 3 meters in maximum height. Its stem is red to purple in color, its woody parts green and hairless when new. The deciduous leaves are alternately arranged and up to about 10 centimeters long. They are thin, light green, oval, and generally edged with glandular teeth. The undersides are sometimes hairy. The inflorescence is a cluster of white flowers up to about 12 centimeters long. The fruit is a three-lobed smooth capsule about 4 millimeters long. This shrub is an important food plant for wild ungulates such as the Rocky Mountain Elk, it is browsed eagerly by many types of livestock, and the seed is consumed by many types of animals. Like many other "Ceanothus", this species requires wildfire for reproduction and proliferation; its seeds are activated by heat and the plant is intolerant of the shade produced by an overgrown forest.

Empire State Pride Agenda

The Empire State Pride Agenda (ESPA) is a statewide political advocacy organization in New York that advocates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights, including same-sex marriage. ESPA was founded in 1990 through the merger of the New York State Gay and Lesbian Lobby and the Friends and Advocates for Individual Rights. ESPA is considered the leading gay political organization in the State of New York. As of 2005, ESPA was the largest statewide lesbian and gay political advocacy and civil rights organization in the United States.
ESPA played a leading role in the late 1980s and early 1990s, along with groups representing other minorities, in surveying and consulting on a new districting process for the City Council of New York City; according to some, these efforts resulted in the most diverse City Council since the 1930s. Dick Dadey served as first executive director from 1991-1997.
ESPA has been the driving force in negotiating New York City's comprehensive domestic partnership law, passing a statewide hate crimes law, repealing a 150-year old consensual sodomy statute, and enacting local non-discrimination laws and policies in Buffalo, Ithaca, Nassau County, and Westchester County. Each year, ESPA outlines legislative, electoral and organizing priorities for the state.
In 2012, ESPA received press attention when, approaching the end of Ross D. Levi's second year as executive director, it assigned his duties to his deputy Lynn Faria pending a long-term replacement.
ESPA is a member of the Equality Federation.
History.
In June 1994, ESPA, along with the New York City chapter of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, produced a full-page advertisement in the "New York Times" to counteract the "religious right" portrayal of us as "a scary specter"; more than 1,000 gay and lesbian New Yorkers came out about their non-heterosexuality.
In 1994, ESPA joined a network of liberal and progressive groups to counteract the "right-wing" Christian Right's "stealth strategy" to getting people elected to local school boards by "hiding their opposition to critical thinking, bilingual programs, multicultural education, and ultimately to public schooling itself". In 1996, ESPA joined the Freedom to Marry Coalition (Marriage Project). In 1997, ESPA helped educate advocates on how to push for hate-crimes legislation.
In 1998, ESPA launched "Pride in the Pulpit," a program to combat the use of religion to advance anti-LGBT amendments and legislation; in 2005, more than 450 non-LGBT religious leaders participated.
In 1999, ESPA Co-Chair Jeff Soref was named a part of "Out" magazine's "Out 100" for his work with ESPA and his efforts to push for a rule change to provide gays and lesbians more representation at the 2000 convention of the Democratic National Committee. In the early 2000s, ESPA, together with a local Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, convened the Dignity for All Students Coalition, bringing fifty community groups together to work on anti-bullying and anti-discrimination legislation.
ESPA was a strong advocate for a 2000 hate crimes law that provided enhanced criminal penalties for crimes motivated by hatred on the basis of sexual orientation.
In 2001 and 2002, ESPA worked to ensure that same-sex partners of September 11 attack victims received equal financial assistance, as many same-sex partners of those who perished in the attacks were initially denied any compensation. In October 2002, Governor George Pataki decreed that same-sex partners as well as unmarried partners of survivors would receive benefits equal to married partners, and on a national level, Senator Hillary Clinton called for coverage for those affected by the Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. attacks. Three bills that passed in 2002—each of which was advocated by ESPA—provided various benefits and protections to the surviving same-sex partners of individuals who perished in the September 11 attacks.
In December 2001, ESPA executive director Matt Foreman was recognized by U.S. Representative Jerrold Nadler for his work with ESPA since 1997. Foreman served as executive director of ESPA from 1997 to 2003, when he departed to become executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. In 2002, the New York State legislature passed Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act (SONDA) with ESPA being the "major lobbying muscle". SONDA was criticized for not covering transgendered individuals, but observers felt that the inclusion of gender identity as a protected category would make it impossible to pass the bill (which had first been introduced in 1971). In April 2004 was named as the new executive director. SONDA was passed in December 2002, not covering transgender people but "laying the foundation for winning full equality" according to Foreman. In October 2003, Carmen Vázquez, formerly of LGBT Community Center of NYC, was appointed deputy executive director of ESPA.
In June 2004, the annual "Equality at Work" awards honoring companies and individuals that work to create an "inclusive workspace that respects, welcomes and supports LGBT professionals" were launched. The 2005 recipients were American Express, "The Village Voice", Michael Fishman, president of 32BJ SEIU, and James Berg, president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations. The 2006 recipients were Merrill Lynch, Kodak, and Kym Ward Gaffney at Price Waterhouse Coopers.
ESPA helped pass an August 2004 law guaranteeing same-sex partners hospital visitation rights identical to those enjoyed by spouses and next-of-kin when caring for loved ones in hospitals and other facilities.
In October 2004, ESPA held its 13th Annual Fall Dinner with keynote speaker San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom; the Fall Dinner benefited the Empire State Pride Agenda Foundation, which is the non-partisan, 501(c)(3) research, education and advocacy arm of the organization. The ESPA Foundation, in partnership with the New York State Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health and Human Services Network, "developed and utilized education, advocacy and community organizing strategies to overcome the barriers of political and cultural opposition, inadequate knowledge about the health care needs of the community, and heterocentric models of healthcare" to obtain governmental health and wellness funds targeted for LGBT health needs. The effort resulted in $10.7 million in state funding for non-HIV/AIDS LGBT service needs, including primary care, preventative health needs, crime victim assistance, and support services for the state and for youth, seniors and people of color.
In 2005, ESPA helped to pass legislation providing same-sex partners the same authority as spouses when making decisions regarding the burial of a deceased partner.
In October 2005, ESPA joined the Lambda Legal Defense Fund and a coalition of anti-censorship groups to oppose a new zoning law that would shut down an estimated 149 adult-oriented bookstores, theaters and clubs including all of the businesses on Christopher Street.
In 2007, same-sex marriage legislation passed the New York State Assembly by a vote of 85-61. ESPA has been a leading supporter of same-sex marriage legislation in New York.
In 2008, the ESPA-supported Gender Expression Nondiscrimination Act passed the New York State Assembly for the first time.
On December 2, 2009, ESPA-supported same-sex marriage legislation failed in the New York State Senate by a vote of 24-38.
On May 14, 2010, a "New York Times" blog reported that ESPA was "poised to select" Brian Ellner as its next executive director. It was later reported that Ellner's past affiliation with Michael Bloomberg had been criticized by some ESPA supporters; for whatever reason, he withdrew his name from consideration, and on the 22nd ESPA instead announced appointing Ross D. Levi, an attorney, to the position. Levi had been a legislative assistant at the New York State Legislature starting in 1997 and part of ESPA's Albany staff since before 2000, and since 2006 had held its title as Director of Public Policy & Education.
On July 2, another reporter reported (on the same NYT blog) Ellner's appointment to head the "Campaign for New York Marriage", financed by Human Rights Campaign.
On April 20, 2011, New Yorkers United for Marriage was instituted as an alliance among ESPA, Marriage Equality New York, and the Human Rights Campaign.
A March 6, 2012, report stated that Levi had been "fired" the preceding day. The "Times" credited that as the first report, and suggested that ESPA board members felt Human Rights Campaign's work under Ellner had caught attention to the detriment of ESPA's role.
Same-Sex Marriage Lobbying.
At the ESPA Fall Dinner held on October 22, 2009, then-Executive Director Alan Van Capelle publicly expressed great frustration that state senators supported by the group—some of whom Van Capelle mentioned by name—had not yet passed legislation on same-sex marriage. At a “couldn’t-be-higher stakes” November 2010 meeting with Governor David Paterson and other elected officials who supported the same-sex marriage bill, Senate Democratic Leader John Sampson and Senator Jeff Klein “did not mince words in letting Van Capelle know they were upset by” his critical comments at the Fall Dinner.
ESPA was regarded as the driving force behind a failed December 2009 Senate vote on same-sex marriage legislation. In late 2010, Governor David Paterson was asked what would have to occur in order for same-sex marriage to be legalized in New York. Paterson responded, "Get rid of the lobbyists," and added that same-sex marriage lobbyists had “literally forced” a Senate vote prematurely in December 2009.

13th Olympic Congress

The 13th Olympic Congress was held on 3–5 October 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark, by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The city of Copenhagen was chosen in 8 February by the 118th IOC Session held in Turin, Italy to stage the 13th Olympic Congress, together with the meetings of the Executive Board and the 121st IOC Session. The other candidates were Athens (Greece), Busan (South Korea), Cairo (Egypt), Riga (Latvia), Singapore (Singapore), and Taipei (Chinese Taipei). Convened on the initiative of President Jacques Rogge, the 13th Olympic Congress brought together all the constituent parties of the Olympic Movement to study and discuss the current functioning of the Movement and define the main development axes for the future. "This will be an important milestone and a chance for the entire Olympic family to discuss and debate some major issues around the role of the Olympic Movement in society. How can we use digital technologies to communicate the values of Olympism? How do we better connect with young people? What can we all do to encourage people to lead active, healthy lifestyles? These are just some of the questions we will grapple with at the Congress. Getting at some answers won't be easy, but is very necessary." said Jacques Rogge. President Rogge underlined in his short address the role sport and the Olympic Movement play in society. "Sport has played, plays and will always play, an important role worldwide." According to Rogge, the IOC and all other members of the Olympic Movement will seize the opportunity of the 13th Congress in Copenhagen to demonstrate what has already been achieved in this field, that the Movement is committed to fully playing its role and that it is taking up every challenge in order to set the bar even higher.
The 13th Olympic Congress was held from 3 to 5 October 2009 in the Danish capital. It brought together around 1,000 participants representing: IOC members; IOC honorary and honour members; representatives of the International Federations, National Olympic Committees, the athletes and Organising Committees for the Olympic Games; athletes and athlete support staff (coaches, doctors and medical staff); referees, judges and technical officials; the IOC’s Olympic partners; and the media. The various stages of the Olympic Congress run from 1 July 2007 until the end of 2009. The meetings in Copenhagen will mark the culmination of this process. But even then, the work will not be finished, as the next task will be to implement the main Congress recommendations that the Session has accepted. The first meeting of the 2009 Congress Commission, which is chaired by President Rogge, and includes the entire membership of the EB, met for the first time this morning to start the process that will lead to the 13th Olympic Congress in Copenhagen in October 2009. The 13th Olympic Congress will include a public consultation for the first time in the history of Olympic congresses. The Chairman of the Congress Organising Committee and President of the National Olympic Committee of Denmark, IOC member Kai Holm, is convinced that the Olympic Congress will strengthen Denmark's ties with the sports world, especially the various International Federations and the National Olympic Committees around the world. "Such an opening allows us to exchange points of view, learn from each other and establish contacts which will be valuable for years to come", he believes. Through this consultation, a list of sixty-six recommendations to strength and improve the Olympic Movement was published.

Mosquefal

The Mosquefal M968 (MQ M968) is a variant of the earlier 1908 DWM Brazilian Mauser rifle; differentiated from this by its lighter weight, shorter barrel, curved bolt, and by the caliber. The M908 was chambered for the 7x57mm Mauser cartridge, then popular throughout Latin America. The M968 is chambered for the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge, to allow compatibility with the FN FAL, the Brazilian service rifle. This model is manufactured in Itajubá, Minas Gerais by IMBEL. The name is a portmanteau of "mosquetão" and FAL, noting the bolt-action rifle's compatibility with the ammunition and accessories of the assault rifle.
This weapon is used in various auxiliary units of the Brazilian Army. The M968 was developed from the Mosquetão .30 M954 (caliber .30-06 Springfield) now in disuse in the Brazilian Army) which was rechambered and issued with minor external modifications. The MQ M968 has features similar to the M964 7.62 (FN FAL), allowing use of the same ammunition and grenade-firing attachments.
Ammunition.
The use of special ammunition for Snipers, with balanced and heavier projectile (175 or 180 grains) increases the accuracy of firing at larger distances.
It is a precision weapon, which, beyond the basic training of the Army shooters (Tiros de Guerra) is also used by police forces throughout the country.

<doc id="21603604" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21603604" title="Technical peer review">
Technical peer review

In engineering, technical peer review is a type of engineering review. Technical peer reviews are a well defined review process for finding and fixing defects, conducted by a team of peers with assigned roles. Technical peer reviews are carried out by peers representing areas of life cycle affected by material being reviewed (usually limited to 6 or fewer people). Technical peer reviews are held within development phases, between milestone reviews, on completed products or completed portions of products.
A technical peer review may also be called a "engineering peer review", a "product peer review", a "peer review/inspection" or an "inspection."
Overview.
The purpose of technical peer reviews is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. By removing defects at their origin (e.g., requirements and design documents, test plans and procedures, software code, etc.), technical peer reviews prevent defects from propagating through multiple phases and work products, and reduce the overall amount of rework necessary on projects.
In addition, improved team efficiency is a side effect of technical peer reviews (e.g., by improving team communication, integrating the viewpoints of various engineering specialty disciplines, more quickly bringing new members up to speed, and educating project members about effective development practices).
In CMMI, peer reviews are used as a principal means of verification in the Verification process area and as an objective evaluation method in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area. The results of technical peer reviews can be reported at milestone reviews. (See Milestone (project management).)
Roles of participants.
Responsible for conducting the technical peer review process and collecting inspection data. Plays key role in all stages of the technical peer review process except rework. Required to perform several duties during a technical peer review in addition to inspector’s tasks.
Responsible for finding defects in work product from a general point of view, as well as defects that affect their area of expertise.
Provides information about work product during all stages of process. Responsible for correcting all major defects and any minor and trivial defects that cost and schedule permit. Performs duties of an inspector.
Guides team through work product during the technical peer review meeting. Reads or paraphrases work product in
detail. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to reader’s role.
Accurately records each defect found during inspection meeting on the Inspection Defect List. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to recorder’s role.
Vested interest of reviewers.
There are two philosophies about the vested interest of the inspectors in the product under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a vested interest in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the project
who do not have a vested interest in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team. 
Each inspector is invited to disclose vested interests to the rest of the technical peer review panel so the Moderator can exercise sound judgement in evaluating the inspector's inputs.
Distinction from other types of technical review.
Peer reviews are distinct from management reviews, which are conducted by management representatives rather than by colleagues, and for management and control purposes rather than for technical evaluation. They are also distinct from software audit reviews, which are conducted by personnel external to the project, to evaluate compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other criteria.
A software peer review is a type of technical peer review. The IEEE defines formal structures, roles, and processes for software peer reviews.
Management involvement.
Management representatives are typically not involved in the conduct of a peer review. This is especially true of line managers of the author or other participants in the review. A policy of encouraging management to stay out of peer reviews encourages the peer review team to concentrate on the product being reviewed and not on the people or personalities involved.
Detailed instructions.
For detailed instructions on conducting a technical peer review/inspection, see NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, Appendix N.

Rocksavage

Rocksavage or Rock Savage was an Elizabethan mansion, now in ruins, at in Clifton (now a district of Runcorn), Cheshire, England. Built for Sir John Savage, MP in 1565–8, Rocksavage was one of the great Elizabethan houses of the county; in 1674, it was the second largest house in Cheshire. James I visited in 1617. The house was abandoned when it passed into the Cholmondeley family early in the 18th century, and by 1782 only ruins remained. 
Rocksavage was a sandstone quadrangle around a central courtyard, with paired octagonal towers flanking the main entrance. Only fragments of its garden and orchard walls are still standing; they are listed at grade II.
History.
The Savage family were important Cheshire landowners from the late 1370s, when the family acquired lands at Clifton by the marriage of John Savage (d. 1386) to Margaret Danyers. Sir John Savage (d. 1597/8) was the seneschal of Halton Castle, and also served at various times as a member of parliament for Cheshire, mayor of Chester and High Sheriff of Cheshire. Rocksavage was built for him on a hillside overlooking the River Weaver. Started in around 1565, the house was completed in 1568. Rocksavage was one of the great Elizabethan "prodigy houses" of Cheshire. Hearth-tax assessments of 1674 show that it was the second largest house in the county, its fifty hearths being surpassed only by Cholmondeley House. An early 17th century description praised the mansion's "magnificent fabric". The medieval family seat of Clifton Hall stood nearby, and was retained as farm and service buildings.
James I dined at Rocksavage with his retinue on 21 August 1617 on his way to Vale Royal Abbey and Chester. During the Civil War, John Savage, Earl Rivers, declared for the royalist side. Rocksavage was ransacked by parliamentarian forces, and the roof and part of the walls were destroyed. The first Duke of Monmouth stayed at Rocksavage on 13 September 1682 as a guest of Thomas Savage, Earl Rivers, while touring Cheshire to assess support for a faction opposed to Charles II.
The estate passed by marriage to James Barry, Earl of Barrymore, in the early 18th century. Further buildings were constructed higher up the hill by the Earl of Barrymore, possibly by the architect Henry Sephton. Now known as Clifton Hall, these might have been intended as a replacement for Rocksavage or as service buildings for the main mansion. A few years after these buildings were erected, Rocksavage was abandoned when the Barrymore heiress married into the Cholmondeley family and the principal seat of the joint estate became Cholmondeley House. (The marquesses of Cholmondeley retain "Earl of Rocksavage" as a courtesy title for the heir.) The empty house soon decayed and was already in ruins by 1782.
Description.
The design of the Elizabethan mansion was a quadrangle of four bays in the local red sandstone, built around a central courtyard, and was symmetrical but not classical. The main entrance was a gateway flanked by octagonal towers with domed tops and bridged by a crenellated wall. The towers are prominent in an engraving of the ruins, after Peter de Wint, which dates from around 1818 and appears in George Ormerod's "The History of the County Palatine and City of Chester". Brereton Hall, built some twenty years later by Sir John Savage's ward and son-in-law Sir William Brereton, was modelled on Rocksavage and copied its paired octagonal towers. Unlike Brereton Hall, the string courses of the Rocksavage towers extended around the adjoining walls. 
The last major remnant of the house fell in around 1980. Only the orchard gateposts and fragments of garden and orchard walls now remain near the M56 Weaver Viaduct in Runcorn; they are listed at grade II.
The 18th-century Clifton Hall was originally a U-shaped brick building with prominent stone pilasters. One arm of the U has been demolished and the remnant is now surrounded by farm buildings.

The temple was built by Hemadri, the minister of the Yadava King Ramachandra. The Jain style construction has led to debates about the origins of the temple, since the Kadamba Dynasty ruled Goa between the tenth and fourteenth centuries. The temple is built in the Hemadpanthi style from basalt, carried across the mountains from the Deccan plateau and carved craftsmen. It is considered to be the only specimen of Kadamba-Yadava architecture in basalt stone preserved and available in Goa. The temple survived invasions and the Goa Inquisition due to its remote location in a clearing deep in the forest at the foot of the Western Ghats which surround the site.
Religious significance and decoration.
The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is reminiscent of the temples at Aihole in neighbouring Karnataka. There is a linga (symbol of Lord Shiva) mounted on a pedestal inside the inner sanctum, and local legend has it that a huge king cobra is in permanent residence in the dimly lit interior. 
The temple consists of garbhagriha, antarala and a pillared Nandi mandapa built of basalt. The four pillars, embellished with intricate carvings of elephants and chains support a stone ceiling decorated with finely carved Ashtoken lotus flowers.
The intricate carvings created by skilled craftsmen adorn the interior and the sides of the building. Bas-relief figures of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma, with their respective consorts appear on panels at the sides of the temple. Unusually, the mandap (pillared hall) is covered with a roof of plain grey sloping slabs. The temple faces east so that the first rays of the rising sun shine on the deity. There is a small mandap and the inner sanctum is surmounted by a three-tired tower whose top is incomplete or has been dismantled sometime in the distant past. 
There is a headless Nandi (bull, Shiva's vehicle) in the centre of the mandap, surrounded by four matching columns. The symbol of the Kadamba kingdom, an elephant trampling a horse is carved on the base of one of the columns. The river Surla flows nearby and is reachable for ritual bathing by a flight of stone steps.
The festival of Mahashivratri is celebrated with pomp and gaiety at the temple by local people residing in surrounding villages. The temple is built in a place which is quite inaccessible and away from the main settlements of the time. The temple is small compared to the average Goan temple.
Location.
The temple is at near a small village called Tambdi Surla located east of Bolcornem village, in the north east region of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park. 
Mahadev Temple is approximately from the capital city of Panaji. It is accessible from the north via minor roads south from the main town of Valpoi in Sattari Taluka. The temple is at the foot of the Anmod Ghat, which connects Goa to the state of Karnataka.

Delhi Bus Rapid Transit System

The Delhi Bus Rapid Transit System is a bus rapid transit in Delhi. The first route opened in 2008 ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games which were held in the city. The project is well used but has been criticized for the difficulty of access to the bus platforms, which are in the middle of the road, for lack of enforcement and for the effect it has had on other motor traffic. A legal challenge was defeated in 2012.
BRT is being developed alongside the Delhi Metro, which started operation in 2002.
History.
Context.
The number of vehicles on Delhi’s road increased from 3.3 million in 2000–01 to 7 million in 2010–11; however, less than 10% people in Delhi use private cars, with 33% traveling by bus and 30% walking to work.
The length of roads in Delhi has increased by 17% between 1991 and 2008 with now flyovers and underpasses have been built to improve traffic flow; the Ring Road has been made completely signal-free with the construction of 15 flyovers. The Delhi Metro opened its first section in 2002 and now carries 2.06 million passengers each day (as of 2011).
Pedestrians became marginalized and journey times and air pollution both increased. In 2002, Supreme Court issued an order to convert all diesel buses to compressed natural gas (CNG) to reduce air pollution; however, average total suspended particulate (TSP) level is still considerably higher than World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendations. There is little opportunity to build new roads or widen existing roads, which already make up 21% of the land area.
Planning and construction.
The Delhi BRT system was inspired by a similar systems in Curitiba, Brazil which had been introduced a system in 1975, with similar systems being introduced in Bogotá, Colombia (TransMilenio), Guayaquil, Ecuador (Metrovia) and the Eugene, Oregon (Emerald Express (EmX)).
GNCTD appointed RITES and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi) to design and implement a system for the city in 2004. TRIPP IIT Delhi were appointed as technical and conceptual advisors.
GNCTD create the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) in 2006 to oversee the establishment of public transport systems in Delhi and operate it on a day-to-day basis.
Operation.
The first route, from Dr. Ambedkar Nagar to the south to Delhi Gate in the centre of the city, passes through some of the prime 'colonies' (urban districts) in South Delhi and is also on the main road from Delhi to the large commercial developments in Gurgaon. An trial section of the first route started in operation 20 April 2008 from Dr. Ambedkar Nagar to Moolchand; construction work for the full length started in October 2008.
Legal challenge and 'mixed-use'.
The city delayed implementation of a further 14 fast-track bus corridors in response to the level of controversy created by the first scheme.
The legality of the system was challenged in 2012. During the nine month long legal challenge the Delhi High Court initially ruled that private vehicles should be allowed the use the bus lanes on a temporarily basis and ordered the government to review the feasibility of the project. The Delhi government appealed to the Supreme Court of India against the ruling in July 2012, but was unsuccessful. The high court subsequently ruled in favour of the scheme concluding that "a developed country is not one where the poor own cars. It is one where the rich use public transport".
Design and operation.
The 14.5 km long corridor from Ambedkar Nagar to Delhi Gate runs along a right of way which varying from 28 meters to 51.5 meters wide. Buses use a bus lane is in the middle of the road which is 3.3 meters wide with general purpose motor vehicle lanes with a width of 6.75 meters to each side. Separate lanes are also provided for non-motorized vehicles, including pedestrians, cycles and rickshaws etc. Buses run at the same level as normal traffic and share the same traffic signals.
Bus passengers need to access the bus platforms in the middle of the road by crossing the busy general purpose traffic lanes. Electronic Passenger information system displays are available in all bus shelters with the new low-floor buses on four routes – 419, 423, 521 and 522 being fitted with GPS tracking.
The first route crosses 6 key intersections, including Chirag Delhi, which is one of the busiest in Delhi and also the congested Moolchand instersection. More than 1.35 million vehicles of all types cross the junction in a typical 16-hour day. Approximately 200-250 buses which cross the junction each peak hour carry some 11,000-12,000 passengers (which is 55-60% of the total people movements). A further some 15-20% of people use private vehicles including cars, two wheelers and auto rickshaws and make up 90% of the traffic. Cars/Jeeps constitute around 35-40% of total motorized vehicles.
180 road marshals are deployed on the corridor to guide bus passengers, help children and old people to cross the road, manage traffic, instruct people to follow traffic rules and perform other corridor management activities. The company employs security guards at the bus platforms on a 24-hour basis.
The Operational Control Centre (OCC) at Kashmere Gate and a camp office at DTC Khan Pur Depot monitor the daily progress. A crane is available to remove disabled vehicles from the corridor. On average there are 3 vehicles break down on the corridor each day. Disabled vehicles including buses are typically removed in about 10 minutes.
Usage and performance.
More than 60% of commuters use BRT Corridor mainly for work. Most of the respondents showed their discontent with the previous public transportation system. Respondents preferred to use their private vehicles due to inflexibility and unreliability of the bus system (according to a DIMTS commissioned socio-economic survey at BRT Corridor). More than 50% of respondents desired "timeliness of bus service", "clean bus and well behaved staff" and "certainty of bus service". 85% of the respondents, who were currently not using public transport system, showed their willingness to use new BRT system if it is good.
In 2012 it was reported that 70% of users were moving faster and there has been a 32% increase in bus ridership.
Proposed development.
A total 26 BRT corridors are planned, covering a total length of 310 km by the year 2020. This will be in addition to more than 400 km of metro train coverage by 2020 and further coverage by Monorail and Light Rail.
Criticism.
Lack of enforcement.
Frustrated vehicle owners choose to violate rules with impunity by using the bus lane, defeating the very purpose of BRT. With negligible prosecution, the entire concept of a BRT falls flat. ""BRT as a concept is good, but the success of the corridor depends on how it is implemented. In its present form, it is congested and a large number of violations occur on the stretch that are not punished. This compromises the sanctity of the corridor. People have to be prosecuted on the spot to discourage violations. We have received complaints of pile-ups on the non-BRT lane and the long signal cycle adds to the delay in smooth crossover on the stretch,"" says joint commissioner of police (traffic) Satyendra Garg.
Difficulty accessing bus platforms.
Not only the private car owners but the bus users too complain about bad planning. Despite the claims of DIMTS, the agency in-charge of the stretch, bus users say they are forced to scamper across the stretch to cross between the bus stands and the pavement. Without proper underpasses from the central median, where passengers get down or board the bus, a passenger does not know how to reach the bus stop as it's in the middle of the road. Not only are there no proper pedestrian crossings for road users on the BRT, the maintenance of the stretch is so poor that most of the safety markers, like bollards and speedbreakers, are broken and in a state of severe disrepair.
Explains KK Kapila, Chairman of International Road Federation (IRF), a Geneva-based global body for road safety: ""At present the buses run in the middle of the road with cars and motorised traffic on narrow left lanes. Since the bus stands are in middle of the road, the scurrying passengers have to board or get off the bus in the middle of the road and have to scuttle to safety towards pavements through the regular traffic lane. This is not the full-scale BRT system followed abroad.""
Longer traffic signal cycle times.
At regular traffic intersections, commuters have to wait for transit of traffic along the three other arms of the intersection before getting a green signal. On BRT, the signal cycle is far more convoluted and, as a result, much longer.
""As opposed to normal traffic intersections, there are six different movements of vehicles along the arms of the intersection. The two extra movements are that of the buses on the BRT lane, which means that all commuters using the BRT or even passing through have to wait much longer. As the waiting time increases, the traffic tail lengthens much more than it normally would and there is a corresponding ripple effect on traffic,"" points out a senior traffic police officer.
This means that commuters are unable to cross the intersection in one signal cycle. "It takes me at least three green lights to cross each signal of the BRT. Even during non-peak hours, I am stuck in a never-ending jam. Sometimes, I feel like banging my car in frustration. I can walk faster in this corridor," says a much hassled Ratika Dang, an interior designer.
The BRT has created further choke points creating almost half km long backups since 2008.
Road safety.
Increasing vehicle population is co-related with road accidents: every year road accidents cost India about 3% of its gross domestic product, which was more than $1 trillion in 2007.

Gringo (album)

Gringo is the seventh studio album released by the Ohio rock band Circus Devils in 2009. All songs on Gringo were written and performed by Robert Pollard, Todd Tobias, and Tim Tobias. The first all-acoustic album released by Circus Devils, "Gringo" is a song cycle in which each track recounts a moment in the life of a nameless drifter known only as "the Gringo." The moods on the album range widely between jubilant to melancholy to mean. 
Reaction.
"Musically the album is filled with creepy film-score interludes and art-rock grinders, but also pretty and strange acoustic balladry. Like every Circus Devils album, it feels haunted, but those ghosts do less screaming and more gentle creeping and following. And of course, nothing is as it seems. There’s a lot to savor and decipher throughout. 
With Gringo, you can get lulled into comfort, but then you’ll be stabbed in the face." 
– Dave Heaton for Erasing Clouds
"The latest from Circus Devils once again proves that this vehicle has no rules, boundaries or expectations. This seventh release tells the story of Gringo in a simple, mostly acoustic form that still embraces the Circus Devils love for eclectic background noises but is their most straightforward set of accessible songs to date. You can call Gringo a statement, a step forward, a step backwards, or just the right step but the Circus Devils finalize the notion that trying to put a label on them remains impossible and that is what makes them worth seeking out!"

The Distance (Taylor Hicks album)

The Distance is the third studio album by American blue-eyed soul singer Taylor Hicks, released on March 10, 2009. It is the first release by Hicks under his own independent label, Modern Whomp, after parting ways with Arista Records.
"The Distance" was produced by Simon Climie and features eleven tracks on the main version, including the single "What's Right Is Right" and "Nineteen", which tells the story of a teenage football star who joins the armed forces after the 9/11 attacks. Several tracks feature Nathan East and Doyle Bramhall II, both longtime members of Eric Clapton's band. "Seven Mile Breakdown" was originally recorded by Alabama indie band Spoonful James. It debuted at number 58 on the Billboard 200 and number five on the Top Independent Albums charts with sales of 9,000 copies in its first week of release.
Reception.
Critical reception to the album was mixed to positive, with publications like Allmusic saying that "Hicks doesn't show great sensitivity as an interpreter(...) but as an entertainer he pulls out all the stops, determined to get every last person in the joint to crack a smile. It's a trait that served him well in those small clubs and on television, and it still serves him well here." Entertainment Weekly, however, gave the album a decidedly negative review, with Entertainment Weekly writer Simon Levinson stating that Hicks is "no worse than any of the countless other graying dudes singing what they believe to be the blues in hotel lobbies and dive bars across the nation".
Chart performance.
The album sold approximately 9,000 copies in the US during its first official week of released; debuting at number 58 on the "Billboard" 200 and number five on the Top Independent Albums chart. It has sold 52,000 copies to date.

List of Hong Kong music awards

This is a partial list of award ceremonies that recognize achievements in Hong Kong's popular music industry. In January 2001, IFPI Hong Kong had considered for a music award that would have similar categories to American Grammy Awards and British Brit Awards, but the event has yet to be held as of 2014.
The Four Major Awards.
Each year Hong Kong's four main media outlets; RTHK, TVB, CRHK, and Metro Radio; hold their own music award ceremonies. These are the four music awards that are given the most attention by the media, fans, and record companies.
Metro Radio Music Awards.
Metro Radio's music awards (新城勁爆頒獎禮) is usually the first of the four major music award ceremonies and is considered "music's first report card". The awards ceremony always takes place on December 26, Boxing Day. Metro Radio is known for giving out the most number of awards, with the number of awards increasing almost every year. In 2000 they gave out 53 awards, but in 2008 they gave out 137 awards. The awards have been held at number of different venues throughout the years. In recent years they have been held at HKCEC Hall 3, but in 2008, it moved to the newly opened AsiaWorld Arena.
Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation.
CRHK's music awards (叱咤樂壇流行榜) is usually the second major music awards ceremony of the year. Awards are determined by airplay on CRHK's FM 90.3 CR2 (based on spins). Spins for songs are only counted if they chart for that particular week (meaning if they make it on the station's weekly Top 20 chart). The awards ceremony are held on January 1, New Year's Day, every year. The awards have been held at number of different venues throughout the years including the Hong Kong Coliseum and Hong Kong Stadium. In recent years, they have been held at HKCEC Hall 3, but in 2007, like Metro Radio Music Awards, the award was held at AsiaWorld Arena instead.
The only awards that are not determined by airplay are the four "My Favourite" awards, which are determined by votes from the public. The process in which votes are collected have changed throughout the years. Currently, the "My Favourite Male, Female, and Group" awards are determined by an official poll online. For the first round of voting, fans get to choose from a large list of nominees. The five artists with the most scores are then picked from the long list of nominees, and then the public gets to choose from the top 5 for the second round of voting. The top 5 nominees for the "My Favourite Song" award is also collected through online votes, but then for the final round votes are collected and counted on site at the awards ceremony.
Due to the fact that CRHK's award ceremonies are determined by airplay, netizens compile the songs played on the station everyday. The play counts are then posted on a number of online discussion forums and web sites. While the actual outcome is usually similar to what is compiled by fans online, there are always some differences. But CRHK claims that this is only because the radio station calculate airplay differently from fans.
Jade Solid Gold Top Ten Songs Music Awards.
Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation, presented by TVB, is usually the third of the four major music awards held every year. The awards ceremony is generally held in early to mid January. Even though CRHK's music awards are generally given the most hype and attention, while in recent years, TVB's method of determining the winners have been questioned by fans, TVB's "Most Popular Male/Female" and "Gold Song Gold" awards are still seen as some of the most prestigious music awards in Hong Kong. The awards ceremony was held at the Hong Kong Coliseum annually, except for the 2008 edition which was held at Star Hall. Since 2011, the award's venue was moved to TVB City.
RTHK's Top Ten Chinese Songs Music Awards.
RTHK's music awards is usually the last of the four major Hong Kong music awards. The awards ceremony has the longest history out of four major awards, and thus, is one of the most prestigious, giving out its first award in 1978. The awards ceremony gives out a number of big awards every year including the Top 10 Golden songs, the Nation's most favourite male and females, and, most importantly, its Golden Song Award. To qualify for a Top 10 Golden Song award, a song must finish in the top 3 in RTHK's Radio 2 Weekly Countdown which ranks the most popular songs every week. Fans and critics alike both vote for their favourite songs and artists right before the ceremony to determine which awards are given to whom. 
Its "Golden Needle" award is generally seen as the most prestigious lifetime achievement award in the Hong Kong music industry. A list of past RTHK Awards can be found here: RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. Since RTHK is the last of the four ceremonies, it is also the ceremony that awards the 4 Stations Joint Music Awards.
Four Stations Joint Music Awards.
Every year, Hong Kong's four major media outlets also give out four "joint awards" given out by all four stations.
Other award ceremonies.
The only music awards based purely on quality, these awards are given by the "Composers and Authors Society of Hong Kong Ltd."
These awards are given out by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. The awards are usually based on album sales of both local and international music, but after four major record labels withdrew from IFPI in August 2008, almost all of the awards are given to local record companies.

<doc id="21604048" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21604048" title="Edo society">
Edo society

Society during the Edo period (or Tokugawa period) in Japan was ruled by strict customs and regulations intended to promote stability. Confucian ideas provided the foundation for a system of strict social prescriptions. At the top of the social order, though below emperor, shogun, and daimyo (lords), were the samurai who functioned as the ruling class. Second most praised were the peasants ("heimin"), who lived in villages and produced agricultural goods. Increasing urbanization and rising consumerism created merchant and artisan classes in towns and cities. Social mobility during this period was highly limited. As wealth became concentrated outside of the samurai class, conflicts between class arose and the social order became increasingly challenged.
Four class order.
The Tokugawa government intentionally created a social order called the Four divisions of society ("Shinokosho"), that would stabilize the country. This system was based on the ideas of Confucianism that spread to Japan from China. By this system, society was composed of samurai (士 "shi"), farming peasants (農 "nō"), artisans (工 "kō") and merchants (商 "shō"). Samurai were placed at the top of society because they started an order and set a high moral example for others to follow. This system was meant to reinforce their position of power in society by justifying their ruling status. Peasants came second because they produced the most important commodity, food. According to Confucian philosophy, society could not survive without agriculture. Third were artisans because they produced non-essential goods. Merchants were at the bottom of the social order because they generated wealth without producing any goods. As this indicates, the classes were not arranged by wealth or capital but by what philosophers described as their moral purity.
In actuality, "shinokosho" does not accurately describe Tokugawa society. Buddhist and Shinto priests; or court nobles (kuge); and outcast classes including "eta" and "hinin" (those sold or sentenced into indentured servitude) were not included in this description of hierarchy. In some cases, a poor samurai could be little better off than a peasant and the lines between the classes could blur, especially between artisans and merchants in urban areas. Still, this theory provided grounds for restricting privileges and responsibilities to different classes and it gave a sense of order to society. In practice, solidified social relationships in general helped create the political stability that defined the Edo period. 
Samurai.
Samurai functioned as the warrior class in Japan; they constituted about 7-8% of the population. The other classes were prohibited from possessing weapons. Carrying two swords became the symbol of the samurai class. 
During the feudal period, samurai were warriors that fought for a lord in a feudal relationship. The Edo period, however, was largely free from both external threats and internal conflicts. Instead the samurai maintained their fighting skills more as an art than to fight. Samurai were paid a stipend from their lord, limiting their ties to the economic base. In addition, samurai were limited from owning land which would have given them income independent from their duty. Samurai generally lived around their daimyo's castle, creating a thriving town or city environment around the political center of a domain.
There were social stratifications within the samurai class. Upper-level samurai had direct access to their daimyo and could hold his most trusted positions. Some achieved a level of wealth that allowed them to retain their own samurai vassals. Mid-level samurai held military and bureaucratic positions and had some interactions with their daimyo if needed. Low level samurai could be paid as little as a subsistence wage and worked as guards, messengers and clerks. Positions within the class were largely hereditary and talented samurai were limited in rising only a few social steps beyond their birth, if anything. Outside the traditional samurai-lord relationship were "ronin", or masterless samurai. These samurai were generally afforded very low levels of respect, had no income, and often became gamblers, bandits, or other similar occupations.
Peasants.
Life for rural peasants focused on their villages. Peasants rarely moved beyond their villages and journeys and pilgrimages required a permit, though young people occasionally sought seasonal employment outside of their village. As a result, people were highly suspicious of outsiders. Social bonding, critical to the survival of the whole village, was also reinforced through seasonal festivals. Villages were highly collective; there were strong pressures to conform and no room to deviate from custom. Though there were conflicts, these were seen as disruptive to the village and order and were to be limited as much as possible.
The peasant class owned land, though rights to tax this land were given to the daimyo. Peasants worked to produce enough food for themselves and still meet the tax burden. Most agriculture during this time was cultivated by families on their own land in contrast to the plantation or "hacienda" model that was implemented elsewhere. Peasants could amass relatively large amounts of wealth but remained in the same class because of their association with the land. Wealthier families and those that held their own land and paid taxes were held in much higher regard and had more political influence in village matters. However, the survival of the village depended on every household cooperating to meet the tax burden and overcome natural disasters such as famines.
Merchants and artisans.
By 1800 as much as 10% of the population of Japan may have lived in large towns and cities, one of the highest levels in the world at the time. The daimyo and their samurai did not produce any goods themselves, but they used the tax surplus from the land to fuel their consumption. These needs were met by artisans, who moved to be around the castles, and merchants, who traded local and regional goods. Each class in the city was restricted to living in its own quarter.
Merchants grew increasingly powerful during this period. Wealthy merchant houses arose to organize distributors and hold legal monopolies. As their wealth grew, merchants wanted to consume and display their wealth in the same manner as the samurai, but laws prevented them from doing so in an overt fashion. Still, their consumption combined with that of the samurai served to reinforce the growth of the merchant and artisan classes.
Role of women.
A woman's life varied greatly according to her family's social status. Women in samurai families were expected to submit to their male heads of household but as they aged they could become the ranking household member if their husband died. Children were enjoined to respect both of their parents, even as they became adults. Women from the lower classes were much less restricted by social expectations and could play an integral part in the family's business. Peasant women were expected to do household chores in the early morning before working in the fields with their male relatives; peasant women of all ages were important, working members of their families.
Marriage during this time was not based on romantic attraction. Families tried to use marriage as a way to increase their social standing or, among wealthier groups, to increase one's influence and holdings. Most often, however, marriage occurred between two families of equal status. Female virginity at marriage was important in the samurai classes; it was much less important to the lower classes. After marriage, women were restricted from taking additional sexual partners. Males of the upper classes, however, were able to take concubines and have relations with unmarried women. Divorce was not uncommon and a woman from a poor household could easily leave her husband and return to her original family.
Challenges to the social order.
The foundation of this period was its stable social order. However, as wealth became increasingly concentrated outside of the samurai class, social conflict grew. The fixed stipends on which samurai lived did not increase despite the rising cost of commodities and the ever more burdensome cost of proper social etiquette. As a result many samurai became in debt to wealthy merchant families. These wealthy merchants, in turn, were restricted from showing their wealth for fear of violating the laws that restricted privileges to the samurai class. This created deepening resentment but also increasing interdependence between the two classes. Some scholars began to question the Confucian beliefs that provided the foundation of society.
Changes in rural areas were also creating conflict. New technology increased productivity and allowed some families to produce a surplus of food that could be used to support ventures beyond farming. Some peasants also became indebted to their wealthier neighbors and an increasing number of families lost ownership of their land. This sparked resentment that at times erupted in violence towards landlords and village elite.
These social stresses laid the foundation for the changes that would follow during the Meiji period.

Carondelet Palace

Carondelet Palace () is the seat of government of the Republic of Ecuador, located in Quito. Access is by the public space known as Independence Square or Plaza Grande (colloquial name), around which are also the Archbishop's Palace, Municipal Palace, Hotel Plaza Grande, and Metropolitan Cathedral.
History.
The history of this emblematic building dating back to colonial times, around 1570, with the acquisition of the former royal houses located in the city of Quito.
First Royal Houses.
The first seat of the Spanish Crown in the Royal Audience of Quito functioned near the convent of La Merced (current Cuenca and Chile streets) until around the year 1611, when dies Diego Suarez de Figueroa, secretary of the audience, who owned a small palace built in the central square (Plaza Grande).
Juan Fernandez de Recalde, president of the Audience then informed the king that the building was finished, and it was purchased by the Crown as a larger building to house the comfortable premises of the Spanish Administration in Quito soil.
Some time later, the successor to President Recalde, Antonio de Morga, informed the king that the royal houses were unworthy to carry that name, because they were close and very old, so they proposed to buy the adjacent houses. The earthquake of 1627 forced them to buy the neighboring buildings that, by their age, were rebuilt in stone and brick. Thereafter, the power of the audience settled in front of the Plaza Grande.
The New Palace.
In 1799, the Barón Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet was appointed chairman of the hearing. In 1801, the Spanish engaged to Antonio Garcia, under his direction, perform work of rehabilitation and improvements, both at the Palace of the audience at the Cathedral as well; also led the work on the arches of the sewers and the renovation of the Prison building.
After the independence of Ecuador culminated with the Battle of Pichincha in 1822, the palace became the headquarters of the South Department of Gran Colombia, receiving the liberator Simón Bolívar sometimes, who wondered at the elegance and austerity of the building in addition to being delighted with the taste of the Baron of Carondelet (main thrust of the work); thus, Bolivar gave the building the name of Carondelet Palace.
The Republican Carondelet.
During the Republican era, almost all the presidents (constitutional, internees and dictators) have dispatched from this building, which is the seat of Government of the Republic of Ecuador.
There has been some changes over the years, the most important in the presidencies of Gabriel García Moreno, Camilo Ponce Enríquez and Sixto Durán Ballén.
In addition to the administrative units in the third level of the Palace is the presidential residence, a luxurious colonial-style apartment in which they live the President and his family.
Currently, the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the Republic and the Ministry of the Interior, occupy the Complex of Carondelet, which includes the buildings of the former Mail (current Benalcázar street, between Chile and Espejo) and the Government Palace, separated by the garage.
Opening to the Public.
Rafael Correa, president since 2007, considering the Carondelet Palace and its agencies an Ecuadorian cultural heritage, converted the presidential compound into a museum accessible to all who wish to visit it.
To this end, areas were organized for the placement of objects within their cultural contexts, so as to make them accessible to the public, alloting several rooms and spaces within the palace.
To carry out this work, Maria del Carmen Molestina researcher, PhD in Archeology, and former director of the Museum of the Central Bank of Ecuador, inventoried objects and identified places where the gifts that President Correa received while in office could be exhibited. Furthermore, she located objects and antique furniture from the palace with cultural value to be placed in the exhibition gallery.
Under this system, it is now possible to assign to the presidential gifts their corresponding cultural, historical and/or ethnographic value, as they are all objects that represent and embody customs, traditions, ideologies, and forms of thinking of different Ecuadorian ethnic groups.
Plunder of the Palace.
According to the researcher, Dr. María del Carmen Molestina, it is amazing how, over the years, the Carondelet Palace has been looted. Most of the furniture and items that can be seen today are new; even some of the bronze fittings from the furniture dating for the time of Garcia Moreno have been replaced by copies of gold-sprayed lead. 
The investigation, which Dr. Molestina is currently conducting, is directed at when the so-called looting began. The Carondelet Palace was restored during the presidency of Camilo Ponce Enriquez (1956-1960) and until the presidency of León Febres Cordero (1984-1988), all was as it should have been. From that period there is no information about the fate of much of the belongings of the Presidential Palace. 
Additionally, Molestina believes that everything was kept until the presidency of Rodrigo Borja (1988-1992) after which Sixto Durán Ballen (1992-1996) ordered a new presidential suite on the third floor of the palace.
