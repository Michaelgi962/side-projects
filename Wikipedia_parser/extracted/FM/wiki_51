Burundi

Burundi , officially the Republic of Burundi (, ; , ), is a landlocked country in the African Great Lakes region of Southeast Africa, bordered by Rwanda to the north, Tanzania to the east and south and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. It is also sometimes considered part of Central Africa. Burundi's capital is Bujumbura. Although the country is landlocked, much of the southwestern border is adjacent to Lake Tanganyika.
The Twa, Hutu and Tutsi peoples have lived in Burundi for at least five hundred years and, for over two hundred years, Burundi was ruled as a kingdom. At the beginning of the twentieth century, however, Germany and Belgium occupied the region and Burundi and Rwanda became a European colony known as Ruanda-Urundi. Social differences between the Tutsi and Hutu have since contributed to political unrest in the region, leading to civil war in the middle of the twentieth century. Presently, Burundi is governed as a presidential representative democratic republic.
Burundi is one of the five poorest countries in the world. It has one of the lowest per capita GDPs of any nation in the world. The country has suffered from warfare, corruption and poor access to education. Burundi is densely populated and experiences substantial emigration. According to a 2012 "DHL Global Connectedness Index", Burundi is the least globalized of 140 surveyed countries.
According to the Global Hunger Index of 2013, Burundi has an indicator ratio of 38.8 earning the nation the distinction of being the hungriest country in the world in terms of percentage. 
History.
Kingdom of Burundi.
The last Burundian monarchy is said to have begun in the late 17th century.
Colonization.
After its defeat in World War I, Germany handed control of a section of the former German East Africa to Belgium. On October 20, 1924, this land, which consisted of modern-day Rwanda and Burundi, became a Belgian League of Nations mandate territory, in practical terms part of the Belgian colonial empire, known as Ruanda-Urundi. However, the Belgians allowed Ruanda-Urundi to continue its kingship dynasty.
Following World War II, Ruanda-Urundi was a United Nations Trust Territory under Belgian administrative authority. During the 1940s, a series of policies caused divisions throughout the country. On October 4, 1943, powers were split in the legislative division of Burundi's government between chiefdoms and lower chiefdoms. Chiefdoms were in charge of land, and lower sub-chiefdoms were established. Native authorities also had powers. In 1948, Belgium allowed the region to form political parties. These factions would be one of the main influences for Burundi's independence from Belgium.
Independence and civil war.
On January 20, 1959, Burundi's ruler Mwami Mwambutsa IV requested from the Belgian Minister of Colonies a separation of Burundi and Rwanda and a dissolution of Ruanda-Urundi. Six months later, political parties were formed to bring attention to Burundi's independence from Europe and to separate Rwanda from Burundi. The first of these political parties was the Union for National Progress (UPRONA).
Burundi's push for independence was influenced to some extent by the instability and ethnic persecution that occurred in Rwanda. In November 1959, Rwandese Hutu attacked the Tutsi and massacred them by the thousands. Many Tutsi escaped to Uganda and Burundi to find freedom from persecution. The Hutu took power in Rwanda by winning Belgian-run elections in 1960.
The UPRONA, a multi-ethnic unity party led by Prince Louis Rwagasore and the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) became the most prominent organizations throughout Burundi-Urundi. After UPRONA's victory in legislative elections, Prince Rwagasore was assassinated on October 13 in 1961.
The country claimed independence on July 1, 1962, and legally changed its name from Ruanda-Urundi to Burundi. Mwami Mwambutsa IV was named king. On September 18, 1962, just over two months after declaring independence from Belgium, Burundi joined the United Nations.
Upon Burundi’s independence, a constitutional monarchy was established and both Hutus and Tutsis were represented in parliament. When King Mwambutsa appointed a Tutsi prime minister, the Hutus, who were the majority in parliament, felt cheated. An ensuing attempted coup by the Hutu-dominated police was ruthlessly suppressed by the Army, then led by a Tutsi officer, Captain Michel Micombero. When the next Hutu Prime Minister, Pierre Ngendandumwe, was assassinated in 1965, Hutus engaged in a series of attacks on Tutsi, which the government repressed ruthlessly, fearing the killings of Tutsis by Hutus, who wanted to follow the "Model Rwanda". The Burundi police and military were now brought under the control of the Tutsi.
Mwambutsa was deposed in 1966 by his son, Prince Ntare V, who claimed the throne. That same year, Tutsi Prime Minister Captain Michel Micombero deposed Ntare, abolished the monarchy, and declared the nation a republic, though it was in effect a military regime.
In 1972, an all Hutu organization known as Umugambwe w'Abakozi b'Uburundi or Burundi Workers' Party (UBU) organized and carried out systematic attacks on ethnic Tutsi with the declared intent of annihilating the whole group. The military regime responded with large-scale reprisals targeting Hutus. The total number of casualties was never established, but estimates for the Tutsi genocide and the reprisals on the Hutus together are said to exceed 100,000 at the very least, with a similar number of asylum-seekers in Tanzania and Rwanda. In 1976, another Tutsi, Colonel Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, led a bloodless coup and promoted various reforms. A new constitution was promulgated in 1981, keeping Burundi a one-party state. In August 1984, Bagaza was elected head of state. During his tenure, Bagaza suppressed political opponents and religious freedoms.
Major Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, overthrew Bagaza in 1987 and suspended the constitution, dissolved the political parties, and reinstated military rule under the Military Committee for National Salvation (CSMN). Anti-Tutsi ethnic propaganda disseminated by the remnants of the 1972 UBU, which had re-organized as PALIPEHUTU in 1981, led to killings of Tutsi peasants in the northern communes of Ntega and Marangara in August 1988. The death toll was put at 5,000 by the government, though some international NGOs believe this understates the losses.
The new regime did not unleash harsh reprisals (as in 1972), but the trust it gained was soon eroded when it decreed an amnesty for those who had called for, carried out, and taken credit for the killings on ethnic grounds, which amounts to genocide in international law. Many analysts consider this period as the beginning of the "culture of impunity." But other analysts consider the "culture of impunity" to have started from 1965 and 1972, when the revolt of a small and identifiable number of Hutus unleashed massive killings of Tutsis on the whole territory.
In the aftermath of the killings, a group of Hutu intellectuals wrote an open letter to Pierre Buyoya, asking for more representation of the Hutus in the administration. The signatories were sent to gaol. Nevertheless, only a few weeks later, Buyoya appointed a new government with an equal number of Hutu and Tutsi, and a Hutu, Adrien Sibomana, as Prime Minister. Buyoya also created a commission in charge of addressing the issue of national unity. In 1992, a new constitution that provided for multi-party system was promulgated, and a civil war sprang up from Burundi's core.
An estimated 250,000 people died between 1962 and 1993. Since Burundi's independence in 1962, there have been two events called genocides in the country. The 1972 mass killings of Hutus by the Tutsi-dominated army, and the 1993 mass killings of Tutsis by the Hutu populace are both described as genocide in the final report of the International Commission of Inquiry for Burundi presented to the United Nations Security Council in 2002.
First attempt at democracy.
In June 1993, Melchior Ndadaye, leader of the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), won the first democratic election and became the first Hutu head of state, leading a pro-Hutu government. However, in October 1993, Tutsi soldiers assassinated Ndadaye, which started further years of violence between Hutus and Tutsis. It is estimated that some 300,000 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the years following the assassination.
In early 1994, the parliament elected Cyprien Ntaryamira, also a Hutu, to the office of president. He and the president of Rwanda both died together when their airplane was shot down. More refugees started fleeing to Rwanda. Another Hutu, parliament speaker Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was appointed as president in October 1994. A coalition government involving 12 of the 13 parties was formed. The feared general massacre was averted, but the new government did not forbid a new phase of ethnic violences. A number of Hutu refugees in the capital, Bujumbura, were killed, and the mainly Tutsi Union for National Progress withdrew from the government and parliament.
In 1996, Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi, took power through a coup d’état. He suspended the constitution and was sworn in as president in 1998. In response to the rebel attacks, the population was forced by the government to relocate to refugee camps. Under his rule, long peace talks started, mediated by South Africa. Both parties signed agreements in Arusha, Tanzania and Pretoria, South Africa, to share power in Burundi. The agreements took four years to plan, and on August 28, 2000, a transitional government for Burundi was planned as a part of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The transitional government was placed on a trial basis for five years. After several aborted cease-fires, a 2001 peace plan and power sharing agreement has been relatively successful. A cease-fire was signed in 2003 between the Tutsi-controlled Burundian government and the largest Hutu rebel group, CNDD-FDD (National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy).
In 2003, FRODEBU Hutu leader Domitien Ndayizeye was elected president. In early 2005, ethnic quotas were formed for determining positions in Burundi's government. Throughout the year, elections for parliament and president occurred and Pierre Nkurunziza, once a leader of a Hutu rebel group, was elected president. As of 2008, the Burundian government is talking with the Hutu-led Palipehutu-National Liberation Forces (NLF) to bring peace to the country.
Peace agreements.
African leaders began a series of peace talks between the warring factions following a request by the United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere in 1995; following his death, South African President Nelson Mandela took the helm. As the talks progressed, South African President Thabo Mbeki and United States President Bill Clinton also lent their respective weight.
The peace talks took the form of Track I mediations. This method of negotiation can be defined as a form of diplomacy involving governmental or intergovernmental representatives, who may use their positive reputations, mediation or the “carrot and stick” method as a means of obtaining or forcing an outcome, frequently along the lines of “bargaining” or “win-lose”.
The main objective framing the talks was a structural transformation of the Burundian government and military as a way to bridge the ethnic gap between the Tutsis and Hutus. This would be accomplished in two ways. First, a transitional power sharing government would be established, with the presidents holding office for three-year terms. The second objective involved a restructuring of the military, where the two groups would be represented equally.
As the protracted nature of the peace talks demonstrated, there were several obstacles facing the mediators and negotiating parties. First, the Burundian officials perceived the goals as “unrealistic” and viewed the treaty as ambiguous, contradictory and confusing. Second, and perhaps most importantly, the Burundians believed the treaty would be irrelevant without an accompanying cease fire. This would require separate and direct talks with the rebel groups. The main Hutu party was skeptical of the offer of a power-sharing government; they alleged that they were deceived by the Tutsis in past agreements.
In 2000, the Burundian President signed the treaty, as well as 13 of the 19 warring Hutu and Tutsi factions. However, disagreements persisted over which group would preside over the nascent government and when the ceasefire would commence. The spoilers of the peace talks were the hardliner Tutsi and Hutu groups who refused to sign the accord; as a result, violence intensified. Three years later at a summit of African leaders in Tanzania, the Burundian president and the main opposition Hutu group signed an accord to end the conflict; the signatory members were granted ministerial posts within the government. However, smaller militant Hutu groups – such as the Forces for National Liberation – remained active.
UN involvement.
Between 1993 and 2003, many rounds of peace talks, overseen by regional leaders in Tanzania, South Africa, and Uganda, gradually established power-sharing agreements to satisfy the majority of the contending groups. Initially the South African Protection Support Detachment was deployed to protect Burundian leaders returning from exile, which then became part of the African Union Mission to Burundi, deployed to help oversee the installation of a transitional government. In June 2004, the UN stepped in and took over peacekeeping responsibilities as a signal of growing international support for the already markedly advanced peace process in Burundi.
The mission’s mandate, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, has been to monitor cease-fire; carry out disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants; support humanitarian assistance and refugee and IDP return; assist with elections; protect international staff and Burundian civilians; monitor Burundi’s troublesome borders including halting illicit arms flows; and assist in carrying out institutional reforms including those of the Constitution, judiciary, armed forces, and police. The mission has been allotted 5,650 military personnel, 120 civilian police, and about 1,000 international and local civilian personnel. The mission has been functioning well and has greatly benefited from the existence of a fairly functional transitional government, which is in the process of transitioning into a more legitimate, elected entity.
The main difficulty the operation faced at first was the continued resistance to the peace process by the last Hutu nationalist rebel group. This organization continued its violent conflict on the outskirts of the capital despite the UN’s presence. By June 2005, the group had stopped fighting and was brought back into the political process. All political parties have accepted a formula for inter-ethnic power-sharing, which means no political party can gain access to government offices unless it is ethnically integrated.
The focus of the UN’s mission had been to enshrine the power-sharing arrangements in a popularly voted constitution, so that elections may be held and a new government installed. Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration were done in tandem with elections preparations. In February 2005, the Constitution was approved with over 90% of the popular vote. In May, June, and August 2005, three separate elections were also held at the local level for the Parliament and the presidency.
While there are still some difficulties with refugee returns and securing adequate food supplies for the war-weary population, the mission has managed to win the trust and confidence of a majority of the formerly warring leaders as well as the population at large. It has also been involved with several “quick impact” projects including rehabilitating and building schools, orphanages, health clinics, and rebuilding infrastructure such as water lines.
2006 to present.
Reconstruction efforts in Burundi started to practically take effect after 2006. The UN shut down its peacekeeping mission and re-focused on helping with reconstruction. Toward achieving economic reconstruction, Rwanda, D.R.Congo and Burundi relaunched the regional Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries. In addition, Burundi, along with Rwanda, joined the East African Community in 2007.
However, the terms of the September 2006 Ceasefire between the government and the last remaining armed opposition group, the FLN (Forces for National Liberation, also called NLF or FROLINA), were not totally implemented, and senior FLN members subsequently left the truce monitoring team, claiming that their security was threatened. In September 2007, rival FLN factions clashed in the capital, killing 20 fighters and causing residents to begin fleeing. Rebel raids were reported in other parts of the country. The rebel factions disagreed with the government over disarmament and the release of political prisoners. In late 2007 and early 2008, FLN combatants attacked government-protected camps where former combatants were living. The homes of rural residents were also pillaged.
The 2007 report of Amnesty International mentions many areas where improvement is required. Civilians are victims of repeated acts of violence done by the FLN. The latter also recruits child soldiers. The rate of violence against women is high. Perpetrators regularly escape prosecution and punishment by the state. There is an urgent need for reform of the judicial system. Genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity remain unpunished. The establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and a Special Tribunal for investigation and prosecution has not yet been implemented. The freedom of expression is limited; journalists are frequently arrested for carrying out legitimate professional activities. A total of 38,087 Burundian refugees have been repatriated between January and November 2007.
In late March 2008, the FLN sought for the parliament to adopt a law guaranteeing them ‘provisional immunity’ from arrest. This would cover ordinary crimes, but not grave violations of international humanitarian law like war crimes or crimes against humanity . Even though the government has granted this in the past to people, the FLN has been unable to obtain the provisional immunity.
On April 17, 2008, the FLN bombarded Bujumbura. The Burundian army fought back and the FLN suffered heavy losses. A new ceasefire was signed on May 26, 2008. In August 2008, President Nkurunziza met with the FLN leader Agathon Rwasa, with the mediation of Charles Nqakula, South Africa’s Minister for Safety and Security. This was the first direct meeting since June 2007. Both agree to meet twice a week to establish a commission to resolve any disputes that might arise during the peace negotiations.
Refugee camps are now closing down, and 450,000 refugees have returned. The economy of the country is shattered – as of 2011 Burundi has one of the lowest per capita gross incomes in the world. With the return of refugees, amongst others, property conflicts have started.
Burundi now participates in African Union peacekeeping missions, including the mission to Somalia against Al-Shahab militants.
Politics.
Burundi's political system is that of a presidential representative democratic republic based upon a multi-party state. The President of Burundi is the head of state and head of government. There are currently 21 registered parties in Burundi. On March 13, 1992, Tutsi coup leader Pierre Buyoya established a constitution, which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition. Six years later, on June 6, 1998, the constitution was changed, broadening National Assembly's seats and making provisions for two vice presidents. Because of the Arusha Accord, Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000.
Burundi's legislative branch is a bicameral assembly, consisting of the Transitional National Assembly and the Transitional Senate. As of 2004, the Transitional National Assembly consists of 170 members, with the Front for Democracy in Burundi holding 38% of seats, and 10% of the assembly is controlled by UPRONA. Fifty-two seats are controlled by other parties. Burundi's constitution mandates representation in the Transitional National Assembly to be consistent with 60% Hutu, 40% Tutsi, and 30% female members, as well as three Batwa members. Members of the National Assembly are elected by popular vote and serve for five-year terms.
The Transitional Senate has fifty-one members, and three seats are reserved for former presidents. Due to stipulations in Burundi's constitution, 30% of Senate members must be female. Members of the Senate are elected by electoral colleges, which consist of members from each of Burundi's provinces and communes. For each of Burundi's seventeen provinces, one Hutu and one Tutsi senator are chosen. One term for the Transitional Senate is five years.
Together, Burundi's legislative branch elect the President to a five-year term. Burundi's president appoints officials to his Council of Ministers, which is also part of the executive branch. The president can also pick fourteen members of the Transitional Senate to serve on the Council of Ministers. Members of the Council of Ministers must be approved by two-thirds of Burundi's legislature. The president also chooses two vice-presidents. As of 2010, the President of Burundi is Pierre Nkurunziza. The First Vice President is Therence Sinunguruza, and the Second Vice President is Gervais Rufyikiri.
The "Court Supreme" (Supreme Court) is Burundi's highest court. There are three Courts of Appeals directly below the Supreme Court. Tribunals of First Instance are used as judicial courts in each of Burundi's provinces as well as 123 local tribunals.
Provinces, Communes and Collines.
Burundi is divided into 17 provinces, 117 communes, and 2,638 collines (hills). Provincial governments are structured upon these boundaries. In 2000, the province encompassing Bujumbura was separated into two provinces, Bujumbura Rural and Bunjumbura Mairie.
The provinces are:
Geography.
One of the smallest countries in Africa, Burundi is landlocked and has an equatorial climate. Burundi is a part of the Albertine Rift, the western extension of the East African Rift. The country lies on a rolling plateau in the center of Africa. The average elevation of the central plateau is , with lower elevations at the borders. The highest peak, Mount Heha at , lies to the southeast of the capital, Bujumbura. The source of the Nile River is in Bururi province, and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the Ruvyironza River Lake Victoria is also an important water source, which serves as a fork to the Kagera River. Another major lake is Lake Tanganyika, located in much of Burundi's southwestern corner.
Burundi's lands are mostly agricultural or pasture. Settlement by rural populations has led to deforestation, soil erosion and habitat loss. Deforestation of the entire country is almost completely due to overpopulation, with a mere remaining and an ongoing loss of about 9% per annum. There are two national parks, Kibira National Park to the northwest (a small region of rain forest, adjacent to Nyungwe Forest National Park in Rwanda), Ruvubu National Park to the northeast (along the Rurubu River, also known as Ruvubu or Ruvuvu). Both were established in 1982 to conserve wildlife populations.
Economy.
Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries, owing in part to its landlocked geography, poor legal system, lack of economic freedom, lack of access to education, and the proliferation of HIV/AIDS. Approximately 80% of Burundi's population lives in poverty. Famines and food shortages have occurred throughout Burundi, most notably in the 20th century, and according to the World Food Programme, 56.8% of children under age five suffer from chronic malnutrition. One scientific study of 178 nations rated Burundi's population as having the lowest satisfaction with life in the world. As a result of poverty, Burundi is dependent on foreign aid.
Burundi's largest industry is agriculture, which accounted for just over 30% of the GDP. Subsistence agriculture accounts for 90% of agriculture. The nation's largest source of revenue is coffee, which makes up 93% of Burundi's exports. Other agricultural products include cotton, tea, maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes, bananas, manioc (tapioca); beef, milk, and hides. Some of Burundi's natural resources include uranium, nickel, cobalt, copper, and platinum. Besides agriculture, other industries include: assembly of imported components; public works construction; food processing, and light consumer goods such as blankets, shoes, and soap. Burundi's currency is the Burundian franc (BIF); as of May 26, 2012, 1,371.00 Burundian franc were equivalent to one United States dollar.
In regards to telecommunications infrastructure, Burundi is ranked 2nd to last in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country’s information and communication technologies. Burundi ranked number 147 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 144 in 2013.
Lack of access to financial services is a serious problem for the majority of the population, particularly in the densely populated rural areas: only 2% of the total population holds bank accounts, and fewer than 0.5% use bank lending services. Microfinance, however, plays a larger role, with 4% of Burundians being members of microfinance institutions – a larger share of the population than that reached by banking and postal services combined. 26 licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) offer savings, deposits, and short- to medium-term credit. Dependence of the sector on donor assistance is limited.
Burundi is part of the East African Community and a potential member of the planned East African Federation.
Demographics.
As of July 2012, Burundi is projected to have an estimated population of 10,557,259 people. This estimate explicitly takes into account the effects of AIDS, which has a significant effect on the demographics of the country. Over 500,000 have been displaced due to the disease.
Many Burundians have migrated to other countries as a result of the civil war. In 2006, the United States accepted approximately 10,000 Burundian refugees.
Burundi remains an overwhelmingly rural society, with just 13% of the population living in urban areas in 2013. The population density of around 315 people per square kilometer (753 per sq mi) is the second highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Roughly 85% of the population are of Hutu ethnic origin, 15% are Tutsi, and fewer than 1% are indigenous Twa/Pygmies. Burundi has the fifth highest total fertility rate in the world, at 6.08 children born/woman (2012 estimates).
Religion.
Sources estimate the Christian population at 80–90%, with Roman Catholics representing the largest group at 60–65%. Protestant and Anglican practitioners constitute the remaining 15–25%. An estimated 5% of the population adheres to traditional indigenous religious beliefs. Muslims constitute 2–5%, the majority of whom are Sunnis and live in urban areas.
Health.
Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly agricultural; agriculture accounts for just over 30% of GDP and employs more than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Burundi's export earnings – and its ability to pay for imports – rests primarily on weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania, and displaced 140,000 others internally. Only one in two children go to school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food, medicine, and electricity remain in short supply. Less than 2% of the population has electricity in its homes. Burundi's GDP grew around 4% annually in 2006–12. Political stability and the end of the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has increased, but underlying weaknesses – a high poverty rate, poor education rates, a weak legal system, a poor transportation network, overburdened utilities, and low administrative capacity – risk undermining planned economic reforms. The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept up with inflation. Burundi will remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors – foreign aid represents 42% of Burundis national income, the second highest rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Burundi joined the East African Community in 2009, which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and also in 2009 received $700 million in debt relief. Government corruption is hindering the development of a healthy private sector as companies seek to navigate an environment with ever changing rules.
Culture.
Burundi's culture is based on local tradition and the influence of neighboring countries, though cultural prominence has been hindered by civil unrest. Since farming is the main industry, a typical Burundian meal consists of sweet potatoes, corn, and peas. Due to the expense, meat is eaten only a few times per month. When several Burundians of close acquaintance meet for a gathering they drink impeke, a beer, together from a large container to symbolize unity. Notable Burundians include the soccer player Mohammed Tchité and singer Jean Pierre Nimbona, popularly known as Kidumu (who is based in Nairobi, Kenya).
Crafts are an important art form in Burundi and are attractive gifts to many tourists. Basket weaving is a popular craft for Burundian artisans. Other crafts such as masks, shields, statues and pottery are made in Burundi.
Drumming is an important part of the Burundian cultural heritage. The world-famous Royal Drummers of Burundi, who have performed for over forty years, are noted for traditional drumming using the karyenda, amashako, ibishikiso, and ikiranya drums. Dance often accompanies drumming performance, which is frequently seen in celebrations and family gatherings. The abatimbo, which is performed at official ceremonies and rituals, and the fast-paced abanyagasimbo are some famous Burundian dances. Some musical instruments of note are the flute, zither, ikembe, indonongo, umuduri, inanga, and the inyagara.
Kirundi, French, and Swahili are spoken throughout Burundi. Burundi's oral tradition is strong, relaying history and life lessons through storytelling, poetry, and song. Imigani, indirimbo, amazina, and ivyivugo are types of literary genres existing in Burundi.
Basketball and track and field are noted sports in Burundi. Martial arts are popular, as well. There are five major judo clubs: Club Judo de l'Entente Sportive, in Downtown, and four others throughout the city. Football (soccer) is a popular pastime throughout the country, as are mancala games.
Most Christian holidays are celebrated in Burundi, with Christmas being the largest. Burundian Independence Day is celebrated annually on July 1. In 2005, the Burundian government declared Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic holiday, to be a public holiday.
In April 2009, the government of Burundi changed the law to criminalise homosexuality. Persons found guilty of consensual same-sex relations risk two to three years in prison and a fine of 50,000 to 100,000 Burundian francs. Amnesty International has condemned the action, calling it a violation of Burundi’s obligations under international and regional human rights law, and against the constitution, which guarantees the right to privacy.
Education.
In 2009, the adult literacy rate in Burundi was estimated to be 67% (73% male and 61% female), with a literacy rate of 77% and 76%, respectively, for men and women between the ages of 15 to 24. Literacy among adult women in Burundi has increased by 17% since 2002. Burundi's literacy rate is low due to low school attendance and because literacy in Kirundi only provides access to materials printed in that language. Ten percent of Burundian boys are allowed a secondary education.
Burundi has the University of Burundi. There are several museums in the cities, such as the Burundi Geological Museum in Bujumbura and the Burundi National Museum and the Burundi Museum of Life in Gitega.
There will also be a new school opening in one of the poorest regions of Burundi, Rusaga, which is funded by an English charity called the 'Burundi Education Foundation'. The Burundi Education Foundation is hoping to open the school in the summer of 2014. 
In 2010 a new elementary school was opened in the small village of Rwoga, Burundi which is funded the students of Westwood High School, Quebec, Canada.

Orehovica, Vipava

Orehovica () is a small settlement south of Podnanos in the upper Vipava Valley in the Municipality of Vipava in the Littoral region of Slovenia.
Geography.
Orehovica is a compact village in the valley of Dog Tail Creek (), which starts at Vrhi below Lakovec Hill (591 m). Kunovec Creek, a left tributary, joins it in the settlement. The flat areas of the settlement are covered by meadows and fields, and vineyards cover the southern slope of the ridge above the valley. The forest in the settlement extends to Mount Nanos.
Name.
The name "Orehovica" and names like it (e.g., "Orehovec", "Orehovci", "Orehovlje", "Orešje") are relatively common in Slovenia. It is derived from the common noun "oreh" 'walnut', thus referring to the local vegetation.
Church.
A chapel of ease dedicated to the Trinity stands above the settlement. The church was consecrated in 1642. It contains a carved altar dating to the 18th century. The church was almost entirely rebuilt in 1987–1988, and was reconsecrated on 28 August 1988.

Serdar Aziz

Serdar Aziz (born 23 October 1990) is a Turkish footballer who plays as a center back for Bursaspor in the Süper Lig.
Early years.
Aziz was born in Osmangazi, Bursa Province. His father was born in Bitola, Macedonia, but of Turkish origin. His mother was also born in Bursa. He has two older siblings, one brother and one sister. Aziz's father was an amateur footballer in Bursa.
At the age of 10, Aziz enrolled in a football school in Bursa. He spent 2 months at the school before he was signed to a youth contract by Bursaspor. Aziz was originally played in midfield due to his small stature. However, Aziz pleaded his coach to play him as a center back because he believed he wasn't good enough technically to play in midfield. Aziz had a growth spurt soon after, which cemented his position at stopper.
Career.
Raşit Çetiner called Aziz up to the senior squad in 2006. Although he didn't make his debut, Aziz was allowed to train alongside the senior players. He was loaned to feeder club Bursa Merinosspor for the 2007–08 season. Aziz wasn't open to the move, but warmed up to the idea after he realized the club was virtually one and the same with Bursaspor. He admitted the physical nature of the TFF Third League helped aid his development into becoming a professional center back. Aziz made his professional debut for Bursaspor on 25 October 2008 against Fenerbahçe, with Bursaspor losing 2–5. He was a part of the Bursaspor squad that won the Süper Lig in 2009–10.

Hellmut Ludwig Späth

Hellmut Ludwig Späth (1885-1945), the son of Franz and Wilhelmine Späth, became the sixth and last manager of the Späth nursery on the death of his father in 1913. After studies at Cambridge, Hellmut returned to Berlin in 1910 and received his doctorate in 1912 from the Berlin Agricultural College. His dissertation was titled "The locust drive - a contribution to the knowledge of periodicity and annual ring formation in deciduous woody plants", and was published by Paul Parey. 
Hellmut revived the nursery's fortunes during the Depression by joining the Nazi Party and obtaining lucrative landscaping contracts for the new autobahns and other public works. However, his outspoken criticism of the Nazi regime saw him incarcerated in Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was executed by firing squad in 1945. The nursery had closed in 1944, and in 1947 the arboretum passed into public ownership and became known as the Späthsches Arboretum.
In 2009, a Stolperstein (small, cobble stone-sized memorial plaque) was installed at his old school, Landesschule Pforta, to commemorate Späth as a victim of the Nazi regime.

<doc id="21491106" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21491106" title="Walter Montagu">
Walter Montagu

Walter Montagu (c. 1603–1677) was an English courtier, secret agent (a.k.a. David Cutler) and Benedictine abbot.
Life.
He was the second son of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester, by his first wife Catherine Spencer. He was born in the parish of St. Botolph Without, Aldersgate, London, and educated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.
He then spent some time abroad. In 1624 he was engaged by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, to take part in the diplomacy leading to the French marriage of the future Charles I of England to Henrietta Maria; and for subsequent diplomacy. He graduated M.A. at Cambridge in 1627. He was present at Portsmouth in 1628 when Buckingham was assassinated. 
He continued to work in France, funded as a secret service agent, returning to England in 1633. At court he distinguished himself by his pastoral drama, entitled "The Shepherd's Paradise", which he had published in 1629. The work was heavily influenced by a French novel "Astrée", by Honoré d'Urfé, dedicated to Henry IV of France, the Queen's father; the Queen herself acted in it, when it was performed in 1633, and it set a trend for theatricals among the courtiers. Sir John Suckling ridiculed it in his poem "The Session of the Poets" (1637).
He went again to the Continent, as "attaché" to the Paris embassy, and also travelled. The Queen gave him a letter of introduction to the Papal Court, and Pope Urban VIII received him. Back in Paris, and went to see the exorcisms at Loudun. He became a Catholic convert under Jean-Joseph Surin, who was in charge of the exorcisms in the Loudun possessions.
Returning to England, he received a post in the Queen's household. But the news of his conversion having reached the ears of the King, his Majesty privately asked him to absent himself for a time from Court. Montagu visited Paris again in 1635, and announced his departure for Rome to become an Oratorian. He arrived at Rome in February 1636, with a private commission for King Charles. He asked Cardinal Barberini, to make George Conn a Cardinal; but was unable to accomplish this. It was arranged, however, that Conn should replace Gregorio Panzani as envoy to the English Court.
In 1639, at the time of the First Bishops' War, the Queen solicited monetary help from Catholics. In response a meeting of Catholics was held in London, and the contribution being recommended, the collection was entrusted to Montagu and Sir Kenelm Digby. The matter came before Parliament, which expressed its displeasure, 
and the Queen excused her action in a letter. All this made Montagu a marked man, so that when the First English Civil War broke out he left for France.
He entered a Benedictine monastery, and was professed in the order. In due course he was ordained priest, became a naturalised subject of France, and was in favour with the Queen-Regent, Marie de Medicis, at whose Court he appears to have resided. Through her influence he was made abbot of the Benedictine monastery at Nanteuil, in the diocese of Metz, and subsequently the commendatory abbacy of St. Martin, near Pontoise, was conferred upon him. The Queen-Regent also appointed him a member of her Cabinet Council, and in this capacity he was the chief instrument of introducing Cardinal Mazarin to Henrietta Maria.
It is said that in 1643 Montagu came over to England with letters of importance and was apprehended at Rochester, and remained in confinement there until 1647, when he was banished the kingdom by a vote of Parliament. Possibly there is some confusion with a later visit in company with Sir Kenelm Digby and Sir John Winter. It would certainly appear that Montagu was some time imprisoned in the Tower of London, for in 1645 the Puritan minister, John Bastwick, published his version of the disputation he there held with him, and the Parliament's order of banishment is dated 1649.
Meanwhile, Queen Henrietta Maria had taken up residence at the Louvre, and had lost her chaplain, Fr. Robert Phillip, an Oratorian and a Scot, who died on 4 January 1647. The abbot was chosen his successor, and was also appointed her Majesty's Lord Almoner. Subsequently he resided with her at the Palais Royal, with intervals of retirement to his abbey. Sir Edward Nicholas reported to Edward Hyde in 1552 to Edward Hyde that Montagu and other Catholics were the cause of the exclusion from the exile court of Thomas Hobbes, a suspected atheist. After the Restoration, and Somerset House had been prepared for her Majesty's reception in 1663, the abbot was summoned to reside with her there, and apparently returned to France with her in June 1665. At this period Edward Walsingham was acting as his secretary, and accompanied him to England. The Queen died on 31 August 1669 and the abbot officiated at her funeral. He then appears to have been appointed Grand Almoner to her daughter, the Duchess of Orleans, but she also died in the following year.
In 1670 he received an order from Court to remove from his abbey, and surrender his apartments to the young Cardinal Bouillon, who was designated to be his successor, and forthwith assumed the title of Abbot of St. Martin's. Montagu was paid the usual revenue during life. He retired to Paris, and took up his residence in the hospital 
called the Incurables, where he died on 5 February 1677.
Works.
Walter W. Greg, "Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama", gives this plot summary. "The King of Castile negotiates a marriage between his son and the princess of Navarre. The former, however, is in love with a lady of the court named Fidamira, who repulses his advances in favour of Agenor, a friend of the prince's. The prince therefore resolves to leave the court and seek the Shepherds' Paradise, a sequestered vale inhabited by a select and courtly company, and induces Agenor to accompany him on his expedition. In their absence the king himself makes love to Fidamira, who, however, escapes, and likewise makes her way to the Shepherds' Paradise in disguise. Meanwhile, Belesa, the princess of Navarre, misliking of the proposed match with a man she has never seen, has withdrawn from her father's court to the same pastoral retreat, where she has at once been elected queen of the courtly company. On the arrival of the prince and his friend they both fall in love with her, but the prince's suit is seconded by the disguised Fidamira, and soon takes a favourable turn. At this point the King of Castile arrives in pursuit, together with an old councillor, who proceeds to reveal the relationship of the various characters. Fidamira and Belesa, it appears, are sisters, and Agenor their brother. The marriage of the prince and Belesa is of course solemnized; the king renews his suit to Fidamira, but she prefers to remain in Paradise, where she is chosen perpetual queen."

Hit-and-run incident (2010).
When a driver hit and killed one young woman, wounded another, and declared “Sue me if you dare. My father is Li Gang!” before trying to flee the scene, he set off a series of repercussions. First, the authorities tried to censor Internet and newspaper coverage. "But it was so widely discussed on the Internet that propaganda officials allowed some official press coverage." The driver's challenge to bystanders and police "quickly became a cynical catchphrase to describe various forms of corruption in China and a symbol of the growing divide between the privileged and connected elite and the underprivileged in this country." The driver was said to have been drunk and "racing." He ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years in prison and some US$100,000 equivalent in compensation was paid to the family of the deceased victim and to the wounded student. The court, after the one-day closed trial in early 2011, said it was a "lenient" sentence due to a confession and the compensation. And "a lawyer who at one time represented the family of deceased ... called the verdict flawed. 'Of course it’s not fair... The whole legal process of this case has broken the rules many times.'" Li Gang "is the deputy public security chief in the district where the school is located, according to China’s state-run news media." The victims had been in-line skating on the HU campus when struck. As to the news coverage, "gadfly blog, sarcastically titled Ministry of Truth, [began to puncture the veil surrounding censorship, anonymously posting secret government directives leaked by free-speech sympathizers. According to the blog’s sources, the Central Propaganda Department issued a directive on Oct. 28, 10 days after the accident, 'ensuring there is no more hype regarding the disturbance over traffic at Hebei University.'" Meanwhile, "China’s national television network, CCTV, broadcast an Oct. 22 interview with Li Gang and his son, filled with effusive apologies for the accident though police regulations ostensibly bar interviews with detainees."

History.
The club formed as the result of a merger between FC Alma-Ata and FC Megasport in the beginning of 2009 as "FC Lokomotiv Astana". Later they moved to newly built Astana Arena. The club has benefited from a high salary role which has enabled them to attract players of status to the club. Andrei Tikhonov and Yegor Titov first of all came from the Russian Football Premier League. Several more followed such as Patrick Ovie and Baffour Gyan. Maxim Shatskikh later arrived from Dynamo Kiev in the Ukrainian Premier League which is again a very high profile capture for the club. The majority of their other players have arrived from other clubs of the Kazakhstan Premier League, mostly on free transfers from the clubs which were absorbed to make the club and several which last year went into bankruptcy. The club earned silver medals in their first season of play.
In 2010, Holger Fach guided Lokomotiv to their first Kazakhstan Cup success. However, they were ineligible for a UEFA license since they had not yet existed for at least three years. So they were not able to start in 2011–12 UEFA Europa League. On 2 March 2011, Lokomotiv beat Tobol 2–1 and won the Kazakhstan Super Cup for the first time. On 20 May 2011, the club was renamed to FC Astana. In 2012, Miroslav Beránek led Astana to win their second Kazakhstan Cup. In July 2013, the club played in the First qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League against Botev Plovdiv. Astana lost both matches, 0-1 at home and 0-5 away. On 4 July 2013, Astana officially joined to newly created Astana Presidential Sports Club, the organization supported by Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna to combine the main sports teams in Astana.

Saladin in Egypt

While Saladin is most famous for his wars with the Crusader States the beginning of his military career was under his uncle Shirkuh on behalf of Nur al-Din in Egypt. His time in Egypt gave him the military, administrative, and diplomatic skills that he would ultimately employ in both unifying Syria and in his wars with the crusaders.
Egypt Before Saladin.
The Fatimid State in Egypt was on the verge of total disintegration in the period before Saladin's arrival. The challenges that faced the state were extensive and touched on every aspect of life in Egypt. The condition of Fatimid Egypt can be best segmented into three areas: political, social, and economic.
Political.
Power in the original Fatimid State stemmed from the Fatimid Caliph who ruled by divine right. Over the years, however, true power had shifted into the office of the vizier. The initial post of vizier was intended to be the chief administrator of the state. As the decades passed the vizier systematically increased their power over all aspects of the state, most importantly the military. With this expansion of power the Fatimid Caliphs steadily became little more than figureheads in a government run by the viziers. Any remaining power the Caliphs may have had was shattered when the last adult Caliph died in 1149. This death initiated yet another period of instability and intrigue, culminating with the killing of many males in the Fatimid royal family in 1153. These killings sparked a revolt by the Armenian governor of middle Egypt, Tala ibn Ruzzik, who was aided by al-Fa'iz's (the extremely young Caliph) sister Sitt al-Qusur. Ruzzik quickly consolidated his rule over Egypt (preventing any intervention Nur al-Din may have been planning) and ruled effectively. Under Ruzzik, Egypt regained some measure of international influence, successfully defending itself from naval molestation, raiding opposition shipping in the Eastern Mediterranean, and engaging in negotiations with Nur al-Din concerning a unified jihad against the Crusader States. The Crusaders in the Kingdom of Jerusalem were not unaware of the delicate nature of their position and sought to establish a functional relationship with Ruzzik, culminating with a truce between the two states with Egypt paying large annual sums to Jerusalem as one of the conditions. In 1161, Ruzzik was assassinated and with him died stability in Egypt. Ruzzik's son succeeded him but was quickly overthrown by the Arab governor of upper Egypt, Shawar, in 1163. In the same year Shawar himself was almost immediately overthrown by a courtier named Dirgham. Shawar fled Egypt and sought aid from Nur al-Din in Syria. The internal chaos of 1163 spilled over onto the international arena when the new king of Jerusalem, Amalric I, undertook a punitive campaign in Egypt in response to the failure of the Egyptian to pay their annual tribute. Amalric's campaign was stopped not by the Fatimid military, but rather the flooding Nile that crippled his army while they laid siege to the town of Bilbays in northern Egypt.
Social.
The Fatimid caliph's claim to power was based on the belief, that the Fatimid caliph is the divinely appointed Imam of the descendants of Ismail ibn Jafar. The official doctrine was a branch of the Ismaili sect of Shi'ism, for further information on Fatimid doctrine, please refer to Da'a'im al-Islam ('The Pillars of Islam') written by al-Qadi al-Nu'man. This sect was viewed as heretical not only by the Sunni Caliph in Baghdad (the Abbasid Caliph) but also by many Shi'ites. Most Egyptians, however, rejected Ismailism and practiced Sunni. Tensions were further exacerbated as the Caliphs steadily lost power, including the power to support their state religion. Into this growing void stepped Sunni, which thrived in Egypt's north especially around the city of Alexandria. In addition to this mounting religious pressure the ever unstable nature of Egyptian political life forced elites in every field (administrative, poetic, legal, etc.) into tight knit social circles often susceptible to purges when rival factions seized power. This resulted in the deaths of many of Egypt's most talented people, contributing to the free fall of the Fatimid state.
Economic.
Perhaps the only part of Egypt before Saladin that can be referred to as successful was its economy. Since ancient times the fertile banks of the Nile had made Egypt the bread basket of the Eastern Mediterranean. The tombs of the Pharaohs served as man made gold mines to the Fatimids, who actively stripped the wealth of these ancient tombs to support their projects. The final lynch pin in Egypt's successful economy was the growth of trade. Trade routes extended as far as India with goods from the East funneling through upper Egypt on their way to Europe and the Middle East, contributing to the extensive growth of trade cities like Damietta and Alexandria. For once the weakness of the Fatimid state served as an advantage as people of all religious backgrounds capitalized on all aspects of the thriving trade and succeeded in creating a surprisingly successful financial system. This strong economy and financial system provided the Egyptian viziers like Ruzzik with the ability to wield amazing funds in both internal and international politics.
Campaigns in Egypt.
Nur al-Din had long sought to intervene in Egypt especially after missing his opportunity when Tala ibn Ruzzik successfully brought the country under control, blocking his ambitions for nearly a decade. Thus, Nur al-Din closely watched the events of 1163 with his reliable general Shirkuh waiting for an appropriate opportunity to bring the country under his control. Before the campaigns it would be hard to find a figure more obscure than Saladin, but by their end he would emerge as one of the most prominent figures in the Medieval Middle East.
Campaign of 1163.
In Syria, Shawar easily convinced Nur al-Din to support his cause in Egypt. Nur al-Din was motivated partially by his long standing desire to gain control over Egypt and partially by a desire to block further military adventures by Amalric. Nur al-din sent the head of his army Shirkuh (who in turn took his nephew, Saladin, with him) to accompany Shawar back to Egypt and return him to power. The force set out in May 1163 and quickly entered Cairo where they deposed Dirgham. Once Dirgham had been overthrown, however, it quickly became clear that Shawar was not going to uphold his agreement, neither paying tribute to Nur al-Din nor giving Shirkuh's troops the fiefs he had promised. Shawar then entered into negotiations with Amalric in an attempt to garner support against his former benefactor. He ultimately enticed Amalric into an alliance against Nur al-Din by making several concessions including the release of Christian prisoners and submitting to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Together Amalric and Shawar marched on the city Bilbays, which Shirkuh was using as his base. Neither of the allies wanted to storm the city so they chose to put it under siege (the native Egyptians understood the flood cycles of the Nile and thus knew they would not suffer the same fate as Amalric's previous siege of the city). Nur al-Din took advantage of the absence of Amalric and Jerusalem's army to attack the Crusader States, winning a pitched battle and retaking the city of Harim. Nur al-Din continued his advance and took the city of Baniyas, forcing Amalric to return from Egypt. A peace deal was brokered in November 1163 which required both Amalric and Shirkuh to withdraw from Egypt in exchange for large payments from Shawar. Shawar emerged as the ultimate victor having both gained personal control of Egypt and having avoided submission to either Nur al-Din or Amalric.
Campaign of 1167.
The ambitious Shirkuh was discontented with the result of the 1163 campaign and began preparing for a new invasion of Egypt. Shawar was aware of Shirkuh's intentions and entered into negotiation with Amalric to renew their alliance in the event of Shirkuh's invasion. In late 1166 and early 1167, Shirkuh, again with Saladin, attacked Egypt with Nur al-Din's support. Amalric and Shawar quickly mobilized against Shirkuh's coming force. Shirkuh managed to avoid Amalric's army in the open and travel south into Egypt and use the west bank of the Nile to stave off an attack from the combined forces of Amalric and Shawar. Finally in March 1167 the allies forced a battle which Shirkuh won, despite heavy losses to both sides. Shirkuh then proceeded to Alexandria where the largely Sunni population opened their gates to him and offered support. Amalric and Shirkuh quickly regrouped, however, and closed on Alexandria. Not willing to be trapped with his main army in Alexandria, Shirkuh left the city, leaving Saladin and a small force to defend it. The allies quickly subjected the city to a vicious siege. In his first major military position, Saladin managed to organize a continued defense of the city and maintain the support of the population, despite great suffering brought on by the long siege. Shirkuh remained largely inactive in the countryside, failing to attack either the besieging army or the garrisoned city of Cairo, which held the Fatimid Caliph. Ultimately a peace treaty was negotiated between Shirkuh and the allies with the agreement that Amalric and Shirkuh would withdraw their forces in exchange for payments and amnesty would be granted to the people of Alexandria (Shawar was only held from retribution on the city after it was made part of the peace agreement and Amalric promised protection to the city). Saladin stayed in the Crusader camp during these negotiations in which he sought to assure the terms protecting Alexandria.
Campaign of 1168.
Facing internal pressures stemming from his unpopular alliance with Amalric, Shawar tried to negotiate with Nur al-Din to keep Shirkuh from attacking Egypt for a third time. It was Shawar who found himself betrayed, however, when Amalric attacked Egypt in 1168. Amalric quickly captured the city of Bilbays in early November and massacred the population that had frustrated him twice in 1163. He then quickly marched on Fustat, the official capital of Egypt, before Shawar could gather his forces. Shawar responded by burning the city before Amalric could take it and use it as a base against Cairo (the Caliph's city and de facto capital of Egypt). Unimpressed by Shawar's actions, Amalric besieged Cairo and attempted to storm the city. With the enemy at the gates of his city, the Fatimid Caliph, al-Adid, requested aid from Nur al-Din. Nur al-Din quickly ordered Shirkuh to return to Egypt. Shirkuh again recruited Saladin who apparently took convincing following the hard times he had endured at Alexandria. Shirkuh left for Egypt in December 1168. Hearing of Shirkuh's arrival in Egypt in January 1169, Amalric quickly negotiated a truce with Shawar (including the usual payments by the Egyptians in exchange for withdrawal) and returned to Jerusalem. With the support of al-Adid, Shirkuh entered Cairo unopposed. Saladin then personally arrested Shawar and brought him to al-Adid, who ordered Shawar's execution. Shirkuh was appointed the new vizier and gave Saladin a high administrative position. Shirkuh died shortly afterwards, in March 1169, after an exceptionally large and rich meal. Saladin was then selected from Shirkuh's emirs to become the vizier (though it is unclear whether or not the emirs selected him or the Egyptians chose him in an attempt to create conflict between the Kurdish and Turkish emirs).
Saladin's Vizierate.
The ascension to the vizierate was clearly a defining moment in his life. He married for the first time. The Fatimid State he inherited was every bit as unstable as the one Shawar had seized, but Saladin faced the additional challenge of being of foreign occupier. This challenge was increased because Saladin's overlord, Nur al-Din, knew little of his diseased emir's nephew, other than that he was from the famously ambitious Ayyubid family. Thus Saladin's time as vizier can best be judged as trying to repair the political and social situation is Egypt while under constant scrutiny from Nur al-Din, who believed that the addition of Egypt's resources to his Syrian empire as one of the final steps towards completing his jihad against the Crusader States.
Political.
Saladin almost immediately faced challenges from the established pro-Fatimid military and civilian elites, who feared that the presence of a foreign Sunni vizier would result in the destruction of their dynasty. A conspiracy against Saladin by these elites formed in 1169 centered around the black eunuch who served as majordomo of the Caliph's palace. Saladin uncovered this plot and had the eunuch executed while outside of the city inspecting his properties. This execution triggered an uprising by the black units of the Fatimid military who were both numerous and extremely loyal to the Caliphate. Saladin quickly and effectively put down this revolt and began restructuring the Fatimid military around the Syrian units who had remained with him in Egypt, both increasing the effectiveness of the military and granting him greater personal control over it. This revolt was not the only challenge of 1169 as Amalric returned and, with support of the Byzantine navy, attempted to take Damietta. Unfortunately, for Saladin disunity between the attackers forced them to settle for terms and withdraw. But having established a relatively secure position by 1170, Saladin increased his power within Egypt by importing his family (most notably his father, Ayyoub) whom he appointed to important positions throughout the government. He also sought to test the Fatamid ruler Al-Adid by publicly disrespecting him through actions, such as riding his horse into the courtyard of the Caliph's palace (something only the caliph was allowed to do). Clearly feeling secure in Egypt Saladin undertook attacks against the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1170 and succeeded in taking the strategic town of Ayla. He withdrew early from the 1171 campaign, which was supposed to be an assault on the Crusader fortress of Karak with Nur al-Din Zangi, partially because he wanted to avoid meeting his master and officially due to the death of his father. Nur al-Din was displeased with these actions and viewed Saladin after Ayyoub's death (Ayyoub was greatly trusted by Nur al-Din and oversaw Egypt's finances on his behalf). In order to reign in his vassal and gain favor with the Abbasid Caliph, Nur al-Din commanded Saladin to overthrow the Fatimid Dynasty in June 1171. Unwilling to take more revolts, Saladin waited until Al-Adid's timely death (many suspected that al-Adid was in fact poisoned by Saladin, probably) to officially end the dynasty of the Fatamids, which he did on September 17, 1171 by having the Friday sermons across Egypt said in the name Al-Mustadi, the Abbasid caliph.
Social.
Though he did not disband the Fatimid Caliphate until 1171 Saladin actively sought to spread Sunnism as soon as he became the vizier. He established numerous mosques and madrasah in order further the spread of Sunni beliefs. This move was extremely popular amongst the majority Sunni population and by systematically appointing Sunni jurists to legal positions throughout the state Saladin tactfully eliminated any opposition he might encounter from the religious establishment when attempting to disband the Fatimid Caliphate. Another hallmark of Saladin's effective rule was his willingness to accept useful Egyptian elites into his administration. None of these were more important than Qadi al-Fadil, a brilliant jurist from Ascalon, who had served Shawar and briefly Shirkuh before coming into the service of Saladin. Men like Qadi al-Fadil provided Saladin with the more than just their ample skills, but also with direct connections into the complicated social/political circles that held power in the Fatimid State. Finally, Saladin's famed tolerance towards non-Muslims emerged when he allowed the Coptic Christians and Jews, who were deeply ingrained into Egypt's highly successful financial system, to retain their posts. This move secured the continued success of Egypt's thriving economy.
Ruler of Egypt.
With the Fatimid Caliphate gone, Saladin now found himself the ruler of Egypt, though still a subordinate of the distant Nur al-Din. Nur al-Din, in turn, did not find himself satisfied with Saladin for a number of reasons. The greatest of these was his displeasure with the size of Saladin's tribute payments, which he had expected to be much larger. This issue was intensified by the fact that Nur al-Din had sought to advance Shirkuh, not Saladin and, with Ayyub dead, Nur al-Din felt that he had no control over the younger ruler and became ever more convinced that Saladin would attempt to become independent. The extent to which Saladin may have intentionally underpaid Nur al-Din is unknown, but it is likely that the tombs of the Pharaohs were finally running dry after being so heavily tapped by previous viziers. Saladin continued to actively avoid any personal meeting with Nur al-Din, who may very well have removed him from power. There is little doubt that Saladin's actions looked suspicious as he continued his reforms across Egyptian society, including the elimination of many taxes in contradiction with Islamic law, and began construction of a formidable navy. However, Nur al-Din was not alone in facing ambitious underlings. As other Ayyubids amassed power in Egypt, they too wished to gain territory, wealth, and glory. Among these were his nephew Taqi al-Din Umar, who expanded Saladin's domains westward to the borders of the Almohad Empire in 1173, and his brother Turanshah, who invaded Yemen and deposed its heretical leader in 1174. These maneuvers led Nur al-Din to send an auditor to Egypt to establish the appropriate amount of payments in 1173, a clear sign of distrust. With tensions mounting, 1174 proved to be a crucial year for Saladin. Early in the year, when his ambitious brother departed for Yemen, Saladin discovered a major plot to return the Fatimids to power and dealt with the conspirators swiftly and brutally. In the meantime, Nur al-Din's patience seems to have finally worn out and he began to raise an army for the invasion of Egypt. Fortunately for Saladin, Nur al-Din became suddenly ill and died, leaving behind a number of direct successors who lacked either the age or skill to succeed him. With Egypt as his secure power base, Saladin wasted no time in marching on Damascus, where the population welcomed him with open arms in 1174. From this point forward, his attention would be focused on Syria.

Nias language

The Nias language is an Austronesian language spoken on Nias Island and the Batu Islands off the west coast of Sumatra in Indonesia. It belongs to the Northwest Sumatran subgroup which also includes Mentawai and the Batak languages. It had about 770,000 speakers in 2000. There are three main dialects: northern, central and southern.
Dialects.
The following dialects are distinguished in Ethnologue.
Phonology.
The southern dialect of Nias has the following phonemes:
The status of initial is not determined; there are no phonetic vowel-initial words in Nias. Northern Nias has but not ; in addition, is pronounced .
Grammar.
Nias has an ergative–absolutive alignment. Unusually, it appears to be the absolutive (mutated) case which is marked, against the near-universal tendency to mark the ergative.
There are no adjectives in Nias, with that function taken by verbs.
Nias shows consonant mutation at the beginning of nouns and some other classes of words to show grammatical case. Several consonants are subject to mutation as shown in the table below. Where a word begins in a vowel, either "n" or "g" is added before the vowel; the choice of "n" or "g" is lexically conditioned. (For example, "öri ~ nöri" is 'village federation', "öri ~ göri" is 'bracelet'.)
Other consonants do not change.
The unmutated form is used in citation. The mutated form only occurs on the first noun in a noun phrase (that is, not after a conjunction like 'and'). It is used for:

6-3-5 Brainwriting

6-3-5 Brainwriting (also known as the 6-3-5 Method, or Method 635) is a group creativity technique used in marketing, advertising, design, writing and product development originally developed by Professor Bernd Rohrbach in 1968.
Based on the concept of Brainstorming, the aim of 6-3-5 Brainwriting is to generate 108 new ideas in half an hour. In a similar way to brainstorming, it is not the quality of ideas that matters but the quantity.
The technique involves 6 participants who sit in a group and are supervised by a moderator. Each participant thinks up 3 ideas every 5 minutes. The ideas are written down on a worksheet and passed on to the next participant. The participant reads the ideas and uses them as inspiration for more ideas. Participants are encouraged to draw on others' ideas for inspiration, thus stimulating the creative process. After 6 rounds in 30 minutes the group has thought up a total of 108 ideas.

Théodore Botrel

Jean-Baptiste-Théodore-Marie Botrel (14 September 1868 – 28 July 1925) was a French singer-songwriter, poet and playwright. He is best known for his popular songs about his native Brittany, of which the most famous is "La Paimpolaise". During World War I he became France's official "Bard of the Armies".
Life.
Born in Dinan, Botrel was the son of a blacksmith. He was left with his grandmother in Saint-Méen-le-Grand as a child, since his parents had moved to Paris. He joined them in the capital at the age of seven. His native language was the Gallo dialect, though almost all his songs are in standard French, and he learned the Breton language later in life.
As a teenager he became involved in amateur theatricals, performing on stage in plays, and writing songs. His first published song "Le Petit Biniou" (The Little Bagpipe) was not a success.
Botrel shelved his theatrical ambitions, joining the army for five years and then working as a clerk for the Paris-Lyon-Marseille railway company. He continued to appear on stage and to write and perform songs. In 1891 he met and married Hélène Lugton, known as Léna.
La Paimpolaise.
One evening in 1895, standing in for another act, he performed his song "La Paimpolaise" (The Paimpol Girl) to great acclaim from the audience, launching himself as a popular singer. "La Paimpolaise" became his signature song - a lilting ballad about the quaint charms of the fishing village of Paimpol and its people. In fact Botrel only visited Paimpol in 1897, after he wrote the song. The song's refrain "J'aime Paimpol et sa falaise" (I love Paimpol and its cliff) was apparently chosen because 'falaise' rhymes with 'Paimpolaise'. It has often been noted that there is no cliff in the town. Nevertheless the nearby Pointe de Guiben has been marketed as the cliff described in the song. The choice of Paimpol probably derived from the popularity of Pierre Loti's recent novel "Pêcheur d'Islande", which is set in the town. The song was a central feature of the repertoire of Félix Mayol until his death in 1941. Mayol also showcased many of Botrel's later songs.
"La Paimpolaise" inspired a number of other sentimental songs which idealised Breton towns and regions. In "Jésus chez les bretons" (Jesus Among the Bretons) he implies that the second coming will be in Brittany.
Fame.
Botrel attracted the attention of Caran d'Ache and the intellectual coterie associated with the "Le Chat Noir" club, though he most often performed at the rival "Le Chien-Noir" club. With the support of Parisian intellectuals a collection of Botrel's songs was published as "Chansons de chez nous (Songs Bretonnes)" in 1898, with a preface by the Breton folklorist Anatole Le Braz. The book was highly praised and was awarded a prize by the Académie française. Edmond Rostand wrote, "les adorable chansons de Botrel font pousser des genêts quand ou les chante". François Coppée said "While I read Botrel's verses...I compare myself to a sick man dragging his walking stick along the suburb of a city and stopping now and then to listen to the young voices of the children singing. Ah, Botrel's voice is high and true and clear!."
Botrel gave up his day job to become a professional singer-songwriter. When not performing in Paris, he lived in Brittany, initially taking a house in Port-Blanc, then moving permanently to Pont-Aven. He edited the journal of popular verse "La Bonne Chanson" and in 1905 founded the "Fête des Fleurs d’Ajonc" (Gorse Flower festival) in Pont-Aven, the first of the music festivals that have since become common in Brittany. In 1909 he established a permanent monument to Breton writer Auguste Brizeux in Pont-Aven.
In addition to songwriting, Botrel tried his hand at drama, writing and performing in a number of plays, including an original Sherlock Holmes story, "Le Mystere de Kéravel", in which the detective solves a murder while travelling incognito in Brittany.
His wife Léna often sang duets with him, and regularly appeared in publicity images with him in traditional Breton costume (though in fact she was from Luxembourg). She also co-wrote some songs. Botrel's friend Émile Hamonic created number of photographic tableaux representing the scenes and stories of his songs and plays, which were widely sold and circulated as postcards with Botrel's signature. Botrel, Léna and friends including François Jaffrennou often played the roles.
Botrel also became involved in the burgeoning Pan-Celticist movement. In 1904 he and Léna attended the Pan-Celtic Congress in Caernarfon as Breton representatives.
Botrel was politically conservative, a Royalist and a devout Roman Catholic. Many of his later songs celebrated these values, and appealed to popular patriotism. The song "Le Mouchoir rouge de Cholet" (The Red Handkerchief of Cholet) is about a soldier in the Chouannerie, the Royalist Catholic rebellion against the French Revolution, who buys the handkerchief for his girl. It inspired a local manufacturer to create red Cholet handkerchiefs, the popularity of which boosted the local textile industry.
World War I and after.
Botrel was an enthusiastic supporter of the French cause in World War I. Turned down for service in the French army because of his age, he attempted to enlist with Belgian forces, but was again rejected. He decided to work for the war effort by writing and performing patriotic songs.
He had already published a collection of military songs before the war in 1912 as "Coups de Clairon". A British writer noted "It is a noble work, and one cannot think of another poet, here or in France, so abundantly equipped for its performance. Botrel has no counterpart in Britain, so it were vain to seek comparisons."
After his rejection for military service Botrel started a monthly publication entitled "Les chants du Bivouac" containing songs for the soldiers. In 1915 he was appointed as official "Chansonnier des Armées", or "Bard of the Armies". According to the New York Times he was authorised by the Minister of War "to enter all military depots, camps and hospitals for the purpose of reciting and singing his patriotic poems." He travelled throughout the front line performing to the troops. The patriotic songs were also published as poems for a children's book promoting the war effort, "Les Livres Rose pour la Jeunesse". Botrel's most famous wartime songs were "Rosalie" (the nickname of the French bayonet) and "Ma P'tite Mimi" (about a machine-gun). The latter was revived by Pierre Desproges in the 1980s.
At this time some of his lyrics were translated into English by G.E. Morrison and Edgar Preston as "Songs of Brittany".
Botrel's wife Léna died in 1916. In 1918 he remarried, to Marie-Elisabeth Schrieber, known as Mailissa. He had two daughters with her, the elder of whom, named Léna after his first wife, married the writer Emile Danoën. The younger, Janick, was the mother of the singer Renaud Detressan.
Botrel died in 1925. His incomplete autobiography, "souvenirs d'un barde errant", was published after his death. His daughter Léna later wrote extra chapters to complete the story of his life. A monument to him was erected in Paimpol designed by Pierre Lenoir. It shows the Paimpolaise gazing out to sea from the imaginary cliff. There is also a statue of him in Pont-Aven.
Songwriting.
Unable to write music, Botrel could only publish his work by singing the tune to a professional musician who would write it down. Initially he was denied credit for the melody of his most famous song when the transcriber Eugène Feautrier asserted that he was the "author" of the music. Another claimed credit as "arranger". Botrel was advised by specialists at the "Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique" that "from the moment you yourself compose the melody, even if you dictate it to a musician you remain the sole author of your chanson." From that point on he insisted on sole credit, but this produced some resentment from musicians who believed their contributions were being denied. It was also objected that songs and arrangements that were essentially in the style of modern Parisian "chanson" were being marketed as "Breton" music. Botrel and Léna also made a number of recordings.

Olivia Wilde

Olivia Jane Cockburn (; March 10, 1984), known professionally as Olivia Wilde, is an Irish American actress, screenwriter, producer, director, and model. She has appeared in a number of television and film productions. Wilde has starred in TV productions such as "The O.C.", "The Black Donnellys" and "House", and in films such as "", "Cowboys & Aliens", "In Time", "Her", and "Drinking Buddies".
Early life.
Wilde was born in New York City. Her mother, Leslie Cockburn (née Redlich), is an American-born "60 Minutes" producer and journalist. Her father, Andrew Cockburn, a journalist, was born in London to British parents but raised in Ireland; her uncles, Alexander Cockburn and Patrick Cockburn, also worked as journalists. Wilde's older sister, Chloe Cockburn, is a civil rights attorney in New York; her aunt, Sarah Caudwell, was a writer, and her paternal grandfather, Claud Cockburn, was a novelist and journalist.
Wilde's father's upper-class British ancestors lived in several places at the height of British Empire, including Peking (where her paternal grandfather was born), Calcutta, Bombay, Cairo and Tasmania (one of her paternal great-great-grandfathers, Henry Arthur Blake, was Governor of Hong Kong). Wilde's father's ancestors include abolitionist and Anglican minister James Ramsay, politician George Arbuthnot, lawyer, judge, and literary figure Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn, Lord Provost of Edinburgh Sir William Arbuthnot, and Sir Thomas Osborne. Wilde's ancestry includes English, Irish, Scottish, Manx, and German; she is also of 1/64th Sephardi Jewish descent (from Spain and Portugal) through Ralph Bernal (1783–1854), a British Whig politician and actor.
Wilde has said that as a result of her parents' occupations, she has a "strong journalistic streak," being "really critical and analytical. Both her parents were prominent in the Washington social scene, hosting dinner parties. Her mother once recounted a story of a four-year-old Wilde eavesdropping one night on a conversation between diplomat Richard Holbrooke and singer Mick Jagger, until Jagger noticed her and shooed her to bed. She has wanted to become an actress since the age of two. For a short time, Wilde's family had a house in Guilford, Vermont. She attended Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C., as well as Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, graduating in 2002. She also studied acting at the Gaiety School of Acting in Dublin, Ireland. Wilde had writer Christopher Hitchens as a babysitter.
Career.
She has appeared in the movies "The Girl Next Door", "Alpha Dog", "Conversations with Other Women" and "Turistas". She became known for her role on "The O.C." as Alex Kelly, although she originally auditioned for the role of Marissa Cooper. She has also appeared in the Dashboard Confessional music video for "Stolen", and the French Kicks music video for "So Far We Are".
In 2007, Wilde was a part of the ensemble cast of the short-lived NBC mid-season drama "The Black Donnellys". Her character, Jenny Reilly, was a principal female character in the series following the lives of an Irish-American family tied to organized crime in New York City. Also in 2007, Wilde appeared in the play "Beauty on the Vine", a political thriller, playing three different characters.
Wilde joined the cast of the Fox medical drama "House" in September 2007, making her first appearance in the episode "The Right Stuff". She played a secretive and bisexual young internist with Huntington's disease, Dr. Remy Hadley, nicknamed Thirteen, who was handpicked by House out of a number of applicants to join his team. Wilde told "Star" magazine how she sometimes took cues from her character even when she was not working, saying, "I'm now convinced that I'm a doctor. I mean, if someone says they have a pain, I'm like, 'Well, that's your spleen.'" On October 7, 2008, Wilde appeared in a video on Funny or Die showing how much she enjoys registering early for the 2008 Presidential election, "Olivia Wilde Does It Early". She appeared in the 2009 comedy film "Year One".
She played Quorra in Disney's ', which opened on December 17, 2010. In the December 2010/January 2011 issue of "Details" Wilde was quoted as saying she panicked the first time she saw her costume for the movie: "I saw the boobs on the suit and I said, 'Oh hell no. I'm doing kicks and backflips in this thing? She also reprised her role as Quorra in ' in the episode "Isolated". She was seen in flashbacks of Paige's past, where she befriended Quorra, not knowing that she was an ISO (isomorphic algorithm) at the time.
Wilde played Ella Swenson in the science fiction Western film "Cowboys & Aliens". Her character works with Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig), and Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), to save their town from evil aliens. Wilde played Sabrina McKay in the comedy film "The Change-Up". Her character is the love interest of Mitch Planko, who was played by Ryan Reynolds. In January 2011, it was announced that Wilde was cast alongside Chris Pine in the film "People Like Us", released in June 2012.
In August 2011, it was announced Wilde would be leaving "House" to pursue her film career. Wilde left "House" a few months later, in the episode "Charity Case". In May 2012, Wilde returned to "House" for the final two episodes, "Holding On" and "Everybody Dies". "The New York Observer" has described Wilde as having a "throaty voice" and the "wide, teal-eyed charisma of Hollywood in the days of yore". She has cited Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, Frances McDormand, Catherine Keener and Robin Wright Penn as acting inspirations.
She won the 2006 US Comedy Arts Festival Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Actress for "Bickford Shmeckler's Cool Ideas" (2006), and in 2008 at the Teen Choice Awards, she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Breakout Star Female for "House". Also in 2008, Wilde was honored alongside Jesse Eisenberg with the Vail Film Festival Rising Star Award. On September 24, 2013, "Variety" and "Entertainment Weekly" reported that Wilde guest voice-starred in the long-running adult animated series "American Dad!", the episode slated to air as part of the show's 10th season (2013–14).
In February 2014, it was announced that Wilde will star and produce in the thriller "Meadowland" directed by Reed Morano from a script by Chris Rossi.
Personal life.
Wilde has dual citizenship in the United States and Ireland. She derived her stage name "Wilde" from Irish author Oscar Wilde. She changed her surname while in high school, to honor the writers in her family, many of whom used pen names. She is a vegan, and was voted PETA's Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity of 2010.
Relationships.
On June 7, 2003, Wilde married Tao Ruspoli, an Italian filmmaker and musician, whose family owns a famed palazzo in Italy, in Washington, Virginia, on a school bus with only a pair of witnesses, when she was nineteen years old. She later said the marriage occurred in an abandoned school bus because it was the only place where they could be completely alone, as the marriage was a secret at the time. On February 8, 2011, she and Ruspoli announced that they were separating. Wilde filed for divorce in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 3, 2011, citing "irreconcilable differences". The divorce was finalized on September 29, 2011. Wilde did not seek spousal support, and the pair reached a private agreement on property division.
Wilde began dating actor Jason Sudeikis in November 2011, and they became engaged in January 2013. They have one son, Otis Alexander (born April 20, 2014).
Political activism.
Wilde is a board member of Artists for Peace and Justice, which provides education and health services in Haiti, and the ACLU of Southern California. Previously, Wilde was a supporter of the youth voter organization, 18 in '08. She serves on their advisory council and appeared in a public service announcement that debuted June 30, 2008. In 2008, Wilde campaigned with actors Justin Long and her then-current "House" castmate Kal Penn for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama.
She also appeared in the MoveOn.org mock-PSA "supporting" the rights of the healthcare insurance industry.
Wilde was commended by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a farmworkers' union, for supporting the Fair Foods campaign. In 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci's "Chime for Change" campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women's issues in terms of education, health, and justice.

Hofgartenkaserne

The Hofgartenkaserne, also known as Infanterie-Leibregiment-Kaserne or Max-Joseph-Kaserne, was a military facility of the Bavarian army, located at "Hofgarten Strasse 2" in Munich, Germany. The construction was planned and realized by the war economy councillor Direktorialrat Joseph Frey from 1801 to 1807.
History.
Because the existing barracks of the Munich garrison had an unfavourable tactical location, and some of them fell into disrepair, Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria decided to build the new kaserne at the northern outskirts of old Munich in the eastern Hofgarten, and a smaller one nearby, the Seidenhauskaserne.
Originally the Hofgartenkaserne, which was conceived for 1.800 people, should be built on the fundament of the old silk factory covering the city ditch at the eastern border of the Hofgarten. The large pond of the Hofgarten should be filled up for the later barrack yard. But in consequence of the millers's protests, who needed the ditch for their mill wheels, the foundation stone was laid more westwards over the quickly filled up pond in 1801. At first the 1st Lines Lifeguards Regiment moved into the four-storied building in 1804, but it was not completed until 1807. The total costs of construction were 256.629 Gulden. On the occasion of completion, in 1801 the Bavarian medailleur and punchcutter Cajetan Destouches (C.D.; born 1769 – died 1833 in Munich) edited a medal in honor of Maximilian I Joseph.
The Hofgartenkaserne was never fully occupied. The conditions inside the building soon turned out to be unhealthy. It was assumed, that the subsoil below the building was too boggy because the filled-up pond was not drained enough before its construction. The inhabitants suffered consistently from illness, and the cases of typhoid were also considered as a result. Due to the epidemic in the Hofgarten- and the Seidenhauskaserne in 1893, when 34 lifeguards died and 8 became invalid, a meeting of scientists, physicians, military, engineers and representatives of the city was scheduled to clarify the reasons. Chairman of the meeting was the Bavarian minister of war Adolph von Asch. Due to a missing uniform conclusion, von Asch decided to apply for closing the barracks at the prince regent, who accepted the motion on July 18, 1893. The Hofgartenkaserne was fully evacuated in the end of the same year, the Lehel-Kaserne and the Seidenhauskaserne a view years later. After the army's plan to sell the building was jettisoned in 1898, the building slated for demolition in 1899 to make way for an army museum.
The Bavarian Army Museum, which was built a few steps more westwards on a new fundament after 1901, was opened in 1905 and existed until the end of World War II. The building remained in ruins. The central dome building was rebuilt and is the central part of today's Bavarian Staatskanzlei's building ("State Chancellery"), which was completed in 1993.

50000 Quaoar

50000 Quaoar ("Kwawar") is a rocky planetoid in the Kuiper belt with one known moon. It is probably a dwarf planet.
Discovery.
Quaoar was discovered on June 4, 2002 by astronomers Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown at the California Institute of Technology, from images acquired at the Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory. The discovery of this magnitude 18.5 object, located in the constellation Ophiuchus, was announced on October 7, 2002, at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. The earliest prediscovery image proved to be a May 25, 1954 plate from Palomar Observatory.
Name.
Quaoar is named for the Tongva creator god, following International Astronomical Union naming conventions for non-resonant Kuiper belt objects. The Tongva are the native people of the area around Los Angeles, where the discovery of Quaoar was made. Brown "et al." had picked the name with the more intuitive spelling "Kwawar", but the preferred spelling among the Tongva was "Qua-o-ar".
Prior to IAU approval of the name, Quaoar went by the provisional designation . The minor planet number 50000 was not coincidence, but chosen to commemorate a particularly large object found in the search for a Pluto-sized object in the Kuiper belt, parallel to the similarly numbered 20000 Varuna. However, later even larger discoveries were simply numbered according to the order in which their orbits were confirmed.
Size.
In 2004, Quaoar was estimated to have a diameter of , subsequently revised downward, which at the time of discovery in 2002 made it the largest object found in the Solar System since the discovery of Pluto. Quaoar was later supplanted by , , , and . Quaoar is about as massive as (if somewhat smaller than) Pluto's moon Charon, which is approximately 2½ times as massive as . Quaoar is roughly one twelfth the diameter of Earth, one third the diameter of the Moon, and half the size of Pluto.
Quaoar was the first trans-Neptunian object to be measured "directly" from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, using a new, sophisticated method (see Brown’s pages for a non-technical description and his paper for details). Given its distance Quaoar is on the limit of the HST resolution (40 milliarcseconds) and its image is consequently "smeared" on a few adjacent pixels. By comparing carefully this image with the images of stars in the background and using a sophisticated model of HST optics (point spread function (PSF)), Brown and Trujillo were able to find the best-fit disk size that would give a similar blurred image. This method was recently applied by the same authors to measure the size of Eris.
The uncorrected 2004 HST estimates only marginally agree with the 2007 infrared measurements by the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) that suggest a brighter albedo (0.19) and consequently a smaller diameter (). During the 2004 HST observations, little was known about the surface properties of Kuiper belt objects, but we now know that the surface of Quaoar is in many ways similar to those of the icy satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Adopting a Uranian-satellite limb darkening profile suggests that the 2004 HST size estimate for Quaoar was approximately 40% too large, and that a more proper estimate would be about 900 km. Using a weighted average of the SST and corrected HST estimates, Quaoar, as of 2010, can be estimated at about in diameter.
On 4 May 2011 Quaoar occulted a 16th-magnitude star, which gave 1170 km as the longest chord and suggests an elongated shape. New measurement from Herschel Space Observatory with revised data from SST suggested that Quaoar has diameter and Weywot .
Dwarf planet?
Because Quaoar is a binary object, the mass of the system can be calculated from the orbit of the secondary. Quaoar's estimated density of around 2.2 g/cm3 and estimated size of 1,100 km suggests that it should qualify as a dwarf planet if the mass required for hydrostatic equilibrium is proven. Mike Brown estimates that rocky bodies around 900 km in diameter relax into hydrostatic equilibrium, and that icy bodies relax into hydrostatic equilibrium somewhere between 200 and 400 km. With an estimated mass greater than 1.6 kg, Quaoar has the mass and diameter "usually" required for being in hydrostatic equilibrium according to the 2006 IAU draft definition of a planet (5 kg, 800 km), and Brown states that Quaoar "must be" a dwarf planet. Light-curve-amplitude analysis shows only small deviations, suggesting that Quaoar is indeed a spheroid with small albedo spots and hence a dwarf planet.
Hit-and-run collision.
Planetary scientist Erik Asphaug has suggested that Quaoar may have collided with a much larger body, stripping the lower-density mantle from Quaoar, and leaving behind the denser core. He envisions that Quaoar was originally covered by a mantle of ice that made it 300 to 500 kilometers bigger than it is today, and that it collided with another Kuiper-belt body about twice its size—an object roughly the diameter of Pluto (or even approaching the size of Mars), possibly Pluto itself.
Orbit.
Quaoar orbits at about from the Sun with an orbital period of 286 years. Its orbit is nearly circular and moderately inclined at approximately 8°, typical for the population of small classical Kuiper-belt objects (KBO) but exceptional among the large KBO. Pluto, , , , , and are all on highly inclined, more eccentric orbits.
Quaoar is the largest body that is classified as a cubewano by both the Minor Planet Center and the Deep Ecliptic Survey.
The polar view compares the near-circular Quaoar's orbit to highly eccentric (e=0.25) orbit of (Quaoar’s orbit in blue, Pluto’s in red, Neptune in grey). The spheres illustrate the current (April 2006) positions, relative sizes and colours. The perihelia (q), aphelia (Q) and the dates of passage are also marked.
At 43 AU and a near-circular orbit, Quaoar is not significantly perturbed by Neptune, unlike Pluto, which is in 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. The ecliptic view illustrates the relative inclinations of the orbits of Quaoar and Pluto. Note that Pluto's aphelion is beyond (and below) Quaoar's orbit, so that Pluto is closer to the Sun than Quaoar at some times of its orbit, and farther at others.
As of 2008, Quaoar was only 14 AU from Pluto, which made it the closest large body to the Pluto–Charon system. By Kuiper Belt standards this is very close.
Physical characteristics.
Quaoar's albedo could be as low as 0.1, which would still be much higher than the lower estimate of 0.04 for . This may indicate that fresh ice has disappeared from Quaoar's surface. The surface is moderately red, meaning that the object is relatively more reflective in the red and near-infrared than in the blue. 20000 Varuna and 28978 Ixion are also moderately red in the spectral class. Larger KBOs are often much brighter because they are covered in more fresh ice and have a higher albedo, and thus they present a neutral colour (see colour comparison).
A 2006 model of internal heating via radioactive decay did not suggest that, unlike Orcus, Quaoar may not be capable of sustaining an internal ocean of liquid water at the mantle–core boundary.
Cryovolcanism.
In 2004, scientists were surprised to find signs of crystalline ice on Quaoar, indicating that the temperature rose to at least −160 °C (110 K or −260 °F) sometime in the last ten million years.
Speculation began as to what could have caused Quaoar to heat up from its natural temperature of −220 °C (55 K or −360 °F). Some have theorized that a barrage of mini-meteors may have raised the temperature, but the most discussed theory speculates that cryovolcanism may be occurring, spurred by the decay of radioactive elements within Quaoar's core.
Since then (2006), crystalline water ice was also found on , but present in larger quantities and thought to be responsible for the very high albedo of that object (0.7).
More precise (2007) observations of Quaoar's near infrared spectrum indicate the presence of small (5%) quantity of (solid) methane and ethane.
Given its boiling point (112 K), methane is a volatile ice at average Quaoar surface temperatures, unlike water ice or ethane (boiling point 185 K). Both models and observations suggest that only a few larger bodies (Pluto, , ) can retain the volatile ices whereas the dominant population of small TNOs lost them. Quaoar, with only small amounts of methane, appears to be in an intermediary category.
If the "New Horizons" mission visits a small Kuiper-belt object after visiting Pluto in 2015, our knowledge of the surfaces of KBOs should improve.
Satellite.
Quaoar has one known satellite, Weywot, formally (50000) Quaoar I Weywot. Its discovery was reported in IAUC 8812 on 22 February 2007. The satellite was found at 0.35 arcsec from Quaoar with an apparent magnitude difference of 5.6. It orbits at a distance of 14,500 km from the primary and has an orbital eccentricity of about 0.14. Assuming an equal albedo and density to the primary, the apparent magnitude suggests that the moon has a diameter of about 74 km (1:12 of Quaoar). Brown believes it is likely to be a collisional fragment of Quaoar, which he speculates lost much of its ice mantle in the process. Weywot is estimated to only have 1:2000 the mass of Quaoar.
Brown left the choice of a name up to the Tongva, who chose the sky god Weywot, son of Quaoar. The name was made official in MPC #67220 published on October 4, 2009.

Harold Speed

Harold Speed (11 February 1872 - 20 March 1957) was an English painter in oil and watercolour of portraits, figures and historical subjects.
Born in London, the son of Edward Speed, an architect, he studied architecture at the Royal College of Art, but soon took up painting, and continued his studies at the Royal Academy Schools between 1891 and 1896, winning a gold medal and a travelling scholarship in 1893. In 1896, he was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters.
He exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1893, and held his first one-man exhibition in 1907 at the Leicester Galleries. In 1930 he provided paintings for the new chapel of Wesley House, Cambridge.
Speed lived in Watlington, Oxfordshire and London, where he died on 20 March 1957.
Because of their intelligent combination of useful advice and sensitive reflection on the nature and meaning of artistic practice, Harold Speed's instructional manuals on drawing and painting have long been considered valuable resources for artists. There are editions of his manual "The Practice and Science of Drawing" (1913) in the public domain.

Your Disease Risk

Your Disease Risk is a publicly available health risk assessment tool on the Internet. Launched in early 2000 and continually updated, the site offers risk assessments for twelve different cancers and four other important chronic diseases: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis.
The site began in 1998 as a pen and paper questionnaire called the Harvard Cancer Risk Index. In January 2000, The Harvard Cancer Risk Index developed into an online assessment and was renamed Your Cancer Risk, and offered assessments for four cancers: breast, colon, lung, and prostate. Six months later, eight additional cancers were added. 
In 2004, the site was renamed Your Disease Risk to reflect the addition of four further conditions: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Since many common chronic diseases share risk factors, the renaming promoted the importance of a healthy lifestyle to lowering disease risks.
In 2007, the site moved to the Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine.
In 2011, researchers released a related iPad app, called Zuum, that offers customized advice for healthier living based on an individual's diet, exercise and other habits. 
User Experience.
Your Disease Risk has a simple, straightforward interface. Questionnaires can be completed in a matter of minutes, and for each disease, the site offers both a visual and verbal risk estimate as well as personalized tips for prevention. The site can also show users what their risk could be should they adopt various healthy behaviors. Tailored screening tips and recommendations for making health changes in communities are also part of site results.
Methodology.
The calculations and algorithms used to calculate and display risk estimates in Your Disease Risk are the product of an ongoing process of expert consensus. Epidemiologists, clinicians, and other health specialists regularly review the current scientific evidence for each disease, identifying established and probable risk factors for each. This information is then used to develop or revise calculations that generate a user’s risk of disease compared to average risk in the population for someone of the same age and sex. 
A validation study found Your Disease Risk to provide well calibrated estimates of cancer risk in the general population. For individual women, the discriminatory accuracy for colon cancer was 0.67, for ovarian cancer 0.59, and for pancreatic cancer was 0.71. For individual men, the discriminatory accuracy for colon cancer was 0.71 and for pancreatic cancer was 0.72. These values exceed the performance of many other cancer risk prediction tools.
The approach used to calculate cancer risks in Your Disease Risk is also used to calculate the risks of the other diseases. Validation studies for these non-cancer estimates are ongoing.
Awards and Media.
A winner of the eHealthcare Leadership Award, Your Disease Risk has also been the topic of articles in major media outlets.

List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer

__NOTOC__
The following is a list of paintings by the Dutch Baroque artist Johannes Vermeer. After two or three early history paintings, he concentrated almost entirely on genre works, typically interiors with one or two figures. His popularity is due less to his subject matter than to the poetic manner in which he portrays his subjects. Vermeer's paintings of the 1660s are generally more popular than his work from the 1670s: in the eyes of some, his later work is colder.
Today, 34 paintings are firmly attributed to him, with question marks over a further three. This compares to the 74 pictures attributed to him by Thoré Burger in 1866. Vermeer's reputation increased greatly during the latter half of the 20th century, a period during which the number of paintings ascribed to him shrank greatly. This is partly because he has been one of the most widely forged artists, and many forgeries have now been identified. No drawings or preparatory paintings are known. Many Vermeer paintings are known by various names, and alternative names are noted below. Years of creation are only estimates for most of the paintings, and sources often give different, though not widely divergent, estimates. In addition to the known paintings listed below, historical documents seem to describe at least six other, lost, works.
Disputed Paintings.
Historical documents such as auction records suggest that Vermeer painted a number of other works, now presumably destroyed, lost to public view, or possibly wrongly attributed to other artists. While a list of these lost Vermeers must necessarily be tentative, it may include:

Anthony Pohlmann was a Hanoverian soldier who served in the armies of the British East India Company and Daulat Scindia. Pohlmann arrived in India as a sergeant in a Hanoverian regiment serving the East India Company in Madras. He deserted his regiment in 1792 or 1793 and took employment in the army of the Maratha prince, Daulat Scindia. He served under the French mercenary Benoît de Boigne, who promoted him to captain in 1794. By 1795 he was in command of a battalion of infantry, serving alongside the Anglo-Indian military adventurer, James Skinner. In early 1799, Pierre Cuillier-Perron – who superseded de Boigne as the overall commander of Scindia's troops – promoted Pohlmann to colonel and gave him command of Scindia's second brigade. At the Battle of Assaye in 1803, Pohlmann effectively commanded all the regular battalions in the Maratha army, after Scindia and the Rajah of Berar absented themselves before the battle. Some historians, however, claim that Pohlmann was not present at Assaye, but had been imprisoned for refusing to fight the British. He re-entered service with the East India Company as a lieutenant colonel in 1804.

List of Coronation Street characters (1999)

The following is a list of characters that first appeared in the ITV soap opera "Coronation Street" in 1999, by order of first appearance.
Nita Desai.
Nita Desai arrives in January as a new assistant at the Corner Shop, which her family later take over. Nita was played by Rebecca Sarker.
Ravi Desai.
Ravi Desai took over the running of the Corner Shop on Coronation Street in 1999. Played by actor Saeed Jaffrey, Ravi left Weatherfield due to family issues later in the year and sold his empire of convenience stores in the area to a cousin of Vikram's (Chris Bisson), Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin).
Darren Dobbs.
Darren Dobbs is the father of Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) who appears on 25 January 1999 to take his wife Jackie (Margi Clarke) home to Liverpool.
Vikram Desai.
Vikram Desai was played by Chris Bisson. Vikram is Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) cousin and he used to own the shop with Dev and worked with Sunita (Shobna Gulati). During his time in Coronation Street he dated Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) and Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie). In 2002 he was forced to smuggle drugs in from abroad then again, but this time he asked Steve (Simon Gregson) and Karen McDonald (Suranne Jones) if they wanted a free holiday and they accepted. When they came back Steve discovered powder at the bottom of his suitcase and inside was drugs, and found out that Vikram had done it. Karen was horrified as well as Steve and he dumped the drugs in the canal and told Vikram to leave Weatherfield for good, and if he comes back Steve said he will kill him. He now lives in India. 
Vikram was mentioned when Sunita's aunts came to stay in 2010, after Dev said that they were even worse than him.
Tom Ferguson.
Tom Ferguson, played by actor Tom Wisdom, is the son of Duggie Ferguson, who arrives later in the year. Tom is a hairdresser, and worked at Audrey Roberts' salon until he quit in January 2000 and left Weatherfield to get away from his father.
Boris Weaver.
Boris Weaver was a butcher who worked for Ashley Peacock at Elliott and Sons butchers. Boris appeared for the first time in 1999 and appeared recurrently and made his last appearance at Christmas 2004, at Ashley's wedding to Claire Casey. From then on, Boris was still referred to and looked after the shop when Ashley was away. In later years both Kirk Sutherland and Graeme Proctor successively worked for Ashley at the shop, it is assumed that Boris was no longer an employee there.
Danny Hargreaves.
Danny Hargreaves is played by Richard Standing between 1999 and 2001. A market trader, Danny meets Sally Webster at work and begins a relationship with her. Danny and Sally fell in love and got engaged, but he broke off the engagement soon after when he discovered Sally had previously been unfaithful to ex-husband Kevin.
Beryl Peacock.
Beryl Hayden Peacock (née Elliott) is the sister of Fred Elliott. Beryl and her husband Sam had raised Fred's son, Ashley, as their own. Beryl first appeared when Ashley asked her for the truth about his parentage and she was forced to tell Ashley that she was actually his Aunt, not his mother. Beryl made her most recent appearance at Fred's funeral in October 2006.
Belinda Peach.
Belinda Peach appears briefly at the "Freshco's" Summer Ball where she tries to woo Ashley Peacock. Ashley is amused by Fred Elliott's attempts to pair him with Belinda, despite him attending with Maxine Heavey. Maxine gets annoyed by Belinda's overly friendly manner and pushes her in the direction of Curly Watts.
Doreen Heavey.
Doreen Heavey (née Outhwaite) is the mother of Maxine Peacock, played by actress Prunella Gee, who had three spells on the Street between 1999 and 2004; the third of these covering the period of her daughter's death at the hands of Richard Hillman in early 2003 after which she moved back in with her ex-husband Derek, Maxine's father, in order to give their relationship another go. Doreen was last seen in November 2004 when she, Ashley and her grandson Joshua went to lay flowers on Maxine's grave on what would have been her 29th birthday. She told Ashley that she liked his new fiancee Claire Casey and gave him her blessing to marry Claire.
Vinny Sorrell.
Vinny Sorrell, played by James Gaddas appeared for a period of 15 months between 1999 and 2000. He has an on/off relationship with Natalie Barnes throughout, and works alongside her at the Rovers Return as a barman and cellarman. Vinny departs Weatherfield in November 2000 after his affair with Natalie's sister Debs Brownlow is revealed. Vinny moves to Southampton with Debs where she gets a new job. Unbeknownst to Vinny, Natalie is pregnant with his child and she gives birth to their daughter, Laura, off-screen in 2001.
Daniel Cross.
Daniel Cross, played by George Sorby, was a 4-year-old schoolboy who was lost on "Coronation Street" after wandering away from the school playground. He was later taken home by Ken Barlow (William Roache).
Kathleen Gutteridge.
Kathleen Gutteridge is the biological mother of Ashley Peacock. She is first mentioned when Fred Elliott reveals that he is Ashley's father. Fred tries to talk him out of finding her as it would hurt Ashley's adoptive mother (in reality his aunt), Beryl Peacock. Kathleen had abandoned Ashley when he was born and Fred gave him to his sister, Beryl and her husband Sam.
When Kathleen and Ashley eventually meet, Ashley is very bitter towards her. However, they are able to eventually reconcile and Kathleen attends Ashley's wedding to Maxine Heavey.
Fred tries to woo Kathleen again, but she turns him down.
Gwen Davies.
Gwen Davies (formerly Loveday) is a machinist at Underworld, played by Annie Hulley for a period of eight months from 1999 to 2000.
Duggie Ferguson.
Douglas William "Duggie" Ferguson was played by John Bowe. 
An ex-rugby league player who went into the printing business, he first came to Coronation Street after tracking down his son Tom, who worked as a hairdresser for Audrey Roberts. Tom blamed his father for his mother's death and did not want him around. Duggie was hurt by this and bought into a local development on Victoria Street to be close to Tom but there was no reconciliation and Tom left Weatherfield and moved to Leeds.
In late 1999 to early 2000, Duggie turned property developer and employed Steve McDonald as foreman for the building of his Victoria Street complex - those who rented the commercial units included Sally Webster and Danny Hargreaves, butcher Fred Elliott, and Vikram Desai and Steve McDonald, who started up their own mini-cab firm.
Early in 2000 Duggie started a relationship with Debs Brownlow, sister of Rovers landlady Natalie Barnes. Debs had moved to Weatherfield to be near to her sister after many years working on a cruise ship as a hairdresser. Debs helped Duggie overcome his emotional block concerning women, and the couple seemed happy until Duggie started to develop another property and tried to forcibly evict tenants including Toyah Battersby and Phil Simmons. Both felt that they had been treated badly, especially when Duggie employed Vinny Sorrell to throw Simmons out of his own home. Simmons went to the press, and the adverse report caused Duggie's financial downfall, forcing him to sell the home which he had shared with wife Laura. Dev Alahan bought Duggie's home for a quick sale, before putting it back on the market and making a tidy profit. Duggie was forced to move into No 6 with girlfriend Debs Brownlow, hoping to use it as an office for his business contacts. Debs had a fling with Vinny - her sister's lover and Duggie's employee. Duggie was furious when Vinny and Debs left town with £400 of rent money.
In December 2000 Natalie decided to sell up, and the Rovers came under threat by a chain who planned to turn it into a 'fun pub' named the Boozy Newt. Duggie stepped in to help the Rovers overcome this fate, but could not buy the place, so it was Fred Elliott and Mike Baldwin who invested in the Rovers alongside Duggie. Neither of the trio wanted to run the place, so they employed Liz McDonald to run it. Liz moved into the Rovers with resident barmaid Toyah Battersby, but her reign as manager was short as, after numerous disagreements with the trio, and husband Jim being transferred to a prison in Leicester, she quit the Rovers and Weatherfield. Mike's new wife Linda took the helm of the Rovers, but her heart was not in it, and Duggie talked his partners into selling their shares of the Rovers cheaply to a 'mysterious owner' - Duggie snapped up their shares and became sole owner of the Rovers.
At the end of 2001, the social club at Duggie's beloved Weatherfield Rugby League club came up for sale. Looking for a quick way to raise money, Duggie auctioned off the Rovers - to Fred Elliott ! - for £76,000, only to find he had been gazumped for the Rugby Club at the last minute by fellow ex-professional Marty Flynn. With time and money on his hands, he went into partnership with Richard Hillman, converting an old house - 'Oakhill' into luxury flats. Duggie was determined to cut corners, preferably without Richard's knowledge. But Richard suspected this, and one night confronted Duggie at the development. Hoist by his own petard, Duggie leant over a banister which collapsed, and he plunged two floors. The fall didn't kill him outright, but Richard chose to rifle through Duggie's pockets, take his keys and raid his safe, taking the cash from the sale of the Rovers, rather than summon help. Duggie was later found to have crawled to another room and died. His son Tom was ostensibly too busy cutting hair on a cruise ship to attend his father's funeral.
Candice Stowe.
Candice Marie Islandos (née Stowe) was played by Nikki Sanderson.
Candice first appeared in 1999 as Sarah-Louise Platt's best friend from school. She attempted to get Sarah to smoke. She and Sarah were both thirteen at the time. Candice was one of the first people Sarah told of her pregnancy. While many of Sarah's friends turned against Sarah, Candice stuck by her throughout the pregnancy and birth of her daughter Bethany in 2000. Candice proved to be a good friend in times of crisis during Sarah's life, for example she and Todd Grimshaw were instrumental in Sarah being able to evade the clutches of her paedophile kidnapper Gary in July 2001. As they grew up Candice, Sarah and their friend Maria Sutherland began to turn the heads of The Street's men and became increasingly popular with male viewers of the show.
Candice struggled to get along with her mother and has no contact with her. Their relationship broke down when Candice's mother would not believe that she was being sexually harassed by her mother's boyfriend. Audrey Roberts soon took pity on her and she moved into the salon flat with Maria and Fiz Brown. Candice then went on to work as a trainee hairdresser in Audrey's salon. She went for a catwalk modelling job which proved to be a humiliating disaster for her. She did however have a softer side and she was known to cry on several occasions. 
During her time on the show, Candice dated Todd Grimshaw, his brother Jason and Warren Baldwin. Todd broke up with her after discovering that she had slept with Jason. She also had an extremely brief fling with Nick Tilsley who dumped her for Maria. Another disastrous fling beckoned when she dated Tim, a travelling shampoo rep whom she soon discovered was married. When promising footballer Warren Baldwin arrived in Weatherfield with his family in the summer of 2004 she dreamed of fame and soon got together with him. Unfortunately for her, he ended their relationship when he left to play for a Spanish team. Candice also dated Adam Barlow, Warren's Uncle but later dumped him via text message as she left the street in late 2005 when Status Quo offered her a job as a stylist. 
On 26 March 2007, Sarah revealed that Candice had become engaged in Greece and asked her to be her bridesmaid. Sarah then went over to attend the wedding. Candice currently works for a company that sells speed boats.
Dev Alahan.
Devendra "Dev" Alahan is a fictional character from the long-running soap opera, "Coronation Street". He is played by Jimmi Harkishin, and made his first appearance on 10 November 1999. He is the ex-husband of Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati), and father to Amber Kalirai (Nikki Patel), Aadi Alahan (Zennon Ditchett) and Asha Alahan (Tanisha Gorey), although Amber is not Sunita's daughter. Dev has had many affairs, including ones with Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride) and Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), and a friendship with Stella Price (Michelle Collins), whom Dev later develops feelings for. In 2012, Dev discovered that Sunita had been having a affair with Karl Munro (John Michie), and attacked him, though Karl's partner Stella slapped Sunita. In March 2013, Sunita was trapped in a fire at The Rovers Return, which was started by Karl. Sunita would've made it, but Karl pulled out her oxygen tube and she suffered a cardiac arrest and died.
Rebecca Hopkins.
Rebecca Hopkins was a nurse, played by actress Jill Halfpenny, who had an affair with Martin Platt. Rebecca's husband Jerry was violent towards her, and after Martin helped Rebecca to get away from him, the pair fell in love and Martin was prepared to leave his wife Gail for Rebecca. However, when Gail's daughter Sarah-Louise fell pregnant aged just thirteen, Martin felt compelled to stay with his family and ended the affair. Rebecca left Weatherfield a few months later and moved to Dubai where she had been offered a new job, but the damage to the Platt's marriage was already done and Gail and Martin separated later that year. In December 2000, Martin spotted Rebecca whilst out Christmas Shopping. He tracked her down to a friend's house where she was staying. They bade each other farewell tearfully but gave into their feelings for each other and ended up sleeping together again. Rebecca explained to Martin that she planned to move to Dubai permanently and offered him the chance to go with her for a fresh start but Martin refused, not wanting to abandon his children and Rebecca left for Dubai alone.

History.
In 1996, Dr. Senthil B. Kumar established EdNET, a network of IT education, training, and certification centers worldwide with franchise centers in many countries including the U.S, Canada, UK, Norway, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand,and India. Between 1998 and 2000, EdNET established educational partnership alliances with Microsoft, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Lotus and CIW to offer Information Technology Certifications, Internet Software Services Training and Certification. Also, the company offered testing services through its network of Authorized Prometric Testing Centers. In 2001, EdNET was partially acquired by a leading training company.
In 2001, Dr. Kumar transformed some of the EdNET Centers into Qsofttraining.net Training Centers. Qsoft offered specialized Microsoft.NET training solutions even before the .NET framework was officially launched in 2002. 
In 2002, Qsoft was renamed iUniversity, and offered Global Business Programs, IT Certifications and Management Training Courses. iUniversity, in alliance with Benchmark Online, entered into an International Marketing Associate (IMA) Agreement with the University of Washington to promote Online Executive Certificate Programs. iUniversity was later diversified as California University of Technology. iUniversity, California University of Technology and Benchmark were all corporate initiatives under the parent company iGLOBAL group, an incubation and angel funding company started by Dr. Kumar. iGLOBAL also partnered with American Education Systems, founded in Chicago, Illinois. The management decided to move the institutional operations to California to capitalize on the robust technology environment and cosmopolitanism of the state. 
In 2003, California University of Technology was incorporated in the State of California and started its initial operations in the city of West Covina. The founding members were Dr. Michael Zullo, Dr. Richard Allen and Mr. Larry Golda with Dr. Kumar as the President and CEO. 
In 2005, the university received California State Approval ( which is not accreditation) to grant undergraduate and graduate degrees. Dr. Kumar and Dr. Finian Tan, Chairman of Vickers Financial Group, together as founder and co-founder of the university, have been funding its growth jointly through iGlobal and Vickers Financial Group.
In 2009, CalUniversity was accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC). The Accrediting Commission of DETC is listed by the U.S. Department of Education as a nationally recognized accrediting agency and it is also a recognized member of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation . Many employers do not consider "national accreditation" to be as reputable as "regional accreditation." After receiving DETC accreditation, the university changed its name to better reflect its global scope and outreach to the California InterContinental University; its trade name of "CalUniversity" remains in use.

Primary schools in Hertsmere

This page provides brief details of primary schools in the borough of Hertsmere in Hertfordshire, England, United Kingdom.
All the state-funded primary schools in Hertsmere are co-educational.
There are two Jewish schools, three Roman Catholic schools and three Church of England schools in the district, all of which are voluntary aided schools with the exception of St John's (Radlett) which is a voluntary controlled school.
Except for four foundation schools, the remaining schools are all non-faith community schools.
The Local Education Authority is Hertfordshire County Council.
There are still some linked pairs of infant schools and junior schools, with the infant school covering Reception and Key Stage 1 (Years 1 and 2) and the junior school covering Key Stage 2 (Years 3 to 6).
However most have been amalgamated in a single Junior Mixed Infant (JMI) school or (equivalently) primary school.
Bushey.
The first public elementary schools in Bushey were national schools, established in 1827 in buildings near St James's church.
As usual for the time, there were separate schools for infants and older boys and girls.
A non-denominational British school for boys was built on Merry Hill Lane (now School Lane) in 1845, after which the boys' national school soon closed.
In 1866, Arthur Ashfield donated £5455 to the boys' school, which was renamed Ashfield School in 1919.
When the Bushey school board was established in 1879, it took over the running of the three schools, moving the girls' and infants schools from the Congregational Church lecture hall to new premises on Merry Hill Lane in 1885.
The girls' school was renamed Bushey Girls' Board School in 1889, and Merry Hill Board School in 1900, amalgamating with the infants department in 1923.
In 1972 the last junior girls left the school, now known as Merry Hill Infants School and linked with Ashfield School.
The board also established an infants school on The Rutts in 1879, absorbing a girls' and infants school founded in 1850.
The school was extended and modernised in 1967, becoming Bushey Heath Primary School.
The Bushey board also built schools for infants, boys and girls on London Road, on the site now occupied by Bushey Health Centre.
The infants school was abolished in 1929, when the girls' school became a senior school.
London Road Boys' Elementary School moved to Grange Road in 1957, becoming Bushey Manor Junior School in the 1960s.
It is linked with Bushey and Oxhey Infant School, which is just inside the boundary of Watford.
Radlett and Shenley.
St Martin's School was established in Shenley in 1841, next to the church, which was built at the same time.
It was a national school, and catered for boys only.
In 1853 the National School for Girls (now the village hall) was built.
The Shenley School Board was established in 1878, and built a Board School for Girls and Infants, replacing the girls' national school.
The board school building on London Road forms part of Shenley Primary School today.
The first elementary school serving Radlett, Elstree and Borehamwood was Medburn Boys Elementary School established in 1864 on Watling Street to the south of Radlett.
The school was built by the Brewers' Company to replace the demolished lower school of Aldenham School.
In the 1870s, the Charity Commission redistributed the proceeds of the sale of land owned by the Platt foundation of Aldenham School, directing £8000 to local elementary schools.
The Medburn school received part of this, and Radlett Girls and Infant Elementary School was built at the bottom of Loom Lane in 1878.
A separate infants school was established in Cobden Hill in 1902.
All three schools were run by the Church of England until 1944.
By the late 1950s, after the construction of Fair Field Junior School.
the Loom lane and Cobden Hill buildings operated just as an infant school with what are now year 1 classes at Cobden Hill and year 2 classes at Loom Lane. They closed in the 1960s, after the construction of Newberries Primary School and St Johns Church of England Infant and Nursery School . The buildings of the former boys' school are now Medburn Kennels, while the former girls' school buildings are now a private house and the Youth and Community Centre.
The Platt funds were also used to establish Delrow Boys Elementary School in Summerhouse Lane, Round Bush (serving Aldenham) in 1865, lasting until the 1930s.
Clore Shalom School and Hertsmere Jewish Primary School are the only Jewish faith primary schools in Hertfordshire, and are feeders for Yavneh College in Borehamwood.
Potters Bar.
The first National School to serve Potters Bar was erected on Barnet Road between St. Vincent's Way and Hill Rise, in October 1839.
It was replaced in 1872 by St John's School, which lasted until 1954.
A new infants' school was built on the High Street in August 1861 by Rev. H.G. Watkins on his own land, and took over the infants from the national school.
The building still stands, and is Grade II listed.
It housed an expanded senior school from 1833 to 1938, after which it became an infant and junior school, renamed Ladbrooke School after the farm to the West of the High Street that had just been replaced by a housing estate.
In April 1998 the school moved to new buildings on the site of the former Parkfield School (1938–1960).
The new access road to the school was named Watkins Rise in memory of the school's founder.
A former school in the area was Sunnybank Primary School (1960–2007) .

Maria Kalergis

Maria Kalergis (Maria Kalergis-Muchanow, née Maria Nesselrode; Warsaw, 7 August 1822 – 22 May 1874, Warsaw) was a countess, Polish pianist and patron of the arts.
Life.
At the age of seventeen Maria Nesselrode married Jan Kalergis, a rich landowner, who was much older and proved to be of a jealous disposition. Though they had a daughter, Marie, born in 1840 in Saint Petersburg, less than a year after their wedding they mutually decided to separate. Despite several attempts to overcome their aversion for each other, they would continue living separately, without divorcing, until Jan's death. He ensured Maria a prosperous life; to be sure, after their separation the division of their assets was in dispute, but they did allow her to tour Europe, including Saint Petersburg, Warsaw, Paris and Baden-Baden.
The course of Maria's marriage may have been influenced by her childhood experiences. A year after her birth, her father, Fryderyk Karol Nesselrode (of German descent) and his wife Tekla Nałęcz-Górska (of Polish descent), had separated due to personality differences. From her sixth year, Maria had been reared in Saint Petersburg in the home of her paternal uncle, Karl Robert Nesselrode, a Russian diplomat of German descent who for forty years (1816–56) was the Tsar's minister of foreign affairs and who saw to it that Maria received a thorough education.
She may have inherited her musical talent from her parents, and for a while took lessons from Chopin, who praised her talent. She was taught Polish by her mother and also spoke French (then the language of Polish salons), German, English, Italian and Russian.
She is remembered as the great love of Cyprian Norwid. For her, the acquaintance with the young poet was but one of many episodes in an active social life. He, shy and deferential, withdrew into the shade of the beautiful Maria's other admirers. For many years he harbored feelings for her that more than once served him as a source of poetic inspiration. He confided his feelings in letters to Maria Trembicka (General Stanisław Tręmbicki's daughter who later married a man named Faleński), a close friend of the "white siren." Encouraged by his confidante's friendship, he proposed to Maria Kalergis but was not accepted.
From 1847 she lived in Paris, then from 1857 in Warsaw. Guests at her salons included Liszt, Richard Wagner (who addressed his infamous essay "Das Judentum in der Musik" to her), de Musset, Moniuszko, Gautier, Heine (who dedicated his poem "The White Elephant" to her) and Chopin. Back in Warsaw she became a patroness of the arts and took part in charity fund-raising concerts and theatrical performances. Her resources were always available to those in need.
When Stanisław Moniuszko wanted to premiere the four-act version of his opera "Halka" in Warsaw, he was opposed by the director of the Warsaw government theaters, Siergiej Muchanow (who was also the Warsaw chief of police and in 1863 would become Maria's second husband). Thanks to Maria's intervention, Moniuszko managed to get the opera put on. Three months after the January 1858 opening, she organized a concert to benefit Moniuszko, who was having financial difficulties. The concert raised 25,000 Polish "złotych", which enabled the composer to meet his basic needs and take a journey abroad.
Maria Kalergis had an appreciable influence on the development of musical culture, helping found the Warsaw Musical Institute (now the Warsaw Conservatory) and founding with Moniuszko the Warsaw Musical Society, now the Warsaw Philharmonic. In 1857–71 she frequently appeared as a pianist.
Soon after her husband's death in 1863, she married Siergiej Muchanow, ten years her junior. He was with her during her illness and nursed her devotedly through her final days. It was probably then that, sensing the approaching end of her life, Maria destroyed her correspondence. Her letters to her daughter, son-in-law and friends have survived, however, and have made it possible to reconstruct many facts about her life and are a valuable source of knowledge about the period. She was interred at Warsaw's Powązki Cemetery. On her death, Liszt wrote his "Elegy on Marie Kalergi".
Descendants.
Maria Kalergis' grandson, Jan Henryk Maria Count Coudenhove, with Emperor Franz Josef's permission, changed his surname to Coudenhove-Calergi. He married a Japanese lady, Mitsuko Aoyama. Their son, Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, in 1923 founded the Paneuropean Union.

<doc id="21491509" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21491509" title="The Inconvenience Committee">
The Inconvenience Committee

The Inconvenience Committee is a pressure group founded in 2005 by London professional Blue Badge tourist guides, with a view to influencing local councils within London to provide more, free, clean, attended public conveniences.
The Inconvenience Committee was established by British Blue Badge guides from both professional guiding organisations - the Guild of Registered Tourist Guides (GRTG) and the union affiliated Association of Professional Tourist Guides (APTG). The Committee came into being as a direct response to Westminster City Council privatising the public lavatories around Parliament Square, a World Heritage Site and popular first stop for tourists visiting London.
The Committee argued that tourists are often elderly, often have not had a chance to obtain British coinage and have arrived in London after extended travel by coach from docks or airports.
The Committee has also consistently encouraged Westminster Council to open more public conveniences - the Council claims to have more WCs than any other London district - but is hamstrung by the simple fact that Westminster sees little income from business rates. The Inconvenience Committee sees a larger fight with getting the Government to recognise the true cost of tourism services.
Although unsuccessful in reversing the Council's decision to privatise the Parliament Square loos, the Committee claims some credit for the Council's decision to open a free public facility at Oxford Circus and in discouraging the City of London from privatising more WCs within the jurisdiction of the Corporation of London.
The Inconvenience Committee has argued that the provision of free, plentiful and attended WCs and washrooms, is a major deterrent to the spread of pandemics, a threat to which London as a global crossroads and destination city, is particularly vulnerable. As such the Committee's philosophy echoes that of Professor Clara Greed, lecturer in planned urban environments at Bristol University, who seeks to place WCs and washing facilities at the heart of urban environments as a way of revitalising run-down and 'unwelcoming' city centres.
Recently the Committee's initiative has suffered a setback with the publication of a Government Select Committee report on public toilets, which supported a policy already in place in a few London boroughs of encouraging fast food providers and cafes to open their WCs to the passing public: obviously not a feasible policy for crowded and much visited areas, large groups or the very poor or homeless. 
The Inconvenience Committee is made up of GTRG members Eileen Cox, Alison Bennett and APTG members Dr Ros Stanwell-Smith, Hugh Dickson,

Gliding

Gliding is a recreational activity and competitive air sport in which pilots fly unpowered aircraft known as gliders or sailplanes using naturally occurring currents of rising air in the atmosphere to remain airborne. The word "soaring" is also used for the sport.
Gliding as a sport began in the 1920s. Initially the objective was to increase the duration of flights but soon pilots attempted cross-country flights away from the place of launch. Improvements in aerodynamics and in the understanding of weather phenomena have allowed greater distances at higher average speeds. Long distances are now flown using any of the main sources of rising air: ridge lift, thermals and lee waves. When conditions are favorable, experienced pilots can now fly hundreds of kilometres before returning to their home airfields; occasionally flights of more than are achieved.
Some competitive pilots fly in races around pre-defined courses. These gliding competitions test pilots' abilities to make best use of local weather conditions as well as their flying skills. Local and national competitions are organized in many countries, and there are biennial World Gliding Championships.
Techniques to maximize a glider's speed around the day's task in a competition have been developed, including the optimum speed to fly, navigation using GPS and the carrying of water ballast. If the weather deteriorates pilots are sometimes unable to complete a cross-country flight. Consequently they may need to land elsewhere, perhaps in a field, but motorglider pilots can avoid this by starting an engine.
Powered-aircraft and winches are the two most common means of launching gliders. These and other launch methods require assistance and facilities such as airfields, tugs, and winches. These are usually provided by gliding clubs who also train new pilots and maintain high safety standards.
Although in most countries the standards of safety of the pilots and the aircraft are the responsibility of governmental bodies, the clubs and sometimes national gliding associations often have delegated authority.
The sport is facing challenges to maintain its popularity. Many factors have put pressure on the movement such as the increasing demands on people's time, cost of insurance and fuel, competition from other air sports and the growing requirement for land and controlled airspace.
History.
The development of heavier-than-air flight in the half century between Sir George Cayley's coachman in 1853 and the Wright brothers mainly involved gliders (see Aviation history). However, the sport of gliding only emerged after the First World War, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed severe restrictions on the manufacture and use of single-seat powered aircraft in Germany's Weimar Republic. Thus, in the 1920s and 1930s, while aviators and aircraft makers in the rest of the world were working to improve the performance of powered aircraft, the Germans were designing, developing and flying ever more efficient gliders and discovering ways of using the natural forces in the atmosphere to make them fly farther and faster. With the active support of the German government, there were 50,000 glider pilots by 1937.
The first German gliding competition was held at the Wasserkuppe in 1920, organized by Oskar Ursinus. The best flight lasted two minutes and set a world distance record of . Within ten years, it had become an international event in which the achieved durations and distances had increased greatly. In 1931, Gunther Grönhoff flew on the front of a storm from Munich to Kadaň (Kaaden in German) in Western Czechoslovakia, farther than had been thought possible.
In the 1930s, gliding spread to many other countries. In the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin gliding was a demonstration sport, and it was scheduled to be a full Olympic sport in the 1940 Games. A glider, the Olympia, was developed in Germany for the event, but World War II intervened. By 1939 the major gliding records were held by Russians, including a distance record of . During the war, the sport of gliding in Europe was largely suspended, though several German fighter aces in the conflict, including Erich Hartmann, began their flight training in gliders. 
Gliding did not return to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a shortage of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (Some in the community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.
In many countries during the 1950s a large number of trained pilots wanted to continue flying. Many were also aeronautical engineers who could design, build and maintain gliders. They started both clubs and manufacturers, many of which still exist. This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders, for example the membership of the Soaring Society of America increased from 1,000 to 16,000 by 1980. The increased numbers of pilots, greater knowledge and improving technology helped set new records, for example the pre-war altitude record was doubled by 1950, and the first flight was achieved in 1964.
New materials such as glass fiber and carbon fiber, advances in wing shapes and airfoils, electronic instruments, the Global Positioning System and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary. Today over 550 pilots have made flights over .
Although there is no Olympic competition, there are the World Gliding Championships. The first event was held at the Samedan in 1948. Since World War II it has been held every two years. There are now six classes open to both sexes, plus three classes for women and two junior classes. The latest worldwide statistics for 2011 indicate that Germany, the sport's birthplace, is still a center of the gliding world: it accounted for 27 percent of the world's glider pilots, and the three major glider manufacturers are still based there. However the meteorological conditions that allow soaring are common and the sport has been taken up in many countries. At the last count there were over 111,000 active civilian glider pilots and 32,920 gliders, plus an unknown number of military cadets and aircraft. Clubs actively seek new members by giving trial flights, which are also a useful source of revenue for them.
Soaring.
Glider pilots can stay airborne for hours by flying through air that is ascending as fast or faster than the glider itself is descending, thus gaining potential energy.
The most commonly used sources of rising air are
Ridge lift rarely allows pilots to climb much higher than about above the terrain; thermals, depending on the climate and terrain, can allow climbs in excess of in flat country and much higher above mountains; wave lift has allowed a glider to reach an altitude of .
In a few countries such as the UK, gliders may continue to climb into the clouds in uncontrolled airspace,
but in many European countries the pilot must stop climbing before reaching the cloud base (see Visual Flight Rules).
Thermals.
Thermals are streams of rising air that are formed on the ground through the warming of the surface by sunlight. If the air contains enough moisture, the water will condense from the rising air and form cumulus clouds.
When the air has little moisture or when an inversion stops the warm air from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or dust devils to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals can be found in the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires. 
Once a thermal is encountered, the pilot can fly in tight circles to keep the glider within the thermal, so gaining altitude before flying towards the destination or to the next thermal. This is known as "thermalling". Alternatively, glider pilots on cross-country flights may choose to 'dolphin'. This is when the pilot merely slows down in rising air, and then speeds up again in the non-rising air, thus following an undulating flight path. Dolphining allows the pilot to minimize the loss of height over great distances without spending time turning. Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common and can be maximized by gliders equipped with flaps. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating cloud streets. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.
As it requires rising heated air, thermalling is most effective in mid-latitudes from spring through late summer. During winter the sun's heat can only create weak thermals, but ridge and wave lift can still be used during this period.
Ridge lift.
A ridge soaring pilot uses upward air movements caused when the wind blows on to the sides of hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.
Wave lift.
The powerfully rising and sinking air in mountain waves was discovered by glider pilot, Wolf Hirth, in 1933. Gliders can sometimes climb in these waves to great altitudes, although pilots must use supplementary oxygen to avoid hypoxia.
This lift is often marked by long, stationary lenticular (lens-shaped) clouds lying perpendicular to the wind. Mountain wave was used to set the current altitude record of on 29 August 2006 over El Calafate, Argentina. The pilots, Steve Fossett and Einar Enevoldson, wore pressure suits. The current world distance record of by Klaus Ohlmann (set on 21 January 2003) was also flown using mountain waves in South America.
A rare wave phenomenon is known as Morning Glory, a roll cloud producing strong lift. Pilots near Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria make use of it in springtime.
Other sources of lift.
The boundaries where two air masses meet are known as convergence zones.
These can occur in sea breezes or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary between two masses of air like a shallow cold front. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection as if it were a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.
Glider pilots have occasionally been able to use a technique called "dynamic soaring" allowing a glider to gain kinetic energy by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of different horizontal velocity. However, such zones of high "wind gradient" are usually too close to the ground to be used safely by gliders.
Launch methods.
Most gliders do not have engines or at least engines that would allow a take-off under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice for the type of launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.
Aerotowing.
In an aerotow a powered plane is attached to the glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.
During the aerotow, the glider pilot keeps the glider behind the tow-plane in either the "low tow" position, just below the wake from the tow-plane, or the "high tow" position just above the wake. In Australia the convention is to fly in low tow, whereas in the United States and Europe the high tow prevails. One rare aerotow variation is attaching two gliders to one tow-plane, using a short rope for the high-towed glider and a long rope for the low tow. The current record is nine gliders in the same aerotow.
Winch launching.
Gliders are often launched using a stationary ground-based winch mounted on a heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often in addition to an aerotow service. The engine is usually a large diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 1,600-metre (3,000 to 5,500 ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 400 to 700 metres (1,300 to 2,200 ft) after a short, steep ride.
Winch launches are much cheaper than aerotows and have the advantage that many members of a club can be taught to operate the equipment. A winch may also be used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of the shape of the field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.
Auto-tow.
Another method of launching, the "autotow", is rarer nowadays. The direct autotow requires a hard surface and a powerful vehicle that is attached to the glider by a long steel cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver accelerates hard and as a result the glider rises rapidly to about 400 metres (1,300 ft), especially if there is a good headwind and a runway of or more. This method has also been used on desert dry lakes.
A variation on the direct autotow is known as the "reverse pulley" method. In this method, the truck drives towards the glider being launched. The cable passes around a pulley at the far end of the airfield, resulting in an effect similar to that of a winch launch.
Bungee launch.
Bungee launching was widely used in the early days of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a strong breeze using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or "bungee". For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.
Cross-country.
One of the measures of a glider's performance is the distance that it can fly for each meter it descends, known as its glide ratio. Depending on the class, this can range in modern designs from 44:1 in the Standard Class up to 70:1 for the largest aircraft. A good gliding performance combined with regular sources of rising air enables modern gliders to fly long distances at high speeds. The weather is a major factor in determining cross-country speeds. The record average speed for is . required unusually good conditions, but even in places with less favorable conditions (such as Northern Europe) a skilled pilot could expect to complete flights over every year.
As the performance of gliders improved in the 1960s, the concept of flying as far away as possible became unpopular with the crews who had to retrieve the gliders. Pilots now usually plan to fly around a course (called a "task") via turn-points, returning to the starting point.
In addition to just trying to fly further, glider pilots also race each other in competitions. The winner is the fastest, or, if the weather conditions are poor, the furthest round the course. Tasks of up to 1,000 km have been set and average speeds of 120 km/h are not unusual.
Initially, ground observers confirmed that pilots had rounded the turn-points. Later, the glider pilots photographed these places and submitted the film for verification. Today, gliders carry secure GNSS Flight Recorders that record the position every few seconds from GPS satellites. These recording devices now provide the proof that the turn-points have been reached.
National competitions generally last one week, with international championships running over two. The winner is the pilot who has amassed the greatest number of points over all the contest days. However, these competitions have as yet failed to draw much interest outside the gliding community for several reasons. Because it would be unsafe for many gliders to cross a start line at the same time, pilots can choose their own start time. Furthermore, gliders are not visible to the spectators for long periods during each day's contest and the scoring is complex, so traditional gliding competitions are difficult to televise. In an attempt to widen the sport's appeal, a new format, the Grand Prix, has been introduced. Innovations introduced in the Grand Prix format include simultaneous starts for a small number of gliders, cockpit mounted cameras, telemetry giving the positions of the gliders, tasks consisting of multiple circuits, and simplified scoring.
There is a decentralized Internet-based competition called the Online Contest, in which pilots upload their GPS data files and are automatically scored based on distance flown. Worldwide, 6,703 pilots registered for this contest in 2010.
Maximizing average speed.
Soaring pioneer Paul MacCready is usually credited with developing mathematical principles for optimizing the speed at which to fly when cross-country soaring, although it was first described by Wolfgang Späte in 1938. The speed to fly theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a "McCready ring", a rotatable bezel on the glider's variometer to indicate the best speed to fly. The greatest factor in maximizing average speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.
On cross-country flights on days when strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.
On days with particularly strong and widespread lift pilots can attain high average speeds by alternating periods of fast flight with pull-ups, merely slowing down in areas of lift without deviating from the course. This 'dolphining' technique can result in high average speeds because the height lost can be minimised until particularly strong lift is encountered when circling would be most effective.
Badges.
Achievements in gliding have been marked by the awarding of badges since the 1920s. For the lower badges, such as the first solo flight, national gliding federations set their own criteria. Typically, a bronze badge shows preparation for cross-country flight, including precise landings and witnessed soaring flights. Higher badges follow the standards set down by the Gliding Commission of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).
The FAI's Sporting Code defines the rules for observers and recording devices to validate the claims for badges that are defined by kilometers of distance and meters of altitude gained.
The Silver-C badge was introduced in 1930. Earning the Silver Badge shows that a glider pilot has achieved an altitude gain of at least , made a five-hour duration flight, and has flown cross-country for a straight-line distance of at least : these three attainments are usually, but not invariably, achieved in separate flights. The Gold and Diamond Badges require pilots to fly higher and further. A pilot who has completed the three parts of the Diamond Badge has flown to a pre-defined goal, has flown in one flight (but not necessarily to a pre-defined goal) and gained in height. The FAI also issues a diploma for a flight of and further diplomas for increments of .
Landing out.
If lift is not found during a cross-country flight, for example because of deteriorating weather, the pilot must choose a location to "land out". Although inconvenient and often mistaken for "emergency landings", landing out (or "outlanding") is a routine event in cross-country gliding. The pilot has to choose a location where the glider can be landed safely, without damaging the plane, the pilot, or property such as crops or livestock. The glider and the pilot(s) can then be retrieved by road from the outlanding location using a purpose-built trailer. In some instances, a tow-plane can be summoned to re-launch the aircraft.
Use of engines or motors.
Although adding to the weight and expense, some gliders are fitted with small power units and are known as motor gliders. This avoids the inconvenience of landing out. The power units can be internal combustion engines, electrical motors, or retractable jet engines. Retractable propellers are fitted to high performance sailplanes, though in another category, called touring motor gliders, non-retractable propellers are used. Some powered gliders are "self launching", which makes the glider independent of a tow plane. However some gliders have "sustainer" engines that can prolong flight but are not powerful enough for launching. All power units have to be started at a height that includes a margin that would still allow a safe landing out to be made, if there were a failure to start.
In a competition, using the engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, as they do not need a safety margin for starting the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.
Aerobatic competitions.
World and European Aerobatic competitions are held regularly. In this type of competition, the pilots fly a program of maneuvers (such as inverted flight, loop, roll, and various combinations). Each maneuver has a rating called the "K-Factor". Maximum points are given for the maneuver if it is flown perfectly; otherwise, points are deducted. Efficient maneuvers also enable the whole program to be completed with the height available. The winner is the pilot with the most points.
Hazards.
Unlike hang gliders and paragliders, gliders surround the pilots with strong structures and have undercarriages to absorb impacts when landing. These features prevent injuries from otherwise minor incidents,
Training and regulation.
In addition to national laws controlling aviation, the sport in many countries is regulated though national gliding associations and then through local gliding clubs. Much of the regulation concerns safety and training.
Many clubs provide training for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically from the back seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until the student is deemed to have the skill and the airmanship necessary to fly solo. Simulators are also beginning to be used in training, especially during poor weather.
After the first solo flights glider pilots are required to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.
In addition to the regulation of pilots, gliders are inspected annually and after exceeding predetermined flight times. Maximum and minimum payloads are also defined for each glider. Because most gliders are designed to the same specifications of safety, the upper weight limit for a pilot, after allowing for a parachute, is usually . There is also a limit, 193 centimetres (6 ft 4 in), on the tallest pilots who can safely fit into a typical glider's cockpit.
Challenges for the gliding movement.
According to the FAI President, gliding as a sport faces challenges in the years ahead. These include:
Related air sports.
The two air sports that are most closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are significant differences which are listed in detail in . The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated hang-gliders is becoming less distinct. For example hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.

United States presidential election

The election of the President and the Vice President of the United States is an indirect vote in which citizens cast ballots for a slate of members of the U.S. Electoral College; these electors in turn directly elect the President and Vice President. Presidential elections occur quadrennially (the count beginning with the year 1792) on Election Day, the Tuesday between November 2 and 8, coinciding with the general elections of various other federal, states and local races. The most recent was the 2012 election, held on November 6. The next election will be the 2016 election, which will be held on November 8, 2016.
The process is regulated by a combination of both federal and state laws. Each state is allocated a number of Electoral College electors equal to the number of its Senators and Representatives in the U.S. Congress. Additionally, Washington, D.C. is given a number of electors equal to the number held by the smallest state. U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College.
Under the U.S. Constitution, each state legislature is allowed to designate a way of choosing electors. Thus, the popular vote on Election Day is conducted by the various states and not directly by the federal government. Once chosen, the electors can vote for anyone, but – with rare exceptions like an unpledged elector or faithless elector – they vote for their designated candidates and their votes are certified by Congress, who is the final judge of electors, in early January.
The nomination process, including the primary elections and the nominating conventions, was never specified in the Constitution, and was instead developed by the states and the political parties. This too is also an indirect election process, where voters cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee.
History.
Article Two of the United States Constitution originally established the method of presidential elections, including the Electoral College. This was a result of a compromise between those constitutional framers who wanted the Congress to choose the president, and those who preferred a national popular vote.
Each state is allocated a number of electors that is equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of Congress combined. With the ratification of the 23rd Amendment to the Constitution in 1969, the District of Columbia is also granted a number of electors, equal to the number of those held by the least populous state. However, U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College.
Constitutionally, the manner for choosing electors is determined within each state by its legislature. During the first presidential election in 1789, only 6 of the 13 original states chose electors by any form of popular vote. Gradually throughout the years, the states began conducting popular elections to help choose their slate of electors, resulting in the overall, nationwide indirect election system that it is today.
Under the original system established by Article Two, electors could cast two votes to two different candidates for president. The candidate with the highest number of votes (provided it was a majority of the electoral votes) became the president, and the second-place candidate became the vice president. This presented a problem during the presidential election of 1800 when Aaron Burr received the same number of electoral votes as Thomas Jefferson and challenged Jefferson's election to the office. In the end, Jefferson was chosen as the president because of Alexander Hamilton's influence in the House of Representatives. This added to the deep rivalry between Burr and Hamilton which resulted in their famous 1804 duel.
In response to the 1800 election, the 12th Amendment was passed, requiring electors to cast two distinct votes: one for President and another for Vice President. The Amendment also established rules when no candidate wins a majority vote in the Electoral College.
In the presidential election of 1824, Andrew Jackson received a plurality, but not a majority, of electoral votes cast. The election was thrown to the House of Representatives, and John Quincy Adams was elected to the presidency. A deep rivalry was fermented between Andrew Jackson and House Speaker Henry Clay, who had also been a candidate in the election.
Although the nationwide popular vote does not directly determine the winner of a presidential election, it does strongly correlate with who is the victor. In 52 of the 56 total elections held so far (about 93 percent), the winner of the Electoral College vote has also carried the national popular vote. However, candidates can fail to get the most votes in the nationwide popular vote in a Presidential election and still win that election. In the 1824 election, Jackson won the popular vote, but no one received the majority of electoral votes. According to the 12th Amendment in the Constitution, the House of Representatives must choose the president out of the top 3 people in the election. Clay had come fourth, so he threw his support to Adams, who then won. Because Adams later named Clay his Secretary of State, Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams gained the presidency by making a deal with Clay. Charges of a "corrupt bargain" followed Adams through his term. Then in 1876, 1888 and 2000, the winner of electoral vote lost the popular vote outright. Numerous constitutional amendments have been submitted seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, but none has ever successfully passed both Houses of Congress. Another alternate proposal is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an interstate compact whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective statewide results.
The presidential election day was established on a Tuesday in the month of November because of the factors involved (weather, harvests and worship). When voters used to travel to the polls by horse, Tuesday was an ideal day because it allowed people to worship on Sunday, ride to their county seat on Monday, and vote on Tuesday–all before market day, Wednesday. The month of November also fit nicely between harvest time and harsh winter weather, which could be especially bad to people traveling by horse and buggy.
Until 1937, presidents were not sworn in until March 4 because it took so long to count and report ballots, and because of the winner's logistical issues of moving to the capital. With better technology and the 20th Amendment being passed, presidential inaugurations were moved to noon on January 20–allowing presidents to start their duties sooner.
Procedure.
Nominating process.
The modern nominating process of U.S. presidential elections currently consists of two major parts: a series of presidential primary elections and caucuses held in each state, and the presidential nominating conventions held by each political party. This process was never included in the United States Constitution, and thus evolved over time by the political parties to clear the field of candidates.
The primary elections are run by state and local governments, while the caucuses are organized directly by the political parties. Some states hold only primary elections, some hold only caucuses, and others use a combination of both. These primaries and caucuses are staggered between January and June before the federal election, with Iowa and New Hampshire traditionally holding the first presidential state caucus and primary, respectively.
Like the general election, presidential caucuses or primaries are indirect elections. The major political parties officially vote for their presidential candidate at their respective nominating conventions, usually all held in the summer before the federal election. Depending on each state's law and state's political party rules, when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary, they may be voting to award delegates "bound" to vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating conventions, or they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not bound to follow in selecting delegates to their respective national convention.
Unlike the general election, voters in the U.S. territories can also elect delegates to the national conventions.
Along with delegates chosen during primaries and caucuses, state delegations to both the Democratic and Republican conventions also include "unpledged" delegates who can vote for whomever they want. For Republicans, these include top party officials. Democrats have a more expansive group of unpledged delegates called "superdelegates", who are party leaders and elected officials.
Each party's presidential candidate also chooses a vice presidential nominee to run with them on the same ticket, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention.
The popular vote on Election Day.
Under the United States Constitution, the manner of choosing electors for the Electoral College is determined by each state's legislature. Although each state currently designates electors by popular vote, other methods are allowed. For instance, a number of states formerly chose presidential electors by a vote of the state legislature itself.
However, federal law does specify that all electors must be selected on the same day, which is "the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November," i.e. a Tuesday no earlier than November 2 and no later than November 8. Today, the states and the District of Columbia each conduct their own popular elections on Election Day to help determine their respective slate of electors. Thus, the presidential election is really an amalgamation of separate and simultaneous state elections instead of a single national election run by the federal government.
Like any other election in the United States, the eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the Constitution and regulated at state level. The Constitution states that suffrage cannot be denied on grounds of race or color, sex or age for citizens eighteen years or older. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility.
Generally, voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of their choice. The presidential ballot is a vote "for the electors of a candidate" meaning that the voter is not voting for the candidate, but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a specific Presidential and Vice Presidential candidate.
Many voting ballots allow a voter to “blanket vote” for all candidates in a particular political party or to select individual candidates on a line by line voting system. Which candidates appear on the voting ticket is determined through a legal process known as ballot access. Usually, the size of the candidate's political party and the results of the major nomination conventions determine who is pre-listed on the presidential ballot. Thus, the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate running for President, but only those who have secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party warrants having been formally listed. Laws are in effect to have other candidates pre-listed on a ticket, provided that enough voters have endorsed the candidate, usually through a signature list.
The final way to be elected for president is to have one's name written in at the time of election as a write-in candidate. This is used for candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be pre-listed on the voting ticket. It is also used by voters to express a distaste for the listed candidates, by writing in an alternative candidate for president such as Mickey Mouse or comedian Stephen Colbert (whose application was voted down by the South Carolina Democratic Party). In any event, a write-in candidate has never won an election for President of the United States.
Because U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College, U.S. citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for President. Guam has held straw polls for president since the 1980 election to draw attention to this fact.
Electoral college.
Most state laws establish a winner-take-all system, wherein the ticket that wins a plurality of votes wins all of that state's allocated electoral votes, and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College. Maine and Nebraska do not use this method, opting instead to give two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district.
Each state's winning slate of electors then meets at their respective state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for President and Vice President. Although Electoral College members can technically vote for anyone under the U.S. Constitution, 24 states have laws to punish faithless electors, those who do not cast their electoral votes for the person whom they have pledged to elect.
In early January, the total Electoral College vote count is opened by the sitting Vice President, acting in his capacity as President of the Senate, and read aloud to a joint session of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time as the President.
If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote (currently at least 270), the President is determined by the rules outlined by the 12th Amendment. Specifically, the selection of President would then be decided by a ballot of the House of Representatives. For the purposes of electing the President, each state has only one vote. A ballot of the Senate is held to choose the Vice President. In this ballot, each senator has one vote. The House of Representatives has chosen the victor of the presidential race only twice, in 1800 and 1824; the Senate has chosen the victor of the vice-presidential race only once, in 1836.
If the President is not chosen by Inauguration Day, the Vice President-elect acts as President. If neither are chosen by then, Congress by law determines who shall act as President, pursuant to the 20th Amendment.
Unless there are faithless electors, disputes, or other controversies, the events in December and January mentioned above are largely a formality since the winner can be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote results. Between the general election and Inauguration Day, this apparent winner is referred to as the "President-elect" (unless it is a sitting President that has won re-election).
Election calendar.
The entire presidential campaign and election process usually takes almost two years. The typical periods of this process are as follows:
Trends.
Political experience.
A number of trends in the political experience of presidents have been observed over the years. In recent decades, the presidential nominees of the Democratic and Republican parties have been either incumbent presidents, sitting or former vice presidents, sitting or former U.S. Senators, or sitting or former state Governors. The last major nominee from either party who had not previously served in such an office was General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who won the Republican nomination and ultimately the presidency in the 1952 election. Chester A. Arthur had held no federal or statewide office, before becoming Vice President and then President following the assassination of President James A. Garfield in 1881.
The U.S. Secretary of State used to be a stepping-stone to the White House, with five of the six Presidents who served between 1801 and 1841 previously holding that office. However, since 1841, only one Secretary of State has gone on to be President (James Buchanan).
Fourteen Presidents have previously served as Vice President. However only John Adams (1796), Thomas Jefferson (1800), Martin Van Buren (1836), Richard Nixon (1968) and George H. W. Bush (1988) began their first term after winning an election. Among the remaining nine who began their first term as President according to the presidential line of succession after their respective predecessor died or resigned from office, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson were reelected. John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A. Arthur, and Gerald Ford served as President but never won any presidential election. Ford had been appointed to the Vice Presidency through the processes of the Twenty-fifth Amendment and lost the 1976 presidential election, making him the only President to have never been elected to national office.
In the 2008 election, the nominees of both major parties, Barack Obama and John McCain, were sitting U.S. Senators. Before 2008, fifteen presidents previously served in the Senate, including four of the five Presidents who served between 1945 and 1974. However, only two out of those fifteen were sitting U.S. Senators at the time they were elected president (Warren G. Harding in 1920 and John F. Kennedy in 1960). Major-party candidate Senators Andrew Jackson (1824), Lewis Cass (1848), Stephen Douglas (1860), Barry Goldwater (1964), George McGovern (1972), and John Kerry (2004) all lost their elections. Only one sitting member of the House of Representatives has been elected president (James A. Garfield in 1880), although eighteen presidents have been former members of the House.
Despite Obama's tenure, contemporary electoral success has clearly favored state governors. Of the last six presidents, four (Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush) have been governors of a state. Geographically, these presidents were from either very large states (California, Texas) or from a state south of the Mason-Dixon Line and east of Texas (Georgia, Arkansas). In all, sixteen presidents have been former governors, including seven who were in office as governor at the time of their election to the presidency. Other major-party candidates who were also state governors include Michael Dukakis (1988), and Mitt Romney (2012).
After leaving office, one President, William Howard Taft, served as Chief Justice of the United States. Only two Presidents, John Quincy Adams (serving in the House) and Andrew Johnson (serving in the Senate), have served in Congress after being President. John Quincy Adams however is the only former President to be elected to federal office; when Andrew Johnson served as a Senator, state legislatures appointed the Senators.
Technology and media.
Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns. The invention of both radio and television have given way to the reliance of national political advertisements across those methods of communication. National advertisements such as Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 commercial "Daisy", Ronald Reagan's 1984 commercial "Morning in America", and George H.W. Bush's 1988 commercial "Revolving Door" became major factors in those respective elections. In 1992, George H. W. Bush's broken promise of "" was extensively used in the commercials of Bill Clinton and Bush's other opponents with significant effect during the campaign.
Since the development of the Internet in the mid-90s, Internet activism has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, especially since 2000. The internet was first used in the 1996 presidential elections, but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online. It was only used by a few candidates and there is no evidence of any major effect on the outcomes of that election cycle.
In 2000, both candidates (George W. Bush and Al Gore) created, maintained and updated their campaign website. But it was not until the 2004 presidential election cycle was the potential value of the internet seen. By the summer of 2003, ten people competing in the 2004 presidential election had developed campaign websites. Howard Dean’s campaign website from that year was considered a model for all future campaign websites. His website played a significant role in his overall campaign strategy. It allowed his supporters to read about his campaign platform and provide feedback, donate, get involved with the campaign, and connect with other supporters. A Gallup poll from January 2004 revealed that 49 percent of Americans have used the internet to get information about candidates, and 28 percent said that they use the internet to get this information frequently.
In 2008, the internet became a grassroots and a voice of the people tool-a way for the users to connect with each other and with the campaign, like Dean’s website had done in 2004. All of the major candidates had a website and utilized social networking like facebook and myspace. The popularity of a candidate could be measured by the number of ‘friends’ on these sites as well as on websites like Hitwise, which listed the number of hits all of the presidential candidate’s websites had each week.
Internet channels such as YouTube were used by candidates to share speeches and ads for free. This also served as a forum for users to attack other candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.
A study done by the Pew Internet & American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54 percent of adults in the United States used the internet to get information about the 2010 midterm elections and about specific candidates. This represents 73 percent of adult internet users. The study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used social network sites or Twitter to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns.
E-campaigning as it has come to be called, is subject to very little regulation. On March 26, 2006 the Federal Election Commission voted unanimously to “not regulate political communication on the Internet, including emails, blogs and the creating of Web sites” This decision made only paid political ads placed on websites subject to campaign finance limitations. A comment was made about this decision by Roger Alan Stone of Advocacy Inc. that explain this loophole in the context of a political campaign, "A wealthy individual could purchase all of the e-mail addresses for registered voters in a congressional district . . . produce an Internet video ad, and e-mail it along with a link to the campaign contribution page..Not only would this activity not count against any contribution limits or independent expenditure requirements; it would never even need to be reported”
Criticisms.
Today, major parts of the presidential election process remain controversial. Because of the staggered nature of the primary season, voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other small states which traditionally hold their primaries and caucuses first in January usually have a major impact on the races. Conversely, voters in California and other large states which traditionally hold their primaries last in June usually have no say because the races are usually over by then. As a result, more states vie for earlier primaries to claim a greater influence in the process. Primary and caucus reform proposals include a National Primary held on a single day; or the Interregional Primary Plan, where states would be grouped into six regions, and each of the regions would rotate every election on who would hold their primaries first.
With the primary races usually over before June, the political conventions have mostly become scripted, ceremonial affairs. As the drama has left the conventions, and complaints grown that they were scripted and dull pep rallies, viewership has fallen off. After formerly offering gavel-to-gavel coverage of the major party conventions in the mid-20th Century, the Big Three television networks now only devote approximately three hours of coverage (one hour per night).
Critics argue that the Electoral College is archaic and inherently undemocratic. With most states using a winner-take-all system, both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party candidates are all but certain to win all the electoral votes from the predominately Democratic and Republican states, respectively. This gives certain swing states, states in which no single candidate or party has overwhelming support, disproportionate influence. Thus, presidential candidates usually spend exponentially more time, money, and energy campaigning in a historically swing state like Ohio than either a Democratic state like California or a Republican state like Texas. Furthermore, a candidate can win the electoral vote without securing the greatest amount of the popular vote, such as during the 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000 elections. Proposed reforms include the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an interstate compact whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective statewide results.
Electoral college results.
The following is a table of electoral college results:
Voter turnout.
Voter turnout in the 2004 and 2008 elections showed a noticeable increase over the turnout in 1996 and 2000. Prior to 2004, voter turnout in presidential elections had been decreasing while voter registration, measured in terms of voting age population (VAP) by the U.S. Census, has been increasing. The VAP figure, however, includes persons ineligible to vote — mainly non-citizens and ineligible felons — and excludes overseas eligible voters. Opinion is mixed on whether this decline was due to voter apathy [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/voting/013995.html] or an increase in ineligible voters on the rolls.
The difference between these two measures are illustrated by analysis of turnout in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Voter turnout from the 2004 and 2008 election was "not statistically different," based on the voting age population used by a November 2008 U.S. Census survey of 50,000 households [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/voting/013995.html]. If expressed in terms of vote eligible population (VEP), the 2008 national turnout rate was 61.7% from 131.3 million ballots cast for president, an increase of over 1.6 percentage points over the 60.1% turnout rate of 2004, and the highest since 1968.
Financial disclosures.
Prior to 1967, many presidential candidates disclosed assets, stock holdings, and other information which might affect the public trust. In that year, Republican candidate George W. Romney went a step further and released his tax returns for the previous twelve years. Since then, many presidential candidates – including all major-party nominees since 1980 – have released some of their returns, although few of the major party nominees have equaled or exceeded George Romney's twelve.
Presidential coattails.
Presidential elections are held on the same date as those for all the seats in the United States House of Representatives, the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate, the governorships in several U.S. states, as well as many state and local elections. Presidential candidates tend to bring out supporters who then vote for his party's candidates for those other offices. Members of the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives are also more likely to be voted for on a year of the presidential election than a midterm. In effect, these other candidates are said to ride on his coattails.

Grooves (archaeology)

There are grooves (, ) carved into rock in many places in Europe, and some of them appear on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland. They are common in France, where they were used to polish stone axes.
In Sweden, there are also grooves in north-western Scania and Halland. In Gantofta located 14 km south of Helsingborg a face of sandstone rock is engraved with thousands of grooves. Local tradition says they were made as whetstones.
Grooves in France date from the Neolithic and are called "polissoirs". Those in l’Aube date from c. 2500 to 2000 BCE. People who built dolmens, erected menhirs and made grooves supported an archaeological culture known as Seine-Oise-Marne. The l’Aube district had more than 130 monuments from this period including 49 grooves before 1927. Today there are only 34 including 16 grooves. Many stones were cut into roadstones or building blocks for homes.
Grooves have also been found in Tavastia in Finland and in Luxembourg, as well as at Fyfield Down in England.
Gotland.
3,600 grooves have been discovered on Gotland, of which 700 are in limestone outcrops, while the remainder are on c. 800 boulders and slabs. The grooves are 50–100 cm long, c. 10 cm deep and c. 10 cm wide. The grooves have apparently been made with an abrasive pendulum measuring c. 192–283 cm in length.
The grooves began to attract scholarly attention in the 1850s. At first they were called "sharpening stones", but later they received the name "sword sharpening stones". After some time, newspapers and scholarly publications began to dispute this, since the shape of the grooves make them unfit for sharpening swords. Another reason was the fact that by 1933, more than 500 sites with grooves had been identified on Gotland. They were evenly distributed across the island. It was also noted that they ran in different directions and often crossed each other.
The dates and function of the grooves on Gotland have seen debate in recent decades between archaeologists who argue for a High Medieval date and some industrial function, and proponents of an alternative theory who argue for a Neolithic date and a ritual calendar function. The latter support their view mainly with the idea that the direction of each groove might be given an astronomical interpretation, where each groove would mark a sightline towards a certain celestial phenomenon that may be reconstructed for a certain year during the Stone Age. The grooves under overhangs in Scania cannot have been used as sightlines in this suggested manner.
Certain late 1st millennium picture stones on Gotland carry grooves that have been made after the relief of the stones were carved, which show the grooves to be late. Likewise with the level above current sea surface of the lowest grooved outcrops on the island, that shows them to be no older than AD 1000 judging from post-glacial shoreline displacement. It has been suggested that on one picture stone, part of the Late Iron Age decoration is carved into the bottom of a groove, meaning that this groove must be older than the picture.

Nigersaurus

Nigersaurus (meaning "Niger reptile") is a genus of rebbachisaurid sauropod dinosaur that lived during the middle Cretaceous period, about 115 to 105 million years ago. It was discovered in the Elrhaz Formation in an area called Gadoufaoua, in the Republic of Niger. Fossils of this dinosaur were first described in 1976, but it was only named in 1999 after further and more complete remains were found and described. The genus contains a single species, Nigersaurus taqueti, named after French palaeontologist Philippe Taquet, who discovered the first remains.
"Nigersaurus" was long, which is small for a sauropod, and had a short neck. It weighed around four tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant. Its skeleton was highly pneumatised (filled with air spaces connected to air sacs), but the limbs were robustly built. Its skull was very specialised for feeding, with large fenestrae and thin bones. It had a wide muzzle filled with more than 500 teeth, which were replaced at a rapid rate: around every 14 days. The jaws may have borne a keratinous sheath. Unlike other tetrapods, the tooth-bearing bones of its jaws were rotated transversely relative to the rest of the skull, so that all of its teeth were located far to the front.
The closest relatives of "Nigersaurus" are grouped within the subfamily Nigersaurinae of the family Rebbachisauridae, which is part of the sauropod superfamily Diplodocoidea. "Nigersaurus" was probably a browser, and fed with its head close to the ground. The region of its brain that detected smell was underdeveloped, although its brain size was comparable to that of other dinosaurs. There has been debate on whether its head was habitually held downwards, or horizontally like other sauropods. It lived in a riparian habitat, and its diet probably consisted of soft plants, such as ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms. It is one of the most common fossil vertebrates found in the area, and shared its habitat with other dinosaurian megaherbivores, as well as large theropods and crocodylomorphs.
Description.
Like all sauropods, "Nigersaurus" was a megafaunal quadruped with a small head, thick hind legs, and a prominent tail. Among that clade, "Nigersaurus" was fairly small, with a body length of only and a femur reaching only . It may have weighed around four tonnes, comparable to a modern elephant. It had a short neck for a sauropod, with thirteen cervical vertebrae. Nearly all rebbachisaurids had relatively short necks and a length of or less. The only member of the family that reached the size of larger sauropods was "Rebbachisaurus".
The presacral vertebrae (vertebrae before the sacrum) were heavily pneumatised to the point where the column consisted of a series of hollow "shells", each divided by a thin septum in the middle. It had little to no cancellous bone, making the centra thin bone plates filled with air spaces. The vertebral arches were so heavily pierced by extensions of the external air sacs that of their side walls little remained but thick intersecting laminae, the ridges between the pneumatic openings. The vertebrae of the tail, however, did have solid centra. The pelvic and pectoral girdle bones were very thin also, often only several millimetres thick. Like other sauropods, its limbs were robust, contrasting with the extremely lightweight construction of the rest of the skeleton. The limbs were not as specialised as the rest of the skeleton, and the front legs of "Nigersaurus" were about two-thirds the length of the back legs, as in most diplodocoids.
Skull.
The skull of "Nigersaurus" was delicate, with the four side fenestrae (openings in the skull) larger than in other sauropodomorphs. The total area of bone connecting the muzzle to the back of the skull was only . These connecting struts of bones were usually less than thick. Despite this, the skull was resistant to the sustained shearing of the teeth. Another unique trait it had among sauropodomorphs was a closed supratemporal fenestra. The nasal openings, the bony nostrils, were elongated. Though the nasal bones are not completely known, it appears the front margin of the bony nostril was closer to the snout than in other diplodocoids. The snout was also proportionately shorter, and the tooth row was not at all prognathous, the snout tip not protruding relative to the remainder of the tooth series. The maxillary tooth row was in its entirety transversely rotated, its normal rear 90° everted towards the front. This was matched by an identical rotation of the dentary of the lower jaw. As a result no other tetrapod had all of its teeth located as far to the front as "Nigersaurus".
The slender teeth had slightly curved crowns, which were oval in cross-section. The teeth in the lower jaw may have been 20–30% smaller than those in the upper jaw, but few are known, and they are of uncertain maturity. Apart from this, the teeth were identical. Under each active tooth there was a column of nine replacement teeth within the jaw. With 68 columns in the upper jaws and 60 columns in the lower jaws, these so-called dental batteries (also present in hadrosaurs and certopsians) comprised a total of more than 500 active and replacement teeth. Dental batteries erupted in unison, not each column individually. The enamel on the teeth of "Nigersaurus" was highly asymmetrical, ten times thicker on the outwards facing side than on the inner side. This condition is otherwise known only in advanced ornithischians.
"Nigersaurus" did not exhibit the same modifications seen in the jaws of other dinosaurs with dental batteries, or mammals with elaborate chewing functions. The lower jaw was S-shaped and divided into the subcylindrical transverse ramus, which contained the teeth, and the back ramus, which was more lightweight and was the location for most of the muscle attachments. The jaws also contained several fenestrae, including three that are not present in other sauropods. The front ends of the jaws had grooves that indicate the presence of a keratinous sheath. "Nigersaurus" is the only known tetrapod animal to have had jaws wider than the skull and teeth that extended laterally across the front. The snout was even broader than those of the "duck-billed" hadrosaurs.
History of discovery.
"Nigersaurus" is known from the Elrhaz Formation of the Tegama Group in an area called Gadoufaoua, located in the Republic of Niger. It is one of the most commonly found vertebrates in the formation. Remains thought to belong to "Nigersaurus" were first discovered during a 1965–72 expedition to Niger led by French paleontologist Philippe Taquet, and first mentioned in a paper published in 1976. Although a common genus, the dinosaur had been poorly known until more material of other individuals was discovered during expeditions led by American palaeontologist Paul Sereno in 1997 and 2000. The limited understanding of the genus was the result of poor preservation of its remains, which arises from the delicate and highly pneumatic construction of the skull and skeleton, in turn causing disarticulation of the fossils. Some of the skull fossils were so thin that a strong light beam was visible through them. Therefore, no intact skulls or articulated skeletons have been found, and these specimens represent the most complete known rebbachisaurid remains.
"Nigersaurus" was named and described in more detail by Sereno and colleagues only in 1999, based on remains of newly found individuals. The same article also named "Jobaria", another sauropod from Niger. The genus name "Nigersaurus" ("Niger reptile") is a reference to the country where it was discovered, and the specific name "taqueti" honours Taquet, who was the first to organise large-scale palaeontological expeditions to Niger. The holotype specimen (MNN GAD512) consists of a partial skull and neck. Limb material and a scapula found nearby were also referred to the same specimen. These fossils are housed at the National Museum of Niger.
Sereno and Jeffrey A. Wilson provided the first detailed description of the skull and feeding adaptations in 2005. In 2007, a more detailed description of the skeleton was published, based on a specimen discovered ten years earlier. The fossils, along with a reconstructed skeleton mount and a plastic model of the head and neck, were subsequently presented at the National Geographic Society in Washington. "Nigersaurus" was dubbed a "Mesozoic cow" in the press, and Sereno stressed that it was the most unusual dinosaur he had ever seen. He likened its physical appearance to Darth Vader and a vacuum cleaner, and compared its tooth shear with a conveyor belt and sharpened piano keys.
Teeth similar to those of "Nigersaurus" have been found on the Isle of Wight and in Brazil, but it is unknown whether they belonged to relatives of this taxon, or to titanosaurs, whose remains have been found in the vicinity. A lower jaw assigned to the titanosaur "Antarctosaurus" is likewise similar to that of "Nigersaurus", but may have evolved convergently.
Classification.
The remains of "Nigersaurus" were initially described in 1976 as belonging to a dicraeosaurid, but in 1999 Sereno's team reclassified it as a rebbachisaurid diplodocoid. Rebbachisauridae is the basalmost family within the superfamily Diplodocoidea, which also contains the long-necked diplodocids and the short-necked dicraeosaurids. The subfamily Nigersaurinae, which includes "Nigersaurus" and closely related genera, was named by John A. Whitlock in 2011. Below is a cladogram following an analysis by Federico Fanti and colleagues (2013), which confirmed the placement of "Nigersaurus" as a basal nigersaurine rebbachisaurid.
The closely related genus "Demandasaurus" from Spain was described in 2003, and along with other animal groups that span the Cretaceous of Africa and Europe, this indicates that carbonate platforms connected these landmasses across the Tethys Sea. This was supported in 2013 by the description of the nigersaurine "Tataouinea" from Tunisia, which was more related to the European form than to "Nigersaurus", despite being from Africa, then part of the supercontinent Gondwana. The discovery of these basal diplodocoids may indicate that short necks and small size were ancestral features of the group. Pneumatisation of the rebbachisaurid skeleton evolved progressively, culminating in the nigersaurines.
Palaeobiology.
"Nigersaurus" was suggested by Sereno and colleagues to be a ground-level, non-selective browser. The width of the muzzle and lateral orientation of the tooth row show that the sauropod could gather lots of food and crop it close to the ground, within one metre of the surface. This is further supported by facets on the labial (externally facing) side of the upper teeth, similar to "Dicraeosaurus" and "Diplodocus", which are evidence that food or substrate wore the animal's teeth as it fed. "Nigersaurus" also bears signs of low-angle tooth-to-tooth wear on the inside of the maxillary crowns, which suggests that jaw movement was limited to precise up-and-down motions. Worn teeth from the lower jaw have not yet been discovered, but they are expected to show opposing tooth-to-tooth wear. The ability to raise their heads well above the ground does not necessarily mean they browsed on items there, and the short neck of "Nigersaurus" would have restricted the browsing range compared to other diplodocoids. 
The adductor muscle of the jaw appears to have attached to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and "Nigersaurus" is estimated to have had one of the weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it probably would not have been able to chew. "Nigersaurus" wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to "Nigersaurus", sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.
Though it had large nostrils and a fleshy snout, "Nigersaurus" had an underdeveloped olfactory region of its brain and thus did not have an advanced sense of smell. Its brain-to-body-mass ratio was average for a reptile, and smaller than those of ornithischians and non-coelurosaurian theropods. The cerebrum comprised about 30% of the brain volume, as in many other dinosaurs.
Head posture.
On the basis of microtomography scans of skull elements of the holotype specimen, Sereno's team created a "prototype" "Nigersaurus" skull they could examine. They also made an endocast of the brain and scanned the semicircular canals of its inner ear, which they found to be oriented horizontally. In their 2007 study, they stated that the structure of the occiput and cervical vertebrae would have limited the upward and downward movement of the neck and the rotation of the skull. Based on this biomechanical analysis, the team concluded that the head and muzzle were habitually oriented 67° downwards and close to ground level, as an adaptation for ground-level browsing. This is unlike the way other sauropods have been restored, with their heads held more horizontally.
A 2009 study by Mike P. Taylor, Mathew Wedel, and Darren Naish agreed that "Nigersaurus" was able to feed with the downturned head and neck posture proposed by the 2007 study, but contested that this was the habitual posture of the animal. The study noted that the "neutral" head and neck posture of modern animals does not necessarily correspond to their habitual head posture. It further argued that the orientation of the semicircular canals varies significantly within modern species, and is therefore not reliable for determining head posture. This was supported by a 2013 study that suggested the methods used by Sereno's team were imprecise, and that "Nigersaurus" habitually held its head like other sauropods.
Palaeoecology.
The Elrhaz Formation consists mainly of fluvial sandstones with low relief, much of which is obscured by sand dunes. The sediments are coarse- to medium-grained, with almost no fine-grained horizons. "Nigersaurus" lived in what is now Niger about 115 to 105 million years ago, during the Aptian and Albian ages of the mid-Cretaceous. It likely lived in habitats dominated by inland floodplains (a riparian zone). After the iguanodontian "Lurdusaurus", it was the most numerous megaherbivore. Other herbivores from the same formation include "Ouranosaurus", "Elrhazosaurus", and an unnamed titanosaur. It also lived alongside the theropods "Kryptops", "Suchomimus", and "Eocarcharia", and a yet-unnamed noasaurid. Crocodylomorphs like "Sarcosuchus", "Anatosuchus", "Araripesuchus", and "Stolokrosuchus" also lived there. In addition, remains of a pterosaur, chelonians, fish, a hybodont shark, and freshwater bivalves have been found. Grass did not evolve until the late Cretaceous, making ferns, horsetails, and angiosperms (which had evolved by the middle Cretaceous) potential food for "Nigersaurus". It is unlikely the dinosaur fed on conifers, cycads, or aquatic vegetation, due respectively to their height, hard and stiff structure, and lack of appropriate habitat.

Tarzan

Tarzan ("...the Apeman") is a fictional character, an archetypal feral child raised in the African jungles by the Mangani "great apes"; he later experiences civilization only to largely reject it and return to the wild as a heroic adventurer. Created by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan first appeared in the novel "Tarzan of the Apes" (magazine publication 1912, book publication 1914), and then in twenty-five sequels, three authorized books by other authors, and innumerable works in other media, authorized and not.
Character biography.
Childhood years.
Tarzan is the son of a British lord and lady who were marooned on the Atlantic coast of Africa by mutineers. When Tarzan was only an infant, his mother died of natural causes and his father was killed by Kerchak, leader of the ape tribe by whom Tarzan was adopted. Tarzan's tribe of apes is known as the Mangani, Great Apes of a species unknown to science. Kala is his ape mother. Burroughs added stories occurring during Tarzan's adolescence in his sixth Tarzan book, "Jungle Tales of Tarzan". Tarzan is his ape name; his real English name is John Clayton, Viscount Greystoke (according to Burroughs in "Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle"; Earl of Greystoke in later, less canonical sources, notably the 1984 movie "Greystoke"). In fact, Burroughs's narrator in "Tarzan of the Apes" describes both Clayton and Greystoke as fictitious names – implying that, within the fictional world that Tarzan inhabits, he may have a different "real" name.
Adult life.
As a young adult, Tarzan meets a young American woman, Jane Porter. She, her father, and others of their party are marooned on exactly the same coastal jungle area where Tarzan's biological parents were twenty years earlier. When Jane returns to the United States, Tarzan leaves the jungle in search of her, his one true love. In "The Return of Tarzan", Tarzan and Jane marry. In later books he lives with her for a time in England. They have one son, Jack, who takes the ape name Korak ("the Killer"). Tarzan is contemptuous of the hypocrisy of civilization, and he and Jane return to Africa, making their home on an extensive estate that becomes a base for Tarzan's later adventures.
Characterization.
Burroughs created an extreme example of a noble savage figure largely unalloyed with character flaws or faults. He is described as being Caucasian, extremely athletic, tall, handsome, and tanned, with grey eyes and long black hair. Emotionally, he is courageous, intelligent, loyal, and steadfast. He is presented as behaving ethically in most situations, except when seeking vengeance under the motivation of grief, as when his ape mother Kala is killed in "Tarzan of the Apes", or when he believes Jane has been murdered in "Tarzan the Untamed". He is deeply in love with his wife and totally devoted to her; in numerous situations where other women express their attraction to him, Tarzan politely but firmly declines their attentions. When presented with a situation where a weaker individual or party is being preyed upon by a stronger foe, Tarzan invariably takes the side of the weaker party. In dealing with other men, Tarzan is firm and forceful. With male friends, he is reserved but deeply loyal and generous. As a host, he is likewise, generous, and gracious. As a leader, he commands devoted loyalty.
In keeping with these noble characteristics, Tarzan's philosophy embraces an extreme form of "return to nature". Although he is able to pass within society as a civilized individual, he prefers to "strip off the thin veneer of civilization", as Burroughs often puts it. His preferred dress is a knife and a loincloth of animal hide, his preferred abode is any convenient tree branch when he desires to sleep, and his favored food is raw meat, killed by himself; even better if he is able to bury it a week so that putrefaction has had a chance to tenderize it a bit.
Tarzan's primitivist philosophy was absorbed by countless fans, amongst whom was Jane Goodall, who describes the Tarzan series as having a major influence on her childhood. She states that she felt she would be a much better spouse for Tarzan than his fictional wife, Jane, and that when she first began to live among and study the chimpanzees she was fulfilling her childhood dream of living among the great apes just as Tarzan did.
Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli has been cited as a major influence on Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation of Tarzan. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of other "wild boy" characters.
Skills and abilities.
Tarzan's jungle upbringing gives him abilities far beyond those of ordinary humans. These include climbing, clinging, and leaping as well as any great ape, or better. He uses branches and hanging vines to swing at great speed, a skill acquired among the anthropoid apes.
His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, flexibility, durability, endurance, and swimming are extraordinary in comparison to normal men. He has wrestled full grown bull apes and gorillas, lions, rhinos, crocodiles, pythons, sharks, tigers, man-size seahorses (once) and even dinosaurs (when he visited Pellucidar).
He learns a new language in days, ultimately speaking many languages, including that of the great apes, French, English, Dutch, German, Swahili, many Bantu dialects, Arabic, ancient Greek, ancient Latin, Mayan, the languages of the Ant Men and of Pellucidar.
He also communicates with many species of jungle animals.
In "Tarzan's Quest" (1935), he was one of the recipients of an immortality drug at the end of the book that functionally made him immortal.
Literature.
Tarzan has been called one of the best-known literary characters in the world. In addition to more than two dozen books by Burroughs and a handful more by authors with the blessing of Burroughs' estate, the character has appeared in films, radio, television, comic strips, and comic books. Numerous parodies and pirated works have also appeared.
Burroughs considered other names for the character, including "Zantar" and "Tublat Zan," before he settled on "Tarzan."
Even though the copyright on "Tarzan of the Apes" has expired in the United States of America and other countries, the name Tarzan is claimed as a trademark of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.
Critical reception.
While "Tarzan of the Apes" met with some critical success, subsequent books in the series received a cooler reception and have been criticized for being derivative and formulaic. The characters are often said to be two-dimensional, the dialogue wooden, and the storytelling devices (such as excessive reliance on coincidence) strain credulity. According to author Rudyard Kipling (who himself wrote stories of a feral child, "The Jungle Book"'s Mowgli), Burroughs wrote "Tarzan of the Apes" just so that he could "find out how bad a book he could write and get away with it."
While Burroughs is not a polished novelist, he is a vivid storyteller, and many of his novels are still in print. In 1963, author Gore Vidal wrote a piece on the Tarzan series that, while pointing out several of the deficiencies that the Tarzan books have as works of literature, praises Edgar Rice Burroughs for creating a compelling "daydream figure". Critical reception grew more positive with the 1981 study by Erling B. Holtsmark, "Tarzan and Tradition: Classical Myth in Popular Literature". Holtsmark added a volume on Burroughs for Twayne's United States Author Series in 1986. In 2010, Stan Galloway provided a sustained study of the adolescent period of the fictional Tarzan's life in "The Teenage Tarzan".
Despite critical panning, the Tarzan stories have remained popular. Burroughs's melodramatic situations and the elaborate details he works into his fictional world, such as his construction of a partial language for his great apes, appeal to a worldwide fan base.
The Tarzan books and movies employ extensive stereotyping to a degree common in the times in which they were written. This has led to criticism in later years, with changing social views and customs, including charges of racism since the early 1970s. The early books give a pervasively negative and stereotypical portrayal of native Africans, both Arab and Black. In "The Return of Tarzan", Arabs are "surly looking" and call Christians "dogs", while blacks are "lithe, ebon warriors, gesticulating and jabbering". One could make an equal argument that when it came to blacks that Burroughs was simply depicting unwholesome characters as unwholesome and the good ones in a better light as in Chapter 6 of "Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar" where Burroughs writes of Mugambi, "...nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found in any clime or upon any soil." Other groups are stereotyped as well. A Swede has "a long yellow moustache, an unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails", and Russians cheat at cards. The aristocracy (except the House of Greystoke) and royalty are invariably effete. In later books, Africans are portrayed somewhat more realistically as people. For example, in "Tarzan's Quest", while the depiction of black Africans remains relatively primitive, they are portrayed more individualistically, with a greater variety of character traits, good and bad, while the main villains are whites. Burroughs never loses his distaste for European royalty, though.
Burroughs' opinions, manifested through the narrative voice in the stories, reflect common attitudes in his time, which in a 21st-century context would be considered racist and sexist. However Thomas F. Bertonneau writes about Burroughs "conception of the feminine that elevates the woman to the same level as the man and that – in such characters as Dian of the Pellucidar novels or Dejah Thoris of the Barsoom novels – figures forth a female type who corresponds neither to desperate housewife, full-lipped prom-date, middle-level careerist office-manager, nor frowning ideological feminist-professor, but who exceeds all these by bounds in her realized humanity and in so doing suggests their insipidity." The author is not especially mean-spirited in his attitudes. His heroes do not engage in violence against women or in racially motivated violence. In "Tarzan of the Apes", details of a background of suffering experienced at the hands of whites by Mbonga's "once great" people are repeatedly told with evident sympathy, and in explanation or even justification of their current animosity toward whites.
Although the character of Tarzan does not directly engage in violence against women, feminist scholars have critiqued the presence of other sympathetic male characters that engage in this violence with Tarzan's approval. In "Tarzan and the Ant Men", the men of a fictional tribe of creatures called the Alali gain social dominance of their society by beating the Alali women into submission with weapons that Tarzan willingly provides them. Following the battle, Burroughs states: "To entertain Tarzan and to show him what great strides civilization had taken—the son of The First Woman seized a female by the hair and dragging her to him struck her heavily about the head and face with his clenched fist, and the woman fell upon her knees and fondled his legs, looking wistfully into his face, her own glowing with love and admiration. (178)" While Burroughs writes some female characters with humanistic equalizing elements, Torgovnick argues that violent scenes against women in the context of male political and social domination are condoned in his writing, reinforcing a notion of gendered hierarchy where patriarchy is portrayed as the natural pinnacle of society.
In regards to race, a superior-inferior relationship with valuation is also accordingly implied, as it is unmistakable in virtually all interactions between whites and blacks in the Tarzan stories, and similar relationships and valuations can be seen in most other interactions between differing people although one could argue that such interactions are the bedrock of the dramatic narrative and without such valuations there is no story. According to James Loewen's "Sundown Towns", this may be a vestige of Burroughs' having been from Oak Park, Illinois, a former Sundown town (a town that forbids non-whites from living within it).
Gail Bederman takes a different view in her "Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880-1917". There she describes how various people of the time either challenged or upheld the idea that "civilization" is predicated on white masculinity. She closes with a chapter on 1912's "Tarzan of the Apes" because the story's protagonist is, according to her, the ultimate male by the standards of 1912 white America. Bederman does note that Tarzan, "an instinctivily chivalrous Anglo-Saxon" does not engage in sexual violence, renouncing his "masculine impulse to rape." However, she also notes that not only does Tarzan kill black man Kulonga in revenge for killing his ape mother (a stand in for his biological white mother) by hanging him, "lyncher Tarzan" actually enjoys killing black people, the cannibalistic Mbongans, for example. Bederman, in fact, reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane he does so as "Tarzan, the killer of beasts and many black men." The novel climaxes with Tarzan saving Jane—who in the original novel is not British but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland—from a black ape rapist. When he leaves the jungle and sees "civilized" Africans farming, his first instinct is to kill them just for being black. "Like the lynch victims reported in the Northern press, Tarzan's victims--cowards, cannibals, and despoilers of white womanhood--lack all manhood. Tarzan's lynchings thus prove himself the superior man."
Despite embodying all the tropes of white supremacy espoused or rejected by the people she had reviewed (Theodore Roosevelt, G. Stanley Hall, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ida B. Wells), Bederman states that, in all probability, Burroughs was not trying to make any kind of statement or echo any of them. "He probably never heard of any of them." Instead, Bederman writes that Burroughs proves her point because in telling racist and sexist stories whose protagonist boasted of killing blacks, he was not being unusual at all but was instead just being a typical 1912 white American.
Tarzan is a white European male who grows up with apes. According to "Taking Tarzan Seriously" by Marianna Torgovnick, Tarzan is confused with the social hierarchy that he is a part of. Unlike everyone else in his society, Tarzan is the only one who is not clearly part of any social group. All the other members of Tarzan's world are not able to climb or decline socially because they are already part of a social hierarchy which is stagnant. Turgovnick writes that since Tarzan was raised as an ape, he thinks and acts like an ape. However, instinctively he is human and he resorts to being human when he is pushed to. The reason of his confusion is that he does not understand what the typical white male is supposed to act like. His instincts eventually kick in when he is in the midst of this confusion, and he ends up dominating the jungle. In Tarzan, the jungle is a microcosm for the world in general in 1912 to the early 1930s. His climbing of the social hierarchy proves that the European white male is the most dominant of all races/sexes, no matter what the circumstance. Furthermore, Turgovnick writes that when Tarzan first meets Jane, she is slightly repulsed but also fascinated by his animal-like actions. As the story progresses, Tarzan surrenders his knife to Jane in an oddly chivalrous gesture, which makes Jane fall for Tarzan despite of his odd circumstance. Turgovnick believes that this displays an instinctual, civilized chivalry that Burrough believes is common of white men.
Unauthorized works.
After Burroughs' death a number of writers produced new Tarzan stories. In some instances, the estate managed to prevent publication of such works. The most notable example in the United States was a series of five novels by the pseudonymous "Barton Werper" that appeared 1964-65 by Gold Star Books (part of Charlton Comics). As a result of legal action by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc., they were taken off the market and remaining copies destroyed. 
Similar series appeared in other countries, notably Argentina, Israel, and some Arab countries.
In Israel in the 1950s and early 1960s there was a thriving industry of locally-produced Tarzan adventures published weekly in 24-page brochures by several competing publishing houses, none of which worked with the Burroughs estate. The stories featured Tarzan in contemporary Africa. A popular theme being his fighting against the Mau Mau in 1950s Kenya and single-handedly crushing their revolt several times over. He also fought a great variety of monsters, vampires and invaders from outer space infesting the African jungles and discovered several more lost cities and cultures in addition to the ones depicted in the Burroughs canon. Some brochures had him meet with Israelis and take Israel's side against her Arab enemies, especially Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt.
None of the brochures credited an author, and the various publishers - "Elephant Publishing" (), "Rhino Publishing" () and several similar names - provided no more of an address than POB numbers in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. These Tarzan brochures were extremely popular among Israeli youths of the time, successfully competing with the numerous Hebrew translations of the original Tarzan novels. The Tarzan brochures faded out by the middle 1960s. Surviving copies have fetched high prices as collectors' items in the Israeli used-book market. Researcher Eli Eshed has spent considerable time and effort on the Tarzan brochures and other Israeli pulp magazines and paperbacks.
The "Barton Werper" novels still exist and are available via the Internet 
In the 1950s new Tarzan stories were also published in Syria and Lebanon. Tarzan in these versions was a staunch supporter of the Arab cause and helped his Arab friends foil various fiendish Israeli plots.
Modern fiction.
In 1972, Science fiction author Philip José Farmer wrote "Tarzan Alive", a biography of Tarzan utilizing the frame device that he was a real person. In Farmer's fictional universe, Tarzan, along with Doc Savage and Sherlock Holmes, are the cornerstones of the Wold Newton family. Farmer wrote two novels, "Hadon of Ancient Opar" and "Flight to Opar", set in the distant past and giving the antecedents of the lost city of Opar, which plays an important role in the Tarzan books. In addition, Farmer's "A Feast Unknown", and its two sequels "Lord of the Trees" and "The Mad Goblin", are pastiches of the Tarzan and Doc Savage stories, with the premise that they tell the story of the real characters the fictional characters are based upon. "A Feast Unknown" is somewhat infamous among Tarzan and Doc Savage fans for its graphic violence and sexual content.
Tarzan in film and other non-print media.
Film.
The Internet Movie Database lists 200 movies with Tarzan in the title between 1918 and 2014. The first Tarzan movies were silent pictures adapted from the original Tarzan novels, which appeared within a few years of the character's creation. The first actor to portray the adult Tarzan was Elmo Lincoln in 1918's "Tarzan Of The Apes". With the advent of talking pictures, a popular Tarzan movie franchise was developed, which lasted from the 1930s through the 1960s. Starting with "Tarzan the Ape Man" in 1932 through twelve films until 1948, the franchise was anchored by former Olympic swimmer Johnny Weissmuller in the title role. Weissmuller and his immediate successors were enjoined to portray the ape-man as a noble savage speaking broken English, in marked contrast to the cultured aristocrat of Burroughs's novels.
With the exception of the Burroughs co-produced "The New Adventures of Tarzan", this "me Tarzan, you Jane" characterization of Tarzan persisted until the late 1950s, when producer Sy Weintraub, having bought the film rights from producer Sol Lesser, produced "Tarzan's Greatest Adventure" followed by eight other films and a television series. The Weintraub productions portray a Tarzan that is closer to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original concept in the novels: a jungle lord who speaks grammatical English and is well educated and familiar with civilization. Most Tarzan films made before the mid-fifties were black-and-white films shot on studio sets, with stock jungle footage edited in. The Weintraub productions from 1959 on were shot in foreign locations and were in color.
There were also several serials and features that competed with the main franchise, including "Tarzan the Fearless" (1933) starring Buster Crabbe and "The New Adventures of Tarzan" (1935) starring Herman Brix. The latter serial was unique for its period in that it was partially filmed on location (Guatemala) and portrayed Tarzan as educated. It was the only Tarzan film project for which Edgar Rice Burroughs was personally involved in the production.
Tarzan films from the 1930s on often featured Tarzan's chimpanzee companion Cheeta, his consort Jane (not usually given a last name), and an adopted son, usually known only as "Boy." The Weintraub productions from 1959 on dropped the character of Jane and portrayed Tarzan as a lone adventurer. Later Tarzan films have been occasional and somewhat idiosyncratic. Recently, Tony Goldwyn portrayed Tarzan in Disney’s animated film of the same name (1999). This version marked a new beginning for the ape man, taking its inspiration equally from Burroughs and the 1984 film "".
Radio.
Tarzan was the hero of two popular radio programs in the United States. The first aired from 1932–1936 with James Pierce in the role of Tarzan. The second ran from 1951–1953 with Lamont Johnson in the title role.
Television.
Television later emerged as a primary vehicle bringing the character to the public. From the mid-1950s, all the extant sound Tarzan films became staples of Saturday morning television aimed at young and teenaged viewers. In 1958, movie Tarzan Gordon Scott filmed three episodes for a prospective television series. The program did not sell, but a different live action "Tarzan" series produced by Sy Weintraub and starring Ron Ely ran on NBC from 1966 to 1968. An animated series from Filmation, "Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle", aired from 1976 to 1977, followed by the anthology programs "Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour" (1977–1978), "Tarzan and the Super 7" (1978–1980), "The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour" (1980–1981), and "The Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour") (1981–1982). Joe Lara starred in the title role in "Tarzan in Manhattan" (1989), an offbeat TV movie, and later returned in a completely different interpretation in ' (1996), a new live-action series. In between the two productions with Lara, "Tarzán", a half-hour syndicated series ran from 1991 through 1994. In this version of the show, Tarzan was portrayed as a blond environmentalist, with Jane turned into a French ecologist. Disney’s animated series "The Legend of Tarzan" (2001–2003) was a spin-off from its animated film. The latest television series was the live-action "Tarzan" (2003), which starred male model Travis Fimmel and updated the setting to contemporary New York City, with Jane as a police detective, played by Sarah Wayne Callies. The series was cancelled after only eight episodes. A 1981 television special, ', features a short sketch titled "Tarzan and Jane". Lily Tomlin plays Jane opposite The Great Gonzo as Tarzan. In addition, the Muppets have since the 1960s. "Saturday Night Live" featured recurring sketches with the speech-impaired trio of "Frankenstein, Tonto, and Tarzan".
Stage.
A 1921 Broadway production of "Tarzan of The Apes" starred Ronald Adair as Tarzan and Ethel Dwyer as Jane Porter. In 1976, Richard O'Brien wrote a musical entitled "T. Zee", loosely based on Tarzan but restyled in a rock idiom. "Tarzan", a musical stage adaptation of the 1999 animated feature, opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway on May 10, 2006. The show, a Disney Theatrical production, was directed and designed by Bob Crowley. The same version of Tarzan that was played at the Richard Rodgers Theatre is being played throughout Europe and has been a huge success in the Netherlands. The Broadway show closed on July 8, 2007. Tarzan also appeared in the "Tarzan Rocks!" show at the Theatre in the Wild at Walt Disney World Resort's Disney's Animal Kingdom. The show closed in 2006.
Video and computer games.
In the mid-1980s there was an arcade video game called "Jungle King" that featured a Tarzanesque character in a loin cloth. A game under the title "Tarzan Goes Ape" was released in the 1980s for the Commodore 64. A "Tarzan" computer game by Michael Archer was produced by Martech. Disney's Tarzan had seen video games released for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color. Followed by "Disney's Tarzan Untamed" for the PS2 and Gamecube. Tarzan also appeared in the PS2 game "Kingdom Hearts," although this Tarzan was shown in the Disney context, not the original conceptional idea of Tarzan by Bourroughs. In the first "Rayman", a Tarzannesque version of Rayman named Tarayzan appears in the Dream Forest.
Action figures.
Throughout the 1970s Mego Corporation licensed the Tarzan character and produced 8" action figures which they included in their "World's Greatest Super Heroes" line of characters. In 1975 they also produced a 3" "Bendy" figure made of poseable, malleable plastic.
Ephemera.
Several Tarzan-themed products have been manufactured, including View-Master reels and packets, numerous Tarzan coloring books, children's books, follow-the-dots, and activity books.
Tarzan in comics.
"Tarzan of the Apes" was adapted in newspaper strip form, in early 1929, with illustrations by Hal Foster. A full page Sunday strip began March 15, 1931 by Rex Maxon. Over the years, many artists have drawn the "Tarzan" comic strip, notably Burne Hogarth, Russ Manning, and Mike Grell. The daily strip began to reprint old dailies after the last Russ Manning daily (#10,308, which ran on 29 July 1972). The Sunday strip also turned to reprints circa 2000. Both strips continue as reprints today in a few newspapers and in "Comics Revue" magazine. NBM Publishing did a high quality reprint series of the Foster and Hogarth work on Tarzan in a series of hardback and paperback reprints in the 1990s.
Tarzan has appeared in many comic books from numerous publishers over the years. The character's earliest comic book appearances were in comic strip reprints published in several titles, such as "Sparkler", "Tip Top Comics" and "Single Series". Western Publishing published "Tarzan" in Dell Comics's "Four Color Comics" #134 & 161 in 1947, before giving him his own series, "Tarzan", published through Dell Comics and later Gold Key Comics from January–February 1948 to February 1972). DC took over the series in 1972, publishing "Tarzan" #207-258 from April 1972 to February 1977, including work by Joe Kubert. In 1977 the series moved to Marvel Comics, which restarted the numbering rather than assuming that used by the previous publishers. Marvel issued "Tarzan" #1-29 (as well as three Annuals), from June 1977 to October 1979, mainly by John Buscema. Following the conclusion of the Marvel series the character had no regular comic book publisher for a number of years. During this period Blackthorne Comics published "Tarzan" in 1986, and Malibu Comics published "Tarzan" comics in 1992. Dark Horse Comics has published various "Tarzan" series from 1996 to the present, including reprints of works from previous publishers like Gold Key and DC, and joint projects with other publishers featuring crossovers with other characters.
There have also been a number of different comic book projects from other publishers over the years, in addition to various minor appearances of Tarzan in other comic books. The Japanese manga series "Jungle no Ouja Ta-chan" (Jungle King Tar-chan) by Tokuhiro Masaya was based loosely on Tarzan. Also, manga "god" Osamu Tezuka created a Tarzan manga in 1948 entitled "Tarzan no Himitsu Kichi" ("Tarzan's Secret Base").
Works inspired by Tarzan.
In the 1940s, the Finnish writer Lahja Valakivi published four adventure novels about "Tarsa karhumies", i.e., Tarsa the Bear Man. The books were obviously inspired by Tarzan, but they were adapted into a Finnish setting: as there are no apes in Finland, the hero Tarsa was raised by bears instead.
Tarzan's popularity inspired numerous imitators that appeared in pulp magazines. A number of these like Kwa and Ka-Zar were direct or loosely veiled copies, others like Polaris of the Snows were similar characters in different settings, or with different gimmicks. Of these characters the most popular was Ki-Gor, he starred in fifty-nine novels that appeared between winter 1939 to spring 1954 in the magazine Jungle Stories.
In 1950, the Italian comics series Akim was created as a rather straight copy of Tarzan. It was published between 1950-1967, and 1976-1983.
In 1967, Jay Ward Productions released the animated series "George of the Jungle", a Tarzanesque ape man. Later on a film was made starring Brendan Fraser, later a direct-to-video sequel was made.
Disney released "The World's Greatest Athlete" in 1973, which was about a Tarzanesque figure named Nanu (Jan-Michael Vincent) who was spotted by a Safari guide with American coaches to participate in sports competitions.
In 2007, a Canadian remake of the original George of the Jungle cartoon was made, it aired on Teletoon in Canada and Cartoon Network in America. A video game based on the show released for the Wii, PS2, and the Nintendo DS.
The Japanese manga series "Jungle no Ouja Ta-chan" (Ta-chan, King of the Jungle) by Tokuhiro Masaya was based loosely on Tarzan. It was later made into an anime series. It featured the characters of Tarzan and his wife Jane, who had become obese after settling down with Tarzan. The series begins as a comical parody of Tarzan, but later expands to other settings, such as a martial arts tournament in China, professional wrestling in America, and even a fight with vampires.
The late comedian George Carlin mentioned Tarzan when he was doing his HBO stand up It's Bad For Ya when he was talking about how to deal with boring people in public or on the phone.
In Asia, Philippine Cinema's inclination in satirizing western entertainment produced "Starzan", a comedy film loosely based on the original Tarzan franchise. It stars Filipino comedic actor Joey De Leon as Starzan, Rene Requiestas as "Chitae", and Zsa Zsa Padilla as Jane.
Tarzan appears briefly as a character in the book "Lust", by Geoff Ryman.
Neil Gaiman's The Graveyard Book had some similar concepts from Tarzan.
Warren Ellis' and John Cassaday's Planetary features in its issues 1 and 17 a British Tarzan-like character, Kevin Sack, Lord Blackstock, who was "lost as an infant, raised by jungle fauna" and now (the 1930s in issue 17) "comes back to Africa every few years".
In popular culture.
Tarzan is often used as a nickname to indicate a similarity between a person's characteristics and that of the fictional character. Individuals with an exceptional 'ape-like' ability to climb, cling and leap beyond that of ordinary humans may often receive the nickname 'Tarzan'. An example is retired American baseball player Joe Wallis.
British politician Michael Heseltine is nicknamed Tarzan, and was often portrayed as such in the press.
The Jungle Book character Mowgli is similar to Tarzan in the sense they are raised by animals, though Kipling's stories featuring him first appeared in 1893, predating Burrough's works.

Public Law 110-343

Public Law 110-343 () is a US Act of Congress signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush, which was designed to mitigate the growing financial crisis of the late-2000s by giving relief to so-called "Troubled Assets."
Its formal title is "An Act To provide authority for the Federal Government to purchase and insure certain types of troubled assets for the purposes of providing stability to and preventing disruption in the economy and financial system and protecting taxpayers, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for energy production and conservation, to extend certain expiring provisions, to provide individual income tax relief, and for other purposes."
The Act created a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (), and also enacted the "Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008" (), "Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008" (), which also included the "Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008", and the "Heartland Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2008".
Legislative history.
The first version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (structured as an amendment to ) was rejected by the House of Representatives on September 29.
After its defeat, Senate leaders decided to amend an existing bill from the House in order to circumvent the revenue origination clause of U.S. Constitution, and chose H.R. 1424 as the vehicle for the legislation. 
H.R. 1424 was sponsored by United States House Representative Patrick J. Kennedy.
On September 30, 2008, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the proposed draft had been formalized for the amendment that would transform H.R. 1424 into the Senate version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
On October 1, 2008, the amendment to H.R. 1424 was approved by a vote of 74 to 25, and the entire amended bill was passed by 74 to 25, (with one not voting, the cancer-stricken Senator Ted Kennedy). The bill was returned to the House for consideration.
On October 3, 2008, the bill as passed by the Senate was accepted by a vote of 263 to 171 in the House. Every member of the House voted, though the House had a vacant seat of the recently deceased Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law a few hours later.
Three divisions of the Act.
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
The "Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008" is part of an effort to bail out firms holding mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to restore liquidity to the credit markets.
Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008.
The "Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008" contains a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for less than a year after the first 250,000 are sold. The credit is a base $2,500 plus $417 for each kWh of battery pack capacity in excess of 4 kWh to a maximum of $15,000 for any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than and up to $7,500 for 12 kWh or more in passenger cars (vehicles up to ).
It also extends existing tax credits for renewable energy initiatives, including cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel development, and wind, solar, geothermal and hydro-electric power. It establishes electricity as a clean-burning fuel for tax purposes.
Separately, this section also requires the reporting of cost basis by brokers to the IRS for certain securities acquired after 2011 – see covered security.
Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008.
The "Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act" includes $100 billion in tax breaks for businesses and the middle class, plus a provision to raise the cap on federal deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000.
The Act keeps the alternative minimum tax from hitting 20 million middle-income Americans. It provides $8 billion in tax relief for those hit by natural disasters in the Midwest, Texas and Louisiana.
As a whole, the Senate tax package would cost $150.5 billion over 10 years. Roughly $43.5 billion would be offset by several revenue-raising provisions. Hedge fund managers would be forbidden from using offshore corporations to defer paying taxes.
The bill freezes a tax deduction that oil and gas companies get for certain domestic production activities. The deduction, now 6 percent, is scheduled to rise to 9 percent in 2010.
The provisions of the tax bill included:
Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008.
The "Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008" (a part of Division C) mandates that if U.S. health insurance companies provide coverage for mental health and substance abuse, the coverage must be equal for conditions such as psychological disorders, alcoholism, and drug addiction.
This act continues and expands upon the previous Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. It states that financial requirements such as deductibles and copayments and lifetime or dollar limits to mental health benefits and substance abuse disorder benefits should be no more restrictive than those on medical and surgical benefits. MHPAEA applies to employer-sponsored health insurance plans with more than 50 employees, though parity is also extended to small group and individual plans under the Affordable Care Act.
Cost.
The Act increased the statutory limit on the public debt by US$ 700 billion to US$ 11.3 trillion. However, the legislation is designed to have a net zero long-term cost, and includes language that mandates the President and Congress to develop a plan to recoup any money that is not recouped within 5 years.
Reception.
Journalists and critics commented that portions of the bill contained earmarks and pork barrel spending.

Phrygia

In antiquity, Phrygia (; , , ) was a kingdom in the west central part of Anatolia, in what is now Turkey, centered around the Sakarya River.
The Phrygians are most famous for their legendary kings of the heroic age of Greek mythology: Gordias whose Gordian Knot would later be untied by Alexander the Great, Midas who turned whatever he touched to gold, and Mygdon who warred with the Amazons. According to Homer's Iliad, the Phrygians were close allies of the Trojans and participants in the Trojan War against the Achaeans. Phrygian power reached its peak in the late 8th century BC under another, historical king Midas, who dominated most of western and central Anatolia and rivaled Assyria and Urartu for power in eastern Anatolia. This later Midas was, however, also the last independent king of Phrygia before its capital Gordium was sacked by Cimmerians around 695 BC. Phrygia then became subject to Lydia, and then successively to Persia, Alexander and his Hellenistic successors, Pergamon, Rome and Byzantium. Phrygians were gradually assimilated into other cultures by the early medieval era, and after the Turkish conquest of Anatolia the name Phrygia passed out of usage as a territorial designation.
Origins.
Inscriptions found at Gordium make clear that Phrygians spoke an Indo-European language with at least some vocabulary similar to Greek, and clearly not belonging to the family of Anatolian languages spoken by most of Phrygia's neighbors. One of the so-called Homeric Hymns describes the Phrygian language as not mutually intelligible with Trojan.
According to ancient tradition among Greek historians, the Phrygians anciently migrated to Anatolia from the Balkans. Herodotus says the Phrygians were called Bryges when they lived in Europe. He and other Greek writers also recorded legends about King Midas that associated him with or put his origin in Macedonia; Herodotus, for example, says a wild rose garden in Macedonia was named after Midas. The Phrygians were also connected by some classical writers to the Mygdones, the name of two groups of people, one of which lived in northern Macedonia and another in Mysia. Likewise the Phrygians have been identified with the Bebryces, a people said to have warred with Mysia before the Trojan War and who had a king named Mygdon at roughly the same time as the Phrygians were said to have had a king named Mygdon. The classical historian Strabo groups Phrygians, Mygdones, Mysians, Bebryces and Bithynians together as peoples that migrated to Anatolia from the Balkans. This image of Phrygians as part of a related group of northwest Anatolian cultures seems the most likely explanation for the confusion over whether Phrygians, Bebryces and Anatolian Mygdones were or were not the same people.
The apparent similarity of the Phrygian language to Greek and its dissimilarity with the Anatolian languages spoken by most of their neighbors is also taken as support for a European origin of the Phrygians. Phrygian continued to be spoken until sixth century AD, though its distinctive alphabet was lost earlier than those of most Anatolian cultures.
Some scholars have theorized that such a migration could have occurred more recently than classical sources suggest, and have sought to fit the Phrygian arrival into a narrative explaining the downfall of the Hittite Empire and the end of the high Bronze Age in Anatolia. According to this recent migration theory, the Phrygians invaded just before or after the collapse of the Hittite Empire at the beginning of the 12th century BC, filling the political vacuum in central-western Anatolia, and may have been counted among the "Sea Peoples" that Egyptian records credit with bringing about the Hittite collapse. The so-called Handmade Knobbed Ware found in Western Anatolia during this period has been suggested to be an import connected to this invasion.
However, most scholars reject such a recent Phrygian migration and accept as factual the Iliad's account that the Phrygians were established on the Sakarya River before the Trojan War, and thus must have been there during the later stages of the Hittite Empire, and probably earlier. These scholars seek instead to trace the Phrygians' origins among the many nations of western Anatolia who were subject to the Hittites. This interpretation also gets support from Greek legends about the founding of Phrygia's main city Gordium by Gordias and of Ancyra by Midas, which suggest that Gordium and Ancyra were believed to be date from the distant past before the Trojan War. Some scholars dismiss the claim of a Phrygian migration as a mere legend, likely arising from the coincidental similarity of their name to the Bryges.
No one has conclusively identified which of the many subjects of the Hittites might have represented early Phrygians. According to a classical tradition, popularized by Josephus, Phrygia can be equated with the country called Togarmah by the ancient Hebrews, which has in turn been identified as the Tegarama of Hittite texts and Til-Garimmu of Assyrian records. Josephus called Togarmah "the Thrugrammeans, who, as the Greeks resolved, were named Phrygians". However, the Greek source cited by Josephus is unknown, and it is unclear if there was any basis for the identification other than name similarity. Scholars of the Hittites believe Tegarama was in eastern Anatolia - some locate it at Gurun - far to the east of Phrygia. Some scholars have identified Phrygia with the Assuwa league, and noted that the Iliad mentions a Phrygian (Queen Hecuba's brother) named Asios. Another possible early name of Phrygia could be Hapalla, the name of the easternmost province that emerged from the splintering of the Bronze Age western Anatolian empire Arzawa. However, scholars are unsure if Hapalla corresponds to Phrygia or to Pisidia, further south.
A further claim made by Herodotus is that Phrygian colonists founded the Armenian nation. This is likely a reference to a third group of people called Mygdones living in northern Mesopotamia who were apparently allied to the Armenians; Xenophon describes them in his Anabasis in a joint army with the Armenians. However, little is known about these eastern Mygdones, and no evidence of Phrygian language in that region has been found.
History.
Around the time of the Trojan war.
According to the Iliad, the homeland of the Phrygians was on the Sangarius River, which would remain the centre of Phrygia throughout its history. Phrygia was famous for its wine and had "brave and expert" horsemen.
According to the Iliad, before the Trojan War, a young king Priam of Troy had taken an army to Phrygia to support it in a war against the Amazons. Homer calls the Phrygians "the people of Otreus and godlike Mygdon. According to Euripides, Quintus Smyrnaeus and others, this Mygdon's son, Coroebus, fought and died in the Trojan War; he had sued for the hand of the Trojan princess Cassandra in marriage. The name "Otreus" could be an eponym for Otroea, a place on Lake Ascania in the vicinity of the later Nicaea, and the name "Mygdon" is clearly an eponym for the Mygdones, a people said by Strabo to live in northwest Asia Minor, and who appear to have sometimes been considered distinct from the Phrygians. However, Pausanias believed that Mygdon's tomb was located at Stectorium in the southern Phrygian highlands, near modern Sandikli.
According to the "Bibliotheca", the Greek hero Heracles slew a king Mygdon of the Bebryces in a battle in northwest Anatolia that if historical would have taken place about a generation before the Trojan War. According to the story, while traveling from Minoa to the Amazons, Heracles stopped in Mysia and supported the Mysians in a battle with the Bebryces. According to some interpretations, Bebryces is an alternate name for Phrygians and this Mygdon is the same person mentioned in the Iliad.
King Priam married the Phrygian princess Hecabe (or Hecuba) and maintained a close alliance with the Phrygians, who repaid him by fighting "ardently" in the Trojan War against the Greeks. Hecabe was a daughter of the Phrygian king Dymas, son of Eioneus, son of Proteus. According to the Iliad, Hecabe's younger brother Asius also fought at Troy (see above); and Quintus Smyrnaeus mentions two grandsons of Dymas that fell at the hands of Neoptolemus at the end of the Trojan War: "Two sons he slew of Meges rich in gold, Scion of Dymas - sons of high renown, cunning to hurl the dart, to drive the steed in war, and deftly cast the lance afar, born at one birth beside Sangarius' banks of Periboea to him, Celtus one, and Eubius the other." Teleutas, father of the maiden Tecmessa, is mentioned as another mythical Phrygian king.
There are indications in the Iliad that the heart of the Phrygian country was further north and downriver than it would be in later history. The Phrygian contingent arrives to aid Troy coming from Lake Ascania in northwest Anatolia, and is led by Phorcys and Ascanius, both sons of Aretaon.
In one of the so-called Homeric Hymns, Phrygia is said to be "rich in fortresses" and ruled by "famous Otreus".
Peak and destruction of the Phrygian kingdom.
During the 8th century BC the Phrygian kingdom with its capital at Gordium in the upper Sakarya River valley expanded into an empire dominating most of central and western Anatolia and encroaching upon the larger Assyrian Empire to its southeast and the kingdom of Urartu to the northeast.
According to the classical historians Strabo, Eusebius and Julius Africanus, the king of Phrygia during this time was another Midas. This historical Midas is believed to be the same person named as Mita in Assyrian texts from the period and identified as king of the Mushki. Scholars figure that Assyrians called Phrygians "Mushki" because the Phrygians and Mushki, an eastern Anatolian people, were at that time campaigning in a joint army. This Midas is thought to have reigned Phrygia at the peak of its power from about 720 BC to about 695 BC (according to Eusebius) or 676 BC (according to Julius Africanus). An Assyrian inscription mentioning "Mita", dated to 709 BC, during the reign of Sargon of Assyria, suggests Phrygia and Assyria had struck a truce by that time. This Midas appears to have had good relations and close trade ties with the Greeks, and reputedly married an Aeolian Greek princess.
A system of writing in the Phrygian language developed and flourished in Gordium during this period, using a Phoenician-derived alphabet similar to the Greek one. A distinctive Phrygian pottery called Polished Ware appears during this period.
However, the Phrygian Kingdom was then overwhelmed by Cimmerian invaders, and Gordium was sacked and destroyed. According to Strabo and others, Midas committed suicide by drinking bulls' blood.
A series of digs have opened Gordium as one of Turkey's most revealing archeological sites. Excavations confirm a violent destruction of Gordium around 675 BC. A tomb from the period, popularly identified as the "Tomb of Midas," revealed a wooden structure deeply buried under a vast tumulus, containing grave goods, a coffin, furniture, and food offerings (Archaeological Museum, Ankara).
As a Lydian province.
After their destruction of Gordium, the Cimmerians remained in western Anatolia and warred with Lydia, which eventually expelled them by around 620 BC, and then expanded to incorporate Phrygia, which became the Lydian empire's eastern frontier. The Gordium site reveals a considerable building program during the 6th century BC, under the domination of Lydian kings including the proverbially rich King Croesus. Meanwhile, Phrygia's former eastern subjects fell to Assyria and later to the Medes.
There may be an echo of strife with Lydia and perhaps a veiled reference to royal hostages, in the legend of the twice-unlucky Phrygian prince Adrastus, who accidentally killed his brother and exiled himself to Lydia, where King Croesus welcomed him. Once again, Adrastus accidentally killed Croesus' son and then committed suicide.
As a Persian province.
Some time in the 540s BC, Phrygia passed to the Persian Empire when Cyrus conquered Lydia. After Darius became Persian Emperor in 521 BC, he remade the ancient trade route into the Persian "Royal Road" and instituted administrative reforms that included setting up satrapies. The Phrygian satrapy lay west of the Halys River (now Kızıl River) and east of Mysia and Lydia. Its capital was established at Dascylium, modern Ergili.
Under Alexander and his successors.
Alexander the Great passed through Gordium in 333 BC, famously severing the Gordian Knot in the temple of Sabazios ("Zeus"). According to a legend, possibly promulgated by Alexander's publicists, whoever untied the knot would be master of Asia. With Gordium sited on the Persian Royal Road that led through the heart of Anatolia, the prophecy had some geographical plausibility. With Alexander, Phrygia became part of the wider Hellenistic world. Upon Alexander's death in 323, the Battle of Ipsus took place in 301 BC.
In the chaotic period after Alexander's death, northern Phrygia was overrun by Celts, eventually to become the province of Galatia. The former capital of Gordium was captured and destroyed by the Gauls soon afterwards and disappeared from history. In 188 BC, the southern remnant of Phrygia came under the control of the Attalids of Pergamon. However, Phrygian language survived, now written in the Greek alphabet.
Under Rome and Byzantium.
In 133 BC, the remnants of Phrygia passed to Rome. For purposes of provincial administration the Romans maintained a divided Phrygia, attaching the northeastern part to the province of Galatia and the western portion to the province of Asia. During the reforms of Diocletian, Phrygia was divided anew into two provinces: "Phrygia I" or Phrygia Salutaris, and Phrygia II or Pacatiana, both under the Diocese of Asia. Salutaris with Synnada as its capital comprised the eastern portion of the region and Pacatiana with Laodicea on the Lycus as capital the western portion. The provinces survived up to the end of the 7th century, when they were replaced by the Theme system. In the Byzantine period, most of Phrygia belonged to the Anatolic theme. It was overrun by the Turks in the aftermath of the Battle of Manzikert (1071). The Byzantines were finally evicted from there in the 13th century, but the name of "Phrygia" remained in use until the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in 1453.
Culture.
The "Great Mother", Cybele, as the Greeks and Romans knew her, was originally worshipped in the mountains of Phrygia, where she was known as "Mountain Mother". In her typical Phrygian form, she wears a long belted dress, a "polos" (a high cylindrical headdress), and a veil covering the whole body. The later version of Cybele was established by a pupil of Phidias, the sculptor Agoracritus, and became the image most widely adopted by Cybele's expanding following, both in the Aegean world and at Rome. It shows her humanized though still enthroned, her hand resting on an attendant lion and the other holding the "tympanon", a circular frame drum, similar to a tambourine.
The Phrygians also venerated Sabazios, the sky and father-god depicted on horseback. Although the Greeks associated Sabazios with Zeus, representations of him, even at Roman times, show him as a horseman god. His conflicts with the indigenous Mother Goddess, whose creature was the Lunar Bull, may be surmised in the way that Sabazios' horse places a hoof on the head of a bull, in a Roman relief at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
Phrygia developed an advanced Bronze Age culture. The earliest traditions of Greek music derived from Phrygia, transmitted through the Greek colonies in Anatolia, and included the Phrygian mode, which was considered to be the warlike mode in ancient Greek music. Phrygian Midas, the king of the "golden touch", was tutored in music by Orpheus himself, according to the myth. Another musical invention that came from Phrygia was the aulos, a reed instrument with two pipes. Marsyas, the satyr who first formed the instrument using the hollowed antler of a stag, was a Phrygian follower of Cybele. He unwisely competed in music with the Olympian Apollo and inevitably lost, whereupon Apollo flayed Marsyas alive and provocatively hung his skin on Cybele's own sacred tree, a pine.
Phrygia retained a separate cultural identity. Classical Greek iconography identifies the Trojan Paris as non-Greek by his Phrygian cap, which was worn by Mithras and survived into modern imagery as the "Liberty cap" of the American and French revolutionaries.
The Phrygians spoke an Indo-European language. ("See Phrygian language.") Although the Phrygians adopted the alphabet originated by the Phoenicians, only a few dozen inscriptions in the Phrygian language have been found, primarily funereal, and so much of what is thought to be known of Phrygia is second-hand information from Greek sources.
Mythic past.
The name of the earliest known mythical king was Nannacus (aka Annacus). This king resided at Iconium, the most eastern city of the kingdom of Phrygia at that time; and after his death, at the age of 300 years, a great flood overwhelmed the country, as had been foretold by an ancient oracle. The next king mentioned in extant classical sources was called Manis or Masdes. According to Plutarch, because of his splendid exploits, great things were called "manic" in Phrygia. Thereafter the kingdom of Phrygia seems to have become fragmented among various kings. One of the kings was Tantalus who ruled over the north western region of Phrygia around Mount Sipylus. Tantalus was endlessly punished in Tartarus, because he allegedly killed his son Pelops and sacrificially offered him to the Olympians, a reference to the suppression of human sacrifice. Tantalus was also falsely accused of stealing from the lotteries he had invented. In the mythic age before the Trojan war, during a time of an interregnum, Gordius (or Gordias), a Phrygian farmer, became king, fulfilling an oracular prophecy. The kingless Phrygians had turned for guidance to the oracle of Sabazios ("Zeus" to the Greeks) at Telmissus, in the part of Phrygia that later became part of Galatia. They had been instructed by the oracle to acclaim as their king the first man who rode up to the god's temple in a cart. That man was Gordias (Gordios, Gordius), a farmer, who dedicated the ox-cart in question, tied to its shaft with the "Gordian Knot". Gordias refounded a capital at Gordium in west central Anatolia, situated on the old trackway through the heart of Anatolia that became Darius's Persian "Royal Road" from Pessinus to Ancyra, and not far from the River Sangarius.
The Phrygians are associated in Greek mythology with the Dactyls, minor gods credited with the invention of iron smelting, who in most versions of the legend lived at Mount Ida in Phrygia.
Gordias's son (adopted in some versions) was Midas. A large body of myths and legends surround this first king Midas. connecting him with a mythological tale concerning Attis. This shadowy figure resided at Pessinus and attempted to marry his daughter to the young Attis in spite of the opposition of his lover Agdestis and his mother, the goddess Cybele. When Agdestis and/or Cybele appear and cast madness upon the members of the wedding feast. Midas is said to have died in the ensuing chaos.
The famous king Midas is said to have associated himself with Silenus and other satyrs and with Dionysus, who granted him the famous "golden touch".
In one version of his story, Midas travels from Thrace accompanied by a band of his people to Asia Minor to wash away the taint of his unwelcome "golden touch" in the river Pactolus. Leaving the gold in the river's sands, Midas found himself in Phrygia, where he was adopted by the childless king Gordias and taken under the protection of Cybele. Acting as the visible representative of Cybele, and under her authority, it would seem, a Phrygian king could designate his successor.
The Phrygian Sibyl was the priestess presiding over the Apollonian oracle at Phrygia.
According to Herodotus, the Egyptian pharaoh Psammetichus II had two children raised in isolation in order to find the original language. The children were reported to have uttered "bekos" which is Phrygian for "bread", so Psammetichus admitted that the Phrygians were a nation older than the Egyptians.
Christian Phrygia.
The Christian heresy known as Montanism, and still known in Orthodoxy as "the Phrygian heresy", arose in the unidentified village of Ardabau in the second century AD, and was distinguished by ecstatic spirituality and women priests. Originally described as a rural movement, it is now thought to have been of urban origin like other Christian developments. The new Jerusalem its adherents founded in the village of Pepouza has now been identified in a remote valley that later held a monastery.

Judea

Judea or Judæa (; from , Standard "Yəhuda" Tiberian "", , "Yahudia", , "Ioudaía"; ) is the biblical name of the mountainous southern West Bank. The name originates from the biblical tribe of Judah and associated Kingdom of Judah, which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dated from 934 until 586 BCE. The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman periods as Babylonian Judea, Persian Judea, Hasmonean Judea, and consequently Herodian Judea and Roman Judea, respectively. As a consequence of the Bar Kokhba revolt, in 135 CE the region was renamed and merged with Roman Syria to form "Syria Palaestina" by the victorious Roman Emperor Hadrian. The term "Judea" as a geographical term was revived by the Israeli government in the 20th century as part of the Israeli administrative district name Judea and Samaria for the territory generally referred to as the West Bank.
Etymology.
The name "Judea" is a Greek and Roman adaptation of the name "Judah", which originally encompassed the territory of the Israelite tribe of that name and later of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. Nimrud Tablet K.3751, dated c.733 BCE, is the earliest known record of the name Judah (written in Assyrian cuneiform as Yaudaya or KUR.ia-ú-da-a-a).
Judea was sometimes used as the name for the entire region, including parts beyond the river Jordan. In 200 CE Sextus Julius Africanus, cited by Eusebius ("Church History" 1.7.14), described "Nazara" (Nazareth) as a village in Judea.
Judea was the name in use in English until the Jordanian occupation of the area in 1948. Jordan called the area of Judea and Samaria "ad-difa’a al-gharbiya" (translated into English as the "West Bank"). "Yehuda" is the Hebrew term used for the area in modern Israel since the region was captured and occupied by Israel in 1967.
Historical boundaries.
The classical Roman-Jewish historian Josephus wrote: In the limits of Samaria and Judea lies the village Anuath, which is also named Borceos. This is the northern boundary of Judea. The southern parts of Judea, if they be measured lengthways, are bounded by a village adjoining to the confines of Arabia; the Jews that dwell there call it Jordan. However, its breadth is extended from the river Jordan to Joppa. The city Jerusalem is situated in the very middle; on which account some have, with sagacity enough, called that city the Navel of the country. Nor indeed is Judea destitute of such delights as come from the sea, since its maritime places extend as far as Ptolemais: it was parted into eleven portions, of which the royal city Jerusalem was the supreme, and presided over all the neighboring country, as the head does over the body. As to the other cities that were inferior to it, they presided over their several toparchies; Gophna was the second of those cities, and next to that Acrabatta, after them Thamna, and Lydda, and Emmaus, and Pella, and Idumea, and Engaddi, and Herodium, and Jericho; and after them came Jamnia and Joppa, as presiding over the neighboring people; and besides these there was the region of Gamala, and Gaulonitis, and Batanea, and Trachonitis, which are also parts of the kingdom of Agrippa. This country begins at Mount Libanus, and the fountains of Jordan, and reaches breadthways to the lake of Tiberias; and in length is extended from a village called Arpha, as far as Julias. Its inhabitants are a mixture of Jews and Syrians. And thus have I, with all possible brevity, described the country of Judea, and those that lie round about it.
Geography.
Judea is a mountainous region, part of which is considered a desert. It varies greatly in height, rising to an altitude of 1,020 m (3,346 ft) in the south at Mount Hebron, southwest of Jerusalem, and descending to as much as 400 m (1,312 ft) "below" sea level in the east of the region. It also varies in rainfall, starting with about in the western hills, rising to around western Jerusalem (in central Judea), falling back to in eastern Jerusalem and dropping to around 100 mm in the eastern parts, due to a rainshadow effect (this is the Judean desert). The climate, accordingly, moves between Mediterranean in the west and desert climate in the east, with a strip of steppe climate in the middle. Major urban areas in the region include Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Gush Etzion, Jericho and Hebron.
Geographers divide Judea into several regions: the Hebron hills, the Jerusalem saddle, the Bethel hills and the Judean desert east of Jerusalem, which descends in a series of steps to the Dead Sea. The hills are distinct for their anticline structure. In ancient times the hills were forested, and the Bible records agriculture and sheep farming being practiced in the area. Animals are still grazed today, with shepherds moving them between the low ground to the hilltops as summer approaches, while the slopes are still layered with centuries-old stone terracing. The Jewish Revolt against the Romans ended in the devastation of vast areas of the Judaean countryside.
History.
Early Iron Age.
By the Early Iron Age, around 1020 BCE, the Southern Levant came to be ruled by the Kingdom of Israel, and its successors, the Northern Kingdom and the Kingdom of Judah. The Northern Kingdom was conquered into the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 720 BCE. The Kingdom of Judah remained nominally independent, but paid tribute to the Assyrian Empire from 715 and throughout the first half of the 7th century BCE, regaining its independence as the Assyrian Empire declined after 640 BCE, but after 609 again fell under the sway of imperial rule, this time paying tribute at first to the Egyptians and after 601 BCE to the Neo-Babylonian Empire, until 586 BCE, when it was finally conquered by Babylonia.
Judea is central to much of the narrative of the Torah, with the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob said to have been buried at Hebron in the Tomb of the Patriarchs.
Persian and Hellenistic periods.
The Babylonian Empire fell to the conquests of Cyrus the Great in 539 BCE.
Judea remained under Persian rule until the conquest of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, eventually falling under the rule of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire until the revolt of Judas Maccabeus resulted in the Hasmonean dynasty of Kings who ruled in Judea for over a century.
Roman conquest.
Judea lost its independence to the Romans in the 1st century BCE, by becoming first a tributary kingdom, then a province, of the Roman Empire. The Romans had allied themselves to the Maccabees and interfered again in 63 BCE, at the end of the Third Mithridatic War, when the proconsul Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great") stayed behind to make the area secure for Rome. Queen Alexandra Salome had recently died, and a civil war broke out between her sons, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. Pompeius restored Hyrcanus but political rule passed to the Herodian family who ruled as client kings. In 6 CE, Judea came under direct Roman rule as the southern part of the province of Iudaea. Eventually, the Jews rose against Roman rule in 66 CE in a revolt that was unsuccessful. Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 CE and much of the population was killed or enslaved.
Bar Kokhba revolt.
The Jews rebelled again 70 years later under the leadership of Simon bar Kokhba and established the last Kingdom of Israel, which lasted three years, before the Romans managed to conquer the province for good, at a high cost in terms of manpower and expense.
After the defeat of Bar Kokhba (132–135 CE) the Roman Emperor Hadrian was determined to wipe out the identity of Israel-Judah-Judea, and renamed it Syria Palaestina. Until that time the area had been called "province of Judea" (Roman Judea) by the Romans. At the same time, he changed the name of the city of Jerusalem to "Aelia Capitolina". The Romans killed many Jews and sold many more into slavery; many Jews departed into the Jewish diaspora, but there was never a complete Jewish abandonment of the area, and Jews have been an important (and sometimes persecuted) minority in Judea since that time.

Rue Saint-Dominique

The rue Saint-Dominique is a street in the 7th arrondissement of Paris. It was formerly known as chemin de la Longue Raye (1355), chemin des Treilles (1433), chemin Herbu (des Moulins à Vent) (1523), chemin de l'Oseraie (1527), chemin du Port (1530), chemin des Vaches (1542), chemin de la Justice and chemin des Charbonniers. It was renamed rue Saint-Dominique in 1643 after the Dominican monastery set up a few years earlier near the eastern end of the street (now absorbed by the Boulevard Saint-Germain), whose only remnant is the église Saint-Thomas-d’Aquin on the place Saint-Thomas-d’Aquin (called place des Jacobins until 1802, after the Dominicans).
In 1670, Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes was born at number 33, called the "Hôtel de Luynes". It is now destroyed.

Argentine ant

The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (formerly "Iridomyrmex humilis"), is a dark ant native to northern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. It is an invasive species that has been established in many Mediterranean climate areas, inadvertently introduced by humans to many places, including South Africa, New Zealand, Japan, Easter Island, Australia, Hawaii, Europe, and the United States.
Description.
The worker ants are about long and can easily squeeze through cracks and holes no more than in size. Queens are two to four times the length of workers. These ants will set up quarters in the ground, in cracks in concrete walls, in spaces between boards and timbers, even among belongings in human dwellings. In natural areas, they generally nest shallowly in loose leaf litter or beneath small stones, due to their poor ability to dig deeper nests. However, if a deeper nesting ant species abandons their nest, Argentine ant colonies will readily take over the space.
German entomologist Dr. Gustav L. Mayr identified the first specimens of "Hypoclinea humilis" in the vicinity of Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1866. This species was shortly transferred to the genus "Iridomyrmex", and finally to "Linepithema" in the early 1990s. The Argentine Ant is often confused with a related species ant species, the Pharaoh Ant ("Monomorium pharaonis").
Distribution.
The native range of Argentine ants is limited to around major waterways in the lowland areas of the Paraná River drainage; They have recently spread into parts of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The species has become established in at least 15 countries throughout the world, on six continents, as well as many oceanic islands.
Global "mega-colony".
According to research published in "Insectes Sociaux" in 2009, it was discovered that ants from three Argentine ant supercolonies in America, Europe, and Japan, that were previously thought to be separate, were in fact most likely to be genetically related. The three colonies in question were one in Europe, stretching along the Mediterranean coast, the "Californian large" colony, stretching along the coast of California, and a third on the west coast of Japan.
Based on a similarity in the chemical profile of hydrocarbons on the cuticles of the ants from each colony, and on the ants' non-aggressive and grooming behaviour when interacting, compared to their behaviour when mixing with ants from other super-colonies from the coast of Catalonia in Spain and from Kobe in Japan, researchers concluded that the three colonies studied actually represented a single global super-colony.
The researchers stated that "enormous extent of this population is paralleled only by human society", and had probably been spread and maintained by human travel.
Behavior.
They have been extraordinarily successful, in part, because different nests of the introduced Argentine ants seldom attack or compete with each other, unlike most other species of ant. In their introduced range, their genetic makeup is so uniform that individuals from one nest can mingle in a neighboring nest without being attacked. Thus, in most of their introduced range, they form supercolonies. "Some ants have an extraordinary social organization, called unicoloniality, whereby individuals mix freely among physically separated nests. This type of social organization is not only a key attribute responsible for the ecological domination of these ants, but also an evolutionary paradox and a potential problem for kin selection theory because relatedness between nest mates is effectively zero." In contrast, native populations are more genetically diverse, genetically differentiated (among colonies and across space), and form colonies that are much smaller than the supercolonies that dominate the introduced range. Argentine ants in their native South America also co-exist with many other species of ants, and do not attain the high population densities that characterize introduced populations.
In a series of experiments, ants of the same colony were isolated and fed different diets. The hydrocarbons from the diet were eventually incorporated into the cuticle of the subjects. Those that had the same diet appeared to recognize one another as kin. Those who had at least some overlap in dietary composition also appeared to react non-aggressively to one another. These interactions contrasts drastically with the groups that fed on completely different sources, such as those who lived off flies and those that fed on grasshoppers. The groups appeared to have incorporated hydrocarbons that were not similar to the others and created an unfamiliar identity cue. These groups reacted violently towards each other. This suggests that dietary factors affect the recognition cues for colony members.
Reproduction and Seasonal Colony Trends.
Like workers in many other ant species, Argentine ant workers are unable to lay reproductive eggs but can direct the development of eggs into reproductive females; the production of males appears to be controlled by the amount of food available to the larvae. Argentine ant colonies almost invariably have many reproductive queens, as many as eight for every 1,000 workers. The queens seldom or never disperse in winged form. Instead, colonies reproduce by budding off into new units. As few as ten workers and a single queen can establish a new colony.
The seasonal low occurs in mid-winter, when 90% of a representative colony consisted of workers and the remainder of queens, and no reproductive activity and minimal birthing. Eggs are produced in late-winter, nearly all of which hatch into sexual forms by May. Mating occurs after the females emerge. Worker production increases steadily from mid-March to October, after which their numbers are not replenished; thus, their numbers drop steadily over the winter months.
Colonies in the Argentine ant’s native habitat are kept within a range of ten to one hundred meters by colonies of interspecific and intraspecific rivals. As the colonies expand, they appear to form fluctuating territory borders, which contract and expand on a seasonal and conditional basis. There is an expansive push outward in the summer months, with a retreating motion in the winter. This has to do with soil moisture and temperature conditions. At the edges of these borders are either rival Linepithema humile colonies or other obstacles that prevent further expansion, such as an inhospitable environment for nesting.
Impact.
The ants are ranked among the world's 100 worst animal invaders. In its introduced range, the Argentine ant often displaces most or all native ants. This can, in turn, imperil other species in the ecosystem, such as native plants that depend on native ants for seed dispersal, or lizards that depend on native ants for food. For example, the recent severe decline in coastal horned lizards in southern California is closely tied to Argentine ants displacing native ant species on which the lizards feed.
Argentine ants sometimes tend aphid colonies, and their protection of this plant pest can cause problems in agricultural areas by protecting plant pests from predators and parasitoids. In return for this protection, the ants benefit by feeding off an excretion known as honeydew. Thus, when Argentine ants invade an agricultural area, the population densities of these plant parasites increase and so too does the damage they cause to crops.
Pest control.
Argentine ants are a common household pest, often entering structures in search of food or water (particularly during dry or hot weather), or to escape flooded nests during periods of heavy rainfall. When they invade a kitchen, it is not uncommon to see two or three queens foraging along with the workers. Eliminating a single queen does not stop the colony's ability to breed.
Due to their nesting behavior and presence of numerous queens in each colony, it is generally impractical to spray Argentine ants with pesticides or to use boiling water as with mound building ants. Spraying with pesticides has occasionally stimulated increased egg-laying by the queens, compounding the problem. Pest control usually requires exploiting their omnivorous dietary habits, through use of slow-acting poison bait, which will be carried back to the nest by the workers, eventually killing all the individuals, including the queens. It may take four to five days to eradicate a colony in this manner.
Researchers from the University of California, Irvine, have developed a way to use the scent of Argentine ants against them. The exoskeletons of the ants are covered with a hydrocarbon-laced secretion. They made a compound that is different, but similar, to the one that coats the ants. If the chemical is applied to an ant, the other members of the colony will kill it. The chemical method may be effective in combination with other methods.
Another approach for a large scale control of the Argentine ant has been proposed by researchers from Japan, who showed that it is possible to disrupt its trails with synthetic pheromones. This has been confirmed in various later trials by a New Zealand-led team in Hawaii and by researchers from Victoria University of Wellington who showed that this approach is beneficial for other local ant species.

Susan Martin

Susan W. Martin is the president of Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan. When she took office on July 7, 2008, Martin became the first female president in the University’s 160 year history. Her initial appointment was for three years, and she holds a simultaneous appointment as full professor in the College of Business.
Early life.
Martin was raised in Croswell, Michigan, where she attended classes at a one-room schoolhouse with two outhouses and no running water. She received a B.S. degree in Public Speaking from Central Michigan University in 1971, before earning an M.B.A. (1976) and a Ph.D. (1988) in Accounting from Michigan State University. Martin was a member of Sigma Kappa Sorority at Central Michigan University from 1967-71.
Past positions.
Martin began her career as a secretary in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Texas at Austin. From there Martin moved to Michigan serving at Michigan State University and then working in government as Assistant Auditor General, Office of the Auditor General, Deputy State Treasurer, Bureau of Local Government Services and Commissioner of Revenue.
Martin then went back to higher education working at Grand Valley State University as Master of Science in Taxation Program Coordinator, Director, International Business Programs, Chair, Accounting and Taxation Department, Professor of Accounting and Taxation, Assistant & Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs, Special Assistant to the Provost, and Executive Associate Vice President of Academic Affairs.
Lastly, before coming to Eastern, Martin served as provost & vice-chancellor of academic affairs at the University of Michigan–Dearborn.
President of Eastern Michigan University.
During a press conference and reception on May 14, 2008, Martin announced that she had started the EMU Excellence Fund. As reported on Focus EMU, "Martin cast the first $10,000 and enthusiastically urged everyone present to contribute at least $1 to the fund, an action that drew applause."
On Thursday, November 20, 2008, Martin was formally inaugurated in a ceremony at Pease Auditorium with about 1,000 attendees.
Although her presidency has not been without controversies, Martin has been "seen by many as a stabilizing force on the Ypsilanti campus" after scandals forced her two immediate predecessors from office. According to AnnArbor.com, "Martin's personnel file, obtained though a FOIA request, reveals that her support among the board appears to have grown from 2008 to 2011." In a December 15, 2011 review, regent Beth Fitzsimmons wrote, "For the past decade I have never seen such positive discussion about and support for EMU."
2012 Reprimand.
On April 23, 2012, Martin, along with four EMU regents (Roy Wilbanks, Jim Stapleton, Floyd Clack and Beth Fitzsimmons), were in Washington, D.C. attending a Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges conference. Following the conference they attended an alumni reception, after which Martin met at a bar with Michael Ferens, an EMU alumnus and the president of the Washington, D.C. alumni chapter, as well as an unidentified board member from the Washington, D.C. alumni chapter, and an unidentified EMU staff member. The exact details of the discussion are unclear, but they discussed EMU's 1991 mascot change and the "Huron Restoration" chapter of the alumni association, previous plans for a Huron statue, and John A. Fallon and Samuel A. Kirkpatrick, Martin's predecessors as president, both of whom left amidst controversy. According to emails they exchanged the next day, in which they apologized to each other, Martin thought Ferens said "John Fallon is my man"—a comment to which she was sensitive because Fallon had recently been hired by Ball State University, bringing the Laura Dickinson murder back into the news—while Ferens did not think he had said that and indicated that if he had, it had been a slip of the tongue.
Martin subsequently described the incident, saying "I lost my temper with an alumni when our discussion turned to a particularly sad time in Eastern's history. As it turned out, we had misunderstood each other at the time and we apologized to each other in subsequent emails the next day for this misunderstanding." According to Ferens, "I mis-phrased a name in the conversation and that’s all it really was." Ferens subsequently characterized the issue as "a little miscommunication", and "a moment of intensity in a conversation" about the mascot change. Martin acknowledged that she "was drinking at the time that I lost my temper", and mentioned that she hadn't eaten, while Ferens stated that, "We sat down and had a glass of wine, but we didn’t have 15 glasses of wine. I did not witness any heavy drinking. I did not witness any spectacles."
In response to the incident the EMU Board of Regents officially reprimanded Martin on May 17:
We want you to be successful as the President of the University. It is, however, incumbent upon us to emphasize the severity of the incident and its potential impact as your role as a leader and symbol of the University. You must deal with this issue immediately. If there are any further incidents, you will leave us no alternative but to recommend to the board that your employment be terminated for just cause pursuant to Paragraph 16.1 of your employment agreement.
In an formal response to the Board of Regents, Martin defended her character:
I consider myself a 'hands-on' President even to the point of jumping onto the marching band platform when appropriate, rappelling 60 feet down Roosevelt Hall, being on call 24/7 with the Department of Public Safety and insisting on being informed about every serious incident on campus. I could not perform these duties and handle the rigors of this position if I had a serious health issue of any type as suggested by the May 17, letter. I will continue to devote my entire time and energy to the goals and metrics we have set to make Eastern thrive and grow. I am deeply committed to this University. I love Eastern and "bleed green".
Following the 2012 incident, Martin stated that, although she did not believe she had an alcohol problem, she would receive counseling as recommended by the Board of Regents. She also announced that she would donate her 2012 raise, $8,764, to on-campus alcohol education.
Leadership and public service activities.
Martin has served in various positions such as Board of Directors, St. Joseph Mercy Health System, Board of Directors, Ann Arbor SPARK, Chair, State of Michigan Hospital Finance Authority, member of IRS Commissioner’s Internal Revenue Service Advisory Committee (2002–2004), Appointed member of Electronic Tax Administration Advisory Committee (1998-2000), member of Tax Executive Committee (1997-2000)

Lance Hunter

Lance Hunter is a fictional character within the Marvel Comics' Universe. He first appeared in "Captain Britain Weekly" #19 (February 16, 1977) and was created by Gary Friedrich. Hunter is a Royal Navy Commander who became Director of S.T.R.I.K.E. before later gaining the rank of Commodore and becoming Joint Intelligence Committee Chair.
Publication history.
Created by Gary Friedrich, and first penciled by Herb Trimpe, Hunter made his debut in "Captain Britain Weekly" #19 on February 16, 1977. He was the UK, and S.T.R.I.K.E., counterpart to Marvel's Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.. Hunter continued to appear within the pages of "Captain Britain Weekly" throughout the rest of 1977 but would not appear on panel again until 30 years later in the "Civil War: Battle Damage Report" one-shot in 2007.
Fictional character biography.
After Tod Radcliffe, a Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies traitor; secretly working for the Red Skull, was exposed, Commander Lance Hunter introduced himself as the Director of S.T.R.I.K.E. to Nick Fury. The agents of S.T.R.I.K.E. and S.H.I.E.L.D. worked together to track down Red Skull's Nazi activities. It was then revealed that Red Skull had kidnapped the British Prime Minister, James Callaghan and had set a germ bomb over London to be detonated at midnight. Hunter, aided by Fury and the pairs respective superheroes; Captain Britain and Captain America, stopped the bomb which had been placed on the minute hand of the Big Ben and thwarted the Red Skull's plans.
Hunter aided Captain Britain in the capture of villain Lord Hawk, and took the injured hero to S.T.R.I.K.E. headquarters to recover. However, while there Captain Britain's spirit was summoned away by Merlin where he did battle with a monstrous giant. Injuries suffered in this spirit realm transferred to the Captain's real body. Hunter ordered the doctors to keep working to save the stricken hero. When Hunter finally admitted defeat at the bed side of Captain Britain's lifeless body, the Captain returned to the real world and left the base.
Sometime after S.T.R.I.K.E. was dissolved, Hunter gained the rank of Commodore and was seen alongside Contessa Valentina Allegro de Fontaine, and Alistaire Stuart briefing British superhumans on the details of the British Superhuman Registration Act. Following the Skrull invasion of Earth, and the revelation that the then-Joint Intelligence Committee chair person was in fact a Skrull impostor, Hunter was made the new JIC Chair.
Hunter agreed to let S.H.I.E.L.D. European Division take charge of the cleanup when Mys-Tech was defeated, as MI-13 didn't have the resources. He approved keeping MI-13 out of the loop entirely, which infuriated Pete Wisdom when he found out. 
Powers and abilities.
He also has years of Naval training, with an expertise in munitions, as well as experience in espionage from working for British Intelligence.

Rue La Boétie

The rue La Boétie is a street in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, running from rue d'Astorg to avenue des Champs-Élysées. It is named in honour of Étienne de La Boétie (1530-1563), friend of moralist Michel de Montaigne.
History.
From 1640, the space today found between the streets of the Colosseum and Berri, avenue des Champs-Élysées and the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré was occupied by the Royal nursery. This provided all the trees, shrubs and flowers for the Royal residences. Decommissioned under the Régence to make way for a subdivision planned by John Law, the plan was eventually dropped.
In 1755 the land became te property of the Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Saint-Florentin, who was then Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi, who ceded it in 1764 to his mistress, Marie-Madeleine de Cusacque the Countess of Langeac (1725-1778). She then sold it in 1772 to the Comte d'Artois, who later became Charles X of France, Louis XVI's younger brother.
Planning approval via Letters Patent was given on 29 November 1777, that allowed the Prince to break into the field from "rue d'Angoulême" with a width of , and to name it in honor of his eldest son Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême (1775-1844). New letters patent of 4 April 1778 approved the opening of the streets of Ponthieu, Neuve-de-Berri (current rue de Berri), new-de-Poitiers (current rue d'Artois) and Angoulême-Saint-Honoré. An alignment report was drawn up by the office of the City of Paris on 24 November 1778, allowing a ministerial decision to be taken on 27 December 1803 width set the width of the street to .
During the French Revolution and until 1815, the street bore the name "rue de l'Union" (Union Street). It then resumed its original name until 1830, when it became "rue de la Charte" (Street of the Charter). It then udertook a quick succession of names, becoming "rue Lapeyrouse", "rue d'Angoulême à nouveau" (1852), "rue de Morny" (1863), "rue de la Commune" (1871), rue Mac-Mahon and finally "rue Pierre-Charron" in 1871. The area between the place Saint-Augustin and the place Chand-Goyon was called "rue de la Pépinière" until 1868, and then "rue Abattucci".
The street took its current name in 1879, throughout its length, in honour of Étienne de La Boétie (1530-1563), friend moralist of Michel de Montaigne.

Suzuki LT250R

The Suzuki LT250R was a sport ATV manufactured between 1985 and 1992. It combined a lightweight frame and good handling, with a liquid cooled 250cc two-stroke engine. 
Commonly known as the Quadracer, it revolutionized the ATV industry. Before this model was released, the ATV world was dominated by three-wheelers. Although the four-stroke LT250E Quadrunner was released a year earlier, it was not well accepted by racing enthusiasts that were hesitant to adopt the heavier four-wheelers over their three-wheelers. Then came the LT250R.
Most of the advances made by Suzuki with this quad have been overshadowed by the Honda TRX250R, which was released in 1986. During these early years though, they were treated as equals, with the Honda being preferred by most because of its apparent handling characteristics. Even though both model names ended with "250R", the Honda walked away with the nickname.
The LT250R setup is what is commonly used in today's sport quads, such as:<br>
1985.
In an apparent attention to weight by engineers, it came with many aluminum parts: swing arm, rear axle carrier, engine cases, front spindles, rear shock link. But the overall advantage in weight (compared to most other quads) is the simplicity of design. The '85 and '86 Quadracers are known as the lightest production full size race quads ever built, tipping the scales at only 293 lbs dry making them similar to the 250cc two stroke race three wheelers of that era. (They were actually lighter than the Yamaha Tri-Z, slightly heavier than the Kawasaki Tecate 3, and identical in weight to the Honda ATC250R.)
In 85 the Suzuki LT250R QuadRacer became the first high-performance four-wheeler
1986.
Mostly the same as 1985 but with a Mikuni VM34SS carburetor. It also had a very slight modification to the decals, and had white letters on the seat spelling "Suzuki" instead of yellow letters used in '85.
1987.
"The beaner year", many different changes occurred within this production year, sometimes making parts hard to match up.
The major changes were in the frame, engine, swingarm, and a-arms. The most visible change is in the frame right in front of the cylinder the 85-86 frame has a single down bar, but the '87+ has a single wishbone down-tube. The 85-86 exhaust goes out the side of the cylinder and the '87+ goes straight out the front in between the split downbar, hence the head pipe design changed for '87+. For '87+, a head motor mount was added and connects the engine to the backbone of the frame (under tank). The 85-86 is also a non powervalved motor as the '87+ have powervalves (aka: "poor man's turbo-charger"). The front shocks are also about 3" longer than previous models. The air intake from the carburetor to the cylinder is in a 5 bolt pattern and larger than the other years providing more air flow. Hence, the 87's are desired by tuners and racers for the larger base air flow. The 1987-on LT250R and the LT250R's big brother, the LT500R or Quadzilla, used the 5-bolt intake design. Also the '87+ used a 6 speed transmission instead of the 5 speed used on the 85-86 models. The engine color was changed from silver used on the 85-86 models to blue for the '87+ models.
For the '87+ model, the swingarm design was changed to a more "beefy" design after cracking / breaking issues with the 85-86 swingarm design. Clearly, the Suzuki engineers underestimated how hard their customers could ride their product. However, the '87+ swingarm will mount to the 85-86 frame with some other minor equipment swap (i.e. rear shock, link). The '87+ rear axle carrier includes forward-reverse slide chain tensioning rather than the 85-86's rotary tensioning method. The '87+ carrier housing slides forward and reverse and then is held in place by four vertical bolts and two rear horizontal bolts whereas the 85-86 carrier was held with a clamp or pinch design.
The '87 and '88 rear axles continued to have 24 splines axles that were the same as the 85-86 models. In '89, this was changed to a 26 spline axle similar to the LT500R. The hubs on the 1987 models went to a 5/130 bolt pattern similar to the LT500R). This was in contrast to the 4/130 bolt pattern of 85-86. The front fenders are the same and will swap between any year. The rear fenders will swap between any year, but the '91 and '92 model years were different under the seat in order to access the air filter which was relocated due to the redesign of the rear suspension. The '91 and '92 rear plastic actually has a curved metal bar riveted under the seat to help support the plastic due to the larger void in the plastic moulding necessary to access the air filter. (Note that the original rear plastic for '85 - '90 is no longer available from Suzuki. All new rear plastic is the '91-92 style with the riveted bar under the seat.)
The seats changed drastically in '87. They flare out at the rear (like a "T") while the 85-86 has a straight seat. There are also some cosmetic differences between the seats of various years. '85 had yellow hollow letters spelling "Suzuki" on the sides. In '86, they changed these letters to white. On the "T" seat in '89, they added the words "QuadRacer" to the back in white letters. In '91 and '92, they added splashes of teal all throughout the blue seat in a "camo" type of pattern.
1988–1989.
88-92 changed from 5-bolt(87) 8-petal reed valve 6-bolt 6-petal reed valve.
1990–1992.
The 1991 model year brought about a different linkage in the rear suspension, similar to the LT500R. This necessitated the differences to the rear plastic under the seat as mentioned above.
They also came with rear heel guards that required a few minor changes to the frame, footpegs, and swingarm pivot bolt.

Villa di Quarto

The Villa di Quarto is a villa on via di Quarto in Florence, in the hilly zone at the foot of the Monte Morello. Quarto ("fourth") is one of the toponyms relating to the Roman milestones, the most famous of which in this area is Sesto Fiorentino, of 45,000 inhabitants.
History.
The villa was built in the 15th century and, after various changes of ownership, in 1613 it passed to the Pasquali family, who had it rebuilt by Alfonso Parigi, designer of the Boboli extension. In the 19th century the villa took on its present appearance - it then belonged to Jérôme Bonaparte, former king of Westphalia, who left it to his daughter Mathilde Bonaparte, wife of the Russian nobleman and industrialist Anatole Demidov. The villa's many famous guests included the French historian and statistician Adolphe Thiers, though its most famous resident- and certainly the resident who wrote most about his stay there- was the author Mark Twain.
Villa.
The building has a simple layout, with three floors on the hill side, while on the garden side there opens up a nineteenth-century loggia with three arches on twin columns, replacing an older eighteenth century arcade. The main entrance is located on the side hill, with large doors that lead to a hall enriched by marble busts and a frescoed vault. From the atrium starts monumental gray stone that leads to the first floor where the main saloon is located, the latter about 6 feet high, with vaulted and frescoed ceilings featuring nineteenth century motifs. This is connected to other rooms as grand and the gallery, running parallel to the terrace above the outside portico, from which is possible to enjoy the view of the large Italian garden and the great lawn of the English park. Currently, the house needs some structural and protective interventions in the outer parts.

Jon Ludvig Hammer

Jon Ludvig Nilssen Hammer (born 2 June 1990 in Bergen) is a Norwegian chess Grandmaster (GM). He completed all the requirements for the GM title in the beginning of 2009 and was awarded the title in March 2009. He is the reigning Norwegian Chess Champion, having won the title in July 2013. Hammer was the main second for Magnus Carlsen in the World Chess Championship 2013.
Hammer's strong results at a fairly young age have marked him as among Norway's greatest chess talents, but his achievements have to some degree been overshadowed by Magnus Carlsen. In 2007, Hammer completed all requirements for the International Master title. 
In the 38th Chess Olympiad in Dresden, Hammer represented Norway as the substitute player (number five on the team), played in all rounds except the first, and scored +4−2=4.
Hammer gained his first GM norm in Cappelle la Grande in 2007, the second in Denmark in 2008, and a third in European Club Championship for teams later that year. The short length of those tournaments, however, meant he needed a fourth norm to gain the GM title. This norm was achieved when Hammer won outright a jubilee tournament at Gjøvik arranged at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009. In the final round against Mateusz Bartel, Hammer would secure his Grandmaster title with a draw. In spite of this, he eschewed several opportunities for a perpetual check, and successfully took aim at sole first place.
Hammer scored a 2792 rating performance on Norway's top board during the 2009 European Team Chess Championship in Novi Sad, where his +4−0=5 score made him one of the top individual scorers.
In 2011, Hammer suffered setbacks in the "B" section of the Tata Steel Chess Tournament, and the Aeroflot Open. He rebounded with a good result in the Reykjavik Open, where he finished with 7/9, and in 5th place on tiebreaks. As the best Nordic player, Hammer became Norway's first Nordic Chess Champion since Simen Agdestein in 1992.
Hammer won his first Norwegian Chess Championship in 2013 when he scored 7/9 (+5−0=4). Hammer's best result until then had been the 2008 championship, when he finished equal on points with Frode Elsness, but he lost the September playoff to Elsness after losing the first game, and acquiescing to a draw in a worse position in the second. In 2013/14, Hammer took a clear first place with 7½/9 in the Rilton Cup.
Hammer attended the Norwegian sports academy Norwegian College of Elite Sport, and was coached by Agdestein. Hammer has been described as taking chess very seriously, playing very often online, in tournaments, or practicing. In 2009, Hammer announced he would not pursue a professional chess career, and he now studies economics.

<doc id="21492141" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21492141" title="Mobile CDN">
Mobile CDN

A mobile content delivery network or mobile content distribution network (Mobile CDN) is a network of servers - systems, computers or devices - that cooperate transparently to optimize the delivery of content to end users on any type of wireless or mobile network. Like traditional CDNs, the primary purpose of a Mobile CDN is to serve content to end users with high availability and high performance. In addition, Mobile CDNs can be used to optimize content delivery for the unique characteristics of wireless networks and mobile devices, such as limited network capacity, or lower device resolution. Added intelligence around device detection, content adaptation can help address challenges inherent to mobile networks which have high latency, higher packet loss and huge variation in download capacity.
Technology.
Mobile CDNs should integrate mobile delivery services that optimize the delivery of any kind of content including live video streaming, on demand video and the delivery of other content assets. In the case of video content, these services include device detection, image rendering, video transcoding and bit-rate adaptation. For the optimization of the delivery of other content, mobile CDNs use technologies such as caching. 
With currently available mobile CDN solutions, nodes are deployed at the edge of the network and in multiple locations, often over multiple backbones directly connected or peered with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). These nodes cooperate with each other to satisfy requests for content by end users, transparently moving content to optimize the delivery process. The benefits of optimization can take the form of reduced bandwidth usage, improved end-user performance, or increased global availability of content over a mobile network.
Industry experts speculate whether mobile CDNs will take off due to technical and market issues. CDNs are important for mobile operators as they can lead to significant savings and avoid network congestion. However, a number of network-centric alternatives have been proposed including fast dormancy, increasing bandwidth capacity with upgrades to 4G/LTE, and offloading traffic to other networks such as Wi-Fi.

List of politicians, lawyers, and civil servants educated at Jesus College, Oxford

Jesus College is one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford in England. The college was founded in 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I at the request of Hugh Price, a Welsh clergyman, who was Treasurer of St David's Cathedral in Pembrokeshire. The college still has strong links with Wales, and about 15% of students are Welsh. There are 340 undergraduates and 190 students carrying out postgraduate studies. Women have been admitted since 1974, when the college was one of the first five men's colleges to become co-educational. Old members of Jesus College are sometimes known as "Jesubites".
Harold Wilson studied at Jesus College from 1934 to 1937, and was later the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during two periods (from October 1964 to June 1970, and from March 1974 to April 1976). More than 30 other Members of Parliament (MPs) have been educated at the college, from Sir John Salusbury who was elected as MP for Denbighshire in 1601 to Theresa Villiers who was elected as MP for Chipping Barnet in 2005. Sir Leoline Jenkins, who became a Fellow and later the Principal of the college, was Secretary of State for the Northern Department from 1680 to 1681 and Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1681 to 1685. Sir William Williams served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1680 to 1685 and as Solicitor General for England and Wales from 1687 to 1689. Evan Cotton was MP for Finsbury East before holding the position of President of the Bengal Legislative Council from 1922 to 1925. Several Welsh politicians have been educated at the college, some representing constituencies in Wales (such as Sir John Wogan, representing Pembrokeshire at various times between 1614 and 1644) and others working outside Parliament, such as D. J. Williams, a co-founder of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru.
Other students at the college have subsequently held political offices in other countries. Norman Washington Manley was Chief Minister of Jamaica from 1955 to 1962. P. T. Rajan was Chief Minister of Madras Presidency between April and August 1936. Heather Wilson was the first Old Member of the college to sit in the United States House of Representatives, where she represented New Mexico's 1st congressional district from 1998 to 2009. The Australian politician Neal Blewett was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1977 to 1994, a Government Minister from 1983 to 1994 and High Commissioner to the UK from 1994 to 1998. Pixley ka Isaka Seme, who studied for a BCL between 1906 and 1909, was one of the founder members of the African National Congress.
Several prominent judges and lawyers were educated at the college. Viscount Sankey, who was Lord Chancellor from 1929 to 1935, studied for a BA in History and BCL between 1885 and 1891. Lord du Parcq was appointed as a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary in 1946. Sir Richard Richards became Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1817. The Scottish MP and lawyer Lord Murray was appointed a Senator of the College of Justice in 1979. The solicitor Sir David Lewis was Lord Mayor of the City of London from 2007 to 2008. Other lawyers who studied at the college include James Chadwin QC, who defended the Yorkshire Ripper, and Sir Arthur James, who prosecuted the Great Train Robbers and later became a judge of the Court of Appeal. Academic lawyers include J Duncan M Derrett, Professor of Oriental Laws in the University of London from 1965 to 1982, and Alfred Hazel, Reader in English Law at All Souls College, Oxford.
Alumni.
The subject studied and the degree classification are included, where known. Until the early 19th century, undergraduates read for a Bachelor of Arts degree that included study of Latin and Greek texts, mathematics, geometry, philosophy and theology. Individual subjects at undergraduate level were only introduced later: for example, Mathematics (1805), Natural Science (1850), Jurisprudence (1851, although it had been available before this to students who obtained special permission), Modern History (1851) and Theology (1871). Geography and Modern Languages were introduced in the 20th century. Music had been available as a specialist subject before these changes; medicine was studied as a post-graduate subject.

George Taylor (gardener)

George Taylor (February 12, 1803 − August 21, 1891) was an award-winning nurseryman from Scotland who emigrated to Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1855. There, he became known as George "Celery" Taylor because he introduced commercial celery growing to the United States.
Early life.
George Taylor was born in the Scottish Borders on 12 February 1803. His parents were Andrew Taylor, a shepherd, and Violet Stevenson. As a child, Taylor had to watch over the sheep, often snaring rabbits and hares illegally to sell for one shilling and sixpence each, wages for a whole day’s work in those days. His parents were literate and he could already read the Bible when he started school aged seven.
Working life.
Even though he only had a few years of schooling he was an educated man with a great love of books. He used to walk the fifty miles to Edinburgh, which took him fourteen hours, to spend his money on books rather than pay the coach fare.
He learned his trade as a market gardener and in 1846 he became manager of a plant nursery in Kelso. He worked there successfully for nine years.
Religion and temperance.
He was a deeply religious man at a time when there was much upheaval in the Church of Scotland. He followed Thomas Chalmers at the time of the Disruption of 1843 to form the Free Church of Scotland. After seeing families destroyed by drink, he became involved in the Temperance movement which was growing in Britain at that time. He became vice-president of the Temperance Society in Kelso. His faith also made him speak up against slavery.
United States of America.
In 1855, aged 53, he took his family to the United States and settled in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where his brothers were already living. There, he started a gardening business and had many plants and trees shipped from Scotland. It was there that he introduced commercial celery growing to the United States, an achievement remembered on a plaque in Kalamazoo. He gave several addresses to the Horticultural Society of Michigan on hedging and forestry, stressing the need for planting for the future.
Travel.
He was a well-travelled man who journeyed through Scotland, England, Ireland and the United States by rail. He made his first train journey in 1843 to Ayrshire then to the Trossachs where he met and travelled with Newman Hall (Christopher Newman Hall, known as the Dissenter’s Bishop, who was a notable English Nonconformist). Taylor’s first sea voyage was to the United States in 1855. In spite of the first sailing ship nearly sinking off Ireland, he returned to Scotland in 1862 and again in 1874, crossing the Atlantic five times in all. On his train travels he visited the Great Exhibition in London in 1851, the Niagara Falls, Washington and saw the ruins of Chicago a few days after the Great Fire in 1871.
Family.
George Taylor had four wives and six children. Three others died at birth. He married: 
His children were Isabella, Andrew who drowned aged 19, James, Violet, George and John.
George Taylor died in Kalamazoo on 21 August 1891.

The Knesset list was topped by Wolpe, Marzel and Israeli musician Ariel Zilber. In the weeks prior to the election, the joint list agreed to run as part of the National Union list, with Michael Ben-Ari, its representative, taking the 4th spot on the alliance's list. The Union won four seats, allowing Ben-Ari to enter the Knesset.
On 27 October 2010, violence broke out at the town of Umm al-Fahm between Eretz Yisrael Shelanu marchers and Arab counter-protesters.
In 2012, Ben-Ari and Arie Eldad of Hatikva, another member party of the National Union, announced their decision to leave the alliance and form Otzma LeYisrael.

February 2009 Kabul raids

The February 2009 Kabul raids were a series of strikes by the Taliban against Afghan government targets in Kabul, Afghanistan on February 11, 2009. The attacks killed 21 and injured 57. The attacks happened the day before the new American envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, was due to arrive in the country.
Eight Taliban fighters were involved in the assault, and all were killed. Five Taliban stormed the Justice Ministry building, killing two guards then laying siege to the building for about an hour. About ten people died in the fighting there. At the Directorate of Prisons, one attacker blew himself up at a checkpoint and the other ran inside the building and blew himself up, killing seven and injuring 15. One attacker was killed before he could attack the Education Ministry building.
The Taliban claimed the attacks, saying they were revenge for the killing of prisoners at the Pul-i-Charkhi Prison. Afghan officials said the mastermind of the attack was based in Pakistan, based on intercepted text messages. An American official blamed fighters loyal to Jalaluddin Haqqani.
On March 18, officials from Afghanistan's National Directorate for Security announced that they had arrested seven men and killed an eighth in Kabul and Logar province who had been involved in planning and conducting the raid. Sayed Ansari, a spokesman for the directorate, stated that the assailants were believed to have trained in Pakistan and communicated with Pakistani-based handlers before and during the assaults.
Ansari stated that an Afghan man, named Mohammad Haris, had helped organize the raid in Waziristan, Pakistan, perhaps with assistance from Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate. Ansari added that the attackers were equipped with a megaphone, enough food for several days, and cellphones to keep in touch with each other and with their mastermind in Pakistan.

<doc id="21492287" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21492287" title="København (ship)">
København (ship)

København was a Danish five-masted barque used as a naval training vessel until its disappearance after December 22, 1928. Built by the Danish East Asiatic Company in 1921, it was the world's largest sailing ship at the time, and primarily served for sail training of young cadets.
The "København" was last heard from on December 21, 1928 while en route from Buenos Aires to Australia. When it became clear the ship was missing, a lengthy search ensued, but turned up no trace. The disappearance has become one of the greatest maritime mysteries of the modern era, and led to much speculation about the ship's ultimate fate.
Description.
The "København" was built by the firm of Ramage and Fergusson at Leith in Scotland (number 256), begun in 1913 but not completed until March 24, 1921. It was constructed for the Danish East Asiatic Company as a sail training ship. Known as the "Big Dane", it was the largest sailing ship in the world when completed. It was 430 feet long and grossed 3,965 tons; its five masts stood nearly 20 stories high with sails spanning a total of 56,000 square feet. It had an auxiliary diesel motor as well as a wireless transmitter. The figurehead was a carving of a helmeted Bishop Absalon.
Primarily intended for training young cadets seeking an officer's license, the ship offset some of its costs by carrying limited amounts of cargo on its voyages. Baron Nils Juel-Brockdorff oversaw the ship's construction and subsequently served as its first captain. From 1921 to 1928 the ship made nine voyages, visiting nearly every continent and completing two circumnavigations.
Disappearance.
On September 21, 1928, the "København" departed from Nørresundby in Northern Jutland for Buenos Aires on its tenth, and ultimately final, voyage. The captain was Hans Andersen; 75 persons were aboard, including 26 crew and 45 cadets. The goal was to unload a shipload of chalk and bagged cement in Buenos Aires, take on another load of cargo and sail for Melbourne, and then bring a shipment of Australian wheat back to Europe.
The "København" arrived at Buenos Aires on November 17, 1928, impressing the locals, in particular emigrant Danes. The cargo was unloaded, however departure was delayed as there were no paying commissions to take cargo to Australia. Finally, on December 14, Captain Andersen decided to ship out for Australia without a cargo. The voyage was expected to take 45 days. On December 22 the "København" exchanged radio messages with the Norwegian steamer "William Blumer", indicating they were about 900 miles from Tristan da Cunha and that "all is well". The "Blumer" attempted to contact the "København" again later that night, to no avail. The ship was never heard from again.
Search and legacy.
Due to the length of the voyage to Australia, and the fact that Andersen routinely went long periods without sending a message, the Danish were not initially worried. However, concern mounted as months passed without word. In April 1929 the Danish East Asiatic Company dispatched a motor vessel, the "Mexico", to Tristan da Cunha. Residents reported having seen a large five-masted ship with its foremast broken on January 21, 1929; however it had not attempted to come to the island. The "Mexico", joined by the British Royal Navy, searched for the "København" for several months, but found no sign. The Danish government declared the ship and its crew were lost at sea.
A number of theories for the "København"'s disappearance have been advanced. The most commonly accepted is that the ship struck an iceberg in the dark or fog. If so, the ship may have sunk too quickly for the crew to react. The lack of wreckage found later may have been the result of the ship's particularly secure loading and rigging, a necessity against the strong winds known as the Roaring Forties. An alternate theory is that the ship, which was in ballast with no cargo, may have been capsized by heavy winds, disabling the lifeboats for survivors. 
For the next two years after the "København"'s disappearance there were a number of sightings of a mysterious five-masted ship fitting its description in the Pacific, fueling further speculation about the vessel. Early reports came from Chilean fisherman, then in July 1930, the crew of an Argentine freighter sighted a five-masted "phantom ship" during a gale. The captain took their statements and wondered if this was the "wraith of the Copenhagen". Further sightings came in the following weeks from Easter Island and the Peruvian coast. Later some wreckage, including a piece of stern bearing the name "København", reportedly was found off West Australia.
Tentative evidence for the ship continued to emerge. In 1934 "The New York Times" reported that a "København" cadet's diary had been found in a bottle on Bouvet Island in the South Atlantic. The supposed diary indicated that the ship had been destroyed by icebergs and abandoned, the crew taking their chances in lifeboats. In 1935, human remains and the remains of a lifeboat were found partly buried in the sand along the southwest coast of Africa. These may have come from "København".
In 2012, divers found a wreck off the south west coast of Tristan da Cunha. The wreck has not yet been identified. The island's authorities are working with the Danish Maritime Museum, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Danish East Asiatic Company to work out if this is the "København."

Dividers is an outdoor sculpture located at Clarendon Dock, on the River Lagan, Belfast, Northern Ireland. It was produced in 2002 by artist Vivien Burnside and is an 8.3m tall set of dividers made of bronze with a stainless steel core. The sculpture stands as an archway or frame as the viewer looks inwards to the changing city or outwards to the sea. Dividers, in connecting points, allude to communication and navigation intrinsic to the Clarendon Dock area. It was funded by Laganside Corporation, Belfast Harbour Commissioners and the National Lottery through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
Vivien Burnside has talked about the ‘poetic ambiguity’ in the word Dividers. Here, at the edge of the dock, the form of the sculpture acts as a frame or doorway in the space, both entrance and exit, and provides a symmetrical, linear shape among a great many blocks of buildings, echoing the Harland and Wolff Samson and Goliath cranes on the other side of the River Lagan.

Ben-Ari grew up in the Kfar Shalem neighbourhood in south Tel Aviv, born to Mizrahi Jewish parents from Iran and Afghanistan. He studied at the Bnei Akiva yeshiva at Kfar Haroeh, at the hesder yeshiva in Yamit, and at the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva. As part of his hesder army service, he was with the Nahal settlement at Neve Dekalim from 1982 to 1986. He studied education at Bar-Ilan University, gaining a BA, before studying the Talmud for a Master's degree, and the Land of Israel for a PhD. He was a rabbi teacher at the Darchei No'am Yeshiva in Petach Tikva as well as the Bnei Akiva Yeshiva in Giv'at Shmuel.
Ben-Ari lives in the Israeli settlement of Karnei Shomron. His brother, Herzl Ben-Ari, is the head of the Karnei Shomron Local Council.
Political career.
Previously a member of the banned Kach party, Ben-Ari still views himself as Meir Kahane's follower. He ran with the Herut - The National Movement party in the 2003 elections, and for the 2006 elections, he ran with the Jewish National Front party, but both times failed to be elected since the parties did not pass the threshold. Leading up to the 2009 elections, the Jewish National Front joined a new party called Eretz Yisrael Shelanu. That new alliance then joined the National Union, and Ben-Ari was placed fourth on the combined list for the elections. He entered the Knesset as the party won four seats. Once elected, he appointed Hebron residents and Kahanists Baruch Marzel and Itamar Ben-Gvir as his aides in the Knesset.
In 2009, in an open letter to Israeli leaders and politicians, Ben-Ari stated that Pope Benedict XVI's visit to Israel would be an insult to the memory of Holocaust victims.
Unlike his teacher, Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was marginalized and isolated as a member of Knesset, Ben Ari has succeeded in integrating himself into Israel's political arena. He interacts with and is respected by his peers and has enjoyed wide cooperation in some of his parliamentary efforts.
Ben-Ari's November 2009 United States visa application was denied on the grounds of his arrest during anti-disengagement protests in 2005 and his support for Kahanist ideology.
Ben Ari opened his external Member of Knesset office in the south Tel Aviv neighborhood in which he grew up. Throughout the 18th Knesset session, he struggled to bring attention to the growing number of Sudanese whom he blamed for increasing crime rates and causing other problems for local residents. In June 2011, to draw attention to what he saw as the growing illegal alien problem, he bused 40 Sudanese nationals to a prestigious pool in northern Tel Aviv, provided them with new bathing suits and paid for their entrance.
Ben-Ari's 2012 visa application to attend a conference in D.C. was denied on the State Department's "prerogative to ban terrorists from entering the country." 
In July 2012, all Members of Knesset were sent a copy of the New Testament by a missionary organization. Ben Ari called it provocative, and subsequently tore his copy, referring to it as a despicable book responsible for the murder of millions of Jews, and which should, including the senders, be put in "history's trash can". 
In November 2012 Ben-Ari and Aryeh Eldad left the National Union to establish Otzma LeYisrael. Ben-Ari and Eldad publicly burned Palestinian flags in response to the passage of United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19. The party failed to cross the 2% threshold in the 2013 elections and Eldad subsequently lost his Knesset seat.
Arrest.
On 1 June 2009, Ben-Ari was handcuffed and arrested after being involved in an incident near Yitzhar in the West Bank, and despite his parliamentary immunity as Member of Knesset. He climbed onto an army truck and refused to get off, demanding that the Israel Border Police and Israel Defense Forces soldiers explain to him why they had arrested and handcuffed minors at a roadblocking protest. Knesset speaker Reuven Rivlin called the police commissioner and clarified that the police has no authority to arrest an MK without his approval. Yitzhak Aharonovich, the Internal Security Minister, justified the arrest, despite Ben Ari's parliamentary immunity, saying that he will not let MKs violate the law. Ben-Ari's response was to suggest that Aharonovich first verify the facts before coming to conclusions. The IDF Spokesman’s office started an investigation into whether the IDF and Border Guard acted illegally in their treatment of Ben-Ari. On 16 June, the Knesset Committee discussed Ben-Ari's arrest. While the semantics of the word 'arrest' were discussed, it was confirmed that Ben-Ari was not incarcerated. It was reported that a letter from the Chief of General Staff's office stated that the IDF expects elected officials and public representatives not to fan the flames and to abide by instructions from the security forces. Chairman of the committee, Ze'ev Elkin from Likud, criticized the Ministry of Defense for boycotting the meeting and not sending representatives.

National Highway 34 (India)

National Highway 34 or NH 34 runs from Dum Dum in north Kolkata to Dalkhola, where it meets NH 31, which connects it to Siliguri, several towns in north Bengal and the North-East. It is the main link of the districts of North 24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Maldah, and Uttar Dinajpur with the state capital, as well as north Bengal and the North-East.
It meets Belghoria Expressway connecting it to NH 2 near Madhyamgram, NH 35 at Barasat, the Panagarh–Morgram Highway at Morgram, NH 81 at Ingraj Bazar and NH 80 at Farrakka.
Total length of NH 34 is .

Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary and Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary are located near NH 34.
Rivers.
It crosses the River Churni near Ranaghat, Jalangi River near Krishnanagar, the Bhagirathi near Baharampur and the Ganges over the Farrakka Barrage.
Development programme.
National Highways Authority of India had taken up a mammoth project of widening and developing NH 34. Funded primarily by the Asian Development Bank, the project cost was pegged at Rs. 2,000 crore. According to the project plans, the existing two-lane highway was to be widened into a four-lane high-speed corridor.However, as of January 2009, the national highway has been in a terrible state for several years now, with National Highways Authority of India and state public works department locked in a dispute over who should maintain the crucial link to north Bengal and the North-East. The state government has also been unable to acquire land for converting the two-lane road into a four-lane expressway.

Emergency medical services in New Zealand

Emergency medical services in New Zealand (more commonly known as Ambulance) are provided by the Order of St John, except in the Greater Wellington region where Wellington Free Ambulance provides these services. Both have a history of long service to their communities, St John since 1885 and Wellington Free beginning in 1927, traditionally having a volunteer base which continues to this day however the vast majority of response work is undertaken by paid career Paramedics. Strategic leadership of the sector is provided by NASO (the National Ambulance Sector Office) which is a unit within the Ministry of Health responsible for coordinating the purchasing and funding of services on behalf of the Ministry and the Accident Compensation Corporation.
Funding occurs by means of billing part-charges for medical callouts (except Wellington Free) and charitable funding such as donations, bequests and corporate sponsorship to supplement Government funding. In recent years, the government has begun to examine more sustainable funding for ambulance services. however there is still significant exertion within the sector that the level of funding provided falls far below what is required to cover the actual cost of service delivery 
Organisation.
Since the age of the motor vehicle many Hospital Boards ran their own services. From 1957 to 1990 the Hospital Act stipulated that Hospital Boards had to provide an ambulance service. Many contracted that out to St John or had ad hoc arrangements with them, often for after hours staffing. When the Hospital Act was replaced by Health Boards, many of these Boards saw this as a chance to avoid being responsible and subsequently St John took over from many Boards (e.g. Thames, Bay of Plenty, Wanganui, Palmerston North, Waipawa, Dannevirke, Nelson, West Coast, Ashburton, Southland). Marlborough stayed a Hospital based service until 2007 and Taranaki until 2011. Wairarapa was the last region with a hospital-based service, ceasing in March 2012 and being taken over by Wellington Free Ambulance.
While both land ambulance service providers do have paid staff, they also rely very heavily on volunteer members. In most cases, paid staff tend to be concentrated in urban areas and in the management of rural areas, with rural response staff being largely volunteer-based. St. John Ambulance reports a total of 2,211 paid staff in New Zealand, supplemented by 7,647 volunteers. By contrast, Wellington Free Ambulance currently staffs 108 paid paramedics and 35 volunteers, not including the 21 paid staff and 21 auxiliary (volunteer) staff previously from the Wairarapa DHB service.
Land ambulance.
St. John provides service to approximately 88 percent of the population of New Zealand and 17 district heath boards (DHBs), through a network of 553 ambulances and 183 ambulance stations. St. John Ambulance reports the completion of approximately 274,108 emergency responses for the year ending 1 July 2008. By contrast, Wellington Free Ambulance provides service to 12 percent of the population of New Zealand and three district health boards (Capital & Coast, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa), providing service to more than 500,000 residents. They respond to an estimated 40,000 calls per year.
Air ambulance.
[[File:Otago Rescue Helicopter Dunedin Public Hospital.ogg|thumb|right|Otago Rescue Helicopter at Dunedin Public Hospital
Air ambulance and helicopter rescue services are vital given the low population density of New Zealand and the significant distances between tertiary hospitals. There are a large number of operators with all being sponsored by a commercial entity and bearing its name for marketing purposes; for example Auckland, Waikato and Wellington helicopters are sponsored by the Westpac Banking Corporation and branded as "Westpac Rescue" while others include the Taranaki Energy Rescue Helicopter, Square Trust Rescue Helicopter, Bay Trust Rescue Helicopter etc. Clinical crew (typically Intensive Care Paramedics) for the helicopter are drawn from the local road ambulance provider (St John) except in Auckland where the Trust employs its own Paramedics and Wellington, where Wellington Free Ambulance Intensive Care Flight Paramedics are covering the helicopter 24/7. Domestic fixed wing air ambulance services are typically use pressurised and converted Fairchild Metro aircraft, equipped as flying Intensive Care units. and it has been estimated that after corporate sponsorship and government subsidy, it is necessary to raise approximately NZ$2,500 (around US$1,400 in 2009) in donations for each mission.
New Zealand Fire Service.
The New Zealand Fire Service provides a medical 'First Response' in smaller communities where there is no local Ambulance service, as well as in the main centres when an Ambulance is unavailable or will be significantly delayed in attending an incident.
As of Christmas 2013 the New Zealand Fire Service 'Co- Responds' to all Code Purple (typically cardiac or respiratory arrest) emergences St John Ambulance attends nationwide.
The standard New Zealand Fire Service response to a medical emergency is one Fire Appliance equipped with an Automated external defibrillator.
Military.
The New Zealand Defence Force has personnel and equipment available at short notice to assist in civilian matters including medical emergencies.
Models of care.
The New Zealand system functions on the Anglo-American model of care, with most care in the pre-hospital setting being conducted by paramedics. Other practitioners, including local physicians and midwives, do appear at calls from time to time, but spend much less time responding to emergency calls than the Franco-German model.
Clinical Education.
The clinical education of Ambulance staff in New Zealand historically draws parallels to the Anglo-American development of the Paramedic profession generally but has undergone radical transformation in the past decade closely mirroring developments pursued by nations such as Australia, South Africa, Canada and the United Kingdom
Historical (pre-1977).
Prior to 1977 the "training" of Ambulance Officers was arranged in an ad-hoc fashion to a varying degree of first aid preparation to enable passage of a national examination administered on behalf of the Department of Health by an Examination Board of the Order of St John; a requirement established by the Ambulance Transport Advisory Board in 1963. Despite the content of this examination being described as "very basic" the requirement for some degree of formal Ambulance Officer education and training is one of the earliest in the world; in contrast the Ambulance Service of New South Wales established the Ambulance Education Centre at Rozelle (Sydney) in 1961 - although the first graduates were not until 1966, Geelong & Districts Ambulance in Victoria (Australia) began a training school in 1962 and the Province of Ontario (Canada) implemented a requirement for a five week, 160 hour "Fundamentals of Casualty Care" course for ambulance attendants in 1967.
Into the 1970s there was considerable development of local training amongst ambulance services over-and-above the basic DOH/ATAB requirement; this training particularly focussed on defibrillation to treat cardiac arrest and was most notable in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland; with Auckland introducing the first Mobile Intensive Care (Life Support Unit) on the North Shore in 1970 however other subjects covered included the administration of entonox (nitrous oxide) for pain relief and the taking of a patients blood pressure. The introduction of out-of-hospital defibrillation by civilian Paramedics to New Zealand (1970) is again among the earliest examples in the world; predated only by the original 1966 Pantridge Experiment in Belfast (Northern Ireland) and its earliest direct replication projects by the Miami Fire Department ("Rescue 1" in March 1967 under Dr. Eugene Nagel) and New York City with the Mobile Coronary Care Unit established by Dr. William Grace of St. Vincents Hospital) also introduced in 1967.
National Ambulance Officers Training School (1977-1999).
The National Ambulance Officers Training School (NAOTS) was established in 1977 using funds raised from the earlier 1975 Telethon and was administered by the Auckland Centre Trust Board of the St John Ambulance Association to fulfill its requirement to the Government (through the Ambulance Transport Advisory Board) to establish a national system of training for Ambulance Officers. NAOTS formalised training into three distinct levels of "Ambulance Aid" with each was a Certificate issued jointly by the Department of Health (through the ATAB) and the National Training School under the auspices of the Order of St John.
Walton and Offenberger compiled a review of the NAOTS (and Ambulance Officer training generally) for the Department of Health in 1984 which led to the following reforms:
The review also consideration the necessity of using qualified Ambulance Officers when undertaking non-emergency transfer duties; this can be seen today as the Patient Transport Service whereby transfers of non-emergent patients between hospitals, clinics and home are provided by staff who have only minimal clinical training (First Responder) as this is the need dictated by their duties. It was recommended that the Ambulance qualifications offered through NAOTS be recognised by the Authority for Advanced Vocational Awards (AAVA).
With the Bolger led National Government reforms of the 1990s; the New Zealand Qualifications Authority was established to replace the AAVA and by 1996 the NAOTS certifications were shifted onto the newly established Nationals Qualifications Framework thus became formal vocational qualifications of higher learning. Proficiency Ambulance Aid was replaced by the National Certificate in Ambulance (Patient Care and Transport) while the National Diploma in Ambulance (Paramedic) replaced both Post-Proficiency Modules (Intermediate Aid) as well as Advanced Aid however in practice the Intermediate Aid qualification was still offered as two Unit Standards from the Diploma.
The National Training School closed in 1999 as it had "become dysfunctional" and the recently introduced Ambulance Education Council considered that a drive towards regional service-led training was best 
thus began a decade of inconsistency within clinical education, although not as great as to return to the pre-NAOTS era of splintification.
Post NAOTS (1999-2008).
Following closure of the National Training School and disbanding of the New Zealand Ambulance Board which had previously published the National Authorised Patient Care Procedures each service took on responsibility for its own clinical education and standing orders (patient care procedures) which would further aggravate regional differences and ultimately, help lead a return to nationalised clinical education. 
In 1999 a program of "Intermediate Care Upskilling" was introduced by St John (initially in the Auckland District ) to equip selected ICOs with adrenaline, morphine, naloxone and (at the time) metoclopramide. This distinct training package was not part of any formal qualification. St John also merged the two Post-Proficiency modules back into one education program at some point during this time so that an officer became qualified in both portions of Intermediate Aid concurrently. Wellington Free Ambulance chose to adhere to the original Post-Proficiency module design thus retaining two distinct practice levels (cardiac and IV/cardiac). They also developed their own upskilling program known as "advanced life support" consisting of two modules, A and B; module A contained cardiac arrest drugs (at the time adrenaline, atropine and lignocaine) while Module B provided intravenous pain relief along with naloxone and metoclopramide.
To coincide with introduction of the various upskilling packages in the early 2000s there was a move away from the once nationally consistent qualification titles (Ambulance Officer, Intermediate Care Officer, Advanced Care Officer (Paramedic)) that existed under the National Training School to the introduction of new titles into each of the services. St John renamed Intermediate Care Officer to "Paramedic" and Paramedic (ACO) to "Advanced Paramedic" in 2001 along with a new national uniform. Wellington Free Ambulance chose to rename all staff qualified at National Certificate (Proficiency) or Intermediate Aid to "Paramedic" and their Paramedics (ACOs) to "Intensive Care Paramedic". There is anecdotal suggestion that the renaming of staff who did not hold the full National Diploma/Advanced Aid to "Paramedic" was due in part to the high media profile of programs such as Third Watch and Rescue 911 which glorified and glamorised the role of "Paramedic" thus giving the public an expectation that they, as on TV, should be attended to by a "Paramedic". It has also been recorded that the move to rename Intermediate Care Officer to "Paramedic" on the part of St John was somewhat motivated by their desire to expedite contract negotiations with the Ministry of Health and ACC which required a certain number of "Paramedics" however it can be logically assumed that the contract did not actually define what a "Paramedic" was, as the original definition of a Paramedic in New Zealand was somebody qualified to National Diploma/Advanced Care level.
With the demise of NAOTS; Auckland Institute of Technology, having been awarded University status and renamed Auckland University of Technology, developed the Bachelor of Health Science (Paramedic) degree while Victoria University (Melbourne) partnered with Wellington Free Ambulance to create a tertiary Paramedic degree administered through Whitireia Community Polytechnic. In 2003 St John began to require completion of the Bachelor of Health Science (Paramedic) for those staff who wished to moved to the Advanced Life Support (Advanced Aid) qualification level. Wellington Free introduced an "Intern Paramedic" position in 2004 to accommodate staff who would completing the Degree while also working on the road at the same time.
By the late 2000s there was a need to once again bring reform to clinical education; and although not as marked as those introduced during the time of the National Training School the following issues needed urgent attention 
The 2007 Health Select Committee report into the provision of ambulance services and the resulting National Ambulance Service Strategy included requirements to "achieve national consistency" in ambulance education and scope of practice (clinical competency) . St John had during this time developed a draft "Operations Competency Framework" which would become the foundation of more recent developments; specifically the replacement of the National Certificate, the requirement for all the various intermediate level officers to transition to a new "Paramedic" level which would approximate the "Upskilled Paramedic (ALS-A/ALS-B)" levels and become a Degree course, the development <refof a Post-Graduate program for Advanced Life Support (Advanced Aid) and the introduction of a mandatory program of continuing clinical education.
Current System (2008-present).
National Diploma.
In 2008 the National Diploma in Ambulance Practice (Level 5) replaced the National Certificate in Ambulance Patient Care and Transport (Level 4) as the qualification for the basic life support level.
The Diploma is a "blended" learning program comprising approximately 1,300 hours of online and in-class learning plus on-road clinical experiences. There are three modules (core skills, medical and trauma) which each have an online component prior to classroom education and this theoretical component is run concurrently while a student is practicing in the operation environment thus building the requisite base of experience to become a qualified Ambulance Officer.
It must be noted that while the format of the qualification has changed significantly in the move to predominantly online learning that the actual content of has not been reduced; if anything it has increased considering the National Certificate had twenty-eight credits at level 5 whereas the Diploma has one hundred and eleven. The number (and focus) of classroom days have been changed due to the majority of theoretical learning taking place online and classroom days heavily focussing on the psychomotor aspects of ambulance practice rather than teaching and assessing anatomy, physiology and pathology in great detail.
During (and after) the online and class phases of National Diploma the student must complete a Portfolio of Evidence for presentation at the End of Course Interview and Assessment. The Portfolio requires the student to demonstrate integrated clinical practice as well as self-reflection/professional development through skill logs, mentor reports and exemplars.
Degree.
A Bachelors Degree in Paramedicine (Level 7) is set to be required nationally for the intermediate life support level as of 2014. While it has essentially become the de-facto standard for entry to the profession St John still offer an internal ILS course for currently practicing paid staff who wish to move to the ILS level from either the old Paramedic level (intermediate aid) or the BLS level (Certificate or Diploma). The Degree was scheduled for introduction by the beginning of 2012 however it is understood that there have been delays in assembling a realistic framework to transition totally away from an in-service education model.
The degree is a comprehensive education program over three years consisting of 3,600 hours of learning which enables students to build a solid foundation of knowledge, skill, rationale and clinical judgement to the ILS level as a mixture of classroom, simulation suite and practical (on-road) experience catering for both school leavers who wish to pursue a Paramedic career (in the same way at other health professional degrees) and also for working Ambulance Officers who wish to upgrade their knowledge and obtain a tertiary qualification.
There were previously suggestions by St John that the organisation may follow Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Ambulance Service of New South Wales by offering employment at a defined exit point of the Degree allowing the student to essentially become a BLS Emergency Medical Technician full-time and complete the rest of the degree over a number of years and qualify as an ILS Paramedic. This pathway appears to no longer be being considered.
Postgraduate Certificate.
A Postgraduate Certificate (Level 8) is, as of 2013, the required qualification to reach ALS level (known as Intensive Care Paramedic) and is offered by AUT as the Postgraduate Certificate in Emergency Management or Whitireia as the Postgraduate Certificate in Specialty Care (Advanced Paramedic Practice).
The focus of this qualification is to build upon the Paramedics' knowledge and skillset to deliver advanced resuscitation interventions such as intubation, rapid sequence induction, chest decompression, thrombolysis and pacing as well as developing more advanced capability in clinical leadership and decision-making.
Clinical Practice.
The revised New Zealand Ambulance and Paramedical Service Standard (NZS8156:2008) defines three levels of practice and gives guidance as to their depth and breadth but it does not however define the specific interventions to be included in each (scope of practice). The specific scopes of practice are set every two years as part of the Clinical Practice Guidelines developed by the Clinical Working Group (part of Ambulance New Zealand) which consists of the Medical Directors, Medical Advisors and Paramedic representatives from both St John and Wellington Free Ambulance as well as the New Zealand Defence Force.
Although the standard is more-or-less correct there are aspects of practice which have evolved since it was written. ECG interpretation is a good example where in-depth 12 lead ECG interpretation is now taught at ILS level as part of the degree where at the time of writing the Standard (2008) this level of skill was generally reserved for ALS practitioners given the number of practicing graduates was smaller at that time.
Like other similar systems around the world such as South Africa, the UK and Australia, and in sharp polar contrast to the United States and (to a lesser degree) Canada, the system of practice is entirely based upon the professional discretion of the attending Ambulance Officers and there is no need for "online medical direction" to obtain approval for drugs or procedures. There is however a strong system of collegial support via the communications centre Clinical Desk (and on-call Medical Advisors) to assist with clinical decision-making when required, this however is not a system of seeking permission.
The below Delegated Scopes of Practice are as per the 2013-2015 Clinical Procedures and Guidelines
Emergency Medical Technician.
General pre-hospital emergency care to assess and manage both life-threatening and non-life-threatening situations using knowledge, skills and clinical judgement appropriate to generally non-invasive techniques and non-intravenous drug regimens.
Current scope of practice: Entonox, methoxyflurane, 12 lead ECG acquisition, nasopharyngeal airway, nebulised salbutamol, nebulised ipratropium, GTN spray, IM glucagon, laryngeal mask airway, ondansetron (oral), loratadine, PEEP valve, adrenaline (IM, IN and nebulised), prednisone, tramadol, urinary catheter troubleshooting
Paramedic.
Knowledge and skill to provide invasive care that significantly builds upon BLS capacity in terms of clinical judgement and capability including a wide range of pharmacology.
Current scope of practice: All of the above plus manual defibrillation, synchronised cardioversion, IV cannulation, IV fluid administration, IV glucose, morphine, fentanyl, naloxone, ondansetron, adrenaline (IV) for cardiac arrest, amiodarone (IV) for cardiac arrest, ceftriaxone, naloxone, midazolam (IM) for seizures, oxytocin, ceftriaxone, clopidogrel, lignocaine (SC) for ring blocks
Intensive Care Paramedic.
Provides advanced management where knowledge, rationale, judgement, skill and leadership are well developed and utilises the most comprehensive regime of pharmacology, airway support and ECG interpretation.
Current scope of practice: All of the above plus laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, capnography, 
cricothyrotomy, chest decompression, IO access, IO lignocaine, adrenaline, atropine, amiodarone, adenosine, calcium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, midazolam, ketamine, pacing, rocuronium, rapid sequence induction (select personnel only)
Additionally, there is a "First Responder" level used for non Ambulance work (such as Events and non emergency transfers (PTS)) as well as community first response in rural areas, as an initial starting point for those on the clinical education pathway (i.e. completing the Diploma or above) or where the standard education pathway has been found unsuitable for a volunteer. It must be noted that this level does not have an "authority to practice" and does not independently utilise the Clinical Practice Guidelines or many pieces of clinical equipment.
The Trustees of Ambulance New Zealand submitted an application to the Minister of Health in June 2011 that requested Paramedic and Intensive Care Paramedic be included as registered health professions and this is expected to be approved later in 2013. Registration would mean that a responsible authority (RA) under the Health Practitioners Competency Assurance Act would become responsible for governing Paramedic practice in New Zealand that practitioners would ultimately be responsible to this professional body which would be a significant change from the current "employer led" regulation.
Communications.
The EMS system in New Zealand is served by three dispatch centres, located in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. The dispatch centre in Christchurch provides coverage to the entire South Island, and is operated by St. John Ambulance. The dispatch centre in Auckland provides coverage for the north half of North Island, and is also operated by St. John Ambulance. The dispatch centre in Wellington provides coverage for the southern half of the North Island, is jointly operated by Wellington Free Ambulance and St John Ambulance but is staffed by Wellington Free Ambulance personnel. All three dispatch centres collaborate, and are capable of handling overflow of call volume for one another. The call centre technology is fully integrated and seamless, providing a single, 'virtual' national dispatch centre. To illustrate, if an emergency has occurred in Christchurch but those 1-1-1 lines are all busy, the call will be forwarded to the dispatch centres in either Auckland or Wellington. The call will be answered, information gathered, and placed into the computer network. It will then appear as a pending call on the desk of the appropriate dispatcher in Christchurch, all seamlessly.
The national emergency number for ambulances in New Zealand is 1-1-1.
The three dispatch centres also include significant advanced technologies, including AMPDS and Siren software for the triaging and assignment of calls. They also include a nationwide network of Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), showing the location and current status of every ambulance in the country. All dispatchers in New Zealand are certified Emergency Medical Dispatchers (EMDs), and meet the international standard for that qualification. Between them, the ambulance dispatch centres process approximately 300,000 calls per year originating with the 1-1-1 system. They also process an additional 800,000 calls per year from GPs, hospitals requesting transfers, medical alarm monitoring companies, and from paramedics themselves.
The telephone triage system used within the communication centres is the internationally regarded Advanced Priority Medical Dispatch System also known as ProQA whereby the caller is interrogated to determine the most appropriate problem detriment to guide the level of response in terms of speed and clinical capability.

Color Quality Scale

Color Quality Scale (CQS) is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce colors of illuminated objects. Developed by researchers at NIST, the measure is a possible answer to the criticism of the widely used color rendering index.
Pousset et al. developed a psychophysical experiment in order to evaluate light quality of LED light sources. It is based on colored samples used in the Color Quality Scale. Predictions of the CQS and results from visual measurements were compared.

Iʿtikāf

Iʿtikāf () is an Islamic practice consisting of a period of retreat in a mosque for a certain number of days in accordance with the believer's own wish. It is most common during the month of Ramadan, especially the last ten days.
Definition of I’tikaf.
The literal definition of the Arabic word I’tikaf is to stay in a particular place. However, in Islam it means to stay in a mosque for a particular time period — for the purpose of worshiping Allah (God) — while maintaining certain conditions.
In the last ten nights of Ramadan, performing I'tikaf becomes a means of ensuring that a person spends Laylat Al-Qadr in the act of worship
Conditions of I’tikaf.
There are a few conditions for the person who wishes to partake in the Divine blessing of I’tikaf:
1. Intelligence (Aql): Thus, the person must not be mentally unstable;
2. True Faith (Iman): Thus, although a Non-Muslim can perform the I’tikaf and it may be correct from the point of view of the outer actions, however to earn the Divine Reward, he or she must be a true believer;
3. Intention (Niyyat): I’tikaf must be performed for the purpose of seeking closeness to Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him) and not to show off or due to societal or family or peer pressure;
4. Place: One must stay inside the Masjid for the entire period for his I’tikaf to be correct except for very important or unavoidable reasons like going out to buy food for him or attending a funeral (the rules of this will be explained in more detail later…)
It is not a condition for the one who does I’tikaf to be fasting http://www.islamqa.com/en/12411
Duration of the I’tikaf.
The person performing I’tikaf must stay in this state for a minimum of three complete days from sunrise of the first day until the sunset of the third day (for example if he starts I’tikaf on Monday at Fajr time, he must complete it until Wednesday at Maghrib time). The first two days of I’tikaf are recommended and if a person wishes, he may leave after this period and end his I’tikaf, however if he completes two full days of I’tikaf in the Masjid (until the Maghrib of the second day), then it becomes obligatory upon him to continue his fast on the third day and to stay in the Masjid for the remaining period of his I’tikaf – meaning till the time of Maghrib of the third day.
Similarly, if a person goes into I’tikaf for 5 days, the 6th day becomes obligatory; and if he goes into I’tikaf for 8 days then the 9th day becomes obligatory and so on…
Thus, I’tikaf is for 3 full days and 2 nights which are in between these days and this period must be maintained. In this ruling, just as that of the daily Salat, the meaning of three complete days means three periods of Fajr to Maghrib.
Time of I’tikaf.
Anytime in which fasting is permissible is an opportune time for I’tikaf and the state of I’tikaf does not have a specific time related to it. Of course the “White Days” which are the 13th, 14th and 15th of the lunar month and the last ten days of the Month of Ramadhan are the best times for this spiritual exercise. Therefore, one can not make I’tikaf on the day of `Eid since it is forbidden to fast on that day and similarly, he can not start I’tikaf two days before `Eid.
It has been mentioned that the Prophet of Islam (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) used to perform I’tikaf in the Month of Ramadhan in the first 10 days (three days), the second 10 days (three days) and then in the last ten days (three days) as well.
Permission of the guardian.
As mentioned previously in passing, I’tikaf performed without the permission of his guardian or any person whose rights would be taken away if the person was to go in a state of I’tikaf is not correct. Thus, it is for this reason that the spouse must also take their partner's permission if their I’tikaf would infringe on marital rights with them. Similarly, if one’s parents are not happy or are concerned for their son or daughter and do not permit him to make I’tikaf, then the child is not permitted to go forth for this (recommended) act of worship.
The intention (Niyyah) for I’tikaf.
The intention for I’tikaf is of three main types. The most common form is the recommended I’tikaf, however it can also become obligatory (wajib) if a person makes an oath or promise to Allah ( for the fulfillment of something (and in that oath he had promised Allah (that he would perform I’tikaf if his prayer is fulfilled). The third intention which can be made for I’tikaf is that it is being done on behalf of someone else – similar to how people perform Hajj for their deceased relatives or make up missed prayers of parents who have died or others. Therefore, it is necessary for the correctness of I’tikaf to specify the intention and the type that one wants to perform.
Time and place of the intention of the I’tikaf and the place of I’tikaf.
The intention must be made from the beginning of the time of Fajr on the first day and it is not permissible to delay it until the end of the time of Fajr (just before sunrise), however if just before the rising of the sun of Fajr, one makes his intention, this will still be sufficient. At the time of making intention for I’tikaf, the person must be inside the Masjid in which he/she wishes to perform I’tikaf, however if at the beginning time of Fajr he leaves to redo his Wu¤h£ or for another important task, then he is still able to do his intention (upon returning).
The place of I’tikaf must be the Masjid and therefore, performing I’tikaf in any place other than a Masjid such as a room or hall used for salat a Musalla (specific building which is made only for Jam¡`at Salat and other places like this (which are not proper Masajid) is not correct.
The preferential order of where I’tikaf should be performed is: Masjidul Haram, Masjid an-Nabi (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family), Masjid Kufa and then the Masjid of Basrah – after these, then any other “Central” and “Congregational” Masjid is permissible to perform the I’tikaf in.
By stating this, it clearly means that in places like the traditional Hussainiyah or Imambargah and other places such as this, it is not correct to perform the I’tikaf – this act is limited to the four mentioned Masajid and then the Central Masjid of a city.
Based on this ruling, although the scholars permit I’tikaf in these other buildings (which are not proper Mas¡jid), however the specific rulings of I’tikaf would not hold in other such venues. If one was to perform I’tikaf in any place other than the “Central Masjid” then he would need to do so with the intention that this act would bring him closer to Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him) and that he is hoping for a reward in this act (of being done outside of a proper Masjid as per the Islamic legislations). Therefore, if there are three or four Masajid in one city, since they are not of the four Masajid in which I’tikaf can be performed in (with that special intention), the people may use all of them for the program of I’tikaf.
The meaning of the Central or Congregational Masjid is that which a majority of the people frequent (other than this Masjid would be those referred to with names such as the Masjid of the Bazar, the Masjid of a School, the Masjid inside a factory, etc.…) and it is not permissible to perform the I’tikaf in these places.
The courtyards and entrances of the Masjid are not considered as a part of the Masjid except in the case that they are recognized and known (by others) to be an actual part of the Masjid. If a person doubts if the place in which he is, is actually a Masjid or not, then according to the rules, he is not permitted to perform I’tikaf there until he ascertains and has certainty that the place where he is truly is a part of the Masjid.
Prohibited acts during I’tikaf.
The prohibited acts during the state of I’tikaf include:
1. Applying perfume and smelling perfume with the intention of deriving pleasure. This act makes I’tikaf null and void and is also a sin.
2. Discussions and arguments both in relation to the world and the faith. This means that a person argues with another to prove that he is better or smarter or that he knows more, etc.… However, if a person must argue or debate to uphold the truth and destroy falsehood, it is permissible - rather this is the best form of worship and servitude to Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him) during this noble state.
3. Buying and selling anything.
4. Deriving pleasure from the opposite sex in any way – holding hands, hugging, kissing, etc.… is completely forbidden in the state of I’tikaf.
If any of these things are performed, one’s I’tikaf becomes void and in certain cases a Kaffarah or penitence must be paid out (which will be discussed below).
Seeing as how the person in I’tikaf is also in a state of fasting, all of those things which make the fast void must not be performed which include: eating, drinking, sexual intercourse, masturbation (which is a sin at all times), ascribing lies to Allah (Glory and Greatness be to Him), the Noble Prophet (blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) or the A’immah (prayers be upon all of them), swallowing thick dust (and smoking as an extension), immersing one’s head in water (such as in a swimming pool), remaining in a state of ritual impurity until the time of Fajr, and forcing one's self to vomit. If any of these are done, then one must make up the fast in those ways mentioned in the books of Legal Rulings.
In addition, the rights of others who are in the Masjid must also be observed. The respect and honor of the Masjid must be observed and one should try to stay in a state of Wudhu the entire period.
Also, the cleanliness of the Masjid must also be maintained.
Those in this state should also try and keep away from talking about issues of the transient world (talking about anything other than Allah) are some of the things which have been mentioned in the books which highlight the spiritual traits of this state.
Leaving the Masjid for classes (school) or for study sessions with a study partner or for Tabl¢gh and propagation of the faith and other things such as this is not permissible as they do not fall into any of the three categories mentioned above (since when a person makes the intention to perform I’tikaf he has also taken into consideration that he will not be attending school and has made the necessary arrangements before hand. Similarly, the one engaged in I’tikaf knows from before hand that if his ‘field of work’ is Tabl¢gh, that he would be disconnecting himself from that ‘job’ for this period).
If a person performs his I’tikaf in a place in which another person was already in I’tikaf (but had left for a brief moment) however he has left his prayer mat or other signs that he was coming back to that spot, then the second person must leave that area, otherwise he would be considered as a usurper of that piece of land where he is performing his I’tikaf. His I’tikaf would be correct if he continues to stay there however he would have committed a sin.
If a person in I’tikaf has a wet dream and needs to perform a Ghusl, however it is not possible to do this in the Masjid (or its compound), it is obviously obligatory upon him to leave the Masjid and his I’tikaf will be considered null and void. The same rule applies to sisters who are not able to stay inside the Masjid due to their monthly cycle since they are not permitted to stay inside a Masjid, they too must immediately leave the Masjid and for them too, their I’tikaf is null and void.
According to obligatory precaution, if a person leaves the Masjid for a necessity, he must choose the shortest and closest route to leave and return by and it is obligatory that he does not keep himself out of the Masjid for more than the needed time period. It is also obligatory that he does not sit underneath an area which shades him. Rather, according to precaution, it is not permitted for him to sit outside of the Masjid except for cases of necessity.
If the person performing I’tikaf leaves the Masjid in order to complete a necessity upon him, and the time period which he leaves the Masjid for is a very long one such as that people would doubt or not consider him being in a state of I’tikaf, then his I’tikaf would be null and void.
Penitence for breaking the rules of the I’tikaf.
In some instances, if a person does one of the things which breaks his state of I’tikaf, he must offer a penitence. Some examples of this are mentioned as follows:

Kwyet Kinks

Kwyet Kinks is the third EP by The Kinks, released in September 1965. Unlike most of their other EPs, it contained all exclusive tracks and all were original compositions.
The EP represented a significant departure as hinted at by the play on words title as all four tracks are 'quieter' than the typical early Kinks rock sound, particularly lead track "Wait Till The Summer Comes Along", sung by Dave Davies with prominent acoustic guitar and a clear country or folk influence. The most well known track is "A Well Respected Man" which was the first real example of the social commentary and a songwriting style which would come to be associated with Ray Davies and The Kinks.
"A Well Respected Man" was released as a single in the US in October 1965 (b/w "Such A Shame") where it reached no. 13. Following the success of the similar "Dedicated Follower of Fashion" it was also released as a single in mainland Europe in 1966.
In the US, the tracks were included on the "Kinkdom" album (released November 1965). All four tracks were not available on another official Pye release in the UK, however three of the tracks (excluding "Such a Shame") were included on the budget Marble Arch compilation LP "Well Respected Kinks" in 1966 and "Such a Shame" appeared on that LP's follow up "Sunny Afternoon" in 1967. The EP was made available on CD in 1998 as part of the EP Collection boxed set. The tracks are currently available as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of "Kinda Kinks".

Mr. Chedworth Steps Out

Mr. Chedworth Steps Out is a 1939 Australian film directed by Ken G. Hall starring Cecil Kellaway.
Synopsis.
A mild-mannered clerk, George Chedworth, is married to the snobbish, nagging Julie, and has four children: gambling addict Arthur, beautiful Gwen, teenage singer Susie and young Fred. Chedworth lends money to Arthur to cover his gambling debts to a bookmaker, and is persuaded by the bookmaker on a long-shot wager. Chedworth is then fired from his job after 24 years of service. He is given a compensatory employment as a night watchman, and stumbles upon some money hidden by gangsters and an old printing press.
Chedworth uses the money to improve his situation. He wins a fortune from an accidental racing bet and from some apparently worthless gold mining shares sold to him by some crooks, including Arthur's boss Leon Fencott. Chedworth moves into a large house, unaware the money he discovered was counterfeit. Fencott is the head of the forgers.
When Arthur tries to pass off one of his forged bank notes to Fencott, the gangsters come after the money and kidnap Chedworth. They are arrested by Brian Carford, a federal agent who has been romancing Gwen and watching Chedworth to see if he is a forger. Chedworth gets to keep his legitimate fortune and Susie wins a singing competition.
Production.
The script was based on a 1936 English novel, "Mr Chedworth Hits Out" by F Morton Howard. It was to be the first of a £200,000 five-film program by Cinesound, the others being "Gone to the Dogs", "Robbery Under Arms", "The Further Adventures of Dad and Dave" (which became "Dad Rudd, M.P."), and "The Haunted House". "Robbery Under Arms" and "The Haunted House" were never made.
The film was specifically designed as a vehicle for Cecil Kellaway. He had been working in Hollywood following the success of "It Isn't Done" (1937) but agreed to come back to Australia especially to make the film at the request of Ken G. Hall. "He was getting much more money than we had offered him but he felt that he owed us something," said Hall. 
Kellaway later said he was also attracted to the lead role:
It is the part of a human being, not a screen stereotype, for 'Mr. Chedworth' is fighting a battle of circumstances. A lonely, down-trodden little man, he is fighting to uphold his inner better self. It will carry a message to every home, because it depicts the strange fact that it is in our homes we find our harshest critics. There is drama and comedy delightfully combined, when George Chedworth, reclaiming himself as a man, becomes at last the head of his house, and . . . 'steps out!"
There is a line in the film where Cecil Kellaway scolds his son (Peter Finch) for betting on horses. During filming this caused the crew to burst out laughing because Kellaway was known as a keen gambler. "He had his mind on the racetrack all the time," said Hall. "As soon as I'd say 'Cut!' he'd be off like a rabbit up a bank and out the back to the radio to hear what had won the last. He was a mad punter."
Support Roles.
The part of Cecil Kellaway's youngest daughter was played by Jean Hatton, a young singer who was brought to the attention of Ken G. Hall after she won a Deanna Durbin talent quest. She was signed by Cinesound Productions to a long-term contract, later appearing in "Come Up Smiling". Her part in the film was written especially for her. She sings two songs during the film's climax, "If It Rains, Who Cares" and "Lo, Hear the Gentle Lark", which was staged in a massive 40 foot set build for the film replicating a radio station.
Joan Deering, who plays the ingenue, had never acted on screen before but had a strong theatrical background, having toured with revue companies in England and South Africa. She was English and moved to Australia in 1935 after touring with Frank Neil's pantomime company. Ken G. Hall had met her socially and suggested she screen test. Peter Finch was cast after the impression he made in "Dad and Dave Come to Town" (1938).
Shooting.
Kellaway arrived back in Australia in early October 1938 and shooting took place through that month to November. Most of the film was shot in Cinesound's studios at Bondi with some location work at Lapstone Hill. A farewell ball to celebrate the end of shooting was held in December.
Costumes were designed by Thelma Afford, wife of top Australian writer Max Afford.
Release.
The film was not one of Cinesound's biggest successes but reportedly made "a comfortable profit". Reviews were positive.
The US rights were purchased by Casino Films in New York who at one stage announced they were considering possibly filming a remake. However this never happened.
