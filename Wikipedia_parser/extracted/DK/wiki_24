Neshaminy School District

Neshaminy School District is a large suburban public school district located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Neshaminy School District serves the municipalities of Middletown Township, Langhorne, Langhorne Manor, Penndel, Hulmeville, and Lower Southampton Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Students from the Middletown divisions of Levittown also attend these schools. Neshaminy School District encompasses approximately . According to 2000 federal census data, it serves a resident population of 69,638. Per Neshaminy School District officials, in school year 2007-08, the Neshaminy School District provided basic educational services to 8,963 pupils through the employment of 723 teachers, 521 full-time and part-time support personnel, and 52 administrators. In 2010, enrollment in the district's schools had declined to 8,712 pupils. According to Pennsylvania Department of Education, the enrollment is projected to decline by several hundred children to 8,394 pupils by 2019.
More than 1000 students, who live in the district, attend private elementary schools, not including day care centers, and about 1500 students attend private high schools in various other areas. These students are bused by the Neshaminy School District. 
The Neshaminy School District serves a large and diverse student population. Students comprise many different racial, ethnic, and economic backgrounds. The municipalities that are served range from having lower-middle-class families to highly affluent families. The school district is also a Blue-Ribbon awarding school district, with Maple Point Middle School having received the award, as well as Neshaminy High School.
In June 2006, the Neshaminy School District began a massive $82 million renovation of Neshaminy High School, which was originally constructed as a combination high school and junior high school in the 1950s. Most of the original structure had been demolished and was completely rebuilt. All that remained were two gymnasiums and the circular library, however all three received extensive renovations. The construction was mostly complete for the 2009-2010 school year, with a few remaining projects to be complete. [http://www.markshubin.com/MarkShubin/images/pageImage-rendering.jpg]
Neshaminy School District like many school districts across the country has been experiencing the troubles of decreasing enrollment, even though the surrounding areas continue to grow. Most of Neshaminy facilities were constructed during the 1950s and 1960s after the construction of Levittown and its ensuing development. Families then usually had five or more children, compared to the two child average now. The school district has thus been combining schools, and shutting others down. The first significant example was the merger of Neshaminy Middle with Maple Point Middle. Maple Point was the larger and more efficient facility than Neshaminy. Maple Point was constructed in the late 1970s and has been routinely maintained. It contains air-conditioning, a very modern look, a larger structure, and large expanses of land, and thus was chosen as the school to keep. Neshaminy Middle School which was constructed in the 1960s and in dire need of renovations was shut down, with the land possibly being sold to the ever-growing needs of St. Mary's hospital across the street. The only asset to Neshaminy was its swimming pool, which Maple Point lacks. Now only two other schools in the district have a pool, and those are Carl Sandburg Middle, which serves the Levittown sections, and Poquessing Middle School. The same process is projected for the elementary schools.

The editor describes the ranking as: "a ranking answers the question - which school districts do better than expectations based upon economics? This rank takes the Honor Roll rank and adds the percentage of students in the district eligible for free and reduced-price lunch into the formula. A district finishing high on this rank is smashing expectations, and any district above the median point is exceeding expectations."
In 2009, the academic achievement, of the students in the Neshaminy School District, was in the 74th percentile among all 500 Pennsylvania school districts Scale (0-99; 100 is state best)

Neshaminy School Paper Controversy.
On October 23, 2013, the editors of the Neshaminy High School student newspaper, the Playwickian, published an editorial announcing that the paper would no longer use the name of all the school’s teams, the Redskins, in the newspaper. The decision to abandon the use of the name in the paper was not unanimous and an editorial representing the view that the use of the name should continue was published at the same time.
On October 28, Principal McGee sent an email to the paper’s advisor, Tara Huber, claiming that the editors of the paper lacked the prerogative to enforce the measure without the permission of the school’s administrators and the school district. a position backed by Robert Hankes, then the president of the Pennsylvania School Press Association. At that time, Playwickian editor-in-chief, Gillian McGoldrick, said she expected the matter to be settled after a meeting on November 19.
As the November 19th date approached, more and more news outlets picked up and reported on the story.,
In the face of continued resistance on the part of the school administration, the editors secured legal representation and said they would enforce their ban, taking the matter to the courts if need be. Meanwhile, the local paper, the Bucks County Courier Times, adopted the policy proposed by the Playwickian editors and urged the school administration to accede to the school paper’s position. The school principal, McGee, expressed no concern about settling the matter in court.
Through April and into May 2014, the editors continued to enforce the policy, avoiding the use of the word, Redskins, while the local school board worked to develop a new policy concerning student publications. Early response to the proposal was not positive, with the students’ legal representative, Gayle Sproul calling it “overreaching,” and saying that it was in violation of both Pennsylvania state law as well as federal law. Others who weighed in against the proposed policy included those affiliated with the Center for Scholastic Journalism at Kent State University, the Columbia Scholastic Press Advisers Association, the Journalism Education Association, the National Scholastic Press Association and the Quill and School International Honor Society.
As the matter continued, the school paper’s advisor for 14 years, Tara Huber, was honored with the award for Journalism Teacher Of The Year by the Pennsylvania School Press Association., (subscription required)
One day after news of Huber’s award was published, the school administrators confiscated about half of the last issue of the year, an action considered ill-advised by the students’ attorney, Gayle Sproul,

In December 2009, the district administration reported that 1,708 pupils or 19% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.
In order to comply with state and federal laws, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Coordinator of Special Education.
In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding.
Neshaminy School District received a $5,975,986 supplement for special education services in 2010.
For the 2011-12 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.
Gifted education.
The District Administration reported that 519 or 5.62% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.

In addition to salary the teachers receive taxpayer funded health insurance, vision insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, paid personal days, 10 paid sick days which accumulate, paid leave for death in the family and many other benefits. Retiring teachers receive a bonus. According to Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Public School Employees’ Retirement System Board of Trustees, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary. In 2011, the average teacher salary in NSD was $77,320.79 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $25,595.03 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $102,915.00. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers’ total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security.
In June 2012, the Neshaminy Teachers' Union announced the intent to strike for the second time in 2012. State law permits them to strike for 10 days. In January 2012, the teachers walked out for 8 days. By state law, the 180-day school year must be completed by June 30 without weekend classes. A state mandated (due to strike) nonbinding arbitration report issued in May 2012 was rejected by the school board, but approved by the union. The cost of the proposal was over $20 million and included continued retirement bonuses. The teachers have been working without a contract since July 2008. In May, the school board served notice on the teachers' union that there would be 15 teacher layoffs for the 2012-13 school year.

School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.
In December 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit on the district. Several findings were reported to the school board and administration.
The district is funded by a combination of: a local tax on income, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government.

The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell’s policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others.
In the 2009-2010 budget year, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 2% increase in Basic Education Funding for a total of $12,432,036.

The amount of increase each school district receives is determined by the Governor and the Secretary of Education through the allocation set in the state budget proposal made in February each year. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and the Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal. In 2008, the district reported that 1,174 pupils received a free or reduced-price lunch due to their family meeting the federal poverty level.
Accountability Block Grant.

Federal stimulus grant.
The Neshaminy School District received over $2,394,000 in ARRA - Federal stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009-10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software.
Race to the Top grant.
Neshaminy School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district up to million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. Several Mercer County school districts applied for funding. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.
Common Cents state initiative.
The Neshaminy School District School Board chose to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. The report found multiple opportunities for savings.
Current Teacher Contract Negotiations.
Starting in 2008, the Neshaminy teachers (as well as any other "certified staff"), as represented by the Neshaminy Federation of Teachers (NFT), had begun negotiating with the Neshaminy School Board for a new contract. In 2011, the school board and teachers union are engaged in the 4th year of a contract negotiation. The Pennsylvania House of Representatives Education Committee conducted a hearing at the Neshaminy High School to discuss the impasses in the district's contract negotiations and issues surrounding teacher union strikes. Under the current contract, the teachers have the earnings level in the top 5% of all individual American wage earners, pay nothing for their health care, have equal say in the curriculum, and can retire after 10 years, which includes free health care and a retirement bonus. After the teacher strike in January 2012 (lasting from 1/9/2012 to 1/19/2012, a total of 8 days of the 10 day limit), as stated by Act 88, the NFT and NSB must commit to non-binding arbitration. The arbitrator proposed a new contract on May 3, 2012, which the NSB did not accept. The report requested "he report suggested teachers get between 0-2.25 percent salary increases, pay between 10-12 percent towards health care, and get 50 percent of back pay." The school board claims that the district cannot afford that offer, and proposed the closing of The Learning Center in order to stay fiscally sound.
Real estate taxes.
In 2011, the Neshaminy School Board set the property taxes rate at 152.0000 mills for the 2011-12 school year. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.
Act 1 Adjusted index.
The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise taxes above that index, unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. With the 2011 state education budget, the General Assembly voted to end most of the Act 1 exceptions leaving only special education costs and pension costs. The cost of construction projects will go to the voters for approval via ballot referendum.
The School District Adjusted Index for the Neshaminy School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.
For the 2011-12 school year, the Neshaminy School Board applied for several exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index including: Maintenance of Local Tax Revenue, Health Care-Related Benefits costs, and future teacher pension obligations. Each year the Neshaminy School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is publisher each year by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district’s index. Of the districts who sought exceptions 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction.
Neshaminy School Board also applied for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2010-11. Specifically they sought pension costs and maintenance of local revenue exceptions. In 2009, the board applied for two exceptions: special education costs and maintenance of selected revenue sources. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.
Property tax relief.
In 2011, property tax relief for 17,209 approved residents of Neshaminy School District was set at $209. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption.
Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.
Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).

UCLA Bruins football

The UCLA Bruins football program represents the University of California, Los Angeles in college football as members of the Pacific-12 Conference at the NCAA Division I FBS level. The Bruins have enjoyed several periods of success in their history, having been ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll at least once in every decade since the poll began in the 1930s. Their first major period of success came in the 1950s, under head coach Henry Russell Sanders. Sanders led the Bruins to the Coaches' Poll national championship in 1954, three conference championships, and an overall record of 66–19–1 in nine years. In the 1980s and 1990s, during the tenure of Terry Donahue, the Bruins compiled a 151–74–8 record, including 13 bowl games and an NCAA record eight straight bowl wins. The program has produced 28 first round picks in the NFL Draft, 30 consensus All-Americans, and multiple major award winners, including Heisman winner Gary Beban. The UCLA Bruins' main rivals are the USC Trojans. Jim L. Mora is currently the team's head coach.
The Bruins were the Pacific-12 Conference South Division Champions for two years in a row and played in both the 2011 and 2012 Pacific-12 Football Championship Games.
History.
Early History (1919-1924).
The first football team fielded by UCLA took the field in 1919. The team was coached by Fred Cozens. That UCLA football team compiled a 2–6 record. UCLA did not participate in an athletic conference until 1920, so the 1919 football team played a schedule full of local high schools and other assorted teams. Cozens was UCLA's athletics director from 1919-1942.
Harry Trotter took over the young UCLA football program after Cozens stepped down after guiding the Bruins in their first season. UCLA began to play in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (SCIAC) in 1920, and competed against Occidental College, California Institute of Technology, University of Redlands, Whittier College, and Pomona College. Coach Trotter's two wins were against Redlands and San Diego State, which did not join the SCIAC until 1926. Trotter left UCLA with a 2–13–1 record in three seasons (1920-1922).
James J. Cline took over the Bruins football program as its third head coach in 1923. Coach Cline's two wins were against Loyola Marymount University and San Diego State. Cline was replaced after two seasons and a 2–10–3 record.
William Spaulding era (1925-1938).
William H. Spaulding came to UCLA from Minnesota in 1925. As the Bruins head coach, his overall record in fourteen seasons was 72–51–8. During his tenure in Los Angeles, Spaulding led the Bruins to their first bowl appearance and victory, the 1938 Poi Bowl. Also during Spaulding's tenure, the Bruins left the SCIAC and joined the Pacific Coast Conference beginning in 1928.
Spaulding's 72 wins rank him among the best in head coaching victories in Bruin football history. He retired after a successful fourteen-season tenure ended after the 1938 season.
Edwin Horrell era (1939-1944).
Edwin Horrell was promoted to head coach following Spaulding's retirement. His 1942 UCLA Bruins team lost to Georgia in the 1943 Rose Bowl. He was the first coach to lead a UCLA team to defeat the rival USC. It was the first football victory in the UCLA-USC rivalry. The most notable player who played for Horrell at UCLA was Jackie Robinson.
Horrell's 1939 team compiled a 6–0–4 and his 1941 team posted a 5–5–1 record. With the exception of the 1942 season, the combined record of the Bruins during Horrell's tenure outside the aforementioned seasoms was 6–22–1. These struggles led to Horrell's firing after six seasons at the helm of UCLA football.
Bert LaBrucherie era (1945-1948).
Coach Bert LaBrucherie was hired by his alma mater to replace Horrell. LaBrucherie's overall record at UCLA was 23–16. In his second year as head coach, the Bruins were Pacific Coast Conference champions, but lost to Illinois in the Rose Bowl. LaBrucherie's Bruins only posted one losing season during his four seasons, a 3–7 1948 season in what turned out to be his final season.
LaBrucherie accepted the position of head football coach at California Institute of Technology after the 1948 season, departing UCLA.
Henry Sanders era (1949-1957).
Henry Sanders came to UCLA from Vanderbilt. He was arguably the best coach in school history, with an overall record of 66–19–1 () at UCLA and earned the school its only national championship in football in 1954. As head coach of the Bruins, Sanders led them to three Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) titles, two Rose Bowls (1953 and 1955 seasons) and to a 6–3 record over arch-rival USC.
Sanders instituted the distinctive football uniforms worn by the Bruins when he replaced the navy blue jerseys with "powderkeg blue," added the shoulder stripe to give the impression of motion, and changed the number style from block to clarendon. Sanders said these changes were made to make it easier to see his Bruins on the grainy black and white game films of the time.
The 1954 Bruins compiled a 9–0 record and climbed to the top of the Coaches' Poll, sharing the national championship with Ohio State, winner of the AP Poll's title. Due to the PCC's early "no repeat" rule, the undefeated Bruins were unable to compete in the Rose Bowl that season despite being the PCC champion. Second-place USC, who the Bruins defeated 34-0, played in the 1955 Rose Bowl instead and lost to Big Ten Conference champion and eventual co-national champion Ohio State, 20-7.
Henry Sanders was also known for intensifying the Bruins' rivalry with USC. His teams were always given a speech before the game against their cross-town rivals that always ended with "Beat SC!" A famous quote was attributed to Sanders regarding the rivalry, "Beating 'SC is not a matter of life or death, it's more important than that."
Shortly before the 1958 season was set to begin, Coach Sanders suffered and died from a heart attack in a Los Angeles hotel. Assistant coach George W. Dickerson took over the Bruins on an interim basis before suffering a nervous breakdown. Then, a full-time head coach was hired. For his successes, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1996.
William Barnes era (1958-1964).
William Barnes was the head coach for the UCLA Bruins football team for seven seasons. He guided his teams to a 31–34–3 (.478) record. He did have two seven-win seasons in 1960 and 1961, leading the Bruins to the 1962 Rose Bowl. That year, the Bruins finished the season ranked #16 in the final AP poll.
Barnes resigned after the 1964 season after learning that athletics director J.D. Morgan was not going to renew his contract.
Tommy Prothro era (1965-1970).
On January 11, 1965, Tommy Prothro was hired away from Oregon State as head coach of the UCLA Bruins.
In the 1965 football season, the Bruins lost their season opening game 13-3 at Michigan State, who then rose to become the top-ranked team in the country. The unheralded Bruins would go on a seven-game undefeated streak, surprising the national powers likes of Syracuse and Penn State. Going into the 1965 UCLA-USC rivalry football game ranked #7, the conference championship and 1966 Rose Bowl were on the line. #6 USC, led by Heisman Trophy winner Mike Garrett led 16-6 until UCLA got a touchdown on a pass from Gary Beban to Dick Witcher with four minutes to play. After the two-point conversion made it 16–14, UCLA recovered an onside kick. Beban then hit Kurt Altenberg on a 50-yard bomb and UCLA won, 20-16. Integrated UCLA then faced all-white Tennessee in the newly built Liberty Bowl stadium in Memphis, Prothro's native city. On the last play of the game, Tennessee defensive back Bob Petrella intercepted a UCLA pass to save a Volunteer win by a score of 37-34. Tennessee's winning drive was aided by a controversial pass interference call, the clock had questionably stopped twice, and a dropped pass that appeared to be a lateral was recovered by UCLA but was later ruled an incomplete forward pass. After the game, Prothro stated, "For the first time in my life, I am ashamed to be a Southerner."
Heading into the final game of the 1966 season vs. USC, UCLA was 2–1 in conference games, 8–1 overall and ranked #5 in the country. The Bruins, featuring a "dream backfield" of All-Americans Gary Beban and Mel Farr, lost only one game, at rainy Washington, 16-3, where Huskies' head coach Jim Owens had devoted his entire season to beating Prothro. UCLA had beaten UW the season before, 28-24, with Prothro's trick play, the Z-streak in which a receiver trots towards the sideline like he's going out of the game and then runs a streak pattern unguarded by the inattentive defender. USC was 4–0 in conference and 7–1 overall, having lost to unranked Miami. The Bruins and Trojans played a different number of conference due to uneven scheduling caused by new AAWU members Oregon and Oregon State and schedules made years in advance. It was widely assumed that only losses would be considered and the winner of the 1966 UCLA-USC game would go to the 1967 Rose Bowl. UCLA star quarterback Gary Beban broke his ankle the week before in a win over Stanford, but backup Norman Dow, making his first and only start at quarterback, led UCLA to a 14-7 win. That left USC with a 4–1 conference record (7–2 overall) and #5 UCLA with a 3–1 conference record (9–1) overall. Due to their win over USC, it was widely assumed UCLA would get the Rose Bowl berth. However, a vote the next Monday among the AAWU conference athletic directors awarded USC the Rose Bowl berth. It was speculated that the directors believed Beban could not play for UCLA in the Rose Bowl due to the broken ankle, thereby giving the Big Ten Conference representative, Purdue, a better chance to win. As it turned out, Beban could have played. But a bigger reason was that this was to make up for 1964 when Oregon State was voted in ahead of USC. The coach of Oregon State in 1964 was Prothro. Another speculation was the vote was against UCLA out of pure jealousy by the rest of the conference, which voted 7–1 for the clearly inferior team. This vote deprived Prothro of being the first coach to earn three consecutive Rose Bowl berths and UCLA athletic director J.D. Morgan called it a "gross injustice" and the "a dark day in UCLA and AAWU Athletic history." Inflamed UCLA students who had gathered for the Rose Bowl celebration rally, took to the streets of Westwood in protest and actually blocked the 405 Freeway for a short time. Ironically, Morgan was the force behind establishing a tie-breaking method adopted by the conference one year later in which only loss column counted; the first tiebreaker was head-to-head results, followed by overall record. If there was still a tie, the Rose Bowl berth would go to the team that had not played in the Rose Bowl the longest. But it was too late for UCLA. In their final game, USC made the AAWU decision look bad by losing to Notre Dame, 51-0. They went on to lose the Rose Bowl as well to Purdue, 14-13, finishing the season at 7–4.
In 1967, Prothro helped a second quarterback capture the Heisman Trophy when Gary Beban was awarded the trophy after the regular season. He would bring his #1 ranked UCLA Bruin team to face #2 USC in one of the "Games of the Century". Despite playing with cracked ribs, Beban threw for 301 yards, but UCLA lost, 21-20, on a spectacular 64-yard run by O. J. Simpson in the 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game. Another big factor was UCLA's acclaimed sophomore kicker Zenon Andusyshyn missing a chip shot field goal, and having two field goals and an extra point attempt blocked.
In what was acknowledged to be a rebuilding year, the Bruins opened the 1968 season with a 63-7 defeat of Pittsburgh and a win over Washington State. The season ground to a halt at Syracuse and with the season-ending injury of quarterback Billy Bolden, and UCLA would win only one more game, over Stanford 20–17. The Bruins gave #1 USC and Heisman Trophy winner O. J. Simpson a scare in a 28–16 loss; UCLA trailed 21–16 late in the fourth quarter and had the ball inside USC's 10-yard line, but USC recovered a fumble and then used almost all of the remaining time in driving for their insurance touchdown.
1969 was the year Prothro had geared his recruiting efforts towards as he believed this was his best team and was capable of contending for the national championship. The Bruins, quarterbacked by a sensational Junior College transfer Dennis Dummit discovered by Prothro, were undefeated until they faced #10 Stanford in Palo Alto. Once again, Prothro was let down by now senior kicker Zenon Andrusyshyn as he missed a short field goal late in the game with the score tied 20–20. Suddenly, two long Jim Plunkett passes had Stanford in field goal range in the final seconds, but UCLA blocked Steve Horowitz's attempt to preserve the tie. One again, the UCLA-USC game would decide the Pac-8 title and the 1970 Rose Bowl berth. UCLA was ranked 6th with a 5–0–1 record in conference and 8–0–1 overall USC was #5 and was 6–0 in conference and 8–0–1 overall (tied Notre Dame in South Bend, 14-14); UCLA and USC were both unbeaten coming into their rivalry game for the first time since 1952. UCLA scored midway through the fourth quarter to take a 12-7 lead (knowing he need a win and not a tie to advance to the Rose Bowl, Prothro had the Bruins go for two after each touchdown and each attempt failed). USC then drove to the winning touchdown with 1:38 to play to win 14-12. The Trojans were aided by two controversial calls; the first was a dubious pass interference call on UCLA's Danny Graham on a 4th-and-10 incompletion. Secondly, on the winning touchdown pass reception, USC receiver Sam Dickerson appeared to be either out of bounds, out of the back of the end zone, or both. This loss supposedly was harder for Prothro to take than the 1967 loss and the freak officiating calls resembled the debacle at Tennessee in 1965.
In what turned out to be his final season at UCLA, Prothro's team suffered a rash of key injuries and finished 6–5, yet they were three close games from a 9–2 season and Rose Bowl berth. Before those injuries set in, UCLA took a 3–0 record into Austin to play defending national champ and top ranked Texas. Trailing 13-3 at the half, UCLA rallied and had a 17-13 lead in the final minute. But with 12 seconds left, Texas completed a long pass when their receiver caught the ball between two UCLA defenders, who then collided, allowing the receiver to score. UCLA also blew a 20-point fourth quarter lead against Oregon, when Ducks sophomore quarterback Dan Fouts rallied his team to three touchdowns and a 41–40 win. Finally, there came the showdown with Stanford; the game was expected to be a shootout between UCLA quarterback Dennis Dummit and Heisman winner Jim Plunkett. But the defenses ruled as UCLA took a 7-6 lead into the 4th quarter. Stanford took a 9-7 lead on a field goal, but UCLA was driving to a potential game winning field goal or touchdown themselves when they completed a pass inside the Stanford 10-yard-line, only to have the receiver get sandwiched by two defenders on the tackle and fumble. This game ultimately decided the Pac-8 championship and 1971 Rose Bowl representative. The season ended on a high note however, when UCLA beat rival USC, 45–20, in a game that was not that close. This would end up being Prothro's final game at UCLA. Prothro was frustrated by bizarre officiating at critical moments, numerous last minute narrow losses, and losing out of the Rose Bowl by the conference vote in 1966. Prothro also decried the Pac-8 rule that only allowed the conference champion to go to a bowl game; he witnessed many lower ranked inferior teams (often ones he defeated during the season) go to bowl games while his Bruins stayed home.
After George Allen was fired by the Los Angeles Rams, Prothro accepted that job, leaving the Bruins after six seasons and a 41–18–3 record. Prothro was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1991.
Pepper Rodgers era (1971-1973).
Pepper Rodgers came to UCLA from Kansas after the departure of Prothro. In Rodgers' three seasons at the helm of the Bruins, UCLA finished 2–7–1, 8–3 and 9–2. In 1972, the Bruins finished the season ranked #17 and #15 in the final Coaches' and AP polls, respectively. In 1973, the Bruins finished ranked #9 and #12 in the final Coaches' and AP polls, respectively.
Rodgers surprised UCLA fans, players and administration by deciding to accept the head football coach position at his alma mater, Georgia Tech after the 1973 season. He left the Bruins after compiling a 19–12–1 overall record.
Dick Vermeil era (1974-1975).
As head coach at UCLA, Dick Vermeil compiled a 15–5–3 record in two seasons (1974–75), including a 9–2–1 record in 1975 when he led the Bruins to their first conference championship in 10 years, and a win in the Rose Bowl over undefeated and number 1 ranked Ohio State. Vermeil won Pac-10 Coach of the Year honors in 1975.
Vermeil became to second out of three UCLA head coaches (and third in a row to leave UCLA for another job) to leave for the NFL when he accepted on offer to become head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. His final record as head coach of the Bruins is 15–5–3.
Terry Donahue era (1976-1995).
Terry Donahue was promoted from assistant coach to head coach of the Bruins football team following Vermeil's departure. Donahue has the most conference wins of any head coach in Pacific-10 Conference history (98) and also the most wins in UCLA football history (151). His teams compiled a record of 8–4–1 in bowl games and were the first to win a bowl game in seven consecutive seasons. Donahue's UCLA teams won or shared five Pacific-10 Conference championships and won three Rose Bowls (1983, 1984, and 1986). Donahue's record was 10–9–1 against USC in the UCLA–USC rivalry. His teams won four New Year's Day bowl games in a row from 1983 to 1986.
Donahue retired from coaching after twenty seasons was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2000. His final record is 151–74–8.
Bob Toledo era (1996-2002).
Bob Toledo was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach of the Bruins after Donahue's retirement. In 1996, his first season as head coach, the Bruins finished with a mediocre 5–6 record. The highlight of the season was a comeback win over USC.
The 1997 team finished as co-champions of the Pacific-10 Conference with Washington State. However with Washington State defeating the Bruins in the season opener, the Cougars earned the right to play in the Rose Bowl. The highlights of that season were a 66-3 win over the Texas and a victory at the Cotton Bowl Classic over Texas A&M, and a victory over USC.
The 1998 season started out as one of the best in the history of UCLA football. The team was high enough in the BCS standings to merit entry to the national championship game, and all UCLA needed to do was beat unranked University of Miami, who were major underdogs after a 66-13 loss to the week before. UCLA was also coming off of their eighth consecutive victory over USC and 20th straight win overall. However, Miami won 49-45, ending UCLA's chances of playing in the national championship game. They instead settled for a trip to the Rose Bowl as Pac-10 champions, but lost to Wisconsin. This is seen as the turning point for both UCLA and USC's football programs.
The 1999 season was a major disappointment, with the team finishing 4–7. This was the first year that USC had defeated them in the annual Battle for the Victory Bell since 1990. The year also had the dubious distinction of a 55–7 loss to Pac-10 foe Oregon State, the worst defeat of the Bruins in 69 years.
In 2000, the Bruins finished 6–6 with a loss in the Sun Bowl, again against Wisconsin.
The 2001 season started with promise as the Bruins got off to a fast start with a 6–0 record. However, four straight losses to Stanford, Washington State, Oregon, and USC, the Bruins faded out of postseason contention.
UCLA finished off 8–5 in Toledo's final season in 2002. The team finished 7–5 in the regular season, but Toledo was fired after a fourth straight loss to USC. The Bruins did reach the Las Vegas Bowl, but interim coach Ed Kezirian coached—and won—his only game in charge of the program.
Toledo finished with a record of 49–32, for a winning percentage of .605, including one winning streak of 20 consecutive victories, a school record. Toledo's greatest accomplishment with the team may have been in the 1997 season, where the team finished 10–2 with a victory over Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Toledo's Bruins were 3–4 against UCLA's cross-town archrival, the USC Trojans.
Karl Dorrell era (2003-2007).
Longtime college and NFL assistant Karl Dorrell was brought in to revive the glory of the UCLA football program, his alma mater, after Toledo was fired. Dorrell also was brought in to UCLA to clean up a program marred by off-the-field problems in the final years of Bob Toledo's tenure. He was the first African American head football coach in UCLA football history.
Dorrell's UCLA Bruins team recorded a mark of 6–7 in his first season as head coach in 2003, with an appearance in the Silicon Valley Bowl, and a loss to Fresno State. In 2004, his second season, the team finished with a record of 6–6 an appearance in the Las Vegas Bowl, with a loss to Wyoming.
In 2005, his third season as head football coach, Dorrell was able get his first win against a ranked opponent, No. 21 Oklahoma, featuring Adrian Peterson. On October 1, 2005, head coach Tyrone Willingham and his Washington Huskies came to the Rose Bowl for a Pacific-10 Conference game to play UCLA. This was the first time two black head coaches faced each other in a Pac-10 conference game. At the time, Sylvester Croom of Mississippi State was the only other black coach heading an NCAA Division I football program. Dorrell achieved his first win against a top-ten opponent with a 47-40 upset win over No. 10-ranked rival California. Three Bruin wins in the 2005 season set new school records for biggest comebacks earning the nickname "The Cardiac Kids." They came thanks largely to the heroics of quarterback Drew Olson and tailback Maurice Jones-Drew. In the regular season the Bruins came from down 21 points to win in overtime against both Washington State and Stanford. In the Stanford comeback, the Bruins scored 21 points in the final 7:04 of the fourth quarter. In the Sun Bowl, the Bruins set the record again by coming back from 22 points down. The Bruins were ranked No. 7 in the nation until a 52–14 blowout loss to a 3–8 Arizona team. The Bruins came into the UCLA-USC rivalry last regular season game ranked No. 11. They suffered a 66-19 defeat to the No. 1 2005 USC Trojans football team. This was the largest margin of defeat since the series began in 1929 with a 76-0 defeat. The Bruins finished third in the Pac-10 standings. On December 30, 2005 his Bruins defeated the Northwestern Wildcats in the Sun Bowl, 50-38, finishing the season with a 10–2 record. At the end of the 2005 season, Dorrell received pay bonuses for coaching successful seasons. He was named Pac-10 co-coach of the year along with USC head coach Pete Carroll.
In 2006, Dorrell's fourth season, the Bruins finished the season 7–6 (5–4 in conference) and finished fourth-place in the Pac-10. UCLA played its first game at the University of Notre Dame since the 1960s and was leading 17-13, but the Irish scored a touchdown in the final minute to win. The most notable victory of his coaching career at UCLA was a 13–9 defeat of No. 2-ranked and Bowl Championship Series title-game-bound USC on December 2, 2006. The win kept the Trojans out of the title game and broke a seven-game UCLA losing streak to the Trojans, thereby preserving the Bruins' eight-game win streak over USC from 1991 to 1998 as the longest run in the history of the rivalry. The victory also clinched a winning season for UCLA. The Bruins played in the Emerald Bowl in San Francisco against a Bobby Bowden-coached Florida State team on December 27, 2006 and lost, 44-27.
In Dorrell's fifth season at UCLA, with 20 returning starters and a team of his own recruits, hopes were high for the Bruins in 2007. After starting the season with a couple of wins over Stanford and BYU, and achieving a No. 11 AP Poll ranking, however, UCLA stumbled against an injured, winless, and unranked Utah team, 44-6. Four weeks later, Dorrell's Bruins fell again; this time 20–6 to an unranked, winless Notre Dame team. The Bruins did, however, post wins against seemingly more difficult PAC-10 opponents, including a No. 10 Cal team. However; the bad taste of losses to teams the Bruins were favored to beat (including an embarrassing 27-7 loss to Washington State) raised questions about Dorrell's play-calling and ability to motivate his players. After the Washington State loss, UCLA Athletic Director Dan Guerrero addressed UCLA's inconsistent football performances for the first time, stating "I will be very interested to see how we finish the season. And you can use that." Many took this as a hint that Dorrell's job might be in serious jeopardy. The Bruins would go on to lose to Arizona and Arizona State by a combined score of 58–47, but surprisingly shut out an Oregon Ducks team that a week earlier lost starting quarterback and Heisman Trophy Candidate Dennis Dixon to a knee injury. Heading into the final game of the regular season against crosstown-rival USC, the Bruins still had an outside chance at a Rose Bowl berth that might have saved Dorrell's job; with a victory over USC and some help from Arizona (with a win over ASU), the Bruins could have been the first-ever five-loss team to play in the Rose Bowl. It wasn't to be, however, and the Bruins finished the 2007 Regular season with a miserable offensive performance in a 24–7 loss to USC and a record of 6–6.
On December 3, 2007, Los Angeles papers and the Associated Press reported that Karl Dorrell was fired during a meeting with athletic director Dan Guerrero. Dorrell was offered the choice, but decided not to coach in the Las Vegas Bowl. Defensive coordinator DeWayne Walker served as interim coach for the game, where UCLA lost to BYU.
Rick Neuheisel era (2008-2011).
On December 29, 2007, Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Rick Neuheisel, formerly head coach at Colorado and Washington, was brought back to his alma mater and hired as UCLA's 15th head football coach after his former Bruins teammate Dorrell was fired. Neuheisel coined the phrase "Passion Bucket" during an interview on The Dan Patrick Show by saying, "When you’re at UCLA, you have to have your passion bucket full when you play the Trojans."
Neuheisel had his first win on September 1 as the Bruins' head coach as they defeated #18 Tennessee, 27-24. The win came in overtime as Tennessee's field goal try sailed wide left. However, the team's momentum came to a halt in successive weeks. A brutal 59–0 defeat on the road at the hands of #15 BYU was followed by a disappointing 31–10 loss at home to unranked Arizona in the Bruins' Pac-10 opener. The UCLA offense failed to score a touchdown in either contest. The team finished the season 4–8 overall and 3–6 in conference.
Despite this record, Neuheisel was still able secure the fifth-best recruiting class in the nation in 2009 as rated by Scout.com. The class was headlined by two former USC commits, Morrell Presley and Randall Carroll, offensive linemen Xavier Sua-Filo and Stan Hasiak, and running back Damien Thigpen. Nevertheless, the Bruins fell to 4–8 in 2010, losing six of their last seven games and failing to receive a bowl berth. Player injuries and other attrition depleted UCLA of its roster depth, while true freshmen were forced into action and seniors who were previously reserves became starters; a quarterback who had attempted only 17 passes in his career became the starter. At the end of the season Neuheisel fired two assistant coaches, including Chow, and said he would “be crushed ... if we’re not going to a bowl game a year from now.” 
The 2011 season brought about continued mediocre performance, although the team's record improved to 6–6 in regular season play. Despite the lackluster overall record, the Bruins won the first Pac-12 South Division title, as crosstown rival USC was ineligible due to NCAA sanctions. A 50-0 shutout loss to USC to end the regular season—UCLA's fifth consecutive loss to the Trojans—prompted speculation that Neuheisel would be fired.
Neuheisel was fired as head coach of UCLA on November 28, 2011. He was allowed to coach his final game at the December 2 Pac-12 Conference football Championship game, where the team lost 49-31 to the Oregon Ducks.
Jim Mora era (2012-present).
On December 10, 2011, UCLA athletics director Dan Guerrero announced the hiring of former Atlanta Falcons and Seattle Seahawks head coach Jim Mora as the Bruins 16th head football coach. Mora signed a five-year contract for $12 million, plus incentives.
The results of the new regime came early, as UCLA landed a consensus #12 ranked recruiting class in 2012 after having a class ranked in the high 40s at Rick Neuheisel's departure. In Mora's first season, the Bruins finished 9–5 capped with a loss in the 2012 Holiday Bowl.
In Mora's second season, the Bruins improved to 10–3, capping the season with a victory in the 2013 Sun Bowl. Behind the leadership of quarterback Brett Hundley, the Bruins came within one game of reaching the Pac-12 championship game and beat crosstown rivals USC for the second straight year. After the season, Mora and UCLA agreed to terms on a contract extension and raise.
Rivalries.
USC.
UCLA's rivalry with USC is unusual in that they are one of a few pairs of Division I FBS programs that share a major city. Both are within the L.A. city limits, approximately apart. Until 1982, the two schools also shared the same stadium: The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
The crosstown rivals play each year for city bragging rights and the Victory Bell; and often for the right to go to the Rose Bowl. The USC rivalry tends to draw the focus of student supporters since many USC students have friends or family members attending "that other school" (of course, many USC students refer to their UCLA friends in the same manner) and many Southern California families are evenly divided between Trojan Cardinal and Bruin Blue. USC leads the all time series 44–30–7 ties (2 Southern Cal victories vacated by the NCAA).
California.
The Bruins also enjoy an annual rivalry with another in-state conference foe, the California Golden Bears. The rivals have faced each other 84 times, every year starting in 1933. UCLA leads the all-time series against Cal, 51-32-1.
Facilities.
Rose Bowl.
The Rose Bowl is a National Historic Landmark located in Pasadena, California with an official capacity of 92,542. It has been the home football field for the UCLA Bruins since the 1982 season. The Bruins had played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after joining the Pacific Coast Conference in 1928. The Coliseum is also the home of the rival USC Trojans. As the Coliseum is located across the street from the USC campus, Bruin officials long sought to move out from under the Trojans' shadow. An on-campus facility was discussed, but UCLA's location is not conducive to adequate traffic flow, and the campus lacks room for sufficient parking. There was an attempt to build a 44,000 seat stadium on campus, at the site where Drake Stadium eventually was built. However, the proposal was blocked by influential area residents, as well as other politicians. In addition, the Coliseum already was constructed by and is a facility of the State of California. When the Oakland Raiders became the Los Angeles Raiders, in 1982, and after arduous negotiations with the city of Pasadena, UCLA decided to move out of the Coliseum, relocating its home games to the Rose Bowl Stadium. UCLA has participated in five Rose Bowl games since moving to the stadium, including the 1983 Rose Bowl at the end of the Bruins' first season there. From 1919 to 1927, the Bruins (then known as the Cubs) used Moore Field at the Vermont Ave. campus of the "Southern Branch of the University of California."
Acosta Athletic Complex.
Training room, weight room, football facilities, and locker rooms are all located in the Acosta Athletic Complex, just west of Pauley Pavilion.
Spaulding Field.
The on campus practice facility for the football team is Spaulding Field, which has two football fields, one grass and one artificial turf, or synthetic turf. Because of space constraints, the Bruins don't have a complete 100 yard field for practice.
Uniforms.
The UCLA athletic colors are "True Blue" and gold. The "True Blue" is a slightly darker shade than the previous powder blue worn by teams.
In the early days of the school, UCLA had the same colors as the California Golden Bears: Yale Blue and California Gold. Blue symbolized the ocean, while gold represented the state of California, known as the "Golden State".
When football coach Red Sanders came to UCLA for the 1949 season he redesigned the football uniforms. The Yale Blue was changed to a lighter shade of blue. Sanders figured that the baby blue would look better on the field and in film. He would dub the baby blue uniform "Powderkeg blue", powder blue with an explosive kick. For the 1954 season, Sanders added the now familiar loop on the shoulders, the UCLA Stripe, to give an impression of motion. The away uniforms became white, with a navy blue and gold shoulder stripe and gold pants. The helmets became gold.
At times, beginning with the 1954 football season, the font for the numbers on the uniforms has been Clarendon typeface. Otherwise it has been block numerals. In the 1980s the uniform pants became yellow to look better in color publications, the jerseys a lighter blue, and the UCLA script was added to the helmets. In the 1990s, the uniform pants became gold again.
In 2003, the True Blue colors were adopted. The away uniforms got true blue shoulder stripes and numbers in 2006, but were replaced by navy blue again in 2010.
In 2009, the Bruins wore a 1967 throwback uniform against Washington and USC, though against USC the team's normal helmet was worn.

Jung Do Kwan

Jung Do Kwan was founded in 1956 by Young Woo Lee, and was the last of the original nine Kwans that formed the Kukkiwon. This is detailed in "A Modern History of Taekwondo" by Kyong Myong Lee and Kang Won Sik (1999).
An original student of the Chung Do Kwan, Young Woo Lee was advised by the current Chung Do Kwan president to choose a similar name to Chung Do Kwan, so he chose Jung Do Kwan. 
Young Woo Lee died in August 2006 in Seoul, Korea. Until his death, he remained active in the World Taekwondo Federation, and served on the Dan/Poom black Belt promotion committee of the Kukkiwon. 
Taekwondo Jung Do Kwan still exists today, but only as a fraternal social friendship club. The official training curriculum endorsed by Taekwondo Jung Do Kwan is the Kukkiwon curriculum. The new President of the Jung Do Kwan will be announced soon.
Meaning.
The word "jung" can be translated as "righteous" while "do" means way. So Jung Do Kwan can be translated as school of the righteous way.

Elizabeth Foreman Lewis

Elizabeth Foreman Lewis (May 24, 1892 – August 7, 1958), was an American children's book author.
Life.
She was born Elizabeth Foreman in Baltimore, Maryland and studied art at the Maryland Institute of Fine Arts from 1909–1910. Of that time, she has said, My sister and I grew up in a world of books, country life, horses, dogs, and a variety of other pets, a background threaded by colorful strands of wit, hearty laughter, singing, hospitality, and naturally in Maryland, good food. Our chief instruction, beside that of school and church, came from the proverbs in the home. Sometimes I think these brief, pungent expressions of man's age-old wisdom have had more influence than anything else in shaping my life. When editors and secretaries weary of my endless re-writing, they do not guess that I am still at the mercy of ten words which accompanied every girlhood task: 'If worth doing at all, it is worth doing well!'
She attended a secretarial school in Baltimore from 1916–1917, preparatory to travel to China for the Methodist Women's Board. Later in 1917 she received religious instruction at the Bible Seminary in New York.
She then became a Methodist missionary and teacher in China, initially as the associate mission treasurer for the Women's Foreign Missionary Society in Shanghai (1917–1918). During the next two years, she was a teacher in the schools of Nanjing, and a district supervisor of schools in Chongqing. In Nanjing, she taught at two schools – a girls boarding school and a boys academy. She met her husband, John Abraham Lewis, who was also a Methodist Missionary in the Upper Yangtze for many years. They got married in 1921. They had one son, John Fulton Lewis, who grew up to become a newspaper editor and author.
After several years, due to illness, she had to leave China. Once back in America, she used her Chinese experiences as inspiration for novels and short stories. Her first book, "Young Fu of the Upper Yangtze", based on her time as a director of schools in Chungking (Chongqing), won the 1933 Newbery Award and the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1960. 
She died in Baltimore, Maryland.

Attachment therapy

Attachment therapy is a controversial category of alternative child mental health interventions intended to treat attachment disorders. The term generally includes accompanying parenting techniques. Other names or particular techniques include "the Evergreen model", "holding time", "rage-reduction", "compression therapy", "rebirthing", "corrective attachment therapy" and Coercive Restraint Therapy. It is found primarily but not exclusively in the United States and much of it is centered in about a dozen clinics in Evergreen, Colorado, where Foster Cline, one of the founders, established his clinic in the 1970s. This article describes this particular set of interventions although in clinical literature the term "attachment therapy" is sometimes used loosely to mean any intervention based, or claiming to be based, on attachment theory, particularly outside the USA. Attachment therapy as described in this article should not be confused with other schools of therapy which are more empirically based and which aim to address problems stemming from disrupted attachment to caregivers.
Attachment therapy is a treatment used primarily with fostered or adopted children who have behavioral difficulties, sometimes severe, but including disobedience and perceived lack of gratitude or affection for their caregivers. The children's problems are ascribed to an inability to attach to their new parents, because of suppressed rage due to past maltreatment and abandonment. The common form of attachment therapy is "holding" therapy, in which a child is firmly held (or lain upon) by therapists or parents. Through this process of restraint and confrontation, therapists seek to produce in the child a range of responses such as rage and despair with the goal of achieving catharsis. In theory, when the child's resistance is overcome and the rage is released, the child is reduced to an infantile state in which he or she can be "re-parented" by methods such as cradling, rocking, bottle feeding and enforced eye contact. The aim is to promote attachment with the new caregivers. Control over the children is usually considered essential and the therapy is often accompanied by parenting techniques which emphasize obedience. These accompanying parenting techniques are based on the belief that a properly attached child should comply with parental demands "fast, snappy and right the first time" and should be "fun to be around". These techniques have been implicated in several child deaths and other harmful effects.
This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It is primarily based on Robert Zaslow's rage-reduction therapy from the 1960s and '70s and on psychoanalytic theories about suppressed rage, catharsis, regression, breaking down of resistance and defence mechanisms. Zaslow, Tinbergen, Martha Welch and other early proponents used it as a treatment for autism, based on the now discredited belief that autism was the result of failures in the attachment relationship with the mother.
It has been described as a potentially abusive and pseudoscientific intervention that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children, including at least six documented child fatalities. Since the 1990s there have been a number of prosecutions for deaths or serious maltreatment of children at the hands of "attachment therapists" or parents following their instructions. Two of the most well-known cases are those of Candace Newmaker in 2000 and the Gravelles in 2003. Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by the publication of a Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy. In April 2007, ATTACh, an organization originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting, promoting instead newer techniques of attunement, sensitivity and regulation. Some leading attachement therapists have also specifically moved away from coercive practices.
This form of treatment differs significantly from evidence-based attachment-based therapies, talking psychotherapies such as attachment-based psychotherapy and relational psychoanalysis or the form of attachment parenting advocated by the pediatrician William Sears. Further, the form of rebirthing sometimes used within attachment therapy differs from Rebirthing-Breathwork.
Treatment characteristics.
The controversy, as outlined in the 2006 American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) Task Force Report, has broadly centered around "holding therapy" and coercive, restraining, or aversive procedures. These include deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, punishments related to food and water intake, enforced eye contact, requiring children to submit totally to adult control over all their needs, barring normal social relationships outside the primary caretaker, encouraging children to regress to infant status, reparenting, attachment parenting, or techniques designed to provoke cathartic emotional discharge. Variants of these treatments have carried various labels that change frequently. They may be known as "rebirthing therapy", "compression therapy", "corrective attachment therapy", "the Evergreen model", "holding time", "rage-reduction therapy" or "prolonged parent-child embrace therapy". Some authors critical of this therapeutic approach have used the term Coercive Restraint Therapy. It is this form of treatment for attachment difficulties or disorders which is popularly known as "attachment therapy". Advocates for Children in Therapy, a group that campaigns against attachment therapy, give a list of therapies they state are attachment therapy by another name. They also provide a list of additional therapies used by attachment therapists which they consider to be unvalidated.
Matthew Speltz of the University of Washington School of Medicine describes a typical treatment taken from The Center's material (apparently a replication of the program at the Attachment Center, Evergreen) as follows:
"Like Welsh ("sic")(1984, 1989), The Center induces rage by physically restraining the child and forcing eye contact with the therapist (the child must lie across the laps of two therapists, looking up at one of them). In a workshop handout prepared by two therapists at The Center, the following sequence of events is described: (1) therapist 'forces control' by holding (which produces child 'rage'); (2) rage leads to child 'capitulation' to the therapist, as indicated by the child breaking down emotionally ('sobbing'); (3) the therapist takes advantage of the child's capitulation by showing nurturance and warmth; (4) this new trust allows the child to accept 'control' by the therapist and eventually the parent. According to The Center's treatment protocol, if the child 'shuts down' ("i.e.", refuses to comply), he or she may be threatened with detainment for the day at the clinic or forced placement in a temporary foster home; this is explained to the child as a consequence of not choosing to be a 'family boy or girl.' If the child is actually placed in foster care, the child is then required to 'earn the way back to therapy' and a chance to resume living with the adoptive family."
According to the APSAC Task Force,
"A central feature of many of these therapies is the use of psychological, physical, or aggressive means to provoke the child to catharsis, ventilation of rage, or other sorts of acute emotional discharge. To do this, a variety of coercive techniques are used, including scheduled holding, binding, rib cage stimulation (e.g., tickling, pinching, knuckling), and/or licking. Children may be held down, may have several adults lie on top of them, or their faces may be held so they can be forced to engage in prolonged eye contact. Sessions may last from 3 to 5 hours, with some sessions reportedly lasting longer... Similar but less physically coercive approaches may involve holding the child and psychologically encouraging the child to vent anger toward her or his biological parent."
The APSAC Task Force describes how the conceptual focus of these treatments is the child's individual internal pathology and past caregivers rather than current parent-child relationships or current environment. If the child is well-behaved outside the home this is seen as successful manipulation of outsiders, rather than as evidence of a problem in the current home or current parent-child relationship. The APSAC Task Force noted that this perspective has its attractions because it relieves the caregivers of responsibility to change aspects of their own behavior and aspirations. Proponents believe that traditional therapies fail to help children with attachment problems because it is impossible to establish a trusting relationship with them. They believe this is because children with attachment problems actively avoid forming genuine relationships. Proponents emphasize the child's resistance to attachment and the need to break it down. In rebirthing and similar approaches, protests of distress from the child are considered to be resistance that must be overcome by more coercion.
Coercive techniques, such as scheduled or enforced holding, may also serve the intended purpose of demonstrating dominance over the child. Establishing total adult control, demonstrating to the child that he or she has no control, and demonstrating that all of the child's needs are met through the adult, is a central tenet of many controversial attachment therapies. Similarly, many controversial treatments hold that children described as attachment–disordered must be pushed to revisit and relive early trauma. Children may be encouraged to regress to an earlier age where trauma was experienced or be reparented through holding sessions. Other features of attachment therapy are the "two week intensive" course of therapy, and the use of "therapeutic foster parents" with whom the child stays whilst undergoing therapy. According to O'Connor and Zeanah, the "holding" approach would be viewed as intrusive and therefore non-sensitive and countertherapeutic, in contrast with accepted theories of attachment.
According to Advocates for Children in Therapy,
"Attachment Therapy almost always involves extremely confrontational, often hostile confrontation of a child by a therapist or parent (sometimes both). Restraint of the child by more powerful adult(s) is considered an essential part of the confrontation." The purported correction is described as "... to force the children into loving (attaching to) their parents; ... there is a hands-on treatment involving physical restraint and discomfort. Attachment Therapy is the imposition of boundary violations – most often coercive restraint – and verbal abuse on a child, usually for hours at a time; ... Typically, the child is put in a lap hold with the arms pinned down, or alternatively an adult lies on top of a child lying prone on the floor."
Psychiatrist Bruce Perry cites the use of holding therapy techniques by caseworkers and foster parents investigating a Satanic Ritual Abuse case in the late 1980s, early 1990s, as instrumental in obtaining lengthy and detailed alleged "disclosures" from children. In his opinion, using force or coercion on traumatised children simply re-traumatizes them and far from producing love and affection, produces obedience based on fear, as in the trauma bond known as Stockholm syndrome.
Parenting techniques.
Therapists often instruct parents to follow programs of treatment at home, for example obedience-training techniques such as "strong sitting" (frequent periods of required silence and immobility) and withholding or limiting food. Earlier authors sometimes referred to this as "German Shepherd training". In some programmes children undergoing the two-week intensive stay with "therapeutic foster parents" for the duration or beyond and the adoptive parents are trained in their techniques.
According to the APSAC Task Force, because it is believed children with attachment problems resist attachment, fight against it and seek to control others to avoid attaching, the child's character flaws must be broken before attachment can occur. Attachment parenting may include keeping the child at home with no social contacts, home schooling, hard labor or meaningless repetitive chores throughout the day, motionless sitting for prolonged periods of time, and control of all food and water intake and bathroom needs. Children described as attachment-disordered are expected by attachment therapists to comply with parental commands "fast and snappy and right the first time", and to always be "fun to be around" for their parents. Deviation from this standard, such as not finishing chores or arguing, is interpreted as a sign of attachment disorder that must be forcibly eradicated. From this perspective, parenting a child with an attachment disorder is a battle, and winning the battle by defeating the child is paramount.
Proper appreciation of total adult control is also considered vital, and information, such as how long a child will be with therapeutic foster parents or what will happen to him or her next, is deliberately withheld. Attachment parenting expert Nancy Thomas states that attachment-disordered children act worse when given information about what is going to occur because they will use the information to manipulate their environment and everyone in it.
In addition to restrictive behavior, parents are advised to provide daily sessions in which older children are treated as if they were babies to create attachment. The child is held in the caregiver's lap, rocked, hugged and kissed, and fed with a bottle and given sweets. These sessions are carried out at the caregiver's wish and not upon the child's request. Attachment therapists believe that reenactments of aspects of infant care have the power to rebuild damaged aspects of early development such as emotional attachment.
Contrasting attachment theory based methods.
In contrast, traditional attachment theory holds that the provision of a safe and predictable environment and caregiver qualities such as sensitivity, responsiveness to children's physical and emotional needs and consistency, support the development of healthy attachment. Therapy based on this viewpoint emphasizes providing a stable environment and taking a calm, sensitive, non-intrusive, non-threatening, patient, predictable, and nurturing approach toward children. Further, as attachment patterns develop within relationships, methods to correct problems with attachment focus on improving the stability and positive qualities of the caregiver-child interactions and relationship. All mainstream interventions with an existing or developing evidential foundation focus on enhancing caregiver sensitivity, creating positive interactions with caregivers, or change of caregiver if that is not possible with existing caregivers. Some interventions focus specifically on increasing caregiver sensitivity in foster parents.
Theoretical principles.
Like a number of other alternative mental health treatments for children, attachment therapy is based on some assumptions that differ strongly from the theoretical foundations of other attachment based therapies. In contrast to traditional attachment theory, the theory of attachment described by attachment therapy proponents is that young children who experience adversity (including maltreatment, loss, separations, adoption, frequent changes in child care, colic or even frequent ear infections) become enraged at a very deep and primitive level. This results in a lack of ability to attach or to be genuinely affectionate to others. Suppressed or unconscious rage is theorized to prevent the child from forming bonds with caregivers and leads to behavior problems when the rage erupts into unchecked aggression. Such children are said to fail to develop a conscience, to not trust others, to seek control rather than closeness, to resist the authority of caregivers, and to engage in endless power struggles. They are seen as highly manipulative and as trying to avoid true attachments while simultaneously striving to control those around them through manipulation and superficial sociability. Such children are said to be at risk of becoming psychopaths who will go on to engage in very serious delinquent, criminal, and antisocial behaviors if left untreated. The tone in which the attributes of these children are described has been characterized as "demonizing".
Advocates of this treatment also believe that emotional attachment of a child to a caregiver begins during the prenatal period, during which the unborn child is aware of the mother's thoughts and emotions. If the mother is distressed by the pregnancy, especially if she considers abortion, the child responds with distress and anger that continue through postnatal life. If the child is separated from the mother after birth, no matter how early this occurs, the child again feels distress and rage that will block attachment to a foster or adoptive caregiver.
If the child has had a peaceful gestation, but after birth suffers pain or ungratified needs during the first year, attachment will again be blocked. If the child reaches the toddler period safely, but is not treated with strict authority during the second year, according to the so-called "attachment cycle", attachment problems will result. Failure of attachment results in a lengthy list of mood and behavior problems, but these may not be revealed until the child is much older. According to attachment therapist Elizabeth Randolph, attachment problems can be diagnosed even in an asymptomatic child through observation of the child's inability to crawl backward on command.
Critics say holding therapies have been promoted as "attachment" therapies, even though they are more antithetical to than consistent with attachment theory, and not based on attachment theory or research. Indeed they are considered incompatible. There are many ways in which holding therapy/attachment therapy contradicts Bowlby's attachment theory, e.g. attachment theory's fundamental and evidence-based statement that security is promoted by sensitivity. According to Mary Dozier "holding therapy does not emanate in any logical way from attachment theory or from attachment research".
Diagnosis and attachment disorder.
Attachment therapists claim to diagnose attachment disorder, and reactive attachment disorder. However, within attachment therapy, the diagnoses of attachment disorder and reactive attachment disorder are used in a manner not recognised in mainstream practice. Prior and Glaser describe two discourses on attachment disorder. One is science-based, found in academic journals and books with careful reference to theory, international classifications and evidence. They list Bowlby, Ainsworth, Tizard, Hodges, Chisholm, O'Connor and Zeanah and colleagues as respected attachment theorists and researchers in the field. The other discourse is found in clinical practice, non-academic literature and on the Internet where claims are made which have no basis in attachment theory and for which there is no empirical evidence. In particular unfounded claims are made as to efficacy of treatments. The Internet is considered essential to the popularization of holding therapy as an "attachment" therapy.
The APSAC Task Force describes the relationship between the proponents of attachment therapy and mainstream therapies as polarized. "This polarization is compounded by the fact that attachment therapy has largely developed outside the mainstream scientific and professional community and flourishes within its own networks of attachment therapists, treatment centers, caseworkers, and parent support groups. Indeed, proponents and critics of the controversial attachment therapies appear to move in different worlds."
Diagnosis lists and questionnaires.
Both the APSAC Task Force and Prior and Glaser describe the proliferation of alternative "lists" and diagnoses, particularly on the Internet, by proponents of attachment therapy, that are not in accord with either DSM or ICD classifications and which are partly based on the unsubstantiated views of Zaslow and Menta and Cline. According to the Task Force, "These types of lists are so nonspecific that high rates of false-positive diagnoses are virtually certain. Posting these types of lists on internet sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders."
Prior and Glaser describe the lists as "wildly inclusive" and state that many of the behaviors in the lists are likely to be the consequences of neglect and abuse rather than located within the attachment paradigm. Descriptions of children are frequently highly pejorative and "demonizing". Examples given from lists of attachment disorder symptoms found on the internet include lying, avoiding eye contact except when lying, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, fascination with fire, blood, gore and evil, food related issues (such as gorging or hoarding), cruelty to animals and lack of conscience. They also give an example from the Evergreen Consultants in Human Behavior which offers a 45-symptom checklist including bossiness, stealing, enuresis and language disorders.
A commonly used diagnostic checklist in attachment therapy is the "Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire" or "RADQ", which originated at the Institute for Attachment in Evergreen. It is presented not as an assessment of reactive attachment disorder but rather attachment disorder. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviors, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like Conduct Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder or are not related to attachment difficulties. It is largely based on the earlier Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist which itself shows considerable overlap with even earlier checklists for indicators of sexual abuse. The Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist includes statements about the parent's feelings toward the child as well as statements about the child's behavior. For example, parental feelings are evaluated through responses to such statements as "Parent feels used" and "is wary of the child's motives if affection is expressed", and "Parents feel more angry and frustrated with this child than with other children". The child's behavior is referred to in such statements as "Child has a grandiose sense of self-importance" and "Child 'forgets' parental instructions or directives". The compiler of the RADQ claims validity by reference to the Attachment Disorder Symptom Checklist. It also purports to diagnose attachment disorder for which there is no classification. A critic has stated that a major problem of the RADQ is that it has not been validated against any established objective measure of emotional disturbance.
Patient recruitment.
In addition to concerns about the use of non-specific diagnostic checklists on the Internet being used as a marketing tool, the Task Force also noted the extreme claims made by proponents as to both the prevalence and effect of attachment disorders. Some proponents suggest most or a high proportion of adopted children are likely to suffer attachment disorder. Statistics on the prevalence of maltreatment are wrongly used to estimate the prevalence of RAD. Problematical or less desirable styles such as insecure or disorganized attachment are conflated with attachment disorder. Children are labeled as "RADs", "RAD-kids" or "RADishes". They are seen as manipulative, dishonest, without conscience and dangerous. Some attachment therapy sites predict that attachment-disordered children will grow up to become violent predators or psychopaths unless they receive the treatment proposed. A sense of urgency is created which serves to justify the application of aggressive and unconventional techniques. One site was noted to contain the argument that Saddam Hussein, Adolf Hitler, and Jeffrey Dahmer, were examples of children who were attachment-disordered who "did not get help in time". Foster Cline in his seminal work on attachment therapy "Hope for high risk and rage filled children" uses the example of Ted Bundy.
In answering the question posed as to how a treatment widely regarded by attachment clinicians and researchers as destructive and unethical came to be linked with attachment theory and to be seen as a viable and useful treatment, O'Connor and Nilson cite the use of the Internet to publicize attachment therapy and the lack of knowledgeable mainstream professionals or appropriate mainstream treatments or interventions. They set out recommendations for the better dissemination of both understanding of attachment theory and knowledge of the more recent evidence-based treatment options available.
Rachel Stryker in her anthropological study ""The Road to Evergreen"" argues that adoptive families of institutionalized children who have difficulties transitioning to a nuclear family are attracted to the Evergreen model despite the controversy, because it legitimises and reanimates the same ideas about family and domesticity as does the adoption process itself, offering renewed hope of "normal" family life. Institutionalized or abused children often do not conform to adopters conceptualizations of family behaviours and roles. The Evergreen model pathologizes the childs behaviour by a medical diagnosis, thus legitimising the family. As well as the promise of working where traditional therapies fail, attachment therapy also offers the idea of attachment as a negotiable social contract that can be enforced in order to convert the unsatisfactory adoptee into the "emotional asset" the family requires. By the use of confrontation the model offers the means to condition children to comply with parental expectations. Where the therapy fails to achieve this the fault is attributed to the child's conscious choice to not be a family member, or the child's inability to perform as family material.
Contrasting mainstream position.
Within mainstream practice, disorders of attachment are classified in DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 as reactive attachment disorder (generally known as RAD), and Disinhibited attachment disorder. Both classification systems warn against automatic diagnosis based on abuse or neglect. Many symptoms are present in a variety of other more common and more easily treatable disorders. There is as yet no other accepted definition of attachment disorders.
According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) practice parameter published in 2005, the question of whether attachment disorders can be reliably diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence.
Prevalence.
Attachment therapy prospered during the 1980s and '90s as a consequence of both the influx of older adopted orphans from Eastern European and third world countries and the inclusion of reactive attachment disorder in the 1980 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders which attachment therapists adopted as an alternative name for their existing unvalidated diagnosis of attachment disorder.
According to the APSAC Task Force, these therapies are sufficiently prevalent to have prompted position statements or specific prohibitions against using coercion or restraint as a treatment by mainstream professional societies such as: American Psychological Association (Division on Child Maltreatment), National Association of Social Workers (and its Utah Chapter), American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and American Psychiatric Association. The Association for the Treatment and Training in the Attachment of Children, (ATTACh), an organization for professionals and families associated with attachment therapy, has also issued statements against coercive practices. Two American states, Colorado and North Carolina, have outlawed rebirthing. There have been professional licensure sanctions against some leading proponents and successful criminal prosecutions and imprisonment of therapists and parents using attachment therapy techniques. Despite this, the treatments appear to be continuing among networks of attachment therapists, attachment therapy centers, caseworkers, and adoptive or foster parents. The advocacy group ACT states, "Attachment Therapy is a growing, underground movement for the 'treatment' of children who pose disciplinary problems to their parents or caregivers."
Rachel Stryker in her anthropological study "The Road to Evergreen" states that attachment therapies "of all stripes" are increasingly popular in the USA and that the number of therapists associated with the Evergreen model registering with ATTACh grows each year. She cites the large number of formerly institutionalized domestic and foreign adoptees in the USA and the apparently higher risk of disruption of foreign adoptions, of which there were 216,000 between 1998 and 2008.
The practice of holding therapy is not confined to the US. Prior and Glaser cite at least one clinic in the UK. Attachment therapists from the USA have conducted conferences in the UK. The British Association for Adoption and Fostering, (BAAF), has issued an extensive position statement on the subject which covers not only physical coercion but also the underlying theoretical principles. It had been thought, until recently, that therapists calling themselves "attachment therapists" practising in the UK tended to be practising conventional forms of psychotherapy based on attachment theory. In 2009 The British Journal of Social Work accepted an article rehabilitating holding therapy, "To Have and to Hold: Questions about a Therapeutic Service for Children" describing an earlier study involving the Keys Attachment Centre in Rossendale, Lancashire and the surrounding Keys Attachment Homes. In 2012, first-hand accounts from a survivor and a number of professionals provided evidence that the coercive Evergreen model of holding therapy had been systematically used to treat children in Local Authority care within a programme in North West England.
Developments.
The APSAC Task Force stated that proponents of attachment therapy correctly point out that most critics have never actually observed any of the treatments they criticize or visited any of the centers where the controversial therapies are practiced. Proponents argue that their therapies present no physical risk if undertaken properly and that critics' concerns are based on unrepresentative occurrences and misapplications of techniques, or misunderstanding by parents. Holding is described as gentle or nurturing and it is maintained that intense, cathartic approaches are necessary to help children with attachment disorders. Their evidence for this is primarily clinical experience and testimonials.
According to the APSAC Task Force, there are controversies within the attachment therapy community about coercive practices. There has been a move away from coercive and confrontational models towards attunement and emotional regulation amongst some leaders in the field, notably Hughes, Kelly and Popper. A number of therapies are quite different from those that have led to the abuse and deaths of children in much publicized court cases. The Task Force, however, points out that all the therapies, including those using frankly coercive practices, present themselves as humane, respectful and nurturing, therefore caution is advised. Some practitioners condemn the most dangerous techniques but continue to practice other coercive techniques. Others have taken a public stand against coercion. The Task Force was of the view that all could benefit from more transparency and specificity as to how the therapy is behaviorally delivered.
In 2001, 2003 and 2006, ATTACh, an organization set up by Foster Cline and associates, issued a series of statements in which they progressively changed their stance on coercive practices. In 2001, after the death of Candace Newmaker they stated "The child will never be restrained or have pressure put on them in such a manner that would interfere with their basic life functions such as breathing, circulation, temperature, etc." A White Paper, formally accepted in April 2007, "unequivocally state(s) our opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting." They acknowledge ATTACh's historical links with catharsis, provocation of rage, and intense confrontation, among other overtly coercive techniques (and indeed continue to offer for sale books by controversial proponents) but state that the organization has evolved significantly away from earlier positions. They state that their recent evolution is due to a number of factors including tragic events resulting from such techniques, an influx of members practicing other techniques such as attunement and a "fundamental shift ... away from viewing these children as driven by a conscious need for control toward an understanding that their often controlling and aggressive behaviors are automatic, learned defensive responses to profoundly overwhelming experiences of fear and terror." While being of the view that authoritative practices are necessary, and that nurturing touch and treatment aimed at the perceived developmental rather than chronological age are an integral part of the therapy, the White Paper promotes the techniques of attunement, sensitivity and regulation and deprecates coercive practices such as enforced holding or enforced eye contact.
History.
Matthew Speltz of the University of Washington School of Medicine states that the roots of attachment therapy are traceable to psychologist Robert Zaslow and his "Z-process" in the 1970s. Zaslow attempted to force attachment in those suffering from autism by creating rage while holding them against their will. He believed this would lead to a breakdown in their defense mechanisms, making them more receptive to others. Zaslow thought attachment arose when an infant experienced feelings of pain, fear and rage, and then made eye contact with the carer who relieved those feelings. If an infant did not experience this cycle of events by having his fear and rage relieved, the infant would not form an attachment and would not make eye contact with other people. Zaslow believed that creating pain and rage and combining them with eye contact would cause attachment to occur, long after the normal age for such developments. Holding therapies derive from these "rage-reduction" techniques applied by Zaslow. The holding is not used for safety purposes but is initiated for the purpose of provoking strong negative emotions such as fear and anger. The child's release typically depends upon his or her compliance with the therapist's clinical agenda or goals. In 1971, Zaslow surrendered his California psychology license following an injury to a patient during rage-reduction therapy. Zaslow's ideas on the use of the Z-process and holding for autism have been dispelled by research on the
genetic/biologic causes of autism.
Zaslow and his "Z-process", a physically rough version of holding therapy, influenced Foster Cline (known as the "father of attachment therapy") and associates at his clinic in Evergreen A key tenet of Zaslow's approach was the notion of "breaking through" a child's defenses—based on the model of ego defenses borrowed from psychoanalytic theory, which critics state has been misapplied. The "breaking through" metaphor was then applied to children whose attachments were thought to be impaired. The clinic, originally called the Youth Behavior Program, was subsequently renamed the Attachment Center at Evergreen.
In 1983, ethologist Nikolas Tinbergen published a book recommending the use of holding therapy by parents as a treatment or "cure" for autistic children. Tinbergen based his ideas on his methods of observational study of birds. Parents were advised to hold their autistic children despite resistance and to endeavor to maintain eye contact and share emotions. Tinbergen believed that autism related to a failure in the bond between mother and child caused by "traumatic influences" and that enforced holding and eye contact could establish such a relationship and rescue the child from autism. Tinbergen's interpretations of autism were without scientific rigor and were contrary to the then growing acceptance that autism had a genetic cause. Despite the lack of a sound theoretical or scientific base, holding therapy as a treatment for autism is still practiced in some parts of the world, notably Europe.
Speltz cites child psychiatrist Martha Welch and her 1988 book, "Holding Time", as the next significant development. Like Zaslow and Tinbergen, Welch recommended holding therapy as a treatment for autism. Like Tinbergen, Welch believed autism was caused by the failure of the attachment relationship between mother and child. Mothers were instructed to hold their defiant child, provoking anger and rage, until such time as the child ceased to resist, at which point a bonding process was believed to begin.
Foster Cline and associates at the Attachment Center at Evergreen, Colorado began to promote the use of the same or similar holding techniques with adopted, maltreated children who were said to have an "attachment disorder". This was replicated elsewhere such as at "The Center" in the Pacific Northwest. A number of other clinics arose in Evergreen, Colorado, set up by those involved in or trained at the Attachment Center at Evergreen (renamed the Institute for Attachment and Development in about 2002). These included one set up by Connell Watkins, formerly an associate of Foster Cline at the Attachment Center and its clinical director. Watkins was one of the therapists convicted in the Candace Newmaker case in 2001 in which a child was asphyxiated during a rebirthing process in the course of a two-week attachment therapy "intensive". Foster Cline gave up his license and moved to another state following an investigation of a separate attachment therapy related incident.
In addition to the notion of "breaking through" defence mechanisms, other metaphors were adopted by practitioners relating to the supposed effects of early deprivation, abuse or neglect on the child's ability to form relationships. These included the idea of the child's development being "frozen" and treatment being required to "unfreeze" development. Practitioners of holding therapy also added some components of Bowlby's attachment theory and the therapy came to be known as attachment therapy. Language from attachment theory is used but descriptions of the practices contain ideas and techniques based on misapplied metaphors deriving from Zaslow and psychoanalysis, not attachment theory. According to Prior and Glaser "there is no empirical evidence to support Zaslow's theory. The concept of suppressed rage has, nevertheless, continued to be a central focus explaining the children's behavior."
Cline's privately published work "Hope for high risk and rage filled children" also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints parts of a case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes the case of a divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child for hours at a time and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child did increase in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.
In addition, proponents believed that holding induced age regression, enabling a child to make up for physical affection missed earlier in life. Regression is key to the holding therapy approach. In attachment therapy, breaking down the child's resistance by confrontational techniques is thought to reduce the child to an infantile state, thus making the child receptive to forming attachment by the application of early parenting behaviors such as bottle feeding, cradling, rocking and eye contact. Some, but by no means all, attachment therapists have used rebirthing techniques to aid regression. The roots of the form of rebirthing used within attachment therapy lie in primal therapy (sometimes known as primal scream therapy), another therapy based on beliefs in very early trauma and the transformational nature of age regression. Bowlby explicitly rejected the notion of regression stating "present knowledge of infant and child development requires that a theory of developmental pathways should replace theories that invoke specific phases of development in which it is held a person may become fixated and/or to which he may regress."
According to O'Connor and Nilsen, although other aspects of treatment are applied, the holding component has attracted most attention because proponents believe it is an essential ingredient. They also considered the lack of available and suitable interventions from mainstream professionals as essential to the popularization of holding therapy as an attachment therapy.
In 2003, an issue of "Attachment & Human Development" was devoted to the subject of attachment therapy with articles by well-known experts in the field of attachment. Attachment researchers and authors condemned it as empirically unfounded, theoretically flawed and clinically unethical. It has also been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, not based on attachment theory or research, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children including at least six documented child fatalities. In 2006, the American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC) Task Force reported on the subjects of attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems and laid down guidelines for the future diagnosis and treatment of attachment disorders. The APSAC Task Force was largely critical of Attachment Therapy's theoretical base, practices, claims to an evidence base, non-specific symptoms lists published on the internet, claims that traditional treatments do not work and dire predictions for the future of children who do not receive attachment therapy. "Although focused primarily on specific attachment therapy techniques, the controversy also extends to the theories, diagnoses, diagnostic practices, beliefs, and social group norms supporting these techniques, and to the patient recruitment and advertising practices used by their proponents." In 2007, Scott Lilienfeld included holding therapy as one of the potentially harmful therapies (PHT's) at level 1 in his "Psychological Science" review. Describing it as "unfortunately" referred to as "attachment therapy", Mary Dozier and Michael Rutter consider it critical to differentiate it from treatments derived from attachment theory. A mistaken association between attachment therapy and attachment theory may have resulted in a relatively unenthusiastic view towards the latter among some practitioners despite its relatively profound lines of research in the field of socioemotional development.
Claims.
According to the APSAC Task Force, proponents of attachment therapy commonly assert that their therapies alone are effective for attachment-disordered children and that traditional treatments are ineffective or harmful. The APSAC Task Force expressed concern over claims by therapies to be "evidence-based", or the "only" evidence-based therapy, when the Task Force found no credible evidence base for any such therapy so advertised. Nor did it accept more recent claims to evidence base in its November 2006 Reply.
Two approaches on which published studies have been undertaken are holding therapy and dyadic developmental psychotherapy. Each of these non-randomized studies concluded that the treatment method studied was effective. Both the APSAC Task Force and Prior and Glaser cite and criticize the one published study on holding therapy undertaken by Myeroff et al., which "purports to be an evaluation of holding therapy". This study covers the "across the lap" approach, described as "not restraint" by Howe and Fearnley but "being held whilst unable to gain release." Prior and Glaser state that although the Myeroff study claims it is based on attachment theory, the theoretical basis for the treatment is in fact Zaslow.
Dyadic developmental psychotherapy was developed by psychologist Daniel Hughes, described by the Task Force as a "leading attachment therapist". Hughes' website gave a list of attachment therapy techniques, repeated by the APSAC Task Force from an earlier website, which he stated do not or should not form part of dyadic developmental psychotherapy, which the Task Force took as a description of attachment therapy techniques. Two studies on dyadic developmental psychotherapy have been published by Dr. Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow up of the first. Prior and Glaser state Hughes' therapy reads as good therapy for abused and neglected children, though with "little application of attachment theory", but the advocacy group ACT and the Task Force place Hughes within the attachment therapy paradigm.
In 2004, Saunders, Berliner and Hanson developed a system of categories for social work interventions which has proved somewhat controversial. In their first analysis, holding therapy was placed in Category 6 as a "Concerning treatment". In 2006 Craven and Lee classified 18 studies in a literature review under the Saunders, Berliner & Hanson system. They considered both dyadic developmental psychotherapy and holding therapy. They placed both in Category 3 as "Supported and acceptable". This categorization by Craven and Lee has been criticized as unduly favorable, a point to which Craven and Lee responded by arguments in support of holding therapy. Both Myeroff et al.'s study and Becker-Weidman's first study (published after the main Report) were examined in the Task Force's November 2006 Reply to Letters and were criticized as to their methodology. Becker-Weidman's study was described by the Task Force as "an important first step toward learning the facts about DDP outcomes" but falling far short of the criteria necessary to constitute an evidence base.
Some studies are still being undertaken on coercive therapies. A nonrandomized, before-and-after 2006 pilot study by Welch (the progenitor of "holding time") et al. on Welch's "prolonged parent-child embrace therapy" was conducted on children with a range of diagnoses for behavioral disorders and claimed to show significant improvement.
In March 2007, attachment therapy was placed on a list of treatments that have the potential to cause harm to clients in the APS journal, "Perspectives on Psychological Science". Concern was expressed about methods that involve holding and restraint, and the lack of randomized, controlled experiments showing the effectiveness of the treatment.
In 2010 a modest social work study and "invitation to a debate", based on interviews with the deliverers and recipients of a therapeutic intervention incorporating non-coercive holding at one centre in the UK, called for further consideration of the use of this type of intervention. The intervention was not described as "holding therapy" but as using a degree of holding in the course of therapy. Although recipients were generally positive about the therapy received, the holding aspect was the least liked. The authors call for research and a debate on issues of what constitutes "coercion" and the distinctions between the different variants of "holding" in therapy.
Controversy.
There have been a number of cases of serious harm to children in which controversial attachment therapy techniques, theories or belief systems have been implicated. An estimated six children have died as a consequence of the more coercive forms of such treatments or the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.

Oaks d'Italia

The Oaks d'Italia is a Group 2 flat horse race in Italy open to three-year-old thoroughbred fillies. It is run at Milan over a distance of 2,200 metres (about 1 mile and 3 furlongs), and it is scheduled to take place each year in May or June.
It is Italy's equivalent of the Epsom Oaks, a famous race in England.
History.
The event has been contested over 2,200 metres for most of its history, and for a period it held Group 1 status. Its distance was extended to 2,400 metres in 1988, and it reverted to 2,200 metres in 1995. The race was downgraded to Group 2 level in 2007.
The Oaks d'Italia is currently held about three weeks after the Derby Italiano.

Creation Fest

Creation Fest is a free Christian music festival, which takes place on the first weekend of August in the Royal Cornwall Showground, Cornwall England.
History.
The California-based Calvary Chapel established a church 'plant' (a new congregation) in Woolacombe, North Devon, in 2000. The following year the church members were given a vision to put on a Christian music festival, and Creation Fest was born.
The first festival was in the summer of 2002 as a one-day event and has grown as an event to a three-day festival. The festival was originally based in Woolacombe, and ministered to the people of North Devon as well as people from all over the world. The organisers want to see local churches getting involved as much as possible and for the event to be a blessing and a reaping ground for those churches. They also want to partner with churches nationally and internationally to fulfil the Great Commission.
The festival was held in Woolacombe until 2008. The 2009 festival was held at the Royal Cornwall Showground in Wadebridge (the field used for the festival in Woolacombe became unavailable).
Aims.
Creation Fest exists with the aim to promote Christianity through contemporary Christian music. They also desire to see Christians established in the basics of Christianity, the authority of the scripture proclaimed and Churches brought together in unity.

Harold Everard Monteagle Barlow FRS (15 November 1899 – 20 April 1989) was a British engineer.
He was born in Islington, London, the son of Leonard Barlow, an electrical engineer. He entered University College, London where, apart from the WWII years (which he spent ar Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough), he spent most of his working life. He was taught by Ambrose Fleming, who held the Pender Chair there. Barlow went on to succeed Fleming in that chair, and hence also in the post of head of department. Among his students, Barlow supervised Charles Kao, the 2009 Nobel Laureate for Physics, for a doctoral degree.
Honours and awards.
In March, 1961 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His application citation stated that he: "" Has made important contributions to the devising of improved measuring techniques at centimetre wavelengths. In particular has developed methods of measuring centimetre-wave power by radiation pressure and by use of the Hall Effect in semi-conductors; has made detailed studies of the conductor loss in wave guides and has added substantially to knowledge on the characteristics of surface waves. His further application of the Hall Effect to power measurement at low frequencies is likely to prove of considerable electrical engineering value. He has published two books on centimetre-wave measurements and some 35 scientific and technical papers"." 
In 1988, Barlow was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in Engineering category, ""In recognition of his distinguished research, particularly on microwaves and waveguides, and of his lasting influence as the founder of an unusually productive research school.""

Card Player Magazine credits Australian Keith Sloan with developing the speed poker variant. Although theoretically any poker variant could be played in a speed format, to date only Texas hold 'em has been widely played.
Mansion Ltd subsequently purchased the rights to Sloan's concept Speed Poker, and have since developed and trademarked Mansion Speed Poker.
Game play, hand rankings, etc., are identical to standard Texas hold 'em. The differences in rules mostly relate to the time players have to act on their hands. Each player has 15 seconds to act before his or her hand is ruled dead (or checked if there has been no previous action). Players are given one or more 30 second time extensions which they may use on any turn. In the Mansionpoker.net Poker Dome Challenge, pre-flop play is pot limit; post-flop play is no limit. In the World Speed Poker Open all play was no limit.

Palaeeudyptes gunnari

Palaeeudyptes gunnari was a species of the extinct penguin genus "Palaeeudyptes". It was a bit smaller than its congener "Palaeeudyptes antarcticus" of New Zealand, standing between 110 and 125 cm high, approximately the size of the Emperor Penguin. It is known from dozens of fossil bones from Middle or Late Eocene strata (34-50 MYA) of the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, Antarctica. Initially, it was described as a separate genus, "Eosphaeniscus". However, this was based on a single weathered and broken tarsometatarsus. Better material recovered later showed that the species belongs into the present genus.
"Wimanornis" is probably a synonym of this species (Jadwiszcak, 2006).

Midland Reafforesting Association

The Midland Reafforesting Association (MRA) was an early environmental organisation concerned with facilitating the planting of trees on land degraded by previous industrial activity. Such work was motivated by the aims of promoting landscape enhancement, improving the local environment and achieving the restoration of land to more productive land uses. 
Based in the Black Country, the Association were formally established at a public meeting in the city of Birmingham on the 12th February 1903. The first President of the Association was Sir Oliver Lodge - a distinguished scientist of the day and pioneer of wireless telegraphy. Other notable supporters included the future Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, the Earl of Dudley and Henry Norman. By being registered as a Friendly Society, the Association was able to own its own land. It also planted on private and council owned land - often using trees raised from seed in the Association's own nurseries. 
Achieving some significant successes in promoting tree planting, arranging Arbor Days and furthering the scientific understanding of restoring degraded land, the MRA were ultimately largely unsuccessful in delivering large scale afforestation in the Black Country and were wound up in 1925. Their legacy however remains - not least in their largest plantation at a hospital site called Moorcroft which was named a Local Nature Reserve in 1996, and also in the form of the Country Urban Forest, a Project which greatly increased tree cover in the Black Country between 1995 and 2005.

James Penny

James Penny (died 1799) was a merchant, slaveship owner and prominent anti-abolitionist in Liverpool, England. He defended the slave trade to the British Parliament. Penny Lane in Liverpool, later immortalized by The Beatles, is thought to be named after him.
Early life.
Penny was probably not a native of Liverpool and may have been born in Ulverston. He came to Liverpool to work as a mariner and was married to Ann Cooper in 1768. He is subsequently referred to as a mariner, ship's captain and merchant in Liverpool directories. 
Penny was active in the slave trade until the American War of Independence. He returned to the trade after the war as a shipowner and as a business partner with other traders. He was involved in several slave trading companies and was known for his knowledge of the African coast derived from his many journeys dating back to 1776. 
When in 1788, the British government launched an inquiry into the slave trade, following public pressure from abolitionists, Penny was chosen to represent the views of slavers. According to local historian F.E. Sanderson, he was a "man of considerable stature in the town, highly regarded by his fellow merchants, his forthright views on the slave trade must have brought him to their notice as a likely delegate".
Evidence to Parliament.
In the evidence he gave the British Government, Penny claimed that "he found himself impelled, both by humanity and interest, to pay every possible attention both to the preservation of the crew and the slaves." He stated that he allowed the slaves on the Atlantic Slave route to play games and dance and sing.
In the same body of evidence, he notes that the fatality rate for his slaves was one in twelve, and that "The average allowance of width to a slave is fourteen and two-thirds inches." Penny also argued that abolition of the trade would destroy the economy of Liverpool; "it would not only greatly affect the commercial interest, but also the landed property of the County of Lancaster and more particularly, the Town of Liverpool; whose fall, in that case, would be as rapid as its rise has been astonishing."
Later life.
In 1792 he was presented with a silver epergne for speaking in favour of the slave trade to a parliamentary committee. He continued to be committed to the slave trade even when other merchants were moving away from it. With his eldest son, James, he was elected to the African Company of Merchants trading in Liverpool in July 1793. He died in 1799.
One of Penny's daughters married the writer Christopher North.

Tidarren

Tidarren is a genus of spiders. The males are much smaller than females.
The males of this genus amputate one of their palps before maturation and enter their adult life with one palp only. It is assumed that this is done to increase mobility, as the palps are disproportionately large compared to the size of the body.
In the Yemeni species "Tidarren argo", the remaining palp is then torn off by the female. Spider males use their palp to transfer semen into the female. The separated palp remains attached to the female's epigynum for about four hours and apparently continues to function independently. In the meantime the female feeds on the palpless male.
Distribution.
"Tidarren" species occur in Africa, and in Middle and South America.

Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts

The Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts (or CCPA) is a entertainment and music venue located in the Cerritos Towne Center of Cerritos, California. It is owned and operated by the City of Cerritos and it opened its doors to the public on January 9, 1993 and hosts opera, cabaret, jazz, dance, magic, drama, musicals and comedy performances as well as private functions. Its season runs from August to May.
History and architecture.
Plans for the construction of a community theater had been proposed in the Cerritos Towne Center since 1986, however, debate as to the size and influence of the theater vis-à-vis other venues in Southern California persisted. Fears primarily included having a large theater with few patrons in attendance.
The consultants, David Staples and Wally Russell of Theatre Projects Consultants from London, calmed fears and inspired city leaders with the details of Derngate Theatre in Northampton, England, where blocks of seats on rollers could be rearranged or removed completely, tailored to each performance. At the time, nothing like it existed in the United States. 
Architects Barton Myers Associates of Los Angeles were hired to design a similar marvel for Cerritos. Once worries were abated, it was decided that a large venue that could compete with the likes of the Long Beach Terrace Theater, Orange County Performing Arts Center, and the Los Angeles Music Center would be a better direction for the development of the community theater. In 1987, the layout plans included an auditorium with six distinct seating configurations, a conference center and a 200-seat theater with its own sound and lighting systems. Construction began shortly on a city landmark that incorporates glass walls, pink limestone, colorful ceramic tiles and angular points and projections. A glass elevator tower topped with pyramids, thin spires and pennants completed the final façade. The interior includes a lobby featuring a curved grand staircase with etched glass, stylish fireplace, soaring ceiling and artwork. Though initially budgeted $17 million for the development, the final price tag came out to be over $60 million.
More than 6,000 visitors attended the open house tours upon the CCPA's completion. With a $4 million spending budget to attract performances in its inaugural season, the CCPA's sold out opening night welcomed crooner Frank Sinatra for three nights, helping establish the Cerritos Center as a premier venue in the Southland.
The city council realized that it would take several seasons to build up an audience to make the Cerritos Center self-supporting, so a $2 million subsidy or pump-priming fund was budgeted to augment the annual $3 million from ticket sales and pay operating costs and performers. [http://www.ci.cerritos.ca.us/library/history/chapter9.html]
Seating configurations.
There are six seating configurations in the auditorium of the CCPA, made possible by moving seating towers and mobile seating wagons, multiple floor lifts and moving ceiling panels. It takes about eight hours or less to switch from one configuration to another.
Facilities.
The "Sierra Room/Sierra Theater" at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts features a technologically advanced grid of tracks and moveable partitions, which can divide the space from one large open room to five smaller meeting places. A hidden retractable seating unit can be opened into part of the room creating the Sierra Room Theater, perfect for fashion shows, guest speakers and presentations. Additional amenities available include a state-of-the-art sound system, lighting and a dance floor for parties and wedding receptions. [http://www.cerritoscenter.com/sierra.cfm]
The "Mojave Room" as well as the "Grand Lobby" can be rented out for small business meetings, luncheons and receptions. [http://www.cerritoscenter.com/mojave.cfm]
Awards and recognition.
In 1994, the CCPA received the United States Institute of Theater Technology's (USITT) highest honor, hailing the theater as "The most sophisticated project we've seen in terms of architecture, technology and urban design." "Performance Magazine" also acknowledged the Center's accomplishments, naming it the number one theater in California (under 3,000 seats) for the third consecutive year.

List of High Commissioners of New Zealand to Fiji

The High Commissioner from New Zealand to Fiji is New Zealand's foremost diplomatic representative in the Republic of the Fiji Islands, and in charge of New Zealand's diplomatic mission in Fiji.
The High Commission is located in Suva, Fiji's capital city. New Zealand first maintained a resident Head of Mission in Fiji since 1970. The Ambassador to Fiji is concurrently accredited to Nauru and Tuvalu.
As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, diplomatic relations between New Zealand and Fiji are at governmental level, rather than between Heads of State. Thus, the countries exchange High Commissioners, rather than ambassadors. Between 1987 and 1997, this was not the case; after the Coups of 1987, Fiji was expelled from the Commonwealth, but rejoined after the promulgation of a new constitution in 1997. Hence, from 1987 until 1997, New Zealand was represented in Fiji by an ambassador.

Your Missus Is a Nutter

"Your Missus is a Nutter" is a song by the Welsh satirical rap act Goldie Lookin Chain. It has more of a "rock" sound than their previous records, heavily drawing on a sample taken from Serge Gainsbourg's song cannabis.
The video for the song, directed by Ben Ib is based on the film "Weird Science", spoofing the section where the boys wear bras on their heads and create a woman on a computer who becomes real. The "nutter missus" in the video also closely resembles the character of Regan from the film "The Exorcist".
"Your Missus is a Nutter" is the first single from the group's second album, "Safe as Fuck".
The single reached #14 in the UK. They dedicated the song to Victoria Beckham, which resulted in them being summoned by the Newport mayor's office, who also objected to the title of their album, "Safe as Fuck".
In a further controversial incident in 2005, GLC were invited by the Football Association of Wales to perform before the World Cup Qualifying match against England at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the nature of the band's music and the participation of England star David Beckham, the band dedicated "Your Missus is a Nutter" to the footballer's wife, who was present at the match. The ensuing furore, with the Welsh football authorities having to apologise to the Beckhams as well as expressing outrage at the band's perceived lack of respect, prompted many people to question exactly why the organisers had hired them to play in the first place.

<doc id="5885511" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5885511" title="Michael Corinthos">
Michael Corinthos

Michael Corinthos III (né Morgan) is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, "General Hospital". Born onscreen in 1997, the role was portrayed by several child actors, most notably Dylan Cash when the character was rapidly aged in 2002. In 2009, the character was aged again when Drew Garrett stepped into the role. Garrett was replaced by Chad Duell after only a year with the series.
As the son of A.J. Quartermaine and Carly Corinthos, nephew of mob enforcer Jason Morgan, and adoptive son of mob boss, Sonny Corinthos, he is born into chaos. Taken from A.J. as a child, Michael is raised at the center of a bitter battle between his biological family, the wealthy Quartermaines, and the Corinthos family. The character's most significant storylines include his accidental shooting of Kate Howard, his own shooting and waking from a coma in 2009, the murder of his step-mother Claudia Zacchara and being sent to prison where he was raped, and his grandmother Monica Quartermaine being upset over the loss of her grandson (until A.J. tells Monica what happened to Michael).
In 2012, Michael is reunited with his biological father which puts him back in the middle of the ongoing battle between his parents once again. The character has had significant relationships with former exotic dancer, Abby Haver and "One Life to Live's", Starr Manning. Most recently, the character has embraced his biological roots, and is currently in the midst of a romantic triangle involving his brother, Morgan and love interest Kiki Jerome. Michael spent the majority of his life trying to emulate his adoptive father, but has since matured into his own man. However, he has a habit of sacrificing himself for the good of others. Most recently, he has strayed away from that path.
Casting and portrayals.
Born on-screen on December 29, 1997, the role was originated by child actors Blake and Dylan Hopkins. The twin actors were replaced by Tiarnan Cunningham in 2001, who stayed with the series until 2002. On March 28, 2002, Dylan Cash made his first appearance as Michael, aging the character and revising his birth year to 1995. After three years with the series, Cash signed a contract in April 2005. In March 2008, rumors began circulating that Cash's contract was about to expire and would not be renewed, and by April several sources confirmed the fact. "BuddyTV" reported that Cash was blindsided by his firing, and confirmed the series was considering aging the character. It was also rumored that ABC was considering "As the World Turns's", Jesse Lee Soffer for the role. Cash made his last appearance as a contract cast member on May 16, 2008, briefly reprising the role for one episode on December 29, 2008.
Drew Garrett.
In March 2009, after months of speculation, it was confirmed by "TV Guide" that soap newcomer, Drew Garrett had been cast in the role and would make his debut on April 24, 2009. The casting of Garrett also confirmed the character's SORAS aging; Michael would now be seventeen, revising the character's birth year to 1991. Garrett revealed that he first auditioned for the role of with Laura Wright, who portrayed Michael's mother, Carly. After about three weeks of waiting, Garrett finally was asked to return for a session with the producers. At this time, Garrett was still unaware of the role he was auditioning for, knowing it only to be "Michael," and a week later his agent told him his follow up screen test was cancelled and that he was the new Michael Corinthos. On March 22, 2010, several reports surfaced confirming that Drew Garrett had been let go from the series, and the role of Michael was to be recast. Drew Garrett made his finale appearance in the role of Michael on April 19, 2010.
Garrett's Michael is very rebellious, and edgy. He is all about exploring, "stirring up trouble and crossing boundaries." The bad behavior is Michael's way of reclaiming the life he's lost. He wants to live a full life, without limitations and believes embracing danger is the way to do it. Michael is in complete denial about how much has changed. Michael is not in anyway thinking about his future. He is just worried about how he can get the most excitement out of the life he currently has. Michael refuses to take no for an answer which often gets him into trouble. According to Garrett, Michael does not believe he has any other options in life which is why he is determined to work for his father. Michael stubbornly refuses to accept that working for Sonny is not an option. Things are further complicated when Michael cannot control emotions. What makes matters worse is that Michael does not know why he gets so angry; the not knowing perpetuates the anger.
Chad Duell.
Chad Duell made his first appearance in the role of Michael on April 20, 2010. In an interview with Crushable.com, Duell revealed that he auditioned around the same time as Garrett in 2009, but Garrett was awarded the role. The producers had begun developing a new role for Michael's sister, Kristina Davis (Lexi Ainsworth)'s, love interest, which Duell also auditioned for. His performance was so well received that at the expiration of Garrett's contract, Duell was cast as Michael, and the other character was scrapped. "They had a certain feel about how they wanted and now, I guess they're going in this direction," Duell told "Soap Opera Digest". In January 2012, a casting call for the character of Erik was released leading to speculation that Duell was about to be replaced as Michael. Duell later took to Twitter with a simple response to fans inquiry about him possibly being replaced, "I'm not."Duell described his character as being very multi-layered, having a lot of baggage, but also a great heart. He says that Michael loves his family, and wants to make his father proud, which in Duell's eyes, is what makes the character so interesting; "He's very complex. He's got so many things going on at once... He's an awesome kid but he's had it very rough." According to Duell, Michael is a tough kid who angers easily, who is torn between being a good guy, but is afraid to feel weak. "I like showing more sides to him. I want (to show) his heart more than his anger. I don’t want him to be one way." According to Duell, Michael is "never just one way. There's always something behind everything." Duell's ability to bring complexity to Michael is what he believes led to the recast. Duell described Michael as being "a very strong kid.…He's strong for his father, above all. He has thick enough skin to get through a lot of things."
Development.
Shootings and coma (2007–08).
From November 2007 to February 2008, then headwriter, Robert Guza temporarily vacated his post during the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike and was temporarily replaced by Garin Wolf. It was during this time that the first gun violence storyline with Michael unfolded and Michael accidentally shoots Kate Howard (Megan Ward). Though his family uncovers his involvement in the shooting, Michael does not face any consequences. When Guza returned to his post as head writer, rumors circulated on Internet message boards that Michael would be the next casualty of a mob war. According to one poster, Michael would be left comatose in order to "spirit the character off the canvas and ignite the current true-loving Jason's bloodlust for the Zaccharas." It was originally speculated that the character would be killed off the show entirely. The storyline culminated on April 4, 2008 and the character ends up in a coma.It was Guza's belief that the most appropriate way to address fan disapproval of the lack of consequences for Michael's recent actions was to have Michael take a bullet himself. According to Guza, the incident also forces—Sonny, Carly, Jason, and Jax—the adults in Michael's life to reevaluate their choices. Guza's dialogue for the Johnny Zacchara character expresses that all four are to blame, stating, "kill each other for power and money and turn around and lie and say that we have honor, that we protect family, that women and children are safe." However, Michael's shooting would not completely do away with the violence in the show. It instead serves as a catalyst forcing those around Michael to make life-altering decisions.
Return, rebellion, and murder (2009).
With the announcement of Garrett's casting, many questioned how the character would return to the canvas. Michael finally wakes up on May 18, 2009, with cousin Lulu Spencer (Julie Marie Berman) at his bedside. The now 17-year-old Michael must battle significant health complications before becoming a "normal" teenager. After a risky surgery to keep Michael from slipping into a persistent vegetative state, Michael wakes up. Garrett explained that while Michael healed physically, his mental and emotional health would cause drama. Because Michael and his adoptive half-sister Kristina Davis (Lexi Ainsworth) have very little contact growing up, the writers considered developing a romance between the two. Garrett believed that if either of them were to develop feelings, it would be Kristina, as Michael is too preoccupied with his recovery. Michael is immediately angry with Carly for not being present when he opens his eyes, and believes she is trying to replace him by having another child. The storyline also allows for further development of Michael's relationship with Jason, who also suffered from a brain injury when he was a little older than Michael. Jason becomes Michael's confidant. The story also featured a guest appearance on the June 29, 2009 episode from then Arizona Diamondbacks Outfielder, Connor Jackson, as Michael's physical therapist.
In the meantime, Michael's new step-mother, Claudia Zacchara (Sarah Brown), begins fishing for information trying to figure out if Michael remembers her bedside confessions about her involvement in his shooting. During his recovery, Michael takes a liking to Claudia as his step-mother, according to Garrett "because she tells me what I want to hear," and though she starts out trying to manipulate him, Claudia actually comes to care for him, and Michael sees this. Michael even goes so far as to label Claudia as being "cool." This does not sit well with Jason who suspects Claudia of having something to do with the shooting that landed Michael in a coma. In the summer of 2009, as Claudia begins to grow paranoid, she gets into a car accident which leads to her suffering a miscarriage. Michael is believed to be responsible for the accident; to avoid facing what he believes he has done, Michael and Kristina run away to Mexico. Claudia then enlists sociopath, Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roché) and orders him to track them down and kill them; instead Jerry uses the teens to lure Jason into a trap. Fortunately, Michael realizes that Jerry is holding them prisoner; Michael is very much like Sonny when it comes to recognizing a threat. Kristina doesn't want to believe Jerry is going to hurt them, but because the siblings were brought up differently, they see the situation differently. Michael and Kristina's attempt to live independently and start new lives in Mexico is cut short and they are forced back to Port Charles. However, the adventure leads to Michael's first kiss with a local girl, Marita.
By this time, Brown had started speaking out against the direction of her storyline, and her disapproving of Claudia intentionally trying to hurt Michael or Kristina. The complaints were followed by the announcement of Brown's departure in September 2009 with her onscreen exit slated for October. Most fans assumed that once the truth about Claudia's involvement in Michael's shooting was revealed, she would end up dead. An article from "The Huffington Post" called for just that. Due to Brown's exit coinciding with November Sweeps, it was expected that Brown's exit would have a major impact on the storyline. According to a spokesperson for the series, her exit would be "buzz-worthy."
Spoilers also began surfacing with reports that Claudia would be killed off. On the October 1, 2009 episode, Michael confronts Claudia about his memory of her confession; however, she is able to explain her way out of it. Despite the obvious, Michael defends Claudia to everyone that bad-mouths her. But, because Michael is not exactly sure if his memories are accurate, he hesitates to come forward. Michael goes so far as to warn Johnny that Jason and Sonny will soon learn the truth, telling Johnny that he may be the only person who can save Claudia. On October 30, 2009, Regan Cellura of "Daytime Confidential" posted a spoiler article confirming that Claudia was indeed going to die. On the night of Claudia's birthday party, Jason comes to Sonny with confirmation that Claudia hired the shooter that tried to kill him. Most fans had previously assumed that Sonny would be the one to "eliminate" Claudia, but in a shocking twist, it is Michael who finally kills Claudia. After Sonny outs Claudia at the party, she takes a laboring Carly hostage at gunpoint. The women end up at an abandoned cabin in the woods where a crazed Claudia, still grieving over her own miscarriage, plans to take Carly's newborn daughter Josslyn for herself. On the November 4, 2009 episode, as Claudia is about to run away with baby Josslyn, Michael comes upon Claudia's car and goes searching. He finds the cabin, and hearing his mother's screams, Michael grabs the first thing he sees — an axe handle — and swings it, bludgeoning Claudia to death.
Cover-up and prison (2009–10).
After the murder, Michael makes a "startling" change in behavior by not showing any emotional reaction, believing Claudia deserved what she got, and justifying his actions to save his mother and sister. However, Michael only feels guilty because he did not come forward about his flashbacks sooner and knows he could have prevented the situation. When it comes to Claudia, "Michael is in a very dark place," said Garrett to "Soap Opera Digest". The reckless behavior is Michael's attempt to live up to the Corinthos reputation, even going so far as to sic Sonny's goons on Kristina's jerk boyfriend, Kiefer Bauer (Christian Alexander). Despite Sonny's disapproval, Michael is more than determined to join Sonny's organization. Michael feels invincible believing he got away with what he did because of who his father is. Most of Michael's decisions are a source of conflict for his parents. Michael constantly insinuates himself into Sonny's business, despite Carly and Jason's disapproval. Sonny disapproves too, but believes keeping Michael close will protect him. Weeks prior to his 18th birthday, Michael warns his parental figures that he will start making decisions for himself. From the moment Michael realizes that Sonny might be convicted, Michael returns home with the evidence (his bloody shirt) in hand. However, Dante does not believe Michael's claims of guilt until after a forensics exam confirms them. According to Duell, Michael is in turmoil because no one wants him to confess. Dante tells Michael that if he comes forward, the judge will give him a lighter sentence. Duell stated: " thinks I need to get it off my chest. Of course he wants Sonny in prison, but he doesn't want me to hold this burden on myself. He wants me to get it out of my system." Dante relays Michael's story to the entire courtroom moments before the verdict for Sonny is delivered. When asked about Michael's future following the murder confession, Duell said, "A different life. He's going to go through a big change. He's going to have a much different lifestyle."
Michael is sentenced to 10 years in prison and forced to go in alone. Some of the prisoners give him trouble because he is Sonny's son, but one man named Carter (Josh Wingate) protects him. However, on May 21, Carter warns Michael and decides that he must repay him for protecting him. Michael fights him off, but Carter returns that night and tells Michael to "pay up" as he corners him. In the next episode, Jason discovers a nearly catatonic Michael and realizes something is wrong. Jason tries to help him cope without actually acknowledging what he believes happened. Michael is in denial when Jason finally questions him about the incident and he blames himself for "everything," by rehashing Claudia's murder. Hints are dropped, but Michael never confirms anything. Joe Diliberto of "Soap Opera Digest" acknowledged that the storyline, which started out pretty straightforward, started to become very vague. Duell admitted that "As the actor playing him, I play it a certain way; how I feel played out, so it's still a mystery." Before any confirmation, Guza said the "focus right now is on the horrific experience of an 18- or 19-year-old who is thrown into a terrible situation like this." He didn't want to make the story so specific so soon, but said the story could go in that direction. Michael has to deal at some point, but because of who Michael is, and who his father is, it is expected that he would get unwanted attention and attacks. Guza also revealed that Michael would get out of prison relatively quickly, but whatever happened to him would "fester." It is later revealed that Jason's rival, the crazed artist Franco (James Franco) sent Carter after Michael in prison. Though by this time, nothing has been confirmed, Jason believes Michael was raped. In an interview with "On-Air On-Soaps", Duell said the writers allowed him to play with the scenes (Michael in the cell after the confrontation with Carter) as he felt they played out, and would make a decision based on his portrayal. However, precaution is taken and Michael gets tested for HIV in addition to getting treated for his bruises. It is obvious Michael has been involved in a physical altercation of some sort, but the writers continue dancing around the subject. Chad Duell explained that it was difficult not to reveal too much during interviews and said that Michael would do the same; "He would not want to reveal too much." Duell explained that if Michael was raped, it would be hard for him to just come out and say it. It would be equally hard for everyone in his life to find out about the situation, and it would be really difficult for Michael to come to terms with it. Duell believed that if Michael had been raped, he would be a lot more distant and shut himself off. Despite there being no actual confirmation at the time of the storyline, fans and critics made the assumption that Michael had been sexually assaulted. "XFINITY's" Sara Bibel highlighted the soap's pattern of putting their teenage characters in peril. According to Bibel, "What was a vague allusion of something that could happen… became an overt possibility" within a week of Michael's stint in prison. In response to Michael's reactions when being touched, Bibel concluded, "In real life, getting punched in the face by a convict who claims to be offering protection would be traumatic enough to elicit [that reaction from an 18-year-old who is new to prison life. But this is a soap. Anyone who flinches when being touched, has in all probability been sexually assaulted." When Michael finally does get released from prison, he is on probation, and he cannot really enjoy his freedom because Jason, who got himself arrested to protect Michael, is still in jail. However, what makes matters worse for Michael is that he cannot have contact with Sonny; Michael is left without either father figure that raised him, so he feels alone and isolated. To top it all off, Michael has to live with Dante.
Romance with Abby and the rape (2010–11).
In July 2010, Chad Duell confirmed that show was developing a love interest for Michael and actresses would soon begin auditioning for the role. Duell explained that there would always be drama in any relationship Michael had with a girl because of what happened to him; "it will be difficult for him to be physical with a girl, or even be affectionate with a woman," Duell stated. Like any other aspect of Michael's life, intimacy of any kind becomes a struggle. Michael is forced to confront his intimacy issues when Kristina's friend Ali (Maitland McConnell) takes an interest in him. When Ali invites him to a party, he goes to his aunt, Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) and confides in her that he insecure about possibly getting intimate with Ali because he does not have any sexual experience. Sam enlists her stripper friend, Candy (Andrea Bogart) to help Michael deal with his intimacy issues. When the two are about to have sex for the first time in October 2010, Michael gets cold feet and gets a little aggressive with Candy when he believes things are moving too fast. Candy backs off and advises Michael that getting to know Ali would be his best option. In the meantime, Michael takes a liking to Candy and wants to get to know her. He learns that her real name is actually Abigail "Abby" Haver and that she only got into stripping so she could pay for her schooling. According to Duell, Michael finds it easy to talk to Abby because she doesn't know him; they can start with a clean slate. During an interview with "Soap Opera Weekly", Duell revealed "She doesn't know about his baggage; what's happened to him in the past. She knows nothing about his family." Michael and Abby are able to start off fresh and build their relationship based on them getting to know one another. Michael does not have anyone his age who gives him that sense of "anonymity," because all of his classmates are aware of his past struggles. A friendship with someone as mature as Abby is just the kind of relationship Michael needs to help him deal with his own issues. Despite Michael really enjoying Abby's company, it would take a while before she gets him to open up and talk about what happened to him in prison. Duell admitted that Michael might never want to acknowledge what happened to him prison, unless he reaches his "breaking point." Michael finally reaches that point in January 2011 when he comes clean about his experience in prison. Viewers had suspected for months that Michael was raped and on January 31, 2011, Michael confirms those suspicions. Michael must relive the horrific experience of his rape at the hands of Carter when he witnesses Abby's ex-boyfriend, Brandon Lowell (Ross Thomas)'s attempted rape on her. Though the scenes are not very revealing, then head-writer, Bob Guza, wanted to make sure viewers noticed the visual and physical similarities between the attempted rape on Abby, and Michael's actual rape in prison. Michael's saving of Abby before she is actually raped serves as a kind of "catharsis" for him, allowing him to finally admit his experience in prison. "We needed a catalyst," Guza said during an interview with "TV Guide" and Abby filled that role.
Each reaction to Michael's confession is very different; With Sonny, "Michael somehow feels like he's let his father down," but in his own way, Sonny also has the "right" reaction to Michael's confession. Carly's reaction is also very out of character, instead of allowing her anger to get the best of her, she embraces Michael. She even convinces him to go to counseling. However, when it comes to the confession, it appears that Jason is the most affected by it. "Jason has always been Michael's mentor," Guza explained, but is Jason's lifestyle that is directly responsible for Michael landing in prison, and by extension, the rape. The "guilt-stricken" Jason makes sure to remind Michael that "he's a survivor, not a victim." Once Michael has faced his past, he is able to open up to Abby and they make love for the first time on March 28, 2011.
Even with his new sense of freedom, and his new love, Michael is still determined to break into the mob. Upon his release, Michael "swore to himself he would never let anyone make him feel small and helpless as Carter (Josh Wingate) did to him and there's a part of him that wants to have the power now after feeling completely powerless," Duell revealed. Michael feels as if something was stolen from him in prison, so he wants to use the mob to fill that void. Despite understanding Michael's reasons for wanting to be in the mob, Duell described the obsession as "silly," because Michael is willing to throw his life away, despite all the support and opportunities he has. Fortunately, Abby is able to distract him from those desires and convinces him to work at ELQ with her instead.
However, Michael and Abby's age difference becomes a big problem for his mother, and his little sister, Kristina. Duell said that Michael and Abby "common ground with each other. Michael went through something really awful and she has been through abusive stuff." In addition, Michael and Abby do indeed love one another. Michael Fairman worried that because of Duell's performances whenever Michael is faced with tough situations, Michael would eventually lose Abby. Duell responded saying he'd have no problem playing a scenario in which Michael loses Abby, if it made sense, and was well written; however, he was content with and enjoyed building Michael's relationship with Abby. Fairman's words may have been prophetic because Andrea Bogart officially departed from the series several months later on December 13, 2011 when Abby is killed in a construction accident, leaving Michael devastated. Bogart stated that she hoped that Michael would eventually find some happiness because he had been through so much.
Romance with Starr and A.J.'s return (2012–13).
Upon Alderson's introduction as Starr, viewers and critics immediately began speculating that the two would be paired together. Duell said that he really enjoyed working with Alderson and said that he was ready for Michael to find some happiness. Michael and Starr's relationship starts off complicated because Sonny is believed to behind the deaths of her family. However, they immediately relate to one another because they are both grieving the loss of people they love. According to when Starr and Michael first start to bond, it is like one big "therapy session." Michael has to get Starr to trust him which is complicated by the fact that he could not save her family, and his father is the prime suspect in her family's murders. Michael defending Sonny causes a lot of trouble for the duo. Duell revealed that even if Michael and Starr were to become romantic, it would take quite some time as both of them needed to heal first. Even when Starr begins lashing out at Sonny, Michael understands that she has to blame someone. Talking with Starr starts the healing process for Michael. The two become friends rather quickly despite their father's being at odds. However, Duell revealed that a romance was possible once they could get past what has happened. But Duell hoped that it would not be rushed. According to Duell, helping Starr, could eventually help Michael come to terms with his own loss. And by the summer of 2012, Michael and Starr have admitted their feelings for one another and began dating. However, their new friendship and budding romance is threatened with re-introduction of Michael's sister, Kristina (Lindsey Morgan) and the arrival of her reality show producer, Trey Mitchell (Erik Valdez). Trey seems to annoy Starr a lot, which causes Michael to become a bit more protective of her. However, when Starr and Trey begin to commiserate over their fathers, Starr feels as if Michael is overreacting. Nothing ever comes of Trey's advances, as Michael and Starr grow closer as she supports him through the return of his biological father, and the death of his uncle.
The re-introduction of Michael's biological father, A.J. (Sean Kanan) completely turns his life upside down. Michael grows up believing the bitter battle was started by A.J. However, when A.J. tells him otherwise, Michael initially refuses to believe A.J.'s claims of being drugged in an alley by Carly, or left hanging on a meat hook by Sonny until he confronts his mother and she confirms A.J.'s stories. Michael is completely blindsided and disgusted by his mother's past actions. He never expected any of what A.J. told him to be true. Though he does not condone A.J.'s own actions – like kidnapping Michael and faking his death – Michael reminds Carly that A.J. only tried to defend himself in the war she started. Michael is full of mixed emotions; he does not know what to feel. Michael has so many questions running through his head, and majority of them begin with "What if?" Michael is completely torn on what to do. Is A.J. capable of change or telling the truth; would giving A.J. a chance hurt his relationships with Carly and Sonny.

Michael is rendered comatose in April 2008 after being shot in the head when a sniper tries to kill Sonny after the Metro Court Hotel hostage crisis that occurred by Michael's evil uncle and Sonny's enemy Jerry Jacks (Sebastian Roché) because Michael was a kid back then when that event claimed the life of his grandfather Alan Quartermaine (Stuart Damon) and Michael was told by authorities not to go inside because Sonny and Monica could end up losing Michael as well.
2009–11.
After the risky surgery, Michael wakes up exhibiting uncontrollable fits of rage. Carly, who is dealing with a high-risk pregnancy, agrees to send Michael to live with the Quartermaines.

The teens soon return, and Michael suddenly begins uncovering memories from the coma. He also discovers that he has potential for psychic dreams, and consults a psychic for help on both issues. His abilities later fade as a plot point due to emotional traumas Michael would soon face. Michael is on his way out of town when he discovers Claudia's car abandoned on the side of the road. Trying to stop Claudia from stealing a newborn Josslyn, Michael kills her and is forced to keep quiet. When Sonny is arrested for Claudia's murder, Michael's attempt to confess goes unnoticed and he is soon sent to Sonny's island. However, Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) finds Michael and brings him back to Port Charles where he confesses under oath to Claudia's murder. Michael is sent to prison, but Jason later pleads guilty to a felony and ends up sharing a cell with Michael because his cousin Molly Lansing-Davis (Haley Pullos) did it because his cousin was responsible for framing him according to Molly's mother and Michael's aunt Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn). Dante manages to work out a deal getting Michael released on parole. To get some "experience" before going out with Kristina's best friend, Ali (Maitland McConnell), Michael begins seeing Abby (Andrea Bogart).

Meanwhile, Kristina (Lindsey Morgan) returns causing trouble with her new reality-show producer Trey Mitchell (Erik Valdez). As the family mourns the deaths of Jason and Edward (John Ingle), Michael is embroiled in another battle pitting Sonny and Carly against a newly returned A.J. (Sean Kanan) when Carly reluctantly gives him access to his shares after Cesar Faison (Anders Hove) became enemies with his grandmother Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson). Together, they remove Tracy as CEO allowing A.J. to take her place. Michael eventually admits his love for Starr and he comforts her when Trey dies. His happiness is short-lived due to Starr's departure and their subsequent breakup. Michael gets drunk and mistakenly believes he slept with Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil) though Brenda admits she lied. Michael is forced to take in Morgan (Bryan Craig) and his scheming girlfriend, Kiki Jerome (Kristen Alderson).

A few days later, during Morgan and Kiki's wedding reception, it is revealed publically by Sonny that Morgan knew that Michael and Kiki weren't cousins before he married her.

After finding out about Morgan's lie, Kiki decided to end their marriage, causing Morgan to become upset and storm off, leaving Michael and Kiki alone. The two finally discuss their feelings and decide to give their relationship a chance, ready to face whatever challenges they face together.
Michael and Kiki decide to get jobs since they have no money so Kiki goes to her biological father Silas Clay (Michael Easton) to ask for a job at the hospital, and Michael goes to Sonny for a job in the coffee importing business.

After Heather was arrested by Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) and Nathan West (Ryan Paevey) arrived on foot he and Morgan knew Carly was okay, even his father Sonny couldn't figure out who kidnapped her.

Reception.
General.
In 2003, Cash won the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in TV Series for his portrayal of Michael. In response to Michael's fits of rage after the coma, Michael Fairman wondered, "Did something go wrong with Patrick’s miracle surgery or is it just a case of scrambled brain cells that will eventually heal and allow the real Michael to emerge?" Fairman goes on to describe Garrett as being very impressive, from the start and proving why he was the man to play "one of the most important and sought after roles in daytime." Fairman raves about Garrett's performance saying he took viewers on an emotional journey. Fairman also discussed the irony of Jason becoming the only person Michael can really depend on, considering Jason raising Michael for the first year of his life. Mallory Harlen said Garrett's Michael was extremely compelling and said Garrett "skillfully navigates the character's drastic mood swings." Despite his controversial firing, Garrett received a Daytime Emmy nomination in the Outstanding Younger Actor category for his portrayal of Michael following Claudia's murder. Carolyn Hinsey said it was ironic that Drew Garrett was nominated after he was fired. When Duell's Michael is sent to prison, Carly threatens to do anything to get him out and Michael replies, "No prison breaks, okay? Your plans always make me nervous." "Soap Opera Digest" listed their exchange as one of the show's funniest lines. Chad Duell ranked at #5 on "Daytime Confidential's" list of the "Top 10 Soap Newcomers of 2010." The list described Duell's first few weeks as "shaky" but applauded him for settling into the role. The article also noted Duell's expert portrayal of Michael during the prison storyline stating that the actor "managed to expertly convey the sorrow, anger, confusion and angst of a privileged young man who had to pay for the lifestyle his parents raised him up in." Nelson Branco of "TV Guide" also listed Duell on his list of "2010's Hottest Newcomers." Also in 2011, Duell won "TV Guide's" Soap Opera Spirit award for Outstanding Male Actor in a New Role or Recast. Michael Logan of "TV Guide" acknowledged that Duell's overall portrayal of Michael throughout 2010 was very good, but his submission for the Emmy was not his absolute best. Duell was listed as the Performer of the Week in January 17, 2012 issue of "Soap Opera Digest" and applauded Duell for his portrayal of Michael grieving for Abby. The scene in which Michael says goodbye to Abby comes off "signaling that whatever innocence Michael had left died alongside Abby."
Michael's shooting.
Fans and critics alike criticized the rumored storyline. Jamey Giddens, of "Daytime Confidential" wondered what Cash's exit would mean for the "already fractured dynasty." "Daytime Confidential's" Tina disapproved of the story due to Michael's involvement in Kate's shooting in February of that same year. Another member of "Daytime Confidential", Luke Kerr also spoke out against the storyline due to Michael being one of the only surviving members of the famed Quartermaine family, despite being raised as a member of the Corinthos family. However, Kerr expressed his hope that the character would be aged and also recommended "As the World Turn's" Jesse Lee Soffer (Will Munson) for the role. Viewers are shocked and dismayed on April 4, 2008, when the 12 year old Michael gets shot in the head, and falls into a coma. While some viewed the shooting of a child as a "risky move," others saw the plot as an opportunity for the character to be aged.
Recast.
Drew Garrett's sudden ousting was characterized by most critics as "shocking." "Soaps In Depth" confirmed the report on Twitter. The show was criticized for recasting the role at the height of a very critical storyline in the character's history. Garrett's costar Steve Burton responded to the news on Twitter saying, "Sucks!Sucks!Sucks!" Allison Waldmen of "The Huffington Post" stated, "It's hard to fathom why 'GH' has made this switch," explaining that Garrett was very good in his portrayal of Michael, and that he fit nicely with his costars. On the day of the announcement, "Keep Drew Garrett" became a trending topic on Twitter. Along with fan outrage, the news sparked a Facebook campaign with constant comments from Garrett's fans. Founder of the campaign, LeAnn Skeen responded to criticism about her efforts with, "It's not silly. Fans get really upset about TV shows. And the executive producers really need to respect what the viewers want." Garrett responded to the firing with the following statement: "Whether I stayed on the show one year or four years or two years, it was a great experience regardless and a great tool for my career." Garrett's mother, Karole Cooney, admitted that she had never watched soaps before, but started watching because of her son, and had actually come to enjoy "General Hospital" apart from her son's portrayal. With the news of his firing, Cooney admitted that she was very conflicted about continuing to watch the series. Fans also reacted by creating a YouTube video montage of Garrett's time on "GH" titled, "Keep Drew Garrett." Garrett's costar, Maurice Benard voice his displeasure about Garrett's firing in an issue of "Soaps In Depth" but acknowledged that he would have no problem continuing with the story, and remarked that, "Sometimes, you have to put personal feelings aside." Duell later revealed in an interview that due to Benard still being upset about Garrett's firing, he put some distance between them. Later, Benard and Duell found some common ground and have since developed a friendship. Garrett later told "Soaps In Depth" that the reaction to his ousting gave him some closure and said it "was a really great run." Though he maintained contact with some costars, he does not watch the show. Duell said he expected to land a soap gig because he had auditioned for others but he was a bit shocked by the decision to recast. Though Michael can be seen as an infuriating teenager, Becca Thomas described Garrett's performance as "stellar" said that she actually rooted for Michael despite all the terrible decisions he made. "Garrett was a fantastic Michael" said Thomas. The younger characters had become very well rounded, and Garrett's ousting leaves viewers unsure about the direction. "Soap Opera Digest" described Morgan being recast so soon after Michael as "March Madness." Laura Wright said though Duell's portrayal of Michael is "100% different" but still good. Though she was close to Drew Garrett, she could not take it out on Chad because the decision was beyond his control. The news of Garrett's departure was one the genre's biggest headlines during the year of 2010. In a review, Becca Thomas and Mallory Harlen said they were disappointed in Garrett's ousting considering his portrayal was one of the big reasons for them to watch. However, the article applauded Duell who proved that "lightning does strike twice." Duell was categorized as the Best Newcomer of the year. Thomas and Harlen praised Duell's performance during Michael's prison stint and possible rape.
Rape storyline.
Though the potential storyline garnered the attention of many, some questioned if the show went too far in the storyline. Due to the rarity of television shows dealing with the reality of prison rape, critics wondered if the story was being used progressively or just to garner ratings. A majority of fans believed that the story was much too dark. During an interview with then scriptwriter, Karen Harris, Lori Wilson of "Soaps She Knows" applauded Duell for his "fantastic" work. Harris herself acknowledged that it was very risky, but "brilliant" to put Sonny's son in that position and applauded Guza for his bravery in going in that direction. Daniel Villarreal of the online magazine "Queerty" commented, "Showing [the rape's effects on the young man makes for a more heartrending tale than if they’d just shown the attack." Other soap operas, "All My Children", "The Young and the Restless", and "One Life to Live" all featured storylines alluding to prison rape in the 1980s, but "GH" is the first of the genre to actually address the reality in full. "TV Guide's" Michael Logan compares the storyline to HBO television series, Oz believing that the show would show the full experience. Logan also noted that the storyline became very vague, as if the writers were struggling with whether to continue with the plot because of fan outrage when it was only implied that Michael may have been raped. Chrissie Ortiz of "TVSource" noted that Michael's confession scenes "struck an emotional chord" allowing for the actors to deliver "heart-wrenching" performances. Ortiz labeled Duell's performance as "brilliant" and applauded scriptwriters, Karen Harris and Michele Val Jean for their "amazing writing". Michael Fairman awarded Duell, as well as his costars with the Power Performance of the Week in February 2011 for Michael's confession scenes. Fairman called Duell's performance "riveting." Ortiz said that Duell's performance during Michael's confession made up for the shocking recast because he was able to take a very complex role and make it his own. Duell's performance pulled you into the scene and Ortiz described it as being "full of such raw emotion." However, Ortiz criticized the promo for the following week in which the narrators asked the question, "Can Sonny help his son heal?" Ortiz disapproved of the story becoming about other characters; Ortiz then stated the question should've been, "How will Michael heal?" Duell was listed as the Performer of the Week for in March 8, 2011 issue of Soaps Opera Digest for the scenes in which Michael confesses to being raped. Soap Opera Digest said, "And with his heartfelt, poignant, portrayal, Duell has finally and firmly made this role his own."

History.
The settlement of the region dates back to, at least, the Roman occupation of the Iberian Peninsula (at one time confused with the village of Carteia). There are still other authors who suggest that settlement of the region may have remoted to the period of Phoenician or Carthaginian traders.
For several centuries, Quarteira was a modest fishing village, situated on the edge of a beach, encircled by pines. King Denis authorized a foral ("charter") for the settlement on 15 November 1297.
In the 15th century, King John I of Portugal ordered the first cultivation of sugar cane in continental Portugal.
Created in 1916, the civil parish quickly became known for its beaches, fishing and its forests of pine.

Sissy Frenchfry

Sissy Frenchfry is a 2005 gay short film directed by J.C. Oliva. It is a high school political fable that explores what happens when personal freedoms are sacrificed to promote a culture focused on winning games, financial success, and power.
Plot.
Welcome to wildly eclectic and diverse West Beach High, where the annual Student Body President election will pit the quirky, much-beloved incumbent Sissy Frenchfry against a handsome, charismatic – and socially intolerant – transfer student with a devious plan to restore the "status quo."
Sissy Frenchfry is the most popular student at West Beach High. He’s got bleached blond hair with pink tips, earrings, and a decidedly unique fashion sense. The eternally good-natured Sissy is Student Body President, a member of every club on campus, and head of the yearbook and newspaper. Sissy IS the big man on campus, until one day…
A transfer student named Bodey McDodey arrives at West Beach. Bodey is the quintessential All-American jock: handsome, arrogant, charming, and accomplished. He’s ready to assume command as Alpha male in what should be a familiar high school setting; however, he’s astounded at what he finds at West Beach. QB & Ross, the school’s quarterback and linebacker, are boyfriends and openly affectionate; the talented yet plump Georgia Peach holds the head cheerleader position despite not being a size 2; and the school’s student videographer and Sissy’s best friend, Dana Aquino, is a goth transgender student. “What is wrong with this school?” Bodey asks himself. The worst of all is the fact that Sissy Frenchfry, someone Bodey considers a loser and a nuisance, holds the position of ultimate authority and respect in the school: Student Body President. Bodey sets his sights on the presidency, aiming to change West Beach forever.
What follows is Bodey bribing, seducing, and manipulating his way into a position of popularity and power. Sissy must choose between his integrity, his duty to maintain the peace of the school, and his own desire to win the election.
Will Sissy win back the school?
A Feature-length version of this award winning short-film is in development. In addition, there is a limited-edition line of Sissy Frenchfry products available thru Cafepress.com with proceeds going toward the feature production.

<doc id="5885549" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5885549" title="Tubifex">
Tubifex

Tubifex is a cosmopolitan genus of tubificid annelids that inhabit the sediments of lakes, rivers and occasionally sewer lines. At least 13 species of "Tubifex" have been identified, with the exact number not certain, as the species are not easily distinguishable from each other.
Reproduction.
"Tubifex" worms are hermaphroditic: each individual has both male (testes) and female (ovaries) organs in the same animals. These minute reproductive organs are attached to the ventral side of the body wall in the celomic cavity. In mature specimens, the reproductive organs are clearly found on the ventral side of the body. 
Copulation and cocoon formation.
Although the "Tubifex" worms are hermaphrodites, the male and female organs become mature at different times; thus self-fertilization is avoided, and cross-fertilization is encouraged. Two mature "Tubifex" worms undergo copulation by joining their ventral and anterior surfaces together with their anterior ends pointing opposite directions. Thus, the spermathecal openings of each worm is nearer to the male apertures of another worm. The penial setae of one worm penetrate into the tissues of other worm and thus the conjugants are held together. At this stage, the sperm of one worm is passed into the spermathecae of the other worm. 
After copulation, they separate and begin to produce egg cases containing eggs, called cocoons. The cocoon is formed around the clitellum as a soft, box-like structure into which the ova and the sperm are deposited. Soon, the "Tubifex" worm withdraws its body from the egg case by its backward wriggling movements.
Culturing "Tubifex".
At least two species of "Tubifex" are raised commercially, mainly for fish food: the reddish "Tubifex tubifex" and a slightly larger, darker species, the "black worm". "Tubifex" can be easily cultured on mass scale in containers with 50- to 75-mm thick pond mud at the bottom, blended with decaying vegetable matter and masses of bran and bread. Continuous, mild water flow is to be maintained in the container, with a suitable drainage system. After the arrangement of the system, the container is inoculated with "Tubifex" worms which can be obtained from nearby muddy canals or sewage canals. Within 15 days, clusters of worms develop and can be removed with mud in masses. When worms come to the surface due to lack of oxygen, they are collected and washed under brisk stream of water to remove residual mud attached to their bodies. 
Live food.
"Tubifex" worms are often used as a live food for fish, especially tropical fish and certain other freshwater species. They have been a popular food for the aquarium trade almost since its inception, and gathering them from open sewers for this purpose was quite common until recently. Most are now commercially obtained from the effluent of fish hatcheries, or from professional worm farms.
Using these worms as a live food has come with certain problems over the years. When harvested from sewers, open bodies of water, and even from hatcheries, they may be infected with various diseases. This risk can be partially solved by keeping the worms under brisk running water until they have voided the contents of their digestive systems. However, the worms can still be vectors for whirling disease, which can affect salamanders and certain tropical fish. Additionally, they are very difficult for some fish to obtain in the wild, so certain fish, such as Rift Valley cichlids, will obsessively consume them until they make themselves sick. Additionally, while the worms have good-quality proteins, they also are very fattening, and are poor in certain important amino acids. Fish fed on them can grow rapidly, but may be less healthy and colorful than fish with more balanced diets. Lastly, in poorly cleaned aquaria, "Tubifex" can become established as a pest species, covering the bottom of the aquarium in a thick carpet which may be considered unsightly.
"Tubifex" species.
The genus includes the following species:

Adam Cost

Cost is the tag name of a graffiti writer who, from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, blanketed New York City and the surrounding metropolitan area with his wheatpaste stickers, spray paint tags and paint-roller pieces. Cost, whose real name is Adam Cole, is perhaps most widely known for his collaboration with another New York graffiti artist, Revs.
Graffiti career.
Cost and Revs became well known in the early 1990s, when, on any given block in Manhattan, a passerby could spot the duo’s wheat paste tags posted on the back of the Walk/Don't Walk street-crossing signal. On these wheat pasted papers, Cost and Revs printed in bold black ink intentionally obscure messages such as "Cost fucked Madonna" or "Suicide Revs". Later they collaborated on large, bold roller pieces on highly visible walls, subway embankments, and advertising hoardings.
When asked in 1993 by a New York Times Style reporter what it all meant, Cost said, "If you could give us and Revs the meaning of life, I’d give you the meaning of us." At that time the posters included a phone number; those who called heard a woman's recorded voice repeat their questions back to them: "My intuition tells me that you're asking yourselves who are Revs and Cost and what are they doing? What is it? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean?"
Cost and Revs continued to write in New York City with impunity, highly visible examples of the graffiti that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was determined to eradicate. One letter writer called Cost "probably the worst graffiti vandal in the history of New York."
Arrest.
In 1995, though, Cost’s luck finally ran out when police caught him tagging a mailbox. In court, the judge estimated that Cost had done over $100 million in damages but only fined him $2,126 and ordered him to do 200 days community service removing graffiti. That run-in with the law eventually led to Cost’s bowing out of the graffiti scene. Revs, however, has gone on to expand on his art and even operates in a legal arena, making headlines recently for creating public, steel sculptures.
Comeback.
Starting in 2010 Cost made a return to the streets, once again covering the city with wheatpastes alongside new partner ENX. In addition to his trademark blanketing of the city, this comeback also includes a popular Instagram account.

<doc id="5885561" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5885561" title="Yangsanjab">
Yangsanjab

Yangsanjab, Prince Öndür, was a Mongol prince of the Khorchin Left Wing Middle Banner in southeastern Mongolia. He was one of the leading figures in the resistance against Chinese colonization of Mongolia. Unlike Ghada Meyiren, he is rarely spotlighted, probably because he was from the ruling class and unfits for the Marxist framework of class struggle.
Background.
Yangsanjab was born to the hereditary house of Prince Öndür, which was placed second ("doroi giyūn wang") in Manchu-Mongol royal ranks. He belonged to the Borjigin clan and was a descendant of Hasar, Genghis Khan's younger brother. Hasar's descendant Jayisang contributed to the rise of Manchu Qing Dynasty (1636–1912) and intermarried with the Aisin Gioro imperial family. Jayisang's descendants ruled the Khorchin Left Wing Middle Banner (commonly called Darkhan Banner; now Khorchin Left Wing Middle Banner, Tongliao City, Inner Mongolia) of Jirim League. The jasagh, or the banner's head was occupied by Prince Darkhan, the descendants of Jayisang's last son. The house of Prince Öndür was one of other branch families founded by Jayisang's sons.
As Jirim League was close to China, it was subjected to an enormous population pressure from China. The Chinese immigrants came under the administration of Chinese prefectures, and the Mongol banner quickly shrunk. The banner became too small for the Mongols to keep nomadic pastoralism. From the 19th century on, they were forced to move northward or were settled into agricultural villages. In its final years, the Qing Dynasty promoted Chinese colonization of Mongolia to increase tax revenues and build a borderland defense. The Republic of China, which overturned the Qing Dynasty, boosted Chinese colonization. By the 1920s, the most part of Darkhan Banner was controlled by the Chinese.
Activity.
He succeeded his father Nayangerel as Prince Öndür as late as in 1920, but had gained popularity among the Mongols in the banner even before the succession. He stayed in Beijing for about six months a year, starting in 1915, and engaged in political activities to protect the rights of the Mongols. In addition, Prince Öndür became the sole mainstay among the Mongols, because by that time, the other powerful princely houses, Princes Darkhan and Jorightu, had left the banner for Mukden.
Yangsanjab was a disciple of the Janggiya Khutughtu, the highest-ranking lama in southern Mongolia. Using the Tibetan Buddhist connection, he got close to the 9th Panchen Lama. In 1926, Yangsanjab and Prince Darkhan invited the Panchen Lama to Darkhan Banner. The lama stayed in the banner for nearly a year beginning in 1927. He hosted the Lama's Ceremony, to which Mongol princes came from all over Mongolia, and succeeded in increasing his presence.
By the late 1920s, the most productive lands in Darkhan Banner had been cultivated by Chinese peasants, and the authorities of Liao-ning Province (renamed from Feng-tien in 1929) were about to launch cultivation projects, dividing the banner's last land into two areas, Hsi-chia-huang and Liao-pei-huang. Realizing that cultivation would push the Mongols in the banner onto the margin of survival, Yangsanjab and other princes and tayiji pressed the government of Liao-ning to stop the projects in 1930. He also worked on the 9th Panchen Lama, then in the banner, to place pressure on the Chinese province. However, Liao-ning Province made no concessions, and forcibly conducted the cultivation projects.
The failure of the negotiations led Yangsanjab to mobilize a private army consisting of hundreds of Mongols. Yangsanjab's army was originally organized by his father, Nayangerel, to defend the banner from bandits when the Qing Dynasty began to fall after the Xinhai Revolution led by Han Chinese. His army started anti-cultivation activities, including the obstruction of farm surveys. In response Liao-ning Province crushed the Mongol troops with its own provincial army. The warlord government ordered that Yangsanjab's troops be incorporated into the jasagh's (the ruler of the banner's) army. The province made Prince Darkhan take disciplinary action against Yangsanjab, possibly because direct punishment by the Chinese authority would further inflame Mongols' anti-Chinese sentiment.
In spite of intensifying resistance against it, the Chinese cultivation project proceeded. The project was halted, however, by the Mukden Incident in 1931, and the establishment of Manchukuo. Manchukuo took the "Mongolian land protection policy" and aborted all Chinese projects for colonization. The end of cultivation of Hsi-chia-huang and Liao-pei-huang saved Khorchin Left Wing Middle Banner from abolition.
Yangsanjab placed great hopes in Manchukuo's policy toward Mongol banners. He fully cooperated with Manchukuo, and became the first head of the Khorchin Left Wing Middle Banner, instead of Prince Darkhan, who exhibited an uncooperative attitude toward Manchukuo. Yangsanjab died in Hsinking in 1941.

<doc id="5885566" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5885566" title="Chutes Park">
Chutes Park

Chutes Park in Los Angeles, California began as a trolley park in 1887. It was a amusement park bounded by Grand Avenue on the west, Main Street on the east, Washington Boulevard on the north and 21st Street on the south. At various times it included rides, animal exhibits, a theater and a baseball park. In 1910 the park was sold to new owners (including Frederick Ingersoll) and reopened as Luna Park. The amusement park closed in 1914.
The name Chutes Park was also applied to the baseball park which opened around 1900 and was the original home of the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League.
History.
David V. Waldron bought about at Washington and Main and began to develop the property in 1887. It had previously been the site of a hotel. He also made a business arrangement to establish a horse-drawn rail line to connect to the city streetcar lines because the location was outside of the Los Angeles city limits. He began weekly variety shows in a small pavilion, brought in animals for display, and planted an orange grove. Unfortunately, the park was allowed to decline and by the late 1890s was seldom used. In 1899, however, the property was sold to new owners which created the Los Angeles County Improvement Co. They built a new theater, baseball park and brought in new rides.
The Rides.
The park featured such rides as a roller coaster, a chutes water slide that dropped riders in boats from a tower into a manmade lake, and a miniature railroad. The park's merry-go-round was electrically powered, as was the engine that pulled the boats back up from the lake to the tower.
In October 1903, the operators added a steel-framed figure-eight roller coaster.
Attractions.
The site also included, at various times, such exotic diversions as a seal pond, ostriches and the interestingly named House of Trouble and Cave of the Winds. By 1901, it also had a 4,000-seat theater and a baseball park that seated 10,000.
The Los Angeles County Improvement Co. added fishing pond, a small circus, hot-air balloon rides, the Catalina Marine Band and a small railroad that followed the outer perimeter of the park.
The baseball park.
By 1900, the baseball diamond was completed on the northern end of the park, with a team to play in the new California League. It would be the first team to be called the Los Angeles Angels. It was also home of the Vernon Tigers. Following games, a gate in the center field fence was opened and fans were allowed to enter the theme park.
Chutes Park was replaced by Washington Park in 1912, which had been built nearby Chutes Park, at Washington and Hill Streets. The Chutes / Washington area was abandoned entirely when the Angels moved to Wrigley Field at 42nd Street and Avalon Boulevard.

Bud Day

George Everett "Bud" Day (February 24, 1925 – July 27, 2013) was a United States Air Force colonel and pilot who served during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, including five years and seven months as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Day was a recipient of the Medal of Honor and the Air Force Cross. , he is the only person to be awarded both medals.
Day's actions from August 26, 1967, through March 14, 1973, were the last to earn a Medal of Honor prior to the end of U.S. involvement in the war on April 30, 1975 – though some honorees (e.g. Leslie H. Sabo, Jr., honored on May 16, 2012) were cited for their medals after Day's recognition on March 4, 1976.
Early life and education.
Day was born in Sioux City, Iowa, on February 24, 1925. In 1942, he dropped out of Central High School and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps (USMC).
After the war, Day attended Morningside College on the G.I. Bill, earning a Bachelor of Science degree, followed by law school at the University of South Dakota, receiving a Juris Doctor. Day passed the bar exam in 1949 and was admitted to the bar in South Dakota. In later life, Day was also awarded a Master of Arts degree from Saint Louis University, a Doctor of Humane Letters from Morningside, and a Doctor of Laws from Troy State University. Day was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1977.
Military career.
Enlisting in the USMC on December 10, 1942, Day served 30 months in the North Pacific during World War II as a member of a 5-inch gun battery with the 3rd Defense Battalion on Johnston Island, but he never saw combat. He was discharged (the first time) on November 24, 1945.
On December 11, 1946, Day joined the Army Reserve, serving until December 10, 1949. On May 17, 1950, Day received a direct commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Iowa Air National Guard. He was called to active duty on March 15, 1951 for Undergraduate Pilot Training in the U.S. Air Force. He was awarded his pilot wings at Webb AFB, Texas in September 1952, continuing through December 1952 in All-Weather Interceptor School and Gunnery School.
From February 1953 to August 1955 during the Korean War, Day served two tours as a fighter-bomber pilot, flying the Republic F-84 Thunderjet in the 559th Strategic Fighter Squadron. Promoted to captain, he decided to make the Air Force a career and was augmented into the Regular Air Force. He was assigned to the 55th Fighter Bomber Squadron. He then trained to fly the F-100 Super Sabre in 1957 while stationed at RAF Wethersfield in the United Kingdom through June 1959. It was during this time that he had to bail out of a jet fighter without a parachute, becoming the first person ever to live through such a feat.
Day was Assistant Professor of Aerospace Science at the Air Force ROTC detachment at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri, from June 1959 to August 1963.
Anticipating retirement in 1968 and now a major, Day volunteered for a tour in Vietnam and was assigned to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air Base in April 1967. At that time, he had more than 5,000 flying hours, with 4,500 of them in fighters. On June 25, 1967, with extensive previous service flying two tours in F-100s, Major Day was made the first commander of Detachment 1, 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 37th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Phu Cat Air Base. Under the project name ""Commando Sabre"", twin-seat USAF F-100Fs were evaluated as a Fast Forward Air Control ("Fast FAC") aircraft in high threat areas, given that F-4 Phantom II aircraft were in high demand for strike and Combat Air Patrol (CAP) roles. Using the call sign "Misty", the name of Day's favorite song, his detachment of four two-seat F-100Fs and 16 pilots became pioneer "Fast FACs" (Forward Air Controllers) over Laos and North Vietnam. All Misty FAC crews were volunteers with at least 100 combat missions in Vietnam and 1,000 minimum flight hours. Tours in Commando Sabre were temporary and normally limited to four months or about 50-60 missions.
Prisoner of war.
On August 26, 1967, Major Day was flying F-100F-15-NA, AF Serial No. 56-3954, call sign "Misty 01", on his 26th Fast FAC sortie, directing a flight of F-105 Thunderchiefs in an air strike against a surface-to-air missile (SAM) site north of Thon Cam Son and west of Dong Hoi, north of the DMZ in North Vietnam. Day was on his 65th mission into North Vietnam and acting as check pilot for Captain Corwin M. "Kipp" Kippenhan, who was upgrading to aircraft commander. 37 mm antiaircraft fire crippled the aircraft, forcing the crew to eject. In the ejection, Day's right arm was broken in three places when he struck the side of the cockpit, and he also received eye and back injuries.
Kippenhan was rescued by a USAF HH-3E, but Day was unable to contact the rescue helicopter by survival radio and was quickly captured by North Vietnamese local militia. On his fifth night, when he was still within 20 mi (32 km) of the DMZ, Day escaped from his initial captors despite his serious injuries. Although stripped of both his boots and flight suit, Day crossed the Demilitarized Zone back into South Vietnam. Within 2 mi (3 km) of the U.S. Marine firebase at Con Thien and after 12–15 days of evading, he was captured again, this time by a Viet Cong patrol that wounded him in the leg and hand with gunfire.
Taken back to his original camp, Day was tortured for escaping, breaking his right arm again. He then was moved to several prison camps near Hanoi, where he was periodically beaten, starved, and tortured. In December 1967, Day shared a cell with Navy Lieutenant Commander and future Senator and presidential candidate John McCain. Air Force Major Norris Overly nursed both back to health, and McCain later devised a makeshift splint of bamboo and rags that helped heal Day's seriously atrophied arm.
On March 14, 1973, Day was released after five years and seven months as a North Vietnamese prisoner. Within three days Day was reunited with his wife, Doris Sorensen Day, and four children at March Air Force Base, California. On March 4, 1976, President Gerald Ford awarded Day the Medal of Honor for his personal bravery while a captive in North Vietnam.
Day had been promoted to Colonel while a prisoner, and decided to remain in the Air Force in hopes of being promoted to Brigadier General. Although initially too weak to resume operational flying, he spent a year in physical rehabilitation and with 13 separate medical waivers, was returned to active flying status. He underwent conversion training to the F-4 Phantom II and was appointed vice commander of the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.
Day, in 2008, said of his imprisonment, "As awful as it sounds, no one could say we did not do well. ...a POW was a major issue in my life and one that I am extremely proud of. I was just living day to day. One bad cold and I would have been dead."
Retirement.
After being passed over for nomination to brigadier general, Day retired from active duty in 1977 to resume practicing law in Florida. At his retirement he had nearly 8,000 total flying hours, 4,900 in single engine jets, and had flown the F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, F-100 Super Sabre, F-101 Voodoo, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, F-106 Delta Dart, F-4 Phantom II, A-4 Skyhawk, A-7 Corsair II, CF-5 Tiger and F-15 Eagle jet fighters.
Following his retirement, Day wrote an autobiographical account of his experiences as a prisoner of war, "Return with Honor", followed by "Duty, Honor, Country", which updated his autobiography to include his post-Air Force years. Among other endeavors, in 1996 Day filed a class action lawsuit for breach of contract against the United States government on behalf of military retirees who were stripped of their military medical care benefits at age 65 and told to apply for Medicare. Although winning the case in the district court in 2001, the judgment against the U.S. was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 2002. The U.S. Congress later redressed this situation by establishing the "TRICARE For Life" (TFL) program, which restored TRICARE military medical benefits for career military retirees over the age of 65, making the retirees eligible for both programs with Medicare as the primary payer and TRICARE as the secondary payer.
Political activity and controversy.
Day was an active member of the Florida Republican Party, was involved in the 527 group Swift Vets and POWs for Truth, and campaigned with John McCain in 2000 and 2008. In the months leading up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Day appeared in television advertisements—along with other members of the 527 group Swift Vets and POWs for Truth—decrying John Kerry's anti-war activities following his military service during the Vietnam War and declaring him "unfit" for service and of a "dishonest" disposition for comments and actions made by Kerry after the Vietnam War, including his testimony before Congress in Washington, D.C. During a 2008 teleconference with reporters from the Miami Herald, Day made comments regarding John McCain's stance on the Iraq War, stating that "I don't intend to kneel, and I don't advocate to anybody that we kneel, and John doesn't advocate to anybody that we kneel." Also during this interview he sparked controversy by making a broad generalization about what some saw as an ideological divide between Islam and America: "the Muslims have said either we kneel, or they're going to kill us." In the same interview when questioned about the role of 527 organizations in contemporary American politics, particularly his work for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Day stated "the bottom line is this: 527 groups can do very effective, truthful things, and the Swift Boat attack was totally truthful."
Personal life and death.
Day lived in Shalimar, Florida. He had fourteen grandchildren and was a member of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod.
Day died on July 27, 2013 surrounded by family at his home in Shalimar. He was buried on August 1 at Barrancas National Cemetery at NAS Pensacola, Florida, U.S. (New Area, Sec. 51, Grave 30; ).
John McCain, Day's prisoner-of-war cellmate, said on Day's passing, "He was the bravest man I ever knew, and his fierce resistance and resolute leadership set the example for us in prison of how to return home with honor."
Honors.
A number of structures have been named after Day. On March 14, 1997, the new Survival School Building at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington, was named in his honor. In 2002, the Sioux City, Iowa, airport was renamed Sioux Gateway Airport/Colonel Bud Day Field. On May 7, 2010, Day Manor, a Visiting Officers Quarters (VOQ) at Goodfellow Air Force Base, Texas, was dedicated in his honor. A section of State Road 397 just outside of Eglin Air Force Base was named "Col. Bud Day Boulevard" on October 12, 2010.
On January 4, 2008, Day was awarded the Freedom Communications Spirit of Freedom Award on behalf of the Northwest Florida Daily News.
On March 15, 2014, he was named the Exemplar for the Class of 2017 at the United States Air Force Academy. Day was chosen for this honor due to his embracing of the Air Force Core Values; Integrity First, Service before Self, Excellence in all We do.

Citation: On 26 August 1967, Col. Day was forced to eject from his aircraft over North Vietnam when it was hit by ground fire. His right arm was broken in 3 places, and his left knee was badly sprained. He was immediately captured by hostile forces and taken to a prison camp where he was interrogated and severely tortured. After causing the guards to relax their vigilance, Col. Day escaped into the jungle and began the trek toward South Vietnam. Despite injuries inflicted by fragments of a bomb or rocket, he continued southward surviving only on a few berries and uncooked frogs. He successfully evaded enemy patrols and reached the Ben Hai River, where he encountered U.S. artillery barrages. With the aid of a bamboo log float, Col. Day swam across the river and entered the demilitarized zone. Due to delirium, he lost his sense of direction and wandered aimlessly for several days. After several unsuccessful attempts to signal U.S. aircraft, he was ambushed and recaptured by the Viet Cong, sustaining gunshot wounds to his left hand and thigh. He was returned to the prison from which he had escaped and later was moved to Hanoi after giving his captors false information to questions put before him. Physically, Col. Day was totally debilitated and unable to perform even the simplest task for himself. Despite his many injuries, he continued to offer maximum resistance. His personal bravery in the face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy. Col. Day's conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Armed Forces.
Air Force Cross citation.
The Air Force Cross is presented to George Everett Day, Colonel, United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force as a Prisoner of War in North Vietnam from 16 July 1969 to 14 October 1969. During this period, Colonel Day was subjected to maximum punishment and torture by Vietnamese guards to obtain a detailed confession of escape plans, policies, and orders of the American senior ranking officer in the camp, and the communications methods used by the Americans interned in the camp. Colonel Day withstood this punishment and gave nothing of value to the Vietnamese, although he sustained many injuries and open wounds to his body. Through his extraordinary heroism and willpower, in the face of the enemy, Colonel Day reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

Conselice

Conselice is a town and "comune" of about 10,000 people located in the Po River Valley, part of the province of Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, Italy.
Originally it was a Roman harbor (known in Latin as " Caput Silicis", literally "At the end of Via Silicis") important for the trade with Spina, an ancient Etruscan city, and located at the end of Via Sicilis, a Roman paved road intersecting the Via Emilia. The first written document mentioning the city as the "portus de capite selcis" dates to 1084. From 1395 to 1598 it was ruled by the House of Este, and subsequently was part of the Papal States until the unification of Italy in 1861.
Conselice is the birthplace of the poet and revolutionary Eleuterio Felice Foresti, later a professor at Columbia University and University of the City of New York (1842) and United States consulate general in Genoa (1856). Two local public schools are dedicated to him. The Italian partisan Ines Bedeschi, Gold Medal of Honor for Military Valor, and killed by the Nazis during the patriotic war 1943–45, was also born in Conselice in 1911
The local newspaper is a satiric one: "Caput Silicis".

31st Marine Expeditionary Unit

The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (31st MEU) is one of seven Marine Expeditionary Units in existence in the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Expeditionary Unit is a Marine Air Ground Task Force with a strength of about 2,200 personnel. The MEU consists of a command element, an infantry battalion with artillery, amphibious vehicle and other attachments, a composite helicopter squadron reinforced with a Harrier squadron and a combat logistics battalion. The 31st MEU is based at Camp Hansen, Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler, Okinawa, Japan. This is the only permanently forward-deployed MEU, and is America's expeditionary force-in-readiness in the Asia-Pacific region.
Mission.
The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit provides a forward deployed, flexible sea-based Marine Air Ground Task Force capable of conducting amphibious operations, crisis response and limited contingency operations in the Asia-Pacific area.
History.
Vietnam War.
The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit was activated on 1 March 1967 as Special Landing Force Alpha, for operations in Vietnam. It made the first of many amphibious deployments from Okinawa to the coast of Vietnam on 10 April 1967.
The first operation actually conducted was on 14 April 1967, when the MEU conducted a rescue of the crew of the SS Silver Peak, a Panamanian vessel run aground by Typhoon Violet, in vicinity of Minami Ko Shima Island, Japan.
Days later, it was committed to Operation Union, a search and destroy mission in Vietnam.
It was during this period of intense combat that Special Landing Force Alpha earned the Presidential Unit Citation. The unit participated in continuing combat operations ashore over the next three years, including the Vietnam Tet counteroffensive in 1969, while returning to Okinawa periodically for re-outfitting and the rotation of forces.
Special Landing Force Alpha was officially designated as the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) on 24 November 1970. Once more the unit returned to the Gulf of Tonkin. This time, however, the 31st MAU would not be committed to overt land operations as the Vietnam War was winding down. The 31st MAU performed presence missions and conducted a series of special operations through May 1971. From June 1971 until April 1975, the 31st MAU conducted many deployments to the waters off Vietnam.
The 31st MAU was then directed to the Gulf of Thailand for Operation Eagle Pull, the American Embassy evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which took place on 12 April 1975.
This was followed by the 31st MAU's participation in Operation Frequent Wind on 29 April 1975 which was the final evacuation of Saigon as North Vietnamese forces entered the city.
1980s and 1990s.
The 31st MAU remained the forward-deployed U.S. presence in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia. Combat operations were replaced by regional exercises, which allowed training opportunities in a variety of countries. 
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the 31st MAU engaged in humanitarian operations, for example the floods in Bangladesh (1984). In 1983, the 31st MAU was recalled from a combined exercise with local forces in Kenya, and positioned in the Mediterranean Sea. Its mission from September to October 1983 was to support U.S. peacekeeping forces in Beirut during an intense period of complex political and life-threatening conditions in Lebanon. They took over the command operations after their sister unit (22nd MAU) was attacked in the Beirut bombing. It was the 31st MAU's last military operation of that period and the unit was deactivated in May 1985 on ship off the shore of San Diego. During this time the 31st MAU was based at the Marine Barracks, Subic Bay Naval Station.
The unit was reactivated as the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) on 9 September 1992. In 1994, the unit was relocated to its current home station at Camp Hansen, in Okinawa, Japan.
Iraq 1998-99.
The flexibility of the MEU was demonstrated with the Iraq crisis in late 1998 regarding the regime not complying with the U.N. weapons inspections process. All four ARG ships had just completed Exercise Foal Eagle off the coast of Korea, and were heading to various port visits for liberty, when each ship received the call in early Nov 1998 to sail immediately to Okinawa to onload the 31st MEU.
A significant portion of the 31st MEU’s 2000 Marines were engaged in urban warfare training in Guam when their message to return to Okinawa came in November. The rest were still in Okinawa, but approximately a quarter of those were a new infantry battalion, just rotating in from California. The battalion had just two days to gather all their personnel to get ready to deploy.
The 31st MEU and ships’ company personnel started their initial onloads to the ships on 9 November and completed the morning of 11 Nov. In one night alone, they loaded more than 170 pallets of equipment, weapons, and cargo. In addition, a C-5 Galaxy from Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, originally scheduled to bring maintenance supplies and tools to Okinawa two weeks later, arrived early on 10 November 1998 in order to restock the MEU’s Air Combat Element. This evolution was a part of the normal supply rotation, but the shipment arrived a week early – just in time to load onto the ships before they departed.
From Nov 1998 to Feb 1999, the MEU participated in operations in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Kuwait, including Operation Southern Watch and Operation Desert Fox.
East Timor.
Marines of 31 MEU (SOC) deployed with Amphibious Squadron Eleven (PhibRon 11) to support Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations in East Timor in September 1999 until November of that same year. The The Air Combat Element (ACE) and portions of the Battalion Landing Team (BLT) supported East Timor operations and the ACE supported the ground operations of the ADF. The Marines and sailors were embarked aboard the Amphibious Assault Ship USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3) and conducted "lily pad" operations all around East Timor using the ship's large flight deck as a staging and refueling platform for Allied air operations in support of International Forces East Timor (INTERFET) commanded by the ADF contingent Commander of those operations Major General Cosgrove, Australian Army.
US Forces portions of the MEU, including Golf Company, 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines and Charlie Company 1st Battalion 5th Marines, then the MEU's Battalion Landing Team; portions of the Command Element; and HMM-265, the MEU's Air Combat Element; and MEU Service Support Group 31 deployed to East Timor in January 2000 aboard as Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force East Timor. In East Timor, the Marines and Sailors supported the transition from the Australian-led International Forces in East Timor (INTERFET) to the new United Nations Transitional Administration East Timor (UNTAET).
9-11.
On September 12, 2001, which was September 11 on the East Coast, the Marines of the 31st MEU's Battalion Landing Team 2nd Battalion 5th Marines (BLT 2/5) were secured in their barracks on Camp Hansen as a Super Typhoon was passing over Okinawa, Japan. Marines became aware of the September 11 attacks through the Armed Forces Network television and radio stations, and word quickly spread. That evening the 31st MEU received a 96-hour warning order for deployment and was notified that the Navy ships were en route to load as quickly as possible. Although the storm was still in progress, Marines prepared their personal gear, plans were made, and vehicles and equipment were quickly moved to the port facility and onto the ships. The helicopter squadron was the last to board due to the passing storm, and the on-load was successfully completed in 93 hours. The 31st MEU then steamed south towards their anticipated destination, Afghanistan. As the ships passed Singapore, their destination was changed to East Timor. There the MEU again supported UNTAET operations. It was later found out that the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, just returning from a deployment to East Timor, was assigned the task of heading to Afghanistan.
21st century.
From September 2004 to March 2005, the 31st MEU, including Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion 3rd Marines with attached Charlie Battery of 1st Battalion 12th Marines, conducted combat actions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Participation including a major role in Operation Phantom Fury, the clearing of Fallujah in November 2004.
With organizational changes to Marine Corps' reconnaissance units in 2006, all the MEU’s Special Operations Capable (SOC) designations were removed. The 31st MEU then became titled as a Maritime Contingency Force, although it remains capable of conducting the same wide variety of specialized missions on both sea and land.
In February 2006, the 31st MEU was sent to the Philippines to provide relief assistance during the mudslides in southern Leyte.
On 21 September 2007, the 31st MEU Command Element dedicated its headquarters building at Camp Hansen, Okinawa to Sergeant Rafael Peralta, who died in Iraq during Operation Phantom Fury while assigned to the 31st MEU. Sgt Peralta received the Navy Cross for his actions in Fallujah.
In May and June 2008, the MEU participated in Operation Caring Response after Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar.
In October 2009 the MEU assisted in humanitarian & disaster relief in Luzon, Philippines after Typhoons Ketsana and Parma hit back to back. Simultaneously, elements of the MEU assisted in Sumatra, Indonesia after earthquakes struck the region.
In October 2010, the 31st MEU conducted humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in northern Luzon after Super Typhoon Megi hit the Philippines.
Japan earthquake and tsunami.
The 31st MEU was split into three separate parts on March 11, 2011, the day of the 9.0 earthquake and tsunami. The largest ship, , with most of the Marines and Sailors of the 31st MEU aboard, had just completed an exercise in Cambodia and had arrived in Malaysia for a port visit. When 31st MEU leadership received news of the tsunami, they initiated an immediate recall of all personnel who were away from the ship on liberty. The ship quickly took on some supplies, and in less than 24 hours was underway to Japan where it would meet up with and .
Germantown and Harpers Ferry were both in Indonesia with elements of the 31st MEU embarked, and marines and sailors aboard the USS Harpers Ferry were scheduled to participate in a large humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise starting 12 March. Both ships were immediately alerted upon news of the disaster in Japan and headed north for the stricken country in support of what would become Operation Tomodachi.
The Essex Amphibious Ready Group and the 31st MEU first arrived off the coast of Akita, Japan, 17 March and began flying coastal surveillance flights in the initial stages of Operation Tomodachi. Then, on 22 March, the ARG repositioned off the east coast of Japan, near Hachinohe, and the 31st MEU immediately began delivering relief supplies ashore via helicopters of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 262 (Reinforced). Supplies delivered included water, blankets, and other health and comfort items. HMM-262 (REIN) conducted a total of 15 survey missions and 204 supply delivery missions with nearly 300 hours of flight time.
On 27 March, the MEU and Essex ARG’s priority became support to the isolated island of Oshima as part of Operation Tomodachi. Elements of the 31st MEU, including Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 262 (Reinforced), Combat Logistics Battalion 31, 2nd Battalion 5th Marines and the command element went ashore on Oshima Island to remove debris, deliver critical supplies to the isolated area, and provide life support.
Combat Logistics Battalion 31 began by transporting relief supplies, which included moving commercial electric utility vehicles, a fuel truck, a water re-supply vehicle and civilian workers from the Tohoku Power Company by U.S. Navy landing craft to attempt to restore partial power to the cut-off island. The same day the utility vehicles were delivered, the island received power for the first time since the disaster.
During the Oshima operation, pallets of clothes, blankets, and food were flown to the JMSDF helicopter destroyer JS Hyuga (DDH 181) by Marine helicopters, where they were distributed to displaced residents of the island who were temporarily embarked aboard the ship.
Working alongside the JGSDF, the 31st MEU delivered 15,000 pounds of supplies to the island and cleared tons of debris from harbors, roads and beaches. Marines also created temporary shower facilities allowing residents to bathe. For some it was the first time they had been able to take a shower since the tsunami struck.
In total, the 31st MEU and the Essex ARG moved 164,000 pounds of relief supplies to those affected by the disaster, including five cities, Oshima Island and the Japanese ship.
Typhoon Haiyan and Operation Damayan.
In November 2013, the 31st MEU acted as a contingency reserve in wake of Typhoon Haiyan in the Republic of the Philippines. The MEU was conducting unit turnover when they were tasked to respond and quickly embarked aboard the USS Ashland (LSD 48) and USS Germantown (LSD 42) of Amphibious Squadron 11 to assist in disaster relief operations in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State and Joint Task Force 505. The Aviation Combat Element of the 31st MEU, Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265, flew over 415 flight hours to deliver aid supplies throughout the region. The rest of the MEU remained at sea in the Leyete Gulf of the Philippines to act as a contingency reserve in the event any more assistance was needed or another disaster were to strike the area. 
South Korean ferry Sewol.
In April 2014, the 31st MEU on board the "USS Bonhomme Richard" assisted assisted in air-sea search and rescue operations of the Korean ferry "Sewol" that “sank near the island of Jindo off the southwestern coast of the Republic of Korea April 16”. 
Current operations.
The 31st MEU is the Marine Corps' only permanently forward-deployed MEU and remains the Marine Corps' force in readiness in the Asia-Pacific region. It conducts regularly scheduled semi-annual patrols throughout the region and participates in several multilateral training exercises with allied militaries. The 31st MEU remains ready for a wide range of contingency operations ranging from amphibious assault operations to humanitarian aid and disaster relief missions.
Unit awards.
A unit citation or commendation is an award bestowed upon an organization for the action cited. Members of the unit who participated in said actions are allowed to wear on their uniforms the awarded unit citation. The 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit has been presented with the following awards:

Health Dialog

Health Dialog is a care management, employee wellness, and decision support provider, and wholly owned subsidiary of Rite Aid Corporation. The company is based in the United States and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The company was founded in 1997 to address the unwarranted variation research done by Dr. John Wennberg and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. Dr. Wennberg's research found that the amount of healthcare services consumed per capita varies significantly between different regions of the United States, and that areas that deliver more care or higher-cost care do not necessarily show improvements in health quality outcomes. The company seeks to reduce unwarranted variation in the U.S. healthcare system through care management and shared decision making.
History: Dartmouth Atlas and Unwarranted Variation.
In 1967, Dr. John Wennberg began documenting geographic variation in healthcare. In 1988 he founded the Center for Evaluative Clinical Services (CECS) at Dartmouth Medical School. Wennberg's work has shown that that patients in regions of the United States that spend more and provide more healthcare services per capita often experience worse outcomes than lower-spending areas that provide less care. Through his research, Wennberg has argued that "the Medicare system could reduce spending by at least 30% while improving the medical care of the most severely ill Americans." For his contributions to the study of the healthcare system and health policy, Wennberg was named by "Health Affairs" as "the most influential health policy researcher of the past 25 years." 
Founded in 1997, Health Dialog collaborates with the non-profit Informed Medical Decisions Foundation to produce patient decision aids that seek to address unwarranted variation in healthcare and improve medical decisions through shared decision making.
Shared Decision Making.
Shared decision making is a process with the aim of increasing patients' understanding of their conditions and treatment options, as well as their involvement in the choices that decide their care. 82 percent of adults over the age of 40 have made a decision about having surgery, undergoing a screening test, or tasking a new medication in the past two years. 54 percent of these adults have faced two or more of these types of medical decisions. Roughly one-third of medical decisions are about surgeries, tests, treatments, and procedures that have two or more treatment options.
Peer-reviewed research.
On September 23, 2010, a randomized controlled trial study led by Dr. David Wennberg entitled ""A Randomized Trial of a Telephone Care-Management Strategy"" was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study followed 174,120 individuals over 12 months and compared the annual medical costs of those who received enhanced care management provided by Health Dialog to those who received "standard" care management services. The study found that the overall medical and pharmacy costs of those in the intervention (enhanced) group were $7.96 per member per month lower than the control group. The study reported that much of the savings were derived from a 10.1% reduction in hospital admissions among the intervention group.

Psychoneuroendocrinology

Psychoneuroendocrinology is the clinical study of hormone fluctuations and their relationship to human behavior. It may be viewed from the perspective of psychiatry, where in certain mood disorders, there are associated neuroendocrine or hormonal changes affecting the brain. It may also be viewed from the perspective of endocrinology, where certain endocrine disorders can be associated with psychiatric illness. Brain dysfunctions such as in the hypothalamus can affect the endocrine system, which in turn can result in psychiatric symptoms. This complex blend of psychiatry, neurology and endocrinology is needed to comprehensively understand and treat psychiatric illnesses (see neurobiological brain disorder).
Disorders.
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a mood disorder which occurs recurrently in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and remits within the first day or two after the onset of menstruation. Symptoms include depression, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, bloating, breast tenderness, cramping, and headaches. About 5-9% of women of child-bearing age meet the DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. In some women, end-of-cycle worsening actually represents "menstrual magnification" of an underlying mood disorder.
Premenstrual dysphoric disorder can be treated cyclically with hormonal oral contraceptives, or with antidepressants, which may be used continuously or only during the late luteal phase. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, have been found to be effective in the treatment of PMDD. Physical symptoms can be affected by the intake of caffeine, salt, alcohol, and nicotine, so the use of these substances should be monitored and potentially decreased. Sleep hygiene measures, exercise, relaxation therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy are all potentially effective non-medication strategies for milder symptoms.
Postpartum Depression (PPD).
Postpartum psychiatric disorders typically divided into three categories: (1) postpartum blues (2) postpartum depression and (3) postpartum psychosis. It may be useful to conceptualize these disorders as existing along a continuum, where postpartum blues is the mildest and postpartum psychosis the most severe form of postpartum psychiatric illness. 
Up to 85% of women experience postpartum blues during the first two weeks after delivery. Symptoms include tearfulness, mood lability, irritability, and anxiety. These symptoms typically peak between postpartum days 5-7, and remit spontaneously within two weeks postpartum, so active treatment is not required.
Postpartum depression refers to a major depressive episode occurring following childbirth. While women can become depressed at different points in time following childbirth, the "postpartum-onset" specifier in the DSM-IV-TR is applied for depression with onset in the first four weeks post-partum. The risk of postpartum depression is increased by depression during pregnancy, or a history of postpartum depression. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a 10-item questionnaire that may be used to identify women who have PPD. On this scale, a score of 12 or greater or an affirmative answer on question 10 (presence of suicidal thoughts) raise concern and indicate a need for more thorough evaluation.
Treatment of postpartum depression can include individual or group psychotherapy, medication, and supportive interventions. A combination of individual psychotherapy (particularly cognitive therapy) and medication has been shown to be effective. There are no standard guidelines regarding medication therapy. The potential risk of infant exposure to small amounts of antidepressants in breast milk is unclear, so in each individual woman the risk of not taking antidepressants must be balanced against the risk of either not breastfeeding or potentially exposing the infant with continued breastfeeding. There is some reassuring data on the safety of SSRI antidepressants, and infants nursed by mothers taking SSRIS typically receive low levels of medication exposure.
Postpartum Psychosis.
Postpartum psychosis is the most severe form of postpartum psychiatric illness. It is a rare event that occurs in approximately 1 to 2 per 1000 women after childbirth. Its presentation is often dramatic, with onset of symptoms as early as the first 48 to 72 hours after delivery. The majority of women with puerperal psychosis develop symptoms within the first two postpartum weeks.
Symptoms include mood lability, agitation, confusion, thought disorganization, hallucinations, and disturbed sleep. The risk of developing postpartum psychosis is increased by a history of bipolar disorder, previous episodes of postpartum psychosis, a family history of bipolar disorder, and the current pregnancy being a woman's first. Consequences of postpartum depression can be significant, including suicide, infant neglect, and infanticide, so women with this condition are generally hospitalized. Acute treatment includes the use of a mood stabilizer, and antipsychotic, and if necessary a benzodiazepine for agitation.

Guns Don't Kill People Rappers Do

"Guns Don't Kill People, Rappers Do" (commonly referred to as "GDKPRD") is a song by the British Rap act Goldie Lookin Chain from their Greatest Hits album. In August 2004, the song peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart. With the tagline "The gun is the tool, the mind is the weapon", in this track the band again satirised the American hip hop scene.
The video for the song features the band doing a mock police line-up and being chased on customised mobility scooters. The video is shot mostly in the town of Watford, England, featuring such local landmarks as the original 1970s concrete brutalist style shopping centre, the YMCA building and the spiral car park ramp visible from the ring road.
The song was parodied by Chris Moyles and his BBC Radio 1 team, under the name Mouldie Lookin Stain and called "Dogs Don't Kill People Wabbitz Do". This version topped the UK Official Download Chart.

Costa da Caparica

Costa da Caparica () is a Portuguese civil parish, located in the municipality of Almada along the western coast of the district of Sétubal. In 2001 its population included approximately 11,707 inhabitants, within a total area of 10.18 km². Since December 2004, the Costa da Caparica has been designated as city within the urban hierarchy of Portugal.
History.
The toponymy "Caparica" developed from a legend about an old woman who lived between Almada and the ocean, over cliffs of Sul do Tejo. The old woman, thin and frail, wore a multi-coloured patchwork cape to protect herself from the cold, and who pandered to the local people of the small hamlet in which she lived. Many assumed she was a witch and miser, who guarded a fortune, but who, nonetheless never missed mass (travelling long distances between mountains and valleys while huddling on the side-roads under her cape) and regularly panhandled in the streets. On day, after a long absence, the local villagers went to her humble cabana, where they discovered the body of the old woman within her cape and with a letter to the King. Presented with the letter and her cape, the King was surprised by the old woman's request to have him build a Church for the local people of her village. The King immediately ordered the cape destroyed, but was astonished to see gold coins falling from the cape. With the money he fulfilled the old woman's request from the rich bounty of her cape. From there the name "Capa-Rica" developed, for "capa" ("cape") and "rica" ("rich"), which became associated with the region.
Legend suggests that, in 1800, the Costa da Caparica was the site for the "Casa da Coroa" (the first house of rock and limestone) which received is importance for a little-known fact. It was believed that King John VI of Portugal in 1824 had eaten a delicious seafood stew, and for that reason, he ordered that the royal coat-of-arms be raised on the local fountain. Similarly, the site was the supposed way-point on journeys involving Queen Maria II of Portugal and King Pedro V of Portugal and his Royal Consort, who travelled through the Costa de Caparica on unrelated trips.
The territory was part of the parish of Caprica until 1926, before becoming an enclave Trafaria until 1949. The urban agglomeration was classified as a town on 9 July 1985, and elevated to the status of city on 9 December 2004.
It was the only freguesia in Almada which has not suffered any changes with the administrative reform of 2013.
Geography.
Physical geography.
Situate on the occidental coast of the Peninsula of Setúbal, the territory is the result of ocean receding, covering an area of 10.18 km² between the water and main escarpment. The space is one large beach resulting from progressive decline from the east to the sea. Its coastal extent represents the largest contiguous beach in Portugal, with an expanse of approximately 30 kilometres, from the left margin of the Tagus River to the estuary of Albufeira. Popular in the summer with tourists and local visitors, the beaches have suffered from erosion in recent years; several levels of Portuguese government have taken steps to reduce these patterns, but the erosion has continued at several of the beaches located closest to the mouth of the Tagus.
Ecoregions/Protected areas.
Portugal is bisected by geological and geomorphological landscapes of important interest, both for its scientific and natural appeal, such as the "Protected Landscape of the Ancient Beach of Costa da Caparica" (), a prehistoric beach landscape near Terras da Costa, that consist of intricately carved cliffs and erosional deposits, intersected by ravines and clifftops covered in vegetation. Its relative proximity to urban development and sprawl, coupled with progressive deterioration resulted in the 22 May 1984 decree-law 168/84 that constituted the "Paisagem Protegida" with the hope of preserving the geomorphological characteristics and the natural communities that existed within the territory, promoting a balance between the biology and landscape. On 24 November 2008, in a Council of Ministers resolution (178/2008) provided a mechanism for safeguarding the resources and natural value, establishing a specific use and management strategy for the area.
Although the "Arriba Fóssil" is the dominant scenic element of the protected area (PPAFCC), within its limits is the Reserva Botânica da Mata Nacional dos Medos (Botanical Reserve of the National Game Preserve of Medos), also referred to as "Pinhal do Rei" (the "King's Pineforest"), on which King John V of Portugal ordered the seeding of lands to reduce dune encroachment and deforestation. Also under the management of the PPAFCC, is the "Mata das Dunas da Costa da Caparica e Trafaria" ("Dunes Game Preserve of Costa da Caprica and Trafaria"), at the base of the beach; a 600 hectare area of forest, the "Mata das Dunas" is a natural forest still maintained.
Camping.
The main parks and camping sites in the parish include:
Human geography.
Although designated a city, and its public administration vested in the civil parish of Costa da Caparica, the area consists of several integrated communities and localities, including São João, Santo António, Terras da Costa and Fonte da Telha. With a population of 11,708 habitantes, it represents 7.3% of the municipal population. Similarly, it has the largest emigrant population in the population, particularly during the summer (when there are an additional 7,800 residents and on average about 35,000 visitors).
Economy.
The importance of the beach and sea is part of what makes the economy of Costa da Caparica function. Until the late 20th century, this was primarily with the fishing industry, but more so, with the seasonal tourist influx.
Architecture.
Owing to its modern, tourist-oriented, history, there are few architecturally significant buildings within its borders classified by the Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico (IGESPAR); these include:
Culture.
Much like other Portuguese communities, the communities of Costa da Caparica participate in secular and religious festivities and fairs throughout the year. These include the city's annual festival (January/February), the festival for local popular saints () in June, an arts/crafts and book fairs in July/August, and the artsans fair on the second Saturday and fourth Sunday of every month (except in July and August). The regions historical ties are also preserved in the "Concurso da Caldeirada Pescador" ("Fish Stew Competition") held in January/February and the "Feira de Velharias", held on the third and fifth Sunday of the month and holidays.
Sport.
The main sport clubs in the parish include:

Lincoln Case

Lincoln Case was a fictional character portrayed by actor Glenn Corbett on the 1960s American prime-time drama Route 66. Linc was one of three main regular characters on the program. His tenure began midway through the show's third season, when he was written in as a replacement for the departed Buz Murdock (played by George Maharis). Linc appeared in the final 32 of the program's 116 episodes as a sidekick to the character of Tod Stiles (played by Martin Milner).
The character has a certain historical significance. Linc was an Army Ranger returning from service in the Vietnam War, which in the early 1960s was just beginning to become a major concern of ordinary Americans. His appearance made Route 66 the first dramatic television series to feature a recurring character who was directly involved in Vietnam. Many scripts and storylines of the show featured Linc trying to come to terms with his wartime experiences and adjust to civilian life. (Corbett, who played Linc, was a Navy veteran who had served in Korea.) 
Linc's mother was portrayed by Linda Watkins in two episodes of the series. His father, Thomas, although an important character in Linc's tenure on the series, is never seen by the viewer and is only once briefly heard as a voice over the telephone.
Author David Morrell is on record as being a huge fan of the Route 66 series and credits it for his inspiration to become a writer. [http://www.davidmorrell.net/about.cfm] 
Stirling Silliphant, the primary creator of the series and the writer of the episode in which Linc Case was introduced, later authored a series of novels featuring another Vietnam veteran character, adventurer John Locke.
Character history.
Linc Case was introduced in the episode “Fifty Miles From Home,” first telecast on March 22, 1963. He is established as a native of the fictional town of Landor, Texas. He gives his age as 26 in an episode aired in early 1964; he is therefore most likely meant to be about 25 when we first meet him.
Linc arrives in Houston on his way home after finishing a tour of duty which included an escape from a Vietnam P.O.W. camp. He has been in the army for six years, and has been granted leave. While in Houston, Linc is physically harassed by a group of young collegians. His temper snaps, and he viciously attacks the youths, using advanced judo techniques mastered during his military career. Linc injures several of them, and maims for life a promising young basketball star.
An enraged Tod Stiles, a friend of some of the youths that Linc attacked, follows Linc back to his hometown, where a hero's welcome has been prepared for him. Tod and Linc fight to a draw when Linc holds himself back from using his judo on Tod. The two then come to a mutual respect for each other. Linc then pays a visit to his mother and relates some of his experiences in the war to her, including an incident in which a Vietnamese family sacrificed their own lives to hide him from the enemy. Linc tells his mother that he has no desire to attend the ceremonies for him, since the people of the town, in which Linc grew up a loner and outsider, cannot possibly understand or relate to his experiences. He also announces his attempt to search for meaning in his own life, and accordingly decides to join up with Tod and wander the country with him. Linc is still technically on leave from the army for his first several appearances, before finally making the decision to resign and become a civilian in the episode "Peace, Pity, Pardon".
A few episodes during Linc's tenure on the show brought him into contact with people and circumstances from his recent Vietnam past. In the segment “What a Shining Young Man Was Our Gallant Lieutenant,” Linc planned to pay a visit to his former commanding officer Lieutenant School (played by Dick York) living near Tampa. However, Linc learned that head injuries combined with trauma experienced by the man during the war had caused a mental collapse, and he subsequently believed himself to be an eight-year-old boy. Linc determined to stay with the Lieutenant as his “playmate” out of his past loyalty to the man, before finally coming to a realization that there could be no real place for him in the Lieutenant's world of perpetual childhood.
In another episode, “Like This it Means Tiger, Like This - Bitter, Like This - Father” (the title refers to the Chinese word Fu whose different pronunciations confer different meanings upon it), Linc was working in Savannah, Georgia. He ran into Camden Wilcox (played by Larry Blyden), a former member of his Vietnam unit whose act of cowardice during a skirmish had caused the deaths of two members of Linc's patrol. Linc brutally beat Wilcox and announced his intention of persecuting the man until he admitted his culpability. Linc eventually made his peace with Cam, however, as well as with his own memories of the incident.
At the time of his introduction to the series, Linc was estranged from his father, Thomas Case, feeling that the older man never attempted to understand him or relate to him as an individual. Linc steadfastly refused to visit or even speak to his father throughout most of his time on the series. This finally came to an end in the late fourth-season episode “Kiss the Monster, Make Him Sleep,” at the conclusion of which Linc finally gave into his mother's entreaties and called his father on the telephone, speaking to him for the first time since his departure from home. The elder Case broke down upon finally hearing his son's voice again.
In the two-part series finale of Route 66, “Where There's a Will, There's a Way,” after attending a funeral in Tampa involving some complex characters, Tod got married and Linc announced his own intention to return home.
Personality Traits.
With a slightly hard edge to his robustly handsome features and lightly colored eyes, Linc is a taciturn and introverted individual, in stark contrast to his expressively emotive predecessor Buz Murdock. Nonetheless, Linc beneath his often seemingly cold and indifferent exterior possesses a wealth of compassion and a droll, low-key sense of humor, as well as a strong sense of loyalty to those he considers his friends. However, he also harbors a fierce temper, which is quick to ignite. Linc's military service has taught him a number of conventional skills which prove handy in his ability to find many different kinds of work, as well as a few unconventional ones which he occasionally finds use for in his sometimes dangerous exploits with his friend Tod.

Goliath (La Ronde)

Goliath is a steel Hyper Coaster roller coaster at the La Ronde located in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, it reaches a maximum height of , a speed of , and a track length of . Construction commenced in September 2005, and the roller coaster opened to the public on May 13, 2006. Goliath was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada until it was surpassed by Behemoth (another Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster), at Canada's Wonderland's in 2008.
History.
Speculation that La Ronde would be building a new roller coaster began in the second half of 2004. Rumors that the roller coaster would be manufacutred by Bolliger & Mabillard emerged in September 2005. Construction for the roller coaster by Martin & Vleminckx began in September 2005 with land clearing and foundation pouring. The $18.7 million Goliath was announced on October 26, 2005. By mid-November, the storage bay was constructed with track pieces for the brake run and station being installed soon after. Construction on the lift hill continued throughout December and was topped off (the highest piece the lift hill) on December 21. The first drop was completed by mid-January 2006 followed by the first camelback hill which was completed by the end of February. After the second and third camelback hills were installed, the turnaround was completed in mid-March. The three camelback hills and banked turns leading back to the station were installed by the end of March marking the completion of installing track. The cars for the trains were also delivered in late March. After the cars were put on the track in April, testing began. Once testing was complete, Goliath opened to the public on May 13, 2006.
When "Goliath" opened, it was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada. Two years later, when Behemoth opened at Canada's Wonderland, Goliath lost both records.
Ride experience.
After being dispatched from the station, the train immediately begins to climb the lift hill. Once at the top, the train drops back down at a 70-degree angle. The train then makes a banked right turn leading into the first of three consecutive camelback hills; each at a height of , , and (every hill is smaller than the previous one). Following the third hill, the train enters a left hand turnaround that makes the train face the opposite direction that it came. After dropping back down to the ground, the train goes over another three camleback hills; each at a height of , , and . Then, the train makes an upward right banked turn, immediately followed by a downward left banked turn. After another lfet banked turn, the train rises back up and goes over a small bump before entering the final brake run. The train then makes a 180-degree right turn leading back to the station. One cycle of the ride lasts about three minutes.
Characteristics.
Track.
The steel track of Goliath is approximately long, and the height of the lift is high. It is made up of 150 foundations, 300 pilings, 106 supports, and 850 anchor bolts. The roller coasters has no inversions though it does feature seve camelback hills. The track is painted red with yellow rails while the supports are painted blue. It was manufactured by Clermont Steel Fabricators located in Batavia, Ohio.
Though Goliath is a B&M Hyper Coaster (the model name for this type of B&M roller coaster), the roller coaster is technically not classified as a Hypercoaster. A Hypercoaster is any roller coaster that reaches a height over ; "Goliath" reaches only .
Trains.
"Goliath" operates with two steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has nine cars which can seat four riders in a single row, for a total of 36 riders per train; each seat has its own individual lab-bar restraint. The structure of the trains are colored yellow, red and blue. The seats are blue and the restraints are yellow.
Awards.
In "Goliath's" opening year, it was voted the 37th best steel roller coaster in "Amusement Today's" Golden Ticket Awards. The roller coaster peaked at position 23 in 2011. It did not place in the top five new roller coasters for 2006.
In Mitch Hawker's Best Steel Roller Coaster Poll, "Goliath" was voted as the 25th best steel roller coaster in the world in its first year; it peaked at position 14 in 2009.

Meredith Belbin

Meredith Belbin is a British researcher and management theorist best known for his work on management teams. He is a visiting professor and Honorary Fellow of Henley Management College in Oxfordshire, England.
Early life and work.
Raymond Meredith Belbin was born in 1926. He took both his first and second degrees, Classics and then Psychology at Clare College, Cambridge. His first appointment after his doctorate was as a research fellow at Cranfield College (now Cranfield School of Management at Cranfield University). His early research focused mainly on older workers in industry. He returned to Cambridge and joined the Industrial Training Research Unit (ITRU) where his wife Eunice was director and he subsequently became chairman. Belbin combined this job with acting as OECD consultant running successful demonstration projects in Sweden, Austria, UK and the United States.
It was while at ITRU, in the late 1960s, that Belbin was invited to carry out research at what was then called the Administrative Staff College at Henley-on-Thames. The work which formed the basis of his 1981 classic took several years and, after publication, it was some time before its real importance was recognised. Having an interest in group as well as individual behaviour, but with no particular theories about teams, Belbin enlisted the aid of three other scholars: Bill Hartston, mathematician and international chess master; Jeanne Fisher, an anthropologist who had studied Kenyan tribes; and Roger Mottram, an occupational psychologist. Together they began what was to be a seven-year task. Three business games a year, with eight teams in each game, and then in meeting after meeting, observing, categorising and recording all the different kinds of contribution from team members.
In 1988, Belbin established, with his son Nigel, Belbin Associates to publish and promote his research.
Belbin's research.
Belbin's 1981 book "Management Teams" presented conclusions from his work studying how members of teams interacted during business games run at Henley Management College. Amongst his key conclusions was the proposition that an effective team has members that cover eight (later nine) key roles in managing the team and how it carries out its work. This may be separate from the role each team member has in carrying out the work of the team.
Practical implications.
Based on Belbin's model of nine team roles, managers or organisations building working teams would be advised to ensure that each of the roles can be performed by a team member. Some roles are compatible and can be more easily fulfilled by the same person; some are less compatible and are likely to be done well by people with different behavioural clusters. This means that a team need not be as many as nine people, but perhaps should be at least three or four.
While comparisons can be drawn between Belbin's behavioural team roles and personality types, the roles represent tasks and functions in the self-management of the team's activities. Tests exist to identify ideal team roles, but this does not preclude an extravert from being a Completer Finisher, nor an introvert from being a Resource Investigator.
Criticisms of the model.
While Belbin's model has become well known and is taught as a standard part of much management training, there are many criticisms of both the model itself and the way it is sometimes erroneously used.
The research which identified these roles was conducted on established executives studying at the Administrative Staff College at Henley (now renamed Henley Management College); they were selected for the prestigious course by their firms who had identified them as high-fliers expected to go on to senior management. The sample was therefore already highly selective. Belbin himself points out in his book that many people that might otherwise have made excellent managers might have de-selected themselves from attending the programme.
The exercises given consisted of a game designed to simulate business decision-making with an emphasis on generating profit in a fictitious company, and a version of Monopoly specially adapted to remove the chance elements and enable groups to play in teams against other teams. While Belbin draws on examples from real organisations, the development of the model is based on the behaviour of subjects in the artificial environment of the business school exercise.
Some people teach that all eight/nine roles must be present for a team to function well. Belbin himself acknowledges that some teams consisting of one Shaper and a group of "yes" men perform well, especially where predictability was high. His book identifies a number of combinations that performed well in the exercises, especially where the teams were aware of "missing" roles within their ranks.
Some people attempt to match Belbin's roles with Carl Jung's eight personality types, with the nine types of the Enneagram of Personality or another personality type classification. Belbin is at pains to point out that the team roles are not personality types. He regards them as clusters of characteristics, of which psychological preference is but one dimension. Citation?
Automated Belbin reports, available from some management training companies should not, therefore, be used as the basis for recruitment or promotion decisions.
The weakness of the shaper is that they might become bad tempered/bad humored when getting things done.
The weakness of an Implementer is that they are sometimes slow to relinquish their plans in positive manner.
A finisher can put too much detail into one section and not follow a specified time frame. 
A Co-ordinator can be considered overly enthusiastic at times.
Team worker may find it difficult to make decisions on own.
Resource investigator may forget to follow a lead.

Chronology of Stanley Cup engravings

This is a chronology of Stanley Cup engravings.
A unique feature of the Stanley Cup is that, with few exceptions in the past, it is the only trophy in professional sports that has the name of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff engraved on it.
This has not always been the case. When he first donated the Cup in 1892, one of Lord Stanley of Preston's original conditions was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring on the Cup to commemorate their Cup victory (the first year being an exception). Lord Stanley's original trophy was simply a silver bowl minted with the words "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup" on one side of the outside rim, and "From Stanley of Preston" with his family's coat of arms on the other side.
The format and location of the engravings, including the addition and deletion of extra bands and rings attached to the bottom of Lord Stanley's original cup/bowl, has changed through the years. For unknown reasons some teams (details below), did not engrave their names on the Cup. This was rectified in the '1948 Redesign'.
Challenge Cup Era.
During the Challenge Cup Era from 1893–1914, the Stanley Cup was a "challenge trophy"; the champions held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently defeated the reigning Cup champion in a special game or series. 
Teams had to add their names to the trophy at their own expense. Initially, there was only one ring, the one added by the first Cup champion Montreal HC. Clubs then engraved their team names, usually in the form "NAME WON", on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no room to engrave their names (perhaps unwilling to pay for a second band to the Cup), teams started leaving their mark on the bowl itself. A second ring was finally added by the Ottawa Senators in 1909. As mentioned earlier in this article, some teams during this era did not engrave their names on the Cup.
"(*) Note: The Winnipeg Victorias engraved "1895" instead of "1896" because they won their Stanley Cup Challenge against Montreal prior to the end of the 1896 season.
The "World Series" Era.
Before the 1914–15 season, a new agreement was reached in which the respective champions of the NHA and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association would face each other for the Cup, similar to baseball's World Series played between the American League and National League champions.
This agreement effectively ended the Challenge Cup rule in which a new champion was crowned after it won the title of the previous champion's league. However, the 1915 Ottawa Senators, the 1916 Portland Rosebuds, and the 1918 Vancouver Millionaires all engraved their names on the Cup even though they did not officially win it under the new system.
The NHA dissolved in 1917, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place. Then after the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) was born in 1921, it was agreed that all three league champions would play for the Cup. The PCHA and the WCHL later merged to form the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1924.
The NHL takes over the Cup, and the "Stovepipe".
The WHL folded before the 1926-27 season began. As a result, the Cup has since been awarded to the annual NHL champions.
Once the Cup became, effectively, the NHL championship trophy, the engraving of the Cup winner's information became a consistent annual tradition. This means that no Cup winning team has been missed since the 1922-23 Ottawa Senators chose to leave their name off the Cup.
Originally, a new band was added almost every year, causing the Cup to grow in size. Thus, it became commonly referred to as the "Stovepipe Cup" because of its resemblance to the exhaust pipe of a stove. It was also occasionally called the "cigar" Cup or the "elephant's leg" Cup for similar reasons.
The 1948 redesign.
With the Stovepipe Cup becoming impractical because of its ever-increasing height, the NHL decided to redesign the trophy.
The base of the Stovepipe Cup (all of the bands before the New York Rangers' 1928 ring) was moved back to the top directly under the bowl. A new shoulder collar was added below, onto which only the names of the previous winning teams were engraved. This new shoulder includes all winning team names only. The 1908, 1910 Montreal Wanderers, 1911 Ottawa Senators, 1918 Toronto Arenas, 1922 Toronto St. Pats, 1920, 1921, 1923 Ottawa Senators team names were finally added to the Cup. The cancelled 1919 Stanley Cup Finals was also acknowledged with "1919/Montreal Canadiens/Seattle Metropolitans/Series Not Completed". Room was left on the new collar for future teams.
All of the 1927–28 to 1945–46 rings from the Stovepipe Cup were redone into nine bands of various heights that were attached below the new collar, forming a vastly expanded barrel-like body. The first 5 rings and half the sixth ring included the winners 1928, 1930 to 1939. There was room to add one more team the sixth band. 1956 was winner added later. Underneath that was a replica of the wide 1940 band from the Stovepipe Cup, but expanded to allow room for all winners from 1940 to 1951. The 1946–47 Cup champion Toronto Maple Leafs, who had to wait a year because of the redesign, was also added to the wide band. Finally, two more narrow blank bands were added to the bottom of the trophy for the winners 1952 to 1955.
The 1957 redesign.
As soon as the 1956 Montreal Canadiens added their names to the Cup, all of the various narrow and wide bands of the trophy's barrel was full. Therefore, they were replaced with five symmetrical bands, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. The winning teams and rosters from 1927–28 to 1939–40 were engraved on the first band, the 1940–41 to 1952–53 champions on the second band, and the 1953–54 winners onward on the third band.
Although the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year, the names of the 1964–65 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted (and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13). Also the Cup underwent several minor alterations, namely the retirement of the collar in 1963 and the bowl in 1969 in favor of duplicates because the originals became too brittle.
The top ring is retired.
After the bands were finally all filled, the top band of the large barrel, with the 1927–28 to 1939–40 champions, was taken to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was introduced at the bottom so the size of the Stanley Cup would not grow further.
One year later, the shoulder collar listing the names of the previous winners was also filled to capacity, but it was decided to keep it on the trophy, unchanged in perpetuity. 1991-92 Pittsburgh Penguins was last winning team to be engraved on the collar. 
A second ring is retired.
The band listing the 1940–41 to 1952–53 Cup winners was scheduled to be retired following the crowning of the 2004–05 champions. However, that season was cancelled because of a labour dispute. The ring was finally taken to the Hockey Hall of Fame one year later after the 2005–06 champion Carolina Hurricanes were crowned. In addition to listing the names of the Hurricanes on the new bottom ring, it was decided to also acknowledge the cancelled 2004–05 season. The next ring retirement is scheduled to occur after the 2016–17 season.

Parashu

The parashu () is an Indian battle-axe. It is generally wielded with two hands but could also be used with only one.
Construction.
The parashu could be double edged or bladed or single-bladed with a spike on the non cutting edge. It usually measures between 3 – 5 feet though some are as long as 7 feet. The parashu is usually made of iron or wootz steel. The cutting edge is broader than the edge which is attached to the haft. The haft is often tied with a leather sheet to provide a good grip.
In Hinduism.
The parashu is the weapon of Lord Shiva who gave it to Parashurama, sixth Avatar of Vishnu, whose name means "Rama with the axe" and also taught him its mastery. He was one of the few Brahmin guru who were also masters of hand to hand combat. He is known as the founder of Kalaripayattu, ancient Indian martial art. Parashurama was the guru of Dronacharya, the guru who instructed the Pandavas in the epic of the Mahabharata. Bhishma and Karna, half brother of Pandava also took instruction in weaponry from Parashurama, a disciple of lord Shiva, and was known to have terrible temper having lost his father to the evil Asura. In his anger, Parashurama used the parashu to get rid of the all the Earth's tyrannical kshatriya (warrior class) twenty one times over. Parashurama's weapon had supernatural powers. It had four cutting edges, one on each end of the blade head and one on each end of the shaft. 
The parashu was known as the most lethal close combat weapons of the epics. It is also one of the weapons of Lord Shiva and Goddess Durga and is still depicted on their idols throughout India.

Nevio Pizzolitto

Nevio Pizzolitto (born August 26, 1976 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian soccer player who most recently played for Montreal Impact in the North American Soccer League.
Career.
Youth.
Pizzolitto began playing youth soccer with the with Sporting-Patriotes of the Quebec Elite Soccer League in 1990. He was picked several times on the LSEQ all-star teams, was also proclaimed Defender of the Year. He helped helping Sporting-Patriotes reach the national club championship in the U15 category in 1990, and later went on to win the national title at the U19 level in 1994.
Professional.
Pizzolitto signed with Montreal Impact in the summer of 1995, becoming an important key to Montreal's defence. Where he has helped the Impact win the league championship in 2004, as well as the regular-season title from 1995 to 1997, and 2005 to 2006. As well as claiming the Voyageurs Cup six years in row. In 2005 he helped the Impact to a 15-game undefeated streak which marked a new league record. He was picked on the second All-League team from 2004 to 2006, and was named the Impact’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2005.
Early in his career he had a short spell in Italy, with Serie D side Imperia.
On July 16, 2006, he played his 200th career game with the Montreal club, becoming the third player in club history to reach that mark after Nick De Santis and Mauro Biello. On July 26, 2006, he climbed to third place in club history for career minutes played with the Impact, surpassing Patrick Diotte. He helped Montreal come up with 10 shutouts at home, tying a club record, and allow only four goals at home, marking a new club record in 2006.
On December 2, 2008 the Montreal Impact announced the re-signing of central defenders Pizzolitto and Stefano Pesoli to a two year contract. During the 2009 season he helped the Impact maintain the second best defense in the league, by only allowing in 28 goals in 30 games. On June 28, 2008 he reached a milestone with the club by playing his 220th career match, surpassing Nick De Santis for second spot in club history. In the Nutrilite Canadian Championship, he helped win the 2008 Nutrilite Canadian Championship for the Impact which meant the club qualified to the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League.

Sensitivity training

Sensitivity Training is a form of training with the goal of making people more aware of their own prejudices and more sensitive to others.
According to his biographer, Alfred J. Marrow, Kurt Lewin laid the foundations for sensitivity training in a series of workshops he organised in 1946 to carry out a 'change' experiment, in response to a request from the Director of the Connecticut State Interracial Commission. This led to the founding of the National Training Laboratories in Bethel, Maine in 1947. Kurt Lewin, who met Eric Trist in 1933, influenced the work of the London, England, United Kingdom Tavistock Clinic, both in its work with soldiers during the second world war and in its later work with the Journal Human Relations jointly founded by a partnership of the Tavistock Institute and Lewin's group at MIT.
During World War II, Psychologists like Carl Rogers in the USA and William Sargant, John Rawlings Rees, and Eric Trist in Britain were used by the military to help soldiers deal with traumatic stress disorders (then known as shell shock). This work, which required service to large numbers of patients by a small number of therapists and necessarily emphasized rapidity and effectiveness helped spur the development of group therapy as a treatment technique. Rogers and others evolved their work into new forms including encounter groups designed for persons who were not diagnosably ill but who were recognized to have widespread problems associated with isolation from others common in American society. Other leaders in the development of encounter groups, including Will Schutz, worked at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California.
Meanwhile, Training Groups or T-Groups were being developed at the National Training Labs, now part of the National Education Association. Over time the techniques of T-Groups and Encounter Groups have merged and divided and splintered into specialized topics, seeking to promote sensitivity to others perceived as different and seemingly losing some of their original focus on self-exploration as a means to understanding and improving relations with others in a more general sense.
Criticisms.
The nature of modern Sensitivity Training appears to be in some dispute. Its modern critics portray its origins and function in negative terms. Others view the approach as benignly beneficial in many of its historical and contemporary implementations.
According to its critics, sensitivity training involves the use of psychological techniques with groups that its critics, such as G. Edward Griffin, claim are often identical to brainwashing tactics. Critics believe these techniques are unethical.

Morgan Corinthos

Morgan Stone Corinthos is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, "General Hospital", currently portrayed by Bryan Craig. Morgan is the only biological child of Sonny and Carly Corinthos.
The character was created under head writers, Robert Guza, Jr. and Charles Pratt, Jr. and introduced by executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, as a new born on October 24, 2003. In 2009, the character is rapidly aged and the role was recast with actor Aaron Refvem in 2009, and later Aaron Sanders in 2010. A young Morgan becomes a linch pin character for the Corinthos family, as they deal with Sonny's long lost son, Dante Falconeri coming to put an end to Sonny's time as a mob boss. Morgan is often put in uncomfortable positions because he has grown to adore Dante, but also loves Sonny and his brother, Michael whose lives have been turned upside down by Dante. The character is written out of the series in the summer of 2011 by head writer, Garin Wolf, and sent off to military school.
Craig's Morgan is introduced in 2013 under head writer Ron Carlivati and executive producer, Frank Valentini. Morgan's return immediately causes trouble for his entire family as he unknowingly starts a mob war with the rival Jerome family, and is also dating a member of the family, Kiki. Morgan and Kiki's budding romance is upset by her attraction to Michael. Michael and Kiki's relationship, as well as Sonny and Carly's willing acceptance of their romance highlights Morgan's feelings of resentment toward his family. Morgan accuses Sonny and Carly of favoring Michael, and he in turn begins an affair with his then mother-in-law, Ava Jerome, and also begins working for the rival crime family to undermine his father.
Creation.
Casting.
Upon the character's onscreen birth, the role of Morgan was portrayed by twins, Isador Talamo and Adonios Talamo. Jordan and Dylan Cline then appeared in the role from 2004 to 2005. George Juarez stepped into the role in late 2005. Juarez last appeared as Morgan in April 2009. On May 12, 2009, Aaron Refvem made his first appearance as Morgan, on a recurring basis. In the spring of 2010, Refvem reported that he had landed a role in a prime time series, but said that he didn't expect it to interfere in his work schedule for "GH". A day later, ABC released a statement which confirmed that Refvem had been replaced due to a scheduling conflict. Refvem departed from the series on May 4, 2010 leaving for a role in the pilot of "This Little Piggy". Aaron Sanders took over and first appeared on April 14, 2010. Sanders made his last appearance on July 21, 2011. In July 2012, Refvem revealed confirmed on "Twitter" the possibility of his return to the role of Morgan. Though the series never commented on Refvem's statement, head writer, Ron Carlivati hinted at the possibility. In December 2012, the series released a casting call for a white male, between the ages of 14 and 17. There was speculation that the character was a recast for the role of Morgan. In March 2013, it was reported that Drew Osborne had filmed scenes with Maurice Benard; Osborne's striking resemblance to Chad Duell led to speculation that he could be Morgan or a recast of Duell's character, Michael. Later, message board posters began reporting that Craig had been cast in the role of Morgan despite no official confirmation from ABC. On April 17, 2013, after months of speculation from fans, a rep from the show confirmed the news that Bryan Craig had been cast in the role of Morgan. Craig began filming his first scenes on April 15. Though no official airdate was announced, Craig's first appearance was slated for May 2013 on a contractual basis. Craig later revealed to "Soap Opera Digest" that he was hesitant to do a soap. However, the role of Morgan changed his mind about daytime. However, it was his parents who convinced him to take sign a three year contract.
Characterization.
The December 2012 casting call described the character as being "[and complex" with "intensity beyond his years." Angela Durrell of "TV Source" described the character of Morgan as "ensitive and emotionally wounded." Morgan craves "strong ties" and stability. Mara Levinsky described Craig's Morgan as "impulsive" and "imperfect." Michael Logan described Craig's Morgan as a "marvelous muddle of puppy awkwardness and testy testosterone." When asked about his character's "casual and low-key," wardrobe, despite his family being filthy rich, Craig said Morgan is all about quick cash, but "far from snooty." He is the kind of guy that sleeps all day, and eats pizza for breakfast. His sense of style reflects his laid back personality. Susan Hornik described Craig's Morgan as a "Prince Harry-esque, bad boy."
Development.
I ntroduction (2003).
After overcoming the threat of Sonny's longtime love, Brenda Barrett (Vanessa Marcil), Sonny and Carly (Tamara Braun) reunite and plan to make Michael (Dylan Cash) a big brother. On February 4, 2003, Sonny and Carly make love for the first time since their reunion. GH writer, Elizabeth Korte wouldn't confirm or deny the pregnancy, but said that several events that had recently played out could make viewers think a baby is coming. "ABC Soaps In Depth" hinted that if Carly were pregnant, the child's birth would coincide with November "Sweeps". This would be Sonny's first opportunity to witness the birth of one of his children. The series had recently introduced Sonny's vengeful brother, Ric Lansing (Rick Hearst) who takes an interest in the Corinthos clan, and Carly specifically. Ric drugs Carly on February 17/18 and leads her to believe they have slept together. Carly is unaware of her baby's paternity. Ric's wife Elizabeth (Rebecca Herbst) miscarries in May 2003 and he blames Sonny. Meanwhile, Sonny and Carly happily prepare for the birth of their child, as Ric obsesses over the miscarriage. He formulates a plan and buys a house with a secret panic room. Ric kidnaps grabs Carly before her best friends' wedding and locks her in the panic room. Carly escapes only to be kidnapped by rival crime lord, Lorenzo Alcazar (Ted King). Carly goes into false labor, and is eventually rescued by Sonny, Jason and Ric himself. Meanwhile, the constant danger begins to remind Sonny of how he lost his first wife, Lily (Lilly Melgar) and their unborn child in a car explosion; Lily even appears to Sonny accusing him of putting the child in danger. Then head writer, Robert Guza revealed that Lily's prophecy would come true as Carly faces major complications while giving birth. All alone, Carly falls down a flight of stairs and goes into labor and she is discovered by Alcazar. Sonny mistakenly believes Alcazar is hurting Carly, and shoots him. The bullet is lodged in Carly's head, and she falls into a coma shortly after giving birth on October 24, 2003. Maurice Benard and Tamara Braun revealed to "Soaps In Depth" that the filming of the birth scenes felt extremely real. The eight week old infant was covered in a jelly like substance to make it look like a new born. After the birth, Carly passes out from the gun shot wound, forcing Braun to play the rest of the scenes with her eyes closed. According to Braun, her connection with Benard was on a different level, and she felt the need to actually comfort him. Benard admitted that he became extremely emotional after the taping and couldn't stop crying. Those watching were also in tears. During a fan gathering in 2003, Tamara Braun had fans submit suggestions for the child's name. Braun and her co-star Maurice Benard looked through the names and presented some of the suggestions to the writers. The character is named for his godfather Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), and the late Stone Cates (Michael Sutton); who died from AIDS as a teenager.
Preteen years (2009–11).
With Refvem's casting, the character was aged from 8 to 12 years of age. Upon the return of Robin Christopher's Skye Chandler in 2010, some hoped that the series would age her daughter, Lila Rae Alcazar, and make her a love interest for Morgan. The potential romance would definitely cause trouble considering Lila Rae's father, the late Lorenzo Alcazar (Ted King) was once Sonny's most formidable opponent. Instead of taking the young character in a romantic direction, Morgan develops a relationship with mob soldier Dominic Pirelli (Dominic Zamprogna) when he saves him from being hit by a car at the General Hospital carnival. The two then bond over baseball only for Dominic to be shot by Sonny who discovers he is an undercover cop. It is then revealed that Dominic is actually Sonny's son, Dante Falconeri, which complicates his relationship with Morgan a bit more. Morgan is later forced to testify against his father during a murder trial and he is put in the position of having to choose between saving his father, or revealing the truth about his brother Michael's part in their stepmother Claudia (Sarah Brown)'s murder. Though Dante manages to protect Morgan, he then controversially tricks Morgan into revealing Michael's whereabouts. The character is written off-canvas in the summer of 2011.
Return (2013).
With Craig's casting, the character of Morgan was rapidly aged to 19 years old. Morgan "will be bring trouble in his wake!" said "Soap Opera Digest". The character's "reintegration" would be anything but smooth. Michael Fairman of "On-Air On-Soaps" questioned "Just what will Morgan’s disposition be ike when he returns to Port Charles?" due to Sonny and Carly being his parents. Regan Cellura of "Daytime Confidential" reported that Morgan runs into trouble in the mob. The departing Brandon Barash, who played Johnny Zacchara alerts Connie Falconeri (Kelly Sullivan) of Morgan's predicament. According to head writer, Ron Carlivati, the canvas was ripe for Morgan's return. While attending Vanderbilt University, Morgan wracks up some gambling debts putting his loved ones in danger; while Morgan hides out, his roommate, Travis (Drew Osborne) is left to fend for himself. Though he barely escapes with his life, Morgan appears to have developed a gambling addiction, much like his grandfather, Mike Corbin (Ron Hale). In June 2013, Craig is injured with a broken arm and the writers decide to write the injury in. Initial rumors had Morgan being attacked by debt collectors; however, the injury is instead scripted as a wrestling move gone wrong with Alice Gunderson (Bergen Williams). It appears that Morgan had overcome his gambling addiction.
Romantic triangle.
On May 14, 2013, it is revealed that Morgan and Kiki have been dating. Kiki and Morgan's relationship is immediately met with opposition due to her involvement in his gambling. A Soapnet promo indicated that Alderson's Kiki could potentially drive a wedge between Michael and Morgan. Morgan is usually being protected by Michael, but now that he's older and he wants to prove to Kiki that he's a good catch, "a 'perfect' big brother is not what Morgan needs." Carlivati explained that Morgan is the Prince Harry to Michael's Prince William. Morgan is all about having fun which and the responsible Michael sees Morgan as acting like a "screw-up". Craig told "Soap Opera Digest" that Morgan notices the tension between Kiki and Michael but he had yet to understand how far their relationship had progressed. Though Morgan rushes Kiki into marriage, and he is truly in love with her, Morgan needs to keep her away from Michael. In August 2013, Craig said that he did not know who Kiki would end up with but knew for sure that any future romance between Michael and Kiki would drive a wedge between the brothers. When Michael's biological father, A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) becomes the prime suspect in the murder of Sonny's girlfriend, it causes even more tension; Morgan immediately wants to come forward about finding A. J.'s gun, while Kiki wants to spare Michael's feelings. Morgan's need for "justice" is fueled by his jealousy. Craig admitted that the storyline made things a bit awkward due to the fact that Duell and Alderson were dating in real life. However, Morgan and Kiki's relationship is doomed from the start. An unstable Sonny, decides to expose that Morgan knew the truth of about Kiki's paternity before he married her. Morgan is humiliated The stage is set to put Morgan at odds with his entire family, including his father played by Emmy winner Maurice Benard. The fall out also culminates in Morgan falling into bed with his mother-in-law, Ava Jerome (Maura West).
Storylines.
Morgan is christened on December 2003, with Jason and Sonny's sister Courtney Matthews (Alicia Leigh Willis) as his godparents. He later attends a private Catholic school, Queen of Angels. In March 2005, Morgan and his siblings, Kristina and Michael are temporarily kidnapped by A. J. Quartermaine (then Billy Warlock), but are rescued by Jason and his then girlfriend, Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco). Carly marries Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) in April 2007. He and Morgan form a close bond and Jax considers Morgan his own. In August 2010 Morgan goes to see Sonny, despite his mother's wishes. Sonny talks with him, until Carly arrives. Carly sends Morgan home, and explains to Sonny that she is making up for past mistakes with Michael; she does not want Morgan to be around Sonny, due to his violent life. Carly asks her husband, Jax to adopt Morgan, and he agrees; however, they are unable to complete the process before Jax disappears. In late December 2010 and early January 2011 Morgan, Molly (Haley Pullos), Kristina (Lexi Ainsworth), Michael (Chad Duell) and other Port Charles residents are on their way to a ski resort when the bus crashes. Morgan is thrown from the bus and separated from the others with a broken leg. He later attends Sonny and Brenda's wedding and Carly allows Morgan to begin having contact with Sonny again. In July, Morgan and Molly kidnap his sister Josslyn in an attempt to stop Jax from taking Josslyn away from Carly upon their divorce; however the plan fails when Kristina discovers them. In the summer 2011, after Jax is presumed dead in a plane crash, Carly enrolls Morgan in military school to protect him from Sonny's influence, using her maiden name, "Benson". According to Carly, Morgan is relieved that he no longer has to live with the stigma of being a mobster's son, and he is adjusting well at school.
In 2013, Morgan (Craig) is found to be living with his girlfriend Kiki (Kristen Alderson) and his girlfriend's mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) in New York City, where Michael tracks him down after he is attacked and left for dead. Sonny steps in to protect Morgan from another beating and Morgan moves in with Michael. Kiki also moves in the brothers and Morgan notices the sexual tension between them. He is relieved when the two are revealed to be cousins, and Morgan and Kiki move into the Quartermaine boat house. Morgan eventually learns that Kiki and Michael aren't related, but withholds the information. Morgan confesses the truth to Sonny and convinces him to keep the secret while he marries Kiki. Though Kiki's paternity is exposed, the couple has already married. Even when at odds, Morgan and Michael come together to rescue Sonny when his girlfriend Connie is murdered. At Kiki and Morgan's wedding party, Sonny breaks down and reveals that Morgan knew about Kiki's paternity before they married. Following the revelation, Morgan begins sleeping with Ava. Morgan later moves in with Ava, against his family's wishes. Morgan accidentally discovers that Ava, and her brother, Julian Jerome (William deVry) are going after his Sonny's crime organization and is forced to turn against Sonny in exchange for his life. However, Morgan uses the situation as a way to get revenge on his father and brother.
Reception.
Early recasts.
Jen Snyder of "TV Source" was relieved that the "much anticipated" aging had finally come upon the announcement of Refvem's casting. Refvem was immediately a hit with fans a critics alike. In October 2009, Soapnet listed the young actor as the "Performer of the Week" for the week of September 28, 2009 for Morgan's toast at the wedding of Supercouple, Damian Spinelli and Maxie Jones. The article categorized Refvem as one of the best child actors in daytime and described his performance as "the very definition of adorable." Refvem was applauded for his performance in February 2010 in which his character Morgan attempted to play peacemaker between his new brother, Dante and his uncle Jason despite the fact that Dante was trying to send their father to prison. His work was considered "Emmy" worthy. In 2010, Refvem was nominated by The Young Artist Foundation for the "Best Performance in a TV Series by a Recurring Younger Actor, 13 years old and younger." Upon Refvem's departure, Sara Bibel of "Deep Soap" said she hoped his replacement would be just as talented but commented how weird it would be considering the role of Morgan's brother had also been recast. An article on Soapnet.com described Refvem's tenure as "adorably excellent" and referred to the news of his departure as "bittersweet." The piece also applauded Refvem for being able to hold his own opposite veterans such as Maurice Benard as Sonny, Laura Wright as Carly, and Dominic Zamprogna as Dante. "Soaps In Depth" urged the already angry fans not to blame ABC for Refvem's ousting because it was beyond their control. "Soap Central's" Tamilu had a tough time accepting Sanders in the role and explained that Drew Garrett's ousting as Michael was already enough for viewers to deal with, and losing a beloved actor like Refvem was a bit shocking. She said the climactic scenes in which Morgan discovered Michael's prison sentence kind of fell flat due to the sudden recast. However, the user praised Refvem for being able to "cry at the drop of a hat" and said that he oozed sincerity. With the installation of new head-writer Garin Wolf, some advised the scribe to bring Refvem back as Morgan. Despite some mixed reviews early on, other critics began to accept Sanders as the "NuMorgan." Michael Fairman applauded Sanders for his performance during a scene in February 2011 in which Morgan learned of Carly and Jax's separation. Fairman said Sanders "delivered a very real and emotional moment." Sanders was also nominated for a Young Artist Award for his portrayal of Morgan in February 2011.
Bryan Craig.
According to head writer, Ron Carlivati, fans had been asking for Morgan's return since early 2012. "Morgan finally returns!" said Michael Fairman of Craig's casting referring to the character's 2 year absence. "TV Source Magazine" described Craig's May 8 debut as Morgan as the episode's "big surprise" considering it coincided with the much anticipated debut of Emmy winner Maura West as Ava Jerome. Michael Fairman said, "lo and behold" of Craig's surprising debut. Bryan Craig was a hit with his cast mates and fans. Though his portrayal of Morgan initially received mixed reviews, a lot of viewers eventually came to enjoy Craig in the role, despite Morgan's actions. The confrontation scenes at Morgan and Kiki's wedding party were praised in "Soap Opera Digest". A viewer from Minnesota said Craig had finally grown into the role and also praised the writers for addressing Sonny's favoritism of Michael. Craig ranked at #1 on "Daytime Confidential's" list of the "10 Best Soap Opera Newbies" in the year 2013. The praised Craig for his portrayal of Morgan and said the actor "engaged in a delicate dance of pathos and mania" when Morgan begs Sonny to keep the secret about Kiki's paternity. The website said Craig would have a future as an Emmy winner.
Craig received his first Daytime Emmy Award nomination in the Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series category for his portrayal of Morgan.
Relationships.
When Craig and West shared their first scenes, "Daytime Confidential" encouraged a potential romance due to the chemistry between the two actors. 76% of voters hoped the two would eventually hook up. Morgan's shocking romance with his mother-in-law Ava was a hit with many fans and critics alike and garnered the portmanteau, "AMor". The pairing also made "TV Guide's" "HOT LIST" for the year 2013. The magazine said, "…nothing prepped us for such illicit cougar love… or how much we'd dig it!" Of the pairing, Michael Logan said, "It's so wrong, it's right." Mara Levinsky praised Craig for his portrayal of Morgan following his first tryst with Ava. The plot twist also resulted in the character's name trending for several consecutive days on "Twitter". A poll on "Daytime Confidential" saw 73% of voters wanted to see more of Morgan and Ava's relationship. The couple ranked at #4 on "Daytime Confidential's" list of the "10 Best Soap Opera Couples" for the year. "If General Hospital bottled the chemistry shared by mob legacies Ava Jerome (Maura West) and Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig), the soap would be able to sustain a $100 million annual operating budget."

Fake security camera

Fake security cameras (or dummy cameras, simulated cameras, decoy cameras), are non-functional surveillance cameras designed to fool intruders, or anyone who it is supposedly watching. Those cameras are intentionally placed in a noticeable place, so passing people notice them and believe the area to be monitored by CCTV.
The cheapest fake security cameras can be recognized by not having real lenses (the "lenses" are just an opaque piece of plastic) Other fake cameras include broken real cameras, motion sensors disguised as cameras, or empty camera housings. They may have flashing lights, or a motor to simulate pan-tilt motion.

<doc id="5885814" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5885814" title="Tia Hellebaut">
Tia Hellebaut

Tia Hellebaut (; born 16 February 1978 in Antwerp) is a retired Belgian track and field athlete, who started out in the heptathlon, but afterwards specialized in the high jump event. She has cleared 2.05 metres both indoors and outdoors.
Hellebaut was the 2008 Olympic champion in the high jump. She was previously the European Champion in 2006 and then the European Indoor Champion in 2007. She won the gold medal in the pentathlon at the 2008 IAAF World Indoor Championships. In addition to these medals, she has participated at the World Championships in Athletics on four occasions.
She holds the Belgian records indoor pentathlon, indoor long jump and high jump, both indoors and outdoors.
Career.
Hellebaut started as a professional athlete with Atletiek Vlaanderen in the period from 2001 to October 2005. From 1 November 2006 she again became a professional athlete, this time at Bloso. During her most successful period, Hellebaut was trained by her partner, Wim Vandeven, at her club, Atletica 84.
At the 2006 European Championships and 2007 Indoor European Championships Hellebaut won the gold medal in high jump. The 2006 victory became especially notable, when just a couple of minutes later her close friend and compatriot Kim Gevaert completed a historical sprint double. The images of both athletes celebrating their victory together, wrapped in a national flag, became part of Belgian sports history.
In 2007 Hellebaut set the fourth best pentathlon score of all time, but chose not to contest the European Indoor Championships because of illness, choosing instead to compete only in the high jump, which she later won. Most of the remainder of her 2007 high jump season was hampered by an ankle injury. A shoulder injury, which made it difficult for her to throw the javelin, ended her career in heptathlon around this time.
For the 2008 indoor season, Hellebaut returned her focus to multi-events and became world champion of pentathlon at the World Indoor Championships in Valencia, where she set a secord for the best high jump result in a women's multi-event competition, clearing 1.99 m.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, Hellebaut reached her pinnacle thus far by winning the gold medal in the high jump, ahead of the favorite, Blanka Vlašić of Croatia, with a new outdoor personal best of 2.05 m. Her achievement represented the first-ever athletics gold medal in the Olympics for a Belgian woman, and only the second of any color, one day after Belgium won their first (silver) medal in the 4 x 100 m relay.
Retirement and comebacks.
On 5 December 2008 Hellebaut announced her pregnancy and retirement from professional athletics and that she would start working for a sports marketing company. The following year, on 9 June, her daughter Lotte was born.
Inspired by fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters' comeback to the WTA as a young mother, she unexpectedly announced her return to athletics on 16 February 2010, her 32nd birthday. Hellebaut also announced that she would be concentrating exclusively on the high jump and aimed to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics.
Shortly after placing fifth at the 2010 European Athletic Championships in Barcelona by clearing 1.97 metres, her first major championships after her comeback, it was reported that Hellebaut was pregnant again. During a press conference on 17 August she confirmed that she had been pregnant for three months already, and that this had been a conscious choice. Although Hellebaut did not participate in any further 2010 events, she never officially announced that the new pregnancy would definitively end her career.
On 16 June 2011, 4 months after the birth of her second daughter Saartje, Hellebaut announced her second return, confirming that she aimed to defend her title at the London Games. She was the flag bearer of Belgium during the 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. She ended fifth in the high jump competition.
On 6 March 2013, after the European Indoor Championships in Goteborg, she announced her second retirement, saying that she could no longer challenge herself mentally in competition.

Luster (film)

Luster is a 2002 drama film written and directed by Everett Lewis. The film is about a weekend in the lives of a group of friends in the Los Angeles queer punk scene. Lewis sought to "infuse queerness" into the film as much as he could, so he cast a number of non-heterosexual actors and used music by a number of queer punk bands. Critical response to "Luster" was deeply divided.
Plot.
"Luster" takes place over a weekend in Los Angeles.
Friday.
Jackson wakes up in the aftermath of an orgy and heads to his job at his friend Sam's alternative record store. At the store he gets a call from Sonny Spike. On his way out the door, Jackson runs into customer Derek, who professes his love at first sight.
Jackson meets Sonny at his hotel and Sonny asks him to write the lyrics for Sonny's next album. Stoked, Jackson stops back at his house where he finds his cousin Jed in the shower, which immediately inspires thoughts of incest. Jackson and Jed head back to the store, just in time to head out to a book signing by Kurt Domain with Sam (who, sadly, leaves friend Alyssa behind).
At the book signing, Jackson runs into Billy, who he'd met at last night's orgy. Jackson professes "his" love at first sight for Billy, who agrees to have coffee but flatly informs Jackson he won't have sex with him. The author spots Jed, and, taking him as his muse, writes a piece on Jed's body.
Saturday morning.
Jackson, inspired by Jed, writes several poems. Meanwhile, Jed is in the desert, serving as muse to yet a third artist, Alyssa. A bloodied Billy calls Jackson at the record store. Jackson picks him up and takes him home. Billy explains that his ex-lover sexually tortured him.
Leaving Billy to sleep, Jackson gives his poems to Sonny, who thinks they're great but changes the sex of the subjects to female. Jed returns to Jackson's place and crawls into bed next to Billy. Jackson goes back to work, where Derek is waiting for him. Derek again professes his love. Jackson explains he doesn't feel the same but they kiss anyway. Jackson drives Derek home.
Alyssa takes her photos of Jed to a gallery and lands a showing in New York City.
Billy wakes up next to Jed and engages in some sexual torture of his own. Sonny decides he must meet Jackson's inspiration and sends a private investigator to get him. The P.I. finds Billy and brings him to Sonny. It was Sonny who had tortured Billy previously. Billy tells Sonny that he tortured someone that morning and realized that he hated it and that he wants to enslave himself to Sonny.
Sam visits his mother and surprises her with the news that he's paid off her mortgage.
Jackson returns home and finds Jed handcuffed in the shower.
Saturday night.
Sam, Jackson and Jed go on a bar crawl through the city. Jackson runs into Sonny and Billy in the restroom of one bar and beats Billy up for what he did to Jed. Sonny gets turned on by it. When Jackson leaves the bar, Sam and Jed are arguing over Sam's unrequited love for someone. Sam drops Jackson and Jed off at Jackson's and gives Jed a videotape to give to Jackson. Jed goes inside and he and Jackson make love.
Sunday morning.
Jackson takes Jed to the airport for his flight back to Iowa. Jed tells him about the tape. Jackson returns home to find Alyssa and her girlfriend Sandra, who tell him that Sam has killed himself. On the tape, Sam says he's in love with Jackson. He knows he'll never be able to be with Jackson the way he wants to and that he has a lot of pain because of that. Distraught, Jackson runs all the way to Derek's place before the tape even ends. He has Derek reassure him that Derek loves him. Jackson strips naked and tells Derek "I'm all yours." Jackson says he doesn't know if he loves Derek but he does think Derek's pretty special, and special is "pretty fuckin' good."
Critical response.
Critical reaction to "Luster" was sharply divided. "TV Guide", while calling the film "refreshing" for its presentation of "even slightly edgy images of gay life that have nothing to do with "Will & Grace" or "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" nonetheless criticized the film for being "overloaded with too many extraneous characters" and for the Billy/Sonny subplot, calling it "more disturbing than warranted." The "New York Times" dismissed the film as "relentlessly bright and superficial, even when the subject turns to self-destruction. It's as if the filmmaker, along with most of his characters, had taken too many self-esteem seminars at the local Learning Exchange." The "Hollywood Reporter" concurred, calling "Luster" "oughly made and unevenly acted" with little in the way of storyline. "The lack of a meaningful story would be easier to take if the dialogue was wittier or the characterizations were deeper, but the proceedings are instead surprisingly bland considering the outrageousness of many of the situations."
Conversely, the "Los Angeles Times" said that "Luster" "lives up to its title as a fresh, bittersweet look at the pursuit of love..." populated by "attractive, appealing people." The reviewer further states "Luster" has a "charming, skittish quality, and Lewis finds pathos and humor in his characters' often painful search for love. There are moments in which the actors seem a bit self-conscious, yet this low-budget picture is a calling card for pretty much everyone in front of the camera." Although less effusive than the "Times", the "Village Voice" approved of Lewis' direction, saying he "nailed the milieu," and complimented the film as an "endearingly saccharine queer melodrama." "Variety" echoed these sentiments, citing the film's sharp pace, "colorful yet realistic" design and good performances in declaring that Lewis "juggles a quite ambitious mix of tonal, character and narrative left-turns here, and it's much to his credit that the results -- while somewhat uneven -- really do pull together as "Luster" proceeds."
Production and artistic intent.
Director Everett Lewis wanted to "infuse queerness" as deeply as possible into "Luster". To that end, he populated his cast with a number of LGBT actors and filled the soundtrack with music from LGBT punk and queercore bands, most notably Pansy Division. Lewis used the poetry of gay writer Dennis Cooper (including the first poem Cooper ever wrote, about David Cassidy) as Jackson's poetry. Jackson reads the final poem in voice-over over a solid blue screen, a reference and tribute to Derek Jarman's final film, "Blue".
Home media.
"Luster" was released on Region 1 DVD on December 9, 2003. The DVD includes a commentary track by Lewis and producer Robert Shulevitz and a featurette interview with Lewis entitled "Lewis on Film".

Molly Lansing

Molly Lansing-Davis is a fictional character of ABC's "General Hospital". The role is currently portrayed by Haley Pullos. Molly is the daughter of Ric Lansing and Alexis Davis. She was born on-screen on November 10, 2005. In 2009, Molly's birth year is changed to 1998. In 2012, Molly states that she is 15, effectively making her birth year 1997.
Her main storylines include her battle with post traumatic stress disorder after being involved in a tragic bus accident and her romantic relationship with T.J. Ashford (Tequan Richmond).
Storylines.
2005–08.
Molly is the youngest half-sister of Sam Morgan and Kristina Davis; all three share the same mother. She is also the niece of mob boss Sonny Corinthos, which makes her both half-sister and first cousin to Kristina, as well as the youngest granddaughter of Mikkos Cassadine and the step-granddaughter of Helena Cassadine.
On November 10, 2005 Molly was born on-screen in the Glencoe tunnel with the help of Dr. Robin Scorpio, after many of Port Charles' best-known residents were involved in a train crash. Through her mother she is descended from Russian royalty, although this is only alluded to. Following her parents' divorce Ric won primary custody of Molly, with Alexis having visitation rights (although Ric and Alexis later agreed to joint custody). When Ric unexpectedly moved to Los Angeles in June 2009, Molly remained in Port Charles with Alexis.
2009–11.
A SORASed Molly appeared on July 2, 2009, and was shown to be good friends with her similarly SORASed cousin Morgan Corinthos. She was precocious (often speaking to adults on their level) and romantic, often arranging evenings for Jason Morgan and Sam, and Alexis and Mac Scorpio. She was an excellent scholar with a good pitching arm, a combination she used during a September carnival to cause all the "Dunk-a-Hunks" to fall into the water. In late October, when she and Morgan were collecting water samples for her science project, they heard someone shouting for help in a warehouse on the docks. They cooked up a rescue plan and freed Johnny Zacchara from thugs who kidnapped him. Molly was upset when her sister Kristina was attacked twice by Kiefer Bauer, and when Kristina's brother Michael was sent to jail for killing his stepmother because Molly framed him and she was responsible for framing her cousin because her mother Alexis said framing Michael is not the part of a family life because Michael is Alexis' aunt. She could not understand when she discovered Michael's father Sonny dating Claire Walsh, who prosecuted Michael during the trial. When Kiefer was accidentally killed by Alexis, his father Warren vowed revenge on Alexis and Kristina. In response a frightened Molly asked Jason to "make Mr. Bauer disappear," but Jason was unable to.
Molly, Morgan, Michael and Kristina were involved in the ski-resort bus crash during late December 2010 and early January 2011. Everyone was found, and she helped her cousin Michael by alerting the occupants of a car where they were. Shortly afterward Molly began to behave strangely, lashing out in anger for little reason. She began to research bipolar disorder, possibly thinking she suffers from it. She became convinced by a new friend, Shawn Butler who shot Jerry Jacks, (a war veteran) that she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the bus crash, and began receiving therapy.
After overhearing Theo Hoffman's telephone conversation at her mother's law firm, Molly discovered that he was the Balkan (an international crime lord who was after Brenda Barrett). She told Jason and Sam about her findings but was convinced not to tell anyone by the two, who reassured her that they will stop Theo before anything happens. However, when Brenda was apparently killed by a car bomb after her wedding to Sonny Molly blamed herself for not telling anyone (revealing to all that Theo is the Balkan).
When Michael and Morgan's mother, Carly, was divorcing Molly's godfather, Jasper Jacks, they got into a bitter custody battle over their daughter, and Morgan's sister, Josslyn Jacks. Morgan and Molly "kidnapped" Josslyn, keeping her in a barn until Jax promised not to take Josslyn away from Carly. Their plan failed when Kristina found them.
2012—.
Molly is now in high school, and focused on her studies. She starts tutoring T.J. Ashford, Shawn's legal ward who recently arrived. T.J. hosts an unsupervised party at Molly's house to help her make friends, but it gets out of control, and Michael has to come and get everyone to leave. Alexis shows up, and angrily forbids Molly from seeing T.J. again. Molly goes behind her back for months, starting to date T.J., until Alexis catches both of them. She later agrees to let Molly & T.J. date with some restrictions, which they agree to. Molly finds out she's going to be an aunt when Sam reveals she's pregnant. Later, Sam reveals that Jason, her husband, is not the father because she was raped by his twin brother, Franco. Sam's baby dies, and Molly comforts her. Sam later finds out her son was switched with a stillborn baby, and Molly is ecstatic to meet her nephew, Daniel Edward Morgan. Danny is later proven to be Jason's biological son, but Jason is later presumed dead, and Molly is sad for her sister's loss.
Molly starts spending time with Danny, babysitting him for Sam. She runs into Rafe Kovich, Jr. while babysitting Danny, and buys him a bowl of chili. He's arrested for the murder of his mother, Alison Barrington, but Molly believes Rafe's innocence. When Rafe escapes police custody, she hides him in her room. But when she leaves Danny with him, Danny is kidnapped by Heather Webber, and Rafe is exposed. Alexis refuses to let him stay and wants to turn him in, but Molly won't let her. Rafe, though, lets Alexis turn him in so Molly won't get in trouble. When Sam and Danny go missing, Molly helps Rafe and Sam's friend, John McBain, break out of lockup to go find them, after Lucy provides a distraction. Molly is arrested for this because she committed crimes just like her uncle Sonny, not even Delores Padilla could get after her, but later released after John, Rafe, and Lucy rescue Sam & Danny, and reveal the real killer, Stephen Clay. Connie eventually reveals Molly as the true author of the book, giving Molly the writers' credit she wanted.
Rafe admits to Molly that he's in love with her, and kisses her. Molly says she only considers him a friend, and tells T.J. what happened. T.J. ends up punching Rafe, and when Molly finds out, she breaks up with him. However, she changes her mind and tries to reconcile, only to find out T.J. has decided to go to prom with Molly's rival Taylor DuBois who became friends with Britt Westbourne. Molly attends the prom with Rafe, which ends up being cancelled, though they walk around the park together. Molly later finds out T.J. and Taylor had sex that night, but she later forgives him. Taylor now wants T.J., and Rafe is still attracted to Molly. They plan to make them jealous by announcing they're dating, though Molly and T.J. later figure out their schemes. This doesn't stop Rafe, as he tries to get T.J. into trouble. During Valentine's Day, T.J. talks to Molly about taking the next step, and she says she's not ready. When they decide to plan a romantic night together, Rafe tells Alexis, who barges in to their hotel room and drags Molly out. Molly is furious with both Alexis and Rafe, then surprised when Ric shows up in town. Ric insists he's changed, and he wants to be a father to Molly. Molly decides to move in with Ric, still angry at Alexis. However, Alexis apologizes to her, and Molly decides to stay. She also decides to give Ric a second chance to be her father.
Ric is arrested soon after for being the alleged boss of Julian Jerome, Sam's long-lost father and Sonny's enemy and under the alias Cesar Faison. Molly does not believe her dad is capable of this, and vows to prove his innocence. However, Ric is soon killed in a scuffle with the police, and Molly is devastated. Molly blames Julian for her father's death, and is angry that Alexis is still dating him. Upset and hurt, Molly moves out of Alexis' house and moves in with Sam. Not even her cousins Michael and Morgan could stop her because they were too busy at the moment after Robin left with Spencer Cassadine's great-great uncle Victor to revive Helena and Stavros.
General Hospital: Night Shift.
Molly is at Alexis Davis' house with her cousins Michael and Morgan before Faison's return. When her uncle Sonny dropped off his sons Michael and Morgan to Alexis' house, Molly gets to talk to Michael and Morgan because they can always stay all night at her house anytime they want.

List of High Commissioners of New Zealand to the United Kingdom

The High Commissioner from New Zealand to the United Kingdom is New Zealand's foremost diplomatic representative in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and in charge of New Zealand's diplomatic mission in the United Kingdom.
The High Commission is located in London, the United Kingdom's capital city. New Zealand has maintained a resident High Commissioner in the United Kingdom since 1905, and a resident Agent-General since 1871. The High Commissioner to the United Kingdom is concurrently accredited to the Republic of Ireland and Nigeria.
As New Zealand was created as a part of the British Empire, its diplomatic relationship with the United Kingdom is its longest-standing; the position of High Commissioner in London pre-dates New Zealand's dominion status by two years, the Balfour Declaration of 1926 by 21 years, and the adoption of the Statute of Westminster of 1931 by 42 years. New Zealand appointed a High Commissioner to Canada in 1942, and a High Commissioner to Australia in 1943.
As fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations, diplomatic relations between New Zealand and the United Kingdom are at governmental level, rather than between Heads of State, with member countries exchanging High Commissioners, rather than ambassadors.

Cyathea geluensis

Cyathea geluensis is a species of tree fern native to central and eastern New Guinea as well as the Louisiade Archipelago, where it grows in mossy forest. In New Guinea itself, plants grow at an altitude of 1000-2000 m, however they are present at lower elevations of 700-900 m on associated islands. The trunk of this tree fern is erect and may be 5 m tall or more. Fronds are bi- or tripinnate and 1-2.5 m long. They are usually about ten live fronds present in the crown at once. The stipe may be warty and/or have short spines as well as many scattered scales towards the base. These scales are pale to dark and have dull, fragile edges. Sori occur near the fertile pinnule midvein and are protected by pale, thin indusia. "C. geluensis" is a variable taxon and further study is needed to determine whether it does not in fact represent a species complex.
Large and Braggins (2004) note that the specific epithet "geluensis" probably refers to the island of Jalun or Gelun.

Team Role Inventories

The Belbin Team Inventory is a personality test, also called the Belbin Self-Perception Inventory, Belbin Team Role Inventory, SPI or BTRSPI. It was devised by Meredith Belbin to measure preference for nine Team Roles; he had identified those whilst studying numerous teams at Henley Management College. 
The Inventory assesses how an individual behaves in a team environment. The assessment includes 360-degree feedback from observers as well as the individual's own evaluation of their behaviour, and contrasts how they see their behaviour with how their colleagues do.
Belbin himself asserts that the team roles are not equivalent to personality types, and that unlike the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is a psychometric instrument used to sort people into one of 16 personality types, the Belbin Inventory scores people on how strongly they express behavioural traits from nine different team roles. A person may and often does exhibit strong tendencies towards multiple roles.
History.
Belbin first began studying teams at Henley Management College in the 1970s. Over a period of ten years, he carried out extended observational research to determine which factors influenced team failure or success. A management game was designed to reproduce work life. It contained all the principal variables that typify the problems of decision-making in a business environment. The experiment was designed along scientific lines with careful measurement at each stage.
Those participating were invited to take a battery of psychometric tests and teams were assembled on the basis of test scores. At first, Belbin hypothesised that high-intellect teams would succeed where lower intellect teams would not. However, the outcome of this research was that certain teams, predicted to be excellent based on intellect, failed to fulfil their potential. In fact, it became apparent by looking at the various combinations that it was not intellect, but balance, which enabled a team to succeed. The most successful companies tended to be those with a mix of different people, i.e. those with a range of different behaviours. In fact, nine distinct clusters of behaviour turned out to be distinctive and useful, with the balance required dependent on the purpose and objectives of the team.
Application and use.
The Belbin Team Inventory first appeared in Belbin's book "Management Teams: Why They Succeed or Fail" (1981).
The inventory is protected by Belbin's copyright and cannot be reproduced in any form. Additionally, it is not normed, lacks the "Specialist" role and the benefit of feedback from colleagues, and does not offer team role feedback. Much early research is based upon this now obsolete version of the inventory. 
In the initial research, eight team-role behavioural styles were identified -- "Chairman, Shaper, Plant, Monitor-Evaluator, Company Worker, Resource Investigator, Team Worker", and "Completer-Finisher". The current schema has been refined to include a ninth style -- "Specialist" -- and in addition has renamed the Chairman behavioural style "Co-ordinator" and the Company Worker style "Implementer" (probably more for reasons of 'political correctness' rather than any identified changes in behaviour of people in these classifications).
Belbin now administers the refined Belbin Team Inventory via e-interplace, a computerised system which scores and norms the data to produce feedback reports for individuals, teams, groups and jobs. Meredith Belbin argues that the optimum size for a team is 4 people. Beyond this number, individuals do not work closely enough together to constitute a team and are defined as a group.
Data from the Belbin Team Inventory can also be amalgamated and interpreted to assess how effectively a team is likely to work together, including selecting the best candidate to fulfil each role, and identifying gaps and overlaps in the Team Role distribution which might have an impact on a team's success. The Belbin Team Inventory can also be used in conjunction with the Belbin Job Requirements Inventory to assess a candidate's behavioural performance in a particular job.
Belbin Team roles.
Plant.
Plants are creative, unorthodox and generators of ideas. If an innovative solution to a problem is needed, a Plant is a good person to ask. A good Plant will be bright and free-thinking. Plants can tend to ignore incidentals and refrain from getting bogged down in detail. The Plant bears a strong resemblance to the popular caricature of the absent-minded professor/inventor, and often has a hard time communicating ideas to others. Multiple Plants in a team can lead to misunderstandings, as many ideas are generated without sufficient discernment or the impetus to follow the ideas through to action. Plants can also create problems with the timing of their ideas. The fact that the team has decided on a valid way forward and is now in the implementation stage will not stop the Plant from coming up with new solutions and disrupting the implementation process.
Resource Investigator.
The Resource Investigator gives a team a rush of enthusiasm at the start of the project by vigorously pursuing contacts and opportunities. He or she is focused outside the team, and has a finger firmly on the pulse of the outside world. Where a Plant creates new ideas, a Resource Investigator will quite happily appropriate them from other companies or people. A good Resource Investigator is a maker of possibilities and an excellent networker, but has a tendency to lose momentum towards the end of a project and to forget small details.
Co-ordinator.
A co-ordinator is a likely candidate for the chairperson of a team, since they have a talent for stepping back to see the big picture. Co-ordinators are confident, stable and mature and because they recognise abilities in others, they are very good at delegating tasks to the right person for the job. The co-ordinator clarifies decisions, helping everyone else focus on their tasks. Co-ordinators are sometimes perceived to be manipulative and will tend to delegate all work, leaving nothing but the delegating for them to do.
Shaper.
The Shaper is a task-focused individual who pursues objectives with vigour and who is driven by tremendous energy and the need to achieve - for the Shaper, winning is the name of the game. The Shaper provides the necessary drive to ensure that the team is kept moving and does not lose focus or momentum. 
Shapers are people who challenge the team to improve. They are dynamic and usually extroverted people who enjoy stimulating others, questioning norms, and finding the best approaches for solving problems. The Shaper is the one who shakes things up to make sure that all possibilities are considered and that the team does not become complacent. Shapers could risk becoming aggressive and bad-humoured in their attempts to get things done. Shapers often see obstacles as exciting challenges and they tend to have the courage to push on when others feel like quitting.
Monitor Evaluator.
Monitor Evaluators are fair and logical observers and judges of what is going on in the team. Since they are good at detaching themselves from bias, they are often the ones to see all available options with the greatest clarity and impartiality. They take a broad view when problem-solving, and by moving slowly and analytically, will almost always come to the right decision. However, they can become very critical, damping enthusiasm for anything without logical grounds, and they have a hard time inspiring themselves or others to be passionate about their work.
Teamworker.
A Teamworker is the oil between the cogs that keeps the machine that is the team running smoothly. They are good listeners and diplomats, talented at smoothing over conflicts and helping parties understand one another without becoming confrontational. Since the role can be a low-profile one, the beneficial effect of a Teamworker can go unnoticed and unappreciated until they are absent, when the team begins to argue, and small but important things cease to happen. Because of an unwillingness to take sides, a Teamworker may not be able to take decisive action when it's needed.
Implementer.
The Implementer takes their colleagues' suggestions and ideas and turns them into positive action. They are efficient and self-disciplined, and can always be relied on to deliver on time. They are motivated by their loyalty to the team or company, which means that they will often take on jobs everyone else avoids or dislikes. However, they may be seen as closed-minded and inflexible since they will often have difficulty deviating from their own well-thought-out plans, especially if such a deviation compromises efficiency or threatens well-established practices.
Finisher.
The Finisher is a perfectionist and will often go the extra mile to make sure everything is "just right," and the things he or she delivers can be trusted to have been double-checked and then checked again. The Completer Finisher has a strong inward sense of the need for accuracy, and sets his or her own high standards rather than working on the encouragement of others. They may frustrate their teammates by worrying excessively about minor details and by refusing to delegate tasks that they do not trust anyone else to perform.
Specialist.
Specialists are passionate about learning in their own particular field. As a result, they are likely to be a fountain of knowledge and will enjoy imparting this knowledge to others. They also strive to improve and build upon their expertise. If there is anything they do not know the answer to, they will happily go and find out. Specialists bring a high level of concentration, ability, and skill in their discipline to the team, but can only contribute on that specialism and will tend to be uninterested in anything which lies outside its narrow confines.
The Belbin Team Inventory was revised to include the Specialist role, since the role was not revealed in the original research because no specialised knowledge was required for the simulation exercise.
Validity and reliability.
Following the introduction of Belbin's approach to Team Role analysis in 1981, an independent study of the psychometric properties of the instruments was published in 1993 in the Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology. Belbin took to task the authors, Furnham, Steele & Pendleton and the Journal provided Furnham space to reply. Belbin argued that the instruments were not intended for scholarly inquiry, but to inform management consulting practices. Additionally, Belbin maintains that the Belbin Team Inventory is not a psychometric instrument and hence applying tests for psychometric properties are irrelevant.
There have been several other scholarly studies of the validity and reliability of Belbin's approach over the nearly 15 years since the Furnham-Belbin exchange, most of which have used the inventory in its original form.
Fisher, Hunter & MacRosson (2001, June) argue that Furnham's approach (also discussed in Fisher, Macrosson & Sharp (1996)) has fundamental problems in the definitions of several of the 8 roles (see also Broucek & Randall (1996) for a more detailed treatment of this problem). Both the Fisher, et al. (2001) and the earlier Broucek & Randall (1996) find that observational and factor analytical approaches yield 5 rather than 8 role constructs. Fisher, et al. go on to argue that this coherence of the 5 traits of teams is backed up by earlier research by Barrick & Mount (1991).
The original research into the Belbin Team Roles was conducted with the old, copyright, 8-role version that was intended for an individual's own interest rather than for use as a tool. More recent studies using normed data from Belbin's e-interplace system, such as that by Aritzeta, Swailes and Senior (2004) have found higher correlations and reliability, as well as distinct analytical constructs using the online, normed, 9-role tool with observers added to give 360-degree feedback (enhancing construct validity by providing "real-world" data). Swailes and McIntyre-Bhatty also argued (2000 & 2001) that traditional attempts to measure reliability have been misapplied when it comes to the Belbin Team Role Inventory because it is neither ipsative nor non-ipsative, and an equation that took this anomaly into account gave higher estimates of reliability and validity.
Educational applications.
The Belbin Team Inventory is being used in educational settings, including higher education. Smith, Polglase & Parry (2012) applied the Belbin team role self and observer perceptions to a large cohort (145) of undergraduate students in a module assessed through two separate group projects. Students self-selected groups for the first project; for the second, groups were more ‘balanced.’ Results showed a slight improvement in group performance compared with that of previous cohorts, with a significant increase in first-class grades. No evidence was found linking group balance to performance; however, students recognized the value of their Belbin report when entering the job market. Belbin usefully contextualizes regularly occurring group work issues and provides students with ways of managing these issues.
Other team role inventories.
Team Management System (TMS).
A competitor to the Belbin system, developed independently in Australia by Charles Margerison and Dick McCann, is the Margerison–McCann Team Management System. This can be shown as a similar wheel with rather similar roles, whose titles however are different. The company states: "Independent British Psychological Society reviews available on each Profile"
Star Roles Model.
The Star Roles Model is used by organisations to describe the positions managers and mentors adopt when guiding direct-reports and mentees. The concept builds on the Group Roles model developed by Benne & Sheats in 1948, taking a short-cut route to describing preferences when guiding others. Similarly, the Roles Model follows the Mintzberg 10 management positions – drawing in the most relevant elements when considering the mentoring relationship in detail.

Francis Judd Cooke

Francis Judd Cooke (December 28, 1910– May 18, 1995) was an American composer, organist, cellist, pianist, conductor, choir director, and professor.
Life.
Cooke was born December 28, 1910 in Honolulu, Hawaii, to a family of New England missionaries turned cattle ranchers. He was the great grandson of Gerrit P. Judd, the first doctor to reside in Hawaii, and grandson of Albert Francis Judd, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Hawaii. His mother was Sophie Boyd Judd, and father was George Paul Cooke, grandson of Amos Starr Cooke and Juliette Montague Cooke, founders of the Royal School of Hawaii.
Cooke began composing at an early age and his first serious pieces date from age 14. He received a B.A. in music from Yale University in 1933, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He then studied for two years with Charles Martin Loeffler in Medfield, Massachusetts. In 1935 he went to Scotland to study with Donald Francis Tovey at the University of Edinburgh, receiving a Mus. Bac. (Bachelor of Music) degree with First Class Honours in 1938. While studying in Scotland he met and married violist May Ludwig. They settled in Lexington, Massachusetts, where they raised six children.
In 1939 Cooke began teaching at the New England Conservatory of Music, at the request of the Conservatory's then-director, Quincy Porter. His notable students there included John Bavicchi, Sarah Caldwell, Héctor Campos-Parsi, Stephen Casale, Robert Ceely, Robert Cogan, Lyle Davidson, Halim El-Dabh, David Epstein, Ercolino Ferretti, William Hibbard, Billy Jim Layton, Ruth Lomon, Kenneth Peacock, Richard Ronsheim, Ernie Stires, Albert Tepper, and Luise Vosgerchian. He retired in 1970.
He also taught at Yale University in 1959-1960 and at Wellesley College from 1973 to 1979.
A prolific composer, Cooke wrote a great number of choral and orchestral works, as well as chamber works. One CD of his music, entitled "The Warsaw Recordings" (which he did not live to hear), has been released.
In 1974 he completed a music textbook entitled "Sixteenth-Century Vocal Polyphony". In the same year he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Music from the New England Conservatory.
Cooke suffered a stroke in 1981, hampering his organ playing and choir directing, and he turned to composing full-time during the last 14 years of his life. On May 18, 1995, at the age of 84, he died in his sleep at his home in Lexington, Massachusetts, where he had lived for 51 years. He had completed that morning a movement for wind quintet ("Dolce assai"), which was performed at his memorial service the following week at Lexington's First Parish Church (Unitarian), where he had served as organist and choirmaster from 1955 to 1981.
Cooke, who greatly enjoyed poetry, used to sum up his own life with a favorite couplet from the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore's "Gitanjali":

<doc id="5885988" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5885988" title="Mountaineering boot">
Mountaineering boot

Mountaineering boots are a type of footwear used in the sport of mountain climbing. They are designed specifically for moving over harsh terrain.
Design.
Not to be confused with hiking boots, mountaineering boots are usually taller, stiffer, and insulated. The boots can be made of leather, plastic, or modern synthetic materials like Kevlar. 
The extra height and stiffness of mountaineering boots helps support the climber in steep terrain where flexible boots could cause unsure footing and possibly result in a fall. This extra stiffness is traditionally achieved through the use of a full steel shank, though some manufacturers have begun to use carbon fiber to create the necessary stiffness. 
Mountaineering boots are typically designed to be used with crampons. To achieve compatibility with crampons, welts are molded into the toe and heel of the boot, providing a platform for the crampon to attach to. The stiffness of the boot enhances the precision of the crampon and allows a climber to pursue steeper and more difficult terrain.
Another important aspect of mountaineering boots is warmth. To prevent frostbite in extreme cold conditions, synthetic insulation is incorporated into the boot. Lighter weight boots are classified as single boots. These single boots are insulated as a single unit with the insulation being permanently attached to the rest of the boot. Double boots, another classification, typically consist of a non-insulated shell with a removable insulated liner. They have either a leather or plastic outer-shell as well as a removable liner. The purpose of a double boot is long term protection from cold weather. If the liner becomes wet, it can be removed from the shell and dried inside a sleeping bag. Since the insulation cannot be removed from single boots, they are not ideally suited for multi-day cold weather excursions.
Other uses.
Mountaineering boots are used for ice climbing, mixed (rock & ice) climbing, and crevasse traverse and rescue. They are not completely stiff like ski boots as they need some degree of flexibility for activities such as hiking and snowshoeing.
The versatility of these boots also makes them popular for other activities. With their durability and extreme-weather adaptability, they are worn by snow-plough drivers, cable car operators, mountain rangers (especially in the winter), rescue paramedics, ski lift operators and snowcat drivers.
Mountaineering boots are generally considered to be too stiff for backpacking on established trails.

Legal Framework Order, 2002

The Legal Framework Order, 2002 was issued by Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf in August 2002. It provided for the general elections of 2002 and the revival of the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan, and added numerous amendments to the Constitution. The following month, the Supreme Court overruled Musharraf, ruling that the amendments would have to be ratified by Parliament in the manner provided in the unamended 1973 Constitution—the amendments would have to be approved by two-thirds of both houses of the bicameral body.
After the October 2002 general elections, although Musharraf's supporters had a majority in Parliament, they did not have the required two-thirds supermajority to ratify the Legal Framework Order. Parliament was effectively deadlocked by strident opposition from Musharraf's opponents for over a year. In December 2003, a faction was persuaded to vote for a compromise amendment bill, the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan. With this amendment, parts of the Legal Framework Order were incorporated into the Constitution.

Toshizō Nishio

Early life and career.
Nishio was born in Tottori Prefecture, and was a graduate of the 14th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1902, and the 22nd class of the Army War College (Japan). He was commissioned a second lieutenant in June 1903 and served during the Russo-Japanese War, seeing combat at the Battle of Sandepu. He was promoted to lieutenant in February 1905, to captain in December 1909, to major in November 1916 and to lieutenant colonel in August 1920.
Nishio was first attached to the 10th Regiment/10th Division from 1921 to 1923; he was promoted to colonel on 6 August 1923. Afterward, he was an instructor at the Army War College until 1925 when he became commanding officer of the 40th Regiment/10th Division. From 1926 to 1929 he was Chief of the 1st Section, Inspectorate General of Military Training. Promoted to major general on 1 August 1929, he was assigned to command the 39th Brigade of the IJA 20th Division, stationed in Korea. From 1930 to 1932 he was Chairman of Military Investigation in the Ministry of War. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 August 1933, becoming the Head of the 4th Bureau of the General Staff in 1934.
China.
On 5 March 1934, Nishio was appointed Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army in Manchukuo, where he oversaw the establishment of the reorganization of the Manchukuo Imperial Army and the pacification of Manchukuo. In March 1936 he became Vice Chief of the General Staff and Acting Head of the General Affairs Bureau, of the General Staff. In early 1937, he briefly commanded the Imperial Guards Division, before being transferred to China at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. 
After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident Nishio was sent to North China, and took command of the Second Army on 26 August 1937. He oversaw the Tianjin–Pukou Railway Operation that took the Japanese to the Yellow River. He was at the Battle of Xuzhou, crossing the Yellow river and overrunning Shandong until 30 April 1938. Shortly after the defeat his army suffered in the Battle of Taierzhuang, he was replaced and returned to Tokyo to be Inspector-General of Military Training. 
Promoted to general on 1 August 1939, Nishio returned to China again to take command of the Thirteenth Army on 12 September for a month and then took command of all the forces in China as Commander in Chief of the China Expeditionary Army on 22 September. He oversaw the Battle of Zaoyang-Yichang and the First Battle of Changsha. His force withstood the Chinese 1939-40 Winter Offensive and rolled back their gains in the spring with many operations including the Battle of Zaoyang-Yichang. His forces were again struck in North China by the Hundred Regiments Offensive, while he continued attacks in the Yangtze valley in the Central Hopei Operation and Western Hopei Operation. On 1 March 1941 he was replaced and returned to Japan to become a member of the Supreme War Council until he retired in 1943.
Return to Japan.
Nishio took up the governorship of the Tokyo Metropolis from 1944 to the end of World War II. Although arrested after World War II by the American occupation authorities as a suspected war criminal, formal charges were never brought to trial and he was later released.

Cue light

A cue light is a system of one or more electric light bulbs (usually traffic light colors) used to allow silent cues to be given to technicians and performers at various working locations during the running of a show. Typically, the Deputy Stage Manager (UK) or Stage Manager (US) sends signals to these cue lights at pre-arranged times. Sometimes these systems have an "Acknowledge" button that allows feedback on the status of the person at the cue point to the Cue Light Operator. Although headset systems have made cue lights less popular, they are still used in some cases where silence is necessary, or where a headset is not practical.
There are multiple protocols that are used to designate what each light means.
Green is usually used to signal a "go" cue. 
An optional yellow light or a flashing red generally means "stand by." 
A solid red light can indicate that the standby has been acknowledged, or that no cue is pending, depending upon the protocol used.
No light at all can represent that no cue is pending.
An alternate scheme with only one lamp uses "on" as a standby cue and "off" as the cue.
Many sound operators prefer cue lights to headsets so that they can hear the house sound accurately. Alternately, they will use a headset with a call light, rather than continually wearing it.

The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)

"The Runaway Bride" is a special episode of the long-running British science fiction television programme "Doctor Who", starring David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was produced for Christmas 2006, broadcast on 25 December, and played much the same role that "The Christmas Invasion" played the previous year, introducing the third series while not actually being part of it. It features Catherine Tate as Donna, who appeared in the TARDIS at the end of the previous episode, "Doomsday".
Plot.
Synopsis.
The episode opens immediately following the events of "Doomsday". The Doctor, still upset at the loss of Rose Tyler, is shocked to find a woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room. The woman angrily accuses him of abducting her from her wedding and demands to be returned. She angrily rips open the TARDIS doors, to see that she's actually in outer space. She tells the Doctor her name is Donna, and he does several tests to find out how she got into the TARDIS in-flight. The Doctor returns her to Earth, where she storms off to find a cab to return to her wedding. The Doctor is accosted by robotic Santas, and uses the TARDIS to fly alongside the taxi Donna is in to rescue her from the Santa that's driving it. The flight overloads the TARDIS, and the Doctor is forced to set it down on a nearby rooftop. The Doctor gives Donna a ring that will mask her from the Santas, and escorts her back to her wedding.
The Doctor meets Donna's groom, Lance Bennett, whom she had met and fallen in love with while working with him. He reviews the video footage of Donna's disappearance from the wedding and recognizes that she managed to absorb a great deal of huon particles, which would have drawn her to the huon particles contained in the TARDIS. The Doctor realises that the ring he gave Donna cannot mask the huon particle signature, and soon the reception hall is attacked by more Santas. The Doctor is able to use the music sound system to disrupt the attack and trace the control signal to a ship in orbit around Earth, but he quickly loses track of it.
The Doctor learns that Donna's workplace is owned by the Torchwood Institute, which the Doctor believed to be defunct. The Doctor asks Lance to take him to the company headquarters and they are accompanied by Donna. The Doctor discovers a secret basement leading to a long tunnel under the Thames Barrier. There they find machinery creating huon particles, and a pit that seems to lead straight to the core of the Earth. They are surprised by the sudden appearance of the Empress of the Racnoss, a spider-like species wiped out eons ago by the Time Lords. She shows them that she has taken control of the company and used the Torchwood technology to create the pit. Lance reveals that he has been working with the Empress, and was responsible for dosing Donna's coffee with huon particles to convert Donna into a key that would free the Empress' children. The Doctor and a heartbroken Donna escape, and the Empress decides to use Lance as the key and orders him force fed large quantities of the huon particles.
The Doctor retrieves the TARDIS and takes Donna back to the formation of planet Earth. They observe that a Racnoss ship formed the core of the developing planet, and the Doctor deduces that the Empress is attempting to revive her species by using the huon particles to awaken the ancient Racnoss. Back in the present, the Doctor and Donna return to the pit to face the Empress. Donna is captured and put in webbing, and the Doctor is held at gunpoint by the Santas. As the Racnoss are awakened and begin ascending from the pit, the Empress brings her ship closer to Earth and begins firing upon the populace. The Doctor offers to take the Empress and her kind to a planet where they will not harm anyone but she refuses. The Doctor then reveals himself to her as a Time Lord, and tells her he cannot let the Racnoss survive. Using explosives, the Doctor destroys one of the walls of the room, flooding it and the pit with water from the River Thames and killing the Empress's offspring. The Empress teleports back to her ship but it is destroyed by human forces said to be acting upon "Mr. Saxon's" orders.
The Doctor returns Donna home where she declines an offer to travel with him. Donna tells the Doctor not to travel alone, and suggests he needs someone with him to stop him, just in case. The episode ends with the TARDIS taking off up into the atmosphere.
Continuity.
The Robotic Santa Clauses and Christmas Trees from "The Christmas Invasion" return in this story. The Doctor refers to the "spaceship hovering over London" as seen in "The Christmas Invasion" (these events given as having taken place the previous year), and to the Battle of Canary Wharf between the Daleks and Cybermen, as seen in "Doomsday". However, Donna had not seen any of these events due to a hangover and a scuba-diving trip in Spain, respectively. The Doctor makes use of the Tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator, last seen generating a force field in "The Parting of the Ways", to shunt the TARDIS to a different location once it lands. It appears to have been integrated into the TARDIS systems, as a portion of it is covered with TARDIS "coral".
After discovering the sub-basement beneath the Thames Barrier, the Doctor sarcastically states that secret bases hidden beneath London's landmarks are unheard of, a reference to the Nestene Consciousness's lair beneath the London Eye in "Rose."
The tank commander who opens fire on the Empress's ship is heard to say that he has orders from "Mr Saxon". The name first appeared in the 2006 series episode "Love & Monsters" as part of a headline on a copy of "The Daily Telegraph" being read by the Abzorbaloff. It also features in the spin-off series "Torchwood", as a poster on the door of the Ritz Ballroom in the episode "Captain Jack Harkness" and features as the main plot arc keyword of the subsequent series of "Doctor Who".
A bus is shown carrying an advertisement for Henrik's department stores (the department store Rose Tyler worked in). The store itself, and an employee holding an advertising banner for it, are featured in the background of the scene where the Doctor uses the cashpoint. When the Doctor asks about Lance, he says, "He's not a bit overweight with a zip round his head, is he?" This is a reference to the Slitheen. At Donna's wedding reception, the Doctor runs past a sign for the "Manchester Suite" - an area of the same name was mentioned as being aboard Platform One in "The End of the World".
Donna suggests that the Doctor not travel alone because he needs someone to stop him. During the events of the specials after series 4, the Doctor loses control of himself. In "The Waters of Mars", he declares himself the Time Lord Victorious and attempts to alter a fixed point in time with results that should have vindicated his actions. Instead of everyone dying to keep history the same, only the one person had to die while the others were able to live and history was not altered in any major way because of it.
In "Turn Left," it's revealed that if Donna hadn't been there with the Doctor, the Racnoss still would have been defeated, but the Doctor wouldn't have left and would have drowned as a result. In that episode, this creates a whole alternate universe where without the Doctor to stop them, the Earth is devastated by the various alien attacks he had stopped with several of his companions dying keeping the planet from complete destruction.
Production.
Russell T Davies had the idea for this episode from the very beginning of his association with the programme, and he planned to air it in Series Two. With the public announcement of two Christmas specials and the private knowledge of Billie Piper leaving at the end of Series Two, Davies decided to elevate this story to the Christmas special, not introducing the new companion immediately, and filling the slot with "Tooth and Claw".
The end of "Doomsday" is featured as part of the pre-title sequence, although the scene was actually refilmed. In his online podcast commentary for the episode, David Tennant explained that this was due to a change in lighting supervisors, and the one hired for this episode liked to light the TARDIS interior differently; the scene therefore had to be refilmed in order to match. The "Doctor Who" logo in the opening credits has been slightly redesigned from the previous one, with more background detail and flare on the "lozenge" that the words "Doctor Who" sit on.
For legal reasons, the production team made obviously fake banknotes for the scene where money comes flying out of a cashpoint. The £10 notes feature the Doctor's face and the phrases "I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of ten satsumas" and "No second chances — I'm that sort of a man". The text is a reference to the Doctor's actions and dialogue near the end of "The Christmas Invasion". There were also £20 notes featuring producer Phil Collinson. These had the phrase "There's no point being grown up if you can't be a little childish sometimes" printed on them, misquoting the line originally spoken by the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker), in "Robot", "There's no point in being grown up if you can't be childish sometimes." All notes and the cash machine were labelled "London Credit Bank". The notes have become collector's items, regularly selling for £50 or more.
Due to her extremely busy schedule, Catherine Tate was unable to be present for the script readthrough. As a favour, her part was read by Sophia Myles, who played Madame de Pompadour in the 2006 series episode "The Girl in the Fireplace". This is the first "Doctor Who" episode to be shot at the new dedicated Upper Boat studios in Pontypridd; the TARDIS set had previously been housed in former warehouse space in Newport. Although the episode was set during Christmas, filming took place in July, where temperatures reached 30C in Cardiff during filming. Night filming of scenes involving gunfire, explosions and a tank disturbed some Cardiff residents, including one American woman returning home from the conflict in Lebanon. These scenes, as well as those on "Oxford Street", were filmed on St. Mary Street outside Howell's Department Store in Cardiff City Centre; Cardiff Castle is visible behind the tank in some shots.
In a podcast commentary for the episode, David Tennant and executive producer Julie Gardner discussed a sequence that was cut from the broadcast. As broadcast, after Donna finds a piece of Rose's clothing and challenges the Doctor about it, he angrily snatches it from her and sets a course for the TARDIS. As originally filmed, the Doctor first opens the TARDIS doors and throws the garment into space. Gardner said it was cut as it was too melodramatic a moment.
The TARDIS chase scene down the A4232 Grangetown Link Road was shown at a Children in Need concert, which featured a live orchestra performing many of the music themes from Doctor Who, including the Dalek music and Rose's theme. The clip was leaked online shortly after the event and the concert and clip were shown earlier before the episode officially aired on Christmas Day on a "Doctor Who Confidential" special at 1:00 p.m.
Cast notes.
Sarah Parish has co-starred with David Tennant in two other BBC One dramas: "Blackpool" (2004) and "Recovery" (2007). Catherine Tate co-starred with Tennant in a sketch for Comic Relief (2007) which made several "Doctor Who" references.
Catherine Tate returned in series 4, reprising her role as Donna Noble as a full-time companion. Jacqueline King and Howard Attfield are introduced in this episode, and were both due to return in "Partners In Crime", the first episode of the 2008 season. Jaqueline King did return but Howard Attfield died shortly after completing the shoot, and his scenes were reshot with Bernard Cribbins as Donna's grandfather. King had previously appeared in the "Doctor Who Unbound" audio drama "Deadline".
Music.
"Merry Xmas Everybody" by Slade appears again, as in the previous year's "The Christmas Invasion".
Also as with "The Christmas Invasion" (which contained the tune "Song for Ten"), composer Murray Gold wrote an original song for this special, called "". The song was performed by Neil Hannon, frontman of the Divine Comedy (who had, coincidentally, appeared in a sketch of "The Catherine Tate Show" earlier in the year). The song was previewed at the "" concert on 19 November 2006 at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff, where it was sung by Gary Williams; the studio version featuring Hannon is on the released on 11 December 2006.
Broadcast and reception.
This was the first "Doctor Who" story to be broadcast with in-vision British Sign Language interpretation, in a UK repeat on 30 December 2006. The final official ratings for "The Runaway Bride" gave it an audience of 9.35 million viewers, making it the tenth most-watched programme on British television during Christmas week.
"The Runaway Bride" was released as an individual episode, along with the "Doctor Who Confidential" special episode "Music and Monsters", on 2 April 2007 as a basic DVD with no additional special features. Although "The Runaway Bride" was not filmed in HD the BBC aired it on BBC One HD Tuesday 28 December 2010. They up-scaled the program to HD and it also included Dolby Surround sound. This is the first "Doctor Who" episode that has been up-scaled in the United Kingdom.
Steve O'Brien of "SFX" gave "The Runaway Bride" four out of five stars, noting that it was different from anything "Doctor Who" had done, but the "sillier" tone worked for Christmas Day. He also praised Tennant and Tate. IGN's Travis Fickett gave the episode a score of 7.2 out of 10, feeling that Donna had improved from her short appearance at the end of "Doomsday". Fickett was also positive to the way Rose was not ignored. Dek Hogan of Digital Spy wrote that the episode "lacked the energy and excitement of last year's effort", particularly criticising the Empress. In 2012, "SFX" listed "The Runaway Bride" as a bad example of a sci-fi Christmas episode, noting that it was "a decent episode in many respects" but had the disadvantage of being filmed in the summer.

North Carolina Highway 211

North Carolina Highway 211 (NC 211) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It traverses mostly through the Sandhills and Coastal Plain regions of the state; connecting the cities of Candor, Aberdeen, Raeford, Lumberton, Bladenboro, and Southport.
Route description.
NC 211 is predominantly a two-lane rural highway that traverses for in a diagonal northwesterly route. Its southern terminus is at US 421, via the Fort Fisher Ferry Terminal, in Fort Fisher. Crossing the Cape Fear River on the Fisher-Southport Ferry, travelers enter the town of Southport; where the highway first goes through the downtown area before begins its northwesterly direction to Supply, where it connects with US 17. 
Now going on an almost due north direction, it passes through the Green Swamp Preserve, reaching the town of Bolton, where it connects with US 74 and US 76. This section of highway may one day be paralleled by a future segment of I-74.
Returning to a north-westerly direction, it goes through Clarkton (connecting with US 701) and makes a bypass north of Bladenboro before reaching the biggest city along its route, Lumberton. In Lumberton, it follows Roberts Avenue, as it bypasses the downtown area; at the north-end of Lumberton, it connects with I-95/US 301. 
North of Red Springs, the highway designations change from north–south to east–west direction; though it continues to go on an almost northerly route through Raeford (connecting with US 401) and Aberdeen (connecting with US 1/US 15/US 501), till it reaches the roundabout, in Pinehurst. After the roundabout, NC 211 goes on a more westerly direction, it traverses through West End and Eagle Springs, before ending at its western terminus in Candor (connecting with I-73/I-74/US 220).
History.
Established in 1921 as an original state highway, traversing from NC 23 (today US 701 Bus), in Clarkton, to NC 20 (today NC 72), in Lumberton. In 1930, it was extended south as a new primary routing to US 17/NC 20 (today NC 214), in Bolton. In 1932, it extended north as a new primary routing to NC 70 (today NC 72), in Red Springs. By 1935, its northern terminus was extended again to Aberdeen, replacing NC 70. In 1940, its third northern extension was made, overlapping with US 15/US 501 through Aberdeen, then replacing NC 2 to its current terminus in Candor.
In the late 1940s, NC 211's route was realigned from Main Street to South Street, in Aberdeen; some of the former routing became part of NC 5. During the early 1950s, NC 211 made a fourth extension north in Candor, replacing US 220 on Pack House Road; this lasted until June, 1963 where it was moved back to its former and current northern terminus.
In the mid-1950s, NC 211 made the following adjustments: at Eagle Springs, it was placed on new construction bypassing north of the community, its old alignment becoming Eagle Springs Road (SR 1138). In Bolton, it was removed from Old 211 (SR 1805) and extended south on new primary routing to US 17/NC 130, in Supply. And in Lumberton, it was moved onto its current alignment on Roberts Avenue, its old alignment becoming NC 211A (later becoming NC 211 Business).
In 1957, NC 211 was extended south, overlapping with NC 130, into Southport (at Moore Street). Between 1958-1962, various alignment changes were made along the route at Antioch and Seven Lakes. Also around 1961, NC 211 was rerouted with US 15/US 501 between Aberdeen and Pinehurst to the roundabout, then onto new primary routing that avoided central Pinehurst; the old alignment became part of NC 5. In 1969, NC 211 was placed on new routing west of the McCain community, leaving Old NC 211 (SR 1318).
In 1972, NC 211 was placed on new alignment north between Butters and Bladenboro, the old alignment became secondary road (SR 1134). In 1975, more of NC 211 was placed on new alignment north and east of Bladenboro, its old alignment through town becoming NC 211 Business (which also incorporated the former section displaced in 1972).
Around 1990, NC 211 was extended to its current southern terminus at the Southport Ferry Terminal, after upgrades were made on Moore Street and Ferry Road. On June 6, 2013, NC 211 was extended east over the Cape Fear River, via the Fort Fisher-Southport Ferry, to Fort Fisher and US 421. Justification for the change was to have the highway end at another primary route and to incorporate the ferry route into a marine highway, which will expedite dredging operations in emergency situations.
Future.
A widening project from the traffic circle in Pinehurst to West End has been planned, which includes curbs, gutters, and sidewalks along the upgraded multi-lane highway. Because of streams and wetlands in the area, NCDOT has to work with the US Army Corps of Engineers, which has delayed the environmental impact study. The estimated cost is $31 million. Property acquisition is expected to start February, 2012.
Bannered routes.
Lumberton alternate spur.
North Carolina Highway 211 Alternate (NC 211A) was established by 1949 as a spur route that connected with US 301 (Pine Street) with mainline NC 211 (Elm Street) along 24th Street. In 1957, the alternate route was decommissioned when NC 211 was bypassed north of Lumberton.
Lumberton alternate route.
North Carolina Highway 211 Alternate (NC 211A) was established by 1957 as a renumbering of mainline NC 211 through downtown Lumberton; via Fifth Street, Second Street, Chestnut Street, and Elm Street. In 1960, it was rebannered as NC 211 Business.
Lumberton business loop.
North Carolina Highway 211 Business (NC 211 Bus) was established in 1960 as a renumbering of NC 211A, which traversed along the old NC 211 route through downtown Lumberton; via Fifth Street, Second Street, Chestnut Street, and Elm Street. On April 1, 1971, the route was decommissioned, reverting all to secondary routes; in 1983, NC 72 was reassigned onto Fifth and Second streets.
Bladenboro business loop.
North Carolina Highway 211 Business (NC 211 Bus) was established in 1975 as a renumbering of mainline NC 211 through downtown Bladenboro, via Martin Luther King Jr Drive and Seaboard Street.

Nice tramway

The Nice tramway is a tram system of 8.7-km rail in Nice, France, currently composed of one line, and operated by the "Société nouvelle des transports de l'agglomération niçoise" division of Veolia Transdev under the name Lignes d'azur. Opened on 24 November 2007, it replaced bus lines 1, 2, 5 and 18. From the start, the system had 20 Alstom Citadis trains in service, providing a frequency of seven minutes. Since its inception, the number of passengers has increased from 70,000 per day in 2008 to 90,000 per day in 2011. The frequency of trams is to gradually increase from seven to five minutes, even four minutes by 2011.
Given the success of the T1 line, mayor of Nice Christian Estrosi decided to create two other lines, which are planned to go into service beginning in 2015. Line 2 is to serve the Nice airport to the west through the construction of a multimodal center and the Port of Nice to the east. Line 3 will cross the valley of the Var. In addition, the Nice Côte d'azur urban region decided to extend line 1 to the Pasteur neighbourhood.
History.
1900-1953.
The first tramway in Nice, the Tramway de Nice et du Littoral, appeared in 1900, and was followed by a departmental network in 1906. The entire network was electrified in 1910. In the 1920s, the network had 11 lines, some of which were partially used for goods transport. However, the tram was criticised and was replaced by buses on some lines beginning in 1927. The last tramway in Nice disappeared on 10 January 1953.
Current tramline.
Like many other French cities, Nice has major traffic problems, including the fact that most economic activities are concentrated in the centre. To overcome these problems, studies on the implementation of transit in dedicated lanes were conducted in 1987. The city of Nice began to implement dedicated bus lanes in 1997, and launched a study on the implementation of a tram line in 1998.
Trams were chosen because they appeared to be more reliable than buses, since they are not subject to the vagaries of traffic, but they are less expensive than a subway line. The tram was declared a public utility in 2003 and work began the same year; the line was placed in service on 24 November 2007 after several weeks of technical trials, even though construction was not fully completed.
In the months following the launch of the tram, there were between 65,000 and 70,000 passengers daily; the number rose to 90,000 by January 2011.
Network.
The Nice tramway was designed to serve most of the population of Nice. As the city is situated on hilly ground by the sea, the line was drawn as a U shape, passing through the city centre.
There is currently only one line, served by two termini: "Henri Sappia" and "Pont Michel". A second line, connecting the city centre with the airport and the Central Business District (CADAM, Arénas), is under construction.
Henri Sappia terminus.
Formerly called "Las Planas", the north-western terminus of the tramway was renamed "Henri Sappia" in July, 2013. The Henri Sappia depot is situated at the northwestern terminus of the line in the neighbourhood of Le Rouret, where the Count of Falicon and the Marquis of Rouret once owned large villas and many farms dotted the land.
Above the tram terminus sport and cultural centres have been built. The plaza in front of the station has been raised and planted, with a fountain of water jets installed.
Fontaine du Temple.
The Fontaine du Temple neighbourhood where the "Comte de Falicon" tram stop is built has been remodelled for the arrival of the tramway. The plaza has been repaved and will host an outdoor market.
Planned extensions.
Line 2 will run for 11.3 km of which 3.2 km near the center are going to be underground. Starting at the port in the east and ending at Nice Côte d'Azur Airport and Nikaïa in the west, serving 20 stations in total. Ridership expectations are 140 000 pessanger per day. Work is to beginn in the second half of 2014. A €270m contract for building the underground section has been awarded in december 2013 with a opening date being envisioned for the end of 2017. The total cost of the line is projected to be €770m of which the central government is contributing €52.8m.
Tram and art.
Art works are used throughout the line, including sculptures of figures by Jaume Plensa, on the top of pylons on the Place Massena. Michel Redolfi designed the sound system. Artists Benjamin Vautier, known as "Ben" (who designed the station name signs), the Mado la Niçoise, Michael Lonsdale and others make voice announcements inside the tram. Sounds and voices are different depending on the hours, seasons, etc. The thirteen artists selected to decorate the tramway are:
Rolling stock.
The cars of the Nice tramway are unique and have been designed to blend in with the "Niçois" architecture. They are based on the Alstom Citadis family of tramcars and were built near La Rochelle, Poitou-Charentes. A standard 5-car tram measures 35 m but extra carriages may be added, bringing the length to 45 m. The tram is 2.65 m wide and can carry 200 passengers at 18 km/h compared to 11 km/h for the bus. It uses the standard gauge.
Power supply.
Nice tramway was originally to use the ground-level power supply third rail system as used by Bordeaux tramway. However, this was abandoned in favour of the more conventional overhead power supply cables providing 750V DC, except where the tram crosses the Place Masséna and Place Garibaldi, when it lowers its pantograph and relies on its onboard nickel metal hydride batteries to cross these large open spaces, where overhead wires would be an eyesore.

Richard Lee McNair

Richard Lee McNair (born December 19, 1958) is a convicted murderer known for his ability to escape and elude capture. In 1987, McNair murdered one man and shot a second man four times during a botched robbery. He is currently serving two terms of life imprisonment for these crimes.
After McNair's arrest, he escaped three times from three different institutions using various creative methods. On his first attempt he used lip balm to squeeze out of a pair of handcuffs. He escaped a second time by crawling through a ventilation duct. In his last escape from a federal prison in April 2006, he mailed himself out of prison in a crate. This resulted in his being featured a dozen times on the TV show "America's Most Wanted", and made him one of the top fifteen fugitives wanted by US Marshals. McNair traveled to Canada twice in order to evade capture, traveling across the country for over a year before being apprehended in a random police check. Much of what the public knows about McNair's escape and his time as a fugitive is through McNair's prison correspondence with a Canadian journalist, Byron Christopher.
Overview.
On November 1987, while attempting a burglary in Minot, North Dakota, McNair was surprised by two men and murdered one of them. McNair's murder of Jerry Thies occurred at a grain elevator operated by the Farmers Union Elevator Co. while McNair was a sergeant posted at the nearby Minot Air Force Base. A second man was shot four times, but survived. When the police called McNair in for questioning, McNair surrendered a concealed handgun. He was later sentenced to two life sentences for murder and attempted murder, and a thirty-year prison sentence for burglary.
McNair's first escape attempt occurred at the Minot municipal police station in 1988, shortly after he had been arrested. McNair's first period as a fugitive lasted only a few hours, after which McNair was quickly recaptured. After his initial arrest, McNair was handcuffed to a chair and left in a room with three detectives. McNair used lip balm, which he had in his pocket, as a lubricant to squeeze his hands free from the handcuffs. McNair then led police on a chase on foot through the town, eventually being chased up a three-flight stairway in an effort to evade capture. After becoming surrounded by police on the roof of a three-story building downtown, McNair attempted to jump to a tree branch to escape arrest, but the branch broke. McNair landed on the ground and hurt his back, after which he was easily apprehended. After McNair was released from the hospital, he was moved to the Ward County Jail in Minot. In February 1988, sheriff's deputies discovered another escape attempt when, after moving McNair to another cell, they found two cinder blocks partially chiseled out from the cell in which he was being held.
In October 1992. McNair escaped with two other prisoners from the North Dakota State Penitentiary in Bismarck, North Dakota by crawling through a ventilation duct. One of the prisoners who escaped with McNair was apprehended within hours, and the other within days. After his escape, McNair grew out his hair and dyed it blonde in an attempt to disguise himself. Much of his time on the run was spent roaming the United States in stolen cars. McNair remained free for ten months, until he was eventually arrested in Grand Island, Nebraska in 1993. After his second recapture, the North Dakota Department of Corrections deemed McNair a problematic inmate, and requested that he be transferred to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. McNair remained in federal custody until his final escape, over a decade later.
Final escape.
First day.
On April 5, 2006, McNair escaped from a United States Penitentiary in Pollock, Louisiana. McNair's duties in prison included work in a manufacturing area, where he would repair old, torn mailbags. He held this position for several months, throughout which McNair plotted his escape. McNair escaped by hiding himself in a specially-constructed "escape pod" (which included a breathing tube), which was buried under a pile of mailbags. The pallet was shrink-wrapped and forklifted to a nearby warehouse outside of the prison fence. After prison staff delivered McNair's pallet and went for lunch, McNair cut himself out of his "escape pod" and walked through the unsecured area to freedom. Federal investigators believed that McNair must have received help from other inmates to escape, but McNair has always maintained that he acted alone.
McNair's pallet was shipped out of the prison around 9:45am, and he was able to exit the pallet around 11:00am. McNair was aware that it would not be until 4:00pm that the prison would find him missing. McNair's plan was to go to the nearby town of Alexandria, Louisiana, where he would then steal supplies and transportation.
Hours after his escape from Pollock, McNair was stopped while jogging on a railroad track near Ball, Louisiana by police officer Carl Bordelon. The location of where he was stopped is 31.409,-92.417. This incident was captured on a video camera mounted in Bordelon's patrol car. McNair had no identification and proceeded to give Officer Bordelon the alias of Robert Jones. When asked again five minutes later, he gave a different alias, Jimmy Jones. Bordelon did not pick up on this. McNair laughed and joked with the officer, and even as the officer got a matching description of the inmate, McNair appeared collected and calm. He successfully convinced Bordelon that he was jogging and in town to help on a post-Katrina roofing project, allowing him to go back to 'jogging' within 10 minutes.
Several factors made it easier for McNair to escape arrest: the photo provided to police was very low-quality and six months old, and the prison had told police that they were not completely sure that McNair had escaped. The extreme heat and humidity (114F/45C with 80% humidity), with the officer's black uniform and body armour, may have affected the officer's concentration. Bordelon himself claimed that he let McNair escape because the physical description of McNair given to police was completely different from how McNair actually appeared. Over the ten minutes that Bordelon questioned McNair, McNair remained cool and provided completely plausible explanations, eventually convincing Bordelon that his alibi was true.
McNair later wrote that he did not see the cruiser because it was blocked from view by trees, and that he planned to run if he was not able to convince Bordelon of his innocence. McNair later refuted the suggestion that he would have assaulted the police officer if confronted, claiming that he had renounced violence after his initial arrest. McNair described his escape as a "get out of jail free card", and described his feelings after the confrontation with Bordelon as "relief, disbelief, bewilderment." McNair agreed that he did not resemble his prison picture.
Fugitive in Canada.
On April 13, 2006, US Marshals added McNair to their 15 Most Wanted list. They noted that McNair was the first prisoner to escape from a federal prison since 1991.
Later that April, about two weeks after his escape, McNair successfully crossed into British Columbia from Blaine, Washington. On April 28, 2006, RCMP in Penticton, British Columbia confronted McNair while investigating a stolen car that he was driving, which was parked at a local beach. The officers asked McNair to step out of the car to be questioned, which he did, but he ran across a nearby field and outran the officers soon after being confronted. The police impounded the car, but did not realize the identity of McNair until two days later, when one of the officers recognized him from an episode of "America's Most Wanted". Subsequent investigation found a digital camera full of self-portraits, which police determined were probably for the purpose of producing a fake ID. When authorities examined the car, they found McNair's fingerprints, confirming that he was in Canada.
After escaping arrest in Penticton, McNair rode a bike to Kelowna. Because it took several days for the police to confirm his identity, it was relatively easy for McNair to escape the area. In May 2006 McNair travelled back to the United States, when he drove a Subaru Outback from Vernon, British Columbia to Blaine, Washington. McNair then traveled across the United States, and eventually crossed back into Canada from Minnesota. After arriving back in Canada, McNair traveled through southern Ontario, then traveled west, to Vancouver.
Early on, McNair developed a plan to buy land in central BC, around Williston Lake, after seeing ads for the property. He changed his mind after visiting the area and finding that a drought and pine beetle infestation had devastated the area. The fact that there was only one road in and out of the property also made McNair feel uncomfortable.
In 2007 McNair travelled to eastern Canada. He drove through the Laurentian Highlands in Quebec, where he enjoyed mountain biking. He spent a lot of time around Lac Saint-Jean. McNair nearly attempted to cross back into the United States again at Derby Line, Vermont, but the high security on the American side convinced him that attempting to cross back would be too risky. He eventually travelled through Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Saint John, New Brunswick. McNair spent about two months in Fredericton, New Brunswick, before he was again confronted by police.
Attempts to avoid recapture.
On April 8, 2006, three days after McNair's escape, "America's Most Wanted" ran its first profile of McNair. The program would go on to detail McNair a total of twelve times on television, and nine times on radio. The last time McNair was featured was November 24, 2007, a month after his recapture. Over the period of McNair's time in Canada, Canadian viewers made over 50 reports to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), confirming that the fugitive had been seen north of the border.
McNair watched "America's Most Wanted" intently, describing the show as a "thorn". McNair confirmed after his capture that, whenever a new episode of "America's Most Wanted" aired, he would buy food and fuel his vehicle, "then if featured would keep it low for a couple of days".
Throughout his time as a fugitive, McNair tracked his own story on the internet. After his recapture, McNair commented that the ongoing coverage of him was "for the most part true". Louisiana Marshal Glenn Belgard attempted to capture McNair online with the help of a criminal profiler. McNair suspected that the Louisiana police had attempted to contact him by posing as a woman online, who said that "she would like to hide in her basement." McNair was surprised by the media coverage that focused on him, especially the eleven-page article that appeared in "The New Yorker", written by Mark Singer, on October 9, 2006.
McNair owned several laptops while living as a fugitive. After having his laptop seized in Penticton, he began to store most of his information on USB sticks. With the help of a scanner, digital camera, PhotoShop, and a pet ID website, McNair was able to produce a passable fake Alaska driver's license. He learned how to rig his video camera to his laptop so that he could cut his own hair. One of McNair's laptops was dedicated solely to monitoring a Louisiana-based website, "www.wesawthat.blogspot.com", which closely followed all media coverage of McNair.
In order to support himself, McNair stole vehicles and cash from car dealerships. Because he had once worked as a car salesman himself, McNair knew where to find cash and keys at such dealerships, and how to avoid security. McNair only stole new vehicles: they had window stickers indicating whether a vehicle was equipped with a GPS-style tracking system (if it did, he wouldn't touch it). McNair avoided driving conspicuous-looking vehicles, preferring white vehicles that "everybody has". He once considered stealing a 3/4 ton truck/camper, “but one of the supposed sightings of was in North Dakota (of all places) in a truck with camper", so he eventually settled on a van instead.
In one incident, while McNair was staying in a motel near Chilliwack, British Columbia, he left to buy something and returned to find the motel surrounded by a police SWAT team. McNair began to flee in his car, but later found on a local AM radio station that the police were responding to a hostage situation at the motel. McNair then returned to the scene and filmed the standoff with a Sony HD video camera which he had recently purchased. The episode lasted for another twenty minutes.
Recapture.
On October 24, 2007 near Nash Creek, New Brunswick, off-duty RCMP constable Dan Melanson spotted an expensive-looking white cube van with "crappy looking" tinted rear windows and an Ontario licence plate. Suspecting that the van was stolen, and/or being used to smuggle alcohol or cigarettes, Melanson noted the plate number and noted that the van was headed to Campbellton, a nearby town. Melanson did not attempt to apprehend McNair, but his report alerted other RCMP in Campbellton of the presence of McNair's vehicle. (McNair had in fact tinted the windows himself in a London, Ontario park).
The next day Constable Stephane Gagnon, a six-week rookie, spotted McNair's van by chance in downtown Campbellton, and pursued it. Following a low-speed car chase and a subsequent foot chase, McNair was successfully arrested by Gagnon with the help of his field coach, Constable Nelson Lévesque. In October 2008 the US-based International Association of Chiefs of Police awarded Melanson the "Looking Beyond the Licence Plate" Grand Prize for his role in apprehending McNair. McNair himself described his capture as simply the product of bad luck: as he put it, it was "just one of those days." McNair was transferred to the Atlantic Institution, a Canadian federal maximum security penitentiary in Renous, New Brunswick, while awaiting extradition to the United States.
Mounties later told the media that McNair was cooperative after his capture, and even joked with them. When one officer asked McNair what the reward was for his capture, McNair replied "$25,000." "That's not much," said the officer. McNair replied that was because "all of the government money is tied up in Osama Bin Laden's reward." McNair later described the Campbellton RCMP as "good men doing their job."
Current housing.
Prison.
McNair (Federal Bureau of Prisons ID # 13829-045) is currently incarcerated at ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. ADX Florence has a reputation as "the Alcatraz of the Rockies". It houses some of the United States' most dangerous prisoners, including those who, like McNair, have been deemed too great a security risk for even a maximum-security prison. When McNair was captured, several law-enforcement sources told "AMW" that he would almost certainly spend the rest of his life at ADX.
McNair now spends most of every day in a 12'x7' concrete cell. He lives in a pod with five other prisoners, whom he cannot see. His only human contact is with the prison guards, with whom he can communicate only through a barrier of steel and bulletproof glass. McNair has no access to the Internet or a telephone, and his only means of communication with the outside world is via mail. Prison staff screen and freely censor McNair's incoming and outgoing mail.
In his media correspondence, McNair described his location as the "most secure section of the most secure prison in the world", but expressed reservations about discussing specific details of his incarceration. "Thank God for prisons", McNair wrote. "There are some very sick people in here... Animals you would never want living near your family or the public in general. I don't know how corrections staff deal with it. They get spit on, shit on, abused and I have seen them risk their own lives and save a prisoner many times."
Media correspondence.
In 2008, Byron Christopher, an award-winning crime reporter from the same New Brunswick town where McNair was captured, began a correspondence with McNair via mail. In his first letter, Christopher included a picture that he had taken of the town, taken near the place that McNair was arrested. He told McNair that he hoped the Campbellton Chamber of Commerce would write a cheque to McNair for all the publicity he had brought to the town, and wrote to McNair about the recent World Series and federal election. Christopher included three American dollars in order to cover the cost of paper and postage. The prison returned his money.
When McNair wrote back to Christopher, it was his first response to the media. The letter revealed many personal details about McNair's most recent escape which had previously been unknown. Revealing that he had spent time hiding in Fredricton, New Brunswick, McNair described Fredricton's residents as "very friendly and well educated." He revealed that his favorite magazine was the Christian Science Monitor. Campbellton's local newspaper, "The Tribune", covered the correspondence in detail.
In subsequent letters to Christopher, McNair revealed details about his escape and travels through Canada, providing most of what the public knows about McNair's time as a fugitive. McNair had an interest in discussing his story with a British TV reporter, but suspects that the correspondence may have been terminated by prison censors. 
Christopher later compiled his correspondence, conducted additional research on the story, and eventually produced a book on McNair, "The Man Who Mailed Himself Out of Jail". It was released via Amazon.com on June 20, 2013. The book is a follow-up to "The Running Man" series, published by "The Tribune" newspaper of Campbellton, New Brunswick, in 2009.

Dietrich Thurau

Dietrich ("Didi") Thurau (born 9 November 1954 in Frankfurt) is a retired German professional road bicycle racer. His biggest career achievements include winning the one-day classic, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, his home country's Deutschland Tour and surprising the field at the 1977 Tour de France by capturing four stages and holding the yellow jersey from the prologue for 15 days. Thurau did win the maillot blanc as best young rider although he lost the overall lead to eventual winner Bernard Thévenet.
Thurau was German pursuit champion three times and won 29 six-day races.
Career.
After his victory in the points classification in the Vuelta a España and a fourth place in the general classification in the Vuelta a España in 1976, Thurau was seen as a talented rider, but not seen as a rider for the general classification. This changed when he won the prologue 1977 Tour de France, won time trials and mountain stages, keeping the lead until far in the race, finishing fifth in the overall classification and won the young rider classification.
Thurau signed a contract to ride the 1978 season as a team leader at Ijsboerke. Before his contract started, but after he signed it, he rode the 1977 UCI Road World Championships. Seven kilometers before the finish, he was away together with Francesco Moser, and Moser punctured. To the surprise of commentators, including the coach of the French team Jacques Anquetil and Thurau's team leader Peter Post, Thurau waited for Moser, and was beaten in the sprint by Moser. This caused rumours that Thurau had sold the championship to Moser; it later became clear that Thurau's new bosses at Ijsboerke did not want Thurau to ride in the rainbow jersey, but wanted him to keep his sponsored jersey.
Thurau's primary goals for the next season became the 1978 Giro d'Italia and the 1978 UCI Road World Championships, and his team skipped the 1978 Tour de France, because they felt there were too many mountain finishes for a rider like Thurau. Although Thurau won two stages in the 1978 Giro, it did not go as expected, as he had to abandon the race in the tenth stage, when he had already given up all hopes for the general classification.
In 1979, Thurau won Liège–Bastogne–Liège, and again came second in the 1979 UCI Road World Championships, but he was no longer seen as able to win a grand tour, and he changed teams. He continued as a professional cyclist for several years, but did not win any major races. 
Doping.
Thurau tested positive for stimulants after Stage 8 of the 1987 Tour de France. He was fined 5,000 FF (£500), incurred a 10 minute time penalty, placed last on the stage and was given a one month suspended ban. However, by the time the positive result was revealed, Thurau had already abandoned the Tour.
After he had retired, in 1989, he gave an interview to the Bild newspaper, in Germany, where he revealed he had doped throughout his career, including the use of Amphetamines, Testosterone and Cortisone.
Personal life.
In 1998, Thurau was fined 20,000 DM for forgery. In 2012, it was reported that he had embezzled 49,000 EUR in insurance benefits, which were meant for his father, Helmut, to pay for his nursing home. Instead, Thurau kept the money. He was convicted of the offence and was fined 39,900 EUR.
His son Björn Thurau is also a racing cyclist, whilst Björn's younger brother Urs is a tennis player who is coached by Dietrich.

Palaeeudyptes klekowskii

Palaeeudyptes klekowskii was a species of the extinct penguin genus "Palaeeudyptes". It was approximately the size of its congener "Palaeeudyptes antarcticus": somewhat larger than the Emperor Penguin. It is known from an extensive collection of fossil bones from the Late Eocene (34-37 MYA) of the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island, Antarctica. "P. klekowskii" was at first not recognized as a distinct species, and despite the coexistence of two so closely related species of similar size as "Palaeeudyptes gunnari" and "P. klekowskii" seeming somewhat improbable, the amount of fossil material suggests that the two species are indeed diagnosably different.

Michael Loam

Michael Loam (1797–1871) was a Cornish engineer who introduced the first man engine (a device to carry men up and down the shaft of a mine) into the UK.
In 1834, concerned for the health of miners and for the loss in profits incurred by their long, slow climbs by ladders, the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society announced a prize for the design of a better system of transporting miners in and out of the deep mines in the county. Michael Loam won this prize in 1841 for his man engine, despite evidence that it was already in use in the Hartz Mountains in Germany.
Inspired by the German designs and constructed of a series of moving platforms, the first man engine was installed in 1842 at Tresavean Mine—one of the deepest in Cornwall at the time. Its adoption was encouraged by the mine's owner, John Rogers.
Loam was trained as an engineer at Wheal Abraham by Arthur Woolf. He remained active in the metal mining and smelting industries in Cornwall and is noted as an investor in the Tamar Tin Smelting Company in 1863.

Thomas Walter Swan (December 20, 1877 – July 13, 1975) was a longtime Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Swan was born and raised in Connecticut, and attended Yale University and Harvard Law School. He then practiced law in Chicago from 1903 to 1916, when he became the Dean and a professor at Yale Law School. In 1926, President Calvin Coolidge nominated Swan to be a Judge of the Second Circuit. (Swan's predecessor in his judgeship, Henry Wade Rogers, had also been Dean of Yale Law School.)
Swan served on the Second Circuit as an active judge until 1953 and was the Chief Judge from 1951 to 1953. Swan was highly regarded as a judge and served on an eminent bench that also included Learned Hand, Augustus Hand, Charles Clark, and Jerome Frank. In 1953, Swan took "senior status" on the court, which he retained until his death in 1975 at the age of 97.

Vahi-vero

In Tuamotu mythology, Vahi-vero is the son of the demigod Kui and a goblin woman named Rima-roa. 
Kui plants food trees and is also a great fisherman. The goblin woman Rima-roa robs his garden; he lies in wait and seizes her and she bears him the son Vahi-vero. 
Vahi-vero visits a pool from which the beautiful Tahiti-tokerau daily emerges. Kui teaches him how to lie in wait and seize her and never let her go until she pronounces his name. Having mastered her, he finds that Puna, king of Vavau, is his rival. He goes by way of the pool to the place where Puna guards the girl in a house with round ends, and brings her back with him, leaving her sister Huarehu in her place. Tahiti-tokerau bears to him the boy Rata. Puna comes in shark form to avenge himself, kills Vahi-vero and takes his wife back and makes of her eyes lights for her sister to do sennit work by and of her feet supports for the sister's work basket (Beckwith 1970:261).

Sankar Das Sarma

Sankar Das Sarma is an India-born American theoretical condensed matter physicist, who has worked in the areas of strongly correlated materials, graphene, semiconductor physics, low-dimensional systems, topological matter, quantum Hall effect, nanoscience, spintronics, collective properties of ultra-cold atomic and molecular systems, optical lattice, many-body theory, Majorana fermion, and quantum computation. His broad research areas are theoretical physics, condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and quantum information.
Career.
Das Sarma is the Richard E. Prange Chair in Physics a Distinguished University Professor [http://www.faculty.umd.edu/FacAwards/duplist.html, a Fellow of the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI), and the Director of the Condensed Matter Theory Center at the University of Maryland, College Park, where he has been on the physics faculty since 1980. Das Sarma has co-authored more than 600 articles in the Physical Review Journal series of the American Physical Society, including more than 140 publications in Physical Review Letters, and with more than 44,000 citations to his publications (and with more than 80 publications garnering more than 100 citations each) [http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iF8im5cAAAAJ&hl=en, is one of the Institute for Scientific Information Highly-Cited Researchers as well as a Thomson-Reuters Highly Cited and Most Influential Researcher [http://www.http://sciencewatch.com/grr/presenting-highly-cited-researchers. Das Sarma publishes regularly in Physical Review A, B, E, Physical Review Letters, and Reviews of Modern Physics.
In collaboration with Chetan Nayak and Michael Freedman of Microsoft Research, Das Sarma introduced the nu=5/2 topological qubit in 2005, which has led to experiments in building a fault-tolerant quantum computer based on two-dimensional semiconductor structures. In 2010 Das Sarma and his collaborators [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v104/i4/e040502 introduced the idea of generic topological quantum computation using localized Majorana fermion in ordinary semiconductor materials. Das Sarma's work on graphene has led to the theoretical understanding of graphene carrier transport properties at low densities where the inhomogeneous electron-hole puddles dominate the graphene landscape. In 2011 Das Sarma and collaborators [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v106/i23/236803 introduced a new class of lattice tight-binding flat-band systems with nontrivial Chern numbers which belongs to the universality class of continuum quantum Hall and fractional quantum Hall systems without any external magnetic fields. Such flat-band tight-binding systems with non-trivial Chern numbers have substantially enhanced the types of possible physical systems for the realization of topological matter. Among Das Sarma's other well-known theoretical contributions to quantum condensed matter physics are: the self-consistent electronic structure calculation of semiconductor heterojunction-based high electron mobility transistor structures, electron-phonon interaction induced polaron effects in low dimensional systems, collective excitation and quasiparticle modes in semiconductor structures such as quantum wire, quantum well and superlattice, hot electron relaxation in semiconductors, quantum Anderson localization, many-body effects and electron-electron interaction in semiconductors, canted antiferromagnetic states in quantum Hall effect, various spin transistor systems, magnetic polaron theory of diluted magnetic semiconductor, coupled spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, theory of quantum decoherence of localized electron spins in solids, central spin decoherence problem, spectral diffusion of electron spins in solids, dynamical decoupling and quantum control, quantum transport theory in low dimensional semiconductors, bilayer quantum Hall systems, and realistic solid state effects in the fractional quantum Hall effect phenomena. Das Sarma also made important contributions to the classical statistical mechanics problem of dynamical growth of systems far from equilibrium where his work introduced the standard model for understanding the molecular beam epitaxy of thin film growth, both from a continuum field theory viewpoint [http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v66/i18/p2348_1 in terms of the so-called Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation and from the discrete atomistic viewpoint [http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v66/i3/p325_1] in terms of the so-called Das Sarma-Tamborenea model.
Das Sarma came to the USA as a physics graduate student in 1974 after finishing his secondary school and undergraduate education in Kolkata, India where he was born. He received his PhD in physics from Brown University in 1979. Das Sarma has mentored a large number of PhD students and postdoctoral research associates at Maryland, having supervised 30 PhD students and 95 postdoctoral fellows in the 1985–2013 period, with about 75 of these advisees themselves working as theoretical physicists and physics professors all over the world. Das Sarma's research collaborators, as reflected in the coauthors of his scholarly publications, exceed 200 and span six continents. Although Das Sarma has spent his entire academic life as a faculty member at Maryland, he has been a visiting professor at many institutions during his professional career including Technical University of Munich, IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, University of Hamburg, Cambridge University, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of New South Wales, Sandia National Laboratories, University of Melbourne, Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, Institute for Theoretical Physics in Beijing, and Microsoft Station Q Research Center [http://stationq.ucsb.edu/. He is the editor of the book Perspectives in Quantum Hall Effects (ISBN 0-471-11216-X) and a co-author of several well-known review articles on many topics including spintronics, graphene, and quantum computation.
