Justin De Fratus

Justin Andrew De Fratus (born October 21, 1987) is an American professional baseball relief pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). De Fratus grew up in Oxnard, California and played in high school prior to playing at Ventura College. In the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft, the Phillies selected him in the 11th round. He methodically moved his way up through the Phillies system, spending about one year at each level from rookie to class A, and then moving through two levels per season in 2010 and 2011. In 2011, De Fratus made his MLB debut, and by 2013, he was a regular member of the Phillies bullpen.
Early career.
De Fratus attended Rio Mesa High School in Oxnard, California, from which he graduated in 2005; he was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers. His high school coach, David Soliz, asserted that he could pitch in the major leagues for a long time, saying, "He definitely has the stuff to pitch in the majors. Justin has the stuff, but he also has the confidence. The odds were against him being drafted in the 11th round out of Ventura College." De Fratus was the first Rio Mesa player to reach the majors during Soliz's tenure. He went onto attend Ventura College, where, like at Rio Mesa, he was a starting pitcher.
Professional career.
Minor leagues.
The Phillies selected De Fratus with the 353rd overall pick in the 11th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball Draft, and assigned him to the GCL Phillies, with whom he went 2-3 with a 4.30 earned run average (ERA) in 10 games (eight starts). The next season, 2008, he pitched for the Williamsport Crosscutters, and went 6-5 with a 3.67 ERA in 14 starts. He led the New York-Penn League in innings pitched, pitching at least six in almost 65% of his starts; the Phillies named him their minor league player of the week in mid-June. Before the 2009 season, at the decision of Phillies minor league pitching coordinator Gorman Heimueller and assistant general manager Chuck LaMar, De Fratus became predominantly a relief pitcher so he was "not sitting down four games out of the week" and could be a more focused pitcher. He took his first crack at relief pitching with the Lakewood Blue Claws, and ultimately began to flourish, earning Phillies minor league player of the week honors, and a spot in the South Atlantic League all-star game. On the season, he posted a 5–6 record with a 3.19 ERA in 36 games (though still with 12 starts). After the season, he participated in the Florida Instructional League. He had a successful 2010 season, splitting time between the High-A Clearwater Threshers and Double-A Reading Phillies, and posting a 1.94 ERA with 21 saves in 49 games.
Early major league career.
He began the 2011 season with Double-A Reading, and was promoted to Triple-A Lehigh Valley on June 16 after much success in Reading. He recorded seven saves with Lehigh Valley, and was named the Phillies minor league player of the week in late August, before making his MLB debut on September 18, 2011, after joining the team as a September callup. During his debut, an opposing batter fouled a ball off, and De Fratus's brother caught the ball. Ultimately, it was a scoreless debut, and he went onto pitch four more big-league games that season. At the end of the season, "Baseball America" rated him the seventh-best prospect in the Phillies minor league system. Before 2012, like in 2011, he was given an opportunity to open the season in the Phillies bullpen, but ended up injuring his shoulder, and missing much of the season; he did pitch with the big-league club in September, and by 2013, he was a regular member of the bullpen, pitching in 58 games with the big-league club, and performed well enough to be considered likely to break 2014 Spring Training firmly implanted in the Phillies bullpen. He did break spring training 2014 with the major league team. After four appearances, however, he was optioned back to the minor leagues to work on commanding his pitches. While at Lehigh Valley, he spent a significant amount of time reviewing film from his outings in 2011 and 2012, from which he learned that he had a faster pace when pitching, a more aggressive pitching style, and a lower arm slot. Just under a month later, in late May, he was recalled to the major league team, and had much success (11 consecutive scoreless appearances) as part of a Phillies' bullpen that drastically improved from the beginning of the season, and was among the best in the major leagues in early June.
Personal.
De Fratus is a devout Roman Catholic who, though he was raised in a large Catholic family, struggled with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am going to give you a little more time.’ There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar.

Burnelli RB-1

The Burnelli RB-1 was a US twin engine biplane airliner prototype from 1920, incorporating a lifting body fuselage.
Design and development.
The Burnelli RB-1, often known as the Remington-Burnelli Airliner, was an American passenger biplane from 1920, designed by Vincent Burnelli. It incorporated Burnelli's lifting-body design. Following several more conventional designs during the WWI years, Burnelli came up with the idea of a lifting body: an airfoil-shaped fuselage that could be used to generate up to 50% of the lift, improving performance. Due to the lift provided, the wingspan could be shorter and fuel consumption decreased.
The RB-1's body contributed about 27% of the total lifting area and was designed to support about 15% of its weight. The fuselage was built around plywood frames and was clad in corrugated duralumin. The two pilots were situated in a pair of open cockpits, each with a mechanic seated by his side. Its pair of Liberty engines were immediately in front of these cockpits, largely buried in the leading edge of the body but accessible from the cockpits. The body width of 14 ft (4.27 m) placed the engines only 10 ft 4 in (3.15 m) apart, with about 1 in (25 mm) clearance between propeller tips. The cabin housed up to 30 passengers. At the fixed "trailing edge" of the fuselage small twin fins mounted above its sides carried balanced rudders and short, mid-fuselage mounted tailplanes carried balanced elevators.
It was a single bay equal span biplane, with simple parallel interplane struts and without stagger. The wings were wooden structures, fabric covered. The ailerons carried on both upper and lower wings had prominent tip balances.
The RB-1 flew for the first time on 21 June 1921 from Curtiss Field, Long Island, piloted by Bert Acosta. Its performance was considered acceptable. However, the first model produced was badly damaged while on the ground during a storm.

Gordon Ingram

Gordon B. Ingram (December 30, 1924 – November 4, 2004) was an American inventor and entrepreneur. He was the founder of Military Armament Corporation, the creator of the MAC-10 and MAC-11 machine pistols, and is widely credited with popularizing the submachine gun.
Gordon B. Ingram was born in Los Angeles, California. His first foray into the weapons design world was during his years of service in the United States Army. He designed the Ingram Model 6 and later went on to design and manufacture the famous MAC-10 and MAC-11, which earned him the moniker "father of the machine pistol." His design accomplishments spanned over forty years and left behind several benchmark designs which illustrate his passion to push the envelope. His Ranchero series of range rifles was based around the concept of multiple-use weapons that all use not only the same pistol-caliber rounds but the associated magazines as well, creating a one size fits all workhorse arsenal.
Ingram was also known for his associations with some of the defense sector's largest characters, such as General Mitchell Werbel III, who designed the suppressor for the MAC-10.

Next Croatian parliamentary election

The 8th Croatian parliamentary election has to be held on or before February 20, 2016, according to the Constitution of Croatia. All 151 seats will be up for election.
Background.
The 2011 general election was held on 4 December 2011 and resulted in the victory of the centre-left Kukuriku coalition led by the Social Democratic Party and supported by the Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats, Croatian Party of Pensioners and the Istrian Democratic Assembly. The largest opposition party is the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union. Other smaller opposition parties are the Croatian Labourists – Labour Party and the Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja.
Electoral system.
The electoral system will likely see some changes compared to the last four elections. In December 2010, the Constitutional Court of Croatia decided to inform Parliament that it is necessary to update the electoral unit definitions according to current population data, in accordance with the provisions of the 1999 Law on electoral units. It was too late to change the system for the 2011 election cycle, since electoral laws cannot be changed less than a year before the election. Therefore, the next election will occur with boundary changes to accommodate shifts in the population. Minister of Public Administration Arsen Bauk announced major changes in the composition of the geographical electoral units. It is expected their number will be reduced from ten to five. They would follow the borders of Croatian counties with each encompassing several counties. This means they would not be roughly equal in size, as was the case before, but rather each district would give a different number of MPs, in proportion with their population. The population would be determined by census numbers, rather than the number of registered voters as was the case before. Two non-geographical districts, which give 3 seats for diaspora and 8 for minorities, would remain unchanged. 140 members would still come from the five geographical districts meaning the total number of seats would still be 151. Proportional representation would still be the method of electing members, however it is not clear whether the D'Hondt method would remain and whether there would be an introduction of open lists.

Violin Sonata No. 36 (Mozart)

The Sonata in F for Violin and Keyboard, K. 547, was completed on July 10, 1788 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The sonata is often nicknamed "For Beginners" and was completed two weeks after the similarly nicknamed piano sonata in C major, K. 545. Unlike the previous few keyboard sonatas, where the violin played in equal role, this sonata is dominated by the keyboard part. In that regard, only the violin part is easy and the keyboard part is not "for beginners".
There are three movements all in the tonic key of F major:
The movements are ordered in a non-standard manner with the "slow" movement first and the expansive "Allegro" in sonata form form placed second. There is significant dialogue between the violin and keyboard in the opening movement, but the keyboard dominates the latter two. The sonata ends with a set of six variations on a simple theme. The fourth variation is the only variation to feature the violin prominently and the fifth variation is in F minor for keyboard alone. 
The second movement was arranged for solo piano along with a transcription of the finale of the piano sonata in C, K. 545 to form the Piano Sonata in F major, K. 547a.

<doc id="31164501" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31164501" title="Supervised visitation">
Supervised visitation

Supervised visitation allows parents in high conflict or high risk situations access to their children in a safe and supervised environment. The noncustodial parent has access to the child only when supervised by another adult. Supervised visitation is used to protect children from potentially dangerous situations while allowing parental access and providing support for the parent child relationship.
Legal status.
Most countries recognize a parent's right to children, called visitation, residence, or contact. Most courts, including American and European, will allow the parent who does not have primary custody (the noncustodial parent) to have specified visitation and access to the child. In America the parents must establish a parenting plan setting out specific details. If the parents are not able to agree, the court may order specific possession and access or may appoint a parenting coordinator to assist the parents. The United States recognizes that parents have a constitutional right to their children (See Troxel v. Granville). In this case the United States Supreme Court stated that "the interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children--is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court." In most of the US states there is a law required that court-ordered parenting plans must set forth the "minimum amount" of parenting time and type of access (i.e. supervised/unsupervised) a non-custodial parent is entitled to have. According to the state laws and court guidelines, the Custody Supervisor cannot change the court order to make major modifications to the amount of parenting time and access, only the minor changes or clarification of parenting time/access schedules or conditions including vacation, holidays, and temporary variation from the existing parenting plan are allowed.
Purpose.
The purpose of supervised visitation is to provide a safe and neutral environment for children to have a relationship with parents, and is often used in high conflict situations. Many courts take the position that it is better to make an error that protects the child as opposed to leaving a child at risk. There are many reasons supervised visitation may be needed: 
Types.
Supervised visitation has many forms, including one-on-one supervision, group supervision, neutral or monitored exchange, telephone or video monitoring, and therapeutic supervision. .
World wide.
Supervised visitation is growing worldwide as the protection of children from child abuse, and child abduction (International child abduction in Japan) becomes a growing concern. 
. Supervised visitation bridges the gap between keeping the child safe and supporting the family relationship and parental rights. One constant, world wide, is that supervised visitation has few legal guidelines as little legislation addresses it directly. However, many courts and state departments have set guidelines regarding supervised visitation.
Who supervises.
Since there are few guidelines, who supervises depends on the provider. Friends or family members may be ordered or agree to supervise, or be present during the visit. Professional providers may also be used, depending on the court order. 
Professional supervision providers will cost more, but the benefits are great.
Records.
Most professional providers require intake forms or an application and maintain intake records. Privacy is of utmost concern, especially when there is a history of domestic violence. Many providers also document visits and maintain visit records. There is controversy over what, if any, records may be used in court. Documentation can be very helpful for parents needing to prove or disprove conduct, such as parent alienation.
Prepare for Visits.
Sometimes the noncustodial parent or any party being supervised may feel resentful and nervous. Some feel angry at having to pay to see their children. Having a good attitude is important for making the most of the visit. Also preparation is key. 
The custodial parent must also prepare. Attitude is key.
The visit will go much smoother with special care to prepare the child.

Huda Ben Amer

Huda Ben Amer (in Arabic هدى بن عامر) is a former Libyan politician. A follower of the Libyan ruler, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, she was the Secretary of the General People's Congress of Inspection People's Control and mayor of Benghazi until the Libyan civil war.
Ben Amer was born in Marj near Benghazi and attended the Garyounis University in Benghazi. Belonging to a poor family without influence, Ben Amer rose to national prominence at a public execution staged by the Gaddafi government in 1984. The event in Benghazi's basketball stadium had been announced as the trial of one of Gaddafi's political enemies, al-Sadek Hamed Al-Shuwehdy, an engineer who had been peacefully campaigning against the colonel's rule. But instead the schoolchildren and students who had been assembled for the purpose were made to see al-Shuwehdy's execution by hanging. While the hanged man writhed on the gallows, Ben Amer stepped forward and grabbed al-Shuwehdy's legs, pulling him down until he stopped struggling and died.
That display of ruthlessness, about which she later liked to boast—she is remembered in Benghazi by her saying "we don't need talking, we need hangings"—earned her the enduring loathing of the people of Benghazi and the nickname "Huda Al-Shannaga"—"Huda the Executioner". However, it impressed Gaddafi, who had been watching the execution on live TV. He subsequently promoted Ben Amer to high government posts, including twice mayor of Benghazi and a leading member of the Legion Thoria, Gaddafi's organization of revolutionary committees. Eventually she became a favorite of Gaddafi, and one of the richest and most powerful women in Libya.
In the course of the national uprising in early 2011, a crowd stormed Ben Amer's sprawling mansion in Benghazi and, finding her gone, burned it to the ground. Later in March 2011, she was seen next to Gaddafi on one of his televised addresses. On 2 September 2011, Guma el-Gamaty, the UK coordinator of the National Transitional Council posted on Twitter that Ben Amer had been arrested in Tripoli by NTC forces.

Coat of arms of Lübeck

The Hanseatic city of Lübeck has for a long time had a double coat of arms — one with the eagle as a symbol of the Imperial freedom enjoyed by the city from 1226 to 1937; one with Hanseatic colors of silver over red and the so-called "Lübeck plate".
History.
The origin of the Lübeck shield is not certain, but thought to be derived from the Hanseatic flag, first seen on a ship's seal in 1230. This is also the oldest reference to its own national emblem of the city, with the Imperial eagle appearing a little later, first seen on early 14th-century coins. The colors of the shield are thought not to come from the County of Holstein, but from the Imperial arms. From around 1450 the two arms were found combined, the eagle bearing the Hanseatic coat of arms as breast shield. Its continued use today makes it the oldest coat of arms of Schleswig-Holstein.
After the inclusion of Lübeck into the First French Empire on 1 January 1811, the city received a new coat of arms, to emphasise the position of Lübeck as a community within the French state. In this emblem, designed by the "Conseil du Sceau", the traditional red-and-white coat of arms sat on a pair of black eagle's wings, an approximate representation of the Lübeck double eagle; this combination on a white field. As Lübeck was one of the "Bonnes villes" of the Empire, a chief gules, with three golden Imperial bees, was added. This coat of arms was awarded to Lübeck by Napoleon Bonaparte on 13 June 1811 with a signed "Wappenbrief". After liberation from French rule in 1813, and the restoration of Lübeck's status as an independent city-state, the traditional coat of arms was reinstated.
With the abolition of Lübeck's independence in the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937, annexing it to the Free State of Prussia, as a part of the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, the city was permitted to keep its old coat of arms.

Integrated Child Development Services (India)

Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) (Hindi: समेकित बाल विकास सेवाए), Government of India sponsored programme, is India's primary social welfare scheme to tackle malnutrition and health problems in children below 6 years of age and their mothers. The main beneficiaries of the programme were aimed to be the children below 6 years of age, pregnant and lactating mothers, and adolescent girls. The gender promotion of the girl child by trying to bring her at par with the male child is a key component of the scheme. []
Background.
Majority of children in India have underprivileged childhoods starting from birth. The infant mortality rate of Indian children is 44 and the under-five mortality rate is 93 and 25% of newborn children are underweight among other nutritional, immunization and educational deficiencies of children in India. Figures for India are substantially worse than the "developing country average".
Given such a daunting challenge, ICDS was first launched in 1975 in accordance to the National Policy for Children in India. Over the years it has grown into one of the largest integrated family and community welfare schemes in the world. Given its effectiveness over the last few decades, Government of India has committed towards ensuring universal availability of the programme.
Objectives.
The predefined objectives of ICDS are: 
Scope of Services.
The following services are sponsored under ICDS to help achieve its objectives:
Implementation.
For nutritional purposes ICDS provides 300 calories (with 8-10 grams of protein) every day to every child below 6 years of age. For adolescent girls it is up to 500 calories with up to 25 grams of protein everyday.
Delivery of services under ICDS scheme is managed in an integrated manner through Anganwadi centres, its workers and helpers. The services of Immunisation, Health Check-up and Referral Services delivered through Public Health Infrastructure under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. UNICEF has provided essential supplies for the ICDS scheme since 1975. World Bank has also assisted with the financial and technical support for the programme. The cost of ICDS programme averages $10–$22 per child a year. The scheme is Centrally sponsored with the state governments contributing up to per day per child.
Furthermore, in 2008, the GOI adopted the World Health Organization (WHO) standards for measuring and monitoring the child growth and development, both for the ICDS and the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). These standards were developed by WHO through an intensive study of six developing countries since 1997. They are known as New WHO Child Growth Standard and measure of physical growth, nutritional status and motor development of children from birth to 5 years age.
Impact.
By end of 2010, the programme is claiming to reach 80.6 lakh expectant and lactating mothers along with 3.93 crore children (under 6 years of age). There are 6,719 operational projects with 1,241,749 operational Aanganwadi centres. Several positive benefits of the programme have been documented and reported
However, World Bank has also highlighted certain key shortcomings of the programme including inability to target the girl child improvements, participation of wealthier children more than the poorer children and lowest level of funding for the poorest and the most undernourished states of India.

Sergey Lomonosov graduated from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum with a silver medal in 1817 and then began his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A year later Lomonosov was sent to the Russian embassy in Washington. Upon his return to St Petersburg in 1821, Sergey Lomonosov was sent to Spain to assist Count Mark Bulgari (a Russian charge d'affairs). After some time he was transferred to Paris as a secretary at the Russian embassy, where he remained until 1829. In 1831, Sergey Lomonosov was appointed charge d'affairs to Copenhagen and then as first secretary to London. In 1841, he was appointed charge d'affairs to Brazil. During his stay in South America, he travelled along the Brazilian coast from Rio de Janeiro to the estuary of the Amazon River and probably became the first Russian ever to introduce this country to Russia.

Nelson Hummingbird PG-185B

The Nelson Hummingbird PG-185B is an American, tandem two seat, mid-wing motor glider that was developed by Nelson Aircraft after discontinuing the Nelson Dragonfly.
Design and development.
In 1949, Nelson began the design of another self-launching glider, but this time, he teamed-up with Harry Perl and Don Mitchell. They called this new design the "Hummingbird".
Introduced in 1953, the Hummingbird was an attempt to improve upon the marginal performance of the Dragonfly, of which only seven were produced.
The resulting design is a mid-wing glider built predominately from wood, with the wing leading edge filled with styrofoam and doped aircraft fabric used on the aft portion of the wing, the tail and the rudder. After the first two were completed the remainder were built from metal in place of wood.
The design features an all-flying stabilator with an anti-servo tab, spoilers on the wing's top surface and dive brakes on the bottom. The Nelson H-59 4-cylinder engine was mounted on a retractable mast aft of the bubble canopy. The aircraft has two wheels in tandem, the front being steerable and connected to the rudder pedals. 
The design was not type certified, and the seven built were registered under the "Experimental - Racing - Exhibition" category. Nelson later sold the rights to the aircraft and the engine to Charles Rhoades of Naples, Florida.
Operational history.
In the mid-1950s a Hummingbird was flown by Les Arnold to an unofficial US motorgliding distance record of .
In March 2011 there were still five registered in the USA, two of which had been transferred to the National Soaring Museum.

"I Wanna Go" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears, released as the third single from her seventh studio album, "Femme Fatale" (2011). It was written and produced by Max Martin and Shellback, with additional writing by Savan Kotecha. Spears first posted on her Twitter account a link to a clip of the song in February 2011, a month prior to the album's release. Following a poll on her official website, "I Wanna Go" was chosen as the third single of the album, and Jive Records released it on June 13, 2011.
"I Wanna Go" is a Hi-NRG song that features a heavy bassline and drum fills reminiscent of English rock band New Order. The pre-chorus has a whistled hook that received comparisons to the music of Bob Sinclar and Frankie Knuckles. The lyrics of "I Wanna Go" feature Spears singing about losing inhibitions. The song received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Some praised it for being effective and highlighted its hook, while others dismissed the processed vocals. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Bollywood mix with guest vocals by Sonu Nigam and another one by DJ Frank E and Alex Dreamz.
After the release of "Femme Fatale", "I Wanna Go" charted due to digital sales in the lower end of the US "Billboard" Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100, and also topped the South Korean International chart. Following its release as a single, the song reached the top ten in several music markets, including Canada, France, Finland and the United States. However, it became one of her lowest peaking singles in countries such as Australia and New Zealand, and was the first single of her career that failed to chart inside the top 100 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, "I Wanna Go" made "Femme Fatale" the first album by Spears to have three top ten singles.
An accompanying music video for the song, directed by Chris Marrs Piliero, premiered on June 22, 2011. It depicts Spears daydreaming at a press conference about a series of events, including being chased by paparazzi cyborgs and being rescued by actor Guillermo Díaz. Piliero described the video as "a ridiculous, exaggerated rumor about her life and career". The video references films such as "Half Baked", "Crossroads", "" and "Michael Jackson's Thriller". It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its fun spirit. Spears has performed "I Wanna Go" on the Femme Fatale Tour (2011) and (2013).
Background and artwork.
"I Wanna Go" was written and produced by Max Martin and Shellback, with additional writing by Savan Kotecha. The song was written in 2009 and registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title "I I I Wanna Go O O". On February 22, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 29-second clip of the song, while calling Martin "amazing". In an interview with "Rolling Stone", Spears stated that the song's signature whistle gets her "every time hears it", adding that Martin's melodies are "Incredible ... Who would have thought of that? There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio." Kotecha told Digital Spy in May 2011 that the song was likely a contender for third single due to positive reaction. On May 11, 2011, a poll was launched on Britney.com in which fans could choose the third single of the album. Two days later, "I Wanna Go" was officially announced as the third single from "Femme Fatale" by Jive Records through a press release after winning the poll. The cover art was revealed on June 6, 2011, and featured Spears on set of the music video, wearing colored hair extensions and a top with a skeletal Mickey Mouse.
Composition.
"I Wanna Go" is a hi-NRG song, which features a heavy bassline and drum fills; the latter are reminiscent of English band New Order's song "Blue Monday" (1983). Spears squeals and chuckles throughout the song, and her vocals are processed. In the pre-chorus, she draws out the "e"'s in lines such as "Shame on me / To need release / Uncontrollably." The section also has a whistled hook, which was compared by Rich Juzwiak of "The Village Voice" to the music of French recording artist Bob Sinclar and American recording artist Frankie Knuckles. In the chorus, Spears stutters "I-I-I wanna go-o-o/All the wa-a-ay/ Taking out my freak tonight". Ryan Brockington of the "New York Post" compared "I Wanna Go" to the music of her fifth studio album "Blackout" (2007). In the lyrics, Spears sings about losing inhibitions, as evident in lines such as "I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow/All the dir-ir-irt/I got (sic) running through my mind.", while playfully apologizing for her need for sexual release. Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" stated that she sings about "the scrum that surrounds her" in "Lately people got me all tied up / There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt". According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, "I Wanna Go" is written in the key of D minor, with an electropop beat infused metronome of 138 beats per minute. Spears' vocals range from the low note of E3 to the high note of D5.
Critical reception.
A reviewer for Samesame.com.au called "I Wanna Go" Spears' best song since "Toxic", and added that "I’d go so far as to say that it is probably the best song that she has ever recorded. [...] How the decision was made that 'Hold It Against Me' would be a better first single over this is baffling." Parker Bruce of the "Washington Square News" stated that the song functions as "a sort of formal declaration and mission statement" for "Femme Fatale", saying that "It is not an innovative song, but it is fantastically effective and endlessly enticing with its liberating, toss-your-cares-away, dance-like-a-complete–and-utter-fool cathartic chorus, repeated words and typically saucy Britney lyrics." "The Daily Collegian" writer Hannah Rishel said "I Wanna Go" would have been "another good lead single", while "The Washington Times"s Andrew Leahey said that along with "Till the World Ends", they are "bass-heavy tributes to club culture."
Robert Copsey of Digital Spy called it "anthemic" and noted the song would become a future single. Rich Juzwiak of "The Village Voice" called "I Wanna Go" the highlight of the album, and said "get ready for to score your summer." However, Juzwiak went on to note that Spears' vocals are heavily manipulated to maximize the chorus's potential, even though "the joy she sings about is palpable." The "Chicago Sun-Times" journalist Thomas Conner also noted that the singer's vocals were processed to the point "these songs could be sung by anyone", exemplifying I Wanna Go' tweaks her up so high she could be Jackie Evancho." Andy Gill of "The Independent" also criticized the singer's vocals on "Femme Fatale", stating that they sounded more programmed than natural, with "even the little whistling hook in 'I Wanna Go' has a synthetic character about it."
Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that "If not for its infectious pre-chorus whistle, 'I Wanna Go' would be just another song off the Max Martin assembly line". "The Guardian" contributor Alexis Petridis gave the song a negative review, and said that although most of tracks of the album are "genuinely exciting [...] there's certainly some unremarkable stuff on offer, notably 'Seal It With a Kiss' and 'I Wanna Go." Evan Sawdey of PopMatters also noted that "I Wanna Go" is the point of the album in which "things stop being fun and start becoming intensely repetitious", criticizing specifically "utterly stupid set of syllables repeated ad nauseam for no reason whatsoever? [.. the 'ably' part of 'uncontrollably' gets recycled far beyond the point where it just sounds stupid." In September 2011, "I Wanna Go" topped "Rolling Stone"s reader's poll of The Best Songs of the Summer.
Chart performance.
On the chart issue of April 3, 2011, "I Wanna Go" debuted at number 73 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, and at number 52 on the Hot Digital Songs component chart due to strong digital sales.

Music video.
Development.
The music video for "I Wanna Go" was directed by Chris Marrs Piliero and filmed in Los Angeles, California. Spears first contacted Piliero and asked him to put together a concept for the video. The main idea for Marrs Piliero came from the lyric "be a little inappropriate", which stood out for him, but he did not want to make a video about sexual inappropriateness. Piliero wrote the opening press conference scene as a tribute to the film "Half Baked" (1998), which he is a fan of. He explained, "That scene resonates with everyone as the epitome of the greatest way to quit your job, and just blow people off. [...] I felt like that would just be such a perfect way for her to tell the reporters to eff off." Marrs Piliero first asked actor Kellan Lutz to co-star the clip with Spears; however, Lutz turned down the role, saying that "there were a couple of weird things about the part that didn't make sense", including the scene where he was going to pour milk on himself. Piliero then thought of asking one of the stars of "Half Baked", Guillermo Díaz, to be part of the video, explaining that it "would make it come full circle." Piliero watched all of Spears' videos and wanted to pull what he loved from them, but also give it something fresh. Piliero felt that all of her references to the paparazzi in her previous videos had been more of a statement than an action, and for "I Wanna Go", he wanted her to have the opportunity to fight back.
Piliero had the concept nearly finished by the time he met with Spears. Both wanted to explore fun ways for Spears to be inappropriate in the video, who had several ideas, such as a cop frisking her. Having seen Spears on "How I Met Your Mother" and "Saturday Night Live", Piliero felt that none of her videos had really taken advantage of her comedic timing, saying, "She never had a music video where she could show her acting chops and have fun with comedy while being super badass. That was my goal from day one: I wanted her to be funny, badass and super cool.". During the first day of the shoot, he requested Spears to "have as much fun as possible over these next two days". Pilliero also stated that the "Crossroads" (2002) reference "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, "Die Hard 2: Die Harder" is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel. It just felt like the right thing to do. When Britney saw it, she loved it."
Synopsis.
The video begins at a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in "The New Mickey Mouse Club"), is being asked inappropriate questions by news reporters, such as "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film "Half Baked". After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of "Femme Fatale" and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman. As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.
She continues walking down the street, where she smashes the camera of a paparazzi photographer who takes pictures of her. More paparazzi appear as she runs away and jumps on top of a taxi. Spears then stands atop of it, wielding the microphone as a weapon against the paparazzi who are hassling her. Across the street, a marquee of the cinema besides her reads "Crossroads 2: Cross Harder", referencing her film debut "Crossroads". After all the paparazzi, revealed to be cyborgs, have been knocked to the floor, they start crawling back with their eyes glowing red and their faces bursting with wires, reminiscent to a scene in "" (1991). A car suddenly pulls up near to Spears, and the driver Guillermo Díaz tells her to get inside. In the next scene, Spears dances in the passenger seat in a pink bikini top, as Guillermo drives.He attempts to drink some milk while driving but pours the carton of milk over his face. His chest starts to spark, and Spears pulls open his jacket to reveal that he too is a cyborg. The video then cuts back to the press conference, indicating that Spears was daydreaming, due to being asked monotonous and inappropriate questions. Guillermo steps in and leads Spears out of the room. Then, he turns to the camera with his eyes glowing red, and his laugh is heard, referencing "Michael Jackson's Thriller" (1983).
Release and reception.
On June 17, 2011, Jive Records announced through a press release that an exclusive 30-second teaser would premiere on June 19, 2011, on Bravo's "Watch What Happens: Live" and on VEVO simultaneously. The full length video was revealed to premiere on MTV and VEVO on June 22, 2011. Following the premiere, the video was played hourly on MTV, during video hours, and on VH1's "Best Morning Buzz Live". Jen McDonnell of "Dose" said, "damn if video doesn't rock. [...] It all sounds very weird – and it is. But it's also buckets of fun." Megan Gibson of "Time" stated that the video is "It's random, weird and intended to be funny" and that despite the lack of dancing "Britney seems pleasantly energetic and spunky in 'I Wanna Go' which is a comforting change from her usual blank-eyed look." Sarah Anne Hughes of "The Washington Post" commented that the video "shows a much livelier Britney than the world has seen since the 'Toxic' years."
Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" said that the video continues the visual representation of Spears' relationship with the paparazzi and her public image, as previously seen in the videos for "Everytime" (2004) and "Piece of Me" (2008), but "the new clip is arguably her most playful yet." Amos Barshad of "New York" stated the video "is awe-inspiring in "almost exactly the way it intended to be"" and that "the spirit of the song, as reflected in the video, is that of free will and dream fulfillment in the face of a repressive society." Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented that "Britney displays the sass and charm fans fell in love with a decade ago during performance shots, where she flirts with the camera, her eyes as big and wide as her smile." An editor for VH1 called the video "fan-freakin'-tastic" and compared it favorably to the music video for Katy Perry's "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" (2011), saying that "they share a silly temperament, a flirty star, and funny cameos. Upon closer examination, though, Britney's video blows Katy Perry's out of the water."
Devin Brown of CBS News called it her best video from "Femme Fatale", and added that unlike "Piece of Me", I Wanna Go' offers a bevy of pop culture references meant to ridicule the rumors about the star – and finally no 'dancing. An editor from "Rolling Stone" said "The weirdness seems very calculated, but that doesn't make the video any less delightful." Another critic from "Rolling Stone" noted that the press conference "is hysterical because she's one of the least media-accessible singers in the world. It's easier to get a sit-down with Bob Dylan than it is with Britney." Becky Bain of Idolator called the video "delightful" and "flat out funny", explaining that Spears "focuses her energy on being too darn cute (and deliciously naughty) instead of having to worry about dancing, is in on the joke and loving it all."
The video was Spears' first to be VEVO Certified which means that it was the first of her videos to have received over 100 million views on VEVO
Live performances.
Though the song has never been performed live as part of a televised performance, "I Wanna Go" was featured on the set list of the Femme Fatale Tour (2011). Spears and her dancers bring fans onstage and dance with them throughout the performance. Shirley Halperin of "The Hollywood Reporter" stated that "mid-tempo numbers [... seemed to stall out quickly, where faster offerings like 'Womanizer,' 'I Wanna Go' and 'Toxic' had the sold out crowd jumping in place and pumping their number twos in the air." Shaunna Murphy of "Entertainment Weekly" said, "Of the newer songs, 'How I Roll' and 'I Wanna Go' were standouts, the former for its bubblegum fun and the latter for the uproarious fan participation on stage."
Remixes and other versions.
"I Wanna Go" was remixed with guest vocals by Indian singer Sonu Nigam and released on the DesiHits website in June 2011. In the remix, Sonu mirrors Spears' vocals in Hindi over Indian instruments. Spears said about the song, "I'm so excited about having Sonu on I Wanna Go. His vocals add such a different feel, which I love! Watch out Bollywood – it's Britney and Sonu!". A remix done by DJ Frank E and Alex Dreamz removes the whistled hook and adds an extra beat to the song. The accompanying video for the remix contains footage of the music video for the song with a glowing yellow tint.
"I Wanna Go" was sampled send of the beginning of the song "Destinada a brillar" of argentian telenovela "Violetta".

Plot.
During her freshman year in high school, Mika Tahara loses her cell phone, but later finds it in the school library with the help of an unknown caller. Throughout the summer, Mika and the mysterious caller continue to communicate, and agree to meet each other once school starts again. The caller turns out to be Hiro, a delinquent-like boy that Mika is initially afraid of, who shows proof of his identity as the caller with a photo of the sky on his cellular phone.
From her friends and through her first sexual encounter with Hiro, Mika learns that he had a girlfriend named Saki. Although Hiro reassures her that he broke up with her, Saki, who still is in love with Hiro, holds a vendetta against Mika and hires a group of men to rape her. The horrific encounter ends with Hiro and his older sister Minako punishing both the men and Saki, but Mika continues to be harassed at school when Saki spreads rumors about her. Hiro protects Mika from all of the bullying advances, but she assures him that she's not frightened from being with him.
Mika later becomes pregnant after she and Hiro consummate in the school library. Hiro is thrilled by the news and both of them gain Hiro's parents' permission to raise the child together, although Mika's parents disapprove of the action. Despite this, Mika is determined to have the baby. After an altercation with Saki, the baby's birth ends in a miscarriage. Despaired, Mika and Hiro build a grave for their baby and promise each other to come visit the memorial yearly on the day of the baby's death.
Shortly after their second year in high school begins, Hiro begins to distance himself from Mika and breaks up with her. Although hurt, Mika meets a college student named Yū at a gōkon, who becomes sympathetic to her situation. The two date, and Yū even prevents Mika's parents from divorcing. On the day of the baby's death, Mika finds Hiro visiting the grave as per their promise. The next year, she continues to move on from Hiro; however, on the day of the baby's death, Mika finds Nozomu at the grave. Nozomu reveals Hiro's illness, and that he was asked by Hiro himself to watch over Mika.
Mika breaks up with Yū and finds Hiro in the hospital, diagnosed with cancer, with only three months left to live. Upset that he pretended he didn't love her only to ensure she would have a happy future, she insists that only he can make her happy. Hiro eventually gives into his feelings and gets back together with her. Mika begins to visit the hospital daily, even taking an academic leave, to take care of Hiro, who slowly begins to show signs of recovery. Hiro's resolve to live becomes stronger until he dies during a check-up. Mika is saddened by Hiro's death and tries to commit suicide, but is stopped by a flock of birds flying towards her. She takes this as a sign of Hiro, in the sky, discouraging her from killing herself, and realizes through this and Hiro's journal that he would have wanted her to continue to live. Seven years later, she reflects on how her life had changed upon meeting Hiro, and that she is living happily with him and their baby in mind.
Production.
Development.
On April 19, 2007, a film for "Koizora" was green-lit and was to be directed by TBS director Natsuki Imai. Imai's previous works included television dramas "Orange Days" and "Taiyou no Uta", and "Koizora" was her first experience directing a film.
As the "Koizora" film was loosely adapted from the original cell phone novel, changes were made so that the film could fit 129 minutes. In the original novel, the way Mika and Hiro met was different. Initially, Mika's phone number is given to Nozomu, who repeatedly called her much to her dismay. However, one night, when he was drunk dialing Mika, Hiro confiscated the phone and began talking to her instead.
Pre-production.
News of actress Yui Aragaki cast as Mika in the film together with the announcement of this film on April 19, 2007. On May 13, 2007, Haruma Miura and Keisuke Koide were cast as Hiroki and Yū respectively.

The Marathon (mixtape)

The Marathon is the fifth official mixtape by American rapper Nipsey Hussle. It was released on December 21, 2010 for free legal download and for download on iTunes. The mixtape was released by All Money In Records.
Background.
He released the mixtape around the time he was trying to get out of his record deal with Epic Records so he could release his debut album South Central State of Mind independently. The mixtape's theme is a "declaration of independence from the confines of the traditional music biz that forced him to endure over two years worth of delayed celebration for the still-pending release of his formal debut, "South Central State of Mind"."
Singles.
The first single from the album is "Keys to the City". The official music video was released June 6, 2011 on Vimeo and was directed by Dan "The Man" Melamid, who also directed the video for Nipsey Hussle's 2009 single, "Hussle In The House". The song was released for retail sale on September 2, 2013.
Controversy.
On the first leak off the mixtape, "Mr. Untouchable," Nipsey raps a bar that says: "High 'til we die, so it's muthafucc a Detox" which Nipsey in a interview with "Vibe", stated it was not a diss line to West Coast rapper/producer Dr. Dre and his third studio album "Detox". He also maintained the diss was "...nothin’ personal. I ain’t never really reached out to Dre, or Dre ain’t never really reached out to me, so it ain’t a shot against him, it’s just, my focus is on what I’m doing now." 
Critical reception.
XXL made the mixtape the 49th best mixtape of 2010 and praised Nipsey's ability to bring back an earlier era of West coast hip hop music.

Ying Shao

Ying Shao (t. 應劭/s. 应劭, 140-206 CE), also called Ling Shao, style name Zhongyuan (仲瑗), was a Chinese writer and historian of the late Eastern Han period (25–220 CE), an author of the famous work "Fengsu Tongyi", an encyclopedic work about the folk customs and legends that existed in the Eastern Han state. Ying Shao occupied official posts in the administration of the Eastern Han, and in his official position he was an active participant in the political life of the Late Han period. He was a long-time close associate of Cao Cao, and in that connection he was extensively covered in the "Hou Han Shu" chapters 9, 35, 71, and 103, and in chapter 10 of the novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms".
Biography.
Ying Shao was originally from Runan. In the early 190s, Ying Shao is known to be a Grand Administrator of Mount Tai in Xu Province. He repelled an attack on his commandery by the remnants of the Yellow Turban rebels, recorded in the "Hou Han Shu". In 193-194, Cao Cao attacked Xu province to seek vengeance for the murder of his father, thus Ying Shao fled from Mount Tai and took refuge with the opposing warlord Yuan Shao. By the time Cao Cao defeated the Yuan family and conquered Hebei, Ying Shao was already dead. The interim events are given in two versions in the Pei Songzhi's annotations to the Sanguo Zhi, Guo Song's (郭頒) "Shiyu" (世語) version and Wei Zhao's "Book of Wu" (吳書) version.

Helio (Cambridge Glass)

Helio (Cambridge Glass) is a type of glassware produced by Cambridge Glass beginning in 1923. The color of Helio has been described as part of the purple family and has been compared to the color lavender. It also falls into the category of opaque glass, however the color changes depending on the light source. The variation of purple does vary between pieces but the color is consistent within the piece itself. 
It is believed that Helio was only produced for a short time because it is not mentioned in trade journals after 1924.
Design.
The majority of the pieces produced were of simple design. For the most part, they were free of any decoration. However, there are some pieces that do have a gold leaf pattern or even with a black dragon design. This is true for any of the opaque colors made in the 1920s.
Heliotrope.
Collectors of Helio will also refer to it as Heliotrope referring to the color of the glass. However, this name has not been found in any printed material from Cambridge Glass.
History of the colors in Cambridge Glass.
The Colors of Cambridge Glass were a main selling point. When the first catalog came out in 1903, it was in color. The number and variety of colors is not clear. In the early 1970s it was thought that there were around 35 colors but as of 1984, there have been new colors found bring the total to around 50.
Other colors of opaque glass include Ebony, Ivory, Primrose, Azurite, Jade and Avocado.
The Chemists.
Most of the records of the colors created by the chemists at Cambridge Glass have not survived. Little is also known about the Chemists themselves. Arnold Fielder worked at Cambridge from around 1916-1917 to the mid-1920s. He is thought to have produced most of the colors during this time.

Alfred Basel

Alfred Basel (23 March 1876 – 24 January 1920) was an Austrian painter and etcher. 
Born in Vienna to a factory owner, Basel studied at the Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule under Felician von Myrbach between 1892 and 1898. He was a reserve officer during the First World War, serving with the rank of "Oberleutnant" in the Fourth Army on the Galician front from March 1915. In the fall he fell ill and was declared unfit for military service. By November he was a war artist serving the Kriegspressequartier. In 1916 he was on the Vistula, in the Carpathians, in Albania, on the Isonzo, and in the Ukraine. It was his artistic breakthrough. 
In 1919, at the winter exhibition of the Wiener Künstlerhaus, Basel exhibited his work outside of the Kriegspressequartier for the first time. His treatment of military events was careful and accurate, and both stylistically and biographically he has many similarities to Oskar Laske. Like him, Basel avoids sensationalising or exaggerating, and favours crowds of small figures and a simplicity approaching photographic accuracy. 
Alfred died from the effects of a hunting accident in Dickenau, Türnitz, Lower Austria.

Lolliguncula brevis

Lolliguncula brevis, or the Atlantic brief squid, is a small species of squid in the Loliginidae family. It is found in shallow parts of the western Atlantic Ocean.
Distribution.
The Atlantic brief squid occurs most frequently in shallow waters along the eastern seaboard of the United States as far north as Maryland. It has also been found in Argentina, Brazil, the British Virgin Islands, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela.
Description.
The female Atlantic brief squid is about 11 cm long and the male 9 cm. The basic colour is dark reddish-brown to yellow-brown and there are many chromatophores on the upper surface which enable the squid to change colour. The mantle is widest in the middle and tapers to a rounded point at the back. The fins are wider than they are long, rounded and about half the length of the mantle. The mantle has thick muscular walls and a large water-filled cavity and is separated from the head by a collar. The head has two large eyes, the structure of which is very similar to vertebrate eyes. There is a funnel underneath the head which is used in locomotion. There are five pairs of appendages. Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 5 are short tapering arms with two rows of suckers. The left 5th appendage of males is modified to form a hectocotylus arm which is used to transfer spermatophores into the female reproductive organ. The other pair of appendages are contractile tentacles and are much longer than the arms. These have clubs with four rows of suckers at the distal end and are used for capturing food which is then transferred to the arms. The posterior end of the female mantle is occupied by a pair of white nidamental glands which secrete the material from which the egg capsule is formed.
Biology.
This species is found in warm shallow waters, often at the mouths of rivers where it seems to tolerate low salinity levels. It eats small fish and crustaceans. In order to move, water inside the mantle cavity is expelled through the funnel by muscular contraction of the mantle walls. To catch fast moving prey, the contraction is vigorous, sending a jet of water through the funnel which is directed backwards. To escape a predator, the funnel is directed forwards and the squid shoots backwards at great speed. It can also emit a cloud of ink to distract the predator. Eggs are deposited in a gelatinous capsule attached to the sea bed. The large-yolked eggs hatch into fully formed miniature versions of the parent squid.

César Hernández (infielder)

César Augusto Hernández (born May 23, 1990) is a switch-hitting Major League Baseball second baseman and center fielder for the Philadelphia Phillies organization. A native of Valencia, Carabobo in Venezuela, the Phillies signed Hernandez as an undrafted amateur free agent at age 16. He slowly progressed through the lower levels of the Phillies' farm system, however ultimately caught speed upon reaching Class A, and from there took only three seasons to make his major league debut, substituting for Michael Young during the 2013 Philadelphia Phillies season. Later in the season, he dabbled as a center fielder, helping to replace an injured Ben Revere. Entering the 2014 season, his status on the major league roster was uncertain, however he had established himself as a solid prospect to play in the major leagues at some point.
Professional career.
Early career (2007–2010).
After the Phillies signed him on July 2, 2006 as an amateur free agent, Hernández began his professional career in 2007, spending his first two seasons with the Venezuelan Summer League (VSL) Phillies upon being signed as an amateur free agent at age 16. That year, he hit .276 with 8 triples in 54 games; he committed 15 errors. In the Venezuelan Summer League again in 2008, Hernandez hit .315 with 19 stolen bases in 60 games, reducing his error total to 8. Between his two seasons in the VSL, he made 59 starts as a second baseman and 35 starts as a shortstop. He advanced a level in 2009, joining the Gulf Coast League (GCL) Phillies, with whom he played solely second base, and hit .267 with 13 stolen bases in 41 games. He also participated in the Florida Instructional League during the 2009 season. 
Hernandez's improvement earned him another promotion in 2010, when he advanced to the Williamsport Crosscutters of the New York-Penn League (NY-Penn), with whom he enjoyed significant success. He was named an NY-Penn all star, and his teammates voted him as their most valuable player (MVP). In 2010, he hit .325, including .391 against left-handed pitchers, and added 32 stolen bases. After the season, he played in the Venezuelan Winter League as a member of the Bravos de Margarita, the first of several seasons after which he would return home and continue to play baseball.
Upper levels of the minor leagues (2011-2012).
Entering the 2011 season, "Baseball America" ranked Hernandez the Phillies 14th best prospect, and the best defensive infielder after the 2012 season. John Sickels, a minor league baseball analyst for SBNation.com, noted that, entering the 2011 season, Hernandez was an "overlooked" prospect with upper-echelon speed. In 2011, he played for the Clearwater Threshers, the Phillies' affiliate in Class A-Advanced, and amassed a .268 batting average, with 4 home runs and 37 runs batted in (RBIs). It was the first season during which he played in more than 100 games, appearing in 119, all at second base. In 2012, he split time between the Reading Phillies and Lehigh Valley IronPigs, the Phillies Double-A (AA) and Triple-A (AAA) affiliates respectively, combining to hit .291 with 2 home runs and 57 RBIs, stealing 21 bases. He was an Eastern League all star for his performance with Reading, earning his call-up to Lehigh Valley in August.
Teetering on the brink (2013-present).
Hernandez began the season in AAA, but in May, Michael Young was placed on bereavement leave, and subsequently, Hernandez was promoted to the major leagues to fill Young's roster spot. On May 29, he made his debut, pinch hitting for Antonio Bastardo. Shortly after, he was optioned to AAA. With the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs, he was named to the all-star team. In July 2013, when Ben Revere sustained an injury, he was converted to a center fielder, a conversion he made quickly and effectively, garnering a call-up to the big leagues, as he was a "pleasant surprise". His manager, Dave Brundage, commented, "He’s done very well offensively and now they’re trying to see if we can create a spot or find a spot and see if it’s a fit or not." While with the big-league club, Hernandez played in 34 games, amassing a .289 batting average and a .344 on-base percentage to go along with 10 RBIs – he hit no home runs.
After the season, Hernandez traveled to his native Venezuela to play for the Venezuelan Winter League Bravos de Margarita, with whom he posted a .254 batting average, 2 home runs, and 15 RBIs; he stopped playing prior to the end of the season to rest prior to Phillies Spring training. He had played with Bravos de Margarita in the winter since the 2010 season. Entering the 2014 season, Hernandez drew comparisons to fellow reserve Freddy Galvis. While Galvis could play shortstop and had experience in the corner outfield positions, Hernandez could play center field and was a natural second baseman, and with Chase Utley's frequent injuries, he would likely see time there. Both players were expected to see significant time with the big-league team, predominantly due to the established core – players such as Utley, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins – being relatively old (in 2013, the Phillies average age was 28.4, the third-oldest in the Major Leagues) and injury prone over the preceding several seasons, leaving ample playing time for replacements such as Hernandez, especially considering the fact that he would be able to continue his development in the minor leagues after MLB granted the Phillies a fourth option year, essentially meaning that they could keep him in the minor leagues during the season without him having to clear waivers. Ultimately, he began the season on the major league roster, but was sent down to Reading (AA) in April to focus on honing his defensive skills at third base and shortstop.
Personal.
Hernandez was born in Valencia, Carabobo, Venezuela, where he also resides in the offseason. Phillies' scouts Sal Agostinelli and Jesus Mendez signed him on July 2, 2006 at age 16.

2002 Football League Second Division play-off Final

The 2002 Football League Second Division play-off Final was a football match played at Millennium Stadium on 11 May 2002, at the end of the 2001–02 season. It was the 16th play-off final in all at the third level of English football. The match determined the third and final team to gain promotion from the Second Division to the First Division, and was contested by Brentford, who had finished third during the league season, and Stoke City, who had finished fifth. Stoke won the encounter 2–0 and thus gained promotion thanks to goals from Deon Burton and an own goal from Ben Burgess.
Route to the final.
Brentford under the guidance of Steve Coppell finished 3rd in the Second Division just one point away from 2nd place Reading whom they played on the final day of the season. The "Bees" took the lead through Martin Rowlands just after half time and it looked as if it would be enough to see them promoted by a late strike from Jamie Cureton ended a dramatic promotion race. Stoke City went into the 2001–02 season looking to again automatic promotion after two failed attempts to win the play-offs losing to Gillingham and Walsall. Stoke had a poor run of form at the turn of the year and in the end had to settle for 5th position.
Brentford were paired against Huddersfield Town and after a 0–0 draw away Brentford won 2–1 at Griffin Park. Stoke played Cardiff City and lost the first leg 2–1 at home which did not bode well travelling to the notoriously hostile Ninian Park. After 90 minutes the match was 0–0 and with Cardiff preparing their celebrations James O'Connor scored in the last minute to send the match into extra time. Stoke completed a dramatic victory with O'Connor's shot deflecting in off Souleymane Oulare who was making his 2nd and final appearance for Stoke.
Match review.
After Stoke had failed to gain promotion via the play-offs for two seasons running they were clear favourites to make it third time lucky. Stoke controlled the match from the start and took a 16th minute lead via on loan striker Deon Burton. Stoke then scored again just before half time a Bjarni Guðjónsson free-kick was sliced into his own net by Ben Burgess to give Stoke a 2–0 lead. In the second half Brentford failed to mount a comeback and Stoke eased to victory and a return to the second tier for the first time since 1998. The victory was not enough however to earn manager Gudjon Thordarson a new contract.

Lighthouse Beach

Lighthouse Beach is a small section of the Fire Island National Seashore that is adjacent to Robert Moses State Park. It was notable for having sections that are officially designated as clothing optional. It is named for the nearby Lighthouse and was the largest recognized clothing optional beach in New York. On Feb 5, 2013, the Fire Island National Seashore announced its plan to begin enforcing New York State anti-nudity laws on all Fire Island beaches, including Lighthouse Beach, possibly ending clothing optional usage.
The beach is approximately long and can be defined as the ocean facing beach between Robert Moses State Park and the community of Kismet. Technically, it is in the Town of Islip.
History.
There are some reports of nudists using the beach as far back as World War II, getting to the island by rowboat. After the Robert Moses Causeway was extended to Fire Island in 1964, word slowly spread, resulting in the clothing optional usage expanding greatly in the 1970s.
Originally, the entire stretch of beach was clothing optional, however there have been some complaints from users objecting to the nudity going back to the 1980s. These complaints were largely from parents who visited the lighthouse and were surprised by the nudity on the beach.
In 1994, due to negotiations between Friends of Lighthouse Beach and the National Park Service, the center section was made non-clothing optional or textile so that visitors from the lighthouse who did not want to see nudity could enjoy the beach.
Access.
Since there is no vehicular traffic permitted in the Seashore, visitors must come in from the Robert Moses State Park in the west or the community of Kismet in the east. There is currently no handicapped access to the beach. In the past, there were accessible ramps from the westernmost boardwalk, but these have been destroyed by winter storms and have not yet been replaced.
New York State officials estimate that about 30% of the users of RMSP Field 5 avail themselves of the Lighthouse Beach and the Lighthouse itself.
There is signage on the beach at the start of each clothing optional section to alert unsuspecting visitors that "Beyond this point, you may encounter nude sunbathers."
As of February 5, 2013, Lighthouse Beach is no longer clothing optional. Bathing suits are required at all times, and park police have been observed patrolling the beach and issuing citations to nude sunbathers. Note that in New York State, women are legally permitted to be topless and continue to do so at this beach.
The beach is widely regarded as family friendly.
Services.
There are very limited services at this beach. There are no lifeguards or concessions. There are no trash receptacles making it a Carry in, Carry out facility. As with the rest of the Seashore, law enforcement is provided by National Park Service Rangers with occasional visits from the Suffolk County Police. At least two volunteer organizations work to ensure users are aware of appropriate behavior.

CZ 75 Tactical Sports

Facts.
The Czech-made CZ 75 Tactical Sports pistol is a single-action firearm specifically designed for practical shooting competitions. It is the successor of the CZ 75 Standard IPSC model. Though almost identical in external appearance, the TS features some improvements, especially in its trigger mechanism, magazine capacity and durability.
Originally, the CZ 75 IPSC models were manufactured in versions for two IPSC practical shooting divisions: Modified (the 75 M IPSC) and Standard (the 75 ST IPSC). Currently, there are no CZ models available for Modified Division. Recently CZ introduced the CZ 75 TS Czechmate a competition variant based on the Tactical Sports 9mm model; equipped with a compensator and electronic red dot sight on a frame mount; designed especially for IPSC Open Division.
The CZ 75 TS comes in two calibers: .40 S&W (17 cartridges in the magazine) and 9mm (20 cartridges in the magazine). The .40 S&W caliber offers a score advantage by considering a higher or “major” caliber (according to the IPSC rules). However, the 9mm model is appealing to shooters who do not reload their ammo and in countries where the law does not allow the use of major calibers, as well as for those who want to take advantage of the low recoil and very high magazine capacity of the 9mm version.
CZ Custom has marketed a magazine extender for the .40 S&W version that increases capacity from 17 to 20 cartridges, but with this accessory the pistol is no longer legal in IPSC Standard Division, though it is eligible for USPSA Limited Division.

Pillars of the Sky is an American western film in Technicolor and CinemaScope, released by Universal-International on October 12, 1956. Directed by George Marshall, it stars Jeff Chandler and Dorothy Malone, with co-stars Ward Bond, Keith Andes and Lee Marvin.
Plot.
Oregon Country 1868: Indian natives of many tribes trust Sgt. Emmett Bell, who rides into Dr. Joseph Holden's mission with his scouts. But troop and weapon movement by new U.S. Cavalry commanding officer Col. Steadlow has endangered the peace and angered the chiefs, in particular one called Kamiakin.
An outraged Bell tries to appeal to Steadlow as well as Capt. Tom Gaxton, whose wife Calla was once in love with him. Calla and another woman are taken captive and are rescued with Bell, rekinding their romance.
Cavalry soldiers are massacred by the Indians, and appeals for a truce go in vain. But a particularly bloodthirsty act by Kamiakin results in his being killed by one of his own, whereupon Bell and the chiefs agree to do whatever's necessary to restore the peace.
Production.
The film was partly shot on location in Oregon over six weeks. At one stage it was announced the film was going to be directed by John Ford and star John Wayne.
Evaluation in film guides.
"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide" gives "Pillars of the Sky" 2½ stars (out of 4) in a one-sentence write-up which states that "Chandler is apt as swaggering army officer...", with "Steven H. Scheuer's Movies on TV" also arriving at the 2½ stars (out of 4) rating, deciding that "Western fans will buy this tale of a no-account, hard-drinking, woman-chasing Sgt. who finally sees the error of his ways..."
"The Motion Picture Guide" makes it unanimous (among the three cited sources), with its 2½-star (out of 5) description of the production as "a relatively satisfying cowboys and Indians film starring Chandler as a cavalry scout who is literally a voice in the wilderness..." and, in conclusion, adds, "ood cast. The outdoor location shooting was done in Oregon".

Plot.
Matt Campbell arrives in Kenya, where his brother George is reported missing. A man named Ralph Hoyt tells him that George has been killed by members of the "Leopard Men" cult.
Matt is introduced to Hoyt's niece, Ann Wilson, an anthropologist, who is puzzled by Matt's reluctance to go to Mombasa for his brother's funeral. Matt also meets big-game hunter Gil Rossi, who was helping George search for a valuable uranium mine. Hoyt claims the mine doesn't exist.
Another business partner, Elliott Hastings, claims that George's body has been cremated but he did find a map. An expedition beyond Mombasa is formed, guided by Ketimi and other local tribesmen. A shared experience with a charge of hippos brings Matt and Ann closer together, while Gil is nearly killed by an alligator before it is shot by Hastings.
Tribesmen wearing leopard disguises attack Hastings that night. Ketimi is then killed by a poison dart, causing the other tribesmen to leave. Locating a shaft to the mine, Matt and Ann are lowered into it. She discovers to her horror that Hoyt, her uncle, has murdered Gil with a blow gun. Hoyt confesses to killing Ketimi and paying other natives to disguise themselves as the mythical Leopard Men.
Matt and Ann are about to become the next victims, but Ketimi's fellow tribesmen reappear and take their revenge.

Crestwood Public Library

Crestwood Public Library is located in the village of Crestwood, Illinois, a south suburb of Chicago.
The Crestwood Public Library was first located at the old Willow Creek School in District 129. The Willow Creek School was popular in the early 1900s, holding many elementary school graduations, but had become abandoned and neglected as the years passed. In 1969, the building was leased from School District 130, and renovated with the help of a number of volunteers and generous donations from the Village businessmen and organizations. The building was officially dedicated by Lt. Governor Paul Simon and operated by the Village residents. Known as “The Little School House,” it served as the Village library until January 16, 1973 when 2/3 of the building and a total of 4,000 books were destroyed due to a suspected act of arson. The library reopened two more times following the fire: once in November 1973 in the Public Works Building, and a second time in April 1974 in the Council Chambers in the Crestwood Village Hall. It remained there for a period of time until it moved once again to a more established location on 135th street between Central Avenue and Cicero Avenue in August 1987. The first renovation and expansion of this building was completed in January 1995. There are, however, current plans to make more renovation and expansion changes to the library in 2011. 
The Crestwood Public Library is a member of the Metropolitan Library System and enables registered patrons to borrow books, films, music, and other materials. There are also a variety of programs for children and families to participate in and attend.

Underground hangar

An underground hangar is a type of hangar for military aircraft, usually dug into the side of a mountain for protection. It is bigger and more protected than a hardened aircraft shelter (HAS).
An underground hangar complex may include tunnels containing the normal elements of a military airbase - fuel storage, weapon storage, rooms for maintaining the aircraft systems, a communications centre, briefing rooms, kitchen, dining rooms, sleeping areas and generators for electrical power.
Countries that have used underground hangars include Albania, China, India, Pakistan, Italy, North Korea, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Vietnam and Yugoslavia.
By country.
India.
The Indian Air Force operates underground hangars. Sukhoi Su-30 MKI have been stationed at Trishul Air-base situated in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India. It houses one of the largest underground hangars in Asia. Adampur, situated in Punjab, houses an air-base with underground hangars. It is the home base for MiG-29 and MiG-21 interceptors.
Pakistan.
Pakistan has an underground hangar facility for the Pakistan Air Force at PAF Base Mushaf, Sargodha, Punjab.
Sweden.
In 1941 the Swedish Air Force began building its first underground hangar at F 9 Säve, located near Gothenburg in south-west Sweden, it was commissioned in 1943. After World War II plans were made up for building underground hangars at every air force base witch hade suitable rock conditions. These ambitious building plans proved to be too expensive and was reduced to just build hangars at certain selected air bases. A second underground hangar was built in 1947 at F 18 Tullinge which began operating in 1950. After that planes were finalized for building under ground hangars capable of surviving close hits by Tactical nuclear weapons. To achieve this required that these new hangars would be much deeper, with 25 to 30 meters of rock cover, and heavy-duty blast doors in concrete. The Saab 37 Viggen aircraft was designed with a folding tail fin to fit into low hangars. One of the hangars is now the Aeroseum museum.
Switzerland.
Six "Flugzeugkaverne" (aircraft caverns), each with space for 30 or more aircraft, were constructed for the Swiss Air Force. One has been used to operate F/A-18 Hornet aircraft.
Yugoslavia.
The largest underground hangar complex in former Yugoslavia was at Željava Airport near Bihać, with enough space for 80 MiG-21s. Slatina Air Base, located at Pristina International Airport, contained the second largest.
Taiwan.
The only Taiwanese airbase where has built underground hangars is Jiashan Airbase, located in Hualien at Eastern Taiwan coast, to prevent from massive missile strike launched from China. Underground hangars in Jiashan Airbase has deployed F-16 A/B, F-5 E-F squadrons.

Former Fire Hall No. 3

The Former Fire Hall No. 3 is a municipal designated historic building located in the Nutana neighborhood of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. 
With the University of Saskatchewan being built on the east side of the river this enhanced the need for a new fire hall on the east side. Built in 1911 with the latest equipment and both horse drawn and gasoline-powered fire fighting equipment the facility was again modernised in 1926.. In 1958 the fire department left the facility for a new Fire Hall #3 that was constructed on York Avenue and Taylor Street. 
As a result of the cold war in 1959, the building became the headquarters for the Department of Civil Defense; the basement was converted into a radiation-proof communications bunker, and an emergency food kitchen was also built to be used in the event of nuclear war. 
Today the building is privately owned and houses a bar and restaurant.

Kenny Laguna

Kenneth Benjamin "Kenny" Laguna (born January 30, 1954) is an American songwriter and record producer, best known for his work with Joan Jett.
He was born in Greenwich Village, New York City, and started playing piano at high school dances from the age of twelve. In the late 1960s he worked as a songwriter and producer with Super K Productions, established at Buddah Records by producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffrey Katz, writing songs for such acts as Tony Orlando, The Ohio Express and The Lemon Pipers, often in association with writers Bo Gentry, Bobby Bloom and Ritchie Cordell. Laguna played keyboards for a time with Tommy James and the Shondells, and played on their 1968 hit single "Mony Mony"; he also played keyboards on the second Ohio Express album, "Yummy Yummy". Some other credits that Kenny Laguna can be seen on include playing on and singing backgrounds for Simon Says, Goody Goody Gumdrops, Indian Give, and most of the 1910 Fruitgum Company's record 1 2 3 Red Light, playing on "Gimmee Gimmee Good Lovin" by the Crazy Elephant, The Lemon Pipers' "Green Tambourine", as well as "This Magic Moment" and "Walkin' in the Rain" by Jay and the Americans.
One of his most successful writing credits was for "Groovin' With Mr Bloe", originally a throwaway B-side for Tony Orlando's group Wind. The tune was covered in the UK by studio musicians calling themselves Mr. Bloe, and reached #2 on the UK singles chart in 1970; the original version was reissued, credited to Cool Heat, and scraped into the US chart. Laguna also worked on the soundtrack of the Andy Warhol film "Lonesome Cowboys", and worked as a producer in Los Angeles with singers Darlene Love and Bill Medley, formerly of The Righteous Brothers. He played or sang on more than 50 "Billboard" Top 40 hits by 1972.
In the mid 1970s he worked for a time in Britain, and produced a series of albums with the Steve Gibbons Band, as well as their UK hit single "Tulane", a cover of a Chuck Berry song. He also worked in Los Angeles, as a writer and producer for Beserkley Records, on songs by and for Jonathan Richman, Greg Kihn, Earth Quake and others. With Earth Quake and label boss Matthew "King" Kaufman, he recorded a version of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven", rewritten with the lyrics to the theme song of the television show "Gilligan's Island". The record was issued as a single, by Little Roger and the Goosebumps, but the label was threatened with legal action by Led Zeppelin's lawyers and copies were destroyed. It was eventually reissued in 2000 on the compilation CD "Laguna Tunes".
Laguna met, and began working with, Joan Jett, shortly after the break-up of The Runaways in 1979. Working with Cordell and others, he won her a solo record deal and co-produced her solo albums including "Bad Reputation" (1980), and "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" (1981). He established Blackheart Records with Jett in the early 1980s. In 1982 he also produced English band Bow Wow Wow's hit version of "I Want Candy". He has continued to work with Joan Jett, as performer, producer and manager, on her later albums and tours, and acted as Executive Producer on the 2010 film "The Runaways", about Jett's earlier band.

<doc id="31165479" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31165479" title="Oligopeptidase">
Oligopeptidase

Oligopeptidase is an enzyme that cleaves peptides but not proteins, a property that is due to its structure: the active site of this enzyme is located at the end of a narrow cavity which can only be reached by peptides. These oligopeptides, peptides, predominantely smaller than 30 amino acids in length, play essential roles as hormones, in the surveillance against pathogens, and in neurological activities. Therefore these molecules constantly need to be specifically generated and inactivated, which is the role of the oligopeptidases. Oligopeptidase is a term coined in 1979 to designate a sub-group of the endopeptidases, which are not involved in the digestion nor in the processing of proteins like the pancreatic enzymes, proteasomes, cathepsins among many others. The prolyl-oligopeptidase or prolyl endopeptidase (POP) is a good example of how an oligopeptidase interacts with and metabolizes an oligopeptide. The peptide has first to penetrate into a 4 Å hole on the surface of the enzyme in order to reach an 8,500Å3 internal cavity, where the active site is located. The activity of the oligopeptidase is rather selective, as experimental evidence demonstrated. They suggest that the oligopeptide should display specific structures in order to access the active site of the enzyme. This peculiar mechanism of action sets the oligopeptidases at the end of the protein processing pathway, acting on specific oligopeptides, allowing them to play essential physiological and pathological roles, from microorganisms to man. 
Historical Background.
Autolysis:Proteins are essential macromolecules of living organisms. They are continuously being degraded into their constituent amino acids which can be reused in the synthesis of new proteins. Every cellular protein has its own half-life time. In humans, for instance, 50% of the liver and plasma proteins are replaced in 10 days, whereas in muscles it takes 180 days. In average, every 80 days about 50% of our proteins are totally replaced. Although the regulation of the protein degradation is as important as their synthesis to keep each cell protein concentration at the optimum level, this research area remained neglected until the end of the 1970s. Up to this time, lysosomes, discovered in the 1950s by the Belgian cytologist Christian de Duve were held responsible for the complete digestion of intra- and extracellular proteins by the lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes.
Limited proteolysis: Between the 1970s and 1980s, this view drastically changed. New experimental evidences showed that, under physiological conditions, non-lysosomal proteases were responsible for limited proteolysis of intra- and/or extracellular proteins, a concept originally conceived by Linderstᴓm-Lang in 1950. Endogenous or exogenous proteins are processed by non-lysosomal proteases into intermediate-sized polypeptides, which display gene and metabolic regulation, neurologic, endocrine, and immunological roles, whose dysfunction might explain a number of pathologies. Consequently, protein degradation did not represent anymore the end of the biological function of proteins, but rather the beginning of a yet unexplored side of the biology of the cells. A number of intra- or extracellular proteases release protein fragments endowed with essential biological activities. These hydrolytic processes could be carried out by proteases such as Proteasomes, Proprotein Convertases, Caspases, Rennin and Kallikreins. Among the products released by the non-lysosomal proteases are the bioactive oligopeptides such as hormones, neuropeptides and epitopes that, once released, could be modulated in their biological activities by specific peptidases, which promote the trimming, conversion and/or inactivation of the bioactive oligopeptides.
The history of oligopeptidases originates in the late 1960s, when the rabbit brain was searched for enzymes that cause inactivation of the nonapeptide bradykinin. In the early and mid 1970s two thiol-activated endopeptidases, responsible for more than 90% of bradykinin inactivation, were isolated from cytosol of rabbit brain, and characterized. They correspond to EOPA (endooligopeptidase A, EC 3.4.22.19), and Prolyl endopeptidase or Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) (EC 3.4.21.26). Since their activities are restricted to oligopeptides (usually from 8-13 amino acid residues), and do not hydrolyze proteins or large peptides (>30 amino acid residues), they were designated oligopeptidases. In the early and mid 1980s other oligopeptidases, mostly metallopeptidases, were described in the cytosol of mammalian tissues, such as the TOP (thimet oligopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.15), and the neurolysin (EC 3.4.24.16). Earlier on, the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme, EC 3.4.15.1), and the NEP (neprilysin, EC 3.4.24.11), had been described, at the end of the 1960s, respectively.
Function and clinical significance.
Since the discovery of the neuropeptides and peptide hormones from the central nervous system (ACTH, β-MSH, endorphin, oxytocin, vasopressin, LHRH, enkephalins, substance P), and of peripheral vasoactive peptides (angiotensin, bradykinin) around the middle of last century, the number of biologically active peptides has exponentially increased. They are signaling molecules, participating in all essential aspects of life, from physiological homeostasis (as neuropeptides, peptide hormones, vasoactive peptides), to immunological defense (as MHC class I and II, cytokinins), and as regulatory peptides displaying more than a single action. These peptides result from partial proteolysis of intracellular or extracellular protein precursors performed by several processing enzymes or protease complexes (rennin, kallikreins, calpains, prohormone convertases, proteasomes, endosomes, lysosomes), which convert proteins into peptides, including those with biological activities. The resulting protein fragments of various sizes are either readily degraded into free amino acids, or captured by oligopeptidases, whose peculiar binding and/or catalytic properties allow them to fulfill their physiological roles by trimming inactive peptide precursors leading to their active form, converting bioactive peptides into novel ones., inactivating them, thus restraining the continuous activation of specific receptors, or protecting the newly generated bioactive peptide from further degradation, suggesting a peptide chaperon-like activity. TOP, a ubiquitous cytosolic oligopeptidase, is a remarkable example of how this enzyme could play an essential role in immune defense against cancer cells. It has also been successfully used as a hook to fish novel bioactive peptides from cytosol of cells.
The involvement of peptides in cell-cell interactions and in neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, and neurovegetative diseases are waiting for peptidomics and gene silencing approaches, which will expedite the formation of new concepts in an emerging era for oligopeptidases.
The participation of oligopeptidases in a number of pathologies has long been reported. The ACE has benefited the most from a thorough knowledge on the enzyme structure and its mechanism of catalysis leading to the better understanding of its role in cardiovascular pathologies and therapeutics. Accordingly, for over 30 years, the treatment of human arterial hypertension has taken advantage of ACE inhibition by active site-directed inhibitors like captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and others. b) NEP has been involved in cancer; c) the TOP has been involved in tuberculosis and in cancer; d) the EOPA or NUDEL/EOPA (NDEL1/EOPA gene product) has been involved in neuronal migration during the cortex formation in human embryo (lissencephaly) and neurite outgrowth in adults, as in schizophrenia. Coincidentally, an activity related to the development of nervous tissue has been suggested for POP, nevertheless not involving its proteolytic activity.

Femme Fatale Tour

Femme Fatale Tour was the eighth concert tour by American recording artist Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her seventh studio album "Femme Fatale" (2011). It was officially announced in March 2011, with dates for North American venues revealed. The tour was initially planned as a co-headlining tour with Enrique Iglesias, but he canceled only hours after the announcement. The show is inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. The setlist was mostly composed by songs from her Femme Fatale album, although she included hits from previous albums for the fans. Fashion designer Zaldy Goco created the costumes. In July 2011, Spears announced plans of playing a South American leg in territories she either had never been to or had not played for a long time. Spears has named the Femme Fatale Tour the best show from her career.
The tour, divided in five segments, portrays a story in which Spears is a secret agent, who is chased by a stalker named Tormento Lancie; played by Rudolf Martin. The first section features her escaping from prison along with other female inmates. The second segment displays upbeat dance numbers and ends with a performance inspired by Marilyn Monroe. The third section features an Egyptian theme with fireworks and acrobatics. The fourth segment displays energetic routines and motorcycle costumes. The encore begins with a video interlude of Spears capturing the stalker, and is followed by two performances in which she defeats a group of ninjas.
The Femme Fatale Tour received positive to mixed reviews from critics. Some described it as her most entertaining show yet and praised Spears's performance, while others criticized her dancing and lack of interaction. The Femme Fatale Tour grossed $6.2 million in the first ten shows, and was included on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list.
An unofficial high-quality recording of the Las Vegas show was leaked onto YouTube in July 2011; it was removed after the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) filed legal action against the site to obtain information on the uploader. 3ality Digital filmed a special of the tour during the Toronto shows in August 2011 in 2D and 3D. The special, titled "", aired on Epix in the United States. BBC Worldwide acquired the rights to both 2D and 3D versions outside the United States. Worldwide, the Femme Fatale Tour was the eleventh highest-grossing tour of 2011, with a gross of $68.7 million. 697,957 fans attended the shows worldwide, with an average attendance of 8,724, paying an average of $98.43.
Background.
In an interview on Ryan Seacrest's radio show on March 4, 2011, Spears stated she would tour the United States in the "early summer" in support of "Femme Fatale". On March 29, 2011, following her performances on "Good Morning America", she announced a co-headlining tour with Enrique Iglesias, starting in June 2011. Hours after the announcement, it was reported by "Billboard" that Iglesias had pulled out of the tour. Ray Wedell of "Billboard" speculated that the reason may have been that Spears was deemed by news outlets as the headliner, while Iglesias was considered the opening act. The first twenty-six North American dates were also announced on March 29, 2011. The opening acts were announced on April 12, 2011. Spears stated, "This is the Femme Fatale tour and I'm thrilled to have Nicki Minaj, Jessie and the Toy Boys, and Nervo join me and get everyone on the dance floor. Can't wait to take the Femme Fatales on the road." Tickets for select markets went on sale on April 30, 2011, at ticket seller Ticketmaster and tour promoter Live Nation's websites.
In May 2011, it was announced that Spears would headline Summerfest on July 9, 2011, at the Marcus Amphitheater in Milwaukee. She previously headlined the festival on July 8, 2000, during the Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, and had to cancel her performance during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004 due to a knee injury. Summerfest's entertainment director Bob Babisch said, "It's going to be a great dance party. [...] This is going to be the biggest production we've ever put in the Marcus Amphitheatre. There's a thrust that goes out on the stage about 80 feet, and it's about 80 feet wide, and there's all kinds of things flying in and out." The European tour dates were announced on her official website on June 5, 2011. On July 25, 2011, Spears announced through her Ustream page at 18:00 EST (23:00 UTC) a South American leg of the tour. Accompanied by two of her dancers — one translating in Spanish and the other in Portuguese — she also apologized for not touring in the region during The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009. A notice following the stream announced the first two dates in Brazil and ten more dates to be announced in the near future. It will mark Spears first concert in Brazil in ten years, since her 2001 performance at Rock in Rio. During the next few days, concerts in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru were announced. On September 26, 2011, it was announced that Spears would perform on the first day of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Development.
In March 2011, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph told MTV News that the tour would have a "post-apocalyptic vibe", and commented that "Till The World Ends" "keeps becoming a theme for us." He also confirmed Jamie King as the tour director and Brian Friedman as the choreographer. The following month, Friedman announced that he had pulled out of the tour due to scheduling conflicts with his own reality series. In a video interview posted on Spears's official website, she said, "The Femme Fatale Tour will hopefully just be outrageously spectacular. I'm just hoping that the choreographers will come up with just the most outrageous things, and I'm really excited. This is one of the most excited I've been about a project in a really long time, so I can't wait." The script of the show was created by Jamie King, and was inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. Rudolph stated that the idea for the show was to have Spears as an "international woman of mystery". The setlist was composed mostly of songs from "Femme Fatale", but also included hits from her previous albums, as Spears explained, "The fans really like a lot of the old songs, because that's what they are used to. So it's just about finding the balance, and how many songs I wanna incorporate from the past and from the present."
The costume design was done by Zaldy Goco, and the outfits were created to fit the different personas of Spears throughout the show. He also commented that the inspiration for the costumes was "Britney herself [...] She's a very sexy girl." Among the outfits that Goco previewed to "Extra" prior to the beginning of the tour were a pink latex jacket, a nude bodysuit, a Marilyn Monroe-inspired white flowing dress, several gladiator-inspired gold-mirrored options, pink-chrome-studded leather and denim, as well as a "Toxic"-inspired catsuit. For the finale, she was revealed to wear a kimono, with an anime version of herself silk-screened on one sleeve, over a sparkling, black bodysuit with LED lights built into it. On April 30, 2011, a video of Spears rehearsing "How I Roll" from "Femme Fatale" with her dancers surfaced online. On May 11, 2011, Sabi spoke to MTV News at a St. Bernard Project dinner hosted by Spears, stating that she would join her during the performances of "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" at select dates such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York. On June 7, 2011, a video surfaced online of Spears seeing the stage for the first time, along with a soundcheck of the music and staging for "Hold It Against Me". According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, the stage "has it all: lights, video screens, a funky neon-colored floor, lasers, lifts and giant butterfly wings." In an interview with "Entertainment Tonight" on June 8, 2011, Spears said about the show,
"I'm really excited. I'm probably going to be extra nervous the day before. We've been working hard for, like, two months now, and everything's coming together really good. [...] show can be kind of , especially when you're onstage and you're on your eighth number, you get really winded and you're like, 'How can I do the rest of the show?' But I've been training for a while and I actually — before I come to rehearsals — I've been working out and stuff like that so I won't have that predicament."
After Minaj was announced as the opening act in April 2011, she said on Ryan Seacrest's radio show she was looking forward to creating "a new, a bigger, a brighter, a more spectacular show." She stated that as much as her set was about the music, she wanted to put more theater on stage, saying, "my goal to truly put on a show and incorporate theater and dance." The hair and make-up was done by Marco Berardini, who was inspired by European women such as Brigitte Bardot. "It's the epitome of a strong woman. I wanted to bring out that strength and sexiness for all the girls on tour", he said. He applied Spears with makeup and designed it to "be a little bit neutral so that it could work with anything." As for the hair, it was changed at every show to fit the vibe of the city. For example, at the Uniondale show on August 2, 2011, Spears sported wavy hair, inspired by Sarah Jessica Parker and the street style of New York women.
BuzzFeed reported that 23 18-wheeler trucks arrived at each venue at 5 a.m. on show day. It took 7 hours to unload and build the stage. Unlike most tours who built the stage from the bottom up, the stage was built from the ceiling down. The tour comprised 140 workers, 125 crew members, 14 tour buses, 16 dancers and 2 band members. In July 2011, Spears told MTV News she was having "a blast" on the tour, commenting, "The shows have been equally amazing. The crowds have been so good each night and that gives you the adrenaline you need to get through the show. It just pumps you up." She also talked about the performance of "Till the World Ends", saying that "at the end of the show, the last song comes on every once . Not every show, but it's usually special when she does it." In an interview with "Glamour" in October 2011, Spears said: "I seriously think it's the best tour I've done so far. [... right now I’m really excited about the show – this is the funnest show I've done in my career."
Concert synopsis.
After a neon sign reading "Femme Fatale" is lifted from the stage, the show begins with a video introduction in which Spears is arrested by the police after a chasing sequence. As she says "I'm not that innocent", the video screens part and she appears sitting on a metallic throne in a silver costume to perform "Hold It Against Me". She is accompanied by her back-up dancers in white and silver costumes. "Up N' Down" features Spears and her female dancers performing inside cages, with the male dancers looking at them dressed as policemen. After walking to the B-stage in a conveyor belt, Spears puts on a white trench coat and a satin fedora to perform "3". She then goes into "Piece of Me" while floating above the stage in a platform. This is followed by a video intermission that contains the beginning of the music video for "My Prerogative", and in which a stalker reveals that Spears is a secret agent. The next section begins with Spears in a pink latex and lace jacket emerging from inside a bass to perform "Big Fat Bass", while will.i.am appears in the backdrops. She removes the jacket to reveal a nude leotard for the performance of "How I Roll", which features a pink convertible Mini Cooper-like car and her dancers wearing colorful outfits. This is followed by a segment in which Spears and her dancers select a male member from the audience. She then bursts into "Lace and Leather" and performs sensually for him. After a costume change, Spears goes into the song "If U Seek Amy" while wearing a white skirt over a fan, recalling Marilyn Monroe's iconic scene in "The Seven Year Itch" (1955).
A video interlude in which the stalker talks about femme fatales in history sees the beginning of the third section. Spears returns to the stage wearing a golden outfit and performs an Egyptian-inspired version of "Gimme More", containing a barge and fireworks. In her next number "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" Spears is surrounded by her dancers carrying picture frames, and includes an appearance by Sabi in select cities. She then sings "He About to Lose Me" on a purple couch while her male dancers climb metallic structures. She wears a golden cape for a snake charming number of "Boys" (The Co-Ed Remix). After climbing into a swing, she starts singing "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", while an acrobat hangs from it. Another video interlude follows, featuring Spears changing clothes and choosing between different passports inside a hotel room. The final segment features Spears and her dancers dressed in motorcycle gear to perform a medley of "...Baby One More Time" and "S&M", while her next number "Trouble for Me" features Spears and her dancers performing in the B-stage. Accompanied by her female dancers, Spears performs "I'm a Slave 4 U" with gay soft porn in the backdrops, and subsequently a cover of Madonna's "Burning Up" on top of a giant silver guitar. She then brings several fans onstage for a performance of "I Wanna Go". She sings "Womanizer" with her dancers dressed as policemen and thanks the audience. The encore starts with a video interlude in which Spears finally captures the stalker while wearing a kimono. She reappears to perform a martial arts-inspired version of "Toxic", in which she defeats a group of ninjas. At the end of the song, she goes below the stage and returns wearing a black sparkly bodysuit for "Till the World Ends". Halfway through the performance, Nicki Minaj appears on the backdrops rapping her verse of The Femme Fatale Remix of the song. She also joined Spears to perform the verse in select cities. After the song changes back to the original version, Spears starts flying in a platform with giant angel wings. The show ends with Spears and her dancers thanking the audience, as confetti falls and the "Femme Fatale" sign is lowered onstage.
Critical response.
Barry Walters from "Rolling Stone" called the show "possibly her flashiest, fastest moving, and most entertaining production yet", and added that the night belonged to Spears, as "she managed to prove that she's still progressing as a showgirl. Not only that, she's doing it better than even diehard defenders would’ve predicted. At 29, the pop star whose career seemed in danger of ending just a couple years ago has shown that she's back – hopefully this time to stay." Evelyn McDonnell of "Spin" said that "the idol America loves to hate went all out. Her body perpetually moved, she sang steadfastly into her headset (okay, she's got plenty of digital support, but she doesn't merely lip-sync), and she shimmied through an endless parade of outfits. [...] Having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years, Spears is now desperately seeking our attention. And she earns it. Haters go home." Kelley L. Carter of MTV commented that "the Spears that captivated the audience at the Staples Center [...] was the old, fun-loving, free-wheeling Spears — with a sexy, showgirl twist. There wasn't much pretense, though those glamazon outfits blinded in the best way possible. Instead, there was just good dance music." Carla Meyer of "The Sacramento Bee" stated that "Though Spears performed like a pro throughout the show, hitting all her marks, she had shown hesitancy in her movements — natural for the first stop on a tour. But that hesitancy vanished when she put on the denim. She seemed at ease."
Shaunna Murphy of "Entertainment Weekly" criticized "Britney's complete lack of verbal audience interaction [...] and her obviously diminished dancing ability" but also added that "with her slim waist, her dangerously toned legs, and most importantly her engaged, wide-eyed smile, looked happy to be there with us—the crucial element that has been missing from so many Britney shows of late." August Brown of the "Los Angeles Times" stated that "the Femme Fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing — or at least tweaking — the past. [... Spears manipulates pop’s virgin-whore complex better than just about anyone, and her seamless sweep from lasciviously grinding on an awestruck dude from the audience to the earnest balladry of 'Don’t Let Me Be the Last to Know' [...] felt true to the sweep of her career — she learned that she can control the narrative by vanishing into a club's heat or into literal thin air." Matt Kivel of "Variety" commented, "Though visually impressive, the show lacked a truly engaging human quality. Spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment, lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself. With her voice heavily processed and laden with backing tracks, she appeared onstage as some strange blend of Michael Jackson, Madonna and Kraftwerk's Ralf and Florian." However, "Jam! Canoe" considered the show "best described as Janet Jackson-like."
Steve Palopoli of "Metro Silicon Valley" said, "Musically, the show is heavy on the hits, although considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna's albums is best. She's a cultural phenomenon, obviously, and the only edicts that seem to have been handed down in regards to the music is 'no lip-synching' (she definitely doesn't) and 'bigger and louder whenever possible.'" Shirley Halperin of "The Hollywood Reporter" stated it was "entertaining", but Spears "doesn’t quite have that spring in her dance step anymore and who requires a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits". Jim Harrington of the "Oakland Tribune" deemed the show as "a mess pretty much from start to finish. The theatrics are awkward and confusing, the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat, the song selection is weak and misguided, and Britney's star power, so blinding on tours past, is remarkably dim." Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" gave the show two stars out of five, saying that "there's a suspicion that the kind of person who goes to see Britney Spears live isn't really there for the music or her sparkling personality: tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever. What they're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity." Neil McCormick of "The Daily Telegraph" gave the show one star out of five, and called it "the saddest, laziest, dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed." He added that "the most amazing thing about the whole second-rate spectacle was that thousands of people, having forked out around £50 a head for tickets, practically raised the roof, cheering every dismal dance move, roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica."
Commercial reception.
Live Nation announced in early May 2011 a partnership with deal-of-the-day website Groupon. A spokesperson explained, "Offering a deal on Groupon is not a reflection of the quality or status or sales of a show" but rather "segmented marketing and a way to reach new and additional consumers." A staff editor for VH1 noted that as of June 16, 2011, 18,000 tickets were sold at discounted prices through Groupon for fifteen of the first twenty-four dates of the tour, including 1,800 at opening night in Sacramento. The Groupon deals for shows in Seattle, Winnipeg, Saint Paul, and Atlanta actually expired before all available discounted tickets were sold. The editor also stated that "the shows look to be under-attended in smaller cities, even as, in metropolitan areas like Greater New York City, new shows have been added. It remains to be seen whether this could have been remedied by better price optimization, or whether the tour’s ambition was more outsized than its actual draw." The Femme Fatale Tour was ranked at number fifty-five by Pollstar on the Top 100 North American Tours list, grossing $6.2 million in the first ten shows. On July 22, 2011, the shows in Atlanta and Nashville ranked Spears at number ten on "Billboard"'s Hot Tours list, with a combined gross of $1,563,934. On September 22, 2011, the tour was ranked at number six on the Top 20 Concert Tours list from Pollstar. It had an average gross of $940,165 per city, and an average ticket price of $84.19 during the shows in North America.
Groupon and Travelzoo offered discounted tickets for the shows in London, Manchester and Birmingham. Renee Freling from Travelzoo explained that "promoters are thinking, instead of shows being 90% sold out, they'd rather have it full and promote it to a wider audience." 238 tickets were sold through Groupon within minutes of the offer, and 5,000 tickets were sold for the UK shows by the time the offer expired. The move divided opinions in the music industry of the United Kingdom: festival organizer Melvin Benn said that discounted tickets work "particularly well for an awful lot of concerts. It's definitely emerging. In tough economic times people will look at varying ways of pricing their tickets." Independent promoter John Rostrum called it "very short-term" and "incredibly damaging for shows because in the future when a show goes on sale people will sit back and go, 'I won't buy until the week before'". The October 30, 2011 concert in Birmingham was her first in the English Midlands since The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004. A week before the show, the venue's box office told the "Leicester Mercury" that the concert was "probably about half-full. There's good availability". -->
In December 2011, the Femme Fatale Tour was number 19 on "Billboard"s Top 25 Tours of 2011. The magazine counted for 39 of the tour's dates (14 of which were sold out) with an overall gross of $37.1 million and 396,000 tickets sold. In the North America, the tour was the fourteenth highest-grossing tour 2011, with $38.3 million in ticket sales and 423,017 people attending at an average of 9,196 per show. Worldwide, the Femme Fatale Tour was the eleventh highest-grossing tour of 2011, with a gross of $68.7 million. 697,957 fans attended the shows worldwide, with an average attendance of 8,724, paying an average of $98.43.
Broadcast and recordings.
In July 2011, a high-quality recording of the Las Vegas show was uploaded to YouTube. On July 14, 2011, the vice president of Online Anti-Piracy from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), Marc McDevitt, requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from YouTube of the user who uploaded the video, including the IP address, e-mail address and any other relevant information to identify the person. Although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to YouTube, it is thought to be the first time the RIAA filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader. The case was closed after a week; according to a copyright lawyer, it is most likely that the subpoena was granted by the court and that YouTube agreed to hand over the personal details that were requested. The video was removed from YouTube, but copies of the full concert can still be found on the site.
On August 12, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account that the Toronto shows at the Air Canada Centre would be taped to air on the Epix television channel, and for release on DVD. Within minutes of her announcement, traffic to EPIX social sites doubled and Britney Spears became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. The show, initially titled "Britney Spears: Femme Fatale", was shot in 2D and 3D by 3ality Digital. On September 9, 2011, it was announced by the BBC that BBC Worldwide had attained distribution rights of the show outside the United States. The 2D version will be available for broadcast from Christmas Eve 2011, with the 3D version available in February 2012. The special premiered on November 12, 2011 at 20:00 EST (01:00 UTC). It received mixed reviews from critics: some praised the special and the impressive stage, while others criticized Spears' dancing. The DVD and Blu-ray were released in the United States on November 21, 2011. The DVD was released in the United Kingdom on November 28, 2011. During the concert in Lima, Peru, the song "I Wanna Go" was professionally filmed by Coca-Cola as part of the competition "Dance with Britney Spears."

Majczek and Marcinkiewicz

Joseph Majczek and Theodore Marcinkiewicz were two men arrested and convicted of the murder of Chicago Traffic Police Officer William D. Lundy in November 1933. Some 11 years later in 1944, following the intervention of Chicago Times reporter James McGuire, both men were exonerated of the crime.
The details of the case were used as the basis of the 1948 film "Call Northside 777" starring James Stewart, Lee J. Cobb and Richard Conte.
Background.
On October 10, 1944, a classified advertisement appeared in the Chicago Times: "$5,000 REWARD FOR KILLERS OF OFFICER LUNDY ON DEC. 9, 1932. CALL GRO 1758, 12-7 P.M." The ad was brought to the attention of the city editor Karin Walsh, who assigned seasoned police reporter James McGuire to dig into the story further. McGuire researched the case and learned that Officer Lundy had been murdered on December 9, 1932 and that Joseph Majczek, 24, and Theodore Marcinkiewicz, 25, were convicted in 1933 at the Cook County Superior Court.
The convictions (which the Illinois Supreme Court had affirmed as People v. Majczek, 360 Ill. 261 (1935)) were based largely on the testimony of eyewitness Vera Walush. She was recorded as the proprietor of a "delicatessen" (a euphemism for a speakeasy) where the crime occurred. Though both defendants presented strong alibis based on a number of witnesses saying they were elsewhere when the crime took place, both were convicted.
Upon calling the number from the ad, McGuire reached Majczek's mother Tillie. McGuire realized there was potential for a human interest story developing when he learned that the $5,000 on offer had been earned by the mother scrubbing floors at the Commonwealth Edison Company.
Criminal case.
McGuire first suspected there may have been a wrongful conviction when he learned that Majczek and Marcinkiewicz had not gone to the electric chair for the officer's murder but were sentenced to 99 years each at Joliet. This might indicate the trial judge may have had concerns about their convictions.
On October 11, McGuire read notes that Majczek had written in prison. In these Majczek stated that following his conviction, the trial judge, Charles P. Molthrop, told Majczek that he believed a miscarriage of justice had occurred and promised him a new trial. Additionally, Majczek stated that a certain James Zagata witnessed Molthrop's admission. Zagata was a witness to the murder and believed the wrong men had been convicted.
McGuire was uncertain of the veracity of a judge having a private conversation with a convicted murderer - especially one convicted of killing a policeman. But no retrial had taken place as Judge Molthrop had died in 1935. McGuire now went in search of Zagata and located him, still employed as a coal truckdriver and very cooperative. Zagata fully corroborated Majczek's account of the conversation in Molthrop's chambers.
Zagata had been presented with a police lineup including Majczek but had been unable to positively identify Majczek. He restated this at the later trial. Subsequently, Zagata told the Times, he thought neither of the convicted men fitted his recollection of the killers. He was certain that the true killers had been much taller than the short-statured Majczek. Zagata also said that Judge Molthrop had requestioned him a few days after the verdict - the judge was particularly interested in Zagata's issues with the identification. Zagata recalled the judge saying he was going to get a retrial for the two men.
Prohibition and politics.
In the following days, the Times disclosed that Vera Walush, whose testimony had been the sole evidence against Majczek and the principal evidence against Marcinkiewicz, had initially not recognised either man during the police lineup. The paper also reported that Walush had been running a speakeasy and that she had been threatened with arrest if she refused to testify against Majczek and Marcinkiewicz. They also reported that the reason Judge Molthrop had failed to grant the defendants new trials was that he had been warned by prosecutors that granting a new trial would end his career in politics.
Cop killings often led to strong pressure for a conviction, especially with the spiraling murder rate of Prohibition-era Chicago. The same week Officer Lundy had been killed, there were five other unsolved murders in Chicago.
Falsified records.
Further digging led McGuire to learn how Majczek and Marcinkiewicz had become suspects. Vera Walush had initially been unable to identify the killer but after hours of interrogation she said one them could have been a man she knew only as "Ted". Police believed this to be a local man, Theodore Marcinkiewicz, and he became a prime suspect, but could not be located. Two weeks after the crime, a bootlegger was arrested and in exchange for not being charged, he told police that Marcinkiewicz had been staying with the Majczek family. The police raided the Majczek home on December 22, 1932, and though Marcinkiewicz wasn't there, they took Joseph Majczek into custody.
Majczek asserted that Vera Walush had not identified him in two separate lineups on December 22, but by December 23 Walush was able to positively identify him. The police then wrote a false report stating that Majczek had been arrested on December 23, the day Walush had identified him. Walush later positively identified Marcinkiewicz when he surrendered on January 23, 1933.
Walker Butler.
McGuire located the original arrest report, corroborating Majczek's contention that he had been arrested on December 22. When the State's Attorney's Office refused to reopen the case based on McGuire new evidence, the Times hired well-known lawyer Walker Butler to seek a pardon for Majczek, ignoring the similarly situated Marcinkiewicz.
In addition to claims that Majczek appeared to have been framed, Butler also developed a substantial claim that Majczek's trial attorney, W.W. O'Brien, had performed incompetently. Key witnesses of dubious credibility provided damaging testimony against Marcinkiewicz. One of these, Bessie Barron, claimed Marcinkiewicz had told her he was going to rob Walush's speakeasy. The other, Bruno Uginchus, testified that after the murder Marcinkiewicz said "he had a little trouble." Whilst neither of these statements related to Majczek, O'Brien failed to object to their admission. O'Brien also failed to cross examine Vera Walush on her initial inability to identify him. These issues had not been raised on appeal because O'Brien handled it as well.
Exoneration.
On August 15, 1945, Majczek received a full pardon based on innocence from Illinois Governor Dwight H. Green. However, Marcinkiewicz remained locked up. He was legally exonerated through a state habeas corpus proceeding in 1950. Life magazine photographed Majczek, Marcinkiewicz and McGuire all leaving the jail house together.
Both men were later compensated by special appropriations — $24,000 for Majczek and $35,000 for Marcinkiewicz. 
Majczek died in 1983 aged 73.

Pleasant Valley, Baker County, Oregon

Pleasant Valley is an unincorporated community in Baker County, Oregon, United States. It is located about 13 miles southeast of Baker City on U.S. Route 30, slightly bypassed by Interstate 84.
Pleasant Valley was a way station on the Place Toll Road in 1865, and later a freight station on the railroad in 1884. Early Oregon Trail settlers farmed in the area. Pleasant Valley post office was established in 1868 and only operated for two months. An office with the same name was established in 1890 and closed in 1962. According to the authors of "Oregon Geographic Names", the community later consisted only of a motel and a Union Pacific Railroad station. By 2001, the motel had been converted into a residence.
The Pleasant Valley area is the home of several stone quarries that supplied the tuff stone commonly used for building material in Baker City. At one time Pleasant Valley was a community with enough population and settled arable land surrounding it to warrant a school district. School District #12 was organized by superintendent W. F. Payton in 1874, with a two-room school house serving grades 1 through 8. The district added classes for high-school-age students for a few years before consolidating with the Baker City school district in 1949. The third and last schoolhouse was constructed of the nearby native stone and was later converted to a residence. In 1900, the community had a Christian Church congregation. Today the community proper is considered a ghost town, however the USGS lists it as a populated place.

Dirar Abu Seesi

Dirar Abu Seesi or: Abu Sisi (Arabic: ضرار أبو سيسي; born in 1969 in Jordan) is the Deputy Engineer for the Gaza Strip's sole electrical plant, which provides 25% of Gaza's power, Israel alleges that he is a Hamas weapons engineer. In February 2011, he traveled to Ukraine, his wife's native country, to apply for citizenship, after coming to believe that Gaza was no longer a safe place to raise his six children. He disappeared in Poltava on February 19, and later turned up in an Israeli prison. It turned out he was kidnapped by Israeli intelligence personnel. On April 4, he was indicted for his alleged aid to Hamas.
Abduction.
On the evening of February 18, after formally filing the papers for citizenship, Abu Seesi was traveling by train to the Kiev airport for a reunion with his brother Yussef, who was residing in the Netherlands and whom he had not seen in 15 years. Just outside the city of Poltava, two men, who the family believes were Ukrainian security agents, entered the train and removed Dirar. After that, he disappeared. His wife Veronika, who was in Ukraine at the time as well, did not hear from him for a week. During that period of silence, she summoned the Ukrainian press and made allegations that the Mossad had kidnapped him. On February 27, the Palestinian Interior Ministry demanded that the Ukrainian Interior Ministry disclose the reasons for his disappearance.
Dalia Kerstein, executive director of the Israeli human rights NGO, HaMoked, confirmed that the Gazan engineer was in an Israeli prison. Kerstein identified Abu Seesi’s Israeli attorney Michal Orkabi, who confirmed that she represented him, but she could provide no further information due to a security gag order imposed by the Petah Tikva Magistrates' Court preventing her from speaking about the case. On March 20, the gag order was partially lifted with Israel admitting it was holding Abu Seesi.
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees became involved in the case when it determined that Abu Seesi was classified as a refugee. An Associated Press article revealed that the UNHCR's Ukrainian representative asked Ukraine to account for any role its own officials may have played in the disappearance.
Veronika Abu Seesi claims that Israel kidnapped him because he was the “brain of the power system” and that he had rebuilt it himself after it was destroyed during Operation Cast Lead in 2009. The "Wall Street Journal" and "Washington Post" both report that Abu Seesi had devised a technique, enabling the plant to rely solely on diesel fuel supplied by Egypt that could fully power the plant. This would enable it to bypass Israel as its sole source of fuel to run the plant. The German weekly "Der Spiegel" indicated that Abu Seesi's abduction was owing to information he had in relation to missing Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was being held by Palestinian militants in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a live interview with YouTube World View and Channel Two News, said that Abu Seesi is a Hamas man being held in Israel, and he disclosed valuable information. Israeli officials were insinuating earlier that Abu Seesi was involved in weaponry for Hamas.
Indictment.
On April 4, 2011, Abu Seesi was indicted in the Beersheba District Court, charged with "membership in a terrorist organization, conspiracy to commit a crime, and the production of illegal weaponry, assistance to an illegal organization and other various crimes". According to the indictment, Abu Seesi was the central developer of the Qassam rocket, among other rockets and anti-tank missiles, was responsible for upgrading older rockets for Hamas and served as the commander of Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Military Academy.

Suns of Arqa

Suns of Arqa are a World Music collective founded in 1979 by Michael Wadada. Since the group's formation, over 200 people from around the world have played and recorded with them, and in many cases these were like-minded musicians Wadada met as he travelled the world. Pioneers of World Beat, Ambient, Downtempo and Electro-Dub, Suns of Arqa draw inspiration from around the world, interpreting indigenous, tribal and classical folk traditions. They have created an impressive legacy and earned worldwide recognition.
Early days.
Suns of Arqa started out in the World Music scene in 1979, recording their debut album Revenge of the Mozabites which was produced by Adrian Sherwood, who later became known for On-U Sound Records. In 1982, they were invited to play at the first WOMAD Festival by Peter Gabriel. They performed with Prince Far-I at his last concert before his death in 1982. Since then, they have gone on to work with a variety of musicians and performers, such as John Cooper Clarke, Professor Stanley Unwin, flautist Tim Wheater, Adrian Sherwood, singer Helen Watson and a great many others.
The 1990s and beyond.
In the early 1990s, Wadada started his own Arka Sound label, and started re-issuing the group's older vinyl albums on new compilation CDs. One of these, 'Land of a Thousand Churches', was a compilation featuring collaborations with artists such as James Young, Helen Watson and Feso Trombone. His combination of Hindu and Celtic traditions at a musical level became a trademark that ultimately became identifiable as his musical style. A few years later, Suns of Arqa worked with artists such as 808 State, A Guy Called Gerald, John Leckie, Zion Train, Muslimgauze, Youth and Astralasia. The results were a fusion of dub, drum and bass, and the existing styles which Suns of Arqa were associated with.
Live.
Throughout their career Suns of Arqa have played at various major music festivals, including the Glastonbury Festival, Phoenix Festival and the first WOMAD Festival. By the mid 1990s, the Suns of Arqa live setup added Scottish bagpipes, Indian strings, reggae percussion, and a variety of other instruments and sounds. They have released three live albums to date, Musical Revue (later reissued as 'Live with Prince Far I'), 'Animan', and 'Big and Live'.
Media.
NME have described Suns of Arqa albums as "definitely the most unusual records of all time", and added that "Some might call it ‘genius’; most will just settle for the word ‘insane’. Either way, the result is fascinating", while East West Journal (USA) have said ”I’m not at all certain how this band manages to so cohesively merge rhythms no other group in the world has dared to mix, I only know that their music is reverent, humorous, profound, disorientating, terrifying and fantastic all at the same time.”. Rick Anderson of All Music Guide wrote that ”Many bands claim to deal in global fusion music, but few have as firm a claim on the genre as the Suns of Arqa ... Big & Live documents several recent live performances and shows Wadada and his cohorts in top form, delivering everything from Celtic-reggae fusion ‘Om Kaaraaya’ ... to Asian meditational sounds ... and sounds in between, such as ‘Majhi Ra’, which adds the keening tones of the shenai to the Celtic-reggae mix. There are fine vocal performances by Angel Eye, Reba Bhaduri and Cat Von Trapp ... some listeners will find this music immediately delightful, while other will probably be mostly puzzled.”

1990 United States Figure Skating Championships

The 1990 United States Figure Skating Championships was an event organized by U.S. Figure Skating to determine the U.S. national champions and the U.S. teams for the 1990 World Championships. Medals were awarded in four colors: gold (first), silver (second), bronze (third), and pewter (fourth) in four disciplines – men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and ice dancing – across three levels: senior, junior, and novice. The 1990 Championships took place in Salt Lake City, Utah.
One of the figure-skating pairs, Natasha Kuchiki and Todd Sand, finished in the top three, technically qualifying for the world championships in Halifax, Nova Scotia. They were unable to compete, however, because Kuchiki was only 12, and the rules required her to have turned 14 the July before the championships commence. Sand was 26 years old at the time.

Kanmailia

The Kanmailia are a Muslim community found in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. Their preferred self-designation is Shaikh.
Origin.
The Kanmailia are a Muslim occupational caste, that traditionally specialized in cleaning ear wax. They get their name from two Hindi words, "kan" meaning ears and "mailia" meaning dirt. During the period of British colonial rule, the Kanmailia were declared to be a criminal tribe under the Criminal Tribes Act. After independence, they were denotified in 1952, when the Criminal Tribes Act was replaced with the Habitual Offenders Act, but the community continues to carry considerable social stigma. Little is own about the origin of this community. Their own traditions speak of the community descending from early Arab settlers to India, and the community prefer the self designation Shaikh, a name traditionally associated with those groups who claim a Arab ancestry in India. They are found mainly in Lucknow, and the districts of Ghazipur and Etawah.
Present Circumstances.
The Kanmailia are strictly endogamous, and marry close kin. Each Kanmailia settlement contains an informal caste council, known as a "biradari panchayat", which acts as an instrument of social control. The Kanmailia are Sunni Muslims, but still incorporate many folk beliefs and traditions. Most Kanmailia are still engaged in cleaning ear wax. They are often found at bus stations and train stations practising their occupation. A small number are now employed as day labourers. They are extremely marganalized community, suffering from severe poverty.

HMS Comus (1806)

HMS "Comus" was a 22-gun "Laurel"-class sixth-rate post ship of the Royal Navy. She was launched in 1806. In 1807 she took part in one notable single-ship action and was at the capture of Copenhagen. In 1815 she spent six months with the West Africa Squadron suppressing the slave trade during which time she captured ten slavers and freed 500-1000 slaves. She was wrecked in 1816, though with no loss of life.
Canaries.
She was commissioned in October 1806 under her first captain, Conway Shipley. The following year her boats executed cutting-out operations in the Canaries. On 15 March 1807 her boats, under the command of Lieutenant George Edward Watts, entered "Puerto de Haz" , Grand Canaria, which was defended by the crossfire of three shore batteries. The British succeeded in bringing out six Spanish brigs (one armed with five guns), three with cargoes of salt pork, salt fish, or wine and fruit, and three in ballast. The only British casualty was a lieutenant, who was wounded. That month "Comus" also captured two brigs, the "St Philip", with salt fish, and "Nostra Senora de los Remedies", with a mixed cargo of merchandise.
On 8 May "Comus" sent her boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended by a strong fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed felucca, which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The boarding party, under the command of Lieutenant Watts, cleared her deck of her crew and the boats started to pull her out (the Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay pulled on a hawser. Eventually the boarding party cut the hawser and the boats succeeded in pulling the felucca out, an operation they conducted under fire. The felucca was the packet ship "San Pedro de Apostol", which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, "San Pedro de Apostol" had captured the "Lord Keith", which had been sailing from London to Mogador.
The British lost one man killed and five men wounded, one of whom was Watts, who had been severely wounded. The Spanish casualties included her captain and some crew killed, and 21 men taken prisoner, of whom 19 were wounded. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded Watts a sword worth £50. The prize money was substantial too.
In May, "Comus" captured the Spanish lugger "St Francisco", with her cargo of wheat and salt. The other capture was the schooner "Louisa", a completely new vessel sailing in ballast.
"Comus" vs. "Fredrickscoarn".
"Comus" was under Captain Edward Heywood from July 1807, and in August she was with the expedition to Copenhagen. During this service she took part in a notable, illegal and ultimately one-sided single-ship action, and accumulated substantial prize money.
On 12 August the 32-gun Danish frigate "Frederiksværn" ("Fredrickscoarn" in British usage), sailed for Norway from Elsinor and Admiral Lord Gambier sent the 74-gun third rate and "Comus" after her, even though war had not yet been declared. "Comus" was faster than "Defence" in the light winds and so outdistanced her.
On 14 August 1807 "Comus" sighted "Frederiksværn" and chased her, catching up off Marstrand a little before midnight on the 15th. Heywood ordered the "Frederiksværn" to halt and allow herself to be detained. War not having been declared, and "Frederiksværn" being a naval vessel, she ignored Heywood's instructions. Heywood ordered a musket fired, to which "Frederiksværn" replied with a shot from her stern guns. "Comus" followed with a broadside.
After an action of 45 minutes, "Frederiksværn"s rigging was disabled. "Comus" and "Frederiksværn" then came together, which enabled a boarding party from "Comus" to climb over "Frederiksværn"s bow and capture her.
The two vessels had been relatively evenly matched in firepower. "Comus"s broadside weighed 204 pounds, while "Frederiksværn"s broadside weighed 200 pounds. However, "Frederiksværn" had a crew of 226 men to "Comus"s 145 men. Still, the British had suffered only one man wounded. The Danes lost 12 men killed and 20 wounded, some mortally.
The Royal Navy took her into service as .
"Defence" and "Comus" then sailed in search of a Danish 74-gun reported to be returning to Copenhagen, but did not find her. On 18 August "Comus" captured the Danish merchant vessel "Haabet".
"Comus" went on to participate in the capitulation of Copenhagen on 7 September and to share in the prize money for that. "Comus" also shared with in the recapture on the same day of the "Britannia". Three days later "Comus" shared with and in the capture of the Danish merchant vessel "Fredeus Forsward". Later that month, on 9 September, "Comus" and "Pelican" captured the Danish merchant vessel "Elizabeth vonder Pahlen", but had to share with "Defence", which was in sight. Three days after that, on 2 October, "Comus" and "Pelican" captured the Danish merchant vessel "Anna Catherina".
Subsequent service.
Captain Josceline Percy took command in November 1807, and sailed to Portugal later that month. There "Comus" participated in the occupation of Madeira by Sir Samuel Hood. Here her primary task was to reconnoiter the island. She returned to Hood's fleet on 23 December and the British took unopposed possession the next day.
Captain Matthew Smith took command in 1808, and "Comus" continued off the Portuguese coast and in the Mediterranean. On 5 February she captured sundry Danish vessels at St. Ubes (Setubal, Portugal). The vessels "Comus" captured were the "Ovenum", "Martha Beata", "Aufgehende Sonne", "Finegheden", "Johannes", "Soe Blomstedt", "Speculation", "Haabet", "Fortuna", "Bragernes" and "Magdalena". The initial distribution of prize money amounted to ₤12,000. Given the small size of her crew, this resulted in a notable amount even for an ordinary seaman.
On 27 February 1808 she captured the American brig "Fame".
On 20 February 1811 "Comus" was part of a flotilla of English warships and Spanish transports under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Godwin Keats. The flotilla was waiting to land some British troops and 7,000 Spanish troops at Tariffa. The weather did not permit the landing so instead the British troops landed at Algeciras and marched to Tariffa, later being joined by the Spanish troops when the transports could sail.
On 10 May 1812, Smith, on behalf of the British government, signed a treaty of commerce with His Highness Sidi Jusef Caramanli, Bashaw, Bey, Governor and Captain General of the City and Kingdom of Tripoli in the West.
On 14 May 1813 "Comus" captured the American brig "Jane Barnes". In March 1814 she delivered £600,000 to Arthur Wellesley, Marquess Wellington.
She was under Captain John Tailour from November 1814, during which time she served off West Africa. On 17 March 1815 "Comus" captured the Portuguese slave schooner "Dos Amigos".
Then on 15 July she captured the Spanish slaver "Palafox".
"Comus" also captured the Spanish slavers "Nuestra Senora del Carmen" (120 slaves), the "Intrepida" (245 slaves), and the "Catalina" (no slaves). Among the slaves there were 54 boys and 47 girls. All three vessels were condemned at the court in Sierra Leone.
"Comus" appears to have been the first warship to have sailed up the Calabar River as far as Duke's Town. There her boats captured seven Portuguese and Spanish slavers carrying some 550 slaves. First though, they had to overcome the slavers' determined resistance, which resulted in some bloodshed.
Captain Thomas Tucker had succeeded Tailour by 1816, and Captain James Gordon Bremer succeeded Tucker.
Fate.
"Comus" was wrecked at St Mary's Bay, off Cape Pine, Newfoundland on 24 October 1816. At around midnight she grounded and developed leaks. The crew abandoned her around 3am when she threatened to roll over on her side as the tide receded. Subsequent efforts to refloat her were unsuccessful. The wreck was abandoned on 4 November 1816. The subsequent court martial blamed the wrecking on a strong current that had driven her closer to shore than Bremer had realized. However, the court also warned Bremer and the master, Bateman Ainsworth, to be more careful in the future, finding that they had been overconfident in their navigation and had failed to take frequent depth soundings. The court added that Bremer, his officers and his crew were
due the greatest praise "for their arduous exertions in their endeavours to save her, and also for their good and steady conduct throughout the business, both in the boats and on shore."

Pleasant Valley is an unincorporated community in Tillamook County, Oregon, United States. It is located about seven miles south of Tillamook, on U.S. Route 101.
The community was probably named for the pleasant surroundings. However a local resident who wrote to the compiler of "Oregon Geographic Names" commented that the place "should have been called Wrangletown because of the disputes and feuds among the residents."

Ham Avery

Charles Hammond "Ham" Avery (April 8, 1854 - January 3, 1927) was an American lawyer, in his youth a college baseball pitcher and a professional baseball umpire.
Avery, son of Charles L'Hommedieu Avery and Martha (Bakewell) Avery, was a prep school student in Cincinnati in 1870; the next year he enrolled at Yale, where he joined the baseball team in the spring of his sophomore year in 1873. He was called (by Frank Blair) "the first man to pitch a curve-ball game," using the new pitch with success against Harvard. When he graduated in 1875, he was offered the very large salary of $3,400 by Harry Wright to pitch for the Boston Red Stockings, an offer matched by the Hartford Dark Blues, but "Avery, a Skull & Bones Society blueblood, thought professional baseball beneath him, and demurred." He went on to study at the Cincinnati Law School and in the office of Judge Alphonso Taft and was admitted to the Cincinnati bar in 1878, where he had a successful legal practice, representing "various well-known corporations." He married Nettie Barker in 1882; she died the following year, and in 1890 he married Alice Aiken, with whom he had a daughter and a son.
Avery umpired 9 total National Association games in and . all of them as the home plate umpire.

Nuclear energy in Ghana

There are currently no nuclear power plants in Ghana, although there are several nuclear research reactors in Ghana as well as plans to build a power plant.
The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission has been investigating the use of nuclear power and is a member of the International Nuclear Library Network. The commission is working with the International Atomic Energy Agency to implement nuclear power in Ghana as part of a wider project, Sustainable Energy Development for Sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana also has a National Nuclear Research Institute which trains undergraduate and postgraduate students in the techniques of nuclear science application in such areas as agriculture, medicine, and research. Both of these organizations focus more on research and the two research reactors located in Ghana than on nuclear power.
The government of Ghana plans to commission the building of a nuclear power plant by 2018. President John Agyekum Kufuor supported the future building of nuclear power plants, seeing it as part of a solution to the country's energy problems. He initiated a Nuclear Power Committee to study the issue. In 2011, the director of the National Nuclear Research Institute, Benjamin Nyarko, also said he believed nuclear power could prevent future energy crises. The ministry has created a section to co-ordinate activities on the nuclear power project.

<doc id="31165659" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31165659" title="McCook Daily Gazette">
McCook Daily Gazette

The McCook Daily Gazette is a newspaper published in the city of McCook, in the southwestern part of the state of Nebraska, in the Great Plains region of the United States. It serves southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas. The newspaper is issued five days a week, Monday through Friday afternoons. As of 2011, it had a circulation of 4,564.
The paper was founded in 1911 by Harry D. Strunk and Burris H. Stewart as the "Red Willow Gazette". Thirteen years later, under Strunk's editorship, it became a daily and changed its name to the "McCook Daily Gazette". In 1929, the newspaper became one of the first in the world to be delivered regularly by air: for several months its airplane, the "Newsboy", flew a daily route, dropping bundles of newspapers to carriers in outlying towns. An image of the "Newsboy" still decorates the paper's nameplate.
Strunk published the "Gazette" until his death in 1960, when he was succeeded by his son Allen Strunk. In 1986, the paper was acquired by Gozia-Driver Media, which was later re-incorporated as US Media Group. In 1997, the "Gazette" was sold to Rust Communications.
History.
The paper's founder, Harry D. Strunk, was born in 1892 in Pawnee City, Nebraska. In 1906, at the age of 14, he was forced by family circumstances to quit school and go to work as a printer's devil (an apprentice) for the "Pawnee City Republican". A year later, he moved to Fairbury, Nebraska, but at the age of 16, when the editor of the "Republican" fell ill, he returned to Pawnee City and published the newspaper for three months until the editor's recovery. Strunk continued to move from newspaper to newspaper; in 1909, at the age of 17, he was shop foreman of the Norton, Kansas "Daily Telegram", overseeing ten typesetters.
Later in 1909, Strunk set off for the West Coast. En route, he saw and responded to an advertisement seeking a printer for the weekly "McCook Tribune". Nine months later, he and fellow "Tribune" employee Burris H. Stewart started their own job-printing shop, "with so few assets that they were forced to borrow money to buy ink". Six months later, in 1911, the two launched their own newspaper: the semi-weekly "Red Willow Gazette", again with no assets and with heavy debts. Distressed by their financial situation, Stewart committed suicide on the day of the paper's second issue.
Strunk persevered, and the paper proved successful. In 1914, it acquired a Linotype, the first between Hastings, Nebraska and Denver, Colorado; McCook became the smallest city in Nebraska to possess one. In 1924, the paper changed its name to the present "McCook Daily Gazette" and began daily publication; again, McCook became the smallest city in Nebraska with a daily newspaper. In 1926, the operation moved to a new building on Main Street, its facade inscribed with the paper's motto: "Service is the rent we pay for the space we occupy in this world."
The "Newsboy".
In the 1920s, the spread of the automobile and the improvement of roads in the United States made it easier for rural residents to do their shopping in larger towns farther from their homes. This gave merchants an incentive to advertise in newspapers that reached such residents. However, delivering the papers in a timely fashion became a problem for the publishers. The U.S. Mail was expensive, since postage rates for newspapers had been raised drastically by the War Revenue Act of 1917; it also took several days for the papers to reach some customers. In more developed parts of the country, publishers delivered papers by truck to local carriers in outlying towns. However, the improvement of roads in the McCook area was slower than in more densely populated areas. By 1929, U.S. Highway 38 (now U.S. Highway 6) had not yet been fully gravelled in southwestern Nebraska, and most roads off the main highways were impassable in bad weather.
Strunk's solution was to go by air. In 1929, he paid $8,000 for a Curtiss Robin C1 two-seater monoplane, christened the "Newsboy". On September 13, 1929, air delivery began. The "Newsboy" flew a nonstop three-hour route covering , passing over more than 40 communities in southwestern Nebraska and northwestern Kansas. At each town, a bundle of papers was dropped from a height of onto a prearranged field, where it was picked up by local carriers. Papers were delivered as far west as Benkelman, Nebraska, from McCook; east to Orleans, Nebraska, away; and south to Atwood, Kansas, distant.
Beside delivering papers to far-flung communities, the "Newsboy" served to promote the "Gazette". Interest in aviation was still strong after Charles Lindbergh's celebrated 1927 solo flight from New York to Paris. The newspaper offered a ride in the airplane to every two-year subscriber. It also opened a flying school: the pilot of the "Newsboy" would give flying lessons in the morning, then deliver the day's papers in the afternoon. To emphasize the newspaper's connection with aviation, a new nameplate was introduced, with wings behind the name and airplanes on either side. Whether or not because of the airplane, the circulation of the "Gazette" increased from 2800 in 1928 to 4500 in 1930.
Delivery by air lasted for less than a year. In May 1930, the "Newsboy" was damaged by high winds while parked at the McCook airport. Strunk opted not to repair it and return it to service, citing "week after week of inclement weather, during which time we have found it impossible to fly our route on schedule". The airplane was not yet built, he wrote, that could "fly successfully in rain, wind, sleet, snow and fog."
A few major metropolitan newspapers had made short-term experiments with air delivery in 1928 and 1929. However, the months-long effort by the "Gazette" made it the first newspaper to conduct regular deliveries by air.
After the "Newsboy" was taken out of service, it was sold and restored several times. In 1972, it was placed on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle.
1930-1960.
The end of the aviation experiment forced the "Gazette" to return to ground-based delivery. Newspapers for outlying communities were transported there on commercial buses running through McCook; local carriers picked them up at their towns' bus stops. Same-day delivery was no longer possible for subscribers in communities off the main highways; they had to settle for next-day delivery.
In 1934, the "Gazette" absorbed the "South Side Sentinel" of Marion, Nebraska. In 1936, it acquired the triweekly "McCook Tribune", at which Strunk had worked on his arrival in McCook. Later, in 1957, it absorbed the "Red Willow County Reporter".
On the eve of World War II, the "Gazette" acquired one of the last teletypesetters manufactured. With this machine, the paper could be produced with only two printers; this allowed it to remain in production at a time when Linotype operators were in short supply because of the war.
The "Gazette" made a second attempt at air delivery in 1950. For four years, a Cessna 120 was used to deliver papers to outlying communities. The high cost of operating the airplane, and the increasing availability of good roads for ground delivery, ended the venture. The plane was replaced by a fleet of small trucks and automobiles, all of which continued to bear the name "Newsboy".
After the Republican River flood of 1935, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a study of the river's watershed. Released in 1940, it concluded that there were no good dam sites upstream from Republican City, Nebraska, where the Harlan County Dam is now located. Since 112 deaths and the bulk of the property damage caused by the flood had occurred in the upper Republican valley, which includes McCook, the report led to dissatisfaction among residents of the area. Strunk and three others formed the Republican Valley Conservation Association, which lobbied aggressively for the development of a flood-control program for the entire basin; the "Gazette" provided office space to the organization. The RVCA's efforts led to the construction of a number of dams in the area: one on the Republican at Trenton, Nebraska, and several on tributaries of the river in Nebraska and Kansas. One of the latter was built on Medicine Creek in Frontier County, Nebraska; the reservoir behind it has been named Harry Strunk Lake.
After 1960.
Harry Strunk published the "Gazette" until his death in 1960, after which his son Allen Strunk succeeded him. Under Allen Strunk, the newspaper made the conversion from letterpress to offset printing.
At the end of 1986, the Strunk family sold the newspaper to Gozia-Driver Media, which was later re-incorporated as US Media Group. Allen Strunk was succeeded as publisher by Dick Gozia and John Burgess, who occupied the position from 1987 to 1990, followed by Gene Morris, who became publisher in 1990.
In 1997, the "Gazette" was acquired by Rust Communications. In 2002, it launched a weekly shopper, the "Big Nickel", inserted in the Friday newspaper and distributed free from racks throughout the newspaper's circulation area.
Upon Gene Morris's retirement in 2007, general manager Shary Skiles was named publisher. In 2009, the newspaper ended Saturday publication, moving to a schedule of five issues a week, released on Monday through Friday afternoons.
The circulation of the "Gazette" has declined in the 21st century. In 2001, the Nebraska Press Association listed it as 6,709. In 2005, a report by the Knight Foundation gave it as "approximately 5,903". In 2011, the Nebraska Press Association's website listed the number as 4,564.

Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata

The Anglo-French blockade of the Río de la Plata was a five-year long naval blockade imposed by France and Britain on the Argentine Confederation ruled by Juan Manuel de Rosas. It was imposed in 1845 to support the Colorado Party in the Uruguayan Civil War and closed Buenos Aires to naval commerce. The Anglo-French navy trespassed into the internal waters of Argentina, in order to sell their products, as Rosas maintained a protectionist policy to improve the weak Argentine economy. Eventually both Britain and France gave in, signing treaties in 1849 (Britain) and 1850 (France) acknowledging the Argentine sovereignty over its rivers.
Antecedents.
Local context.
Buenos Aires faced the French blockade of the Río de la Plata between 1838 and 1840. The Peru–Bolivian Confederation, allied with France, declared the War of the Confederation to Argentina and Chile. Rosas resisted the blockade longer than France estimated he would do, and his strategy of generating disputes between France and England over the blockade eventually gave fruit. France lifted the blockade in 1840, exchanging mutual most favoured nation status between her and the Argentine Confederation.
Unable to deploy French troops during the blockade, France promoted civil wars against Rosas to support the naval actions. For this purpose France aided Fructuoso Rivera against the Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe, who was forced to resign. Oribe escaped to Buenos Aires, and Rosas received him as the legitimate president of Uruguay, denying such recognition to Rivera. This started the Uruguayan Civil War, where the Blancos sought to restore Oribe in power and the Colorados to keep Rivera. As Rivera was hesitant to attack Rosas as the French expected, the Argentine expatriate Juan Lavalle was convinced to do so, but his army was weakened by desertions, hostility of the villages in the way to Buenos Aires, and the lack of French support, as France had negotiated peace with Rosas by that time. Lavalle's army retreated to the north in disorder, without attacking Buenos Aires as intended.
Rivera's ambition was to expand the limits of Uruguay, annexing Paraguay, the Argentine Mesopotamia and the Riograndense Republic (part of Rio Grande do Sul, that had declared independence from Brazil and was fighting the Ragamuffin War), into a projected Federation of Uruguay. The Argentine José María Paz, allied with Rivera against Rosas, was against this project. Rivera took control of Paz's forces, but without his superior military training, he was completely defeated by Oribe at the battle of Arroyo Grande. Rivera's project never got off the ground, and he was forced to stand in Montevideo against Oribe's siege.
Brazil proposed a military alliance to Rosas: Rosas would take Uruguay with Brazilian support, and Brazil would take the Riograndese Republic with Argentine support. Tomás Guido, Argentine representative in Brazil, supported the proposal, but Rosas rejected it. Rosas thought that such treaty would violate the Uruguayan sovereignty, and that it would be null if Oribe was not part of it. Honório Carneiro Leão, representative of Brazil, did not accept Rosas's alternative proposal, and Brazil distanced from Argentina.
International context.
Britain did not have great interests at stake in Buenos Aires. The purpose of the war was to foster the Entente cordiale with France, so as to make possible later joint military operations elsewhere, such as the Opium War or the protection of the independence of the Republic of Texas. The British interests in South America grew when Texas was finally annexed by the United States. Texas supplied Britain with cotton, and the British calculated that it would be easier to secure cotton sources in South America (such as Paraguay) rather than waging war with the powerful United States. Britain republished many Uruguayan libels against Rosas, such as the Blood tables, so that people supported military action against him. As there was a strong British religious tradition, Rosas was accused of replacing the crosses of churches with his portrait, persecuting religion, and killing priests; and that he may have murdered his wife Encarnación Ezcurra and had incestuous relations with his daughter.
Two influential French politicians of the time were the foreign minister François Guizot and the nationalist Adolphe Thiers. Thiers proposed that France should continue the hostilities against Rosas. He explained his opinion with three main reasons and an accessory one: humanity, patriotism, international law and expansion of commerce. He viewed Rosas as a ruthless dictator, to justify the humanitarian reason. Although Montevideo was not a French colony, he referred to it as such due to its high population of French Basques. He considered that Rosas would be in contravention of the 4th article of the Mackau-Arana treaty (in which the Confederation recognized the independence of Uruguay) by attempting to impose an Argentine president on it. The expansion of commerce was not mentioned as a main reason, as Rosist protectionist policy limited but did not forbid French imports. Guizot rejected these ideas. He did not consider that Rosas contravened the Mackau-Arana treaty because the Confederation was not actually at war with Uruguay, but was merely supporting one Uruguayan faction against the other. He did not think that the French economy could be further benefited by taking action in La Plata, nor that it was workable to keep a colony in the zone. In respect to humanitarian reasons, he dismissed the purported Rosist crimes because they were based on reports by the Unitarian Florencio Varela, who had no reputation as an impartial reporter. However, Guitoz ultimately agreed to the proposal, in order to foster an alliance with Britain and reduce the popular acclaim of Thiers.
Brazilian viscount Miguel Calmon du Pin e Almeida meet the British Lord Aberdeen, to request that Brazil join Britain and France in the action against Rosas. But Britain did not have good relations with Brazil at that time, so Aberdeen rejected the Brazilian aid. Aberdeen complained that, if Brazil thought that civilization was tied with free trade, Brazil should accept extending their free trade agreement with Britain before imposing it on Rosas, and that if Brazil was concerned with humanitarian reasons they should start by abolishing slavery in their own country. Then he met Guizot, who was not receptive either. Guizot felt forced by circumstances to join a war where he did not expect to earn anything, and was reluctant to involve French troops in it. Britain would not resort to ground troops either, as the British invasions of the Río de la Plata had proved them ineffective. The viscount informed the Brazilian court of the Anglo-French resolution. The public purposes of the war were to protect the Uruguayan independence against Oribe, defend the recently proclaimed independence of Paraguay, and ended the civil wars at La Plata. He also revealed the secret purposes: To turn Montevideo into a "commercial factory", to force the free navigation of the rivers, to turn the Argentine Mesopotamia into a new country, to set the borders of Uruguay, Paraguay and the Mesopotamia (without Brazilian intervention), and to help the antirosistas to depose the governor of Buenos Aires and to establish one loyal to the European powers. For the viscount, it was an all-losing situation for Brazil: if the intervention was defeated, they would be helpless against the counter-attack of Rosas, Oribe and perhaps the Ragamuffins; and if the intervention prevailed, Brazil would have neighbors even more powerful than the Confederation. Thus, he strongly advised against joining it, and restoring good relations with Rosas if possible.
William Brent, representative of the United States in Buenos Aires and supporter of the Monroe Doctrine, supported Rosas in the dispute with the European powers, and proposed to act as mediator. After the victory at the battle of India Muerta, Oribe was about to enter to Montevideo. Brent proposed that he did so giving an amnesty to the supporters of Rivera, calling to elections in the Legislature, and then the Argentine forces supporting him should leave the country at that point. Oribe accepted, but the British arrived to Montevideo and refused to allow Oribe to enter to the city. Arana, Deffaudis and Ouseley rejected Brent's mediation, and gave an ultimatum: if the army of Oribe and the Argentine navy of William Brown did not leave Uruguay in ten days, they would proceed to block Buenos Aires.
Beginning of armed actions.
The same night the ultimatum was issued, still during the ten days period, the British ship "Cadmus" and the French one "D'Assas" anchored next to the Argentine ships "San Martín" and "25 de mayo". William Brown requested permission to return to Buenos Aires, which was allowed but with the condition of delivering the British and French sailors. Brown requested permission to do so in Buenos Aires, as most of his crew was Irish, but received no answer. When he finally sailed back to Buenos Aires, he was attacked. The Anglo-French forced boarded and seized the complete Argentine navy, the ships "San Martín", "25 de mayo", "General Echagüe", "Maipú" and "9 de julio". The French raised their flag in the first two, and the British did so in the last three. The Argentine officers were returned to Buenos Aires, and William Brown and all the British sailors were forbidden to sail under the Argentine flag during the remainder of the conflict.
The following day, the Anglo-French forces disembarked in Montevideo, reinforcing the defenses of the city. Since the defeat at India Muerta, the Montevidean defenders were less than 3 500. Rivera thanked these actions, saying that it secured the Uruguayan independence. Many politicians of Buenos Aires criticized them during a meeting in the Junta of Representatives in Buenos Aires.
Rosas learned in 1838 that the Isla Martín García was difficult to defend, so he removed the forces from it. However, to prevent foreign claims of sovereignty, he left a force of twelve aged crippled soldiers, who would keep the flag of Argentina raised until the end. The only purpose of this army was to assert that the island was not left abandoned, and that the Anglo-French forces would only take it by an invasion. General Lucio Mansilla received the forces and infrastructure of Martín García, to select a point in the Paraná River and fortify it. The west side of the river was preferred, to have easier communications with Buenos Aires. However, the support to the Uruguayan Oribe took priority, and no Argentine forces supporting the siege would be retired from it, not even temporarily. Mansilla prepared the defenses at Obligado, Buenos Aires, near San Pedro.
Declaration of blockade.
The blockade was formally declared on September 18, 1845. They cited many reasons. They said that Rosas did not stop the war despite their good intentions, or that the capture of the Argentine navy, invasion of Martín García and reinforcement of Montevideo were described in violent language at Buenos Aires newspapers, which was also found at the meeting of the Junta or in the messages that called the Unitarians "savages". A decree of August 27 had forbidden all Argentines to communicate with the Anglo-French navy. They also said that the foreigners in Buenos Aires were abused and drafted into the army, that Oribe made a butchery after the victory at India Muerta, and that the police was headed by the Mazorca, which would made several abuses. The tone was closer to that of a declaration of war, and may have been written by Florencio Varela.
To counter those claims, Rosas arranged a meeting with diplomats from the United States, Portugal, Sardinia, Bolivia and France. The British diplomat refused to assist, but the French Mareuil did so. All of them declared unanimously that they had no complains about the treatment to foreigners, that they had no knowledge of foreigners forced by terror into the military or to sign petitions, that they had no knowledge of abuses from the Mazorca, and that the information of alleged butcheries in India Muerta was inexact. Rosas included as well a petition signed by 15 000 British and French living in Buenos Aires, protesting against the blockade. Rosas was confident in that this formal declaration, signed by foreign diplomats, would counter the Montevidean propaganda and turn the international opinion to his side.
Durán de Mareuil, representative of French business in Buenos Aires, was among the signatories. He wrote a document requesting the end of the blockade, which included Rosas's demands. Those demands were the inclusion of Oribe in the negotiations, disarm of Montevideo, return of Colonia, Martín García and the stolen navy, departure from the internal rivers, acknowledgement of the sovereignty of Argentina and an indemnization. As expected, it was rejected in Montevideo, so Mareuil moved to Paris to give it directly to the French government.
Uruguay river.
The Anglo-French navy navigated the internal Uruguay river by mid August, led by Lainé and Inglefield. They announced that they would block any ports supporting Oribe, and remove the people in them with gunshots. In response, the ports were closed to any communication with the Anglo-French navy. Lainé and Inglefield moved to Colonia del Sacramento, with Giuseppe Garibaldi and his legion of Italian volunteers. They had a total of 28 ships, whereas Jaime Montoro, colonel defending the city had only 300 soldiers and eight small cannons. The Italian legion disembarked in the city and pillaged it. José Luis Bustamante blamed Garibaldi for it, while Garibaldi would attribute it to a lack of military discipline among his Legion. He would write in his memoirs that ""the repression of disorder was difficult, considering that Colonia had plenty of resources, and specially of spirituous liquids that increased the desires of the virtuous pillagers"". Even the local church was sacked, and the drunk Italians spent the night in it.
The navy moved then to Martín García, defeating the army stationed there. The flag of Argentina was removed, and replaced with the flag of Uruguay. the Argentine soldiers were removed, and the island was left abandoned.
The ship moved then into the Uruguay river. The pillage of Gualeguaychú was even worse than in Colonia, to the point that Bustamante wrote to Rivera worried about Garibaldi, fearing that his actions would discredit the whole operation. Garibaldi described that ""The city of Gualeguaychú drove us to conquest by being a real emporium of wealth, capable to dress our ragged soldiers and supply us with harnesses. We acquired many and very good horses in Gualeguaychú, the clothes needed to dress all the people, the harnesses of cavalry and some money distributed among our poor soldiers and sailors, who suffered so much time of misery and privations"". Garibaldi's plundering was valued in nearly 30,000 pound sterlings.
Garibaldi was defeated at Paysandú by colonel Antonio Díaz, and then at Concordia, defended by Juan Antonio Lavalleja and an improvised navy. Then, he took control and pillaged Salto. By November, the Anglo-French navy had control of all the Uruguay river from Colonia to Salto.
Parana river.
Once Montevideo had enough defenses, Ouseley and Defauis prepared a convoy to navigate the Parana river. This way they would reach Corrientes and Paraguay and, once having complete control of Uruguay and both rivers, force the Mesopotamia out of the Confederation. The convoy was composed of three steamboats, capable to navigate independently from the winds and a number of heavily armed sailboats. Those ships would protect 90 merchant vessels, of diverse nationalities. Arana notified the foreign diplomats that the ships entering the Paraná unauthorized would be reputed as pirates, so they informed their respective ships that they would not have protection from their home countries if they got involved in the operation. However, such messages were delayed, and the 90 ships took part of the operation anyway.
The Anglo-French weaponry was the most advanced of the time. They used "Peysar" rifled cannons, and the French brought the new Paixhans guns. The allies also bombarded the Confederation batteries with Congreve rockets. This would be the first time such weapons would be used in South America, and they expected their firepower to be devastating.
The convoy stopped at the Paraná Guazú channel to study the situation. Initially, the admirals though that they would navigate unopposed, but found that Lucio Mansilla had prepared many fortifications along the river. As a result, the merchant ships would stay behind, while the combat steams open the way. There were fortifications at Ramada, Tonelero, Acevedo, and San Lorenzo. The most important fortification was located in Obligado, near San Pedro.
Battle of Vuelta de Obligado.
In Obligado the Parana is only 700 m. wide, and the turning made sailboat navigation difficult. Mansilla placed 24 boats in succession, holding three thick chains to close the river. The west coast was the only one fortified, with four batteries. The biggest Argentine cannons were of caliber 20, whereas the average in the Anglo-French navy was of 80. The land was defended by the Regiment of Patricians, and the volunteers from the countryside were led by Facundo Quiroga (son of the famed caudillo of the same name). Many artilleries were operated by British sailors from the captured Argentine fleet, who disobeyed the orders of not fighting against their home country. A brig of six cannons was the only Argentine combat vessel.
The first steam boats arrived to Obligado on November 18, stopping beyond the range of the cannons. They waited for the stolen "San Martín" ship, captained by Trehouart, who arrived the following day. The attack was delayed one more day, because the rain did not allow a clear sight of the fortifications. The ships advanced on November 20. Lucio Mansilla arranged the troops saying: "There they are! Consider the insult they make to the sovereignty of our nation by navigating, with no more title than force, the waters of a river that flows across the territory of our country. But they won't achieve that unpunished! Let the blue and white banner wave in the Parana, and let's all of us die before seeing it come down from where it waves!"
The first ship to advance was the "San Martín". She was about to break the chains when the wind suddenly ended and she got stuck in the place, too far from the other ships, which could not got near because of the lack of wind. The "San Martín" was hit more than a hundred times, two cannons were destroyed, and two officers and forty sailors died. Finally, the chain of "San Martín"’s anchor was broken, and she moved down the river. The "Dolphin" and "Pandour" had to retreat as well.
When the "Republicano" ran out of ammunition, the captain blew it to prevent it from being captured. At this point, the steamboats (unaffected by the lack of wind) proceeded to the chains. Their powerful guns outranged the Argentine cannons. The "Fulton" got to the chains and broke them, and the wind blew again. The ships moved, and the defenses gradually ran out of ammunition as well. By the end of the day, all batteries were destroyed, and the cannons were destroyed or taken as trophies. 250 Argentine soldiers died, and 400 were injured. The Anglo-French fleet stayed 40 days in Obligado, making repairs.
Consequences of Obligado.
Word of the actions in Obligado spread around the continent. Most of the press, that so far had repeated the Montevidean libels, turned instead to support Rosas. Brazilian newspapers such as "O Brado de Amazonas" and "O Sentinella da Monarchia" referred to Rosas as a great South American hero. Francisco Antonio Pinto, former president of Chile, declared that the Chilean people was ashamed of the presence in Chile of a pair of newspapers that supported the Anglo-French cause. The president of Bolivia José Ballivián, who was so far against Rosas, instructed his diplomat Manuel Rodríguez to congratulate Rosas for the action of Obligado and protest "with reason of the disloyal and unjust Anglo-French intervention in the Río de la Plata against the rights and interests of the Americas". José de San Martín wrote a supporting letter to Rosas and, despite his old age, offered his military assistance. He also wrote a letter to the British "Morning Chronicle", explaining that a military occupation of Buenos Aires by Anglo-French forces would be nearly impossible.
The convoy resumed their navigation after the repairs, but with only 52 of the original 90 commercial ships, as the others returned to Montevideo. Mansilla made new attacks at the batteries in Tonelero and Acevedo, but the ships were not damaged very much. By moving to the east side of the river, they could fire against the batteries and destroy them from a safe distance. Mansilla made a more effective resistance at San Lorenzo, in the same site where José de San Martín fought the battle of San Lorenzo. The batteries here were hidden, and attacked the Anglo-French navy by surprise. Many merchant ships collided with others, and the steam ships fired for more than four hours. According to the British report, all ships received shots during the engagement.
The "Fulton" arrived to Asunción, with the intention to recognize the independence of Paraguay, recruit them against Rosas, and sign a treaty of commerce and friendship. Carlos Antonio López did not agree to the British terms, he expected recognition first, war later, and a treaty for the end; not all things at once. The commerce failed, as Corrientes and Paraguay were not as wealthy as the Anglo-French expected, and they returned with most of their products.
The return seemed difficult, as many ships were damaged and Mansilla was rearming the north of San Lorenzo, so they requested Montevideo to send reinforcements. The "Philomel" advanced at full speed, not answering fire whenever possible, reaching Montevideo in few days. The British steamboats "Lizard" and "Harpy" moved to reunite with the convoy. Those ships, however, stopped at Quebracho and returned fire, and the "Lizard" was badly damaged as a result.
Mansilla prepared a strong defense in Quebracho, against the returning convoy. He did not prepare chains to close the river this time, as the ships would be moving downstream, rather than upstream. This new attack was very successful. The Argentine cannons attacked the enemy ships at will, and the merchant ships attempted in vain to pass behind the warships. Two merchant ships were sunk, and others had to throw their cargo in the river to reduce their weight. The steam boats were the focus of the attack, the "Harpy" was disabled and the "Gorgon" suffered great damages. After three hours of fire, the ships escaped as they could, and four damaged merchant ships were set on fire to avoid Argentine capture.
End of the conflict.
After the failure of the expedition to the Parana, Ouseley wrote to his government requesting 10,000 British soldiers, 10,000 French soldiers and an open declaration of war to conclude the conflict. However, unknown to him, Tomás Samuel Hood was already navigating to Buenos Aires with the opposite instructions from the allied countries: negotiate an end to the hostilities, at whatever price Rosas demanded. The repercussion of the battle of Vuelta de Obligado modified the international perception of the conflict in La Plata. Hood had also promoted an end to the conflicts because Rosas had suspended the payment of the Argentine foreign debt to Britain as long as Britain maintained the blockade, and a long conflict would harm the finances of the Baring Brothers bank. Besides, there was an ongoing political scandal in Britain, as "The Times" had published Ouseley was favoring a personal business with the blockade.
Hood arranged with Rosas the conditions for peace, but Ouseley and Deffaudis refused to obey it. Deffaudis argued that he had no instructions from Paris to seek a peaceful resolution, and Ouseley that he had to work together with Deffaudis. Hood returned to Britain with the proposal negotiated with Rosas. The British administration was inclined to leave the conflict, but it was reluctant to accept the Hood bases, as they would mean a capitulation. Britain and France sent two new diplomats, John Hobart Caradoc and Alexandre Florian Joseph Colonna, who would pretend to agree with the Hood bases but surreptitiously change the terms. Rosas realized the trick, and did not accept their new proposal. They moved then to Uruguay, and negotiated an armistice with Oribe. Oribe accepted the British terms, but Rivera did not. This broke the alliance: the British diplomat was convinced that the terms were reasonable, and decided to go on with his original mission of ending the conflict. The French one declared instead that they would keep the blockade, even if it meant doing so alone.
Rosas received new diplomats, Henry Southern and Lepredour, but refused to have an interview with them before being aware of their intentions. Rosas wanted them to agree to the Hood bases, and would not accept anything else. The Arana-Southern Treaty with Britain was finally signed on March 3, 1849, in strict conformity with the terms negotiated with Hood. Britain would return the stolen ships, the Martín García island, remove their troops from Uruguay, accept the Argentine sovereignty over its internal waters, and condition the whole treaty to the approval of Oribe. Finally, the British navy would make a 21-gun salute to the flag of Argentina.
Negotiations with France took a longer time. There was a strong nationalism in France by that time, and a second defeat with Argentina would hurt the national pride. The parliament was divided in two proposals: to send Lepredour with a very powerful navy, to make a treaty favourable to the French terms by intimidating Rosas, or to openly declare war. The first proposal was accepted by 338 votes over 300. Rosas refused to negotiate unless the threatening navy was removed from Uruguay, and refused to acknowledge Lepredour as a diplomat. Lepredour made up an excuse for the navy, and negotiated for nearly five months. Rosas finally agreed on August 31, 1850, to a pair of small concessions that did not actually modify the important points of the treaty: Rosas would remove the Argentine troops from Montevideo at the same time that France removed theirs, but keeping a portion of them during the first months of Oribe's rule to prevent anarchy; and Argentina would refer to Oribe in the document as "President of the Republic" while France would do so as "Brigadier General". Before leaving the city, the French vessel transporting Lepredour would also make a 21-gun salute to the flag of Argentina.
Historical perspectives.
The historical significance of the conflict is disputed between Argentine historians. Revisionist authors consider it a key event in the history of Argentina, next to the Argentine War of Independence, while traditional historians disagree. A recent example of this conflicting viewpoints took place in November 18, 2010, before the first celebration of the National Sovereignty day (in commemoration of the main battle of the conflict, the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado) as a national holiday. The newspaper La Nación interviewed revisionist historian Pacho O'Donnell, traditional historian Luis Alberto Romero and British historian David Rock.
Luis Alberto Romero considers that the importance of the battle is overrated because it was a defeat: the Anglo-French navy destroyed the artilleries and proceed to the north, as they wanted to do. The end of the blockade in favourable terms to the Confederation was more the result of a change of policy by the Foreign Office after the appointment of Lord Palmerston than a success of Rosas' diplomacy. Pacho O'Donnell considers that, even though the navy could force its way, it ultimately failed in its main purposes: they could not turn the Argentine mesopotamia into a new country, nor gain total control of the Parana River, nor establish their presence in the zone. David Rock concurs, but considers that it is exaggerated to treat the battle as an epic. He points that the number of casualties in it may be high in the context of the military history of Argentina, but not on a global scale, as it was nowhere near the 1916 Battle of the Somme, with more than 60,000 deaths in just half an hour.
Pacho O'Donnell considers as well that traditional historiography had concealed the battle of Vuelta de Obligado. Romero considers instead that, despite not giving it the higher importance, the battle is properly referenced at all the books about the time period.

Itamar attack

The Itamar attack, also called the Itamar massacre,
was an attack on a Jewish family in the Israeli settlement of Itamar in the West Bank that took place on 11 March 2011, in which five members of the same family were murdered in their beds. The victims were the father Ehud (Udi) Fogel, the mother Ruth Fogel, and three of their six children—Yoav, 11, Elad, 4, and Hadas, the youngest, a three-month-old infant. According to David Ha'ivri, and as reported by multiple sources the infant was decapitated. The settlement of Itamar had been the target of several murderous attacks before these killings.
Amjad Awad and Hakim Awad, two young Palestinian men from the village of Awarta, were arrested for the murders. On 5 June 2011 they were indicted on five counts of murder, stealing weapons, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to commit a crime. Both were later found guilty. They initially denied any involvement in the attack but later proudly confessed to the killings, expressed no remorse and reenacted the attack before security officials.
The attack was harshly condemned by the United Nations, the Quartet on the Middle East, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and many other governments, as well as the Palestinian Authority and a number of non-governmental organizations. "Xinhua", the official press agency of the People's Republic of China, stated that the attack was praised by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades stated that “the heroic operation is a natural response to the (Israeli) occupation crimes against our people in West Bank and Gaza Strip.” An opinion poll indicated that 63% of Palestinians opposed and about one-third supported the attack. One of the perpetrators of the murders was described as a "hero" and a "legend" by members of his family, during a weekly program.
Background.
Due to an increase in security measures by the Palestinian National Authority, operations by Palestinian militant organizations in the West Bank had been declining. Over the previous two years, Israel had removed a number of roadblocks and checkpoints, although a security fence remained in place around Itamar. The attack was the first killing of settlers since a drive-by shooting in August 2010 left four dead near Kiryat Arba. Attacks on Israeli settlements in the West Bank had been defended by some Palestinian militants on previous occasions, who argued that the settlers are "de facto" combatants in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Itamar, with a population of 1,032 (2009), mostly ideologically motivated national-religious Israeli-Jewish families considered among the most fervent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, has had numerous confrontations with local Palestinians. Tensions between Itamar and the nearby Palestinian village of Awarta had been rising before the attack. Palestinians had accused settlers in the locality of cutting down hundreds of olive trees, burning cars and shooting at Palestinian residents. Ten Palestinians and one settler were injured in a confrontation in the week before the attack, when Israeli soldiers were accused of opening fire to quell the clash, and two Palestinian teenagers had been shot to death a year previously as they collected garbage near Itamar.
Perpetrators.
The attack was carried out by Amjad Mahmad Awad, 18, and Hakim Mazen Awad, 17. Both are from the Awad clan, which makes up about half of Awarta's population, and are cousins. Hakim Mazen Awad was a high school student whose father, Mazen, is active in the PFLP. Mazen had previously been arrested and tried by the Palestinian Authority and had served a five-year prison sentence for murdering a female cousin and burning her body. His uncle Jibril was also a PFLP militant who had participated in a 2002 attack against Itamar which left four civilians dead, including three children, along with the settlement's security officer, and was killed in a 2003 clash with Israeli troops. Amjad Mahmad Awad was also affiliated with the PFLP. He had been employed in Israel as a laborer, and was a student at Al-Quds Open University. The families of the two suspects denied the two committed the massacre. Hakim Awad's mother, Nawef, claimed that her son was at home the night of the murder and never left the house, claiming that "five months ago Hakim underwent a surgery in his stomach and I'm sure he was tortured and forced into confessing," though she later proudly admitted his involvement. Amjad's family also claimed that he was in the village at the time of the event. One relative said that Hakim and Amjad did not know each other, as "one went to university, the other is in high school". He also claimed that if they had been guilty, they would have been captured within days, as "the whole world knows about Israel's advanced investigation abilities and its use of sophisticated means". Shin Bet, however, claimed that in spite of the time passed between the murders and arrests, it was a major achievement.
Amjad and Hakim Awad had decided to carry out an attack on Itamar days before. Three days before the killings, they approached a PFLP member with a request for weapons, but were rebuffed. At midday on Friday, 11 March, they decided that they would enter Itamar later that night, and carry out an attack armed with knives.
Several media sources, among them the "Guardian" and the "Washington Post", first reported that the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of Fatah, the dominant political faction in the West Bank, claimed responsibility for the attack,
</ref> whereas the "Jerusalem Post" reported, that the "Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades of Imad Mughniyeh" had claimed responsibility, a group named after a Hezbollah chief of military operations and liaison with the Iranian Revolutionary Guards who was killed by a car bomb in Damascus in 2008. According to "Al Hayat", officials of "Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades" denied association with the Imad Mughniyeh-group or the attack.
"The Jerusalem Post" reported that a number of media outlets affiliated with the Palestinian Authority doubted Israeli claims that the killings were committed by Palestinians and report that a Thai worker who was employed in the settlement had been arrested on suspicion of the killings.
Amjad and Hakim Awad were already in custody when they were identified as the killers, and their names released to the public on April 17. They offered a detailed account of the attack, as well as a reenactment. Despite the ties of both suspects to the PFLP, Shin Bet investigators did not identify the attack as being carried out under the auspices of the PFLP, but rather as an individual act. Israeli authorities said that they planned their attack well ahead of time, and showed no remorse for their actions.
The attack.
According to Israeli investigators, Amjad and Hakim Awad had attempted to acquire weapons from a Popular Front militant in Awarta. After he refused, they decided to carry out the attack using knives. Just after 9 pm on Friday night, the two left Awarta carrying several knives, an umbrella, and wire-cutting shears. The two tried to cut through the settlement's security fence, but eventually climbed over it. An initial probe showed that the fence around Itamar functioned properly. At about the same time that they infiltrated, an alarm sounded in the settlement's security room, indicating the exact location where they entered. But neither the settlement's civilian security team nor the civilian security officer, who went to the site of the disturbance and found nothing out of order, informed soldiers patrolling the area of the fence, concluding that an animal had set off the alarm, although procedures prescribe that the IDF is to be informed of any alarm.
After crossing the fence, Amjad and Hakim walked 400 meters into the settlement. The perpetrators first broke into a house of the Chai family who were on vacation, searching all the rooms. They stole an M-16 assault rifle, ammunition, a helmet, and a kevlar vest. They waited an hour and entered the Fogels' house at around 10:30 pm. According to the indictment, the two entered the children's room, told eleven-year-old Yoav, who had been awakened by their entry not to be afraid, then took him to a nearby room, slashed his throat, and stabbed him in the chest. Hakim Awad then strangled four-year-old Elad with Amjad Awad stabbing him twice in the chest. The two next entered the parents' room, and turned on the light, waking them up. The parents then struggled with the attackers. Ehud Fogel was repeatedly stabbed in the neck, and Ruth Fogel was stabbed in the neck and back and then shot when the suspects saw that she was not dead. The suspects then left the house. According to the confessions of the suspects, they feared that the shots had been heard. When they went outside, they saw a patrol vehicle, but realized that they had not been discovered when it did nothing. The two then argued over whether to withdraw or carry out attacks in other homes, with Hakim insisting that they return immediately to Awarta, and Amjad arguing that they should return to the home and steal another weapon. Amjad then re-entered the Fogel home. When 3-month old Hadas began crying, Amjad stabbed her, fearing the cries would attract attention. According to several accounts, the infant was decapitated., though one source says that although her throat was deeply slit, she was only "nearly decapitated". The attackers did not notice two other children asleep in the house at the time. In their confessions they said and that they would not have hesitated to kill them if they had noticed them. The perpetrators also stole Ehud's M-16 rifle. They left the settlement without being detected.
Amjad and Hakim Awad returned to Awarta on foot, and appealed to Hakim's uncle, PFLP militant Salah Awad, for assistance, and gave him a detailed description of the attack. Salah helped them conceal their stolen weapons and burn their bloodstained clothes, and later transferred the stolen weapons to Jad Avid, a contact in Ramallah for hiding.
The bodies were discovered by Tamar Fogel, the 12-year-old daughter of the family who arrived home around midnight after a youth outing. After finding that the door was locked, she asked her neighbor, Rabbi Ya'akov Cohen, for help. He noticed tracks and mud near the house, and brought a weapon with him. The two then woke the sleeping 6-year old boy by calling through the window, and he opened the door, after which Cohen returned to his home. When the girl discovered the murders, she ran outside screaming, and the Rabbi ran back, firing several shots into the air to alert security personnel. Rabbi Cohen, who later entered the house with the girl, said that her two-year-old brother "was lying next to his bleeding parents, shaking them with his hands and trying to get them to wake up, while crying... The sight in the house was shocking." Magen David Adom paramedics and ZAKA (Disaster Victim Identification) volunteers were called to the scene, including ZAKA regional commander Gil Bismot. Paramedics followed a trail of toys and blood to the bedroom, where they discovered the first three bodies: the mother, father and infant. In the next room they found the body of the 11-year-old sibling. Finally they reached the last bedroom, where the 4-year-old boy was severely injured and dying. The toddler died of his wounds despite the efforts of medical personnel.
In accordance with Jewish law, the bodies remained in the home throughout Jewish Sabbath, watched over by ZAKA volunteers. Immediately after the end of Sabbath, another team of ZAKA volunteers arrived from Immanuel and the wider region were dispatched to Itamar. ZAKA volunteers collected all human remains and cleaned up the scene. Dr. Yehuda Hiss of the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute in Tel Aviv traveled to Itamar to carry out an examination of the bodies. The procedure was supervised by the head of the ZAKA Rabbinical Council, Rabbi Ya'akov Roget.
Victims.
The victims of the attack are Ehud "Udi" Fogel, age 36, the son of Gush Emunim activists from Neve Tzuf, Ruth Fogel, age 35, the daughter of a Jerusalem rabbi, and three of their six children, Yoav, age 11, Elad, age 4, and three months old Hadas.
The Fogel family had recently settled in Itamar. They previously lived in the Gush Katif settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip. After Israel evacuated its Gaza settlements in 2005, they moved to the settlement of Ariel, and in 2009 to Itamar, where Udi Fogel worked as teacher at the post-high school yeshiva.
Three of the family's children, Tamar, age 12, Roi, age 6, and Yishai, age 2 have survived physically unharmed. They are being cared for by grandparents in the aftermath of the attack. Twelve-year-old Tamar is quoted as having promised her relatives: "I will be strong and succeed in overcoming this. I understand the task that stands before me, and I will be a mother to my siblings."
Funeral.
The funeral of the five victims on Sunday, 13 March at Har HaMenuchot Cemetery in Givat Shaul, Jerusalem, was attended by some 20,000 people and broadcast on Israeli television. Speakers included former Chief Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau, quoted as saying: "We will not bend, we will not give up, we returned to the land of our fathers and it is our home, and the children shall return within their borders and nothing will prevent our faith in the righteousness of our path", Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yona Metzger, who, linking the murderers to Amalek, stated that "Itamar needs to become a major city in Israel as a response to this murder", and Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin, whose final remarks were: "Build more, live more, more footholds – that is our response to the murderers so that they know – they can't defeat us".
Ruth Fogel's father was quoted as having said: "Our children are prepared to be sacrificed as an offering at the altar we have to continue to build to bring redemption. Udi and Ruthie wanted this redemption."
Udi Fogel's brother Motti Fogel spoke out against the use that has been made of the murder of the family: "All the slogans about Torah and settlement, the Land of Israel and the people of Israel are attempts to forget the simple and pain-torn fact: you are dead. You are dead, and no slogan will bring you back. You are not a symbol or a national event. Your life was a purpose in and of itself, and it should be forbidden for your terrible death to turn your life into some sort of tool."</ref>
Following the end of the 30-day mourning period, an emotional memorial service was held in Itamar, where the cornerstone for a new kollel to be named after Udi Fogel was laid. Hundreds of people attended, including Sephardi Chief Rabbi Moshe Amar, Knesset members Tzipi Hotovely (Likud) and Uri Ariel (National Union), and Yesha Council Chairman Danny Dayan. Many participants signed a Megillah scroll, which was recited by former Military Rabbinate Chief and Yeshiva head Avichai Rontzki before being placed within the foundations of the new kollel.
Manhunt and capture.
Following the attack, soldiers from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Police arrived in Itamar and conducted a search across the village of Itamar. The Israeli Air Force used UAVs for aerial surveillance of the area. Israeli authorities declared the nearby West Bank city of Nablus a closed military zone. Israeli troops set up checkpoints on the roads leading to the city and prevented vehicles and pedestrians from leaving or entering, according to Palestinians. Residential areas were placed under curfew, and Israeli troops conducted house-to-house searches. The previously-dismantled Huwwara Checkpoint was re-established. 
An initial probe suggested two perpetrators entered Itamar shortly after 9 pm, jumping over the settlement's security fence, and remained in the settlement for three hours without being noticed. Due to the characteristics of the killings, the IDF estimated that the attack was not carried out by an organized terrorist infrastructure but was the work of one or two people, presumably Palestinian. Israeli authorities initially suspected that the killings may have been in revenge for the killing of two Palestinian teenagers from Awarta, who were shot dead near Itamar in 2010.
In Itamar, the Fogel family home was cordoned off by red tape and guarded by soldiers. A forensics team probed the home, collecting evidence left behind by the killers.
An IDF tracker spotted indications that the perpetrators had scaled the fence, and found footprints and equipment abandoned by the killers leading out of Itamar. The tracker, accompanied by an IDF force, followed the tracks to the Palestinian village of Awarta. IDF troops entered the town of Burqa, northwest of Nablus, searching houses and questioning residents. They did not make any arrests. IDF soldiers and Israel Border Police gendarmes also entered the villages of Sanur and Zababdeh, arresting several dozen Palestinians.
A gag order was imposed on the investigation.
Awarta was placed under curfew and declared a closed military zone. IDF troops and Israel Border Police conducted mass arrests of residents throughout the following days. According to Palestinian sources, all men from Awarta were questioned. Residents reported constant door-to-door searches, with some homes being searched up to three times. According to witness reports, Israeli armored vehicles patrolled the village's streets, and troops were deployed on the hilltops around the village. The city of Nablus remained under closure, but four days after the murders, a food delivery was permitted into the city. On 29 March 2011, the IDF initiated a second wave of arrests in Awarta, detaining 60 Palestinians, including the Deputy Mayor of Awarta, and collecting DNA samples. About 20 were immediately released following DNA testing, and another 40 were interrogated. A week later, AFP reported that the IDF arrested more than 100 women from the village, placing them in a camp where they were fingerprinted and DNA samples were taken, before most of them were released.</ref>
On 11 April, daily IDF raids continued in the village, and troops continued to maintain roadblocks at the entrance. According to allegations by Israeli leftists and Awarta residents, soldiers humiliated residents and damaged property. Palestinian officials claimed that Israel had seized land around the village to expand nearby settlements. The Palestinian Authority condemned the raids and called on the international community to pressure Israel into halting them.
Shin Bet questioned numerous Awarta villagers who had been arrested, with some residents who had been arrested and released being again questioned by Shin Bet investigators. Meanwhile, the IDF also questioned residents in various parts of Awarta. The interrogations produced various leads, but slowly, the circle of potential suspects was narrowed. At this stage, the IDF's elite Duvdevan Unit and the Israel Police's special undercover unit began making secret arrests of suspects, and interrogations of the suspects produced additional intelligence information. Hakim Awad was arrested on 5 April, but only started to cooperate after more information pointed to him. Amjad Awad was arrested on 10 April. Forensic evidence gathered from the Fogel family home linked them to the killings. The two were identified as the perpetrators, and kept in custody pending trial. On 17 April, it was officially cleared for publication that Amjad and Hakim Awad had been identified as the killers. Both suspects confessed to the killings and offered a detailed account. They expressed no remorse for their actions, and performed a reenactment of the attack before security officials. Amjad Awad declared that he was proud of what he did and had no regrets, even if he was sentenced to death.
Subsequently, Hakim's father, two uncles, and brother were arrested for hiding the murder weapons and suppressing additional evidence. Israeli security forces also arrested the PFLP militant who they had approached for weapons, and raided the Ramallah home of Yazed Hassan Mohammed Awad, Salah Awad's contact who had hidden the two stolen assault rifles following the attack. Both of the assault rifles were found in his home. In addition, Yazed Awad was found to have briefed Amjad and Hakim on Shin Bet interrogation teqniques. He was arrested, and in December 2012 was convicted by a military court.
Trial and conviction.
On 26 May 2011, the Judea and Samaria Sector Military Court extended the remand of Amjad Mahmad Awad and Hakim Mazen Awad for eleven days. The Military Prosecution informed the court that it would file an official indictment at their next arraignment.
The Military Prosecution considered requesting the death penalty, due to the extreme nature of the attack.
On 5 June 2011, Amjad and Hakim Awad were indicted before the Judea and Samaria Sector Military Court on five counts of murder, stealing weapons, breaking and entering, and conspiracy to commit a crime. The suspects confessed to the murder and the military prosecution in the case presented forensic evidence linking them to the scene of the crime, including DNA samples and fingerprints. According to a senior Shin Bet official involved in the investigation, despite the suspects' young age, Hakim and Amjad "described what they did with self-control and did not express regret over their actions at any stage of the investigation." Amjad told reporters in the court "I don't regret what I did and I would do it again. I'm proud of what I did and I'll accept any punishment I get, even death, because I did it all for Palestine."
Hakim Awad was found guilty on five counts of murder in August 2011. He was also convicted for weapons-related and other security offenses. In September 2011 he was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences and another five years in prison. Prior to the sentencing Awad declared he was not sorry and claimed he carried out the attack "because of the occupation." In October 2011, Amjad Awad pled guilty to five counts of murder. Before deciding whether to convict him, the judges examined the primary evidence. The judges seriously considered imposing the death penalty, but decided not to seek a harsher sentence than what the prosecution had requested. On January 16, 2012, he was sentenced to five life terms and an additional seven years in prison.
Responses.
Israel.
In response to the Itamar attack, on 13 March, the Israeli cabinet approved the construction of 500 housing units in Gush Etzion, Ma'ale Adumim, Ariel and Modi'in Illit, areas of the West Bank that Israel intends to keep under any permanent accord with the Palestinians. The decision was taken in a late-night cabinet meeting in which both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak took part, after several alternatives, such as starting a new settlement or widening the settlement of Itamar, were rejected. The decision was criticized by the Palestinians and the United States. A spokesperson from the U.S. State Department told the "Jewish Week" that the "United States is deeply concerned by continuing Israeli actions with respect to settlements in the West Bank" and that "ontinued Israeli settlements are illegitimate and run counter to efforts to resume direct negotiations."
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visiting relatives of the victims, told the mourners: "They shoot and we build." Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman voiced his opposition to imposing the death penalty on the perpetrators, saying that Israel "should not be guided by revenge."
On 4 April 2011, a new bill was proposed by MK Yoel Hasson (Kadima) to keep murderers of children from being included in prisoner exchanges and allowing them to be pardoned by the President at any future date.
In the aftermath of the attack, Israeli military and police forces were deployed near Nablus to prevent clashes.
According to Palestinian sources and the BBC, Israeli settlers vandalized property near Nablus, Hebron, Bethlehem and Ramallah in revenge for the Fogel murders. They also reportedly handed out threatening leaflets in Beitillu, near Ramallah, blocked a junction in Gush Etzion and threw stones at Palestinians. Several were arrested by IDF and police forces deployed on the scene. Israeli activists blocked an intersection near Psagot on Highway 60. According to the Palestinians, residents of Bat Ayin took part in a protest at which the Israeli police fired tear gas. Settlers near Nablus and Kedumim area reportedly stoned and burned Palestinian vehicles, and blocked the Jit Junction. Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh, Rosh Yeshiva of the Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva in Yitzhar, is said to have called for houses in a nearby village to be demolished.
On March 13, Israelis protested at the Horev, Tzabar, Megiddo, and Azrieli Junctions, carrying signs proclaiming "we are settlers too" and "peace isn't signed with blood." Drivers honked their car horns in solidarity. Right-wing activists protested near Jerusalem and Bar-Ilan University students held at rally near Highway 4, chanting "enough to violence and incitement – talk to humans not murderers".
On 14 March, settlers clashed with Palestinians near Nablus, which ended after Israeli troops dispersed the Palestinians with live fire. An Israeli settler and ten Palestinians were wounded during the clashes. Three days later, two Palestinian workers employed in Shilo were attacked by masked men armed with iron rods and pepper spray, as was an Israeli securtiy guard who attempted to protect them.
On 16 March, 200 settlers marched from Itamar to Awarta. Fourteen marchers entered the village and threw stones at homes. IDF soldiers and Border Police gendarmes dispersed the rioters. Some marched up a hill near Itamar to support the construction of a new Israeli outpost there.
An opinion poll conducted by the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found, according to the groups, "In light of the attack in Itamar, 59% among Israelis oppose and 33% support the government policy to relax the security measures in the West Bank such as the removal of road blocks." The groups asked 601 adult Israelis interviewed by phone in Hebrew, Arabic, or Russian between 21 and 28 March 2011.
On 16 March "Haaretz" reported that residents of Itamar were building a new outpost, unofficially named "Aryeh." "Aryeh" is Hebrew for "lion", as well as an approximate acronym for the names Udi, Ruth, Yoav, Elad and Hadas, the five victims of the attack. On 1 December, Aryeh was demolished by Israeli Civil Administration personnel backed by IDF troops and police officers. During the demolition operation, three permanent structures, two makeshift structures and a synagogue were razed. A control panel and the electricity system that powered a security camera purchased by the Shomron Regional Council were also destroyed, and a security official claimed that the electric system was illegal and was destroyed to protect Civil Administration personnel from being electrocuted. Settlers claimed that three Torah scrolls were confiscated.
Palestinians.
Palestinians threw stones at buses returning from the funeral of the victims. Some Palestinian residents of the village of Awarta, who had previously clashed with settlers from Itamar for a number of years, denounced the killings.
A paramedic interviewed in an Israeli newspaper stated that on the day of the attack, settlers saw fireworks and celebrations in nearby Palestinian communities. In the Gaza Strip, the killings sparked celebrations in the city of Rafah, where Palestinians handed out candy and sweets on the streets. A resident described the celebrations as "a natural response to the harm settlers inflict on the Palestinian residents in the West Bank".
MEMRI, commenting on reactions to the murders in the Palestinian media, stated that while Sawsan Al-Barghouti, a columnist for a website affiliated with Hamas, called the Itamar murders a "heroic act", in the rest of the Palestinian media the murder of children ("even of settlers") was strongly condemned as unequivocally immoral and contrary to Palestinian values, and as doing nothing to help the Palestinian cause. One editorial, for example, stated: "Stabbing an infant to death is a crime against humanity. Whoever did this was insane, or charged with racist assumptions. This is not nationalist; there is no connection between the murder of the infant in the settlement of Itamar and the values of our people's struggle." Many questioned whether such a murderer could be Palestinian. The PLO condemned the murders and accused Israel of jumping to the conclusion that the perpetrator was Palestinian and of exploiting the tragedy for its own political gains. A Haaretz article also reported that Palestinians in newspapers and on social networking sites condemned the attack while also criticizing settlers and the Israeli government's declaration of new settlement units in retaliation.
An opinion poll conducted by the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 63% of Palestinians surveyed opposed the attack while 32% supported it. The groups interviewed 1,270 adults face-to-face in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip from 17 to 19 March 2011.
In January 2012, Palestinian Authority television aired an interview with the mother and aunt of Hakim Awad, who praised him as "a hero" and "a legend". Hakim's mother Nawef, who had previously denied her son's involvement, now proudly admitted it. The broadcast was part of a weekly show focusing on Palestinian prisoners in Israel.
On February 1, 2012, the Tomb of Eleazar was found spray-painted with Arabic slogans praising the perpetrators. The vandalism was discovered by 500 Jewish worshippers and their IDF escorts during a pilgrimage to the site. Soldiers and worshippers then covered the tomb with white paint to mask the graffiti.
American.
A memorial service for the Fogel family was held at New York's Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun a week after the attack. It was attended by 1,000 local residents, with 2,000 more viewing a live broadcast over the internet. President of the New York Board of Rabbis Rabbi Yaakov Kermaier said of the victims that they "were treated as criminals for settling and building beautiful lives in the heartland of our ancestral holy land." Pastor of the Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem, Reverend Jacques DeGraff, told the gathered mourners, "I'm here today because it is not enough for the friends of Israel to issue a statement." The service was jointly sponsored by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, the Consulate General of Israel in New York, the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, the UJA-Federation of New York, and Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun.
Gary Rosenblatt, editor-in-chief of "The Jewish Week", commented that reactions to the Itamar killings may have been more muted given that the victims were religious Israelis living in a small West Bank settlement. He stated that if the victims had been secular Jews living inside the Green Line "outrage would have been far greater".
Italian.
A delegation of Italian Jews from Rome visited Itamar on 30 March and extended a donation of €25,000 to support the three surviving children of the Fogel family. President of the Jewish community of Rome Riccardo Pacifici said, "We come with a message of solidarity and support."
Finnish.
A team of Finnish performers wrote a song in memory of the Fogel family for the annual Benei Akiva Jewish Eurovision contest, held this year in Rome, Italy. The team was inspired by the fact that daughter Tamar Fogel's life was spared owing to her being out of the house at the time of the attack, attending a Benei Akiva event.
Commemoration.
In February 2012, more than 1,000 members of the Likud party visited Itamar and planted 1,500 trees in memory of the Fogel family victims as part of annual Tu Bishvat festivities throughout Israel.

Treaty of Niš (1923)

The Treaty of Niš (, ) was a treaty signed on 23 March 1923 by the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the Kingdom of Bulgaria which obliged the Kingdom of Bulgaria to suppress the operations of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) carried out from Bulgarian territory. As a result of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine Bulgaria was in a grave situation having lost territory to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Greece and Romania and the right to maintain an army of no more than 20,000 combined with heavy reparations to those countries. The treaty was an attempt to normalize relations with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and gain its support on the Bulgarian claims to Western Thrace and Southern Dobruja but knowing the Bulgarian weakness the latter reduced the negotiations to technical issues and the Bulgarian responsibilities to fight the IMRO.
Treaty.
The treaty was signed after its text was first discussed and agreed at the Conference of Niš held in period 1—17 March 1923. There was a leak of information through which the IMRO was informed about the preparation of the treaty during the conference in Niš. The treaty was signed by Aleksandar Stamboliyski on behalf of Kingdom of Bulgaria. By this treaty Bulgaria undertook the obligation to suppress the operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory.
The treaty become known to the public on 7 May 1923 after the ordinance of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria.
Aftermath.
Based on the informations that "leaked" during the Niš Conference, the IMRO undertook immediate measures, based on a secret circular letter № 384, to create a second subsidiary organization in the border revolutionary districts in the Macedonia. The plan of the Central Committee was to move the second subsidiary organization and members away from Bulgaria and by that to preserve the organization and members in case the Bulgarian government undertook repressive measures. Three days after the conference in Niš was over, Todor Aleksandrov took new precautions and prepared constitutive documents to a new secret structure called Railway Secret Organization (RSO) as a new subsidiary organization of IMRO.
The IMRO had a prominent role in assassinating Aleksandar Stamboliyski due to his signing of the Treaty of Niš. The assassins also cut off his hand, representing their opposition to his signing of the Treaty of Niš.

Rank in Judo

In Judo, improvement and understanding of the art is denoted by a system of ranks split into "kyū" and "dan" grades. These are indicated with various systems of coloured belts, with the black belt indicating a practitioner who has attained a certain level of competence.
The Kōdōkan Kyū-Dan ranking system.
This ranking system was introduced by Kanō Jigorō, the founder of judo, in 1883 and the first "dan" grades were awarded to his students Saigō Shirō and Tomita Tsunejirō. Since then it has been widely adopted by modern martial arts.
As initially designed, there were six student grades ranked in descending numerical order. Beginners were given the rank of and wore a light blue belt. Once they had passed an elementary level of instruction, they were promoted to , when they would adopt the white belt. This they wore through . The remaining three grades (, and were all indicated with brown belts (for seniors) or with purple belts (for juniors).
1st "kyū" is the last kyu rank before promotion to first degree black belt ("shodan"). There are ordinarily 10 "dan" ranks, which are ranked in ascending numerical order, though in principle there is no limit to the number of "dan" ranks.
Highest ranking jūdōka.
Kōdōkan graded jū-dans.
The ninth ("kudan") and tenth degree black belt ("jūdan") and, theoretically, those higher have no formal requirements. Only fifteen individuals have been promoted to the rank of Kodokan 10th dan. On January 6, 2006, three individuals were promoted to this rank simultaneously: Toshiro Daigo, Ichiro Abe, and Yoshimi Osawa. This is the most ever at the same time, and the first in 22 years. No one has ever been promoted to a rank higher than 10th "dan", but theoretically the Judo rank system is not limited to 10 degrees of black belt. The original English language copy (1955) of Illustrated Kodokan Judo, by Jigoro Kano, says:
However, since there has never been any promotion to a rank above 10th dan, the Kodokan Judo promotion system effectively has only 10 dan ranks. There have only been 15 10th dans awarded by the Kodokan in the history of Judo.
Variations in rank structure.
Although "dan" ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the "kyū" grades, with some countries having more "kyū" grades. Although initially "kyū" grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a Dan rank in the 1880s. Initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in kimono, only white and black obi were used. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the judogi, that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created.
Belt colors.
"See" List of judoka
For "dan" ranks, the first five are colored black, 6th, 7th, and 8th "dan" have alternating red and white panels (dandara), and for 9th, 10th and 11th "dan" the belts are solid red. The final Dan is the twelfth dan, this is usually coloured white along with a judoka's first belt, however the highest dan reached in judo remains 10th dan. However, holders of grades above "godan" (5th "dan") will often wear a plain black belt in regular training.
Some countries also use colored tips on belts, to indicate junior age groups. Historically, women's belts had a white stripe along the centre.
Examination requirements vary depending on country, age group and of course the grade being attempted. The examination itself may include competition and kata. The "kyū" ranks are normally awarded by local instructors ("sensei"), but "dan" ranks are usually awarded only after an exam supervised by independent judges from a national judo association. For a rank to be recognized, it must be registered with the national judo organization or the Kodokan. 
Japan.
In Japan, the use of belt colors is related to the age of the student. Some clubs will only have black and white, others will include a brown belt for advanced kyū grades and at the elementary school level it is common to see a green belt for intermediate levels.
Israel.
Israely belt rankings are sometimes white , white-yellow , yellow , yellow-orange , orange , orange-green , green , green-blue , blue , blue-brown, brown and black when 6th, 7th, and 8th dan may wear alternating red and white panels, and 9th and 10th dan holders may wear solid red belts,but usally between the white and the white-yellow belt they are two other belts: white-purple,purple. Newly a yellow-purple belt was created between yellow and yellow-orange,

Brazil.
Brazilian belt rankings are normally white, blue, yellow, orange, green, purple, brown and black (6th, 7th, and 8th dan may wear alternating red and white panels, and 9th and 10th dan holders may wear solid red belts). Additionally, a grey belt may be given to very young judoka (under 11 or 13 years old) just before the blue. Sometimes, competitors are organized into two categories depending on grading; the first is from white to green, and the second is purple through black.
Canada.
In Canada belt rankings for Seniors are, in ascending order: white, yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and finally black. Belt rankings for Juniors use white-red, white, white-yellow, yellow, yellow-orange, orange, red- green, green-blue, blue, blue-brown, and brown.
Ireland.
In Ireland the senior belt system is white,yellow,orange,green,blue,brown and black. A practitioner must be at least sixteen before being eligible to grade for blackbelt. For white,yellow,orange and green belt gradings are held in the practitioners club and are based on demonstration of a syllabus and kata. For promotion to blue and brown the judoka must compete at a national grading against players of their own rank and win at least two fights by ippon or wazari. To achieve black belt a judoka must earn 100 points i.e. 10 points for every ippon or wazari victory against a brown belt.
United States of America.
In the US only senior players (adults, usually those age 16 and over) are allowed to earn "dan" levels, signified by wearing a black belt. The USJF and USJA recognize "dan" grades awarded by the other organization. Advanced "kyū" levels can be earned by both seniors and juniors (children under the age of about 16) and are signified by wearing belts of various colours other than black. The order of belt colours can vary from dojo to dojo, depending on the dojo's organizational affiliation.
Seniors.
For senior players, both the United States Judo Federation (USJF)
and ) the United States Judo Association (USJA)
specify six "kyū", as listed in the table. The USJA requires "Beginners" (not a kyū) to wear a white belt until they test for yellow belt. The USJA also recommends wearing a patch specifying the practitioner's level. This is true for both "kyū" and "dan" levels.
Juniors.
The USJF Juniors ranking system specifies ranks to 11th "kyū" ("jūichikyū"). The USJA Juniors ranking system specifies twelve levels of "kyū" rank, beginning with "Junior 1st Degree" (equivalent to "jūnikyū", or 12th "kyū") and ending with "Junior 12th Degree" (equivalent to "ikkyū"). As with the senior practitioners, the USJA recommends that juniors wear a patch specifying their rank.
When a USJA Junior reaches the age of 17, their conversion to Senior rank is:

Wallace's Monument, Ayrshire

Wallace's Monument, the Wallace Tower, or the Barnweill Monument (NS 240655 629488) is a category-A-listed folly dedicated to the memory of William Wallace located on Barnweill Hill (503ft), a prominent location in the Parish of Craigie, South Ayrshire, Scotland.
History.
Purpose and origins.
The Wallace Monument is a picturesque Gothic structure and is in a prominent situation, built to commemorate William Wallace at the time of an upsurge in the Scottish desire for self-determination, predating the 1869 Wallace Monument at Stirling. The story is that the name derives from an occasion when Wallace, standing on this elevated site, remarked that the Barns of Ayr (containing English soldiers) `burn weil' is an invention, the reason for the name actually being that it is situated close to the remains of the medieval parish church of Barnweill, a parish that suppressed in the 17th century.
The Ayr Advertiser of 12 October 1854 carried an advertisement calling for designs for the monument to be submitted to W F Love of Beith by 1 January 1855. The Ayr Advertiser of 30 October 1856 stated that the monument was designed by William Dobie of Beith, and was built by Mr Snodgrass. The Dobies were a well-to-do professional family with antiquarian interests. No evidence has been found of any call for public subscription. Robert Snodgrass senior, son of William Snodgrass, mason of Beith, practised as an architect-builder in Beith. The land was donated by Brigadier-General James George Smith-Neil of Barnweill House in 1855.
William Patrick of Roughwood and Woodside near Beith is also said to have erected the monument. Dobie states that after repeated attempts to "arouse public sympathy in its favour" he built the tower at his own expense.
Etymology.
The name, also used as Barnwell, Barnweil and Burnweill, first recorded as "Berenbouell" circa 1177-1204 and "Brenwyfle" in 1306, is one of a cluster of names in this area that contains the Cymric place-name element pren-, meaning 'tree'.
Architecture.
Robert Snodgrass senior in 1855-7, built a square plan Gothic tower from polished sanstone ashlar blocks, 3-stage, 12 feet wide at the base, sixty feet high, with pinnacled parapet. Base course; string courses; corbelled, shouldered band course between 2nd and 3rd stages; machicolated, crenellated parapet with thistle-finialled, conical-capped circular angle pinnacles and ball-finialled, ogee-capped square-plan wallhead pinnacles. Diagonally-boarded timber door in Tudor-arched, roll-moulded doorway with hoodmould to the south-east elevation; similar inscription recesses at other elevations. Round-arched recesses at 2nd stage; paired round-arched recesses at 3rd stage.
A spiral staircase leads up to the viewing platform and the arms of the Wallace family are blazoned in bas-relief above the entrance door.
Inscriptions.
Tower base.
On three sides are single bronze panels bearing rousing proclamations of Wallace's virtues and misfortunes :
Side 1 - ""Erected MCCCCLV., in honour of Scotland's greatest national hero, the renowned Sir William Wallace, born MCCLXX., who after performing numerous exploits of the most consumate bravery in defence of the independence of his country was basely betrayed into the hands of his enemies by whom, to their everlasting disgrace, he was unjustifiably put to death on the XXII. of August, MCCC. Centuries have not dimmed the lustre of his heroic achievements; and the memory of this most disinterested of patriots shall through all ages be honoured and revered by his countrymen.""
Side 2 - ""Sir William wallace, Regent of Scotland, MCCXCVII. In resistance to treacherous invasion, and in defence of the laws and liberties of his country, he fought against fearful odds the desperate battles of Biggar, Stirling, Blackearnside, and Falkirk, and between these actions, in little more than a year, he stormed and took from the invaders very fortress, castle, and town which they had seized in the Kingdom. Though worsted at Falkirk by overwhelming numbers, aided by fatal dissensions in his own army, he continued warring with the oppressors of his native land until his foul betrayal, seven years after that disastrous battle, by the execrable Monteith.""
""Ever honoured be the memory of the matchless Sir William wallace, the first of his countrymen who in an age of despair arose and" 
"throw off the yoke of foreign oppression, and maintain the independence and nationality of Scotland; and who, by deeds of surpassing valour and stainless patriotism, has glorified this his native land, and imperishably associated his name with the defence of national rights and the liberties and immunities of freeborn men. From Greece arose Leonidas, from Scotland Wallace, and from America Washington - names which shall remain through all time the watchwords and beacons of liberty.""
Tower summit.
Cut into the stonework at the top of the tower are the words ""The Barns o' Ayr burn weel""
Environs.
The tower stands in a circular enclosed area of ground with a group of trees surviving from the original extensive plantings. At the gate of the plot once stood a neat lodge where the towers warden or guide lived. In Archibald Adamson's time (1875) a "Visitors' book" existed. The OS Maps indicate that the lodge stood until the 1970s, however no remains are now extant. The view from the tower battlements is of the town of Ayr, the site of Coilsfield House, Rosemount, Tarbolton, Arran, Kilmarnock, and the Carrick Hills.
Ownership and access.
The tower was not provided with an endowment by its builders and became the responsibility of the Ayr Town Council and its successor, South Ayrshire Council. At first, as stated, a guide was employed to show visitors around, later the key was available from nearby Barnweill Hill Farm, then the monument could be accessed by arrangement with South Ayrshire Council. At present the tower is closed, although a 'Tourist' road sign exists to direct visitors to view the site. No car park exists.
Micro-history.
For many years the flag on the tower was flown at half mast on 25 September, the day on which General Neil of Barnweil was killed.

Maine School Administrative District 63

Maine School Administrative District 63 (MSAD 63) is an operating school district within Penobscot County, Maine, covering the towns of Holden, Eddington, and Clifton. There are three schools in the district. Two are kindergarten-through-fourth grade elementary schools and are located in the towns of Holden and Eddington. The Eddington school also serves children from Clifton. The middle school is also located in Holden and services all three towns through eighth grade. It also contains CSD 8, or 'Airline', which serves the towns of Amherst, Aurora, Great Pond and Osborne. Together, these two districts are referred to as AOS 81.
Students must leave the district for high school as SAD 63 does not have one. The district pays the tuition for students to attend one of several area public and private schools. This allows area children to attend private schools that would otherwise be very costly for minimal or no cost. Most students attend the regional public school, Brewer High School, with the second most popular choice being the private John Bapst Memorial High School.

Coming Back Down

"Coming Back Down" is a song by American rock band Hollywood Undead, the third single from their second full-length album, "American Tragedy", and the tenth track on that album. It is the band's ninth overall single in their discography. The track was released as a promotional single and free download on the band's official website on January 11, 2011. It was later released as a single on March 15, along with another single, "Been to Hell". A remix was featured on the band's "American Tragedy Redux" remix album.
Background.
The track was initially sent to radio stations on February 24, 2011, as a promotional single for their second album, "American Tragedy". The unofficial track was soon leaked afterwards, with rumors of Kevin Rudolf being a featured artist. It was later revealed Rudolf was a producer for the track along with Jacob Kasher and Jeff Halavacs, with Don Gilmore as executive producer. On March 15, the band released the song as the third official single following Hear Me Now, with Been to Hell also being released as a single the same day. As a video was shot for "Been to Hell", "Coming Back Down" has yet to receive a music video. Lyrically, "Coming Back Down" centers on the story of an unknown loved one who has recently died, with the narrator having difficulty trying to live without them. The chorus is sung by Danny, with the first verse being rapped by J-Dog and the second being rapped by Johnny 3 Tears.
Brian Voerding noted that the song showed the band's strength in both singing and rapping while comparing the sound to Linkin Park, noting that, "The song bolsters the outfit as a force in rap rock with its sampled guitar riffs and swirling synths." Voerding also compared the production to that of Kid Rock mixed with pop-punk bands. He concluded by praising the lyrics, saying, "There's a spirituality in the lyrics, swollen with defeat, but rich with yearning. It's an allowance that however dark the day, the following may lighten."
A remix of the song by Beatnick and K-Salaam was included on the 2011 remix album "American Tragedy Redux".
Reception.
A reviewer for "SoCal Music Today" praised the song and said that it "tugs at the heart strings as the boys take a step back from aggression to let out some raw emotion". A reviewer for Sputnik Music called the track one of the best moments of the album and felt that the combination of "Coming Back Down" along with "Bullet" and "Levitate" on the album created a "three song knockout". The track was praised for incorporating "acoustic guitars and a chorus that wouldn’t sound out of place on an All Time Low album, with a love-lorn summery atmosphere that feels warm and comfortable for the band".
Some reviewers were critical, however. One review from Revolver Magazine called the ballad "the weaker in the record", despite having a positive review for the "American Tragedy" album as a whole.

Kleetope

In geometry and polyhedral combinatorics, the Kleetope of a polyhedron or higher-dimensional convex polytope is another polyhedron or polytope formed by replacing each facet of with a shallow pyramid. Kleetopes are named after Victor Klee.
Examples.
The triakis tetrahedron is the Kleetope of a tetrahedron, the triakis octahedron is the Kleetope of an octahedron, and the triakis icosahedron is the Kleetope of an icosahedron. In each of these cases the Kleetope is formed by adding a triangular pyramid to each face of the original polyhedron. Conway generalizes Kepler's "kis" prefix as this same kis operator.
The tetrakis hexahedron is the Kleetope of the cube, formed by adding a square pyramid to each of its faces, and the pentakis dodecahedron is the Kleetope of the dodecahedron, formed by adding a pentagonal pyramid to each face of the dodecahedron.
The base polyhedron of a Kleetope does not need to be a Platonic solid. For instance, the disdyakis dodecahedron is the Kleetope of the rhombic dodecahedron, formed by replacing each rhombus face of the dodecahedron by a rhombic pyramid, and the disdyakis triacontahedron is the Kleetope of the rhombic triacontahedron. In fact, the base polyhedron of a Kleetope does not need to be Face-transitive, as can be seen from the tripentakis icosidodecahedron above.
The Goldner–Harary graph may be represented as the graph of vertices and edges of the Kleetope of the triangular bipyramid.
Definitions.
One method of forming the Kleetope of a polytope is to place a new vertex outside , near the centroid of each facet. If all of these new vertices are placed close enough to the corresponding centroids, then the only other vertices visible to them will be the vertices of the facets from which they are defined. In this case, the Kleetope of is the convex hull of the union of the vertices of and the set of new vertices.
Alternatively, the Kleetope may be defined by duality and its dual operation, truncation: the Kleetope of is the dual polyhedron of the truncation of the dual of .
Properties and applications.
If has enough vertices relative to its dimension, then the Kleetope of is "dimensionally unambiguous": the graph formed by its edges and vertices is not the graph of a different polyhedron or polytope with a different dimension. More specifically, if the number of vertices of a -dimensional polytope is at least , then is dimensionally unambiguous.
If every -dimensional face of a -dimensional polytope is a simplex, and if , then every -dimensional face of is also a simplex. In particular, the Kleetope of any three-dimensional polyhedron is a simplicial polyhedron, a polyhedron in which all facets are triangles.
Kleetopes may be used to generate polyhedra that do not have any Hamiltonian cycles: any path through one of the vertices added in the Kleetope construction must go into and out of the vertex through its neighbors in the original polyhedron, and if there are more new vertices than original vertices then there are not enough neighbors to go around. In particular, the Goldner–Harary graph, the Kleetope of the triangular bipyramid, has six vertices added in the Kleetope construction and only five in the bipyramid from which it was formed, so it is non-Hamiltonian; it is the simplest possible non-Hamiltonian simplicial polyhedron. If a polyhedron with vertices is formed by repeating the Kleetope construction some number of times, starting from a tetrahedron, then its longest path has length ; that is, the shortness exponent of these graphs is , approximately 0.630930. The same technique shows that in any higher dimension , there exist simplicial polytopes with shortness exponent . Similarly, used the Kleetope construction to provide an infinite family of examples of simplicial polyhedra with an even number of vertices that have no perfect matching.
Kleetopes also have some extreme properties related to their vertex degrees: if each edge in a planar graph is incident to at least seven other edges, then there must exist a vertex of degree at most five all but one of whose neighbors have degree 20 or more, and the Kleetope of the Kleetope of the icosahedron provides an example in which the high-degree vertices have degree exactly 20.

Thomas Clarges

Sir Thomas Clarges (c 1618 – 4 October 1695) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1656 and 1695. He played an important part in bringing about the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660.
Origins.
Clarges was the son of John Clarges and his wife Anne Leaver. He was an apothecary in London. His sister Anne Clarges was the wife of the royalist General George Monck, later 1st Duke of Albemarle. 
Career.
In 1656 Clarges was elected Member of Parliament for the Sheriffdoms of Ross, Sutherland, and Cromarty in the Second Protectorate Parliament. In 1659 he was MP for the Boroughs of Banff and Cullen, and Aberdeen and for the Boroughs of Peebles, Selkirk, Jedburgh, Lauder, North Berwick, Dunbar and Haddington in the Third Protectorate Parliament. When Richard Cromwell became Lord Protector he ordered Clarges to go immediately to Scotland with his letters to George Monck, Clarge's brother-in-law, to obtain Monck's view of his protectorate. Clarges became Monck's main agent as he set about planning the Restoration of the Monarchy. 
In April 1660 Clarges was elected Member of Parliament for Westminster in the Convention Parliament. On 5 May Monck sent Clarges as an envoy to King Charles II at Breda carrying a letter from the general, in an answer to a letter from Charles, and the address of the officers of the army pledging support. Monck also wrote another short letter in his own hand informing Charles that ""he chose to send Mr. Clarges to him, because he was the only person to be trusted in the nearest concernments and consultations, for his restoration, as one, to whom he desired his majesty to give credit to what he should say on that behalf"". Clarges was well received and was knighted at Breda in May 1660.
In 1666 Clarges was elected MP Southwark in the Cavalier Parliament and sat until 1679. He was elected MP for Christchurch in 1679 and sat until 1685. He was elected MP for Oxford University in 1689 and sat until his death in 1695. 
Death.
Clarges died at his house in Piccadilly, Mayfair, in London. His properties in Mayfair are commemorated in the name of Clarges Street, which is near Albemarle Street named after the site of the residence of his nephew Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle.
Marriage & progeny.
Clarges married Mary Proctor, daughter of George Proctor of Norwell Woodhouse in Nottinghamshire. They had a son Sir Walter Clarges, 1st Baronet.

Caroline Smith and the Good Night Sleeps

Caroline Smith and the Good Night Sleeps is an indie folk band from Minneapolis, Minnesota fronted by singer and primary songwriter Caroline Smith.
History.
Caroline Smith is originally from Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, a town of about 8,600 according to the 2010 Census. She began playing music at an early age, reportedly learning guitar from her father. At 16 she started performing publicly at Zorbaz Pizza in her hometown and opened for B.B. King as well as releasing a self-titled album. Caroline has been quoted saying she prefers the guitar, more than other instruments, because of her ability to control the dynamics. She describes her voice as a "conglomerate" with countless influences ranging from Billie Holiday to Peter, Paul and Mary among others.
In 2006, at 18 she moved to Minneapolis to study at the University of Minnesota. She quickly began a weekly solo gig at Minneapolis' West Bank 400 Bar, a venue famous for acts such as Elliott Smith, Conor Oberst and Mason Jennings. In 2007, the club's owner, Tom Sullivan, introduced her to drummer Arlen Peiffer who is known for his work in the band Cloud Cult. A year later, bassist Jesse Schuster joined the band. Then in March 2011, Caroline joined forces with multi-instrumentalist Alex Ramsey expanding into the Good Night Sleeps.
Career.
In August 2008, the band released their debut full length album "Backyard Tent Set". The album was recorded at Devil's Workshop in Minneapolis with Chad Weis (Mason Jennings, Ben Kweller). The sound is described by Smith as "storybook folk with an indie twist. We think it's important that our recording sounds like our live show." The band has toured twice in support of the album, playing as many dates as possible including an open mic at the Shadow Lounge in Pittsburgh. 
In 2010, Smith and bandmate Jesse Schuster released "Live at the Cedar", recorded exclusively during a show at the Cedar Cultural Center. The album included several songs from "Backyard Tentset" as well as five additions. The albums were hand packaged and fitted with an envelope, string and a wax stamp and sold out within 6 months.
The band has completed seven national tours, played at countless venues including Minneapolis' notable First Avenue. Smith described the experience of selling out the hometown venue: "When I was in high school, I used to sit in my bathroom and sing with my guitar and pretend I was on the main stage of First Avenue...I was totally transported back to that moment as soon as I started playing and I got all giddy." 
On March 6, 2011, Minnesota Public Radio station 89.3 The Current premiered a new song from the band on The Local Show entitled "Tank Top." Previously, Smith, along with bandmate Jesse Schuster, performed "She Ain't Got it," "Lack of Height," "Denim Boy" and "Tying My Shoes" in the 89.3 The Current studios which was filmed on February 2, 2010.
Most recently, Caroline Smith and company have completed tracking a new full length entitled "Little Wind" at the Terrarium in Minneapolis with Jason Orris (Polara, Happy Apple, Haley Bonar). The record, mixed by Tom Herbers (Low, Dark Dark Dark, Andrew Bird), was released on September 20, 2011. She describes the new record as an "evolving more rocking sound still with folk elements and roots, We like to say post folk." 
Caroline's newest abum "Half About Being A Woman," has a more neo-soul feel. She spoke about it saying, "I’m glad we gave ourselves a chance to write the music we really love." Smith's newest album draws influences from "the 90’s neo-soul explosion: Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, D’Angelo."

Li Kuangwei

Li Kuangwei (李匡威) (d. 893) was a warlord late in the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, who controlled Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) after inherited it from his father Li Quanzhong in 886, until he was overthrown by his brother Li Kuangchou in 893. After he was overthrown, he resided briefly at the domain of his ally Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). He subsequently tried to seize control of the circuit from Wang, but was killed by Chengde soldiers faithful to Wang.
Background.
It is not known when Li Kuangwei was born, but it is known that his family was from Lulong Circuit's capital Fanyang. The first historical reference to him was in 886, when his father, the military governor ("Jiedushi") Li Quanzhong, who had seized control of Lulong in 885 after overthrowing the prior military governor Li Keju, died, and Li Kuangwei thereafter claimed the title of acting military governor. At some point, the imperial government confirmed him as full military governor.
As military governor of Lulong.
It was said that Li Kuangwei was ambitious, and, because the Tang state was in disarray at the time, he strengthened his army with the intent of eventually trying to occupy more territory.
In 890, another major warlord, Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), attacked Helian Duo the defender of Yun Prefecture (雲州, in modern Datong, Shanxi), capturing its eastern part. Helian sought aid from Li Kuangwei, and Li Kuangwei took 30,000 men to aid him. After Li Keyong's officer An Jinjun (安金俊) died in battle and another officer, Shen Xin (申信), surrendered to Helian, Li Keyong was forced to withdraw.
As a result of Li Keyong's attack on Helian, Helian and Li Kuangwei submitted petitions to Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong, asking the emperor to declare a general campaign against Li Keyong. They were concurred in by Li Keyong's rival Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), as well as the chancellors Zhang Jun and Kong Wei. Emperor Zhaozong thus declared a general campaign against Li Keyong, with Zhang in command. As part of the operations against Li Keyong, Li Kuangwei and Helian were to attack Li Keyong from the north. They had initial successes, as Li Kuangwei captured Wei Prefecture, and Helian, along with Tufan and Xiajiasi tribesmen, attacked Zhelu Base (遮虜軍, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), killing its defender Liu Huzi (劉胡子). However, Li Keyong then sent a major force under his adoptive sons Li Cunxin and Li Siyuan, and they defeated Li Kuangwei and Helian, capturing Li Kuangwei's son Li Renzong (李仁宗) and Helian's son-in-law, forcing them to withdraw. Zhang's main operations against Li Keyong subsequently collapsed under pressure from Li Keyong. Faced with defeat, Emperor Zhaozong was forced to restore all of Li Keyong's titles.
In fall 891, Li Keyong attacked Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit and had initial successes. When Li Kuangwei led an army to aid Wang, Li Keyong, after pillaging Chengde territory, withdrew. In spring 892, Li Kuangwei and Wang jointly attacked the Hedong-held town of Yaoshan (堯山, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), but were defeated by Li Keyong's officer Li Sixun (李嗣勳) and thereafter withdrew. Thereafter, Li Keyong and his ally Wang Chucun the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei); they withdrew after Li Kuangwei attacked Yun and Dai (代州, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi) Prefectures (which had fallen to Hedong control by that point, forcing Helian to flee to Lulong). Late in 892, Li Kuangwei and Helian launched another attack on Yun, hoping to recapture it for Helian, but Li Keyong defeated them and forced them to withdraw.
Overthrow and death.
In 893, Li Keyong attacked Wang Rong again, and Wang could not repel his attack despite aid from Li Cunxiao, formerly an adoptive son of Li Keyong's who had turned against Li Keyong. Li Kuangwei launched his army to aid Wang, and after he defeated Li Keyong, Li Keyong withdrew. Because of this, Wang awarded Li Keyong's army with a large amount of money and silk.
However, right as he launched his army, Li Kuangwei had sown the seeds of his defeat. His family members had held a feast to send him off, and at the feast, Li Kuangwei, who was drunk, raped the beautiful wife of his younger brother Li Kuangchou. Thereafter, while Li Kuangwei was on the way back to Lulong after aiding Wang, Li Kuangchou took over the Lulong headquarters and claimed the title of acting military governor, and subsequently issued orders to the Lulong soldiers to return to Lulong. The Lulong soldiers largely followed that order and deserted Li Kuangwei, who was left at Chengde's Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) with a small number of his close followers. Unsure what he should do next, he sent his assistant Li Baozhen (李抱真) to the imperial capital Chang'an, requesting that he be allowed to report to the imperial capital. However, thereafter, as Wang was grateful to Li Kuangwei for his aid and sorry that Li Kuangwei had lost his own circuit, welcomed Li Kuangwei to Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture (鎮州). He built a mansion for Li Kuangwei and honored Li Kuangwei like a father.
Once Li Kuangwei settled in at Zhen, he assisted Wang in building the defenses of Zhen Prefecture and training Chengde soldiers. However, as Wang was young (19) at the time, and Li Kuangwei himself liked the customs of the people of Zhen, he plotted with Li Baozhen (who had returned from Chang'an by that point) to seize control of the circuit. Later in 893, on the anniversary of the death of one of Li Kuangwei's parents, when Wang was at Li Kuangwei's mansion to pay his respects, Li Kuangwei had his own soldiers try to seize Wang. Wang, reacting quickly, stated that he was willing to turn the control of the circuit to him but that they should formally do so at the circuit headquarters. Li Kuangwei agreed, and they rode horses together toward headquarters, escorted by Li Kuangwei's soldiers. On the way there, one of the Chengde soldiers, Mo Junhe (墨君和), hidden in a corner, seized Wang and took him out of Li Kuangwei's corps of soldiers. The remaining Chengde troops, once they saw that Wang was out of danger, attacked Li Kuangwei and his troops, slaughtering them and allowing Wang to retain Chengde.

Members of the community are informed that the cameras are present to film a documentary. The U.S. version was much like the British and featured each week wealthy benefactors entering deprived neighbourhoods of the United States incognito.They spend a week mingling within the community and live on a very low-cost budget. At the end of the show, the millionaires reveal their identities and proceed to donate at least $100,000 to the members of the community.

Medical kiosk

Medical kiosks are computerized, electronic kiosks. Some function as patient check-in stations at hospitals or doctors' offices. Other, more advanced kiosks can perform basic diagnostic tests on patients. Most medical kiosks have touchscreens and can be classified as interactive kiosks.
Check-in Kiosks.
MEDHOST, HealthAsyst, MedServ, eVaidya.com and Vecna Technologies have all developed patient self-check-in kiosks. These just replace the clerks in the front desk.
Diagnostic Kiosks.
Diagnostic kiosks can be used to address shortages of physicians in rural areas throughout the world.
Manned vs Unmanned.
Manned.
Manned kiosks, such as Cisco's HealthPresence, can do more tests than unmanned ones. Their disadvantage is that an RN (registered nurse) has to be on site.
Unmanned.
Unmanned kiosks, such as the Freescale Flexus-MM kiosks, require only monthly maintenance. Although tests can still be done (blood pressure, spirometry, heart rate and ECG, blood glucose, and height/weight/BMI), there is not much variety.

Through NPO Avani Giving, Madhavi provides business mentorship and financial assistance to four groups in India and one group in South Africa.
Madhavi maintains strong connections with India, and spends some of her time living there and participating in charitable work. She is a patron of the Anbagam charity which pays for higher education of orphans supported by the Anbagam Orphanage near Trichy (India).
Controversy.
On September 6, 2013, United States District Court Western District of Washington at Seattle entered a judgment against Prithvi Solutions Inc. ordering them to pay over $17 million to Kyko Global Inc. in a lawsuit filed by the latter. To recover the penalty, Madhavi Vuppalapati received court’s notice for sale of personal property on February 12, 2014.

Smart Flesh

Smart Flesh is the fourth studio album by American indie folk band The Low Anthem, released on February 22, 2011 on Bella Union. The majority of the album was recorded in an abandoned pasta sauce factory in Central Falls, Rhode Island, near the band's hometown of Providence, Rhode Island. "Smart Flesh" is the only album to feature multi-instrumentalist Mat Davidson, who left the band during the album's promotional tour.
A numbered, letterpress printed version of the album was issued upon release, containing an additional disc with three "passable strays that missed the cut." The bonus track, "Dreams Can Chase You Down", is written by former member Dan Lefkowitz.
Background and recording.
After extensive touring in support of the band's previous album, "Oh My God, Charlie Darwin", the band set-up a recording studio in an abandoned pasta sauce factory, in their hometown, Providence, Rhode Island. Jeff Prystowsky states that the band "set out to make a record in a natural space, [...] a building that has its own kind of reverb, its own sound, a unique sound that we find beautiful."
The band stayed in the factory together for three months, with Prystowsky stating that "it wasn’t cushy at all." Ben Knox Miller noted that: "Obviously, there were personal tensions, you know? When you do anything intensely over a long period of time... it was like 3 months we were living in that place. This little place, as a family unit, whatever you want to call it. But yeah, we didn't picture that it would be that cold."
The environment of the factory ultimately dictated the album's overall aesthetic, with the band using different metals, woods and artifacts as percussive instruments. Prystowsky also notes that the album's emphasis on quieter songs is as a result of the recording space: "It just sounded muddy when you tried to play rowdy songs. It’s not an acoustically treated room, and you get a lot of drums and electric guitar, [then everything is muddy and you can’t hear the divisions, the timbres of the instruments. It had that kind of effect with some of those kinds of songs when we tried to play them in the factory building." Prior to the album's release, Miller remarked that "a lot of songs died in that space that would have flourished elsewhere, for musical reasons more so than lyrical reasons."
According to Miller and Prystowsky, the band recorded around thirty songs in the factory. The unreleased tracks are currently being considered for release under an "alter-ego" band, Snake Wagon. 
Following the recording sessions, the band travelled to Omaha to mix the tracks with Mike Mogis, of Bright Eyes fame. Miller described the man as "a genius. He’s like the man with the Midas touch."
The band subsequently returned to the pasta sauce factory for the album's launch gig, in March 2011.

Daniel Watson

Daniel Watson (c 1617 - June 1683) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1659 and 1660. He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War.
Watson was the son of Henry Watson, a tanner of Burton-upon-Trent and his wife Anne. He became a lawyer. In the civil war he became one of the most prominent Burton parliamentarians. He was a captain of dragoons in the Derbyshire cavalry. He was living in Burton in 1649, when he was appointed a J.P. for the county, and he acquired Nether Hall where he was probably living by at least 1656.
In 1659, Watson was elected Member of Parliament for Lichfield in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He sat in the corporation interest.

Lloyd's Patriotic Fund

The contributors created the fund to give grants to those wounded in service to the Crown and to set up annuities to the dependents of those killed in action. The Fund also awarded prizes to those British combatants who went beyond the call of duty. The rewards could be a sum of money, a sword or a piece of plate. The awards were highly publicized to help raise morale during wartime. In 1807 the fund also donated £61,000 to the Royal Naval Asylum, giving Lloyd's Patriotic Fund the enduring right to nominate children to the school.
On 24 August 1809 the Fund held a general meeting of its subscribers. The subscribers decided at that time to discontinue awards for merit. The Peninsular War was putting such demands on the Fund that it was felt that priority would have to go to support for the wounded and the dependents of those killed. Still, when the Fund awarded officers money for wounds received, some officers asked that the Fund give them an inscribed sword instead.
Swords.
The Fund issued 15 swords worth 30 pounds each, to midshipmen, masters' mates and Royal Marine lieutenants. Also, 91 swords worth 50 pounds each went to naval lieutenants and Royal Marine captains. It issued 35 swords worth 100 pounds each to commanders and naval captains. In addition, it issued 23 swords worth 100 pounds each to 23 naval captains who fought at Trafalgar. In addition, some 60 officers requested a piece of plate of equal value instead of a sword. Lastly, a number of officers opted for cash instead, either for themselves or to distribute to their crew.
One engagement might result in multiple awards. When a cutting-out party from HMS "Franchise" captured the "Raposa" in 1806, naval lieutenants John Fleming and Peter Douglas, and Lieutenant of Marines Mend, each received a sword worth 50 pounds, while Midshipman Lamb received one worth 30 pounds.
Not all the officers who received swords or other merit awards were naval officers or Royal Marines. Some were captains of privateers or East Indiamen. The Fund awarded Mr. Thomas Musgrave, captain of the private man of war "Kitty" an honour sabre worth 30 pounds for the action in which "Kitty" captured the Spanish ship "Felicity" (or "Felicidad"). After the Battle of Pulo Aura, Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave each captain a sword worth 50 pounds, and one to Lieutenant Robert Merrick Fowler (RN), who had distinguished himself in a variety of capacities during the engagement, and one worth 100 pounds to Captain Nathaniel Dance, who had been the commodore of the fleet.

Packing for Mars

Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void is a non-fiction work by science author Mary Roach.
Published in August 2010, "Packing for Mars" was recognized in "Amazon's Best Books" of that month, it quickly became a #6 "New York Times" bestseller, and it was chosen as the book of the year for the 7th annual One City One Book: San Francisco Reads literary event program.
In "Packing for Mars", Roach searches for answers to questions about the gross, the bizarre, and the uncomfortable aspects of space travel. The book's 16 chapters cover the entire comedic spectrum of all things space-related, and also include some study of the scientific side of space travel. The chapters discussing the various bodily functions of astronauts in space (going to the bathroom, having sex, vomiting) and obscure testing procedures (animals in space, lying in beds for months, parabolic zero-g) are balanced by the informative sections on topics such as the psychological effects of being in space, astronaut training, and the increasing use of human cadavers over crash test dummies in research.
Mary Roach's overview.
Mary Roach, the author of Packing for Mars, was raised in Etna, New Hampshire and spent several years working as a freelance copy editor and investigating unpopular topics. Roach explores lots of questions such as what happens after we die, what sex is all about, and what secrets human cadavers hold. However, in Packing for Mars, she turns her mind toward space and examines the logistics of space travel. In an interview, she describes her book to be about all the surreal physical and physiological challenges of living in space as a human being. Roach explains that in addition to these problems, human beings are not in the slightest equipped or prepared to confront these challenges. Although most of her other books have one-word titles, Mary Roach claims that it was especially difficult to come up with a one-word title for this specific book.
Topics covered.
The book covers 12 topics:

James Stanley Hey

James Stanley Hey FRS (3 May 1909 - 27 February 2000) was an English physicist and radio astronomer. With the targeted application of radar technology for astronomical research, he lay the basis for the development of radio astronomy . He discovered that the Sun radiates radio waves and localized for the first time an extragalactic radio source in the constellation Cygnus .
Biography.
He was born in 1909 in Nelson, Lancashire, the third son of a cotton manufacturer, which was the main industry in Lancashire. Hey studied physics at the University of Manchester, graduating in 1930, and obtained his master’s degree in X-ray crystallography the next year. His wife, Edna Heywood, was a fellow student there. He was then a teacher of physics in a northern grammar school for some years. In 1942 Hey joined the Army Operational Research Group (AORG) after a 6-week course at the Army Radio School. His task was to work on radar anti-jamming methods; for a year German jamming of Allied radar had been a problem and the escape of two German warships (Scharnhorst and Gneisenau) through the English Channel, aided by enemy radar jamming from the French Coast, had highlighted the problem. In February 1942 Hey had reports of severe noise jamming of anti-aircraft radars in the 4–8 m range. Realizing that the direction of maximum interference seemed to follow the Sun, he checked with the Royal Observatory and found that a very active sunspot was traversing the solar disc. He concluded that a sunspot region, which was believed to emit streams of energetic ions and electrons in magnetic fields of around 100 G (gauss), could emit metre-wave radiation. In 1942, G.C. Southworth in the USA also linked the Sun with radio noise, this time in the centimetre-wave region.
Later, in 1945, Hey used radar to track the paths of V-2 rockets approaching London at about 100 miles high. A problem here arose from spasmodic transient radar echoes at heights of about 60 miles, arriving at a rate of five to 10 per hour. When the V-2 attacks ceased, the echoes did not; Hey concluded that meteor trails were responsible and that radar could be used to track meteor streams, and could of course do so by day as well as by night.
Hey’s results of 1942 could not be published until after the war.
Hey became Head of the AORG in 1949. He then worked as a researcher at the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern, where he also continued his radio astronomical observations. From 1966 until his retirement in 1969 he was head of the research department.

T. Lawrence Dale

Thomas Lawrence Dale, FRIBA, FSA (known as T.L. Dale, T. Lawrence Dale or Lawrence Dale) was an English architect. Until the First World War he concentrated on designing houses for private clients. From the 1930s Dale was the Oxford Diocesan Surveyor and was most noted for designing, restoring, and furnishing Church of England parish churches.
Training and career.
Dale was born in London, where he was educated at University College School in Hampstead. He began his architectural training at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in 1900, was articled to Charles Ponting in Marlborough, Wiltshire 1901–04, and served as assistant to the architect Edmund Buckle 1904–06. Dale passed his architect's qualifying examination in 1906 and was admitted as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA) in 1907.
Before the First World War, Dale lived in Bedford Park in west London. By the outbreak of that war he had his own practice at 40 Great James Street, off Bedford Row, London WC1. In the war he was commissioned as an officer in an infantry battalion, but when he was placed in reserve he successfully applied to transfer to the Army Cyclist Corps in order to see active service. He rose to the rank of Captain and was mentioned in despatches.
After the war, Dale moved to Banbury where designed a housing estate for Banbury Rural District Council. In the 1920s Dale spent ""a delightful year"" working on ""an exceedingly complicated planning problem"" as a competitor in a worldwide architectural competition to design the new Freemasons' Grand Temple in Great Queen Street in London. Dale came second, for which he won ""a large prize"".
Some time thereafter he moved to Oxford, where he designed the modest neo-Georgian house that was built for him and his family at 358 Woodstock Road. He later moved again to 4 Bradmore Road on the Victorian Norham Manor estate.
Dale served as Oxford Diocesan Surveyor for 23 years. He designed at least four parish churches that were built in or near Oxford. He also designed restoration work or new furnishings for a number of parish churches; most of them in Oxfordshire, plus one in Warwickshire.
Family.
Dale's wife predeceased him. They left two sons and two daughters. By the time of Dale's death, both sons had married and one of the daughters was a Sister in a religious order.
Dale's death in 1959 was reported in "The Times". Harry Carpenter, Bishop of Oxford, assisted at his funeral.
Dale's elder son Thomas Simon Savage Dale (known as Simon Dale) was born in 1919 and also became an architect. They practised together as Dale and Son. In 1957 Simon Dale married Susan Wilberforce, a descendant of William Wilberforce, and moved with her to Hopton Castle, Shropshire. Lawrence Dale died in 1959 and is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery near his home in Oxford. Simon Dale later lost his sight, was divorced in 1972, and in 1987 was beaten to death at The Heath, the house that he and Susan had restored at Hopton Castle.
Secular buildings.
Two of Dale's earlier works are Edwardian houses in Hampstead Garden Suburb, one of which has been described as ""an excellent house of the Lutyens school"". Horn Park, a country house about north-west of Beaminster, Dorset, is Dale's largest and perhaps most significant house design. It is a symmetrical neo-Georgian building of five bays and two storeys, completed in 1911. Its central corridor is barrel vaulted and leads to a drawing room whose groin vault is reminiscent of the work of Sir John Soane (1753–1837). The house is Listed Grade II.
Lawrence and Simon Dale together designed Ickford Village Hall (1946). The roof and almost all of the walls are hung with wooden shingles, possibly in response to the shortage of many types of building material after the Second World War.
Parish churches.
Like Charles Ponting (1850–1932) to whom he had been articled, Dale's ecclesiastical architecture was strongly Anglo-Catholic. However, whereas Ponting continued to work in the Gothic Revival idiom long after it had passed out of fashion, Dale adopted Italianate architecture for his churches.
Dale designed at least four parish churches for the Diocese of Oxford. The first, St. Francis of Assisi, Cowley (1930–31), was built on a site provided by Morris Motors as a temporary daughter church of St. James, Cowley. It was made a permanent church and dedicated in 1962. St. Francis' is a simple building with only a small chancel. Dale's second church, St. Alban the Martyr, Oxford (1933), replaced a chapel of ease that had been built for St. Mary and St. John parish church in 1889. St. Alban's is a relatively low building for its length and is limited by a narrow corner site. He also designed ""halls"" – possibly mission halls – for the parishes of St. Nicholas, Marston and St. James, Cowley.
Dale's churches built after the Second World War were more ambitious. St. Michael and All Angels, New Marston (1954–56), was built as a chapel of ease for St. Andrew's parish church, Headington. It is more substantial in scale and has a statue of St. Michael by Michael Groser and a reredos painted by Leon Underwood. St. Michael's is described as being in a ""vaguely Italian renaissance style"" but the building is slightly limited by its corner site. Dale's final church, St. Swithun, Kennington (1956–58), is in a spacious churchyard that allowed Dale the space to use a more spacious cruciform plan.
Most of Dale's churches share common features: a tympanum with bas-reliefs over the main door, pantiled roofs, an Italianate pent-roofed chimney for the boiler and in some cases a baldachin over the main altar and a pantiled bell-cot on the west gable. With the exception of St. Francis of Assisi (which is stuccoed) they are built of a modern buff brick that contrasts with traditional building materials in this part of England. The tympanum at St. Alban the Martyr was carved by John Brookes, then Principal of Oxford City Technical College. St. Francis' has also a set of Stations of the Cross carved by Eric Gill.
Watercolours.
Dale was a watercolourist ""of more than average ability"" who was a member of local arts clubs in Oxford. He held a number of exhibitions of his work, which was compared with that of Paul Sandby.
"Christ Church Mall".
Central Oxford had become acutely congested with motor traffic in the 1920s and 1930s. When Dale first moved from Banbury to Oxford he practised from an office in Carfax ""but the traffic there was shocking"" so he gave up his office and practised from home.
In September 1941 Dale published a six-page pamphlet called "Christ Church Mall: a Diversion" in which he proposed a relief road skirting the south side of Christ Church Meadow along the bank of the River Thames to link Abingdon Road and Iffley Road to bypass High Street.
In 1944 Dale expanded on his proposals into a 60-page book, "Towards a Plan for Oxford City", illustrated with some of his own watercolours. In it he reiterated his "Christ Church Mall" road proposal and proposed extensive redevelopment of St. Clement's and St. Ebbes.
In 1946 the County Borough of Oxford commissioned Thomas Sharp to make proposals to relieve Oxford's traffic and re-plan parts of the city. In 1948 Sharp published his report as a book, "Oxford Replanned", in which he paid tribute:
"Mr. Dale has presented his case very attractively and wittily, and has done the city a considerable service in braving the controversy which was bound to result from any attempt to touch even the hem of the sacred Christ Church Meadow."
However, Sharp also thought that Dale's "Christ Church Mall" would be too indirect, particularly for traffic from Headington Hill and Marston Road. Sharp instead proposed a road across the northern side of Christ Church Meadow, which he called "Merton Mall" as it would have passed very close to Merton College.
"The Times" also commended Dale for ""presenting his case with architectural vision, wit and eloquence"" in "Towards a Plan for Oxford City", and quoted Dale's vision that ""a finely designed parkway"" would be ""A beautiful road between the Towers and the Thames severally dreaming and streaming"".
In 1956 the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation held an enquiry at which Dale continued to make his case. Dale told the enquiry:
"nobody more than he admired the beauty of Christ Church Meadow, and anyone who wanted a road through it was a vandal. But, he said, there was a vast difference in having a road round the Meadow, as he was suggesting. The road could be so landscaped that it could not be seen from the river or from the north side of the meadow. The real beauty of the meadow was Merton Fields and the Broad Walk, and that would be destroyed by Dr. Sharp's plan."
Dale cited in his support Professor Sir Albert Richardson, then president of the Royal Academy, who ""had said, in 1944, that Christ Church Meadow would suffer no detriment if skirted by a tree-lined road"".
Sharp's proposal was the subject of more than 20 years of political and public debate and protest. Neither Sharp's nor Dale's proposed road was ever built.

Montes Universales

Montes Universales is a long mountain range in the southwestern end of the Iberian System. Its highest point is the 1,935 m high summit known as Caimodorro. The 1,830 m high Muela de San Juan is another important peak. 
Administratively the Montes Universales belong to the Sierra de Albarracín comarca of Aragon, therefore there are often confused with the geographical Sierra de Albarracín mountain range. 
Geography.
The range is aligned in a NW - SE direction and is not as high as neighboring mountain ranges. It is, however, very significant from the hydrographic point of view for important rivers of the Iberian Peninsula have their source in these mountains, which divide the Atlantic from the Mediterranean watershed. Among the Iberian rivers that originate in the Montes Universales the most important are Tagus on the western slopes, and the Túria, Cabriel and Xúquer on the eastern.
The Montes Universales limit on the northeast with the paleozoic massifs of Caimodorro and Loma Alta, in the southeast with the Serranía de Cuenca and with the Sierra de Jabalón and the Túria Valley in the east.
Flora and fauna.
These mountains are covered with mostly not very dense clumps of pine, oak and Iberian Juniper "(Juniperus thurifera)" forest. 
Radiocarbon samples from Ojos del Tremedal show that birches, now almost absent from these mountains, were very common in the Montes Universales during the ice age around 9,600 years ago. Signs of human interference with the vegetation have been detected beginning from about 3,500 years before.
"Erebia zapateri" is an endemic butterfly of these mountains.

Bernt Heiberg

Johan Bernt Krohg Heiberg (4 September 1909 – 29 September 2001) was a Norwegian architect.
Early and personal life.
He was born in Kristiania to the barrister Axel Heiberg (1875–1952) and his wife Ragnhild Krohg (1879–1947). He had two brothers: Axel Heiberg jr. (1908–88) and Edvard Heiberg (1911–2000). In 1935, Heiberg married Halldis Rollang (1910–92).
Career.
Heiberg took examen artium in 1927. He thereafter moved to Trondheim, where he studied at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. In 1936, he was hired as an assistant by Frithjof Stoud Platou. Four years later, he started his own architectural firm in Oslo. In the 1950s, Heiberg designed many buildings for the housing cooperative Oslo Bolig- og Sparelag and Christiania Bank. He designed also many buildings with Ola Mørk Sandvik until 1968, among them the head office of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the restaurant "Annen Etage" and the Hotel Continental.
Heiberg's buildings were mostly designed in functionalist style, which he considered "architecture for living people". When it came to politics, Heiberg was a leftist. However, despite his being a supporter of the communist league "Mot Dag" in the 1930s, Heiberg opposed the May 1968 revolts, stating that he "with shame had to admit, that was tired of the whole thing".
From 1961 to 1971, Heiberg headed the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. He also headed the board of the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design from 1978 to 1981. In 1950, he was decorated as a Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav. He died on 29 September 2001.

Phillip Scott Burge. 1895 - 1918, was a First World War fighter pilot and flying ace. He was killed in action over France in 1918 after earning the Military Cross.
Early life.
Burge was a student at Marlborough College before World War I. He joined the British Army early in the First World War, and won the Military Medal during Summer 1916 while serving in the ranks. He transferred into, and was commissioned in, the Royal Flying Corps in 1917.
World War I.
Burge was appointed as a Flying Officer while a temporary second lieutenant on probation on 24 May 1917. He was assigned to 64 Squadron as a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a pilot. He scored his first aerial victory on 23 March 1918, when he destroyed a Fokker Dr.I triplane fighter over Bourlon Wood. One week later, he and James Anderson Slater shared in the destruction of a German two-seater reconnaissance airplane over Croisilles, France. On 1 April, he destroyed an Albatros D.V fighter over Méricourt. Promotion from lieutenant to temporary captain while on flight status came on 20 April 1918.
On 3 May 1918, Burge shared in the destruction of a Rumpler recon plane over Mercatel. On 16 May, he scored twice in the same dogfight, destroying an Albatros D.V and driving another down out of control. On consecutive days, 20 and 21 May, he destroyed Halberstadt reconnaissance machines for victories seven and eight.
He would not score again until 19 July 1918, when he destroyed another Fokker triplane south of Lille. The next day, he, Edmund Tempest, and another pilot cooperated to ruin a Rumpler over Drocourt. On 22 July 1918, he won for the last time, destroying an Albatros D.V over Harnes. His final tally was six enemy airplanes destroyed solo, three more shared destructions, and two enemy fighter sent down out of control.
On 24 July 1918, Phillip Scott Burge was killed in action when his plane was set afire in midair. His conqueror is generally conceded to be "Unteroffizier" Marat Schumm of Jasta 52. Burge was interred in Dud Corner Cemetery in Loos, Pas-de-Calais, France.
On 16 September 1918, Burge's award of the Military Cross was gazetted. It read:
"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. This officer is a brilliant fighting pilot, and has destroyed six enemy aeroplanes. His dash and determination when engaged in combat with the enemy, often numerically superior, have set a fine example to the remainder of his formation."

Sidney Jeffryes

Sidney Jeffryes (born c. 1885), was an Australian spark-gap radio operator. He is best known for his service as the wireless officer at Cape Denison during the second year (February 1913 − December 1913) of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition under the command of explorer Douglas Mawson. His service ended in September 1913, two months prior to the relief of the shore party, when Jeffryes developed symptoms of paranoia and had to be relieved of his duties.
Biography.
Jeffryes, from Toowoomba, Queensland, had qualified as a wireless operator with the Australasian Wireless Company and was in his late 20's when an appeal was made for a wireless operator to serve during the second winter of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE). A series of tragedies and mishaps had led to the Cape Denison shore base on Antarctica being kept open for a second winter, March–December 1913. As the radioman who had served in 1912−1913 was returning home, the expedition needed a new specialist.
The AAE expedition was the first Antarctic expedition in history, and the only one during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, to maintain radio contact with its country of origin. The equipment available in 1912 and 1913 did not allow the Cape Denison base to transmit directly to Tasmania. The expedition had also organized a second winter-over base, at Macquarie Island, which served as a radio relay station. By means of a two-step process, messages in Morse code were transmitted back and forth between Australia and the Antarctic coast.
In Antarctica.
Jeffryes arrived at the Cape Denison shore base in February 1913 as the base was enduring a near-nightmare situation. The expedition's leader and commander, Douglas Mawson, stumbled into the base, the sole survivor of a sled dog probe eastward along the previously unknown interior coastline of the Australian Antarctic Territory. As the new wireless operator, Jeffryes was able to start the relay of communications that would inform Australia of the expedition leader's survival. However, within days of Mawson's arrival, the Antarctic winter began.
Mawson's expedition hut was located close to what was then the location of the South Magnetic Pole, and continued radio interference and static associated with polar conditions threatened the base's minimal ability to contact Macquarie Island. The expedition leader at first admired Jeffryes's assiduity with earphones and Morse-code key, but grew increasingly guarded in his praise. In Mawson's words, Jeffryes "applied himself to work with enthusiasm and perhaps an over-conscientious spirit." Climate conditions outside the hut made winter outdoor exercise impossible, leading to cabin fever. 
In July 1913, as Antarctica neared midwinter, wireless operator Jeffryes began to present symptoms of paranoia to his fellow shore-party winter explorers, none of whom knew how to receive or transmit messages in Morse code. Expedition leader Mawson began to encourage another expedition member, airman Frank Bickerton, to learn Morse code as quickly as possible. Jeffryes's condition waxed and waned; for some weeks his comrades believed he was recovering, but in September of the same year the radioman experienced a psychotic break and began transmitting a message, through Macquarie Island, to Australia. Declaring himself to be the only sane man on the expedition, Jeffryes accused all of his comrades of having joined a criminal conspiracy to murder him. Mawson thereupon relieved Jeffryes of his duties.
Return home.
In December 1913, the expedition's sea vessel "Aurora" relieved the troubled Antarctic shore party. Upon Jeffryes's return to Australia, his paranoia was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia and he was confined to a mental health center in Ararat, Victoria. Little is known of his later life.
The expedition's head and designated spokesman, Douglas Mawson, had little to say in his published histories about Jeffryes' active service in Antarctica. For almost 100 years, the unfortunate wireless operator's name was suppressed from most Antarctic records. In August 2010, the Australian Antarctic Division honored Jeffryes for his pioneering winter service by naming a previously unnamed glacier after him. The "Jeffryes Glacier" is located at 67°4' South, 143°59' East, in the Australian Antarctic Territory. It should not be confused with the Jeffries Glacier.
In December 2013, the first opera to be based on Mawson's 1911–14 expedition to Antarctica, "The Call of Aurora" (by Tasmanian composer Joe Bugden) was performed at The Peacock Theatre in Hobart. "The Call of Aurora" investigates the relationship between Douglas Mawson and his wireless operator, Sidney Jeffryes.

Great Wall Haval H5

The Great Wall Haval H5, also known as Hover H5, is a compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced by the Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motors since 2009. The vehicle, sometimes referred to by its export market name X240, is available with both 4×2 and 4x4 drivetrains, and either gasoline and diesel engines. The vehicle has passed the European tests regarding environment protection, safety and performance and is entitled for marketing throughout the European Union. It is the successor of the Great Wall Haval H3 and both cars are nearly identical, except for their front designs.
Features.
The H5 uses Mitsubishi 4G63 and Mitsubishi 4G69S4N petrol engines of 2.0 and 2.4 litres, or the GW2.5TCI Diesel. In October 2010, the more powerful but smaller (2.0 litres) GW4D20 Diesel was added to the lineup. The Haval H5 comes with either a five-speed or a six-speed manual transmission, depending on model. It uses disk brakes. It has three trims: Standard, Luxury and Premium. The Premium trim features power windows, power door locks, rear window defrosters, leather seats, power adjustable seats (driver only), six speakers, a DVD player, GPS and a power sunroof all as standard. Heated seats are optional. 
Great Wall also plans to bring the H5 to the American market. It is also sold locally in China.
Starting from 2011, the variant sold in Australia will no longer be the H3, but the face-lifted H5, although the 2.4 litre gasoline model is sold as the X240 and is only available in manual transmission, and the 2.0 litre diesel models are available in either automatic or manual transmission and are sold as the X200.
Variations.
A slightly different version, with a typical large grille and called the GKC Edition was also produced, but only for the Chinese market. This version was facelifted in July 2011 and was known as the Zhizun.

Stafford L. Warren

Stafford Leak Warren (July 19, 1896 - July 26, 1981) was an American physician and radiologist who was a pioneer in the field of nuclear medicine and best known for his invention of the mammogram. Warren developed the technique of producing stereoscopic images of the breast with X-rays while working in the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.
Warren was commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District. He was responsible for the health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity nuclear test in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear test at Bikini Atoll.
In 1947 Warren became the first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine.
Early life.
Stafford Leak Warren was born in Maxwell, New Mexico on June 19, 1896. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. He married Viola Lockhart on May 22, 1920. Their marriage produced two sons and a daughter. He went to medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, graduating with his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1922. He then did post-doctoral work at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Harvard University.
University of Rochester.
Warren joined the faculty of the Department of Radiology at the University of Rochester School of Medicine in 1926, becoming an Assistant Professor of Medicine. The department was a new one that had only been founded in 1921, based upon the ideals of medical education propounded by Abraham Flexner in his 1910 Flexner Report. The medical school had opened in 1925 and did not graduate its first class until 1929. Warren was one of the original group that Dean George Whipple assembled to staff the new medical school. At Rochester, Warren investigated the effects of artificial fever, including its possible use for treating gonococci infections. He was also interested in radiography.
In 1930, Warren became an Associate Professor of Medicine. That year he published "A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast". X-ray imaging of the breast had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 mastectomy specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer. He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst. However, Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations. Warren used radiology to track changes in breast tissue as a result of pregnancy and mastitis. He developed a stereoscopic technique, using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose X-ray equipment to his needs. His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being X-rayed. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. This represented a leap forward, as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery. It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world. Today mammography saves thousands of lives.
Manhattan Project.
In February 1943, Warren met with Dr Albert K. Chapman, the Vice President and General Manager of Eastman Kodak, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project and Colonel James C. Marshall, the commander of the Manhattan Engineer District (MED). They asked him about his work with radiation and isotopes and asked Warren to become a civilian consultant for the MED. In March 1943, Warren met with Major Hymer L. Friedell at the MED's New York City headquarters. Friedell had joined the Metallurgical Laboratory in August 1942 from the University of California, Berkeley, where he had been involved in radiology research under Dr Robert S. Stone. Friedell requested information about safety matters involving radiation. Warren was unable to provide all the information, but agreed to initiate research at Rochester.
Friedell recommended that in view of the scope of the Manhattan Project, a more senior officer be placed in charge. In October, Groves penned a letter to the Surgeon General of the United States Army, Major General Norman T. Kirk, requesting that he cooperate with the Manhattan Project in furnishing medical supplies, providing funds for medical care of military personnel, and directly commissioning Warren and other doctors at specified ranks. This letter was signed by Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell and delivered in person by Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols, who had replaced Marshall as the district engineer. Kirk was furious at what he saw as usurpation of his statutory responsibilities as Surgeon General. When told that Warren was the man the district had in mind to commission as a colonel, and apparently familiar with Warren's work only from his use of radiation to treat venereal disease asked "Why do you want that clap doctor?"
Warren was duly commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army Medical Corps on November 3, 1943. He was appointed as chief of the MED's medical section and medical advisor to the director of the Manhattan Project, with Friedell as his deputy. Warren's office was initially located in New York City but moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee soon after. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland, Washington and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Warren's section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages used in novel ways, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Yet in December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below that of private industry.
Warren was personally responsible for the safety aspects of the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July 1945 at Alamogordo, New Mexico. There was considerable concern about radioactive fallout and a network of geiger counters was established to track the fallout cloud. Groves found Warren at the base camp shortly after the explosion and was displeased to discover that Warren had been awake for the previous 48 hours. Groves had US Navy Captain George Lyons take over so Warren could get some rest. Fortunately, no problems arose with the test.
The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were carried out on 6 and 9 August 1945. On 11 August, Groves phoned Warren and ordered him to organize a survey team and proceed to Guam, and thence to Japan to evaluate the effect of the atomic bombs and take measures to insure the safety of Allied troops occupying the cities. Initially the survey team was to accompany the assault troops of the III Amphibious Corps and the V Amphibious Corps in the invasion of Japan, but Japan surrendered on 14 August, the day the survey team departed San Francisco by air. The survey team arrived on Tinian on 17 August, where it was split into two parties, one under Warren and the other under Friedell. Warren's party, equipped with portable geiger counters, arrived in Hiroshima by air on 8 September as part of a group headed by Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell that also included Brigadier General James B. Newman Jr and Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. They were impressed by both the damage done by the atomic bombs and the extensive Japanese preparations for an American invasion.
The detonation of the two atomic bombs in Japan "raised as many military and medicomilitary questions as they answered". A series of nuclear tests was planned, codenamed Operation Crossroads. Some 42,000 personnel were deployed to Bikini Atoll as part of Admiral William H. P. Blandy's Joint Task Force 1 to conduct the test. Their health and safety was Lyons's responsibility, but the specialised job of radiological safety was handled by the Manhattan Project. Warren, as Chief of the Radiological Safety Section (RADSAFE), planned and implemented measures to assess, limit and control the impact of radiation. Teams were given special training at Oak Ridge in the operation of instrumentation to measure radioactivity, and the interpretation of their readings. Training was also conducted aboard en route to Bikini Atoll, where it arrived on 12 June 1946. In all, some 3,500 personnel were assigned to RADSAFE. Warren was appalled by the effects of radioactive contamination on the environment. "The deadly range of radioactive products from the atomic bomb has been clearly demonstrated under controlled conditions..." he wrote, "the only defense against atomic bombs still lies outside the scope of science. It is the prevention of atomic war."
Warren left the Army on 6 November 1946. He temporarily became the Chief of the Medical Section of the Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian agency which succeeded the Manhattan Project. In February 1947, he was replaced by Dr Shields Warren. For his services with the Manhattan Engineer District. Warren was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Legion of Merit.
University of California.
Toward the end of World War II, a group of physicians proposed that the University of California should establish a medical school in Southern California. One of them was the urologist Elmer Belt, whose patients included the Governor of California, Earl Warren. The University of California Board of Regents voted to establish a medical school as part of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) on October 19, 1945. In 1946 the California State Legislature unanimously voted $7 million to establish the new school, and Earl Warren signed it into law.
In 1947, Warren was appointed the new school's first dean. Once again he found himself involved in creating a new medical school. His first appointments were three former associates in Rochester: Dr Charles Carpenter as the first professor of infectious disease; Dr Andrew H. Dowdy as the first professor of radiology; and Dr John S. Lawrence, who had pioneered the use of phosphorus-32 as a radioactive tracer, as professor of medicine. With Dr William P. Longmire Jr, a 34-year old plastic surgeon from Johns Hopkins University recruited by Lawrence as professor of surgery, they became the "Founding Five" of the new school. Initially, the new school was accommodated in wartime Quonset huts scattered about the UCLA campus. Warren was still wearing his army fatigues. Construction of permanent accommodation commenced in 1949. By 1951 when the first students, 26 men and two women, arrived there were 15 faculty members. By the time the first class graduated in 1955 there were 43 faculty members. The UCLA Medical Center opened in 1955.
Under Warren's leadership, the school grew steadily, adding Schools of Dentistry, Nursing, and Public Health. Against some influential opposition, Warren established his medical school on the UCLA campus rather than in another part of the city. He strove to integrate not only the structures but the faculty with other departments of the university. He fostered the development of a major biomedical library as both a tangible and intellectual link between the life sciences and the health sciences.
Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. His first wife Viola died in 1963 and on July 18, 1970 he married Gertrude Turner Hubberty. In 1971, Warren was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award. His citation read:
He died on July 26, 1981 in Pacific Palisades, California. He was survived by his wife and three children. His papers are in the UCLA Library, Department of Special Collections.

The International Association of Physics Students (IAPS) is a non-profit umbrella organization for physics students associations. Its official seat is in Mulhouse, France in the headquarters of the European Physical Society. It was founded in 1987 in Debrecen, Hungary.
Membership.
Its members may be national physics student organisations, called National Committees (NC), physics student association localised at one university or city, called Local Committees (LC) and individual members (IM) if none of the before are present where one studies. In a broad sense, members of IAPS are all the members of NC-s and LC-s and the IM-s.
International Conference of Physics Students.
ICPS International Conference of Physics Students is the International Conference of Physics Students, which is the main event of IAPS, organized yearly by one of its member committees. The purpose of the conference is to create an opportunity for physics students from all around the world to come together, to talk about science and life, to practice presenting their research and, all in all, to have a great time.
The first ICPS was organized by students of the Eötvös Loránd University, in Budapest, Hungary in the year 1986. The event had less than fifty participants, but since then, the conference has grown considerably, nowadays bringing together more than four hundred students.
The one week of the conference has its fair share of scientific, social and touristic programs. One gets a chance to listen to and give lectures on various topics in physics, to check out the laboratories of the host city, to make friends with physics students from all around the world, to get a little glimpse of the foreign cultures that gather here, and to see another part of the world.

Walter Godfrey Bowen (13 February 1922 – 2 January 1994) was a New Zealand farmer and world acclaimed sheep shearer. With his brother Ivan, he developed the Bowen Technique which involved the shearer using his spare hand to stretch the sheep's skin, which improved the quality of the shorn fleece. They also introduced the idea of shearing sheep twice a year, which is now the usual practice in New Zealand.
Bowen set a world record in 1953 by shearing 456 sheep in nine hours.
Bowen, along with George Harford set up the Agrodome in Rotorua, which is still a popular tourist spot to this day. Tourists get to see a variety of sheep on display, see a sheep shorn and go on a tour of the farm. 
He died in Rotorua of a heart attack, leaving his wife and 4 children.

Taxation in Bhutan

Taxation in Bhutan is conducted by the national government and by its subsidiary local governments. All taxation is ultimately overseen by the Bhutan Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue and Customs, which is part of the executive Lhengye Zhungtshog (cabinet). The modern legal basis for taxation in Bhutan derives from legislation. Several acts provide for taxation and enforcement only germane to their subject matter and at various levels of government, while a smaller number provide more comprehensive substantive tax law. As a result, the tax scheme of Bhutan is highly decentralized.
The duty to pay taxes is affirmed by the Constitution of 2008 individually as well as in commerce. The Constitution also confirms the ability of local governments to raise taxes in accordance to laws passed by Parliament. Under the Constitution, taxation is specifically disqualified as the subject of national referenda, leaving tax laws within the exclusive purview of Parliament.
Individual and corporate taxation.
Bhutanese law generally provides for individual and corporate taxation based on income, sales, imports, and movable and immovable property.
Bhutan has regulated corporations since 1989, most recently under the Companies Act of 2000. These regulations include taxation of corporate income. As of 2011, Bhutan's Corporate Income Tax rate was 30 percent on net profits; in addition, the Business Income Tax was another 30 percent on net profits.
In 2000, Bhutan enacted its Sales Tax and Customs Excise Act. The Act sets forth the duty to pay sales tax and excises on goods and services within Bhutan as well as customs on imports according to rates and schedules published by the Ministry of Finance. The Act also provides Department of Revenue and Customs agents broad authority to inspect, confiscate, demand accounting, and to detain, fine, and prosecute those who contravene the tax laws. The Act also sets forth a procedural framework for resolving disputes, which may be appealed to the Royal Court of Justice.
The Income Tax Act of 2001 represents the first modern, comprehensive Act on income taxation in Bhutan, for both individuals and companies. The Act also provides for sales tax, bankruptcy, and administrative processes for hearing disputes. As of 2011, the Department of Revenue and Customs imposes no taxes on the first Nu.100,000 of income; taxes up to Nu.250,000 at 10%; up to Nu.500,000 at 15%; up to Nu.1,000,000 at 20%; and Nu.1,000,001 and above at 25%. In addition, property transfers are taxed at 5%. Rural taxes are also imposed on land, houses, and cattle. Other direct duties includes the motor vehicle tax, foreign travel tax, royalties, business and professional licenses, health contribution taxes, and municipal taxes.
As part of Bhutan's program of decentralization, local governments and municipalities – including dzongkhags, gewogs, and thromdes, have been authorized to collect property, services, and transactional taxes since at least 1991. Notably, the Local Government Act of 2009 allows thromdes (municipalities) to levy a separate tax on vacancy and underdevelopment.
Other legislation authorizes or imposes taxes against particular subject matter. For example, the Tobacco Control Act of 2010 requires persons importing tobacco to pay a tax and to furnish proof of payment upon demand. Like many such laws, the Tobacco Control Act defines a set of offenses and penalties for contravening its taxation provisions.
Use of tax money.
The government either allocates tax revenues for specific state expenditures or deposits them into a Consolidated Fund. The government uses the Consolidated Fund according to budgets passed by law, and may also make grants and investments for the public interest. The national budget is overseen by the Finance Minister, who reports regularly to the National Assembly. 
The Pay Commission, an independent government body, establishes the pay rate and expenditure budget for members of government. Public expenditure of collected funds is governed by the Public Finance Act of 2007.
Tax exemptions.
Under the Constitution of Bhutan, the Royal Family receives annuities set by Parliament and is exempted from taxation.
Registered civil society organizations ("CSOs") are exempt from tax on income or other gains earned as a result of investing endowed property or other funds in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Department of Revenue and Customs. The two types of CSO, Public Benefit and Mutual Benefit Organizations, may be granted exemptions from customs duties or other taxes besides income taxes on a case by case basis under sets of regulations and procedures issued jointly by the Civil Society Organizations Authority and the Department of Revenue and Customs.
No customs or duties are levied on goods imported into Bhutan from India, as per the nations' Agreement on Trade and Commerce.
Foreign diplomatic missions, international organisations, and government agencies are generally exempted from paying customs duties and sales tax. Under the Sales Tax Act, the Ministry of Finance may also exempt any other person from sales, customs, and excise taxes at its discretion. Organizations exempt from customs duties must still pay sales tax when importing goods into Bhutan, however.
Vehicle import tax controversy.
Taxation has been a topic of controversy since democratization in Bhutan. In June 2010, the first democratically elected government of Bhutan revised the import duty scheme on imported light private vehicles, raising taxes without following the procedures for bicameral presentment and debate required by the Constitution. The move was supported by some Bhutanese as curbing congestion and pollution while promoting mass transit development. The National Assembly opposition party contested the action in the High Court of Bhutan, Constitutional Bench, winning the initial suit. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Bhutan, the Attorney General argued that the tax revision was supported by pre-constitutional laws on direct and indirect taxation that remained unrepealed. The Attorney General also argued against judicial reviewability of political actions, a position based largely in United States jurisprudence developed by Louis Brandeis and supported by American case law. In December 2010, while the lawsuit was pending, the government ordered a halt of all imports subject to the tax, a move the opposition criticized as contempt of court. On February 24, 2011, the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the High Court ruling against the government. The government lifted the import ban in early March 2011 and stated its intention to refund the taxes it had collected illegally, although it may reintroduce the tax revisions and pass them in the constitutional process. The government, though shaken by the ruling, has declared it will not resign over the debacle.
After the controversy, the World Bank in its Financial Management Accountability Assessment warned that Bhutan's financial matters needed better legislative scrutiny. The World Bank cited inadequate examination and debate in Parliament before passing budgets, which include tax schedules. Furthermore, the World Bank decried the inability of Parliament to modify proposed budgets, but only to ratify proposals of the Ministry of Finance.
History.
During the reign of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (1594–1651), taxes in Bhutan were levied by penlops (regional governors). In 1965, Ashley Eden described the taxation in Bhutan as not so much a system as "squeez as much as possible out of the people under them." Modernly, governmental authority was fully consolidated in 1907 with the establishment of the Wangchuck Dynasty and the modern state of Bhutan.
Before the 1960s, the Bhutanese government collected taxes in kind and in the form of "labor contribution". Taxes in kind were gradually phased out in favor of nominal monetized taxes on land, property, business income, and consumption of good and services.
In 1961, the National Assembly established the Gyaltse Kha Lowa (Accounts and Audit Committee) to oversee government revenue and properties. In 1968, the National Assembly made the Gyaltse Kha Lowa into the Ministry of Finance under the impetus of increasing development. In 1971, the Ministry saw the establishment of its Department of Customs, later to become the Department of Revenue and Customs, responsible for implementing much of the tax law.
In 1974, the Royal Government began experimenting with decentralization, devolving some governmental powers – including taxation – to the municipalities of Thimphu and Phuntsholing.
The Bhutanese government enacted major reforms to the tax structure in 1989 and again in 1992. The reforms of 1989 included Bhutan's first business income tax, replacing its previous 2% turnover tax; abolishing export and nuisance taxes; and exempting plant machinery from sales and import duties. The 1992 reforms aimed to simplify administrative procedures for compliance and transparency.

It's a Great Life

"It's a Great Life (also known in syndicated reruns as The Bachelors") is an American situation comedy which aired on NBC from 1954 to 1956. Frances Bavier, six years before being cast as Aunt Bee in CBS's "The Andy Griffith Show", played a somewhat similar role as Mrs. Amy Morgan, the owner of a boarding house.
Synopsis.
Frances Bavier stars as Mrs. Amy Morgan, the owner of a boarding house. Harry Harvey portrayed Mr. Russell, a neighbor. Two of her tenants are returning World War II veterans, played by William Bishop and Michael O'Shea in the roles of Steve Connors and Denny Davis, respectively. The former servicemen portray vacuum cleaner salesmen. James Dunn played Amy's brother-in-law, Earl Morgan, something of a deadbeat often pushing "get-rich-quick" schemes to entice Steve and Denny. Dunn's role was loosely comparable to that of Edgar Buchanan as Uncle Joe Carson in CBS's rural comedy, "Petticoat Junction", starring Bea Benaderet as Carson's sister, Kate.
Steve and Denny are single in the series and in their spare time seek the companionship of women, including Amy's beautiful daughter, Cathy "Katy" Morgan played by Barbara Bates. Bates appeared in twenty-six episodes. Guest stars included Parley Baer, Madge Blake, George Chandler, Phyllis Coates, Angie Dickinson, King Donovan (six episodes as Chris Norman), Richard Deacon, Hope Emerson, Douglas Fowley, Joseph Kearns, Nancy Kulp, Joi Lansing, Barbara Nichols, Doris Packer, Maudie Prickett, Tyler McVey, William Schallert, Randy Stuart, Lyle Talbot, Dolores Fuller, and Mary Treen.
Production notes.
The series was filmed at Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California. David Rose, also the arranger for "The Red Skelton Show", is particularly cited for his theme music composition on this series. In its first season, "It's a Great Life" aired at 10:30 p.m. EST Tuesdays opposite CBS's "See It Now". In the second season, the series was switched to 7 p.m. EST on Sundays preceding "Frontier" western anthology series on NBC. With the switch in time, it aired opposite the second season of "Lassie" on CBS.

Arnold Jacques Chadwick

Flight Commander Arnold Jacques Chadwick was a Canadian-born World War I flying ace credited with 11 aerial victories. He became an ace twice over; once while flying Sopwith Pups and again while piloting Sopwith Camels.
Early life.
Arnold Jacques Chadwick was born in Toronto, Canada on 23 August 1895. He was the only son of C. W. Chadwick; the elder Chadwick was the manager of Colonial Realty Corporation.
World War I.
Chadwick joined the Royal Naval Air Service and was commissioned as a temporary Flight Sub-Lieutenant on 30 December 1915. He originally served in 5 Naval Wing after being trained. On 2 October 1916, while on a bombing raid aimed at Zeppelin hangars, he was shot down. He managed to evade capture and escape to the neutral country of the Netherlands. Once repatriated, Chadwick was assigned to 4 Naval Squadron in Bloody April 1917. Using a Sopwith Pup dubbed DO-DO, he scored his first aerial victory on 26 April 1917, driving down a German Albatros D.II fighter plane out of control.
On 25 May 1917, Chadwick destroyed an Albatros reconnaissance two-seater in the vicinity of Bray Dunes in the early morning. That same evening, he teamed with Langley Frank Willard Smith and two other British pilots to attack and destroy a German Gotha G multi-engine bomber north of Westende. The following day, he shared in a victory southwest of Furnes, when he and Albert Enstone destroyed a German recon machine. On 3 June 1917, he crashed an Albatros D.V to become an ace on Sopwith Pups.
Naval 4 then upgraded to Sopwith Camels. Chadwick would first score with one of them on 25 June, when he flambeed an Albatros recon two-seater over Roulers. On 3 July 1917, he drove down a German recon machine over Ghistelles. Three days later, he would share in the destruction of an Albatros two-seater in the same area. On a 10 July evening patrol, he drove down an Albatros D.V, then aided Ronald Keirstead to drive down a second one. Chadwick was now a Camel ace.
On 25 July 1917, Chadwick, Enstone, and Keirstead joined to destroy a German seaplane northward of Ostend. It was Chadwick's final victory. Three days later, he singlehandedly assaulted a formation of nine German airplanes. Losing the battle, he was forced to ditch in the English Channel off the coastal town of La Panne. His drowned corpse would wash ashore near Dunkirk on 17 August 1917.
On 11 August 1917, Chadwick was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in an unusual joint citation. He, Albert Enstone, Langley Frank Willard Smith, and Alexander MacDonald Shook were cited for: "...exceptional gallantry and remarkable skill and courage whilst serving with the
R.N.A.S. at Dunkirk during May and June, 1917, in repeatedly attacking and destroying hostile aircraft.

Federated Marine Stewards' and Pantrymen's Association of Australasia

Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association of Australasia was an Australian trade union established in 1884, and existing as a federal union from 1909 to 1988. The association represented marine stewards and stewardesses, marine pantrymen and crew attendants. The union operated a closed shop, with all workers employed in the industry members of the union, and operated on a 'no OK card - no job' principle.
Politics.
For most of its history the union had poor relations with the more radical, left-wing maritime trade unions due to the strong communist influence in these organisations, and was aligned with the right wing of the Labor movement, as represented by the Democratic Labor Party. The Marine Stewards' Association resisted industry-wide strike action in August 1935, when members of the Seamen's Union of Australia advocated a strike over pay and conditions. The Marine Stewards' Union was the first maritime union to admit women into its membership, albeit initially in very low numbers and only on passenger ships.
Robert James (Bob) Heffron, who would later become the Premier of New South Wales between 1959 and 1964, was for a number of years in the 1920s the Secretary of the NSW Branch of the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen's Association.
Amalgamation.
Despite a long history of proud independence, the association began to consider amalgamation during the 1980s, as generational change reduced animosity with other maritime trade unions, and changes in the industry, such as automation and a reduction in passenger travel by sea, reduced the membership base. The process of amalgamation with the Seamen's Union was initiated in 1985, and completed in 1988. Amalgamation reduced the cost of running a small organisation, and allowed more concerted action on board ships, where previously up to 8 separate unions could have had coverage on a ship of 40, with each union holding separate meetings. The greater industrial strength of the new SUA (later to amalgamate with the Waterside Workers' Federation to become the Maritime Union of Australia) led to achievements, including new hiring arrangements which gave greater job security to ships' stewards.

Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Regency Route

The Regency Route is a name given since 1977 to a regular bus service between Brighton in East Sussex and Tunbridge Wells in Kent, both towns with a Regency heritage. The route runs via the East Sussex towns of Lewes, Uckfield and Crowborough.
The Brighton—Tunbridge Wells route is one of few successful examples of bustitution, as it replaced through trains from Brighton via Lewes and Uckfield to Tunbridge Wells withdrawn in the 1960s when the railway lines from Lewes to Uckfield and Eridge to Tunbridge Wells were closed by British Railways. The bus route now provides access to the Lavender Line and the Spa Valley Railway preserved railways which run on lengths of those two railways. The journey from end to end is timed at between 1¾ and 2 hours.
Originally operated jointly by Southdown Brighton & Hove (now Brighton & Hove), Southdown East Sussex (now Stagecoach), and Maidstone & District (now Arriva), the service is now operated solely by Brighton & Hove. Since April 2011, Brighton & Hove has used the "Regency Route" branding for the Route 28 service from Brighton to Lewes and Ringmer as well as the 29.

Dugald Campbell Patterson

Dugald Campbell Patterson Sr., (January 2, 1860 – June 25, 1931) is recognized in Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster, British Columbia as a significant pioneer. He arrived in Canada on July 1, 1884 and engaged in the building trade while living in Victoria. In 1894 he moved to Burnaby where he acquired a five acre parcel of land which today forms the north east section of Central Park. Patterson worked as an engineer for Armstrong Morrison & Balfour and later became foreman boilermaker for the Vancouver Engineering Works. He founded Vulcan Iron Works of New Westminster in 1903, was the first postmaster of the Edmonds district in 1909 and was a member of the New Westminster Board of Trade in 1911. He was elected a Burnaby school trustee in 1912, was a director of the British Columbia Electric and Water Heat Company and owned and operated a real estate business where he purchased and developed properties as far away as Barkerville. He also founded and operated an insurance company for many years. Patterson Avenue, which he originally cleared as a trail, and Patterson Station, where he built the original interurban stop along the British Columbia Electric Railway, are named for the family.
Patterson was born in Partick, Lanarkshire, Scotland on January 2, 1860. He was one of three sons born to John Murdoch Paterson of Rutherglen, and Margaret (Purdon) Paterson of Partick. He attended the Glasgow common school, and worked as a ship joiner at Barclay Curle & Company (founded in 1818) in Whiteinch, Scotland. He was later employed in the Anchor Line Shipyards (founded in 1856) in Partick. After his arrival in Canada, he added a second "t" to the spelling of his last name which changed it from "Paterson" to "Patterson". On February 7, 1891 in Victoria, British Columbia, he married Frances Mabel Webb, a granddaughter of Thomas Webb, founder of Thomas Webb & Sons makers of fine English glass. Together, Dugald and Frances Patterson raised seven children.
In 1915, during World War I, Patterson accepted a commission by the British government to travel overseas to supervise a group of Canadians in the construction of submarines for the Royal Navy on the River Clyde near Glasgow, Scotland. It was here that he sustained an injury which left him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Upon his return home, he remained active in both municipal affairs and the arts. He developed a plan that would preserve ravines as parks in Burnaby, and he published a book of poetry prior to his death in Vancouver in 1931. The family home, known today as Dugald and Frances Patterson House, has been a heritage landmark in Burnaby since 1994, and is listed on the "Canada's Historic Places" website. Other notable Patterson family members include William Harold Patterson, a son who was a First World War veteran and captain in the Canadian Army, and Doreen Patterson Reitsma, a Canadian naval pioneer who was a granddaughter of Dugald Campbell Patterson.

Robert Perceval Armitage

Robert Perceval Armitage (21 December 1906 - 1990) was a British colonial administrator who held senior positions in Kenya and the Gold Coast, and was Governor of Cyprus and then Nyasaland during the period when the former British colonies were gaining independence.
Early years.
Armitage was born on 21 December 1906 in Nungambakkam, Madras, the first child of Frank and Muriel Armitage. His father was commissioner of police in Madras city. At the age of ten he was sent to Highfield School at Liphook, Hampshire, where he was captain of the cricket team in his final year. From 1920 to 1925 he attended Winchester College. He became a district and secretariat officer in Kenya.
Armitage married Gwladys Lyona Meyler (b. 2 May 1906, Natal) on 18 February 1930 in Highlands Cathedral, Nairobi, Kenya. Their children were Robert Jeremy, born on 16 June 1932 in Poole, Dorset, England and Richard Hugh Lyon, born on 30 May 1937 in Canford Cliffs, Dorset, England.
Gold Coast.
In July 1948, Armitage was financial secretary of the Gold Coast. After the governor had said he was willing to consider the creation of an agricultural bank, Armitage said his government was "deeply committed in principle" to taking action and "would find it difficult to retreat".
In 1949, Armitage was chairman of a committee to consider establishing a national bank. He tried to dampen nationalist demands by ruling out the idea of a Reserve Bank, but did not succeed.
By 1950, Armitage was Minister of Finance of the Gold Coast.
At the end of 1950 the colonial government proposed to increase export duties on cocoa. The world price for the crop was rising, and the government felt that the planters would waste increased profits on luxuries, while the government would use it for development plans. Armitage was prepared to face opposition from cocoa producers, but prayed for five years of rising world prices to solve all economic problems.
Armitage recommended appointment of a first-rate economic expert to manage the economy during the cocoa boom. He said the country "is rapidly moving out of the extremely restricted economy of the years before the war and so the holder should be someone who has experience of financial and economic matters, at least in other parts of Africa and possibly experience from other parts of the world".
In his budget speech in 1953, Armitage explained the policy he had followed: "(Sterling) balances have accrued ... largely because the raw materials produced in the Gold Coast, mainly cocoa, have brought in large earnings and the Government ... increased taxation partly in an endeavor to lessen the amount of money which would exert an inflationary pressure ... and partly to build reserves."
Armitage did not mention that the project to build the Akosombo Dam over the Volta River was starting to seem feasible, and funds would be needed for that purpose.
The Gold Coast gained independence in 1957 as Ghana.
Cyprus.
Armitage was Governor of Cyprus from 1954 until 25 September 1955. 
At the time of his appointment there was growing agitation by the Greek Cypriots for "enosis", or union with Greece, although this was opposed by the Turkish Cypriots. The Greek government supported the movement, but the British did not want to give up an important base in the eastern Mediterranean.
Few of the Greek Cypriots were willing to compromise. In September 1954, Armitage said that the self-styled moderates had "no organisation, no party, no funds, no agents and they will win nothing".
An attempt was made on Armitage's life on 1 April 1955. Bombs exploded all over the island on that day as EOKA insurgents opened a violent campaign for self-determination. 
Armitage asked for permission to declare a state of emergency in July 1955, but this was not granted. 
For several months Armitage tried to find a way to deport Archbishop Makarios and the Bishop of Kyrenia, both of whom publicly supported union with Greece. Existing laws did not cover the situation of the Archbishop, who advocated a peaceful approach. A state of emergency was eventually declared, which allowed for deportation without cause. By then, Armitage had been replaced as governor by Field Marshal Lord Harding of Petherton, leaving office in September 1955.
Nyasaland.
Unrest and State of Emergency.
Armitage arrived in Nyasaland on 9 April 1956 to take over from Geoffrey Colby as Governor. One of the main issues he had to face was the unpopularity of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which had come into being in 1953.
He resisted proposals to "federalize" administration of European farming, a serious concern with the indigenous population.
He also resisted moves to make the federation independent. He said that moving too quickly towards the status of a Dominion could "stimulate early and violent African opposition, which would at best discredit Federation and at the worst break it".
In September 1957 he met a delegation from the Nyasaland African Congress headed by its president TDT Banda, who asked for legislative reforms including an elected legislative assembly with most members elected by Africans. He also met representatives of Charles Matinga's Progressive Party, who were seeking to follow a more moderate path, with nominated representatives to work with the government. He summarised the views of Matinga's party as: "In other words they wanted a lot of friendly Africans and Europeans to collaborate with friendly officials. But, of course, politics cannot be this easily organized".
Several of the younger members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith in the ability of T D T Banda, who they also accused of dishonesty, and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda (no relation), then living in the Gold Coast. Dr Banda announced he would only return if given the presidency of Congress: after this was agreed he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted. Banda and Congress Party leaders started a campaign of direct action against federation, for immediate constitutional change and eventual independence. As this included resistance to Federal directives on farming practices; protests were widespread and sometimes violent.
In January 1959, Banda presented Congress proposals for constitutional reform to Armitage. These were for an African majority in the Legislative Council and at least parity with non-Africans in the Executive Council. Armitage rejected these proposals, and this led to demands within Congress for an escalation of anti-government protests and more violent action. On 18 February 1959 there was an attack on Fort Hill by a mob armed with pangas. As Congress supporters became more violent and Congress leaders made increasingly inflammatory statements, Armitage decided against offering concessions, but prepared for mass arrests. Armitage met Southern Rhodesia officials and Governor Sir Arthur Benson of Northern Rhodesia, and made plans to concentrate federal troops in Nyasaland.
On 21 February, European troops of the Rhodesia Regiment were flown into Nyasaland and, in the days immediately following, police or troops opened fire on rioters in several places, leading to four deaths. In deciding to make widespread arrests covering almost the whole Congress organisation, Armitage was influenced by a report received by the police from an informer of a meeting of Congress leaders at which, it was claimed by the Head of Special Branch that the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of those Africans opposed to Congress was planned, the so-called "murder plot". There is no evidence that such a plan existed, and the Nyasaland government took no immediate action against Banda or other Congress leaders but continued to negotiate with them until late February.
On 3 March 1959 Sir Robert Armitage, as governor of Nyasaland, declared a State of Emergency over the whole of the protectorate and arrested Dr. Banda, its president, and other members of its executive committee, as well as over a hundred local party officials. The Nyasaland African Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial, and the total number detained finally rose to over 1,300. Over 2,000 more were imprisoned for offences related to the emergency, including rioting and criminal damage. The stated aim of these measures was to allow the Nyasaland government to restore law and order after the increasing lawlessness following Dr Banda's return. Rather than calming the situation immediately, in the emergency that followed fifty-one Africans were killed and many more were wounded.
The Devlin and Armitage reports.
In the debate in the House of Commons on 3 March 1959, Alan Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary, stated that it was clear from information received that Congress had planned the widespread murder of Europeans, Asians and moderate Africans, “…in fact, a massacre was being planned” and, later in the same debate, the Minister of State at the Colonial Office, Julian Amery, reinforced what Lennox-Boyd had said with talk of a “…conspiracy of murder” and “a massacre… on a Kenyan scale”. It was subsequently difficult for ministers to repudiate these statements.
Harold Macmillan decided to set up a Commission of Inquiry headed by Lord Devlin exposed the failings of the Nyasaland administration, and concluded it had lost the support of those it governed. The Devlin Commission's report is the only example of a British judge examining whether the actions of a colonial administration in suppressing dissent were appropriate. Devlin's conclusions that excessive force was used and that Nyasaland was a "police state" caused political uproar. His report was largely rejected and the state of emergency lasted until June 1960. Macmillan not only broadly rejected the Devlin Report, which had taken several months to prepare, but engineered the production of the rival Armitage Report, which was prepared very quickly so it could be released on the same day as the Devlin Report. The Colonial Office obtained an early draft of the Devlin Commission’s report and passed a copy to Armitage, which he used to prepare a document attacking its findings. Armitage then joined a high level working party in London which drafted a despatch to counter the Devlin Report.
Leaving Nyasaland.
The Nyasaland African Congress, which had been banned in 1958, was re-formed as the Malawi Congress Party in 1959. Banda's detention became a political issue in the 1959 general election in the United Kingdom, although the Conservatives retained power.
Under pressure from the press, the government decided to release Banda in March 1960.
Armitage had imprisoned Banda, not realising that he was the only African politician who could negotiate a credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached for advice. Armitage, on the other hand, was discredited and he was seen by Macleod saw Armitage as an obstacle to progress. Although Macleod gave Armitage instructions to arrange for rapid constitutional advancement in May 1960, which set the country on the road to one-party rule., he advised Armitage to go on leave pending retirement in August 1960. Glyn Smallwood Jones became acting Governor until Armitage retired in April 1961. Armitage retired without returning to Nyasaland in April 1961.
Armitage died in Amesbury, Wiltshire, England, on 7 June 1990 at the age of 83. He was buried in Bridstow, Herefordshire.

George Hetzel

George Hetzel (1826 – 1899) is a French-born American artist. He is regarded as the founder of the Scalp Level School of painting, a contemporary to the French Barbizon School of Naturalist painting. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting.
Life and work.
Born in an ethnically mixed part of Alsace, France on January 17, 1826; Hetzel’s family spoke primarily German and emigrated to the United States when he was aged two. They travelled from a Baltimore port to a small farm in Allegheny City, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hetzel attended Allegheny City school and was apprenticed to a local sign- and house-painter. After four years' training, he earned an artisan’s apprenticeship, painting the interior murals of riverboat public rooms and local Pittsburgh saloons. 
George was sent to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf between 1847–49 and studied Da Vinci’s Chiaroscuro (the use of light and dark shadows to heighten depth and drama), which became a signature stroke in his later works. 
It is thought that Hetzel was first introduced to the bucolic setting of Scalp Level (at the intersection of Paint Creek and Little Paint Creek outside of Johnstown, Pennsylvania) around 1866 during a fishing trip. He was then an instructor at the Pittsburgh School of Design for Women and encouraged his colleagues and students to make Scalp Level their summer retreat and work "en plein air".
Hetzel exhibited at the National Academy in New York between 1865-1882 and at the Pennsylvania Academy until 1891. He was included in the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and shown in the first Carnegie International in 1896. He also exhibited at the World's Columbian Exposition, 1892-1893. The J. J. Gillespie Gallery sold his works and he kept an independent studio. His career was established before the Scalp Level works, but they are currently foremost in his legacy.
Other Scalp Level artists.
Associated Artists include A. F. King, Clarence Johns, E. A. Pool, Charles Linford, Fred Bussman, A. S. Wall, Joseph R. Woodwell, Bryan Wall, George Lang, C. C.
