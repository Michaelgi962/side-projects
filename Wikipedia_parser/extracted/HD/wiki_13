Take a Little Ride

"Take a Little Ride" is the title of a song written by Dylan Altman, Rodney Clawson and Jim McCormick, and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean. It was released to country radio and iTunes on July 16, 2012, serving as the lead single from his fifth studio album, "Night Train", released on October 16, 2012.
Content.
The song "Take a Little Ride" revolves around the happenings of a man getting off work, and going to pick up his love interest that night to take her out for a drive in his Chevy truck. It is in the key of A major with a chord pattern of E-G-D-A.
Eight days after the song's release, Broken Bow Records released a re-recording of the song, in which the line "a little Shiner Bock" is changed to "a couple Rocky Tops", in reference to Coors beer. This re-recording was done because Aldean had signed an endorsement deal with Coors.
Critical reception.
Billy Dukes of "Taste of Country" gave "Take a Little Ride" a four-star review, praising the song's "colorful" and "welcoming" verses, and stating how "ballads like 'Laughed Until We Cried' balance rockers like 'She's Country,' but he’s at his best on songs that find the sweet middle". It received three out of five stars from Jessica Nicholson of "Country Weekly", who thought that the lyrics were "a little generic" but said that the "in-your-face production and signature Southern rock groove combine to make this unmistakably Jason's."
Matt Bjorke of "Roughstock" gave the song a four-star review, saying that Aldean was "relaxed, confident, and deliver a song that fits exactly what we've come to expect from a superstar."
Music video.
The music video was directed by Shaun Silva and premiered on August 10, 2012.
Chart performance.
"Take a Little Ride" debuted at number 19 on the "Billboard" Country Songs chart for the week of August 4, 2012. It also debuted on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart at number 12, and the Canadian Hot 100 chart at number 22 the same week, Aldean's highest debut in Canada thus far. The song also made history on Country Digital Songs, moving 189,000 downloads during the tracking week ending July 22, marking the biggest opening week by a male artist. On the country chart dated October 6, 2012, "Take a Little Ride" became his eighth number-one single. The song has sold over a million digital downloads as of January 2013.

1841 rebellion in Guria

The 1841 rebellion in Guria (, "guriis ajanq'eba"; , "myatezh v Gurii") was a conflict in the former Georgian principality of Guria, at that time part of the Georgian–Imeretian Governorate of the Russian Empire, that took place as a reaction to the government's newly introduced duties and taxes for the Georgian peasants. The rebels, joined by several nobles, were initially successful in overrunning much of Guria, but they were finally defeated by the Russian army and the allied Georgian nobility in September 1841.
Background.
Guria, a small and poor Georgian rural province on the Black Sea, had been under the Russian hegemony since 1810. In 1829, the Russians eliminated the local autonomous princely rule and imposed a Russian administration. The province had already been a scene of anti-Russian insurrection in 1820 and would gain more notability with a popular Social-Democratic uprising in 1905.
Rebellion.
In 1841, without regard to local conditions, the Russian government ordered Gurian peasants to cultivate potatoes and to pay their taxes in Russian cash. Guria still maintained a primarily natural economy based on corn and millet. Rumors began to spread among the peasants that money payments would soon be required and that peasants would be drafted into the army.
When the tax collections began in May 1841, the peasants of the Lanchkhuti community resisted and took to arms on May 22, 1841. The disturbances spread through all Guria and soon the rebels had almost 7,200 men in their ranks. They took control of most fortified points in the province and blocked roads leading to the city of Kutais. On August 9, 1841, the insurgents headed by Abes Bolkvadze clashed with the Russian troops of Colonel Brusilov at Gogoreti, inflicted heavy casualties upon them and forced Brusilov to retreat. Twice that month the Gurians tried but failed to take Ozurgety, the principal town of Guria and the last remaining outpost of the Russians. Dissension within the rebel ranks led to the defection of many noble allies, most importantly of Prince David Gugunava. Eventually, on September 5, some 2,500 regular Russian troops under Colonel Moisey Argutinsky-Dolgorukov—aided by the volunteer units provided by the pro-Russian nobles—attacked the rebels and defeated them, killing more than 60. By late September Guria was again calm and under the Russian control, but the government made no further effort to collect taxes in cash or cultivate potatoes. By 1842, most arrested rebel leaders were released, except Prince Ambako Shalikashvili, who was banished to Siberia. According to a Russian source published in 1901, the Russian losses in the rebellion were at least 32 killed, 115 wounded, and 17 captured.
The rebellion was described by the peasant writer Egnate Ninoshvili (1859–1894) in his historical novel, "The Revolt in Guria" (ჯანყი გურიაში), which was screened by the pioneering Georgian film director Alexander Tsutsunava in 1928.

Garima Chaudhary (born April 2, 1990 in Meerut) is an Indian judoka. She represented India as the country's sole judoka in the Women's (63 kg) category at the 2012 London Olympics.
Childhood and early training.
Born to parents hailing from a middle class family, Chaudhary was inclined to sports during her childhood. She was good at sports such as kabaddi, athletics and cricket. While Chaudhary's father remained concerned about her education, her mother constantly supported her interest in sports. She represented her native state of Uttar Pradesh initially. Due to lack of suitable support from the state's sports association, she began representing Haryana in national-level competitions.
Since 2004, Chaudhary has been training with Jiwan Sharma and Divya Sharma at Patiala-based National Institute of Sports. Due to lack of proper facilities, she had to practice with boys. Chaudhury found this to be a good way to train. Sharma says that attributes such as self-belief, hard work and a winning attitude are Chaudhary's strengths.
2012 Summer Olympics.
She participated at the 2011 World Judo Championships held in Paris and at the World Cup as a part of her qualification for the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the 2012 Asian Judo Championships held in Tashkent, she finished seventh in the 63 kg category. As a result of her performances, she earned 34 points and the eligibility to represent India at the London Olympics.
In order to prepare for the Olympics, Chaudhary trained in Germany and France. She underwent a more competition-oriented training, studied her opponents, and focused on specific fitness aspects.
In the first elimination round of the Women's (63 kg) category at the 2012 London Olympics, Chaudhary was defeated by Yoshie Ueno by an Ippon in 81 seconds. Although this ended her challenge at the Olympics, India's sports administrators felt that she is a good medal prospect at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the Incheon Asian Games — both in 2014.

List of Members of the United States House of Representatives in the 16th Congress by seniority

This is a list of members of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 16th United States Congress by seniority. For the most part, representatives are ranked by the beginning of their terms in office.
As an historical article, the districts and party affiliations listed reflect those during the 16th Congress (March 4, 1819–March 3, 1821). Seats and party affiliations on similar lists for other Congresses will be different for certain members.
This article describes the criteria for seniority in the House of Representatives and sets out the list of members by seniority. It is prepared on the basis of the interpretation of seniority applied to the House of Representatives in the 112th Congress. In the absence of information to the contrary, it is presumed that the twenty-first-century practice is identical to the seniority customs used during the 16th Congress.
House seniority.
Seniority in the House, for Congressmen with unbroken service, depends on the date on which the members first term began. That date is either the start of the Congress (4th March in odd numbered years, for the era up to and including the 73rd Congress starting in 1933) or the date of a special election during the Congress. Since many members start serving on the same day as others, ranking between them is based on alphabetical order by the last name of the congressman.
Congressmen, in early Congresses, were often elected after the legal start of the Congress. Such representatives are attributed with unbroken seniority, from the legal start of the congressional term, if they were the first person elected to a seat in a Congress. The date of the election is indicated in a note.
The seniority date is normally taken from the members entry in the "Biographical Directory of the United States Congress", except where the date given is the legal start of the Congress and the actual election (for someone who was not the first person elected to the seat in that Congress) was later. The date of election is taken from "United States Congressional Elections 1788-1997". In a few instances the latter work provides dates, for the start and end of terms, which correct those in the Biographical Directory. 
The Biographical Directory normally uses the date of a special election, as the seniority date. However, mostly in early Congresses, the date of the member taking his seat can be the one given. The date of the special election is mentioned in a note to the list below, when that date is not used as the seniority date by the Biographical Directory. 
Representatives who returned to the House, after having previously served, are credited with service equal to one less than the total number of terms they served. When a representative has served a prior term of less than two terms (i.e. prior term minus one equals less than one), he is ranked above all others whose service begins on the same day.
Leadership.
In this Congress the only formal leader was the Speaker of the House. A Speakership ballot was held on December 6, 1819 and Henry Clay (DR-KY) was re-elected for a fifth consecutive Congress (although he had resigned, during the 13th Congress on January 19, 1814, so his service had not been continuous). Henry Clay received 147 votes and there were 8 scattering votes. 
Speaker Clay resigned before the convening of the second session on November 13, 1820. The second Speakership election, during this Congress, took place between November 13-15, 1820. John W. Taylor (DR-NY) was elected, on the twenty-second ballot. In the final ballot, Speaker Taylor received 76 votes, William Lowndes (DR-SC) had 44, Samuel Smith (DR-MD) 27 and 1 was scattering. 
The title Dean of the House (sometimes known, in the nineteenth century, as Father of the House) was held by the member with the longest continuous service. It was not a formal leadership position.
Standing Committees.
The House created its first standing committee, on April 13, 1789. There were nineteen standing committees, listed in the rules initially used by the 16th Congress. Two additional committees were added during the Congress. The Committee on Manufactures was created on December 8, 1819 and the Committee on Agriculture was provided for by a resolution passed on May 3, 1820.
Committees, in this period, were normally appointed for a session at a time by the Speaker. However the resolution of March 30, 1816, which created the committees on departmental expenditures and Expenditures on Public Buildings, provided for those standing committees to be appointed for the whole Congress.
This list refers to the standing committees of the House in the 16th Congress, the year of establishment as a standing committee, the number of members assigned to the committee and the dates of appointment in each session (or if appropriate for the Congress), the end of the session (if appropriate) and its chairman. Chairmen, who were re-appointed after serving in the previous Congress, are indicated by an *. 
The first session was December 6, 1819-May 15, 1820 (162 days) and the second session was November 13, 1820-March 3, 1821 (111 days).
Note:-
List of Representatives by seniority.
A numerical rank is assigned to each of the 185 members initially elected to the 16th Congress. Other members, who were not the first person elected to a seat but who joined the House during the Congress, are not assigned a number (except for the representative from the newly admitted state of Alabama, who is assigned the number 186). The first representative from the newly admitted state of Maine, was elected to a seat transferred from Massachusetts and is not assigned a number.
3 representatives-elect were not sworn in. 1 was unseated after an election contest (NY-1: Sage) and 2 resigned (GA-al:Forsyth;NJ-al:Condict). The list below includes the Representatives-elect (with name in italics), with the seniority they would have held if sworn in.
Party designations used in this article are DR for Democratic-Republican members and F for Federalist representatives. Designations used for service in the first three congresses are (A) for Anti-Administration members and (P) for Pro-Administration representatives.

Omar (TV series)

Omar () or Farouk Omar () is a historical Arab television drama series that was produced and broadcast by MBC1 and directed by Hatem Ali. Co-produced by Qatar TV, the series is based on the life of Omar ibn Al-Khattab, the second Caliph of Islam. The series had to face large controversy due to its depiction of Omar, Abu Bakr, Uthman and Ali, the four Rashidun Caliphs, along with other characters, who some Muslims believe should not be depicted much like the Prophet Mohammad. The series consisted of 30 episodes and was originally aired in the month of Ramadan since July 20, 2012. It was made at a cost of 200 million Saudi riyals and filmed in Morocco, mostly in Marakesh, Tangiers, El Jadida, Casablanca and Mohammedia. After the series was broadcast on MBC, dubbed into several languages and subtitled in English on YouTube, it received great support from many different scholarly bodies and people watching it. As the series depended solely on reliable historical established facts, the series did not face criticism in terms of its content, as past movies and films faced.
Trivia.
Two actors of these series, Hassan Al-Jundi and Muna Wassef, were both also actors of Abu Jahl and Hind bint Utbah in the Arabic version of Moustapha Akkad's 1976 film Mohammad, Messenger of God (aka "The Message").

Beltane Park

Beltane Park is a football ground located in Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is the home ground of Central Division Two side Wishaw Juniors. 
The ground was formed after years of Wishaw Juniors playing outwith the town and at the nearby Wishaw Sports Centre. In 2010, Wishaw Juniors secured a 10-year lease to use Beltane Park as the home ground. Since then, the once open-grassed area has been transformed into a football ground, with terracing along the east side of the ground, and fencing around the whole pitch. Also recently installed at the venue are toilets, a snack bar, a players lounge and dressing rooms, with each of them based in portacabins.
Known locally as "The Beltane", the ground has a capacity of around 500 spectators,and was officially opened on 28 July 2012, when Wishaw Juniors played the under-17's of the local senior side Motherwell.
The annual town music festival Be in Belhaven will be moving to Beltane Park for one year only in 2012 from its normal Belhaven Park spot. This is due to Wishaw Town Centre modernzation works.

Alfredo Guati Rojo

Alfredo Guati Rojo Cárdenas (December 1, 1918 – June 10, 2003) was a 20th-century Mexican artist who worked to restore the reputation of watercolor painting as a true art form. His preference for the technique came from seeing Diego Rivera’s work and helping with a fresco mural in his hometown of Cuernavaca as a child. When he was 16, he went to Mexico City to study law, but switched to art. He learned the various classic art techniques but kept his preference for watercolor. His career began by teaching art, founding an art institute in the Colonia Roma section of Mexico City. In the 1950s, he tried to get the areas art galleries to show watercolors but they refused, considering it as a minor art form. He began to host exhibitions of watercolor works at his art institute with success which led to the formation of the Museo Nacional de la Acuarela or National Watercolor Museum in the 1960s. The museum remained in Colonia Roma until the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed the building and led to it relocation to the Coyoacán borough where it remains. During this time, Guati Rojo also had a career showing and selling his own artwork, almost exclusively watercolors in various parts of the world. Most of his income from this painting went to support the museum.
Life.
Alfredo Guati Rojo Cárdenas was born on December 1, 1918 in Cuernavaca as the only child of María de Jesús Cárdenas and José Guati Rojo Ramírez. He spent his childhood listening to the stories of his paternal grandfather and traveling much of Mexico as his father was a criminal lawyer.
He began drawing and painting images from his hometown of Cuernavaca when he was in primary school at about age seven. However he believed that it was seeing the murals of Diego Rivera on the wall of the Palace of Cortes that inspired him to be an artist. He had a primary school art teacher, Luis Betanzos, who recognized the boy’s talent. Betanzos was also associated with Eduardo Solares of the Academy of San Carlos. When Solares came to Cuernavaca to paint a new fresco, Guati Rojo was selected to be an assistant. This gave him his first experience in water based paint.
At age 16, he left Cuernavaca for Mexico City to study at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria, living at his grandfather’s house. He then enrolled into law school as his father wanted to continue the family tradition. However, he soon decided that he did not like law and wanted to transfer to the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas . Despite strong opposition from his father, his mother was supportive and he made the switch. He progressed rapidly and began working at an assistant to his teachers. These earnings allowed him to buy watercolor supplies. Many of these early small paintings are part of the Museum’s permanent collection. He graduated in 1940, and although trained in various techniques, he kept his preference for watercolor painting.
That same year, he was awarded the “Águila Azteca” (Aztec Eagle) for his cultural work in Central and South America along with Ignacio Beteta . He also married Berta Pietrasanta, the sister of one of his art school classmates, Orlando Pietrasanta. The marriage lasted sixty four years, with her working with him on projects, most notably the running and promotion of the National Watercolor Museum after it was founded. They never had children, but the couple considered the museum as such. In 1995, they wrote a “Carta a mi hijo el Museo” (Letter to my child, the Museum) as testimony. Berta died in May 2003. This along with impending blindness due to disease made Guati Rojo depress and he died only a few weeks later on June 10, 2003.
Career.
Guati Rojo’s career began teaching art, starting from 1937 and teaching more or less full-time in various public and private schools until 1969. In 1954 he founded the Instituto de Arte de México in Colonia Roma. This institute offered shorter courses in the fine arts then traditional institutions and offered classes in ceramics, fashion design and jewelry making as well. The institute was located on the ground floor of the house he and his wife lived in. Here he gave classes and occasionally hosted cultural events.
Guati Rojo was one of the first promoters of watercolors in Mexico. In the 1950s, he tried to get watercolors shown at galleries in Colonia Roma but could not because water color was considered only a “minor art.” So his Institute became the first place in Mexico City to exhibit watercolors as a serious art form. The shows at the institute began to have success and favorable reviews, leading watercolor artists in the city to sell their work. In 1955, part of the institute became the site of the first Salón Nacional de Acuarela (National Exhibition of Watercolors), an annual event which continues to the present. At first Guati Rojo was the judge of the works and bought many of the winning pieces.
About a decade later, he founded the Sociedad Mexicana de Acuarelistas in 1964 along with Gustavo Alanís, Edgardo Coghlan, Manual Arrieta, Jesús Ochoa and Teresa Miranda. He remained the organization’s president until his death in 2003. From the time he graduated from college, he had gathered a large collection of watercolors, starting with those of her former teachers and his past and present students. This collection became the base of Museo Nacional de la Acuarela or National Watercolor Museum, the first of its kind in the world in 1967.
Guati Rojo and the Sociedad tried to get the government to fund a museum site but without luck. Guati Rojo founded another group, the Amigos del Museo de Acuarela (Friends of the Watercolor Museum) with the aim of operating the museum independently at the house in Colonia Roma, spending two years presenting shows and concerts to raise money. During this time, from the 1960s and 1970s, he also worked at the head of Diffusion Cultural of the Desarrollo Integral de la Familia agency and in 1971 he became the head of the Departamento de Artes Plásticos at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes.
The watercolor museum continued to operate in the building in Colonia Roma until the 1985 Mexico City earthquake destroyed it. However, the loss of the building prompted the government to purchase the museum’s current site at Salvador Novo 88 in the Coyoacán borough, an expensive section of the city. After this, the government said it would do no more. From 1985 until his death, he and his wife renovated the large house, with the gardens around the main house designed by the two, which includes a “poetic space” dedicated to the indigenous poet-king Nezahualcoyotl. In addition to its exhibition of its permanent collection and temporary shows, the museum arranges shows of Mexican watercolors all over the world. This has helped Mexican artists and given the institution renown. The museum is the first of its kind in the world, and is partly responsible for the re acceptance of watercolor as a serious art form. Guati Rojo founded the Bienal de la Acuarela (Watercolor Biennal) at the museum in 1992.
His work founding the museum was accompanies by a long career of producing artworks, almost exclusively watercolors. His first exhibit was in 1947, and since then his work was shown individually and collectively in many countries of the world including Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy, France, Great Britain, Japan, the United States, New Zealand, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, Canada and Venezuela as well as in many parts of Mexico. His works are found in museum collections in many parts of the world, including the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel, the Urawa-Saitama Museum in Japan, Boliviano de Arte Contemporáneo in Colombia, and Asociación Italiana de Acuarelistas de Milan in Italy as well as his National Watercolor Museum in Mexico. Near the end of his life, he was famous enough to sell painting just by announcing its start and not even showing it to the buyer. Much of the income from his own work went to supporting the museum.
Shortly before his death, he lost most his sight. His last painting called Desde las sombras (From the shadows) (2003), was done while he was nearly blind. It was painted in as an abstract, printing in black using his hands.
Over his career, Guati Rojo received recognition as a member of the Legión de Honor Nacional, the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana, the Royal Society of Arts of England, Agrupación de Acuarelistas de Cataluña, International Association of Fine Arts of UNESCO, Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour and the American Watercolor Society .
Artistry.
He was considered one of the best watercolor artists and art promoters of Mexico in the 20th century. His main focus in life was to restore watercolor’s reputation as a true art form. At the time, watercolor was relegated as a minor art, associated with old women, hobbyists and England of the 19th century. It fell out of favor in the 19th century with the advent of lithographic portraits and landscapes. Large oil paintings came to be seen as the only true art, with the small size of watercolor and their transparency thought of as insignificant. One of his defenses of the art is that fresco is really watercolor, over plaster instead of paper, using the fresco murals of Diego Rivera as examples. He also claimed that the British did not invent it as water based pigments have been used from prehistoric times. Guati Rojo also considered watercolor essential to Aztec civilization as the codices were written with water based paints on amate paper.
Unlike most watercolor artists, who paint on surfaces which are horizontal to keep the paint from running, Guati Rojo painted on vertical surfaces. He defied the effect of gravity by painting thin strokes also giving the images more exactness. He is quoted as saying "Water, for me, has always had its mystery. Watercolors do what they want to do. You can´t change them for anything… No one can really say they have dominated the technique. Every time I start a new painting I am terrified that I will fail." Although he did not do self-portraits, he included his likeness in some of his works. One of these is Salome (1984) where the face of John the Baptist is that to the artist with a beard. In El circo de la vida, Guati Rojo appears as one of the clowns. In Homenajo a mi madre (Homage to my mother)(1983), he appears with empty eyes.

1974–75 Leicester City F.C. season

During the 1974–75 English football season, Leicester City F.C. competed in the Football League First Division.
Season summary.
In the 1974–75 season, Leicester could not improve on last season's 9th place, finishing 9 places lower. Goalkeeper Peter Shilton refused to sign a new contract and followed his mentor Gordon Banks by signing for Stoke City at a record fee for a goalkeeper of £325,000 in November and resulted in Mark Wallington starting the season in goal. From early November to late February, the Foxes didn't register a league win in 13 games which saw them slip to bottom of the table and heading for relegation but again their FA Cup progress gave them a boost in their league form. As the season drew to a close, Chris Garland improved their strike force by scoring 8 goals in 10 matches, which was enough to save the Foxes from the drop in 18th and 3 points clear of relegation.

New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards

The New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards are a series of literary awards presented annually to recognise excellence in children and young adult's literature in New Zealand. The awards and administered and organised by Booksellers New Zealand, an industry organisation which represents over 90% of New Zealand booksellers. The awards are presented at the end of a 10-day festival organised by the New Zealand Book Council celebrating children's literature and literacy, held annually in May.
The current awards, sponsored by New Zealand Post, were established in 1997, though they have had three incarnations since they were first created in 1982. Prior to 1997, they were known as the AIM Children's Book Awards, which were created in 1990. Before that, the awards were known as the New Zealand Government Publishing Awards, which ran from 1982 to 1988. In 2003 their name was changed to the New Zealand Post Book Awards for Children and Young Adults, though they have since resumed using their former name.

No awards were presented in 1989, but in 1990, Unilever New Zealand (then the New Zealand manufacturer of Aim toothpaste) created the AIM Children's Book Awards. The awards originally contained two categories — Fiction, and Picture Book. Second and third prizes were originally awarded, though these were replaced with honour awards in 1993, presented at the judges' discretion. More categories were added over time: Best First Book in 1992 (not presented 1994–5); Non-Fiction in 1993, when Fiction was split into two categories (Senior Fiction and Junior Fiction); and AIM Book of the Year in 1995.
In 1997, the awards became the New Zealand Post Children's Book Awards, and another new category was added, the New Zealand Post Children's Choice award. In 2004, the Senior Fiction category was renamed to Young Adult Fiction.
In April 2013 the New Zealand Post Book of the.Year award's name was changed to honour the late New Zealand children's author Margaret Mahy, and became known as the New Zealand Post Margaret Mahy Book of the Year award.

Zarkashan Mine

Zarkashan is a mine located approximately 225 km south-west of Kabul in the Ghazni Province, Afghanistan. Ghazni city is approximately 93 km north of the project area. The German Geological survey conducted a reconnaissance survey in the mid-1960s and the Soviets and the Afghanistan Geological Survey (AGS) conducted exploration in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Recently the USGS assessment of the mineral potential in Afghanistan included ongoing compilation of historic German and Soviet mapping, geophysics data, drilling and sampling data, and incorporation into a GIS database using Esri products. There are many ancient open pit and underground workings that show that this area has been mined in the past. The grades obtained by the Soviet and AGS exploration team show that the skarn mineralisation has a core of relatively high gold grades with a halo of lower grades.
Road access to the site from Kabul is on Highway A01, which is a paved highway. Power can potentially be brought in from the nearby grid at Ghazni, or from a dedicated self-supplied source.

Louis Napoleon George Filon

Louis Napoleon George Filon FRS (22 November 1875 – 29 December 1937) was a French-born English applied mathematician, famous for his research on classical mechanics and particularly the theory of elasticity and the mechanics of continuous media. He also developed a method for the numerical quadrature of oscillatory integrals, now known as "Filon quadrature". He was Vice Chancellor of the University of London from 1933–35.
Early life.
He born at Saint-Cloud, near Paris, as the only child of Augustin Filon, the French "littérateur" who was appointed as the official tutor to the Prince Imperial. Accompanying the Prince Imperial in his exile, the Filon family came to England in 1878 and lived at Margate. He was educated at Herne House School in Margate.
Career.
In 1894 Filon became a student at University College, London and received his BA in 1896 with a gold medal in Greek. He was appointed in the college as Demonstrator in Applied Mathematics under the supervision of Karl Pearson. He spotted a mistake in Pearson's lectures and the correction was incorporated into a joint publication with Pearson. This important paper was Filon's only publication in statistics.
In 1898 Filon went to King's College, Cambridge on an 1851 Exhibition Research Fellowship for advanced study. In 1902 he earned a doctorate from University College, London and in 1903 he became there a lecturer in pure mathematics under M J M Hill. In 1910 Filon was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1912, upon Pearson's retirement, Filon was appointed to the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University College, London. Except for an academic leave during his military service in the First World War, he occupied this chair until his death in 1937. Filon was also Director of the University of London Observatory from 1929 to 1937. He was the author of over 50 papers and three books (one as co-author with E. G. Coker).
He was a member of the University of London Senate (1920) and the Court, Dean of the Faculty of Science, Chairman of the Academic Council (1924–33) and Vice-Chancellor (1933–35). During his term of office, the foundation stone was laid for the university's Bloomsbury headquarters.
Personal life.
In 1904 he married Anne, eldest daughter of Professor Philippe Godet, of the University of Neuchâtel and had a son and two daughters. He died in Croydon from typhoid during a local epidemic.

Ventiford Brook

</pre>
Ventiford Brook is a stream located in Devon, England.
It was used as one of the water courses that filled the Stover Canal, when it was in use, along with the River Teign and River Bovey. There are plans to restore the canal, in which case the Ventiford Brook would probably need to be the main source of water for the canal.
The brook was also used as the basis for filling Stover Lake, which is located in the Stover Country Park near Bovey Tracey.

Hugo d'Oignies

Hugo of Oignies, C.R.S.A., (, b. Walcourt, before 1187; d. Oignies, c. 1240) was a lay brother of Oignies Priory. He was a metalworker and painter and is the last of the great jewelers of Mosan art. He is a representative of the school of the Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse and was considered the greatest artist of the Meuse Valley of his time.
Life.
In 1187 Hugo helped to found what became the Priory of St. Nicholas, along with his three brothers, all of whom were priests, when they moved from their native city in the County of Namur to live a monastic style of life by a small country chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra near Oignies in the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Little is known of Hugo himself before 1228, when his works at the priory were first noted. Without doubt, he trained as a goldsmith. Hugo was literate, a master scribe, and a miniaturist. He signed many of his works. In circa 1230, Hugo produced a manuscript and silver book covers for the monastery. The book cover contains depictions of Hugo and St. Nicolas, the monastery's patron saint.
During a visit to the priory in 1228 or 1229 to consecrate an altar, Jacques de Vitry, C.R.S.A., Bishop of Saint-Jean d'Acre and later cardinal, became a patron of his work. Around that time, Hugo created what are considered among his masterpieces, an Evangeliary and a reliquary. He crafted a series of pieces in silver: reliquaries, monstrances, and other objects of worship, of which three signed pieces still exist. 
In his work, the human figure merges with the technical virtuosity with which the artist treats the decor's watermarks, crimping delicate cabochons. He provided works of art for the monastery. These included liturgical objects such as crosses, chalices and other religious artifacts which are considered to be masterpieces of metalwork.
Legacy.
When the priory was overrun and the community of canons regular scattered by forces of the French Revolutionary Army in 1796, its treasures were hidden by the last Prior of Oignies at a farm in Falisolle. After the death of the farmer, the treasure became entrusted in 1818 to the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, who were being founded in that period. In 1939, when the Nazi invasion of Belgium at the start of World War II threatened the convent and its treasure, it was moved and escaped the destruction of the convent. After the reconstruction of the convent buildings, the treasure was returned to the Sisters, who placed it in a specially-equipped room in their convent, one of the smallest museums in the world.
In early 2010 they were moved again, this time to the Museum of Ancient Arts in Brussels.
The "Encyclopedia Britannica" says of his contribution to Gothic metalwork, "The growing naturalism of the 13th century is notable in the work of Nicholas' follower Hugo d’Oignies, whose reliquary for the rib of St. Peter in Namur (1228) foreshadows the partly crystal reliquaries in which the freestanding relic is exposed to the view of the faithful; it is decorated with Hugo’s particularly fine filigree and enriched by naturalistic cutout leaves and little cast animals."

Liberto

Liberto is both a given name and a surname of Italian descent.
Etymology.
The term liberto derives from , which means a freed slave. In ancient Greece, those freed slaves had various kinds of obligations toward their former owners and they did not have full citizens rights.
In ancient Rome they were called , a freedman (feminine: "liberta") or an emancipated person who acts for and on behalf of its former master, who became his patron (). During the Empire period and after the judgment of a magistrate they were freed from a . Despite being freed by manumission and acquiring the Roman citizenship and a legal personality, they did not have the same legal rights of the free-born and were excluded from the main offices, maintaining a subordinate position and many obligations on behalf of their former masters, which can be summarized in three duties: (obedience; respecting the patron as a father), (work), and (honesty; masters maintain the right of inheritance). This status could be revoked by . During the late imperial period a liberto can achieve the full status of naive by .
However, the name Liberto has also been traced to the unrelated Germanic name Albrecht.
Notable people.
Notable people with the surname include American homemaker Vivian Liberto, who was the first wife of country singer-songwriter Johnny Cash, and the mother of singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash. Its derivative form Diliberto includes Italian politician Oliviero Diliberto.
Notable people with the given name include Liberto Corney, an Uruguayan boxer who competed in the 1924 Summer Olympics, and Liberto dos Santos, a Portuguese footballer who played as forward.

Oldest buildings in Scotland

This article lists the oldest extant freestanding buildings in Scotland. In order to qualify for the list a structure must:
This consciously excludes ruins of limited height, roads and statues. Bridges may be included if they otherwise fulfill the above criteria. Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by radiocarbon dating and should be considered approximate.
The main chronological list includes buildings that date from no later than 1199 AD. Although the oldest building on the list is the Neolithic farmhouse at Knap of Howar, the earliest period is dominated by chambered cairns, numerous examples of which can be found from the 4th millennium BC through to the early Bronze Age.
Estimates of the number of broch sites throughout the country, which date from the Iron Age, range from just over 100 to over 500. However, only a small percentage are sufficiently well preserved for them to be included here.
As there are relatively few structures from the latter half of the first millennium AD and a significant number from the 12th century, the latter group is placed in a sub-list. There are larger numbers of extant qualifying structures from 1200 onwards and separate lists for 13th-century castles and religious buildings are provided. As the oldest buildings in many of the council areas in the more urbanised Central Belt date from after the 14th century a separate list showing oldest buildings by council area is provided.
There is also a supplementary list of qualifying structures for which no confirmed date of construction is available and a short listing of substantial prehistoric structures that are not buildings as defined above.

She had already won at the age of 17 a medal on the European Championship of −20, when she was only 17. 2009, she became European champion and got the 5th spot on the cchampionship in the category −20 years. As a reward for this, she got the Sports Merit Trophy awarded by the French Community. 2010, she won at her first European Championship in the senior's series a bronze medal.
In 2012 Van Snick won the silver medal at the European Championships. On Saturday 28 July 2012, she won a bronze medal on the Olympic Games 2012 in London. In the qualifying round, she passed the Corean Jung-Yeon Chung with ippon. In the quarter-finals, she beat the Hungarian Éva Csernoviczki with ippon. She lost the semi-finals against the later Olympic champion Sarah Menezes with yuko. The game which decided the bronze medal was won against the Argentinian Paula Pareto, after the latter got a second shido.
In April 2013 Van Snick won the Silver Medal at the European Championships, losing in the finals from Csernoviczki. 
Doping ban.
In August 2013 Van Snick won a bronze medal at the World Championships in Rio de Janeiro. On 14 October 2013 it was announced that Van Snick had tested positive for cocaine in Rio. Van Snick maintains her innocence. On 29 October 2013 it was announced that a hair analysis that Van Snick commissioned with the KUL's toxicology lab proved negative for habitual cocaine use. Toxicological research proved the presence of 2,3 picogram cocaine per milligram in the hair strain for the period 10 August to 10 October 2013, which is 200 times less than the amount in a strain for a habitual user, and a complete absence of cocaine in the part of the strain dating before 10 August. However, on 30 November 2013 it was announced that the official counterexpertise also showed positive for cocaine. On 3 January 2014, she was banned by the IJF for a period of two years. Van Snick announced she will appeal the ban with the CAS. On July 4, 2014, the CAS decided that Van Snick's appeal would be upheld only partially. Although she still was found guilty for committing a doping offence, the CAS believed that there was sufficient doubt as to her intention to commit doping hence it annulled her 2-year ban. However, unlike Van Snick herself claimed in some newspapers, the CAS did not clear her of the doping violation hence her results obtained during the Judo World Championships in Rio de Janeiro 2013 remain annulled and her bronze medal revoked.

He played, like his brother, for Prince of Wales Country Club, from Santiago. He was an international player for Chile, even in a single match, in 12 August 1938, with Argentina, in Buenos Aires, in a 3-33 loss. It was the first ever international tour of Chile.
A dual British and Chilean citizen, he joined the Royal Air Force, in 1941, haulting then his rugby career. He was a pilot with the Bomber Commander, being killed in action during a raid over Germany, in 12 September 1944.
He was inducted at the IRB Hall of Fame on May 2012, among his brother Ian Campbell, who was present. Donald was represented by his son, Colin. Ian said: "This is a huge honour for me and I couldn't be more pleased at the fact that Donald has been included in this induction as well. He was my sporting hero. So much so that as a young boy all I wanted was to be able someday to play rugby, cricket or hockey (at all of which he excelled) with him when I grew up."

The 316th Sustainment Command is the U.S. Army’s first transformation-era modular ESC unit, and the first to deploy to Iraq. The 316th transformed from a traditionally structured force to one designed to better address sustained military operations and missions and the nation’s emergency rapid response.
The 316th is a model for future military operations around the world with a deployment mission to provide command and control of all sustainment forces in an operational theater.
While in Iraq (August 2007-June 2008), the 316th ESC, composed of more than 20,000 sustainment Soldiers, synchronized and provided logistical support to U.S. units (165,000), Multi-National Coalition partners and Iraqi Forces in support of all operations. That support translated into everything from bullets to beans, fuel to maintenance parts and coordinating certain human resource services (liaison teams, personnel replacements, finance).

Justo Pérez de Urbel

Justo Pérez Santiago (August 7, 1895 – 1979) later known as Fray Justo Pérez de Urbel y Santiago O.S.B. was a Spanish Roman Catholic clergyman (Order of Saint Benedict) and medievalist, first abbot of the Monastery of the Holy Cross of the Valle de los Caídos, member of the Consejo Nacional del Movimiento (the first quasi-parliamentary assembly of Francoist Spain), later a Procurador en Cortes (member of the longer-lived Francoist assembly established after the end of the Spanish Civil War) and distinguished scholar of medieval Castile.
Life.
Born in Pedrosa de Río Úrbel, Burgos, Spain, Pérez Santiago entered the monastic school of the nearby Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos at age 12 in 1907. He enrolled in the order in 1912, and was ordained 25 August 1918. He was already a well-known religious and historical writer during the era of the Second Spanish Republic.
In mid-1938, during the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalists established the headquarters of their Women's Section in the Salesian convent of Burgos. At that time, Pilar Primo de Rivera sought someone capable of leading the spiritual organization of the religious life of that organization. Severino Aznar, father of Agustín Aznar, commented that at the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos there was a spiritual and erudite monk who would doubtless be good for the job. Pilar took this counsel, proposing Pérez Santiago's candidature to abbot Luciano Serrano.
That year Pérez Santiago was named director of the new Nationalist children's magazine "Flechas y Pelayos", formed by a merger of two earlier magazines, "Flechas" and "Pelayo"; he was also involved in "Clarín" and "Maravillas". He was joined at "Flechas y Pelayos" by Aróztegui and Pilar Valle. The merger of "Flechas" and "Pelayo" was intended, among other things, to overcome confrontations between two different factions within the Nationalist camp. Besides directing the magazine, he also "Doctrine and style" section. 
After the Nationalists won the Civil War, he was named Prior of the Church of Montserrat in Madrid (associated with the abbey of Silos) and chaplain of the Women's Section of the Falange. At the same time, he was designated as the person to approve or reject applications to establish new comic books.
Pérez Santiago was a member of the Consejo Nacional del Movimiento (the first quasi-parliamentary assembly of Francoist Spain). He became a Procurador en Cortes when the first legislature of the Francoist Cortes Generales was convened 16 March 1943.
Pérez Santiago's first notable writing was poetry he wrote while still a student at Silos. Also at Silos, he became acquainted with several languages, acquiring fluent French, decent English and German, and a good familiarity with Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Arabic. In 1925 he published the first of what would eventually be 71 books in the fields of hagiography, history, liturgy and art. From the outset, he wrote for a wide variety of audiences, ranging from academic works to works for children.
He received his doctorate from the Complutense University of Madrid in 1950. That same year, by means of a competitive exam, he became Professor of Medieval Spanish History at that same university. He was also Honorary Counselor of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and Director of the Colegio Mayor "Marqués de la Ensenada".
On 17 July 1958, in the presence of the Undersecretary of the Presidency Luis Carrero Blanco and Minister of the Interior Camilo Alonso Vega, he was invested as the first abbot of the Basílica de Santa Cruz of the Valle de los Caídos. The benediction of the basilica was given by the abbot of Santo Domingo de Silos, Isaac María Toribios who performed a mass and formally invested him as abbot. Pérez Santiago remained an abbot until 1966, when he resigned for health reasons.
On 15 November 1967 he became a member of the tenth National Council of FET y de las JONS.
Works.
Pérez Santiago published 71 books and more than 700 articles, reviews, and translations. Among his more noted works in the field of history are:
Among his hagiographic and liturgical works are:

Someone Was Watching is a 1993 novel written by David Patneaude about a boy who believes his missing little sister didn't actually drown in a river, but was kidnapped.
Plot summary.
After taking a family trip to their summer cabin the weekend before Memorial Day, 13-year-old Chris is supposed to be watching his toddler-aged sister, Molly. However, he takes a moment to wander away for a few minutes to film scenery with his video camera, and eventually falls asleep for a few minutes. When he wakes up, he returns to Molly only to find his parents have also fallen asleep and Molly is gone.
When her coloring book is found at the end of a nearby dock, it is believed that the little girl has fallen into the river drowned. Days of searching turn up nothing, and many assume that Molly's body was pulled too far downstream and is lost.
Six months later, Chris makes a discovery on his video camera that may prove that Molly didn't drown in the river that day. Instead, he believes, she was taken and may still be alive. With the help of his best friend, Pat, the two set off on a journey to Florida to discover the truth.

<doc id="36568814" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36568814" title="David Smukler">
David Smukler

David Smukler (May 28, 1914 – February 22, 1971), also known as “Dynamite Dave,” was an American football player who played in 36 National Football League games, mostly for the Philadelphia Eagles in the late 1930's. He was also the star player for the Temple University Owls in the inaugural Sugar Bowl game on January 1, 1935, in New Orleans, Louisiana.
High school.
The youngest of seven children, Smukler was born in Gloversville, New York, to Russian immigrants. His family moved to Newark, New Jersey, in 1918, where he played tackle at East Side High School in 1929 and 1930, earning all-State honors the second year. Still in his teens, he returned to Gloversville to live with his oldest brother Lewis and became his apprentice, learning to shear gloves from skins. Playing football at Gloversville High School, Smukler was taken out of the line by Coach Lawrence A. (Duke) Miller and made into a fullback. He had never kicked a football for any team before, but he spent hours by himself punting the ball. Smukler kept his muscles strong by walking five miles uphill after every practice. When the football season began, he was considered a “one-man team” and lost only one game. Besides excelling in football, Smukler was also a high-scoring guard on the basketball team and a member of the track team. In May 1932 he participated in the annual Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute interscholastic track meet in Troy, New York, and broke two state records, the 12-pound shot put and the discus throw.
College.
Smukler enrolled in the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, and played fullback under Frank Carideo. He left before the year ended and continued to learn glove cutting under his brother Lewis. In September 1933 Smukler transferred to Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was chosen to play varsity fullback by Glenn “Pop” Warner one year later. After Smukler helped the Temple Owls achieve many wins, Warner stated, “He is a better fullback now than Ernie Nevers was in Nevers’s sophomore year. Dave is the best sophomore fullback I have ever seen. He may become the greatest fullback I have ever seen, a greater football player than Nevers or Jim Thorpe.” The coach also commended him as a defensive player, kicker, and forward passer, stating that “he combines fine judgment with his versatility. He is not the type that will get puffed up by praise, either.” Smukler played five consecutive games without ever letting the ball slip from his hand.
On January 1, 1935, he played against Tulane University in the inaugural Sugar Bowl game in New Orleans, Louisiana. When the teams were awaiting kickoff, Tulane’s slogan was “Stop Smukler.” Smukler passed for one touchdown, kicked the extra point, and ran for a 25-yard touchdown. His efforts brought the Owls a 14-0 lead, but Tulane would ultimately beat Temple with a score of 20-14. Smukler was described after the game as “a wild bull, a mad elephant, a rip-roaring locomotive, a human-battering ram. He was 212 pounds of speed and power, who asked nothing more of his own line but that it get out of his way and let him run.”
Smukler temporarily withdrew from Temple in December 1935 due to a knee injury but returned at the start of the second semester. However, in March 1936 Smukler announced that he was leaving Temple again for a business position that was "too promising to refuse." He never graduated.
Professional Football.
It was announced in August 1936 that Smukler had a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. Apparently, the contract was signed two months before, but it was not announced earlier due to the uncertainty of Smukler's injury. He played with the Eagles for four seasons from 1936-1939. During his first year he had a career high of 99 rushes for 321 yards.
Steve Owen, coach of the New York Giants, identified the Eagles as one of the teams he most feared “because they are dangerous any time Dave Smukler, the erstwhile Temple Terror, carries the ball.” Apparently, team owner Bert Bell once said that nobody could stop Smukler “when he was having a good day.” On Oct. 2, 1938, the Eagles played the Chicago Bears at Philadelphia Municipal Stadium. The National Football League (NFL) program described Smukler as a “Powerhouse ball carrier and backer up on defense. Brilliant forward passer and terrific punter. Fifth best passer in the National Football League last year, completing 42 of 118 throws for a total gain of 432 yards. Carried ball from scrimmage 92 times to gain a total of 247 yards.”
After playing 34 games with the Eagles, Smukler was suspended in October 1939 for breaking training rules. When owner Bert Bell asked him why, Smukler allegedly told him, “I’m through with football.” Apparently, Smukler had broken training rules various times in the past. He had made a pledge to Bell that this would not happen again, only to break training once more. Bell said, “In my opinion, Dave was one of the greatest football players in professional football when he wanted to be. But I believe for the best interests of the team and myself we can do better without him as he was a demoralizing influence. He is a good boy but he just can’t keep his promises.”
In April 1940 he was traded to the Detroit Lions in exchange for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told you what a swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going to do when I couldn’t play football anymore. I sat down and figured it out and then decided my best bet was the Army.”
Smukler was in active service for over three years. After serving as a first sergeant in Iceland, he received a medical discharge due to his old knee injury. He went back to work as a glove cutter in Gloversville and helped coach the football team at Gloversville High School. Smukler considered returning to football with the Detroit Lions, but he never appeared on their gridiron and was sold to the Boston Yanks in 1944. Smukler played only two games for the Yanks before ending his professional football career.
Later Years.
In 1946 Smukler moved to California and was employed for three years as a station manager with the Standard Oil Company. He later worked in tire sales and held managerial posts with different companies. In 1947 it was reported that he joined the football coaching staff at Loyola University in Los Angeles as an end coach. Smukler later became West Coast commissioner for the Pop Warner Conference. He founded the Pop Warner Conference in Los Angeles and received the group’s first Joe Tomlin All-American Award for “service beyond the call of duty.”
At time of his death Smukler was general sales manager for Bridgestone Tire Co. of America, Inc. He was stricken with a heart attack at Los Angeles International Airport while preparing to board a plane for a sales meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Smukler was 56 years old. He had suffered from heart trouble and underwent surgery seven years earlier for the installation of a pacemaker.
Notes.
There is disagreement among sources as to whether David Smukler was born in Gloversville, New York, or Newark, New Jersey. The article “Smukler’s Parents Wed 55 Years Ago” (The Morning Herald, March 16, 1949) states that his parents moved from Gloversville to Newark in 1918, four years after his birth. This would suggest that he was born in Gloversville, NY. The California Death Index also states that he was born in the state of New York.
Most sources, including the California Death Index, state that he died on February 22, 1971. However, his obituary "Grid Great Dave Smukler Dead at 56" (Amsterdam Recorder, February 24, 1971) suggests that he died on February 23, 1971.
His obituary "All-American Dave Smukler, Ex-Glover Star, Dies At 57" (Schenectady Gazette, February 1971) states in the title that he died at age 57, but the obituary itself states that he died at age 56. All other records suggest or state that he died at age 56.

Frédéric Viret

Frédéric Viret was a French choirmaster, composer of sacred music and leader of a well-established society of amateur male and female choristers of high vocal range and very rare quality among most choristers in Paris. Besides being an autodidat painter, a poet and amateur photographer, he was a remarkable musician who sought and found inspiration in the depths of his soul.
Biography.
A pupil of the masters of the Church of Saint-Merri and Saint-Roch, he was also kapellmeister of the Imperial Church of Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois from 1854, with several scholarly associations appointing him a founding member of the "Société des sciences industrielles, Arts et Belles lettres de Paris" and the "Société libre des Beaux-Arts." Praised for his sensitivity, he was admired for his fine character, the warmth of his singing and the beauty of his voice.
At sixteen he was deemed capable of directing the choir at Saint-Merri. He conducted masses performed by an orchestra composed of one hundred and fifty artists together with scholar J. B. Stiegler, a member of the Bavarian Academy of Music whom he had met in Paris and accompanied to Germany while he perfected in the art of singing, and organist Johann Peter Cavallo with whom he had published "Les Veillées des Salons," a musical magazine of piano music and singing scores.
Selected works.

London Symphony Orchestra filmography

The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) has been associated with the cinema since the days of silent film. During the 1920s the orchestra played scores arranged and conducted by Eugene Goossens to accompany screenings of "The Three Musketeers" (1922), "The Nibelungs" (1924), "The Constant Nymph" (1927) and "The Life of Beethoven" (1929). 
Since 1935 the LSO has recorded the musical scores of more than 200 films. The orchestra owed its engagement for its first run of soundtrack sessions to Muir Mathieson, musical director of Korda Studios. On the LSO's website, the film specialist Robert Rider calls Mathieson "the most important single figure in the early history of British film music, who enlisted Bliss to write a score for "Things to Come", and who was subsequently responsible for bringing the most eminent British 20th-century composers to work for cinema." Mathieson described the LSO as "the perfect film orchestra". Among the composers commissioned by Mathieson for LSO soundtracks were Vaughan Williams, Walton, Britten and Malcolm Arnold and lighter composers including Eric Coates and Noël Coward.
As a pinnacle of Mathieson's collaboration with the LSO, Rider cites the 1946 film "Instruments of the Orchestra", a film record of the LSO at work. Malcolm Sargent conducted the orchestra in a performance of Britten's "The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra", composed for the film. Rider adds, "Mathieson's documentary, with its close-ups of the musicians and their instruments, beautifully captures the vibrancy and texture of the Orchestra amidst the optimism of the post-Second World War era." 
A later milestone in the LSO's history in film music was in 1977 with the recording of John Williams's score for the first of the six "Star Wars" films. Rider comments that this film and its sequels "attracted a new group of admirers and consolidated the period of film music activity for the Orchestra, which continues unabated to this day". The LSO also recorded other Williams film scores, including "Superman" (1978) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981).

Overleigh Cemetery

Overleigh Cemetery is located in Grosvenor Road on the south side of the River Dee in Chester, Cheshire, England. The original part of the cemetery is listed by English Heritage at Grade II in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.
History.
The cemetery was laid out between 1848 and 1850 by T. M. Penson. This part of the cemetery is described by the authors of the "Buildings of England" series as having been "highly romantic", and as still being "eminently picturesque". It was opened in 1850 and was consecrated on 12 November by the Bishop of Chester. In 1875 the cemetery contained a lake with three islands, two chapels, two lodges, paths and trees, and a house for the chaplain. It was extended to the south in 1879 (this part is not included in the listing), and in 1904 a new chapel was built in this part of the cemetery. In 1930 the cemetery came into the ownership of Chester City Council, and it was further extended to the south during the 20th century. Penson's lake, lodges and chapels are no longer present. The south part of the cemetery is described as being "prosaic".
Notable structures.
The gates and gate piers designed by Penson at the original entrance to the cemetery are still present, and are designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. Also listed at Grade II is a bridge over the drive in the north section of the cemetery, which was designed by Penson. In the north part of the cemetery, and listed at Grade II, are the following monuments: to John Graham, Bishop of Chester who died in 1865, to William Makepeace Thackeray (1769-1849), uncle of the novelist of same name, to U Larsing, a missionary to Bengal, who died in 1863, to Revd Richard Knill, who died in 1857, and his wife, who died in 1870, to Samuel Venables, master of Chester Bluecoat School, who died in 1848, to William Brown of Browns of Chester, who died in 1852, and to Henry Raikes, Chancellor of the diocese of Chester (designed by Penson, with an effigy by Thomas Earp). In the south part of the cemetery is a monument to Frederick Coplestone who died in 1932. It dates from 1934, was designed and carved by Eric Gill, and is listed at Grade II*. Also in the south part of the cemetery, and listed at Grade II, are the west chapel, and a cenotaph, in form of a Cross of Sacrifice, to those who died in the First World War.
Another notable gravestone in the cemetery, although not listed, exists to Edward Langtry, (estranged first husband of actress Lily Langtry), who died in a local lunatic asylum in 1897.
Another notable gravestone in the cemetery, with an epitaph "Far From The Bones Of His Ancestors" in both English and Japanese, is that of the Japanese actor Ishiao Ishimura, one of the acting team "The Mikado Family", who died on stage in December 1915 in the Royalty Theatre in Chester when he fell and broke his neck.
War Graves.
The cemetery contains the graves of 197 Commonwealth service personnel, 127 from World War I (about half of them burials from local hospitals,) and 69 from World War II. Apart from a small war graves plot containing 32 graves from both wars, the graves are dispersed throughout the cemetery.

Enevold Kruse (October 28, 1554 – March 8, 1621) was a Danish nobleman who served as Governor-general of Norway from 1608 to 1618. 
After studying abroad, including in Helmstedt, Germany, he was employed in 1578 at the Danish chancery and his career advanced rapidly. He served in the Danish Treasury (responsible for accounting, payment and collection of customs duties and taxes, as well as management of state property, including forests, roads and buildings) beginning in 1582, and retained that position until 1608. In 1608, he was named feudal lord to Akershus in Norway, Governor-general of Norway and a member of the Danish national council. He served as commander for the Norwegian forces during the Kalmar War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden from 1611 to 1613. As Governor-general, he accomplished relatively little in his latter years, falling into disagreement with Norwegian nobleman Jens Bjelke, who was the Chancellor of Norway. 
During the last three years of his life, 1618–1621, he was named feudal lord at Tranekjær on Langeland in Denmark. He died at Sjælland.

Underbank Chapel

Underbank Chapel is a Unitarian place of worship in Stannington, a suburb of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. It is a member of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella organisation for British Unitarians.
It stands in a rural situation, 6 km west of the city centre on Stannington Road, overlooking the Loxley Valley. The building is Grade II listed. In 2012 the minister is June Pettit.
Underbank Schoolroom, which is closely associated with the chapel, stands 50 metres to the south-west. It is also a Grade II listed building.
History.
The congregation dates its founding to 1652, when it first began to meet in a converted barn on an adjoining site. This was established when Richard Spoone left land and a building in his will to establish a “preaching minister”. As the chapel was founded during the Commonwealth of England, the minister was of the Presbyterian denomination. The setting up of this chapel of ease allowed the people of the Stannington district to worship locally for the first time, as prior to this the nearest church was the Church of St Nicholas at High Bradfield, some five km away. By about 1700 they counted themselves Dissenters.
By the year 1740 the original chapel had become unfit for use and Thomas Marriott of Ughill, a local Calvanistic dissenter, built the present day chapel on a nearby plot of land he had purchased for the purpose. The chapel was opened on 2 June 1743 by Mr. Wadsworth, Mr. Samuel Smith and three or four ministers, one of whom had come from Doncaster.
In 1785 the chapel embraced Unitarian beliefs when Reverend Edmund Gibson became minister. Many of the congregation could not accept Unitarianism and left the church, either returning to St. Nicholas or attending the newly opened Congregational church on Queen Street in the centre of Sheffield. In 1796 Underbank was visited by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who at that time was considering becoming a Unitarian minister; he met the chapel’s minister, the Reverend Astley Meanley.
Architecture.
Underbank Chapel is generally considered as being a distinctive and interesting example of its type as an eighteenth century Dissenters' meeting house. It was chosen as the cover photograph for "The Unitarian Heritage: An Architectural Survey of Chapels and Churches in the Unitarian Tradition in the British Isles". The book describes it as "an extremely sophisticated design" by an unknown person.
Exterior.
The chapel is constructed from coarse, squared sandstone with ashlar dressings. The roof is hipped and consists of stone slates with the flat central section being of lead. The front (south facing) side of the chapel features distinctive windows: two very tall round-headed ones with multiple small panes, and decoratively keyed oculus ones above both doors. The chapel originally had separate entrance doors for men and women, and although both are still "in situ", only the right hand one is now used.
Interior.
The north wall features two stained glass windows, one of which depicts St. Mark as the winged lion and Saint Matthew as a winged man. The other depictsJesus welcoming the children.
The interior of the chapel has undergone several major changes over the years. It now seats approximately 110 people downstairs, plus 50 to 70 in the gallery. It added fixed pews in 1860. It used to have two long side balconies, necessary to accommodate the large numbers attending the services. These were removed, and now only the balcony on the east wall at the back of the chapel remains. In 1952 there was a major refurbishment, which saw the addition of a vestry by removing two rows of pews and adding panelling. At the same time the pulpit was moved into a more central location, exchanging positions with the organ, which is now situated in the north-western corner. The organ itself is a Brindley & Foster pipe organ which was purchased second-hand in memorial of chapel members lost in World War I.
By the pulpit on the west wall is a wall hanging made by congregation members which commemorates the 350th anniversary of the founding of the original chapel in 2002.
Underbank Schoolroom.
Underbank Schoolroom stands 50 metres to the south-west of the chapel, at the junction of Stannington Road, Riggs Low Road and Stopes Road.
History.
The original school building was established in similar circumstances to the chapel when Richard Spoone, a local landowner, left a property called Sim House in his will dated 23 May 1652, to provide "“for the education of poor children whose parents are willing but unable to keep them in school”". Ralph Wood, the minister of the chapel, was the first schoolmaster, paid seventeen shillings and sixpence a quarter. In February 1844 George Revitt, aged 21, was appointed master by the trustees, being paid an annual salary of £20. He remained master for 31 years, and under him the school prospered. The trustees started to look for a site for a larger school; however in the end it was decided to demolish the old school and build the new one on the same site.
Construction of the new school was completed in 1853 and it opened on 8 May 1854. It cost between £500 and £600 to construct: the trustees contributed £100, as did the Sunday school, and there was a contribution from the Bingley House trust, but this left a considerable balance still to be repaid. It took 31 years to clear the debt, with a public subscriptions list being started which raised £270. The balance was finally paid in April 1885 by the proceeds of a bazaar at Channing Hall, linked to Upper Chapel in Sheffield.
In September 1910, the school was taken over by the County Council and it was announced that the school would close on 31 July 1911. The pupils were moved to the new and more centrally located Stannington Council School (Infants Department) with Underbank’s headmistress Mrs. Payne becoming head of the new school.
Architecture.
The building is constructed from rock faced gritstone with a Welsh slate roof. It consists of a single storey with a basement; the windows are tall, round headed with multiple small panes. A central plaque on the upper outer east wall reads: "“Day and Sunday School erected A.D. 1853.”"

Charles Ross (1667–1732)

Charles Ross or Rosse (8 February 1667 – 5 August 1732) was a Scottish soldier and Member of Parliament.
He was the second son of George Ross, 11th Lord Ross. When Wynne's Regiment of Dragoons was raised in 1689, Ross joined as a captain, and served with the regiment in the Williamite War in Ireland. He went to Flanders with the regiment as lieutenant-colonel in 1694, and was appointed colonel of the regiment on Wynne's death, 15 July 1695. In 1704 he secured the title of the Royal Dragoons of Ireland for his regiment.
Ross was promoted brigadier-general on 9 March 1702, and major-general on 1 January. He commanded a brigade of Dragoons at the battles of Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet. He was further promoted to lieutenant-general on 1 January 1707, made Colonel-General of all the Dragoon Forces on 1 May 1711, and promoted to full general on 1 January 1712. He was removed from the colonelcy of the Royal Irish Dragoons on 8 October 1715, but reappointed on 1 February 1729, holding the post until his death.
General Ross was Member of Parliament for Ross-shire from 1710 to 1722 and from 1727 to 1732. In September 1713 he was appointed Envoy Extraordinary to France, but did not take up the post. He died at Bath and was buried at Fearn Abbey, leaving his estate of Balnagown to his nephew Charles Ross.

<doc id="36569248" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36569248" title="Murashu family">
Murashu family

The house of Murashu (the house of the wild cats) was a family discovered in archaeological findings dating to the late 19th century. The family was alive during the 5th century of Sumer participating in early economic activities predominantly within the settlement Nippur. Also Murašû both meaning "wild cat", the name is transliterated as mršw originally as cuneiform script. The house is named after the head of the family.
Evidence of archaeology.
A large proportion of archaeological evidence on the family is from a house in Nippur, found within the remains of a twenty by ten foot room of the building. It was initially found during 1893 within the third expedition of the University of Pennsylvania at the site, at the time directed by JH Haynes. Known as the Murashu archive, these consist of clay tablets—879 in total (numbering 879 during 2005 "Provan,Long,Longman; "835 during 2001"Greenfield, Paul, Stone, Pinnick;" 800 during 1999 "Mieroop; "and 650 during 1995 in "Schramm") written in the languages Aramaic and Akkadian. The archive includes 657 different seal types (Bregstein).
Murashu tablets.
The Murashu tablets provide a glimpse into what life was like for fifth century Jewish descendants of the Babylonian Exile and captivity. After the Persian king Cyrus the Great captured Babylon in 583 BCE, he soon allowed and helped finance the return of Jews to Judea. The Murashu tablets are dated to this period after Jews were allowed to return to Judea. The fact that the banking house "Murashu & Sons" conducted business with Jews who decided to remain in Nippur rather than return to Judea suggests that life in Persian-controlled Nippur was at least somewhat tolerable for Jews.
The tablets discuss one such Jew, Udarna, son of Rahim-ili. Some of Udarna's property was stolen by his brother and nephew. To see that he might reacquire his property, Udarna brought his complaint to Bel-nadin-shumu, one of the sons of "Murashu & Sons." Udarna did have his property returned. In addition, no charges were brought against his brother or nephew. They also agreed that no offspring of Udarna would ever bring charges against Udarna's brother or nephew or their offspring. This act of forbidding any suit being brought against Udarna's brother and nephew or the generations after, was seemingly implemented to prevent a blood feud that might last generations.
Banking.
HV Hilprecht considers the group ("firm") to be bankers and brokers, who were engaged in money-lending and trading operations in southern and central Babylonia for a period of 50 years from the end of the 5th century (Dandamaev, Lukonin,Kohl). 
Three generations of the family are attested to in the Nippur documents. The archives ("legal" documentation) include matters concerning the less wealthy of Nippur living in the outer areas of the city, although also the interests of both royalty (the renting of fields - "Dandamaev, Lukonin, Kohl") and those associated with these, participating as officials within their estate. The artifacts are dated to the time of the reign of the kings Artaxerxes I and Darius II, (otherwise dated 465, 464 or 455 to 404 or 403 BCE). 
The core activity of the family was fief and estate land management, with members primarily active as creditors for workers of agricultural enterprises, in the lending and provision of equipment,seed, tools, irrigation and animals for this purpose, to individuals including Jewish persons, these relevant as to the book of Ezekiel. The archive gives information on interaction and agreement and the like with 100 jewish families. The family employed more than 60 agents. The house leased plots of land owned by civil servants (23 high court officials) and warriors (bow-lands, horse-lands and chariot lands) transferring rental payments and also subsequent taxes to the royal family. The government used the family for the purposes of the collection of tax on land (harāka ]) (the family "farmed out" taxes). The family had dealings with 2500 separate individuals, at least as evidenced by the archive document when Schniedewind states this includes in total an "...onomasticon of some 2500 names...".
The family had no role in foreign exchange (international trade). Although members did travel to Susa (in Elam, about 200 kilometres distance) where they remained for months involved in financial businesses.

G. Michael Bancroft

G. Michael "Mike" Bancroft, FRSC, (born 1942) is a Canadian chemist and emeritus professor at the University of Western Ontario. One of the world's leading experts in Mössbauer spectroscopy, he is also known as one of the driving forces behind the development of synchrotron science in Canada, becoming the first director of the Canadian Light Source synchrotron after a 30 year "Odyssey".
Early life and education.
Bancroft was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, the son of an accountant, but grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba where he attended Kelvin High School. 
He graduated from the University of Manitoba in 1963, subsequently earning an MSc in chemistry (1964) from the same institution. Later that year he went to the University of Cambridge, England to study for a PhD. He worked under the supervision of A.G. Maddock on the development of Mössbauer spectroscopy, obtaining his PhD in 1967. Over a 20 year period Bancroft would become one of the world's leading experts in Mössbauer spectroscopy, publishing more than 80 papers, a major review and an authoritative textbook in the field.
University of Western Ontario.
After working as a postdoc at the University of Manitoba, Bancroft returned to Cambridge as a Fellow at Christ's College.
Bancroft returned to Canada in 1970, as an Assistant Professor in the department of chemistry at the University of Western Ontario (UWO), becoming a Professor in 1974, spending two periods as Head of Department. Bancroft was director of the Centre for Chemical Physics from 1977 to 1981, establishing Surface Science Western during his tenure. At UWO Bancroft became interested in photoemission spectroscopy, and in 1972, with National Research Council (NRC) support, a spectrometer was purchased for research using far ultraviolet and X-ray photons. This purchase also involved the Universities of Toronto and Windsor in a Southwestern Ontario consortium.
Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility.
In 1972 Bancroft took part in a workshop organised by Bill McGowan of (UWO) on the uses of synchrotron radiation, an event he has described "the beginning of my 30 year odyssey to develop Canadian synchrotron capabilities in the US and then in Canada". He began work at the Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA in 1975, as a result of contact established with then-SRC director Ed Rowe at the 1972 meeting. After several failed attempts were made to establish a synchrotron facility in Canada, Bancroft submitted a proposal to the NRC to build a Canadian beamline at SRC. In 1978 the newly created NSERC awarded capital funding, and the Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility (CSRF) was founded. CSRF, owned and operated by NRC, with Bancroft as Scientific Director, grew from the initial beamline to a total of three by 1998.
Canadian Light Source.
The push for a synchrotron lightsource in Canada gained impetus in the early 1990s with the formation of the Canadian Institute for Synchrotron Radiation (CISR) with Bancroft as President. In 1994 NSERC recommended building a Canadian synchrotron, and set up a committee to decide between two rival bids to host the facility, led by Dennis Skopik of the University of Saskatchewan and Bancroft of UWO. In 1996 the committee recommend that the Canadian Light Source (CLS) be built in Saskatoon.
With the formation of the Canada Foundation for Innovation a funding mechanism for the lightsource became available, and after what Bancroft has described as a "Herculean" effort by the Saskatchewan team the funding was finalised in 1999. At this point Skopik departed to the USA, and Bancroft was appointed as the first director of the CLS. 
Bancroft's appointment ended in 2001, although he remained as Research Director until 2004, and he returned to UWO. Bancroft's association with the CLS continues, and he currently serves on their Board of Directors.
Awards and honours.
Bancroft was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (RSC) in 1979 (at the age of 37), and was inducted into the Order of Canada in 2003.
He was awarded the RSC's Rutherford Memorial Medal in 1980, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1982/3, and the CIC and Montreal medals of the Chemical Institute of Canada in 1996 and 2002 respectively. The Canadian Light Source annual award for best PhD thesis is named for Bancroft.

Plot summary.
Tired of supporting his freeloading nephew, Max's uncle arranges an introduction between Max and an old friend who has a farm and two unmarried daughters. Max's uncle suggests the eldest daughter as a good match, but she fears that Max will be more interested in her younger sister. So, it is arranged that during Max's visit, the younger daughter would be disguised as the maid. Unfortunately, Max is immediately taken by the maid. As a distraction, a tour of the farm is suggested, during which Max takes every opportunity to sneak away to see the maid as she performs chores such as milking the cow. Max gets separated in an attempt to hide his attentions to the maid from the father and ultimately finds his way back to the main house where he finds the maid on the father's lap. Max reacts with outrage, and the father reveals the deception. With everything cleared up, Max proposes to the youngest daughter and she and the father accept. At this point, the eldest daughter rejoins the group and is angry to learn that despite her precautions, her fears were realized after all. Max entreats her for forgiveness and she relents. 
Release.
"Une idylle à la ferme" premiered on 14 June 1912 in Vienna and 20 December 1912 in the US.

Coal Bluff Campground and Park

Coal Bluff Campground and Park is a semi-private campground and recreation area located along the Pearl River in Scott County, Mississippi, near the community of Ludlow. The area is managed by Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD).
History.
The name "Coal Bluff" comes from the mineral lignite, or "brown coal", commonly found in the area.
Recreation.
Camping.
The campground accommodates both primitive and R.V. campers for a nightly or monthly fee that includes graded and cement camping pads with utility hook-ups for electricity, water and sewer. Campground amenities include bath houses, a playground, and a swimming pool. A pavilion overlooking the river is available to rent for large gatherings.
Nature viewing.
A nature trail along the river offers viewing of native plant and animal species, including bald cypress swamp forests, American alligators, numerous water fowl, and the endangered ringed sawback turtle.
Water sports.
The park adjacent to the campground offers a free public boat launch into the river and a managed fishing pond. All manners of water craft can be found on the river, including motorboats, jet skis, canoes and kayaks. Large sandbars along the riverbanks are popular gathering places for boaters to swim and sunbath.
Rules and regulations.
The campground has set rules for visitors posted on-site and on-line, including speed limits, quiet hours, vehicle restrictions, etc. A 24-hour security guard patrols the campground and park. Parking restrictions at the public boat launch are enforced by the Reservoir Police. The municipality in which the park and campground are located, as well as the corresponding section of river, is designated as being within a dry county, meaning that possession of alcohol intended for consumption is illegal. Anyone caught littering can face a steep fine. Dumpsters and trash pickup are offered in both the park and campground. Trash service has been discontinued along the river, so people using the sandbars are expected to "pack-out" their own trash or face a fine for littering. Reservoir Police regularly patrol the area, both on land and by boat.

Parkview Grade Schools

Parkview School District currently operates 2 grade schools. They are Parkview Elementary School and Parkview Primary School. Parkview Elementary School is the biggest, and houses the district's 3-6th graders. Parkview Primary School educates the district's Pre-K through 2nd graders. All PPS kids go to PES for 3rd through 6th grades. All kids in the two schools go to Parkview Jr./Sr. High School for middle school and high school.
Consolidation.
Through 2012, Parkview operated three elementary schools. However, at a time when budgets were being cut, the school board had to close an elementary school. The first plan was to close both Footville and Newark Elementary Schools and add modular classrooms at Orfordville. However, the plan was disputed and eventually changed. Newark Elementary was closed at the end of the 2011-2012 school year. Footville was to be closed later. The names of Orfordville and Footville Elementary Schools were changed to Parkview Elementary and Parkview Primary, respectively. In 2013, the school board drew up plans for a $17 million referendum creating a new high school and moving all elementary kids to the old high school. After a huge effort to pass the referendum, it passed by 26 votes on April 1, 2014. Currently, the new schools are expected to open for the 2015-2016 school year. At that time, Parkview Primary School will close.

Andor Gomme

Austin Harvey Gomme "known as" Andor Gomme (7 May 1930 – 19 September 2008) was a British scholar of English literature and architectural history. He read Moral Sciences at Cambridge University in the 1950s, and became a lecturer in English literature at Keele University in 1963. Keele University appointed him Professor of English Literature and Architectural History in 1984, and Emeritus Professor in 1995.
Gomme was a frequent reviewer for the "Times Literary Supplement", an author of books on both literary criticism and architectural history, and Chair of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain, whose journal, "Architectural History", he edited for many years.
Life and career.
Andor was the son of Arnold Wycombe Gomme, a British classical scholar and Professor of Ancient History at the University of Glasgow and Phyllis Kate Harvey. The first name Andor was originally a nickname, and began as a family joke for the unborn baby (or babies) of unknown sex. He studied at Clare College, Cambridge, where he was taught by F.R. Leavis and attained a First Class Honours degree in Moral Sciences. He was appointed to a three-year fellowship at Gonville and Caius College in 1956.
In 1960, he married fellow scholar Susan Koechlin, with whom he had one son and three daughters. The couple settled at Barleybat Hall, Church Lawton, Cheshire, after Andor obtained a permanent position at Keele University in 1963; he had previously worked in the Extra-Mural Department at the University of Glasgow, and at the University of Montana. At Keele, he was promoted from Lecturer to Senior Lecturer and Reader, achieving the title of Professor of English Literature and Architectural History in 1984 - a chair created to reflect his unique range of interests.
He was a regular front-page and anonymous reviewer for the "Times Literary Supplement", and wrote several books on literary criticism and architectural history. His first book, "Attitudes to criticism", has been described as "a critical celebration of the very similar sensibilities and minds of Leavis and the American Yvor Winters", while his last book, "Design and plan in the country house" (with co-author Alison Maguire), has been praised by Professor Tim Mowl as a "remarkable scholarly resource" despite its "ambitious range".
For many years, Gomme was editor of "Architectural History", the flagship journal of the Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain of which he was Chair from 1988 to 1991. He died in Church Lawton on 19 September 2008. The author of his obituary, Emeritus Professor of Cultural Studies Fred Inglis, described Gomme as "one of the best British architectural historians since John Ruskin".
Gomme had a long-standing interest in choral music, and he edited a 1997 reconstruction of J.S. Bach's "St Mark Passion" which was published by Bärenreiter. The recitatives and turba choruses are drawn from Reinhard Keiser's (1674–1739) "St Mark Passion", which Bach himself had adapted for use in Weimar in 1713 (and which influenced Bach's own "St Matthew Passion".) Gomme was the first to utilise Keiser's recitatives, and he paved the way for fuller reconstructions by other scholars. Gomme's reconstruction was recorded in 1998 for ASV Records by the Choir of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge and the Cambridge Baroque Camerata, directed by Geoffrey Webber.

Valiant-class tugboat

The "Valiant" class is a class of US Navy yard tugboats that entered service in 2009. These tugs are designed to provide ship assist, barge and general towing, and escort services.
Design.
Before committing to a new tug design, Navy Region Northwest upgraded two of the older s, and , with improved power systems and z-drive propulsion units. Experience with these and two other YTBs with improved winch and power equipment lead to the decision to build new tugs.
The "Valiant" class was designed by Robert Allan Ltd. and derived from their "Z-Tech 6000" commercial tugboat design. The prime contractor for the first four class members was Pacific Tugboat Services of Long Beach, California. The builder was J.M. Martinac Shipbuilding Corp. of Tacoma, Washington. 
Unlike previous classes of navy tugboats, the "Valiant" class employs z-drive propulsion units manufactured by Schottel. These SRP 1012 drive units can be turned through 360 degrees to provide thrust in any direction. The z-drive propulsion and the unique hull shape allow this class of tug to have roughly the same bollard pull ratings ahead, , as astern, . The z-drive propulsion units are powered by Caterpillar Marine 3512C V12 diesel engines.
For towing, "Valiant"-class tugs are able to run stern-first using the JonRie InterTech hydraulic bow winch. This "tractor" mode of operation is accommodated with a stern profile that is higher than the bow profile.
An electric powered tug is being considered as a way for the Navy to reach its 2020 fossil fuel reduction goals.
"Valiant"-class tugs have an extendable, pivoting brow for use when personnel transfers are required. There are four state rooms, 2 singles for the chief engineer and the tug master, and two doubles for the other crew members. There is also a galley and mess area. The deck house is well insulated to reduce vibration and sound levels in the accommodations areas. The pilot house is windowed all around.

Starfarers (book)

Starfarers is a 1998 science fiction novel by Poul Anderson .
Plot.
Earth sends out a spaceship to investigate starfaring in far distances of which traces have been found. The ship ENVOY manned by a crew of six men and four women travels at speed close to the speed of light. At the end of the journey the crew meets a Centaur-like species on a planet they call TAHIR that has left spacefaring behind. Arousing interests the earthlings can send a combined crew to a nearby black hole where sentient life has been detected and also confirmed by the "Tahirans".
Communications with this "Holont" is established and much knowledge acquired. Differences aboard the ship lead to the death of three men (Brent, Russek and Cleland). Female pilot Kilbirnie crashes into the black hole. The six earthlings left drop the Tahirans off at their homeworld and head towards Earth.
In between the story jumps regularly back to the development of human society over the gaps of many thousand years and to the Kith who are the closed group doing the starfaring and often are shunned by the rest of Earth. The Kith have their settlements on different planets where some retire to from time to time.
Earth has changed in this large period of time and no one is much interested in spacefaring anymore. On a colony of Earth, Harbor, they find remainders of the Kith-Society, which still are connected to spacefaring. But the last ship to plot trade-routes in space, Fleetwing, disappears from tracking. The cause is a Zero-Zero-failure ripping off the rear part of the ship. ENVOY sets out on a rescue mission as soon as possible but twenty years of outside time have passed by the time they reach Fleetwing. They can save the remaining crew - thus having a foundation of experienced spacefarers to start spacefaring anew with the knowledge acquired from the Holont.

<doc id="36569717" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36569717" title="Šandabakku">
Šandabakku

The office of šandabakku, inscribed (LÚGÚ.EN.NA) or sometimes as (GÁ.DUB.BA.A EN.LÍLKI), the latter designation perhaps meaning "archivist of (the god) Enlil," was the name of the position of governor of the Mesopotamian city of Nippur from the Kassite period (mid second millennium BC) onward. Enlil, as the tutelary deity of Nippur, had been elevated in prominence and was shown special veneration by the Kassite monarchs, it being the most common theophoric element in their names. This caused the position of the "šandabakku" to become very prestigious and the holders of the office seem to have wielded influence second only to the king.
The office.
The term "šandabakku" first appears in texts from Mari, where it seems to represent a high-ranking administrative official, but it is not until the Kassite period that it became synonymous with the city of Nippur. Nippur had been depopulated sometime towards the end of the reign of Samsu-iluna (ca. 1686–1648 BC, short chronology) and remained abandoned until the end of the fifteenth century when the Kassites began a program of restoration of cultic centers. The earliest inscriptions of this restoration belong to Kurigalzu I.
The office may be related in some manner to that of the "nišakku" (, LÚNU.ÈŠ) of Enlil, probably the senior priestly or dignitary position of the Ekur. Whether the post was held concurrently with that of the "šandabakku" or at some, perhaps, earlier stage in the career of the prospective governor has yet to be determined but it is clear that Enlil-kidinni and his immediate successors all held both offices and Amil-Marduk and Enlil-šuma-imbī were similarly honored. Only during the reign of Nazi-Maruttaš, were they held by separate individuals, with Nūr-Delebat and his son Ninurta-rēṣušu assuming the "nišakku"-priest position, the latter of whom naming Enlil-kidinni’s father Enlil-bānī and Amīlatum as ancestors, on his clay quadrangular prism, a votive dedication to the storm-god Adad.
The most prominent of the "šandabakku" officials were Enlil-kidinni, who corresponded and exchanged gifts with the Assyrian crown prince Enlil-nirari, if his name has been correctly restored, and Amil-Marduk around a hundred years later, under whose rule Nippur experienced significant restoration work undertaken by servile laborers whose purchase documents and ration lists make up much of the so-called “governor's library.” In the later Achaemenid period, from the reign of Xerxes I the title was replaced by that of the "paqdu".

Beyond Outrage

Plot summary.
The film begins with two anti-corruption detectives observing the discovery of dead human bodies in a car being recovered from the bottom of a harbor. The detectives suspect that the drowned bodies are related to the recent gang war and power struggle at the huge Sanno-kai crime syndicate which covers a large portion of eastern Japan. The new Grand Yakuza leader of Sanno-kai, Kato, must now reform his standing with the powerful rival Hanabishi-kai crime syndicate of western Japan. Otomo (Beat Takeshi), a former Yakuza, is serving time in a maximum security prison after falling out of favor with Sekiuchi, the former Grand Yakuza before Kato took control.
When it is finally ascertained by detectives that one of the dead bodies recovered from the harbor in the opening scene was actually the body of a high government official, the departmental Chief of Police strongly suspects that the new Grand Yakuza leader of the Sanno-Kai syndicate, Kato (Tomokazu Miura), has become too strong and influential. He suspects that Kato now believes that he is sufficiently protected by his corrupt political ties that he can completely avoid being investigated even after ordering the execution of a government official.
The Chief of Police then appoints special detective Kataoka, who has previously infiltrated the Sanno-kai syndicate by posing as a corrupt cop open to accepting bribes for favors, to see if he can ignite further dissent between the already aggressive Sanno-kai Yakuza leaders. Detective Kataoka decides that if he could somehow speed-up the release process of Otomo from his prison sentence, then Otomo’s returning presence at the Sanno-kai syndicate might stir-up bad memories of old bitter clan rivalries which prevailed before Otoma was sent to the penitentiary. This would potentially cause old cracks to resurface in this new and growing version of the old Sanno-kai crime syndicate.
When Kataoka uses his influence to shorten Otomo's imprisonment and Otomo is released from the peneteniary, Kato allows his lieutenant to issue orders to kill him. Otomo, with careful calculation and help from the rival Hanabishi-kai crime syndicate of western Japan, uses his new allies to initiate a ruthless and bloody rampage through the ranks of the Sanno-kai crime syndicate in order to seize his version of justice for having been previously betrayed and forced to serve his now ended prison sentence.
Otomo's careful calculation pays off as his ruthless campaign to disembowel the new Sanno-kai Yakusa leadership, including Kato, is efficiently put into full operation. The decimated Sanno-kai crime syndicate then ends up being taken over and absorbed by the now vast Hanabishi-kai crime syndicate under their Grand Yakuza leader who has virtually unified the entire underground of all of Japan into a massive, single and centralized crime syndicate.
In the closing scene, Otomo returns to a funeral home at nightfall where some of his killed Yakuza brothers are being interred. He is surprised in the parking lot on the way there by Detective Kataoka who tells him that all the Yakuza leaders are inside at the funeral home and that he better make sure he has a gun before he goes inside. When he learns that Otomo is unarmed, detective Kataoka, still posing as a corrupt detective on the take, offers to give Otomo his own gun for Otomo's self-protection. By now it has fully dawned upon Otomo that Kataoka has been playing the two rival crime syndicates against each other in order to weaken and destroy the Sanno-kai syndicate, although detective Kataoka does not realize, then and there, that Otomo has seen through all of his plotting. The moment Kataoka hands his loaded gun to Otomo for Otomo’s self-protection, Otomo immediately cocks the gun in the nearly empty parking lot, aims it at point blank range directly at Kataoka, and empties the full magazine into Kataoka killing him instantly as the film ends.
Release.
"Beyond Outrage" was screened in competition at the 69th Venice International Film Festival.
Soundtrack.
Kitano returned to Keiichi Suzuki, the same Japanese composer he had used for the original "Outrage" film, for the complete sequel soundtrack, and previously Kitano had colloborated with him for the complete soundtrack to his "Zatoichi" film. This complete soundtrack for "Beyond Outrage" was their third film collaboration.
Reception.
Gabe Toro of "IndieWire" gave "Beyond Outrage" an "A-" rating. Justin Chang of "Variety" described the film as "a slow-motion deathtrap in which the wall-to-wall chatter feels like a joyless, too-leisurely distraction from the inevitable bloodletting". Meanwhile, he commented that Otomo (Beat Takeshi) is "the most memorable figure here, a demon of death shown to brook no nonsense in the film's blunt, perfect final scene". Lee Marshall of "Screen International" said, "Out-and-out shouting matches between supposedly composed clan members are another forte of "Outrage Beyond" – a film that always has humour bubbling just underneath its hard-boiled surface".
"Kinema Junpo" placed "Beyond Outrage" at number 3 in their "10 Best Japanese Films of 2012", while it was ranked at number 36 on the "Film Comment"'s "50 Best Undistributed Films of 2012".
Sequel.
In September 2012, Takeshi Kitano said that the producers wanted him to make the third "Outrage" film. As reported by Macnab, the making of a third "Outrage" film would complete the first film trilogy for Takeshi Kitano. As of 30 June 2013, Box Office Mojo reported a total revenue for "Outrage" approaching USD ten million with USD 8,383,891 in the total worldwide lifetime box office. As of 28 July 2013, "Beyond Outrage" had receipts more than twice as high, at USD 16,995,152.

Ahot Ketannah

The Ahot Ketannah ("Little Sister", "אחות קטנה") is a pizmon of eight stanzas sung in the Sephardic ritual before the commencement of the Rosh Hashanah evening prayer.
The refrain runs "May the year end with her woes!" and is changed in the last stanza to "May the year begin with her blessings!" The poem symbolizes Israel by a little sister, who must suffer greatly yet remains faithful to her heavenly lover. The author, Abraham Ḥazan, a cantor born in Thessaloniki in 1533, probably also composed the melody, which is in the hypodorian mode. His name appears in acrostic form in the poem.
The melody has points of similarity to contemporary airs from the Greek archipelago.

She is a friend and partner of the second Flash (before "Flashpoint"), Barry Allen. She first appeared in "Five-Star Super-Hero Spectacular" ("DC Special Series" #1) (September 1977).
History.
Patty Spivot was the part-time lab assistant to police scientist Barry Allen for the Central City Police Department. One day, she was nearly bathed in experimental chemicals when lightning struck the crime lab. However, Barry whisked her to safety at superspeed. During the incident, Barry had a brief daydream about what would have happened had he not been there. In it, Patty gained superspeed and adopted the identity Ms. Flash. However, her speed had disastrous side effects, resulting in the destruction of Central City.
In those days, Patty harbored romantic feelings towards Barry, However, she knew of Barry's obsession with his mother's unsolved case, so she decided to keep her distance until Barry was ready to move on with his life. However, when Barry became more open, he fell in love with Iris West, who would later become his wife. Therefore, she decided to remain just friends with him.
She later became the police department's full-time forensic blood analyst.
After David Singh took over the crime lab as director and began to emphasize the quantity of the cases solved over the quality, Patty decided to leave Central City for Blue Valley, Nebraska.
Barry attempted to contact Patty to get help on the case of Elongated Kid's death. She was visiting her mother in Keystone City at the time, so she went to the police lab to meet him. She told him that she was enjoying her new life in Blue Valley. Wanting to put the past behind her, she asked not to get involved. However, Barry received a call to another crime scene, and he convinced her to join him. Here, they found a young boy hiding in a shipping container. They brought the boy to the police station to interview as a witness, but he refused to open up to anyone but Patty. However, shortly thereafter, the boy revealed himself to her as Professor Zoom, the Reverse-Flash. It was he who had been responsible for the deaths of Elongated Kid and others, and he threatened to kill Patty in the same way, by accelerating her aging process until she died of old age within seconds. However, Flash, Kid Flash, and Hot Pursuit arrived on the scene just in time, saving Patty.
Later, Barry went to the police station to see if Patty was okay. Patty revealed to Barry that she planned to return to Blue Valley, but Barry tried to convince her to stay. Then, Patty revealed to Barry about her unrequited crush on him. Surprised by this, Barry tells her that he will always be her friend and asks her to think about staying in Central City, and Patty promises she will. But in that moment, Iris comes in, and Patty, trying to avoid an awkward moment, leaves.
Flashpoint.
Patty, wanting to do something bigger with her life, stole the former Hot Pursuit's gear from Central City Police Department evidence locker, becoming became the new Hot Pursuit.
Escaping from a group of cops in her Cosmic Motorcycle, Patty went to a rooftop. Suddenly, her bike detects a timestorm and initiates an emergency chronal-evac, transporting her to the year 3011.
There, she was captured by Brainiac's forces and placed in an hibernation chamber, where she was forced to relive her worst memory: drowning to death for a few minutes in a pool when she was a kid. However, she managed to escape.
Later, she helps Kid Flash escape from Brainiac, Earth's ruler in the 3011. After they get to safety, Patty reveals her identity to him and explains that they are in the 31st century. Kid Flash tells her that he was born in the 31st century and it is nothing like the 31st century he was born in, so something must have changed in the timeline. Patty tells her that her bike can travel through time but only if it has the Speed Force tank, so Kid Flash agrees to find it. Kid Flash tells her that they must get back to the past and fix the timeline. Then, Kid Flash takes off his glove and shows that his right hand has lost its skin and it only has muscles and bone.
Patty reveals to Bart about how she became Hot Pursuit. Bart takes Patty's helmet and uses it to see how much was the timeline changed. Suddenly, the two are attacked by Brainiac's probes, but they escape using the Cosmic Motorcycle. Hiding in an abandoned building, they decide to enter Brainiac's fortress to obtain the Speed Force tank.
Bart lets himself be captured by Brainiac, who places him in a chamber. Inside the virtual reality, Bart manages to rewrite several of Braniac's programs, including his security systems. This allows Patty enter the citadel and rescue Kid Flash. They manage to find the Speed Force tank, but Brainiac impales Patty in the chest with his claws. Enraged, Bart attacks him while Patty obtains the tank. Using her last moments, Patty smashes the tank in front of Bart, allowing him to regain his speed. Patty dies and her body is taken by Brainiac. Bart escapes to the past, promising to save her.
The New 52.
Flash managed to change reality and create a new universe, bringing Patty back to life. In this new reality, Patty is in a relationship with Barry, who never married Iris.

Murder 3

Murder 3 is an Indian film and the sequel to the 2011 film, "Murder 2". Directed by Vishesh Bhatt and produced by Mukesh Bhatt from Vishesh Films. This is the third instalment in the "Murder film series" and is an official Bollywood remake of the Colombian thriller "The Hidden Face". "Murder 3" was released on 15 February 2013 to mixed reviews. The film performed moderately well at the box office. 
Story.
The film opens with Vikram (Randeep Hooda), a hot-shot fashion and wildlife photographer, viewing a video of his girlfriend, Roshni (Aditi Rao Hydari) telling him she is leaving him. Vikram becomes distraught. While drinking away his sorrows at a bar, he meets Nisha (Sara Loren) and they had a relationship where Nisha moves into the house that Vikram was sharing with Roshni. Vikram becomes a suspect in the disappearance of Roshni, however, the investigators can find no evidence of Vikram's involvement in Roshni's disappearance.
It is revealed that the house is owned by a German lady who shows Roshni a secret room built to hide her husband just in case someone came to look for him because he was in British Army at the time of 1947. The room is self-contained and sealed off from sound.
In a flashback, it is also shown that Roshni, jealous of Vikram's relationship with one of his colleague, decided to pretend she is leaving him. She creates the video saying she is leaving as she hides in the secret room. The room has some one way mirrors where she can observe Vikram's reaction. When she decides he has had enough she looks for the key and realizes she lost the key and is now trapped in the room with no way to contact him.
Nisha finds the key to the secret room, but she doesn't know what it is used for. Nisha eventually figures out that Roshni is trapped in the house because Roshni is able to communicate through tapping on the pipes in the secret room. As Nisha is ready to open the door, she pauses and decides not to rescue Roshni because she might lose Vikram after that. Nisha struggles with her decision, but decides to open the door and check on Roshni because the investigators gave Nisha pictures of Vikram and his Colleague and she herself feels the pangs of jealousy. As Nisha is checking on Roshni laying in a bed in the secret room, Roshni surprises Nisha and knocks her out with a glass bottle and leaves Nisha locked in the room. After Roshni comes out of the secret room, she sees Vikram and his colleagues photographs and shatters. She decides to leave the house. She leaves that picture of Vikram with his colleague on mirror and also sticks her necklace to show Vikram that she is out and then she sends the keys of the room to the investigator who actually loves Nisha. The investigator comes and arrests Vikram. The final scene shows Roshni tearing her and Vikram's photograph and is going on a highway road in a car alone, happy on leaving the devastated and arrested Vikram.
Casting.
The makers of the film, who also worked on "Murder" and "Murder 2" decided that Emraan Hashmi would not be returning for the third movie and that Randeep Hooda would play the leading role. Names like Asin Thottumkal and Esha Gupta were announced for the female lead but, Asin was not happy with script then the role went to Esha Gupta. After initial talks with Esha Gupta fell through, Aditi Rao Hydari was finally cast as the female lead. Pakistani actress Mona Lizza was then chosen as the second female lead, as the film is a one hero, two heroine project.
Production and development.
Shooting of the film has happened in Cape Town, South Africa and Goa, India.
Mahesh Bhatt said ""Murder 3" is the 2013 equivalent of the controversial film, Arth in the thriller genre which released in 1983. Then it was the institution of marriage that was deconstructed and 30 years later Murder 3 deconstructs love and questions its very existence in today's world of relationship crimes. Now that we have the official rights of the film ("The Hidden Face"), we look to doing it justice and taking the Murder franchise forward."
Critical reception.
"Murder 3" received mixed reviews from critics.
Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave it 4 out of 5 and stated that Murder 3 "is one of the finest thrillers to come out of Vishesh Films. An outstanding story narrated with ferocious enthusiasm. Vishesh Bhatt hits a boundary in his very first attempt!" Madhureeta Mukherjee of The Times Of India gave it 3 out of 5, while commenting 'This one's no bloody Valentine, but watch it if you like it twisted.' Komal Nahta wrote, 'On the whole, Murder 3 is a fair entertainer'.Nabanita of OneIndia also gave it 3 out of 5 while commenting that it has thrills but it fails to captivate. Roshni Devi of Koimoi gave it 2.5 out of 5, saying that it is worth a watch. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 2.5/5 stars and stated 'Murder 3, a thriller that vacillates between the taut to the toxic, packs enough punch and panache to keep the audience glued, if not sweep them off their feet. It tweaks the formula just a tad – it goes somewhat easy on the erotic component of the Murder franchise, opts for a markedly stronger emotional spine, and gives the female characters more than usual space.'
Anupama Chopra gave it 2/5 while writing that 'With a little more imagination, Murder 3 could have been deliciously dark'. Sukanya Verma for Rediff.com has given 2/5 stars and says "Murder 3" has some badly-acted thrills.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of the film is composed by Pritam, Anupam Amod & Roxen Band. The lyrics are penned by Sayeed Quadri. The soundtrack was released on 2 Feb 2013. The songs were immensely popular specially the songs "Teri Jhuki Nazar" & "Hum Jee Lenge was immensely popular among the masses while the other decent tracks like Mat Azma Re & Jaata Hai Tujh Tak were also very popular gaining good critical review & mass appeal.

Jacopo Guarana (October 28, 1720 – April 18, 1808) was an Italian painter of the late Baroque period, active mainly in Venice and its mainland territories.
He was born in Verona. In 1750, he completed frescoes for the interior of Ca' Rezzonico, and in 1780 for the church of San Tomà. He also painted for the church of San Teonisto in Treviso, the Villa Contarini in Cinto Euganeo. He also helped decorate Villa Pisani at Stra.

Guarana is the last remaining heir of the Tiepolesque tradition. He was a founding member of the Venetian Accademia di Belle Arti, and is said to have studied under the then elder Sebastiano Ricci, then with Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Among his most gratifying works is the wall frescoes at the concert hall of the Ospedaletto, Venice. By the time, he paints a "Sacred heart of Jesus and Saints" for the church of San Polo, his work would have been retardataire, a glimpse of a lapsing past.

Pentax 645

The Pentax 645 is a medium format single-lens reflex system camera manufactured by Pentax. It was introduced in 1984, along with a complementary line of lenses. It captures images nominally 6 cm × 4.5 cm on 120, 220, and 70 mm film, though the actual size of the images is 56 mm × 41.5 mm.
Models.
645.
The 645 is the original model introduced in 1984. It has a built-in 1.5 frames per second motor drive, center-weighted TTL metering, multiple automatic exposure modes, and a small LCD screen on the top plate which indicates mode, exposure compensation, and exposure count. Unlike comparable medium-format cameras, the 645 does not have an interchangeable back system. Instead, the film is loaded into holders, which are then inserted into the rear of the camera. The holders cannot be removed until an entire roll is shot. The crop factor vs. a 35 mm camera is .62.
645N.
In 1997, a significantly redesigned model was introduced. The 645N incorporated an auto-focus system, and most of the 645 lenses were upgraded to match. The new model also featured matrix metering, film-edge data imprinting, and a self-timer. The controls and LCD on the top plate were significantly changed, and the motor drive was increased to 2 frames per second.
645NII.
The 645NII is the latest model and was introduced in 2001. The main improvement was the addition of mirror lock-up.
645D.
The Pentax 645D is a digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in 2010. It is approximately the same size and shape as the earlier film models, and the lens mount accepts older manual and auto-focus lenses. It features a 40 megapixel CCD sensor manufactured by Kodak. The 7264×5440 pixel sensor measures 44 mm × 33 mm, which is less than 63% the size of a 6×4.5 cm film image but over 168% of a full-frame DSLR. Unlike other medium-format DSLRs, which accept digital camera backs of different resolutions or even manufacturers, the 645D has a fixed-back design similar to smaller full-frame and APS-C DSLRs. The fixed back allows the 645D to be fully weather-sealed. The crop factor vs. a 35 mm camera is 0.79.
645Z.
On the 5th of February 2014 Ricoh announced that they are going to exhibit a new model Pentax medium format digital at the CP+ 2014 Camera and Photo Imaging Show, tentatively titled the "645D 2014". Features announced include a "latest, super-high-resolution CMOS image sensor" and a "tilt-type LCD monitor". The camera is expected to be reach market in Spring 2014. In April 2014 the camera was announced as Pentax 645Z. It was sold out after the launch, as demand (1500 orders as of June 2014) exceeded supply (400 cameras per month), because of its relatively low price ($10,000) compared to other medium size cameras ($30,000). The Pentax 645Z uses a 51.4 megapixel CMOS sensor and a 27 point autofocus system with two SD card slots in a weather sealed body.
Lenses.
The "A" series manual focus lenses were released with the original 645, followed by the auto-focusing "FA" series for the 645N, and the "DFA" series for the 645D. The acronym "smc" stands for super multi-coated, a feature long found on higher-grade Pentax lens. "IF" indicates that the lenses are of an internal focusing design. Pentax 67 lenses can be used on the 645 series with an adapter. The Pentax 645 lens mount has a flange focal distance of 70.87mm.

Jens Hermansson Juel

Jens Hermansson Juel or Jens Juel (born January 8, 1580 at Refstrup, died March 26, 1634 at Bøvling) was a Danish nobleman who served as Governor-general of Norway from 1618 to 1629.
Early Years.
Juel attended the Sorø Academy from 1590 to 1596, and then had a seven-year educational trip with studies abroad, ending in 1603 when he became employed at the Danish chancery. He advanced quickly, being given major tasks: Danish Treasury (responsible for accounting, payment and collection of customs duties and taxes, as well as management of state property, including forests, roads and buildings) beginning in 1609, member of the Danish national council from 1616 and assignment to serve on several diplomatic missions.
Governor-general of Norway.
In 1618, he was named Governor-general of Norway which included the traditional role as feudal lord to Akershus in Norway. Juel proved to be an energetic and active governor, both on the Crown’s and on his own behalf. King Christian IV was occupied with the Thirty Years' War which left Juel with substantial latitude to apply his own judgment. He enacted a garrison tax in 1627, which financed the manning of fortresses at Akershus, Båhus, Bergen and Trondheim, and served as the foundation of an independent Norwegian defense organization, based on a strengthened peasant militia. A similar attempt at developing Norwegian naval strength was, however, rejected by the king.
AS feudal lord of Akershus Juel established the new city of Christiania when Oslo burnt in 1624. The new city was a relatively Danish-dominated city, serving as refuge for a network of immigrant merchants, especially from Haderslev, which was destroyed by war in 1627.
Juel actively expanded mining operations in Norway, and served as the first director of the Kongsberg Silver Mines. The Silver Works was originally a 100% state-owned enterprise, but financial difficulties resulting from the DanishNorwegian intervention in the Thirty Years' War, resulted in sale of shares to a private company in 1628, with the state as one of the part-owners. Juel was head of the private partnership that bought a share of the silver mine.
Juel was also active in husbanding his private wealth through lending while he served in Oslo, gaining ownership of a number of Norwegian estates, and also acquiring lands in Denmark.
Family.
His father was Herman Juel (1548–1607) and Maren Juel. He was married in Viborg, Denmark on May 13, 1610 Ide Lange (1584–1649), the daughter of Hans Lange (1542–1609) of Brejning and Johanne Skram (?-1620). Juel and Ide Hansdatter Lange had a daughter, Christence Juel, who was born on August 12, 1637. She married Jørgen Rosenkrantz (born 1607).

Amini Fonua

Amini Tuitavake Fonua (born 14 December 1989) is a Tongan swimmer.
Fonua was born and raised in Ponsonby, Auckland, New Zealand to Tongan lawyer Sione Fonua and British-born mother Julie. He holds dual Tongan and New Zealand citizenship. His family includes two other sisters.
Fonua's swimming career began at the Roskill Swimming Club based at Cameron Pool in Auckland, coached by Sandra Burrow from 1999-2007. He broke numerous Auckland and New Zealand Age Group Records under Burrow's tenure. He then moved to West Auckland Aquatics in 2007, and was coached by Donna Bouzaid. In the Fall of 2008, Fonua enrolled at Texas A&M on a swimming scholarship. He graduated with a Telecommunication and Multi-Media degree, with a Minor in Creative Writing in May 2013.
He was "the first Tongan swimmer to win a gold medal in international competition", when he took gold in the 50 metre breaststroke at the 2010 Oceania Swimming Championships.
In preparation for the 2012 London Olympics Amini was trained by New Zealander and designated head coach for Tonga, Jon Winter. He served as his nation's flag-bearer in the 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. As a swimmer at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he competed in the Men's 100 metre breaststroke, failing to reach the semifinals.
Fonua makes the journey to Tonga at least once a year to support Tonga's learn-to-swim programme.
Fonua is openly gay. He came out on campus during his freshman year and publicly came out in 2013 in part to defend his school from the perception that it is a hostile environment for LGBT students. The Texas A&M graduate made his announcement in his campus newspaper, The Battalion, where he also defended the school against accusations of homophobia.
Fonua says the announcement barely rated a mention on campus and admits he never expected such a big big response.
“The article itself was a favour to a friend in my creative writing class and it turned out to be a cover story... Had no intentions of it getting as big as it was and didn’t really see it as much of a coming out story because I’ve sort of been out to my closest friends and most of my immediate family for about five years now.” In January 2014 he was named in "Out Magazine"'s fourth annual "100 Most Eligible Bachelors" list.

Museo Castillo Serrallés

Museo Castillo Serrallés (English: "Serrallés Castle Museum") is a museum in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico, that showcases the history of sugar cane and rum industries and its impact in the economy of Puerto Rico. The most notorious feature of the museum is the building it sits on. The building is a large four-story structure built in the 1930s for the owner of Ponce's Destileria Serralles, one of Puerto Rico's largest rum destilleries. They also owned one-time home to Puerto Rico's largest sugar-factory called Central Mercedita, producers of the "Snow White" sugar brand. The building, known as Castillo Serrallés, was designed by Pedro Adolfo de Castro in 1930 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style.
The museum sits on a 2.5-acre lot and opened in February 1991. Visitors can tour the refurbished home, which has been furnished to appear as it did in the 1930s. There is also a temporary exhibit area for local artists. The Serrallés Castle is now part of a large complex that includes the Cruceta El Vigía, and a Japanese Garden. Even a butterfly garden is also within the museum grounds. By September 2010, the museum was receiving around 100,000 visitors per year.
Location.
The museum sits on a hilltop overlooking the downtown area (Ponce Pueblo). Built during the 1930s by order of Juan Eugenio Serrallés, son of businessman Juan Serrallés, founder of Destilería Serrallés, the museum structure sits on a exceedingly manicured property. The museum is one of the most iconic structutes in Puerto Rico and receives some 100,000 visitors a year.
History.
The house was purchased by the city of Ponce from the Serrallés heirs. While the castle was valued at $17–$25 million, it was purchased for a mere $400,000 and included much of the furniture in the sale. The city's initial intent was to turn it into a museum of Puerto Rican music. The Museum of Puerto Rican Music, however, was eventually established elsewhere in the city.
The castle was built in 1926 by local architect Pedro Adolfo de Castro y Besosa. 
It includes two huge terraces, an outside fountain, and a symmetrical backyard garden. Its interior includes a luxurious hall, a spacious dining room, and an interior courtyard.
Administration.
The museum is administered and operated by a non-governmental, non-profit, civic organization called "Patronato de Ponce." The organization received an endowment from the Ponce Municipal Government of $600,000 a year during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, but due to the world-wide economic downturn the Municipality dropped its endowment to $300,000 per year in 2010. It had also been receiving an undisclosed amount in yearly donations from the private sector, but $75,000 of that was also dropped due to the economy. The museum operates with a $1.2M yearly budget.
Displays and tours.
Access to the museum is through the side patio/balcony entrance on the southern end of the building. The museum can only be seen via guided group tours, and tour guides are very diligent in efforcing this rule as the administration does not want visitors wandering around the house on their own. The only on-your-own time comes at the gift shop.
The museum has four floors, and the displays on each floor focus on a particular aspect of the museum and the lives of its former owners.
The ground floor, which is the castle's former basement, houses all of the museum's rum and sugar-related expositions. On its northern end is the castle's former 3-car garage now turned into the museum's gift shop. This level also houses the main entrance to the museum on its southern end. On the main, center area are the former service quarters which used to house mechanical, electrical, and water storage facilities. These have been remodeled to provide for the turnstile entry, a restaurant, and an auditorium capable of sitting some 50 visitors.There are also some "Patronato" offices ion this floor.
The second floor contains the castle owners's former library, a central patio, a solarium, the living room, dining room, and the kitchen. More photos adorn the wall on this level, shown the development of both rum and sugar businesses. This level contains the former formal access to the house via its front main entrance.
The third floor contains all the sleeping quarters. These are shown with furniture as well as all types of personal accessories of the former occupants. Throughout this level are wall-hung pictures of the rum-producing family clan. The pictures here are oriented towards the personal and family live of the clan.
The fourth floor is the terrace, from where the most impressive and commanding views of the city are possible. Intended as a relaxed entertainment space, the terrace has both covered and uncovered areas.
Yard.
The city also rejuvenated the surrounding landscape. The backyard now consists of lush green grass, fountains, manicured shrubs, and lights. The first floor also houses an outdoor square that is covered by the roof over the second floor. The city uses this area to showcase the work of local artists and photographers. The area is now used for private weddings, "quinceañera" celebrations, and other similar social events.

Risør Underwater Post Office

Risør Underwater Post Office (Norwegian: "Risør Undervannspostkontor") is a post office constructed by use of a diving bell, built as a tourist attraction and located on the ocean floor in Risør, a small town on the southern Norwegian coast. Authorized by the Norwegian Postal system as a bona fide post office, eligible for collection and processing of letters, it is the only "dry" underwater post office in the world; other underwater post offices operate in wet environments. It is in operation during the summer months, as this period coincides with the tourist season as well as the warmer climate.
History.
Conceived by the local SCUBA diving club, the underwater post office was established June 4, 2004. It was placed at a depth of 4 metres next to a pier designed to accommodate large ships, a pier which also houses the local Aquarium.
Initially a success, the number of letters dwindled after the first few years. As the work (and cost) involved with the running of the post office began to take its toll, the closure of the office was decided and the 2011 season was to be its last in service. However, the town's tourism board and local businesses offered their support and persuaded the divers to continue the tradition.
From its opening in 2004 to 2011, the underwater postmaster was Håkon Sandvik; from 2012 onwards Tore Bjørn Hovde has the responsibility. Both are members of the local SCUBA diving club. Other members also contribute periodically.
Structure.
The post office is a form of diving bell constructed in fiberglass, and is filled with air so that the mail stays dry. The structure is moored to the bottom by a 5-ton weight.
Operation.
Visitors can post their mail in a post box by the pier and this is then emptied two to three times per week. The postmaster takes the mail down to the post office by means of a watertight bag. Inside, the mail is stamped before it is returned to the surface. It is then entered into normal post circulation.
Mail sent.
Records are kept by the postmaster, detailing the amounts of cards and letters that are sent through the underwater post office. In addition to 266 "bottles" (available for purchase at the Aquarium), the amounts are the following:

The Boys (1991 film)

The Boys (aka The Guys) is a drama/black comedy television film starring James Woods and John Lithgow. It was directed by Glenn Jordan, who had previously worked with Woods on the 1986 TV movie "Promise" and would later work with Woods again in 1994 for the TV drama film "Jane's House". The film first aired on September 15, 1991 on the ABC Network.
Background.
The film stars James Woods as Walter Farmer and John Lithgow as Artie Margulies. Others in the film include Joanna Gleason as Marie, Eve Gordon as Amanda, Alan Rosenberg as the Psychiatrist and Rosemary Dunsmore as Helene.
Today, the film remains out-of-print in America, having never received a VHS or DVD release. In the UK, where the film was re-titled "The Guys", the movie was released on VHS via CIC Video, where it has remained out-of-print ever since.
The film's tagline reads ""Artie has a nasty habit... ...Walter can't live with it. A story of love, life & cigarettes."
"The Boys" was created by production companies Papazian-Hirsch Entertainment International and William Link Productions.
Writing and Filming.
The film was largely inspired by the lives of the film's writer William Link and his writing partner, Richard Levinson, and Levinson's death. However, the key plot point of the story didn't happen in reality. In real-life, Richard Levinson was the smoker.
A day before the original broadcast on the ABC Network, an article with the Los Angeles Times was based on the film, under the headline "'Til Death Do They Part". The article stated that writer Link used to say his relationship with long-time writing partner Levinson was like marriage without the sex. The story was written by Link as a sort of private therapy to get over Levinson's death. In the article, it is mentioned that neither Woods or Lithgow worry about taking time out of their film careers to do a TV film. ""Each of us looks for good material. And a lot of good material today is written for television,"" said Lithgow, whilst Woods stated ""There's always been great material on television"".
In the article, it is stated that the film was the first TV movie to deal directly with the issue of secondary smoke, although both leading actors insisted that "The Boys" was not a network disease-of-the-week movie. ""The secondary smoke is certainly an important aspect of the story,"" Lithgow said. ""One man is dying because the other man smokes. It's an important little turn of the plot, but it's sort of the last thing I think about. This is not an advocacy film, in my mind, at all."" ""But (secondary smoke) is the motor of the story,"" Woods said. ""It's the deus ex machina, if you will, that propels the story. It causes this almost repressed friendship to finally blossom. It's that terrible reality in life that sometimes we only are able to express our love to people when we're losing them or have lost them."" It was also stated that in a short time, Lithgow and Woods said they developed the kind of comic rapport and unspoken bond that Levinson and Link shared. The repartee is evident as they tell how Lithgow was chosen for "The Boys."
Originally, after Woods was cast in the film, the filmmakers then searched for the best person to play Woods' partner. Woods stated in the Los Angeles Times article ""I told my agent to close his eyes and imagine the best person to play Arty, and I'll do the same thing. And we both came up with Mickey Rooney, but he wasn't available. After, we went for Andy Rooney, and then Andy Garcia, then finally John. But John was doing 'The Last Elephant' at the time."" ""I was off in Africa,"" Lithgow said. ""You couldn't phone in and you couldn't get calls out, but somehow or other a faxed script arrived on my bed one night by a carrier caribou.""
Describing the acting in the film, Lithgow stated ""The first time I saw James was in a student production of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'The Victors,' when he was 19 years old, even back then, I'd heard an awful lot about him and his work process. We work in a very, very similar way, which is perfect for this movie."" Woods added ""It's a sort of shorthand,"". ""Very fast,"" Lithgow said. ""In fact, the relationship between these two writers is so easy and fun for us to play, because that's very much like our collaborative relationship as actors. We have already devised a thousand little tricks. His mind just whirs along, and I love to keep pace with it.""
According to the article, Woods and Lithgow were immediately looking for a new project together after "The Boys". ""We have the same agency, so we told our agents to put their heads together on our behalf,"" Lithgow said. ""And they'll probably come up with some fabulous script, and then give it to Redford and Newman,"" Woods said. Both Woods and Lithgow wouldn't work together again.
In a mid-April 1991 article with Ocala Star-Banner, writer Link spoke of the film's story and the writing of the script. ""Call it therapy. I had mentioned this concept to Dick several years before he died, but he did not want to write it. I asked him why, and he said "you guess". I don't think he wanted to be under scrutiny in promoting the show, with people asking him, "Why are you chain-smoking in this interview when you just produced a movie that is against it?" A week after Dick died in 1987, I was at ABC with Brandon Stoddard (the network's former programming chief). He said "What have your got for us?" I told him this idea, he thought it was terrific, and he said I had an on-the-air commitment. He also said "I think it'll be very good therapy for you." Dick and I had written every line together. I was used to working in a room with my best friend for 41 years, and when he died, I felt stranded. I was very fearful that I couldn't write, because my crutch wasn't there anymore. It was as if I'd had an amputation, and it took me about 10 months to get around to this. In four two-day weekends, I wrote "The Boys," and it just poured out. It was like someone was dictating it to me.""
In the same article, Link spoke of how any worries of writing solo were soothed considerably with the signing of the two central roles to Woods and Lithgow. ""It's rare in this business that you get two people who are so dedicated to the material. They wouldn't change one syllable, and they treated the script like Biblical text. That's amazing, because sometimes, you work with people who learn their dialogue right on the set while the director is blocking the shot."" In the article, Woods also stated that he believed that "The Boys" is ""very lighthearted in its approach to a very serious subject. It's a very odd piece, but in the best sense of that term. It's not a structured three-act story, but a pastiche of the relationship of these two wonderful men who loved each other for so long. Some of it's very funny and some of it's very sad, but finally, it's like a two-hour window into this long relationship. It's a real love letter from Bill Link to his friendship with Dick Levinson.""
Plot.
Walter and Artie are almost married. They've churned out scripts for movies and TV shows for 20 years, and as writing partners, they have shared a lifetime of experience, experiences that include Artie's three packs of cigarettes a day. Despite his squeaky clean lifestyle, now Walter has lung cancer, where he is given six months to live, and his life is literally going up in Artie's smoke. As Walter fights cancer he also tries to put his affairs in order by teaching writing to prison inmates, talking to his son and ex-wife, and getting his partner to quit smoking.
Critical reception.
Reportedly, upon release, the film was highly acclaimed.
Allmovie gave the film three out of five stars and wrote ""The Boys is an "a clef" celebration of the famed script writing team of Richard Levinson and William Link. Link himself wrote this story about two lifelong collaborator/friends. Some observers have suggested that Link penned this tale more out of guilt than friendship; whatever the case, he wisely avoids overloading the material with sentiment, allowing the "boys" to kid around and squabble as much as they ever had. As a bonus, there's a Columbo-style mystery angle in the proceedings to keep the hard-core Levinson/Link fans happy.""
Around the time of the original broadcasting, Entertainment Weekly awarded the film a C grade and wrote ""Woods and Lithgow spend the length of the movie examining their friendship and talking, talking, talking. Although Woods has a girlfriend and Lithgow a wife, much of The Boys operates like a two-character play. The Boys is an exhausting, all-too-cleverly-crafted tragicomedy. The TV movie was written by William Link, who for years wrote and produced scripts with his partner, Richard Levinson. Levinson died in 1987; The Boys is clearly Link's salute to his collaborator and friend. This noble, heartfelt gesture has yielded a sentimental story.""
Sky Movies gave a favorable review, stating ""This TV movie will be of interest to anyone who has ever sat through a Columbo case or a Murder, She Wrote mystery. It tells the story of the final months in the life of their creator Richard Levinson as he fought lung cancer. It was penned by his partner-in-crime William Link, which makes it all the more poignant. Given the subject matter, The Boys is surprisingly funny. The plot bubbles along nicely and only puts a foot wrong when it tries to be clever or ends up a touch melodramatic. But Artie and Walter emerge as real flesh and blood characters and no-one can doubt the depth of feelings harboured by Link for his late colleague or the pain at his loss.""
Around the time of the original broadcasting, Chicago Tribune gave an unfavorable review, writing ""As a two-hour anti-smoking advertisement, "The Boys" is an effective message. As a two-hour homage from one-half of a famous screenwriting team to his dead partner, "The Boys" is an affectionate tribute. But as a showcase for the talents of two fine actors, John Lithgow and James Woods, "The Boys" is a bust, just as it is as entertainment or tearjerker. Sure, it's well-intentioned. William Link who, along with the late Richard Levinson, created such hits as "Columbo," "Mannix" and "Murder, She Wrote," obviously means this film as a memorial to Levinson. But filled with a shocking playfulness, the film doesn't delineate, in any interesting fashion, the nature of the friendship or the pain of its end. Woods and Lithgow are forced to behave like rambunctious, emotionally shackled toddlers. Surely there are people who behave with such virtue, who try to tidy their lives. Perhaps this is really the way Levinson behaved. But here it has a forced ring, at once too giddy and righteous.""
Around the time of the original broadcasting, Lawrence Journal-World gave an unfavorable review, stating ""Take two first-rate character actors, the prodigiously talented John Lithgow and James Woods. Give them a script unworthy of their powers. Watch their light blast through the holes in it like laser beams. The film has its moments, to be sure, but mostly it's the pleasure of watching these two pros at work. "The Boys" is somewhere between drama and black comedy, a modified Felix-and-Oscar story hinged on passive smoking, cancer and male bonding.""

Stuart R. Schram

Stuart Reynolds Schram (February 27, 1924 – July 8, 2012) was an American physicist, political scientist and sinologist who specialised in the study of modern Chinese politics. He was particularly well known for his works on the life and thought of Mao Zedong.
In 1972, he married Marie-Annick Lancelot. They had a son, Arthur. 
Biography.
Schram was born in Excelsior, Minnesota in 1924. He studied physics at the University of Minnesota, and graduated "magna cum laude" in 1944. After graduation he was drafted into the US army, and assigned to work on the Manhattan Project in Chicago, as a member of the team responsible for developing of an atomic bomb.
After the end of World War II, influenced by his involvement on the development of the atomic bomb, he decided to change his focus of academic study, and enrolled at Columbia University in New York where he studied for a PhD in political science. He went to France to carry out research for his dissertation on the political behavior of French Protestants, and after receiving his PhD he moved to France. 
In the early 1950s, Schram wrote several articles on East and West Berlin which drew the attention of the American State Department, which withdrew his passport, though restoring it in 1955. From 1954 to 1967 he carried out research at the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques in Paris, but as a non-French citizen he could not become a Professor or oversee doctoral dissertations. During the late 1950s he turned his attention to Chinese politics, and started to learn Chinese so that he could base his research on the primary sources. He focused his research on Chairman Mao, and by 1963 he had completed a book on the "Political Thought of Mao Tse-tung". In 1966 Penguin Books published his seminal biography of Mao. These works made him prominent in the emerging field of modern China studies. The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London offered Schram a chair. Schram led establishment of the Contemporary China Institute and the continued development of journal, China Quarterly. 
In 1989 he retired from his position at SOAS, and moved back to America. At the invitation of Roderick MacFarquhar, Director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University, he started work on the translation and editing of a ten-volume collection of the revolutionary writings of Mao Zedong, seven volumes of which were published before his death.
He died in France in July 2012 after a stroke.
Legacy.
In the view of his colleague and fellow Mao scholar, Roderick MacFarquhar, Schram wrestled with the problem of making any overall assessment of Mao. MacFarquar recalls Schram saying “I agree with the current Chinese view that Mao’s merits outweighed his faults, but it is not easy to put a figure on the positive and negative aspects. How does one weigh, for example, the good fortune of hundreds of millions of peasants in getting land against the execution, in the course of land reform and the 'Campaign against Counter-Revolutionaries,' or in other contexts, of millions, some of whom certainly deserved to die, but others of whom undoubtedly did not? How does one balance the achievements in economic development during the first Five-Year Plan, or during the whole twenty-seven years of Mao’s leadership after 1949, against the starvation which came in the wake of the misguided enthusiasm of the Great Leap Forward, or the bloody shambles of the Cultural Revolution?” Schram added, “In the last analysis, however, I am more interested in the potential future impact of his thought than in sending Mao as an individual to Heaven or to Hell.” Commenting on Schram's Mao biography and his "The Political Thought of Mao Tse-tung", Harvard scholar Tony Saich observed: “I do not think he got Mao wrong but his analysis was very much text-based and this meant that he did not focus so much on the hard politics that Mao engaged in.”

German submarine U-242

German submarine "U-242" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
The submarine was laid down on 30 September 1942 at the "Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft" yard at Kiel as 'werk' 676, launched on 20 July 1943 and commissioned on 14 August under the command of "Oberleutnant zur See" Karl-Wilhelm Pancke.
After training with the 5th U-boat Flotilla at Kiel, she went to the 3rd flotilla to work operationally from 1 June 1944. She then returned to the 5th flotilla on 6 July and moved to the 8th flotilla for operations on 1 August. She was reassigned to the 5th flotilla a third time from 16 February 1945.
In seven patrols, "U-242" sank two ships totalling 2,095 GRT and an auxiliary warship of 500 tons.
She was sunk by a mine in the St. George's Channel in April 1945.
Operational career.
1st patrol.
"U-242"s first patrol, like most of the others, was carried out in Norwegian and Baltic waters. She had already made the short voyage from Kiel to Stavanger in Norway in May 1944; her first patrol proper started from the Norwegian port and terminated in Bergen, also in Norway. She then spent some time shuttling between Bergen, Stavanger, Kristiansand, Kiel, Reval (also known as Tallinn in Estonia) and Helsinki in Finland.
2nd patrol.
The boat's second foray was similar to the first, a series of short 'jabs' from Helsinki and Grand Hotel.
3rd patrol.
"U-242" sank the Soviet barges "VRD-96 Del'fin" and the "KKO-2" on 25 August 1944; one day before returning to Helsinki.
4th, 5th and 6th patrols.
More round-robin journeys were carried out, travelling between Paldiski (known to the Germans as Baltisch Port), Windau in Latvia (now known as Ventspils), Pillau (Baltiysk), Danzig (Gdansk in modern Poland), Horten in Norway and Kristiansand. It was during her fifth patrol that the Finnish ship, the "Rigel", was sunk on 28 October 1944 by a mine laid by "U-242" on 21 September.
7th patrol and loss.
For her seventh sortie, she was sent to the waters off southwest Britain. This was to prove her undoing. On 5 April 1945, she struck a mine in the St. Georges Channel (between southeast Ireland and Wales), off St. David's Head. Forty-four men died; there were no survivors.

Almere Poort

Almere Poort is a borough ("stadsdeel") of Almere, Netherlands. It is the newest part of what is a new city itself, with the first building completed only in 2005. Although Almere is a planned city, Almere Poort was not in the original city plans, but is rather a result of revised urban planning in accordance to Almere's more recent development plans assuming much higher target population and more prominent role as a satellite urban centre to Amsterdam.
Almere Poort is located on the western bank of the IJmeer, with the Almeerderstrand beach forming the borough's (as well as municipality's and province's) western boundary. It borders Almere Haven to the south, Almere Stad to the east and the yet-undeveloped (as of 2012) designated district of Almere Pampus to the North. The A6 motorway runs along the borough's southern border, with one exit at Poortdreef and one at Hogering, the latter of which runs along the eastern border. The Flevolijn railway line runs semi-diagonally across the borough, with local trains stopping at the borough's station Almere Poort railway station. The former Almere Strand railway station, which was serviced only during events at Almeerderstrand, was also within the boundaries of Almere Poort. It was demolished in 2012. Since then, buses run between Almere Poort station and Almeerderstrand during events.
Almere Poort differs from the other boroughs and districts in that residential development does not follow the model typical for other districts of Almere, which is mostly large-scale single-family housing developments built according to a common plan. Contrary to this, the district features both high-density apartment buildings, as well as land parcels available for free private housing development. Also contrary to older districts of Almere, Almere-Poort refers to its residential areas as "kwartieren" rather than "wijken". The designated parts of Almere Poort according to the official website of the municipality are:

Historical Dictionary Project of the Hebrew Language

The Historical Dictionary Project of the Hebrew Language (HDP) (Hebrew: מִפְעַל הַמִּלּוֹן הַהִיסְטוֹרִי) is a long-term research undertaking of the Academy of the Hebrew Language. According to the Academy's website, "The overarching goal of the HDP is to present the history and development of the Hebrew lexicon, from the earliest occurrences of words down through their most recent documentation." It aims to encompass the entire Hebrew lexicon throughout its history; that is, to present every Hebrew word in its morphological, semantical, and contextual development from its first appearance in written texts to the present. 
The editorial board consists of Prof. Chaim A. Cohen, editor-in-chief; Prof. Steven (Shmuel) Fassberg, associate editor; and Dr. Gabriel Birnbaum, writer of the entries.
Origins.
As early as 1937, the president of Va'ad HaLashon ("The Language Committee", which later became the Academy of the Hebrew Language), Prof. Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai, proposed the establishment of "a large endeavor which prepares an academic dictionary of our language, in all of the periods and evolutions that it has endured from the moment it is documented, until today." A formal decision to undertake the HDP was taken in 1955.
Preparation.
The HDP is based on Hebrew texts up until 1100 CE, and large selections of Hebrew literature from the period thereafter until the founding of the State of Israel. As much scholarly attention had already been given to the Hebrew Bible and the Pseudepigrapha, it was decided to begin with texts from the post-biblical period. The database thus reflects more than 2000 years of Hebrew writing. Such a project requires a large textual database, and the HDP was one of the first in the world to develop and use a computerized concordance. In 2005, some fifty years after commencement, it was decided there was enough material to begin the writing of entries.
Sources.
The Academy initially debated as to whether it should create a series of dictionaries according to periods or literary genres, or whether it should work towards a single integrated work. In 1959 it was decided that there would be one central dictionary containing all periods, i.e., ancient, medieval and modern Hebrew literature. Material was first gathered from ancient literature written between 200 BCE and 1100 CE, and later, modern literature from 1750 onwards. Sources include material discovered at the Cairo Genizah. Material from Karaite sources is also included, and material from Samaritan sources may be added in the future. Compilation of the list of documentary sources for the dictionary was completed in 1963 with the publication of "Sefer ha-Meqorot [Source Book" for sources "from the canonization of the Bible until the conclusion of the Geonic period." The "Source Book" serves as the foundation for all work on the dictionary.
Database.
Work on the HDP is based on the best available manuscripts of the texts, which are entered into the database and then analyzed. In those cases where there are several extant manuscripts, the clearest and most complete manuscript is selected for incorporation into the dictionary. 
In 1982 the Academy published a sample entry for the dictionary based on the triliteral root ערב. The 88-page entry was published in the Academy’s journal "Leshonenu" ("Our Language"). 
In 2010, the database of Hebrew texts from the post-biblical period down through the 11th century, and the database of modern texts from 1750 onwards, were united into a single database. This database serves as an archive of not only individual words, but also complete texts that have been carefully copied from their source. In addition to enabling grammatical analyses and concordance searches, the archives also contain unique corpora, such as Hebrew poetry from the 11th century. The database is accessible to the public. 
The database draws upon some 4,300 Hebrew sources, from the classic Rabbinic literature period (2nd century BCE) through the Geonic period (11th century CE) to 1947. Literary strata and genres represented include the Dead Sea Scrolls, inscriptions, Talmud and Midrash, Geonic literature, prayer and piyyut, Karaite literature, science, deeds, colophons, amulets, and the like. Essentially a concordance, the online resource accesses all the words in the database and enables retrieval of citations according to roots, lemmata, and declined forms or combinations, as well as of specific texts by title, author, date, or literary genre. It is updated as new research becomes available and as more old texts are discovered.
As of 7 June 2010, the twenty-million word database contained 4,056 Hebrew roots. Of its 54,807 entries, 14,592 are nouns, adjectives and adverbs, and 13,979 are verbs. The balance consists of personal names, numbers, prepositions and similar lexical items. The size of the database on that date was about 40 gigabytes. The complete lexical archive will contain at least 25 million quotations.

Vuna Takitakimālohi

Siaosi Vuna Takitakimālohi (c. 1844 – January 1862) was a Prince of Tonga, the only legitimate son and heir to King George Tupou I.
Life.
Born around 1844, he was the only surviving son of Tongan King George Tupou I and Sālote Lupepauʻu, Tupou's sole legitimate wife. His only full-blooded brother Tu'ukitau had died at the age of four in 1842.
He was named "Siaosi" or George after his father, who in turn had taken the name in honor of King George III of the United Kingdom while his mother was named "Sālote" or Charlotte after Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.
King Tupou I's other children, a son Tēvita ʻUnga and a daughter Sālote Mafileʻo Pilolevu, were repudiated as illegitimate offspring along with their mothers, who were his secondary consorts, after marriage in 1834 to Prince Vuna's mother under Christian rites. 
His mother was the former wife of Laufilitonga, the last Tuʻi Tonga, and his maternal great grandmother was Nanasipauʻu, who held the high rank of Tuʻi Tonga Fefine. 
At the age of seventeen or eighteen, Prince Vuna died in January 1862, unmarried, leaving his father without an heir. His death was greatly mourned by the people of Tonga. At the prince's funeral, the King allowed his subjects to restore the traditional rite of "tukuofo", the offering of mats and food to the dead. This gesture prompted the presiding Reverend W. G. R. Stephinson to openly reprimand the King and discipline the native participants resulting in a rift between the King and the Wesleyan Church. The succession would remain vacant for thirteen years until the promulgation of Tonga's first constitution in 1875, which legitimized Vuna's half-brother Tēvita ʻUnga and named him Crown Prince. King Tupou I would outlive ʻUnga and all three of his grandchildren; he was succeeded by his great grandson George Tupou II.

Robert F. R. Lewis

Captain Robert F. R. Lewis (30 January 1826 - 23 February 1881) was an officer in the United States Navy. He participated in the Paraguay Expedition, fought in the Mexican War and American Civil War, and served briefly as commander of the Asiatic Squadron.
Naval career.
Lewis was born on 30 January 1826 in Washington, D.C.. He was appointed as a midshipman in October 1841 and immediately was attached to the sloop-of-war , which was fitting out at Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia, at the time. Before "Warren" could put to sea, however, Lewis was transferred to the receiving ship at the navy yard, remaining aboard her for a few months. In 1842, he was attached to the sloop-of-war , and served aboard her until 1845 off the coast of Africa and in the West Indies Squadron.
Mexican War.
Lewis next reported to the sloop-of-war at Norfolk, Virginia, and served aboard her in the Pacific Squadron from 1845 to 1848. Aboard "Cyane", he took part in the Mexican War, seeing action in the capture of San Diego, California – then a part of Mexico – the destruction of a Mexican artillery battery at San Blas, the seizure of La Paz in Baja California, and the bombardment of Guaymas in Sonora, where "Cyane" cut out the Mexican brig "Condor" while under fire from Mexican troops and artillery ashore and burned the small Mexican fleet there. "Cyane" went on to clear the Gulf of California of Mexican ships over the course of the next month and participated in the capture of Mazatlán before relieving the siege by Mexican troops and Yaqui Indians of San José del Cabo. Upon "Cyane"s return to the United States at the conclusion of the war in 1848, United States Secretary of the Navy John Y. Mason congratulated her crew for their significant contribution to the American victory.
1848-1861.
After returning to the United States, Lewis reported to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1848 and passed his examination. Sources differ on the date of his promotion to passed midshipman, stating both that it came on 10 August 1847 while he was aboard "Cyane" and that it was in 1849 after he passed his examination at the Naval Academy.
In 1849, Lewis went aboard the steamer , aboard which he cruised in the West Indies and along the Spanish Main. In 1850, he transferred to the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., for a few months, then in 1851 detached to serve aboard commercial steamers of the Collins Line on two or three transatlantic voyages between New York City and Liverpool, England. In 1852 he began an 18-month tour aboard the sloop-of-war , in service at the time as a training ship at the Naval Academy, then reported to the brig , which was fitting out at the Norfolk Navy Yard at the time. Before "Dolphin" sailed, he transferred in 1853 to the stores ship , which was fitting out at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. During his two years aboard "Supply", he was promoted to master on 14 September 1855 and to lieutenant the following day, but he detached from "Supply" in 1855 before she embarked on the first of her two voyages to the Mediterranean to bring camels from the Ottoman Empire home to the United States for experimental use by the United States Armys Camel Corps.
After a short leave period, Lewis was assigned to the receiving ship at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1856. He transferred to the new sailing frigate in 1858 and served aboard her during a three-year cruise, during which she took part in the Paraguay Expedition and operated in the West Indies.
American Civil War.
Lewis was aboard "Sabine" when the American Civil War broke out in April 1861. He spent his last few months aboard "Sabine" on duty in the Union blockade of the Confederate States of America, serving in the blockade of Pensacola, Florida. He commanded a group of boats which carried reinforcements to Fort Pickens under threat from Confederate Fort McRae and was made executive officer of "Sabine". After "Sabine" was decommissioned at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, later in 1861, Lewis took a leave of absence from the Navy, but returned to service later in the year as executive officer of the steamer in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 16 July 1862.
In 1862, Lewis became commanding officer of the gunboat on the Mississippi River, leading her in action at Man Shack Bend. "Itasca" later was reassigned to the blockade of Texas, where Lewis led her in an engagement with a Confederate artillery battery at Velasco, in the capture of two blockade runners, and in running aground and destroying two or three other blockade runners. After "Itasca" was ordered north to undergo repairs in 1863, Lewis was detached from her and took a short leave of absence.
Upon returning to service, Lewis spent three months at Baltimore, Maryland, to oversee the repair and fitting out of ships there, then was sent to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in 1864, where he commanded successively the bark , the gunboat , the sidewheel steamer , and the monitor in the blockade of Charleston, South Carolina, and on the St. Johns River. He was in command of "Nantucket" when she closed to destroy a stranded blockade runner with gunfire off Charleston and engaged the Confederate artillery batteries on Sullivan's Island, as well as during later duty at Port Royal, South Carolina, when "Nantucket" guarded the receiving ship in case "New Hampshire" was targeted by the Confederate States Navy ironclad CSS "Stonewall". After the Civil War ended in April 1865, Lewis brought "Nantucket" to Philadelphia, where she was laid up.
Post-Civil War.
In 1865, Lewis joined the staff of the Naval Academy, first as senior instructor in seamanship and later as superintendent of grounds and buildings, and was promoted to commander on 29 January 1867. From 1869 to 1871 he commanded the steamer in the Pacific Squadron, then was on the Board of Inspectors from 1871 to 1874. He served in the Asiatic Squadron from 1874 to 1875, first in command of the gunboat and then in command of the sloop-of-war , and he temporarily served as commander of the entire squadron from 24 June to 16 August 1875. Detaching from "Kearsarge" in November 1875, he returned to the United States and spent four months awaiting orders before reporting for duty as Inspector of Ordnance at the Norfolk Navy Yard. He was promoted to captain on 26 February 1878.
On 6 September 1879, Lewis took command of the screw sloop-of-war two days before she recommissioned for service in the South Atlantic Squadron as the flagship of Rear Admiral Andrew Bryson.
Personal life.
Lewis was married to Henrietta A. Lewis (31 March 1830–12 August 1915). They had five living children at the time of his death.
Death.
Lewis contracted an illness while aboard "Shenandoah" and became sick enough to be ordered to return to the United States for treatment. During the voyage home, he died at sea off Martinique on 23 February 1881. He is buried with this wife at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.

The Merry Frolics of Satan

The Merry Frolics of Satan (, literally "The Four Hundred Tricks of the Devil") is a 1906 French silent film directed by and starring Georges Méliès. The film, an updated comedic adaptation of the Faust legend, follows the adventures of an engineer who barters with the Devil for superhuman powers and is forced to face the consequences. It was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 849–870 in its catalogues, where it is advertised as a "grande pièce fantastique en 35 tableaux".
Summary.
An English engineer and inventor, William Crackford, is visited in his workshop by a messenger, who tells him that the famous alchemist Alcofrisbas is interested in selling him a powerful talisman. Arriving in Alcofrisbas's mysterious laboratory, where they are attacked and confused by magically moving and transforming pieces of furniture, Crackford and his servant John explain to the alchemist that they hope to make a high-speed trip around the world. Alcofrisbas promises to make the trip possible. With the help of his seven laboratory assistants, Alcofrisbas makes a batch of large magical pills for the engineer and demonstrates that, by hurling a pill upon the ground, Crackford can have any wish gratified. Crackford, in his excitement, does not read the terms of the contract he is asked to sign, and so remains blissfully unaware that he has just sold his soul to the Devil. When Crackford and John leave, "Alcofrisbas" resumes his true identity—Mephistopheles—and his "assistants" are revealed to be the Seven Deadly Sins.
Crackford comes home to dinner, where his wife and daughters are waiting for him. Wanting to try out the pills, he throws one to the floor. Immediately, two servants in livery burst out of a trunk, opening it to reveal more servants and a smaller trunk, who open it to reveal still more servants and another trunk, and so on; the process goes on until the dining room is full of servants, who load all of Crackford's furniture, as well as Crackford himself and his family, into the trunks. In the blink of an eye the trunks become a miniature train for the family, driven by John the servant. Crackford's high-speed tour has begun.
The tiny train wends its way out of the city, meeting with ridicule from onlookers. Arriving in the countryside, most of the train and all of Crackford's family are lost in an accident with a collapsing bridge; Crackford, caring only for his world tour, continues on undismayed. Crackford and John stop at a village inn, the landlord of which is again Mephistopheles in disguise. The two travelers find their attempts to eat confounded by magical disappearances and transformations; in despair, they go to the kitchen to eat with the servants, only to be disrupted by apes and demons in a farcical pandemonium of appearances and disappearances using every possible entrance and exit.
Fleeing out of the inn, the travelers make an escape in a horse and buggy, which Mephistopheles promptly transforms into a magical carriage made out of stars and comets and drawn by a bizarre mythological horse. Mephistopheles, following the travelers in an automobile, drives them up the slope of Mount Vesuvius and directly into an eruption. In a burst of lava and flames, the infernal carriage is shot into the sky and makes a voyage through space, flying past stars and planets. Colliding with a thunderstorm, the carriage bursts apart; Crackford and John tumble through space and crash through the ceiling of a dining room. Just as Crackford thinks he is about to get a bite to eat at last, Mephistopheles appears to fulfill the terms of the contract. Crackford is led into the Underworld, where gleeful demons turn him on a spit over the infernal flames.
Production.
On 16 February 1839, "Les Pilules du diable", a stage "féerie" written by Ferdinand Laloue, Auguste Anicet-Bourgeois, and Clement-Philippe Laurent, premiered at the Théâtre National de Cirque-Olympique in Paris. The play was frequently revived and became known as one of the classics of the "féerie" genre. A new adaptation of the classic play, "Les Quatre Cents Coups du diable" by Victor de Cottens and Victor Darlay, premiered on 23 December 1905 at the Théâtre du Châtelet. This version of the play, though still in the "féerie" tradition of elaborately staged fantasy, introduced a modernized setting as well as an element of skeptical satire to the story.
Méliès had previously worked with de Cottens on the 1904 Folies Bergère revue, for which Méliès produced a satirical film sequence about Leopold II of Belgium; the sequence was screened at three hundred performances of the revue, and was later released commercially by Méliès's studio as "An Adventurous Automobile Trip". For "Les Quatre Cents Coups du diable", de Cottens
and Darlay commissioned Méliès to make two short films to be projected as part of the entertainment: "Le Voyage dans l'éspace" ("The Space Trip") and "Le Cyclone" ("The Cyclone"). Méliès also assisted in the development of the script of the production, which enjoyed a great success and ran for some five hundred performances.
Méliès's film "The Merry Frolics of Satan" is freely based on the stage play (the title was changed to avoid copyright ligitation), and incorporates one of Méliès's two film sequences for the production: the voyage of the infernal carriage through space. (The other film sequence, "Le Cyclone", does not appear in "The Merry Frolics of Satan", but was incorporated into Méliès's later film "Robert Macaire and Bertrand".) The rest of the film consists of new material made at least six months after the film sequences for the play, and with different actors. The farcically choreographed kitchen scene faithfully reproduces the set and stage machinery that had been traditionally used for this scene in "Les Pilules du diable" ever since 1839.

Stack light

Stack lights "(aka: indicator lights, AndOn lights, warning lights, industrial signal lights, tower lights and light towers)" are commonly used on equipment in industrial manufacturing and process control environments to provide visual and audible indicators of a machine state or process event to machine operators, technicians, production managers and factory personnel.
General.
Stack lights are used in similar applications as beacon lights/strobes, however the information they typically display encompasses more machine/process conditions. Stack lights typically use incandescent, LED or xenon-type strobes as their illumination source.
Stack lights are generally columnar structures in a variety of shapes, placing colour-coded indicator segments on top of one another in a "stacked" orientation. A stack light will typically have up to 5 differently coloured segments to indicate various conditions on the machine or process.
Segments in any combination of (typically) red, yellow, green, blue or clear white are actuated independently and are either off, solid-on (continuous) or flashing.
Stack lights are passive devices that may be controlled directly by programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems, PC control systems or hardwired to machine controls such as timers, sensors and latching relays.
Discrete signals activate illuminated segments at common industrial control voltages (including 12Vdc, 24Vac/dc, 115Vac, 230Vac). Some units support fieldbus networked control through popular industrial networks such as Modbus, DeviceNet, Profibus, CAN-Open or ASi.
Flashing control may be provided by the stack light's internal circuitry or externally controlled with timers or logic controllers.
Stack lights are available for all types of industrial environments including washdown (IP65) and explosion proof.
Function.
Stack lights are used in a variety of machines and process environments; specific colour-coding is assigned by the system designer.
Commonly used colour codes for machine state conditions include:
IEC60073 addresses machine state colour-coding & acoustic alerting, which can be applied to devices including panel pilot lights & stack lights. Machine operator intervention is typically required in red and yellow machine states, as these are normally errors or warnings. Manual intervention is possibly necessary in blue and white conditions.
Applications.
Common applications include, but are not limited to:

Masahiko Aoki

Masahiko Aoki (born April 1, 1938), is a Japanese economist, Tomoye and Henri Takahashi Professor Emeritus of Japanese Studies in the Economics Department, and Senior Fellow of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies at Stanford University. Aoki is known for his work in comparative institutional analysis, corporate governance, the theory of the firm, and comparative East Asian development.
Education.
Aoki was born in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture in 1938. Aoki received his B.A. and M.A. in economics from Tokyo University in 1962 and 1964. In 1967 Aoki received his Ph.D in economics from the University of Minnesota, where he studied under John Chipman and Nobel Laureate Leonid Hurwicz.
Academic career.
Aoki became assistant professor at Stanford University in 1967, Harvard University in 1968, and Kyoto University in 1969, where he remained until his promotion to Professor in 1977. In 1984, he returned to Stanford University as a professor of economics, and became Professor Emeritus of Kyoto University in 2001. In order to focus on research and take a greater role in international activities, he became Professor Emeritus of Stanford University in 2004. Since 2011 he has been the senior Visiting Fellow at the Asian Development Bank Institute in Tokyo. Aoki has also held visiting positions at Tokyo University, Keio University, Hitotsubashi University, Harvard University, the London School of Economics, and the Max Planck Institute in Cologne.
Research.
Aoki's major academic contributions to economics and the social sciences in general are in the fields of the comparative institutional analysis, the theory of the firm, and corporate governance.
Comparative institutional analysis.
Aoki's research has made him a pioneer and leader in comparative institutional analysis.
Together with Paul Milgrom, Avner Greif, Yingyi Qian, and Marcel Fafchamp, he created a comparative institutional field in the economics department at Stanford in the early 1990s. They conceptualized institutions as equilibrium phenomena in societal games rather than something given exogenously by factors such as law, policy, and culture. From this perspective he laid analytical foundations for basic concepts in institutional analysis such as institutional complementarities, social embedeness (linked games), and public representations mediating the salient features of the state of play and individual beliefs, and applied them to comparative analysis across countries and regions. Aoki was the first to directly apply institutional analysis to Japan, arguing in the late 1980s that institutions such as lifetime employment, the main bank system, long-term supplier relations, and government as an interest group mediator were in mutually complementary, game-theoretic equilibria in the context of Japan's institutional evolution. 
In his 2001 work, "Toward a Comparative Institutional Analysis", Aoki developed a conceptual and analytical game theoretic approach to comparative studies of institutions. He used this framework to analyze how institutions evolve, why institutional structures are diverse across economies, and what factors lead to institutional change or rigidity.
Theory of the firm.
"The Cooperative Game Theory of the Firm" (1984) was a first attempt to synthesize and unify various theories of the firm, such as neoclassical, worker controlled, and stakeholder society views, as special cases of corporate governance with varied weights of bargaining power attributed to the members of the firm. Aoki's interests then moved into comparisons of various internal information structures of the firm (hierarchical, horizontal and modular), and its applications to international varieties of corporate firms across Anglo-American, Japanese, German, Silicon Valley, and Chinese systems, as well as to a comparative assessment of nuclear power disasters (Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima). These two viewpoints on corporate firms: a game-theoretic approach to corporate governance and information systemic approach to the internal structure of corporate firms are synthesized in Aoki's 2008 Clarendon Lectures, "Corporations in Evolving Diversity". Relying on a recent development of potential game theory, he also showed that sufficient and necessary conditions for corporate stakeholders with different payoff functions to behave as if they have a common objective is that they share a common distributive value (technically represented as Shapley value). This insight places the economic theory of the firm in a broader frame of institutional analysis.
Career.
Besides authoring five books, Aoki has been active in organizing international research projects on various institutional topics and has edited more than ten books for institutions such as the World Bank and the International Economic Association, to which more than 200 scholars from more than 20 countries contributed.
Aoki was President of the Japanese Economic Association from 1995 to 1996, and President of the International Economic Association from 2008 to 2011. He is also a Fellow of the Econometric Society.
Aoki served as President of the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI), where he stressed the necessity of a trans-disciplinary approach to public policy research.

Jeri Redcorn

Jereldine "Jeri" Redcorn (born 1939) is an Oklahoman artist who single-handedly revived traditional Caddo pottery.
Background.
Jereldine Redcorn was born on 23 November 1939 at the Indian Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her father was Caddo, and her mother was Potawatomi. Redcorn grew up in Colony, Oklahoma, living with on her Caddo grandmother Francis Elliot's allotment lands. Her tribal name is Bah-ha Nutte, meaning "River Woman." She graduated from Colony High School, then earned a bachelor of science degree from Wayland Baptist University in Plainview, Texas and her masters degree from the Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania.
Revival.
In 1991, Redcorn and fellow members of the Caddo Cultural Club visited the Museum of the Red River in Idabel, Oklahoma. There they saw hundreds of precontact Caddo pots, which even the tribal elders were completely unfamiliar with. "That day we were so excited that we decided as a group, as a tribe, we would learn how to do it and make Caddo pottery once again," Redcorn said. Her brother taught her the basics of coiled pottery. With extreme difficulty, she learned burnishing and engraving techniques.
Artwork.
In 1991, Redcorn began experimenting and teaching herself how to make pottery using traditional Caddo methods, which involve coiling the clay and incising for decoration. She uses metal or bone tools to incise her pots with ancestral Caddo designs and hand fires them, instead of using a commercial kiln. To add color, she rubs red clay into the incised designs.
Collections.
Redcorn's pottery is found in several public collections, including the following:
In 2009, First Lady Michelle Obama displayed a pot by Jeri Redcorn, "Intertwining Scrolls", in the White House.
Personal life.
Redcorn is married to Charles Redcorn, an Osage Nation author. Together, they live in Norman, Oklahoma.

FlixMix

FlixMix is a puzzle game developed and published by Celeris, Inc. The game focuses on solving jigsaw-like puzzles with animated images.
Gameplay.
The object of the game is to place all the rectangular pieces into the correct positions. Puzzle pieces can be varied in size to as few as 2x2 to over 10x10, depending on the puzzle. Additional options to increase difficulty include mirrored or flipped pieces, locking correctly placed pieces, blanking placed pieces after a time delay, and occasionally playing the video clip in reverse.
There are four game modes in FlixMix. In "Single Mingle", the player has unlimited time to solve a single puzzle. In "Scramblecade", the player rotates through all the puzzles in a tileset, with the pieces shrinking in size each round. The player has a time limit, which can be extended by placing pieces, placing pieces in bonus spaces worth extra time and points, and solving puzzles. In "Joint Venture", up to nine players take turns solving a sequence of puzzles with the winner being the one to solve the most puzzles within a time limit. In "Mix'n'Match", up to nine players take turns solving the same puzzle in sequence, with the player with the lowest time declared the winner.
Tilesets.
The puzzles are divided into two tilesets of nine puzzles each. Each puzzle has its own background music. In the shareware version, only the first puzzle in each tileset is playable, though all puzzles can be viewed by watching a gameplay demo.

It is sited with its facade on the "Riva degli Schiavoni" facing the lagoon, a short promenade from the Doge's Palace. Historically, it is remembered as the church associated with Vivaldi and his young female musicians, orphans in the custody of the Ospedale della Pietà.
History.
The present church was built from 1745-1760 adjacent to the site of an earlier church, and adjacent to the orphanage and hospital, the Ospedale della Pietà. The design was by Giorgio Massari, but its facade remained incomplete, with marble facing only rising a third of the way up the columns. In 1906, when it was completed sans the originally projected three statues on the roof. Only a single simple cross ornaments the center. Above the entrance is a large bas-relief representing "Charity" (1800) by Marsili.
The interior is oval. The ceilings were frescoed by Tiepolo depicting "Strength and Peace" and "Triumph of Faith", flanked by angelic musicians, while the presbytery was painted by the same artist with the theological Virtues, (1745-1755). Tiepolo was aided by Jacopo Guarana, the pupil of Sebastiano Ricci who had originally made designs for the frescoes.
A chapel by Giovanni Maria Morlaiter with a precious tabernacle decorated with gilded bronze figures and, at the sides, the Archangels Gabriel and Michael. The altar-piece, representing the Visitation, was begun by Giambattista Piazzetta and, on his death, finished by his disciple, Giuseppe Angeli. In the choir above the main entrance door there is a painting depicting "Jesus in Simon’s house" (1544) by Alessandro Bonvicino, called the Moretto da Brescia. In the side altars there are paintings by Maggiotto, Giuseppe Angeli, and Angelo Marinetti.

AutoExpreso

AutoExpreso () is an electronic toll collection system used on most tollways in Puerto Rico. The system uses passive transponders (similar to SunPass Mini in Florida) where payment status is indicated by a light at the toll plazas. "AutoExpreso" transponders can be replenished at Texaco, Puma, and Total stations in Puerto Rico or at designated replenishment lanes at select toll plazas.
In 2012, "AutoExpreso" became the exclusive form of payment on most of Puerto Rico's tollways, with cash no longer being accepted. However, cash is still accepted on PR-5 and PR-22 due to the privatization of those tollways.
"AutoExpreso" is not interoperable with other electronic toll collection systems outside Puerto Rico (such as E-ZPass in the northeastern United States or SunPass in Florida).

Miss Lupita project

Miss Lupita is a project based in Mexico City with the aim of reviving the traditional craft of Lupita dolls. The dolls originated in the late 18th and early 19th century as a way to cheaply copy more expensive imported dolls for poorer families. The dolls are made from a very hard form of papier-mâché called “cartonería” which is also used to create alebrijes and skeletal figures for Day of the Dead. However, the craft has waned with the only workshops making and selling them located in Celaya in the state of Guanajuato, mostly as collector’s items. The project’s aim was to create more contemporary designs through a series of free workshops to the public. The resulting dolls have been displayed in Mexico City, Japan and Portugal and featured in a number of Mexican publications.
Lupita dolls.
Miss Lupita is named after “Lupita” (diminutive for Guadalupe) dolls. These are hard papier-mâché dolls with origins in the late colonial to early Independence period, created by poorer families to imitate more expensive imported dolls from Spain.
The papier-mâché technique is properly called cartonería, making a very hard surface when dry. The body and head are made separate from the limbs, which are attached with cords in order to allow them to move. This technique has been used to make a number of crafts up to this day, most notably to make alebrijes and skeletal and other figures for Day of the Dead. However, Lupita dolls have lost popularity. Today they are made and sold only in workshops in Celaya in the state of Guanajuato, often as collectors’ items.
Workshops in Mexico City.
The Miss Lupita project was initiated in Mexico City in 2010, with the aim being the revitalization of the craft of making dolls. The name is based on the Mexico City name for the dolls (in Celaya they are simply called cartonería dolls). The base of the project would be to introduce new and contemporary designs based on urban culture through workshops in Mexico City.
The project was initiated by Carolina Esparragoza in January 2010, who continues to run it. Carolina Esparragoza was born in Mexico City in 1977. She is a graduate of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda".Aside from the Miss Lupita project, she has worked on video and art object projects as part of groups such as Malestares and La misma historia. She has exhibited her work in Mexico and the United States. 
The project was initially sponsored by the Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes (FONCA). The project has also included the collaboration of artist Maria Eugenia Chellet, artisan Carlos Derramadero and writer Ana Clavel. Six free workshops were held in different parts of Mexico City in 2010 and 2011 with the only requirement being the attendance at all six. The workshops consisted of the history of the dolls along with how to make them. The workshops had over 100 participants with men and women between 12 and 71 years of age. They included professionals, artists, artisans, housewives, students and professionals. One participant traveled from Maravatío, Michoacán to attend.
The resulting 134 dolls have dimensions of about 45x16x15cm and took on average 25 hours to complete. Designs included dancers, lucha libre figures, mermaids, Godzilla figures, ladies-of-the-night, goddesses, cats as well as one made in the images of famous women in Mexico. The dolls were given names such as Siempre Viva, Hanami, La Memoria, Lupita Pecadora, Lupita Auxiliadora, Amalia, Gena, Adela, Encanto, Lupe la Brava and Andy.(mktokyo) Andy is a homage to Andy Warhol.
The resulting dolls were initially exhibited in different cultural centers in the city: Centro Cultural Casa Talavera, the Comunidad Barros Sierre and the Centro Cultural Teatro del Pueblo, Foro Cultural Antigua Fábrica Textil El Águila. An exhibition of 20 dolls was held in Mexico City in September 2011 at the lobby of the Salón Digna Ochoa at the headquarters of the Comisión de Derechos Humanos del Distrito Federal. The José María Velasco Gallery named the project its Piece of the Month, exhibiting five of the dolls. "Beauty contests" were also held featuring the dolls and winners appeared in publications such as Artes de México, Arqueología Mexicana, Culturas Populares and others from CONACULTA, the those of the Universidad Autónoma de la Ciudad de México and Mexico City Secretary of Culture.
International exhibitions and workshops.
In 2011, the Miss Lupita project was invited to visit Japan as a cultural exchange. This included an exhibit at the Sokei Academy and the Sagio-Plaza Gallery, workshops and a talk given at Tokyo Zokei University. The first exhibition was at the Sagio-Plaza Gallery in Sengawa, Tokyo with twelve Lupitas, eleven made at the Mexico City workshops and one made at a traditional workshop in Celaya. It was followed by a second exhibition of five Lupitas as part of a larger exhibition called México Chido.
The workshops were nearly canceled as a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but after meetings with officials it was decided to continue but at a later date. Participants in the workshops were originally to be giving Mexican traditional shopping bags as gifts, but instead it was decided that these would be sold for a nominal fee, with the proceeds going to the Japanese Red Cross. In November 2011, five workshops were given in Tokyo similar to those given in Mexico City. There were almost sixty participants in the workshops ranging from 25 to 55 years of age and included artists, students and workers who made a total of 59 dolls. Thirteen of the resulting dolls were displayed along with traditional Japanese dolls at the ATLIA Kawaguchi Art Gallery.
The success of the visit in Japan prompted an invitation to the Museo do Brinquedo or Sintra Toy Museum in Portugal sponsored by the Mexican embassy in Portugal. This museum has a collection of over 40,000 toys collected over 50 years by João Arbués Moreira and is one of the most important in the world. The exhibit of four traditional style Lupita dolls from Celaya and eighteen from the 2010 workshops were on display from late 2011 to early 2012.
The trips abroad were sponsored by Fundación BBVA Bancomer, the Dirección General de Cooperación Educativa y Cultural, the Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores and the Mexican embassy in Japan.

Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church

Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church in Pine Creek, Wisconsin, referred to in Polish as "Kościół Najświętszego Serca Pana Jezusa i Świętego Wacława," is a historic church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of La Crosse. It is known simply as Sacred Heart.
History of Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Parish.
The congregation dates back to 1862, when the Kaszubian Polish and the Bohemian families settling in Pine Creek united to practice their faith in the absence of any nearby Roman Catholic parish. On February 7, 1864, a parish was formally established and dedicated to Saint Wenceslaus, in honor of the parish's Bohemian contingent. Despite the Bohemian name, the parish was predominantly Polish and was served by Polish-speaking priests. In all likelihood, the parish's predominance of Kaszubian Poles led to the addition of "Sacred Heart" to the church's name, recognizing a devotion particularly dear to Poles.
The first permanent pastor was the Reverend Florentine Zadzioski, who arrived in 1866. Until roughly the turn of the century, pastors came and went frequently. As Polonia expanded, Polish-speaking priests were in high demand, and not every priest could flourish in a rustic setting like Pine Creek. The arrival of the Reverend Jakob W. Gara as pastor on June 10, 1904 marked the beginning of an era for Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus. Although he ruled the parish with an iron hand, as was expected of Roman Catholic pastors in those days, he was genuinely beloved by his flock. One anecdote relates that Reverend Gara was known to appear in the local saloons and buy the patrons (all of whom were his parishioners) a round. He died, worn out from his efforts at the comparatively young age of 62, on December 29, 1937. His funeral on January 3, 1938, was attended by more than 1,500 mourners. After Reverend Gara's death, the parish was pastored by Polish-speaking priests well into the 1960s.
Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church.
The original Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church, a small frame building, was constructed shortly after the parish's formal establishment in 1864. It stood on top of the hill, overlooking the location of the current church. On May 10, 1875, a new pastor, the Reverend Adolf Snigurski, began construction of the present church. This church was designed by C.G. Maybury of Winona, who later designed the Basilica of Saint Stanislaus Kostka in Winona, Minnesota. On November 12, 1875, it was completed and dedicated. Combined with the rectory, the parish school building, and the convent built for the nuns who taught at the parish school, the church literally dominated the hamlet of Pine Creek. As the "Winona Republican Herald" commented in reporting on Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus's fiftieth anniversary celebration, the church was truly a village in itself.
As with other similar Roman Catholic churches in the area, Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Church underwent numerous changes made for structural and for liturgical reasons. Most recently, the entire church has been renovated in a way selected to recall as much as possible the original configuration from 1875. This "restoration" is particularly appropriate seeing that Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus will be celebrating its 150th anniversary in the fall of 2012.
Sacred Heart-Saint Wenceslaus Parish School.
The Saint Wenceslaus-Sacred Heart faith community set great store by education from the very start. Religious instruction came first, of course, and a public school existed in Pine Creek from the mid-1870s on and off until 1946. But it was important that the children’s formal education also be grounded in Roman Catholic beliefs and values. Building a school was the easy part: a brick schoolhouse was completed in 1890 for the handsome sum of $3,000. The challenge was to find suitable teachers. By 1890, teaching Sisters were in great demand – and short supply. Fortunately, the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi (OSF), from Saint Francis, Wisconsin, came to Pine Creek in 1898. 
The school was expanded to four rooms in 1906, with instruction in both Polish and English. Sometimes one nun would teach two or even three grades in one classroom, but it was nothing the good Sisters could not handle. There was a tradition that public school students aged twelve and thirteen – that is, of Confirmation age – would attend the Catholic school for a year to complete their religious education. In 1949 the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis came from Stevens Point, Wisconsin to take up teaching duties. A modern combination of school and convent, built on land donated by the Kujak family, was dedicated on November 10, 1961. The school closed down in 1976 but the building still serves as the rectory.

Drosophila synthetica refers to a genetically engineered population of the fruit fly "Drosophila melanogaster". This population was created under laboratory conditions such that it is morphologically and genetically different enough from its wild type to be a separate species. "D. synthetica" has small white eyes and strongly veined wings and is unable to hybridize with "D. melanogaster". This population was created in 2012 by the Spanish geneticist Eduardo Moreno, working at the University of Bern.
Features.
"D. synthetica" is morphologically similar to "D. melanogaster" but differs by having smaller eyes with no red pigments and more strongly veined wings.
Reproduction.
"D. synthetica" are fertile and able to produce viable offspring. Hybrids of "D. synthetica" and "D. melanogaster" die early in their pupal stage and are unable to develop into adults. Therefore, the populations of "D. synthetica" and "D. melanogaster" are reproductively isolated.

The Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City Low (FCI Forrest City Low) is a low-security United States federal prison for male inmates in Arkansas. A satellite prison camp adjacent to the facility houses minimum-security male offenders. It is part of the Forrest City Federal Correctional Complex (FCC Forrest City) and is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice. 
FCC Forrest City is located in eastern Arkansas, 85 miles east of Little Rock and 45 miles west of Memphis, Tennessee. It is located in the southwest portion of Forrest City.
Facility and programs.
FCI Forrest City opened in April 1997. Inmates are housed in dormitories with cubicles. Educational opportunities include GED, ESL, continuing education and parenting courses. Career counseling and vocational training are also available, as well as a drug treatment program. A federal industries program, known as UNICOR, employs 300 inmates and produces a furniture line called "Harmony." All inmates at FCI Forrest City are required to perform a job assignment, including cleaning services, clerical duties, masonry, plumbing, painting, landscaping and welding.
In media.
On October 10, 2013, FoxNews.com reported on how the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 was effecting employees at FCI Forrest City. Citing a story from WMC-TV, prison employees were unsure when the next time they would receive a paycheck amid the shutdown, but the inmates are continuing to get paid for jobs like landscaping. The report said that the inmates are still receiving checks because their funds come out of a trust fund that is not affected by the problems in Washington. About 600 workers at FCI Forrest City are impacted by the slimdown, the report said. “The inmates who have committed the crimes in this country and are incarcerated by violating the laws of common society, they’re not affected by the shutdown, but the employees that we trust to keep our communities safe are,” Jeff Roberts, a prison employee who goes to work every day and does not get paid, told the station. Roberts added that there was concern among employees that they would be unable to pay bills.

Sharon Female College was a female seminary, founded in 1837 in Sharon, Mississippi.
When the school was first created, it was run by Methodist, Presbyterian, and Baptist churches. It comprised a school for men; Sharon College, and a school for women; Sharon Female Academy. By 1843 Sharon College had closed down and the school was under the control of the Mississippi Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. It was reincorporated as "Sharon Female College" in February, 1846. The school averaged over 90 students per year, but most did not graduate.
The college survived the Civil War, but declined quickly after the war ended due to the economic stresses that had been put on the region. Its last class, of only three students, graduated in the Spring of 1872. By the end of 1873 the college had closed its doors.

Nestor of Laranda

Lucius Septimius Nestor () of Laranda in Lycaonia was a Greek poet who lived during the late-second and early-third centuries AD. He composed learned poetry on a variety of subjects in the tradition of Hellenistic poets like Nicander and Parthenius of Nicaea, but his "magnum opus" was perhaps the lipogrammatic "Iliad", a work which would have been a showpiece for his poetic virtuosity and knowledge of Homeric scholarship. Although his fame was great during his lifetime, little survives of Nestor’s poetry today, but its influence may be recognized in Nonnus' "Dionysiaca", which appears also to have drawn upon the work of Nestor's son Peisander.
Works.
The "Suda" attributes two poems to Nestor by name, a lipogrammatic "Iliad" (, "Iliàs leipográmmatos") and a "Metamorphoses" (), and notes that Nestor also wrote other poems. Several verbatim fragments of the "Metamorphoses" are transmitted in the "Greek Anthology". No fragments of the "Ilias leipogrammatos" survive, but the poem will have concerned the Trojan War much like Homer's "Iliad", with at least one notable difference: the letter denoting each book's number would not have been used in its text; the first book, for example, would not include the letter alpha () which was used to denote the numeral 1. Two works of medical didactic poetry are also attested for Nestor by the "Geoponica": the "Alexicepus" (, "Alexíkēpos"), or "Garden of Defence", and 
"Panacea" (, "Panákeia"). The "Alexicepus" will have belonged to the tradition of Nicander's "Alexipharmaca".
An "Alexandreiad" (, "Alexandreiás"), attributed to a "Nestor" by Stephanus of Byzantium, who cited the poem for toponyms, was probably the work of this poet. If so, the poem might have been composed in honor of Alexander Severus, though Jacoby thought the Alexander of the title to be Alexander the Great.

Peisander of Laranda

Peisander (, "Peísandros") of Laranda was a Greek poet who flourished during the reign of Alexander Severus (222–235 AD). He wrote a sixty-book epic called the "Heroikai Theogamiai" (, "Heroic Marriages of the Gods") which, like the poetry of his father Nestor of Laranda, appears to have influenced Nonnus' "Dionysiaca". Peisander's poem, of which only small fragments survive as quotations in other authors, amounted to "a comprehensive epic on world history". Among the extant fragments there is mention of Io, Cadmus and the Argonauts, but the most significant fragment is the testimony of Macrobius that states that Peisander's history of the world began from the marriage of Zeus and Hera.

M.A.S.K.

M.A.S.K. is a media franchise created by Kenner.
The main premise revolved around the fight between an underground task force called M.A.S.K. (Mobile Armored Strike Kommand) against a criminal organization called V.E.N.O.M. (Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem). After its initial launch in 1985, the franchise spawned a variety of products, including four series of action figures, an animated television series, video games and comics.
History.
M.A.S.K. was developed by Kenner in 1985, along with an animated television series to help with toy merchandising. The animated series debuted the same year and ran for two seasons (1985 to 1986). It focused mostly on toys released during the first two series of the toyline.
From 1987 to 1988, Kenner released two additional series of toys. However, these last two series strayed from the original theme of the series of crime-fighting and terrorism, focusing instead on a racing theme.
Action figures (1985-1988).
The M.A.S.K. toyline ran from 1985 to 1988, releasing four official series through those years. Each series featured a group of common vehicles with the ability to transform into combat, armored vehicles. Most vehicles came with one or two drivers, and each character had a mask with a certain ability.
The first two series focused on a premise of crime-fighting between the M.A.S.K. team and the V.E.N.O.M. criminal organization. The last two series changed the premise to a racing-oriented theme, albeit still with the two teams competing against each other.
All series were produced and distributed by Kenner.
Cartoon series (1985-1986).
Debuting in 1985, the M.A.S.K. animated series followed the original premise where M.A.S.K., a law enforcement task force led by Matt Trakker, fought against V.E.N.O.M., a criminal organization led by Miles Mayhem. The series ran for two seasons (from 1985 to 1986) with a total of 75 episodes aired. It was produced by DIC Enterprises, Inc.
The animated series originally aired on the USA Network. It featured the voice talents of Doug Stone and Brendan McKane, among others.
Other media.
Comics.
The first M.A.S.K. comics were three mini-comics produced by Kenner that were packaged with the vehicles from the first series of toys in 1985. After the success of the franchise, DC Comics picked up the rights and produced a special insert which appeared in several comic books dated September 1985. A four-issue miniseries was begun in December 1985. This was soon followed by a regular series of comics that lasted nine issues. Two M.A.S.K. Annual comics were produced as well (1986 and 1987).
These DC Comics were reprinted in the United Kingdom in Fleetway's M.A.S.K. comic magazine, initially published fortnightly before moving to a weekly pattern, which later included brand new adventures produced by British writers and artists. This weekly title lasted 80 issues before merging with the second incarnation of Eagle.
In 2011, a re-imagined M.A.S.K. version was presented at the New York Comic Con by Hasbro Toys. This new version still featured Matt Trakker as the leader of the team. However, M.A.S.K. is presented as a rogue quasi-law enforcement agency battling corruption in Detroit, instead of fighting against V.E.N.O.M. Trakker himself is a police officer instead of a wealthy philanthropist. The rest of the team was different as well. This new version was written by former IDW comics senior editor and current Hasbro in-house writer, Andy Schmidt.
Video games.
Beginning in 1987, British software house Gremlin Graphics released a trilogy of computer games based on the M.A.S.K. franchise for various 8-bit computer formats.
The first game, "MASK I", was a vertically-viewed 2D game in which the player controls the Thunderhawk vehicle. The premise of the game is that VENOM have propelled Boulder Hill into a time vortex, and the player must rescue the other members of the MASK team by collecting and re-assembling parts of a scan key which then directs the player to the location of the missing personnel. The game received mostly favorable reviews in the computer game press of the time, although it was noted by some that the tie-in to the franchise was quite tenuous and only the graphics, rather than the storyline and gameplay, connected it to the M.A.S.K. franchise.
The second game, "MASK II", also released in 1987, was a 2D horizontal scrolling shoot-em-up. The game featured many more of the MASK vehicles, and included a selection process in which the player must choose which vehicles to use before the game begins. Only one vehicle could be controlled at a time but these could be quickly interchanged. Again, the game was received favorably in the press, noting that it was a better tie-in to the franchise than the first because it featured more of the vehicles.
The final game in the trilogy "MASK III – Venom Strikes Back" was released in 1988 and was a 2D horizontal shoot-em-up. The premise of the game is that VENOM have kidnapped Scott Trakker and are holding him on the moon. The player controls Matt Trakker (unrecognizable in a space suit with helmet) through a series of static screens featuring platform puzzles and obstacles which must be overcome using the powers of the various masks. The player can hold up to four masks at a time, but can only use the power of one at a time. The masks can also be exchanged at certain points in the game. This game received the best reviews of the trilogy, despite the deviation from the franchise's storyline and style.
All three M.A.S.K. games were released for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC formats, while the second and third games were also released for the MSX format.

Zera Luther Tanner

Zera Luther Tanner (December 5, 1835 – December 16, 1906), sometimes spelled Zero, was an American naval officer, inventor, and oceanographer. Tanner invented a depth sounding system, wrote several books on hydrography and retired a commander of the United States Navy in 1897.
Career.
Zera Tanner was born in Warsaw, New York in 1835, the son of Zerah and Ruth (Foster) Tanner. The elder Tanner died when his son was one year old, so the younger Tanner worked in family farms until his late teens, when he apprenticed to a mechanic. Tanner traveled by ship to Great Britain in 1855, and because of ill health chose to take a longer voyage from Liverpool to Bombay, India aboard SS "Culloden" in 1856. After two round trips, one as third officer, Tanner chose sailing for his profession.
Returning to the United States, after Tanner served about American merchantmen, he eventually assisted several seaborne troop movements in the Gulf of Mexico. Tanner chose to join government service and was appointed acting ensign of the Union Navy in the summer of 1862. Tanner served upon the bark and the supply steamer during the American Civil War. When "Rhode Island" captured a British blockade runner in December 1864, Tanner was put in charge of the prize crew. During the Second Battle of Fort Fisher, Tanner commanded the boats from his vessel landing Union ground forces.
Tanner entered the United States Navy in 1868, coming over from the deactivated volunteer services. Until his retirement in 1897, Tanner served the navy in hydrographic survey and dredging commands, often in conjunction with the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, generally known as the United States Fish Commission. Tanner partially designed and oversaw the construction of two ships for the commission. USFC "Fish Hawk", in service from 1880 to 1926 and the first large vessel ever built expressly for the promotion of fisheries, was a smaller vessel designed for coastal waters and was primarily used as a mobile fish hatchery although she also conducted fisheries research, while USFC "Albatross", which served as a fisheries research ship from 1882 to 1921 except for brief periods in U.S. Navy service in 1898 and from 1917 to 1919, was the first full-sized vessel primarily designed for marine research. Tanner was the first commanding officer of "Fish Hawk", and he commanded "Albatross" for many years, including transporting famed naturalist Alexander Emanuel Agassiz on an 1891 voyage to the Galapagos Islands.
Tanner developed an improved method of depth sounding, using instruments of his own design. He patented his system in 1899 as the Tanner navigational sounding apparatus.
Legacy.
Tanner died in Washington, D.C. in late 1906 and was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.
Two U.S. Navy ships have been named after Tanner. After World War II, , an attack cargo ship with service in the Okinawa campaign was re-purposed for oceanographic survey work and renamed . "Tanner" spent her career mapping significant coastline areas and was retired in 1969. In 1990, was built for the U.S. Navy as a fast oceanographic research vessel. Now named TS "State of Maine", she serves as the training ship of the Maine Maritime Academy.

Lightning Comics (1990s)

Lightning Comics in the mid 90s was an independent comic publisher founded by Joseph and Steve Zyskowski. They wanted to make comic books unlike the ones they had read before. They believed the newest comics "seemed to lack 'substance'." Their first artists were Julius Jackson, Paul Abrams, Terral Lawrence, Karl Kerscl, and Eric Pence. The first comic published by Lightning Comics, Bloodfire #1, sold 50,000 comics. The company's idea was to make each issue a limited printing to enhance collectability. Also, after that first book, Greg Weed was hired to move the company from marker to airbrush.
Lightning Comics later became the first of several publishers to capitalize on the "Bad Girl" trend in comics by offering limited "nude cover" variations of their comics featuring Hellina, Catfight and their other female heroines.

It is part of the Petersburg Federal Correctional Complex (FCC) in Virginia and operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice. An adjacent satellite prison camp houses minimum-security male offenders.
FCC Petersburg is located in Prince George County, 25 miles southeast of Richmond, Virginia, the state capital. It lies just west of Hopewell, Virginia.
Notable incidents.
In 2008, a joint investigation conducted by the FBI and the Bureau of Prisons found that an inmate at FCI Petersburg, John Leighnor, was coordinating an ongoing identity theft scheme from the facility. Leighnor was already serving a 7-year-sentence handed down in 2003 for another identity theft scheme. Armed with the names of his victims, Leighnor drafted correspondence to be sent by mail to various governmental agencies and other organizations to obtain official documentation for his targets. In connection with each mailing, Leighnor either claimed that he was actually the person he was victimizing or that he was a lawyer, advocate, or other designated representative for a targeted victim and requested the victim’s personal documentation, such as birth certificates, family information, undergraduate transcripts, enrollment applications, and death certificates. Leighnor directed that all return correspondence be sent to his attention at various addresses, including: “Dept. 14375-077, P.O. Box 1000, Petersburg, Virginia 23804.” He concealed the fact that the correspondence would actually be delivered to him at FCI Petersburg and that “14375-077” was his federal prisoner identification number.
Upon receiving the victim’s identifying information, Leighnor planned on obtaining passports, birth certificates, driver’s licenses, and other identification documents in the victims’ names for use in traveling and obtaining funds from financial institutions and individuals. Leighnor also possessed documents and made statements to other inmates at FCI Petersburg illustrating his plans to file claims with the Claims Resolution Tribunal (the entity charged with handling claims on Swiss Bank accounts believed to be abandoned by victims of Nazi Persecution) for obtaining possession of abandoned funds in the Swiss bank accounts connected to Holocaust victims.
In 2009, Leighnor was sentenced to an additional 8 years in prison for mail fraud and identity theft related to the FCI Petersburg scheme. He is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix, a low-security facility in New Jersey, and is scheduled for release in 2016.

Cultured dextrose

Cultured dextrose is a food additive used to inhibit the growth of undesirable bacteria and mold in food. Often used in place of benzoates and sorbates, it is considered by some consumers to be a more "natural" ingredient, because it is prepared by the fermentation of milk or sugar powders by the supposedly probiotic bacteria Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Lactococcus lactis, both of which are extensively used in the production of cheese and other dairy products.
Cultured dextrose consists of an undefined mixture of fermentation metabolites, including butyric, propionic and lactic acids and small peptides. As sold, it is an off-white powder.
Cultured dextrose is marketed under the tradename MicroGARD® by Danisco, a unit of DuPont, and is used in a range of foods including dairy products, salad dressings, and baked goods.

Moyale clashes

The Moyale clashes were a series of ethnic clashes between Borana and Gabra communities in July 2012 in the area of Moyale, Ethiopia, on the border with Kenya. The fighting appeared to be caused by a long-standing dispute over land possession, exacerbated by recent drought conditions.
Clashes began around 25 July and continued for the next three days. Armed militias reportedly took positions in villages, at which point the fighting spread into Moyale itself. Businesses were shut in Moyale on both sides of the border, and homes in the villages of Chamuki and Shawabarre were reported to have been burnt. On 28 July, the United Nations reported that at least twenty people had been killed in the fighting.
On 28 July, the Kenyan Red Cross (KRCS) announced that more than 20,000 people had fled into Kenya to escape the fighting. Because of lack of shelter on the Kenyan side of the border, many were sleeping in the open or under tarpaulins provided by the organization.
On 30 July, the Ethiopian government stated that the police had made arrests and the situation was "under control". However, as of that date, the displaced people remained on the Kenyan side of the border, causing the KRCS to issue an urgent plea for humanitarian assistance.

FCC Petersburg is located in Prince George County, 25 miles southeast of Richmond, the state capital. It lies just west of Hopewell, Virginia.
Notable incidents.
A joint investigation conducted by the FBI and the Department of Justice Inspector General found that a correction officer at FCC Petersburg, Keif Jackson, conspired with inmate Walter Brooks to smuggle heroin inside the facility. In 2008, Brooks recruited Jackson to smuggle heroin to him in the prison. At Brooks’ request, Officer Jackson contacted acquaintances of Brooks and, on multiple occasions, met with them to obtain heroin. He then smuggled the drugs into the prison. After Brooks was released from FCC Petersburg in 2010, Brooks began supplying heroin directly to Jackson to smuggle into the prison. Approximately one year later, on Oct. 10, 2011, Jackson was stopped by the police on his way to work. Upon searching his vehicle, officers recovered a package containing heroin.
Jackson entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute heroin in March 2012 and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.
In September 2012, a federal jury convicted Brooks, 57, of conspiracy to provide contraband to inmates, conspiracy to distribute heroin, five counts of providing contraband to inmates, and three counts of use of a communication facility to commit a felony.

DRDO Imperial Eagle

The Imperial Eagle is an Indian light-weight mini-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation's Aeronautical Development Establishment, the National Aerospace Laboratories and supported by private vendors. Its primary users will be the National Security Guard and the military services.
Design and development.
The Imperial Eagle weighs 2.5 kg and can carry either a daylight camera or thermal night vision camera. It was designed to be carried in soldier’s backpack, be hand-launched and recoverable through a soft landing. It is completely autonomous and can be programmed with navigational way-points, which can be changed in-flight by the ground control. With a ground tracker system, it is capable of providing continuous imagery of the on-board camera irrespective of the attitude of the aircraft. 
The major advantage of the vehicle is that it functions on autopilot. Its orientation can be controlled using a dedicated real-time operating system (RTOS). Further, the UAV can be tracked using Automatic Gain Control or GPS-based systems. Patrolling across the target area, the UAV will send images day and night. Zooming in over the enemy area, the UAV can carry a payload of about 250 g and has an accuracy of 1 degree.
According to DRDO spokesperson Ravi Kumar Gupta, the UAV had been tested for several years, and the program has been deemed successful after the flight tests in January 2012.
Collaboration with private industry.
Many components of the UAV, like the autopilot, thermal camera, data links, trackers and the carbon composites air-frame were provided by the private industry in India.
Operators.
The unique features of "Imperial Eagle" have already caught the attention of several premier institutions and paramilitary wings. National Security Guard (NSG), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), National Institute of Disaster Management and home department of several states have shown interest in procuring the vehicle. ADE’s senior officers have already made a detailed presentation to NSG officials.

<doc id="36571922" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36571922" title="Cantilever Magnetometry">
Cantilever Magnetometry

Cantilever magnetometry is the use of a cantilever to measure the magnetic moment of magnetic particles. The cantilevers used for this technique are about as long as a human hair is wide (100 µm) or smaller. On the end of cantilever is glued a small piece of ferromagnetic material (called a particle), which interacts with external magnetic fields and creates torque on the cantilever. These torques cause the cantilever to oscillate faster or slower, depending on the orientation of the particle's moment with respect to the external field, and the magnitude of the moment. The magnitude of the moment and magnetic anisotropy of the particle are then deduced by measuring the cantilever's oscillation frequency while varying the external field, and finding a best fit to the resultant data. 
To understand this technique, it is useful to think of a pendulum: on earth it oscillates with one frequency, while if we put the same pendulum on, say, the moon, it would oscillate with a different, slower frequency. This is because the mass on the end of the pendulum interacts with the external gravitational field, much as the magnetic moment in this technique interacts with the external magnetic field. If one were to measure the frequency of a pendulum (and the length), they could extract the gravitational field since formula_1, whereas in this technique one measures the frequency and extracts the moment.
Cantilever Equation of Motion.
As the cantilever oscillates back and forth it arches into hyperbolic curves with the salient feature that a tangent to the end of the cantilever always intersects one point along the middle axis. From this we define the effective length of the cantilever, formula_2, to be the distance from this point to the end of the cantilever (see image to the right). The Lagrangian for this system is then given by
_{v^2}-\left(\underbrace{\frac{1}{2}k ( L_{e} \theta )^{2}}_{\begin{smallmatrix}\text{Restoring}\\ \text{Energy}\end{smallmatrix}}-\underbrace{\mu B \cos{(\theta-\beta)}}_{\begin{smallmatrix}\text{Zeeman}\\ \text{Energy}\end{smallmatrix}}+\underbrace{K_uV\sin^2{\beta}}_{\begin{smallmatrix}\text{Anisotropy}\\ \text{Energy}\end{smallmatrix}}\right)
where formula_3 is the effective cantilever mass, formula_4 is the volume of the particle, formula_5 is the cantilever-constant and formula_6 is the magnetic moment of the particle. To find the equation of motion we note that we have two variables, formula_7 and formula_8 so there are two corresponding Lagrangian equations which need to be solved as a system of equations, 
where we have defined formula_10.
We can plug Eq. 2 into our Lagrangian, which then becomes a function of formula_7 only. Then formula_12, and we have
formula_16
or
where formula_17. The solution to this differential equation is formula_18 where formula_19 and formula_20 are coefficients determined by the initial conditions. It is interesting to note that the motion of a simple pendulum is similarly described by this differential equation and solution in the small angle approximation.
We can use the binomial expansion to rewrite formula_21, 
which is the form as seen in literature, for example equation 2 in the paper "Magnetic Dissipation and Fluctuations in Individual Nanomagnets Measured
by Ultrasensitive Cantilever Magnetometry"

<doc id="36571957" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36571957" title="Liwaa al-Umma">
Liwaa al-Umma

Liwaa al-Umma ( "Liwāʼ al-Ummah", meaning "Banner of the Nation") is a paramilitary group fighting against the Syrian government in the Syrian civil war. The group was founded by Mahdi Al-Harati, an Irish-Libyan who led the Libyan rebel Tripoli Brigade during the Battle of Tripoli. Harati stepped down as the groups leader after six months, leaving Syrians in charge. In September 2012 it aligned itself with the Free Syrian Army.
By January 2014, Liwaa al-Umma had joined with other rebel groups in Hama governorate, including Liwa al-Haqq and Jund al-Aqsa, into a Salafist and jihadist coalition called the Muhajirin wa-Ansar Alliance (not to be confused with the Chechen-led Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar).
Structure and membership.
Harati decided to form the group following discussions with supporters of the Syrian opposition during a fact-finding mission to Syria in early 2012.
According to Harati, about 90% of its 6,000+ members are Syrians, with the remaining 10% a mixture of Libyans, Egyptians, Palestinians, Sudanese and other Arabs. Harati also says that most of the Syrian fighters are former members of other rebel groups who decided to join Liwaa al-Umma, whilst others have joined as individuals. He also says that most of the Libyans are former members of the Tripoli Brigade, which received training from Qatari Special Forces in the town of Nalut during the Libyan civil war. Syrians in Liwaa al-Umma say that, compared to most other rebel groups in Syria, the group is seen as better organized and more disciplined.
Although allegedly most of its members are Syrian, foreign volunteers play a key role in the leadership of the group. The main alleged reason behind the formation of the group was so that Al-Harati and other foreign volunteers could share with the Syrian opposition their expertise and experiences fighting elsewhere.
Liwaa al-Umma and the Free Syrian Army were separate until around September 2012.
The group also reportedly has plans to set up a political wing to represent it in post-war Syria.
Ideology.
According to Thomas Pierret, a lecturer in contemporary Syrian Islam at the University of Edinburgh, "He (Al-Harati) is not a jihadi; he sees himself as a Libyan revolutionary there to help the Syrian revolution". Members of the group have described the Syrian civil war as a "people's revolution" and not an "al-Qaeda jihad".
Radwan Mortada, from "Al Akhbar" newspaper, described the group as "jihadist" but not as extreme as other groups like Al-Nusra Front. According to the newspaper, the group holds that every Muslim has a religious obligation to free Syrians from "the tyrant" and establish "right-guided Islamic rule" in the country. It also says that Liwaa al-Umma follows "Islamic rules of warfare", which include not targeting non-combatants, carrying out reprisals against innocents, or harming property or possessions.
The group's alleged Facebook page lists goals such as defending the ummah and liberating it from dictatorship and aggression; co-operating to establish Islamic governance, and working to unite the ummah and bring about its "renaissance". Mohammed al-Sukni, Liwaa al-Umma's commander in Homs, said "I would like to see Syria with a moderate Islamic government – something like Tunisia or Turkey". Abdelmajid al-Khatib, the group's political organizer, said that Liwaa al-Umma plan to transform into a political party once the Assad regime is overthrown. He said "we envisage a party that will accept all factions, religions, and sects in Syria, including Alawites, but with an Islamic frame of reference" and added, "we want to be part of any transitional government".
Funding.
Liwaa al-Umma is well funded compared to other Syrian rebel groups, with most of its uniforms and weapons having been bought in Turkey. Harati has claimed that the group's funds come from a network of private donors from throughout Syria, the Middle East, and North Africa, with several named benefactors from Kuwait receiving particular praise on the group's Facebook page.
