Rhynchinoi

The Rhynchines or Rhynchinoi () were a South Slavic (or Avaro-Slavic) tribe in the region of southern Macedonia in the 7th century. Their name probably derives from a local, unidentified river.
The tribe is attested in the "Miracles of Saint Demetrius", a collection of stories related to the patron saint of Thessalonica, Saint Demetrius. According to the "Miracles", in the mid-7th century the Rhynchines formed a "sklavinia" near the city, under a king named Perboundos. After the latter was arrested and executed by Byzantine authorities, the Rhynchines rose up and allied themselves with two other nearby "sklaviniai", the Sagudates and the Drugubites, and launched an unsuccessful siege of Thessalonica.

<doc id="36637981" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36637981" title="Lolita (The Veronicas song)">
Lolita (The Veronicas song)

"Lolita" is a song recorded by Australian duo The Veronicas, released on 27 July 2012. It was written by The Veronicas' Jessica Origliasso and Lisa Origliasso, together with Laura Pergolizzi and Toby Gad, while production was handled by Gad. Intended as the lead single to the shelved third studio album "Life on Mars", "Lolita" will not be included on The Veronicas' forthcoming re-titled third studio album "You and Me" to be released through Sony after departing from Warner in late 2013. The song charted at number twenty three on the ARIA Singles Chart.
Background and inspiration.
In 2009, after concluding the Revenge Is Sweeter Tour for their second studio album "Hook Me Up" (2007), Lisa Origliasso and Jessica Origliasso, wanting to seek creativity separately, took time off from working together. "Lolita" was co-written by Lisa Origliasso, Jessica Origliasso, Toby Gad and Laura Pergolizzi during 2010.
Taking its name and inspiration from the 1955 novel of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov, the song draws on the experiences by Lisa and Jessica, of ex-boyfriends and male music executives who would try to manipulate them. In an interview with Noise11, "Lolita" was described by Lisa as, "kind of dark – it's a little bit mysterious and a little bit provoking in a sense." Explaining the theme of the song in the same interview, Jessica stated: “To us, Lolita, is about power play... It’s the power play between genders and age groups, as well as people’s perception of taboo, boundaries, what is acceptable and what a Lolita is: She’s a bad-ass and she’s on a mission. She wants to destroy something, either her own perception of what’s right and wrong or everyone elses. She wants to prove something to herself.”
Artwork and release.
The artwork features a photograph of Jessica and Lisa's mother, Colleen, in her late twenties. After coming across old photos of her, they found there was "something haunting about that particular shot". The sepia toned picture has a curved white border surrounding the edge; in the photo, Colleen is seen standing against a blank wall with both hands behind her back; her hair is parted in the centre and sits on her shoulders and her eyes are directed to her left; she is wearing a buttoned down, long sleeve pleated shirt, underneath a short black dress; the loudspeaker to her bottom-left has a torn white patch on the grille. Above the speaker are the words "The Veronicas" apexing "Lolita", written in black and red capital letters, respectively in impact font.
On 5 July 2012, the title of the single was revealed through an eight second YouTube video. The first lines of the chorus and second verse was leaked on their Twitter account on 12 July and 21 July, respectively. "Lolita" was premiered on 2day FM on the Kyle and Jackie O show on 26 July, and the digital single and lyrics video was released the following day. The first remix by DJ Connor Cruise was published on SoundCloud on 31 July.
Reception.
"Lolita" has thus far received one review from PopBytes' Alex Nagorski. Comparing it to the grungy sound of "Life on Mars" he said it "...remains a master class in contemporary pop." He also added "It manages to not feel out of place for mainstream radio while simultaneously being completely unique and challenges the conventions of the genre."
"Lolita" debuted at number twenty nine on the ARIA Singles Chart on 5 August 2012 and peaked at twenty three.
Promotion.
Music video.
The music video for "Lolita" was directed by Spencer Susser of Blue-Tongue Films. The Veronicas worked on the concept with Susser, wanting to visually explore the "darker side of love through fantasy and science-fiction". Jessica commented on Susser's work, saying: "His cinematic presence brought to life the visual symbolism prevalent in our story of star-crossed love -- and the revenge that follows." 
The Veronicas encountered problems with their record label who were concerned about the public response to the videos concept. In an interview with James Wigney of the "Herald Sun", Jessica explained: "They were questioning a few things of the video content of Lolita... And someone piped up saying 'girls, what's your demographic? Do you think you might upset a few people?... I said, 'The song's called Lolita; - this is our personal lives, we are living this. We are not making this s--- up; we are writing about things that are close to home and you might want to rethink the single if you are rethinking the concept of the video'."
The video made its premiere on PerezHilton.com, on 30 August 2012.
Live performances.
The first televised performance of "Lolita" was on "The X Factor (Australia)" elimination show on 2 October 2012. Sung as a medley with their past hits "Untouched" and "4ever", The Veronicas performed together with the top ten contestants. The following day they performed the track on "Sunrise". They also performed "Lolita" as a surprise gig, on the Pepsi Next Stage Tour bus on 1 October 2012, in Melbourne. The song has been sung acoustically on radio for Nova 96.9 with Michael Paynter playing guitar. Performed as a medley with "As Long as You Love Me" by Justin Bieber, the chorus of the track is sung instead of the bridge in "Lolita".

Kashinath Jalmi

Kashinath Govind Jalmi was born on 13 July 1950, Indian politician from Goa, India. Dotor Jalmi ( Dotor means Doctor in Konkani ), as he was widely known all over Goa, was just not a legal luminary or a medical practitioner or a firebrand legislator; he was the most respected Dotor by a common Goenkar. Because - he was just a super fine human being.
Born to a poor family he had to struggle a lot in order to complete his education. He completed MBBS from Bombay University and was the first doctor from Gaud Maratha Samaj community.
Being an active member of the Rashtra Seva Dal, Dr Jalmi was strongly influenced by socialist ideology.
Dr Jalmi has also served the state as a minister for health, law, revenue and legislative affairs for a brief period in 1990, when seven Congressmen defected to topple the Congress government. He was the minister in the alternative government of Progressive Democratic Front that lasted for hardly eight months. The three-time MLA of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party ( MGP), Dr Jalmi was also the most dynamic leader of the opposition in the Assembly elected in 1994.
Though a medical practitioner, Dr Jalmi was always more interested in legal matters and was considered an encyclopedia of the Constitution of India as well as parliamentary affairs. He was the MGP MLA for three consecutive terms since 1984 and had won with highest number of margin of 7753 votes in 1989 election.
Dr Jalmi has however remained in the history of Parliamentary democracy with his landmark decision in 1990 that speaker cannot be part of defections. He was part of the same government of the PDF in 1990 that had elected defector speaker Dr Luis Proto Barbosa as their chief minister. His decision was later upheld by the Supreme Court of India.
Started as a grassroot level worker of the MGP, Dr Jalmi had come up from the MGP cadre to become the party’s executive member in 1980, central executive member in 1983 and then elected as the MLA in 1984 Assembly election from Kumbarjuve constituency in a 30-member Goa, Daman and Diu Assembly.
He entered active politics as the Sarpanch of Tivrem-Orgao in 1978. 
He was also the activist of the Gaud Maratha Samaj since 1976.
Dr Jalmi was also active in the sports field and was the active member of the Union Sports Club since 1968.
Contrary to his progressive views in the party as well as in the Assembly, Dr Jalmi was caught up in a controversy for the first time when he wholeheartedly supported the controversial Nylon 6,6 project coming up in his Priol constituency, at Keri. In spite of fielding Savoi Verem sarpanch and MGP worker Mohan Verenkar as an independent candidate against him by the anti-Nylon 6,6 movement, Dr Jalmi scrapped through with mere margin of 1342 votes. 
Dr Jalmi, a democrat otherwise, however was also made the target by the whole Goan media when he supported the clause in the Right to Information Act that tried to suppress the press freedom. He otherwise always remained favourite of the media with his studied views on any issue and raising technical and legal issues to counter the opponents.

Ulster Imperial Guards

The Ulster Imperial Guards were a short-lived loyalist paramilitary group organised in Belfast in November 1921 to prevent Northern Ireland being included in an independent Irish Free State. Newspaper reports suggested it consisted mainly of ex-servicemen, of whom 21,000 men were recruited in ten battalions. 
Led by Robert Boyd and William Twaddell, the Ulster Imperial Guards outnumbered the attempt to revive the Ulster Volunteer Force and held an armoury of former UVF guns in Tamar Street in East Belfast. The demise of the organisation in 1922 may have been due to a combination of the partition arrangements in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Twaddell's assassination, and the recruitment of some of its members into the Ulster Special Constabulary.

1993 Madrid bombings

The Madrid bombings were car bomb attacks carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA in Madrid, Spain on 21 June 1993, which killed 7 people and injured a further 29. The target was an army vehicle transporting members of the army. The dead included four Lieutenant colonels, a Commander, a Sergeant and the civilian driver of the vehicle. This was ETA's deadliest attack of 1993.
Background.
ETA had previously placed car bombs in Madrid, the deadliest being the Plaza República Dominicana bombing in July 1986, which had killed 12 Civil Guards. The attack came 16 months after the 1992 Madrid attack, when ETA had killed four members of the military and a civilian employee of the army and a year after another car bomb attack targeting the military had left 13 people wounded. It was ETA's first attack in the capital since 30 December 1992, when they had killed a retired civil guard.
The bombing occurred 15 days after the Spanish general election and came at a time when negotiations on forming a coalition government were under way.
The attacks.
The first and main attack occurred at 0815 on Joaquín Costa Street, near the corner of Glorieta López de Hoyos. Forty kilos of explosives had been placed inside an Opel Corsa killing seven and causing material damage to 14 nearby buildings, resulting in 90 families having to leave their homes temporarily. The second attack occurred an hour later on Serrano Street, 50 metres away, in a high security zone near the American and French embassies. It injured school children who had been waiting for their school bus. The car used was a red Ford, containing four or five kilos of explosives, which had been parked there a half hour before the attack. The exact target of the second bomb was unclear.
Reactions.
The attack was condemned by all the main Spanish political parties and led to the King of Spain cancelling his participation in the Centre of Defense Studies. In the Basque Country, a five minute break in the working day in memory of the victims was organised. The Spanish Ministry of the Interior blamed the attacks on ETA's Madrid commando, which had been reconstituted in 1991. Police sources identified María Soledad Iparraguirre, alias "Anboto" or "Marisol", as one of those involved in the attack. Anboto was arrested in France in October 2004 and in December 2010 was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

List of committees of the Indian government

The Government of India has appointed a number of committees (small number of members appointed to deal with particular areas or issues). It includes the parliamentary committees established by the Parliament of India.
Parliamentary committees.
Considering the volume of legislation to be handled by the Parliament, committees have been established to transact a good deal of the legislation. They also monitor the functioning of the executive. Parliamentary Committees are of two kinds - Standing Committees and ad hoc Committees. The former are elected or appointed periodically and they work on a continuous basis. The latter are appointed on an ad hoc basis as need arises and they cease to exist as soon as they complete the task assigned to them. 
Standing committees.
Standing committee is a committee consisting of Members of Parliament. It is a permanent and regular committee which is constituted from time to time according to the provisions of an Act of Parliament or Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business. The work done by the Indian Parliament is not only voluminous but also of a complex nature, hence a good deal of its work is carried out in these Parliamentary Committees.
Financial Committees.
There are three financial committees. 
Department Related Standing Committees (DRSCs).
There are 24 Department Related Standing Committees as of August 2012
Committees under Lok Sabha are 
Committees under Rajya Sabha are 
Ad hoc committees.
The principal Ad hoc Committees are the Select and Joint Committees on Bills. Others like the Railway Convention Committee, the Committees on the Draft Five Year Plans and the Hindi Equivalents Committee were appointed for specific purposes.
Ad hoc Committees established by executive order.

National Day Parade, 2012

The Singapore National Day Parade 2012, also known as NDP 2012, was a national ceremony held in Singapore on August 9, 2012, in commemoration of Singapore's independence and its 47th birthday. It was held at The Float at Marina Bay, five years after the event was first held there in 2007. It is also the second time that the combined-school choir was introduced to guest at The Float. It is also the first ever National Day Parade officiated by President Tony Tan Keng Yam since he took office in September 2011 and attended by millions of people and also the cabinet ministers such as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, President Tony Tan Keng Yam, the former Prime Ministers Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr Goh Chok Tong.
Theme.
The Theme is, ""Loving Singapore, Our Home"". It is to reflect on why we love Singapore. The logo also represents on how we appreciate Singapore and the love about our country.
Logo.
The logo for this year is launched by President Tony Tan Keng Yam and popularly known as the ""Orchidstar""due to its shape that resembles the national flower, Vanda 'Miss Joaquim'. The logo is usually promoted most of the time along with its language rather than the "Orchidstar" alone.
The following elements in the logo represent:
Theme song.
The theme song for NDP 2012 was Love At First Light, written by Paul Tan and composed by Iskandar Ismail. It was performed by Natanya Tan and Olivia Ong.
The parade also inaugurated the Tamil theme song for NDP 2012, Singai Naadu. Singai Naadu was written and composed by award winning music producer Shabir Tabare Alam who is the winner of the inaugural Vasantham Star 2005 competition.
NDP Funpack.
This year's "funpack" is much smaller in size compared to its previous incarnations. It is also the first time in NDP history that a "funpack" takes the same design rather than the usual various printed themes on each "funpack". Printed on each "funpack" is a unique bolded sentence in white. One such example reads, ""LOVE IS THE BOND THAT UNITES US AS ONE PEOPLE"". These sentences are displayed against a red background. Each of these "funpacks" is made from recycled materials as a follow-up to the previous year's parade.
Motivators.
Colourful costumes that comes in the form of green top, a shiny blue bottom and a blue cap has been designed for the motivators from the TOUCH Community Services. According to the designer, the cost for manufacturing the costumes has been very costly as compared to the previous years due to the special materials being used to create the "shininess" for the blue bottom. The motivators has been divided into 2 halves, the viewing gallery and the floating platform. The objective for motivators on the viewing gallery is to have fun interacting with the audiences while they do the balloon sculpting. At the very start of the pre-parade, motivators towards the stage performing a special "run-in" dance under the music Let's Get It Started by The Black Eyed Peas. Upon the end of the dance, they quickly jogged onto the viewing gallery to join the audiences and the other half of the motivators in the pre-parade while the Emcees were introducing themselves to the audiences.
The motivators are students that came from the following 6 institutions:
In addition to that, the motivators re-appeared right in front of the stage during the grand finale, forming up in rows with each of them holding a lighted torch on their left hand while performing some hands movements accompanying the past-year NDP medleys while audiences and participants sing along with it under the colourful pyrotechnics. They had also ushered off the President Tony Tan Keng Yam as he made his leave inside his car.
Parade & ceremony.
This year, in commemoration of NS45, an Advance-in-Review Order drill will be performed by the parade for the first time, with aerial flypasts and performance by the Police Coast Guard and Naval Divers on boats, as a salute to NS45. Traditional delights such as the march-past and the feu-de-joie will also be performed, plus the Majulah Moment (the raising of the Flag of Singapore) by SAF NSmen and veterans, the unique floating 21-gun salute by members of the Singapore Artillery, the Onward March to the stands from the 2011 edition, this time performed by the youth uniformed groups, and the 4th edition of the City Marchpast to Marina Bay Sands by all the marching contingents participating.

NMBS/SNCB Type 12

The NMBS/SNCB Type 12 was a class of steam locomotives built in 1938–1939 for the fast lightweight Ostend boat trains operated by the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB).
Design and construction.
The class was designed by engineer Raoul Notesse, based on the successful Canadian Pacific Railway 4-4-4 "Jubilee" semi-streamlined locomotives of 1936/7, but also incorporating the ideas on streamlining of André Huet.
The type 12 locomotives were produced for the Belgian Consortium of Locomotive Construction, by Société anonyme John Cockerill at Seraing, near Liège.
The locomotive bodies were fully streamlined except for openings to provide access to the valve gear and the crankshaft. The design included inside cylinders but outside valve gear to reduce oscillation at speed.
<br clear=left>
Operation.
The class was designed for the fast, relatively light-weight, boat trains on the journey between Brussels and Ostend to be capable of speeds of . They were also used on Brussels–Liège expresses. During World War II they were used on Brussels–Ostend, Lontzen/Herbesthal, and Lille trains. For most of their careers, the type 12s were assigned to Schaerbeek.
The class was rated at a maximum speed of . However, on 12 June 1939 one type 12 locomotive completed the from Brussels to Ostend in 57 minutes at an average speed of .
The members of the class ended their careers on the Brussels–Mons and Brussels–Tournai services and were finally withdrawn 27 September 1962. No. 12.004 had been preserved by SNCB and was brought back to running order for the 150th anniversary of railways in Belgium in 1985 but has since been left exposed to the elements.
François Schuiten, the Belgian comic book author, made No. 12.004 the central theme of his Graphic novel "La Douce", published in 2012.

Norman Frederick Hastings

Major Norman Frederick Hastings, DSO (14 July 1879 – 9 August 1915) served as Officer Commanding New Zealand's 6th (Manawatu) Squadron, Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment. After serving with British military units during the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, he worked as an engineering fitter with the New Zealand Railways Department workshops at Petone. He enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force at the outbreak of World War I, and served with distinction before dying of wounds after the attack on Chunuk Bair, Gallipoli, in August 1915. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (second only to the Victoria Cross for officers), was Mentioned in Despatches, and was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Army to receive the French Legion of Honour decoration during the war. The memorial flagstaff at Petone railway station appears to have been erected in his honour, and was the site of New Zealand's first public Anzac Day ceremony on 25 April 1916.
Early life.
Norman Hastings was born in Auckland on 14 July 1879, the son of Frederick and Fanny Hastings. He was raised in Brooklyn, Wellington, and his military service began in the 1890s when he served as a private for two and a half years with the Wellington City Rifles.
Boer War.
Hastings took part in the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, serving with British troops despite his New Zealand roots. He enlisted into 34 Company Army Service Corps on 10 August 1900. Holding the rank of conductor, he remained with the company until 19 February 1901 when he was transferred at his own request to a mounted unit, Rimington's Scouts and Guides. Shortly before Hastings had arrived, Major Frederick Damant had taken over command of the unit and it later became known as Damant's Horse. Working with Major General (later General) Bruce Hamilton's 21st Brigade in Cape Colony to drive out Boer forces led by Christiaan de Wet, Hastings gained the rank of sergeant and was wounded in action twice while serving with the unit. For a six-month period, he was detached from Damant's Horse, serving in Hamilton's field intelligence unit, during which time he commanded a group of native scouts.
Between the wars.
After the conclusion of the Boer War, Hastings returned to New Zealand. In 1905, he recommenced his military service by enlisting in the Karori Defence Rifle Club. He served with the Club until 1908 when he married Hilda May Barr of Masterton. On 1 June 1909, Hastings was appointed Commander of the Dominion Scouts, E Squadron 2nd Mounted Rifles Regiment, a volunteer unit in Wellington, holding the rank of acting lieutenant. He later passed a promotion examination and was formally commissioned as a lieutenant with effect 1 December 1909. In 1911 he tried unsuccessfully to gain an appointment to the permanent staff of the New Zealand Army as an adjutant or instructor. During a period of significant reorganisation of the New Zealand Military Forces, Hastings was instead posted to A Squadron, 6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles, which was established as a new unit on 17 March 1911. Serving in a part-time capacity, he then successfully passed the examination for promotion to captain and was granted that rank with effect 16 October 1912. During this period Hastings settled in Petone where he commenced working for the New Zealand Railways Department as an engineering fitter and foreman, and with his wife raised two children: Francis Norman and Marjory.
World War I.
After the New Zealand Government declared war on Germany it decided to establish the New Zealand Expeditionary Force for overseas service. As a part of this force, the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment was formed and began concentrating at Awapuni racecourse in Palmerston North from 12 August 1914. Hastings joined the unit in the Manawatu and was attested on 13 August 1914, enlisting into the 6th Squadron as second-in-command under Major Charles Dick. The unit formed part of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade commanded by Brigadier-General Andrew Hamilton Russell, and departed New Zealand on board the troopship "Tahiti" on 15 October 1914. This vessel was one of twelve troop ships that carried the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in a convoy escorted by Allied warships. After departing New Zealand, the convoy stopped at Hobart, Albany and Colombo before arriving at the Suez Canal on 1 December 1914. In Egypt, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force established a training camp at Zeitoun, with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade remaining behind as the New Zealand Infantry Brigade participated in British operations against the Ottomans in the Suez Canal area in February 1915, before taking part in the invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula in late April 1915.
Service at Gallipoli.
The Gallipoli landings were strongly resisted by Ottoman forces, and reinforcements were required. Thus, in early May the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment was advised to prepare for embarkation for Gallipoli to join the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. On 12 May 1915, Hastings arrived at Anzac Cove and the following day his regiment occupied Walker's Ridge. From then on, Hastings displayed strong leadership as the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment anchored the brigade's position in defence of the ANZAC perimeter. On 19 May, the Ottomans launched a major offensive that saw 42,000 Ottomans attack the 17,000 ANZACs holding the beachhead. In response, the 6th Squadron prepared to take part in a counterattack, but this was subsequently called off. After the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment attacked and seized a new outpost (initially called No. 3 Outpost) on 28 May, the 6th Squadron relieved them and began digging defences. The outpost was then handed over to another squadron who came under a sustained attack throughout 29 May and were forced to withdraw on 30 May, while the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment continued the battle without rest for 28 hours. The unit history noted that during this time, Hastings "... performed most useful and hazardous work ..." closely reconnoitring the enemy's position and furnishing "... a most accurate report on the situation, which proved of great value". As the outpost was relinquished around midnight on 30 May the Ottomans aggressively followed up the withdrawing troops until Hastings led an advance along the ridge that enabled heavy fire to be brought down on the enemy's position. Hastings' men then launched a "most effective" attack with bayonets that "... broke the Turkish onrush". The ANZACs subsequently established a new outpost closer to the existing line, No. 3 Outpost, with the position now held by the enemy referred to as the Old No. 3 Outpost.
August Offensive.
In early August 1915, Hastings was heavily involved in the Allied offensive that attempted to break the deadlock of the Gallipoli campaign through the simultaneous push for the heights above Anzac and lodgement of a new British force at Suvla Bay. After dark on 6 August the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade commenced its task of clearing the Ottomans from the lower slopes of the Sari Bair range beginning with the Old No. 3 Outpost. During this attack Hastings led two platoons of Maori Pioneers in destroying barbed-wire entanglements in the Sazli Beit Dere before the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment stormed Destroyer Hill and Table Top. Hastings' party assisted the Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment by attacking trenches in the Old No. 3 Outpost and took some prisoners on the northern end of the position. Hastings subsequently assumed command of the 6th Squadron after the Officer Commanding, Major Charles Dick, was wounded in the assault on Destroyer Hill, which opened the way to Table Top and allowed the New Zealand Infantry Brigade to seize Rhododendron Ridge in preparation for the attack on Chunuk Bair. The Wellington Infantry Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel William George Malone managed to secure the summit of Chunuk Bair in the early hours of 8 August, and took heavy casualties throughout the day until reinforced by the Otago Infantry Battalion and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment in the evening. Promoted in the field to major, Hastings commanded the 6th Squadron on Chunuk Bair on 8 and 9 August as the New Zealanders attempted to hold the position against fierce Ottoman counterattacks. Casualties were heavy and on the morning of 9 August Hastings was wounded when a bomb exploded, shattering his leg. His evacuation was significantly delayed by the terrain and congested approaches to the heights, and the dangers encountered by his stretcher bearers, but he was successfully admitted to the casualty clearing station down on the beach.
Death.
It is unclear what happened to the wounded Hastings, and there appears to have been confusion at the time as he was subsequently reported as "missing, presumed dead". Hastings had been evacuated to North Beach into the care of the 16th (British) Casualty Clearing Station, near Embarkation Pier, which had been constructed for the purpose of evacuating wounded during the August Offensive but had been abandoned when it came under heavy rifle and shell fire after just two days. As he could not be evacuated to a hospital ship it is likely that Hastings died while at the casualty clearing station and was buried in haste due to the massive number of Allied casualties. Despite his missing-in-action status Hastings was gazetted as a temporary major on 16 December 1915, and subsequently confirmed as a substantive major on 11 February 1916. In the meantime, following the evacuation of the Allied force from Gallipoli, a court of inquiry was initiated at Zeitoun on 17 January 1916. The inquiry was concluded at Serapeum on 3 March 1916, where the Commanding Officer of the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment determined that Hastings had probably died of wounds received in action on 9 August 1915. This deduction was later confirmed when Hastings' assumed burial place in the Embarkation Pier Cemetery was marked with a special memorial by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission after the war.
Awards and decorations.
In recognition of Hastings' outstanding bravery and leadership the award of the Distinguished Service Order was gazetted on 14 January 1916 for distinguished service in the field on Gallipoli. He was also Mentioned in Despatches on 28 January 1916 in recognition of his excellent service and appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by the President of France. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders: fewer than 100 awards have been made, and Hastings was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war.
Commemoration.
Hastings was commemorated on the stone laid below the Petone Anzac Memorial Flagstaff by members of the New Zealand Railways Department. The memorial was the focal point of the first public Anzac Day remembrance ceremony in New Zealand on 25 April 1916, which was attended by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, William Massey, and other members of Parliament. Even though Hastings' death had not been confirmed at the time, it is believed that the desire to commemorate him was a key motivation in the erection of the memorial. Hastings' name is also included on the Memorial Tablet engraved with the names of 446 New Zealand Railways Department workers who were killed during World War I, which was unveiled in the Railways Head Office at Wellington on 28 April 1922 by the Prime Minister.

José Antonio Echeverría (July 16, 1932, Cárdenas, Matanzas – March 13, 1957, Havana, Cuba) was a Cuban revolutionary and student leader. 
The President of the Federation of University Students ("Federación Estudiantíl Universitaria" - FEU), he was a founding member of the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil (DRE), a militant organisation that played an important role in the Cuban Revolution to oust President Fulgencio Batista. He had the nickname "Manzanita", meaning "Little Apple".
Born to a middle-class family in Cárdenas, in 1950 Echeverría enrolled at the University of Havana in order to study architecture.
Three minutes of truth.
Echeverría and his colleagues took part in an assault at the National Radio Station of Cuba on March 13 1957, at the time of a music program which most of Cuban people usually listened to so that Echeverría's anti-Batista speech would be broadcast to the whole Cuban nation. Echeverría estimated that the rioters could only occupy the radio station in three minutes, therefore he had to prepare a speech which lasted three minutes at most. Echeverría finally managed to finish his speech right at the 181st second, when he was shot to dead by the station's guards.
Echeverría's speech was mentioned in the poem "Three minutes of Truth" written by the Soviet-Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko. The Vietnamese writer Phùng Quán also wrote a short story with the same name about Echeverría's speech, and commented: ""The story about Manzana teaches me a great lesson about language arts. Even the greatest topics like reality or truth could be expressed only in 180 seconds, on condition that the author has to use his life to pay for such invaluable time.""

<doc id="36638342" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36638342" title="Nylars Church">
Nylars Church

Nylars Church () is a 12th-century round church in the village of Nylars near Rønne in the south of the Danish island of Bornholm. Originally designed for a defensive role, the solid structure contains a series of 13th-century frescos, the oldest of Bornholm's four round churches.
History.
Built around 1165, the church was dedicated to St Nicholas. The old Danish name for Nicolas was Nilaus which has developed into the present name of Nylars. The three storeys are built of fieldstone and with window and door frames of limestone. The original defensive systems are largely intact. The decorated south door is well preserved. The porch is from 1879. The church first belonged to the Archbishopric of Lund, then came under the Danish crown at the time of the Reformation. In the 19th century, it become fully independent.
Exterior.
The three-storey circular structure with a diameter of 11 metres was originally unlimed. The oval-shaped chancel and its apse were constructed at the same time as the nave. Unlike the round churches of Østerlars and Ols whose masony is supported by buttresses, Nylars is solidly constructed with walls up to 2 metres thick. Originally the church had two doors, one for men and one for women. The northern women's door was first replaced by a window in the 19th century, then completely bricked up in 1973. Measuring only 52 by 27 cm, the small window in the northwest corner behind the stairs up to the gallery is the only completely original Romanesque window in Bornholm's round churches.
The lower section of the separately-standing bell tower was probably once used as an entrance gate. Remains of the west door can still be seen in the west wall. A niche on the upper floor probably contained a door leading to a staircase as at Østerlars. The belfry is a later half-timbered addition. There are two bells: the smaller one is from 1702 and bears the stamp of King Frederik IV while the larger bell was cast on Barnholm in 1882.
Interior.
Like the other three round churches on Bornholm, the nave is covered by a ring vault supported by the heavy central pillar built of limestone from Limensgade near Aakirkeby. The apse, lined with limestone flags, has a high half-domed vault in which five holes in the shape of a cross can be seen. They dissimulate clay pots some 20 cm deep which were apparently designed to improve the acoustics. The gallery and pulpit, originally from 1882, were decorated by Poul Høm in 1973 in tones reflecting those of the church's frescos. In 1972, Høm also completed the little stained-glass window depicting a timeglass located behind the pulpit. In 1882, when the whitewash was removed from the interior, a 13th-century fresco freize was revealed around the top of the central pillar. On a blue background, typical of the period, it depicts scenes from the Creation and the Last Judgment.
The chancel was not used for defence unlike that in Østerlars. The church font, from the late Romanesque period, is sculpted in Gotland limestone. The baptismal bowl from c. 1575 is from the south of Germany. Depicting a man's profile and the inscription "Marcus Tullius Cicero", it was probably first used for affluent banquets. The stained-glass window in the apse, the work of Poul Høm, represents the resurrection with a seed developing into a plant. The carpet before the altar, titled Water of Life, is the work of Anne-Lise Kofoed-Hansen (1990).
Frescos.
In 1882, when the whitewash was removed from the interior, a freize was revealed around the top of the central pillar with the oldest frescos on Bornholm dating from the 13th century. On a blue background with red and yellow ornamental fringes, typical of the period, it depicts scenes from the Creation and the Fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Originally there were seven images but only six could be preserved.

Diving instructor

A Diving Instructor is a person who trains underwater divers. This includes free-divers, recreational divers including the subcategory technical divers, and professional divers which includes military, commercial, public safety and scientific divers.
Depending on the jurisdiction, there will generally be specific published codes of practice and guidelines for training, competence and registration of diving instructors, as they have a duty of care to their clients, and operate in an environment with intrinsic hazards which may be unfamiliar to the lay person. 
Recreational diving instructors are usually registered members of one or more recreational diver certification agencies.
Military diving instructors are generally members of the armed force for which they train personnel.
Commercial diving instructors may be required to register with national government appointed organisations, but there may be other requirements in some parts of the world.
In 1995, a study conducted on Queensland, Australia diving instructors showed that positive job satisfaction correlated with intention to remain in the dive industry and still active in their present job for the next 12 months. The same study also showed that wages were still a primary concern since it was first noted by Kessler in 1976.
History.
In 1953, Jack Atkinson, the first National Diving Officer of the British Sub-Aqua Club, and Colin McLeod started a system of training and accreditation for Third Class, Second Class and First Class Divers, which was based on the three-tier system with which they were familiar, as used for divers in the UK armed forces. This programme was developed over the next six years culminating in the first BSAC Diving Manual, published in 1959. Oscar Gugen, one of BSAC's founders, and George Brookes travelled the UK helping to set up branches of BSAC, all of which used amateur instructors to deliver the BSAC training programme within the club setting.
In 1959, The YMCA developed the first nationally organised scuba diving course and certified their first skin and scuba diving instructors in the United States.

Battle of Jianwei

The Battle of Jianwei was a military conflict over the control of the commanderies of Wudu and Yinping between the states of Shu Han and Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. These commanderies were poor and depopulated due to the relocation of resources ordered by Cao Cao years ago. Nevertheless, it was believed that Wudu Commandery still had strategic interest as a foothold for striking into further Cao Wei territory.
The Battle.
In 229 AD, Chen Shi, a veteran general of Shu Han, was chosen by Zhuge Liang to lead an army to take Wudu and Yinping commanderies, while the regent himself stayed in the staging area of Yangpingguan as a backup. As soon as Wei military mobilized, Zhuge Liang maneuvered his unit toward Jianwei County, the northwest corner of Wudu commandery. A Wei general, Guo Huai, initially had desired to attack Chen Shi's force, preventing the fall of Wudu and Yinping commanderies, but changed mind when he knew Zhuge Liang had headed toward Jianwei. Avoiding the possibility of being cut off from behind, Guo Huai evacuated the area and drew back, setting up a defensive line behind, preparing for Shu Han's further advance. The Shu regent, on the other hand, chose not to proceed farther after he reached Jianwei. There, Zhuge Liang stationed his troops and anticipated probable Wei reinforcement, which was never sent out; hence the two commanderies soon fell. Deemed as unimportant, the lost of Wudu and Yinping did not incite Cao Wei to reclaim the forfeited lands.
Since Cao Wei had relocated the local tribesmen and livestock away from Wudu and Yinping, continuing to guarding the two commanderies with troops proved to be a futile and strategically useless option - especially in light of the expedition's already-diminished manpower and rations. As a result, Zhuge Liang withdrew the Shu forces from the area, retreating to Hanzhong to construct defenses.
Aftermath.
The victory at Jianwei was short-lived, and the manpower and resources invested in it drained the third expedition too greatly; for the rest of 229 and for the first part of 230, the Shu forces could do nothing more than construct a defensive line in Hanzhong in preparation for a Wei offensive towards Hanzhong in the autumn. The diminished Shu forces would launch no further offensives until the fourth expedition in 231. 
Despite the strategic unimportance of the two commanderies, the Shu emperor Liu Shan reinstated Zhuge Liang as Chancellor as recognition for the capture of Wudu and Yinping, a title which he had relinquished in the aftermath of the Battle of Jieting.

Linguist List

The LINGUIST List is a major online resource for the academic field of linguistics. It was founded by Anthony Aristar in early 1990 at the University of Western Australia, and is used as a reference by the National Science Foundation in the United States. Its main and oldest feature is the premoderated electronic mailing list, now with thousands of subscribers all over the world, where queries and their summarized results, discussions, journal table of contents, dissertation abstracts, calls for papers, book and conference announcements, software notices and other useful pieces of linguistic information are posted.
History.
Since 1991 the resource has been run by Anthony Aristar and Helen Aristar-Dry. In 1991 it moved from Australia to Texas A&M University, and Eastern Michigan University was established as the main editing site. Already in 1994 there were over 5,000 subscribers. From October 14 through November 6, 1996, it held its first on-line conference, "Geometric and Thematic Structure in Binding", devoted to the Binding Theory and opened by the keynote address by Howard Lasnik. LINGUIST List moved from Texas A&M to its own site in 1997. Wayne State University in Michigan was established as the second editing site in 1998, but in 2006 all its operations moved to nearby Eastern Michigan University. The LINGUIST List is funded by grants from the National Science Foundation as well as by donations from supporting publishers, institutions and its subscribers during the fund drive month each spring. In recent years it has become a site for research into linguistic infrastructure on the web, and has received numerous grants from the National Science Foundation to do this work.
Projects.
The LINGUIST List has been one of the resources for the creation of the new ISO 639-3 language identification standard (aiming to classify all known languages with an alpha-3 language code). While the Ethnologue was used as the resource for natural languages currently in use, Linguist List has provided the information on historic varieties, ancient languages, international auxiliary languages and constructed languages.
The LINGUIST List has also received grants for
The EMELD project was the instigator of the GOLD ontology, the furthest advanced of the current attempts to build an ontology for the morphosyntax of linguistic data. It has also produced a phonetics ontology, based upon Peter Ladefoged's and Ian Maddieson's "The Sounds of the World's Languages".

The name "Deleči Vrh" (and the variant "Deleči Hrib") is believed to derive from the root "Delet-" as a personal or family name. The first part of the name is often cited as "Daleč(i)" (literally, 'distant') rather than "Deleči", characterized as a folk etymology. The German name "Laubbüchel" literally means 'leafy hill', as does the Gottscheerish name "Lapiechl" (cf. "lap" 'foliage' = German "Laub").
History.
Deleči Vrh was a Gottschee German village. It was not mentioned in the land registry of 1574 or in the 1770 census, and was probably originally an isolated farmstead. The settlement may have been founded around 1580 by Countess Magdalena Blagay and her son Georg. In the cadastral registry of 1825 the settlement had three houses. In 1880 it had a population of 16 people living in two houses, but by 1931 this had declined to a population of two. It was already abandoned before the Second World War, and all that remained was a hunting lodge belonging to the Auersperg noble family. A forestry official working for the Auerspergs lived in the lodge, which had a telephone connection to Soteska Castle. From June to August 1942 the hunting lodge housed a Partisan hospital. The building was burned by Italian troops in the summer of 1942 during the Rog Offensive after the Partisans had evacuated it. After the war the Podturn Forestry Works () built a cabin at the site used part of the year by forestry workers. In recent years, the building has been made available for rental and is also used for organized vacations for children and young people.
The Jelendol Partisan Hospital was located in a gulch 1 km south of Deleči Vrh. Remains of the hospital include a patients' barracks maintained by the Partisan Veterans Organization and a nearby cemetery for the wounded.

MRWA P class

The MRWA P class was a class of steam locomotives built in 1896 by James Martin & Co in Gawler, South Australia. The class's wheel arrangement was 4-4-0.
After initially serving on the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR), the two members of the class were sold in 1912 to the Midland Railway of Western Australia (MRWA), on which they served the rest of their careers.
Specifications.
The P class was basically a 4-4-0 version of the WAGR's 4-6-0 G class, and was identical to the South Australian Railways Z class, save for its bogie tender in place of the SAR six wheel tender.
Service history.
Both members of the P class were purchased by the WAGR from James Martin & Co, and were numbered P62 and P63. After entering into service with the WAGR, they served briefly on main line passenger traffic, until superseded by more powerful locomotives.
In 1912, the MRWA had a pressing need for new locomotives. While awaiting delivery of its five new C class locomotives on order from Kitson & Co., the company also purchased both P class units, presumably as a stop-gap until the C class had arrived.
Following the entry of all C class locomotives into MRWA service, the P class was described officially as 'excess to requirements'. However, it appears that the MRWA was unable to dispose of them permanently to other railway operators.
P63, renumbered as P12, continued to serve intermittently as a shunter at Midland Junction until the early 1920s. By then, its maintenance costs had become too high, and it was written off in 1929, together with P62, which had been gradually cannibalized to keep P12 running.

Speciosa

Speciosa (foaled 28 April 2003) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. In a racing career which lasted from June 2005 and October 2007 she ran seventeen times and won four races. As a two-year-old, she won two of her six races including an upset win in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. As a three-year-old she won the Nell Gwyn Stakes and then took the Classic 1000 Guineas for her trainer and part owner Pam Sly. She failed to win in nine subsequent races although she placed second in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and the Pretty Polly Stakes. She was retired at the end of the 2007 season to become a broodmare. Her front-running style and unconventional background made her a popular Classic winner.
Background.
Speciosa, a bay horse with a white blaze and two white socks, was bred in Ireland by K Cullen. She was large, heavily built mare, standing 16.2 hands high as a three-year-old. Her dam, Specifically, a daughter of the Canadian champion Sky Classic won one minor race and has produced several other winners including Major Rhythm, a gelding who won the Stars and Stripes Handicap in 2006. Specifically was closely related to Touching Wood, a colt finished second in the Epsom Derby and won the St Leger in 1982. Speciosa was sired by Danehill Dancer, a stallion whose progeny have won (as of 2012), more than 700 races and more than £13m in prize money.
In April 2005 the two-year-old Speciosa was offered for sale at Doncaster where she was bought for 30,000 guineas by Pam Sly. At the time, Sly trained fewer than twenty horses at her farm at Thorney, near Peterborough in Cambridgeshire. She was mainly known for training jumpers and until Speciosa arrived, she had never had a runner in a Group race. Pam Sly owned the filly in partnership with her son Michael and the London-based G. P. Tom Davies. Shortly after buying Speciosa, Sly engaged the Limerick-born jockey Michael "Micky" Fenton to ride her in a training gallop. According to Fenton, who has been described as a "journeyman jockey", the filly "flew down the gallops" and he became her regular partner, riding her in fourteen of her seventeen races. Speciosa was a highly nervous and temperamental filly: in her early career she was treated with magnesium in an attempt to calm her temperament.
Racing career.
Speciosa began her career by running in maiden races at minor tracks in the summer of 2005. She finished second on her debut at Ripon in June, eighth at Nottingham in July and third at Leicester in August. She was successful at her fourth attempt, winning a maiden at Beverley Racecourse by a head despite veering to the left in the closing stages. Despite the modest standard of her form, Speciosa was then moved up in class to contest the Group Two May Hill Stakes at Doncaster in September. The 50/1 outsider of the eight runners, she took an early lead which she held until the final furlong before finishing third to Nasheej. Five weeks later, she started at odds of 20/1 in the Group Two Rockfel Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket. Fenton sent the filly to the front from the start, and she maintained her lead to the finish, winning by a neck from Violette with the future Sun Chariot Stakes winner Spinning Queen in sixth. During the winter of 2005/2006, Speciosa's owners turned down several large offers to buy the filly: Pam Sly was over-ruled by her partners after advising them to accept a £1,000,000 bid.
Speciosa began her three-year-old season in the Nell Gwyn Stakes a trial race for the 1000 Guineas run at Newmarket in April, in which, as a previous Group race winner, she carried a three pounds weight penalty. She led throughout the race and prevailed by a length from Spinning Queen, although she again showed a tendency to hang left inside the final furlong. Nineteen days later, Speciosa was the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting for the 1000 Guineas, behind Rumplestiltskin, Nannina and Flashy Wings. On Newmarket's wide Rowley Mile course, the field of thirteen runners split into two groups, with Speciosa taking the lead of the larger group racing nearest the stands. In the final quarter mile, many of the runners began to tire on the soft ground, but Speciosa stayed on under pressure, and although she yet again drifted to the left, she won by two lengths from Confidential Lady with Nasheej in third. Speciosa's victory was enthusiastically received by the Newmarket crowd, who gave the filly and her connections three cheers. Pam Sly described the win as being "for all the little people" and the success of a small stable was contrasted with those achieved by the major international racing organisations such as Coolmore/Ballydoyle and Godolphin.
Pam Sly paid a £20,000 supplementary fee to run Speciosa in the Epsom Oaks a month later, as the filly had not been one of the original entries for the mile and a half race. Starting at odds of 5/1, Speciosa led until the final quarter mile before being overtaken and finishing fourth to the Irish-trained filly Alexandrova. Her two remaining race results of 2006 were a ninth to Nasheej in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and a sixth in the Group Two Park Stakes at Doncaster in September.
Speciosa remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to win in six races. She began her season by racing against colts in the Earl of Sefton Stakes and produced a promising performance to finish second to the 2007 World Champion Manduro. Her only other placing came in June, when she was runner-up to Peeping Fawn in the Group One Pretty Polly Stakes. She finished unplaced in the Lockinge Stakes, the Nassau Stakes and the Sun Chariot Stakes, all Group One events. On her final appearance, she led for the first six furlongs of the Champion Stakes at Newmarket, before finishing seventh of the twelve runners behind Literato.
Stud record.
Speciosa's first foal, a colt by Oasis Dream Vermuyden, was foaled in March 2009. She was covered again by Oasis Dream in 2009, a filly foal Specialty, and was one of the first book of mares sent to Sea The Stars in 2010.

Born in Darwin, She was on holiday in Melbourne when she was paralysed by polio at the age of five. Her family moved to Brisbane and she became involved in competitive sport through the Queensland Sports and Social Club for the Disabled.
She became Queensland’s first female Paralympian when she was selected to compete for Australia at the 1968 Tel Aviv Paralympics. She later recalled: “It’s hard to put into words the feeling of pride, excitement and exhilaration at being selected for the team to represent Australia...It was a truly wonderful experience.” She participated in athletics, swimming and table tennis events, but did not medal.
At the 1970 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Edinburgh, Cherrie won 11 medals, including five gold medals in discus, shotput, wheelchair slalom and swimming (50 m freestyle and 3×50 m individual medley).
She was awarded an MBE for her success at the games in 1971. She participated in athletics and swimming events at the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics. She and husband Maurie were both selected to represent Australia at the 1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Dunedin.

The Suzuki CS is a series of scooters/mopeds that were produced between 1982 and 1988 by the Suzuki Motor Corporation in Japan. The line-up consisted of three basic models, the CS50 (49cc two-stroke engine), CS80 (79cc two-stroke) and CS125 (125cc four-stroke). The CS series were marketed as the 'Suzuki Gemma' in Asia, and the 'Suzuki Roadie' in the UK and Australasia. The CS series was also produced under licence and sold in continental Europe as the 'Puch Lido'.
Unusually, for this class of vehicle, all versions were equipped with a very reliable fully automatic three-speed gearbox, with the primary method of drive being a chain.
The CS50 and CS80 are virtually mechanically identical, the main differences being a two person seat, larger brakes (foot operated on rear) and larger headlight on CS80. The CS125 is almost entirely different and shares very few interchangeable parts.
The CS50 was available with kick-start only (6 volt electrics), and electric start and kick start(12 volt electrics).

Piperheugh

Piperheugh, Piper's-Heugh, or even Piperhaugh was a hamlet in North Ayrshire, Parish of Stevenston, Scotland. The inhabitants were recorded as famous manufacturers of trumps or Jew's harps. The village only survived as ruins by 1837 and no remnants are now visible, not even the plantation that bore its name. 'Pyperheugh' and 'Pypersheugh' are both recorded in the 18th century.
The site of the hamlet or village of Piperheugh is said to have been on the north-east side of Woodhead Plantation, where on the road to Guest Mailling and Ardeer Mains, once called Little Dubbs (now Ardeer Steading), was located a clump of trees known locally as the Pipers-Heugh Plantation, and extending eastwards towards the crossroads. Smith records it as being located beyond the east end of the bank upon which Ardeer House once stood.
History.
The village is said to have been of some antiquity and as stated, the chief occupation was the making and possibly the playing of trumps or Jew's harps. A record of 1627 records the death of one Johana Logane, wife of a trump-maker in Stevenston. From the place name it has been suggested that the craftsmen were not only "artificers in brass and iron", but also "handlers of the harp" and probably players of the bagpipes. In the "Statistical Account" of Stevenston parish by the minister Dr Wodrow, published in 1791, the village is stated to have been composed of between fourteen and sixteen houses, standing about a quarter of a mile east of Stevenston. Blaeu's map of 1654, based on Timothy Pont's map of circa 1600 clearly indicates Pyperhauck (sic) without Stevenston even being recorded. A place named 'Pypermuck' is shown near Saltcoats. The 1856 OS map records the "Site of the village of Piperheugh" between the copse at the 'Y' road junction and the Woodhead Plantation.
In Scots 'Piper's news' in olden times refers to men unfit to earn a living who travelled from house to house begging; some played on the pipes, related interesting news events that had happened, and passed on all the local gossip.
A heugh or heuch in Scots is a dell or a steep bank, especially one bordering a river or the sea. In this context it is worth noting the River Garnock used to run along a route that included a section through nearby Dubbs and below Ardeer House; Ardeer sand dunes being effectively an island at that time.
The area upon which the village once stood is now partly developed and the Piperheugh Plantation has been felled. It is not clear what led to its abandonment, leading to the suggestion that Piperheugh was essentially an artisan encampment of gypsies or tinkers rather than a village of permanent dwellings, although it was significant enough to appear on Blaeu's map in the 17th century. Ardeer House (demolished 1968) and estate owned the land on which the hamlet stood and this would have had a bearing on the fate of the settlement. Robin Campbell states that the 'Piper's Haugh' was ""Swallowed up in the sands of Ardeer."" Such a suggestion is possible when it is looked at in the context of dry summers, such as that of 1826, when the wind blown sands from Ardeer caused havoc for miles inland.
Trumps.
The Jew's harp was called a 'trump' in Scots, also referred to as "the tongue of the trump". It is not known why the village had the apparent monopoly of the 'trumps' trade, however other examples exist, such as Stewarton for Scots bonnets, Colinsburgh for corkscrews, and Culross for girdles.
The Jew’s harp was one of the most popular and cheap musical instruments and records show that hundreds of thousands were imported from at least the 15th century. It was thought that manufacturing of the instrument in the UK did not start until the Industrial Revolution, when it was centred around Dudley in the West Midlands. Piperheugh may be unique as the only known pre-Industrial Revolution Jew’s harp manufactory.
Dr Landsborough in 1837 wrote that although the hamlet was in ruins, the spirit of the pipers and harpers lived on in the fondness that the people of Stevenston had for music.
Coal mining.
A relatively thin dislocation, gall or dyke is present in the coal strata in the area and is known as the Piperheugh Gall or Step, running in a south westerly direction from Ardeer Mains Farm towards the River Garnock; in 1798 this is recorded as the 'Piper Hugh Step'. The other dislocation is the Caponcraig Gall which is about 20 yards thick. The coal seams here were known as the ""West Field"" of Stevenston Colliery. It was important that such dislocations (barriers) was left unpierced to prevent water flowing between the adjacent coal fields. One of the old coal workings contiguous to the hamlet was called the Piper-heugh pit.
In 1798 a report recorded that the mines in the vicinity of Pypersheugh (sic) Gaw and found them to be comparatively dry thanks to the dyke not having been pierced.
In 1725 the Earl of Eglinton was granted a 57 year tack from Patrick Warner to work coal within the lands of Dovecothall and Piperheugh. In 1774 Patrick Warner and Robert Reid Cunningham signed a mutual agreement to work coal on the lands of Ardeer and Pyperheugh (sic).
Micro-history.
The Kirk Session records of April 1700 show that John Glasgow of Pipers-Heugh (sic) applied to the session for a testimonial, however this was refused on the basis of his having stolen a goose on a Sunday and that he had been drunk on the Saturday before. He was rebuked by the minister in front of the congregation and was then given a testmonial.

Newark Drawbridge

The Newark Drawbridge, also known as the Morristown Line Bridge, is an railroad bridge on the Passaic River between Newark and Harrison, New Jersey. The swing bridge is the 11th bridge from the river's mouth at Newark Bay and is upstream from it. Opened in 1903, it is owned and operated by New Jersey Transit.
History.
Rail service across the river was generally oriented to bringing passengers and freight from the points west over the Hackensack Meadows to Bergen Hill, where tunnels and cuts provided access to terminals on the Hudson River.
In 1836, the Morris and Essex Railroad established a right-of-way from the west at Orange to Newark, from where it used the New Jersey Rail Road at Centre Street to cross the river and travel east to its terminal at Paulus Hook on the waterfront in Jersey City. By1855 it built its own bridge across the Passaic. By the early 1860s, the railroad had established alignment across the Kearny Meadows and began using the Long Dock Tunnel to Hoboken.
In the early 1900s railroad elevated the line approaching the river which previously ran at grade along Division Street in Newark and built the current bridge. Completed in an earlier phase, the bridge was later shifted upstream on the new alignment.
In 1945, the Morris and Essex Railroad officially merged into the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. DL&W merged with the Erie Railroad in 1960 to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad, which was absorbed by Conrail in 1976; New Jersey Transit has operated all passenger service since 1983.
Operations.
The lower of the ninety mile (140 km) long Passaic River downstream of the Dundee Dam is tidally influenced and navigable, but due to the limited maritime traffic the bridge is infrequently required to open. Since 1998 rules regulating drawbridge operations require a 24-hour notice. The bridge is used exclusively by New Jersey Transit rail operations for the Montclair-Boonton Line and both branches of the Morris and Essex Lines, the Morristown Line and the Gladstone Branch. It is situated just east of Newark Broad Street Station, the first stop after the lines travelling west from Hoboken Terminal and Secaucus Junction converge. In 2004, NJT contracted a study to determine the condition of the bridge and to begin long-term planning for its future replacement. In 2009-2010, the bridge underwent $23 million project for maintenance and repairs, funded by the agency. and performed by Skanska

Lost Land of the Jaguar

Lost Land of the Jaguar is a 2008 British nature documentary series on the fauna of Guyana's rainforest. The four presenters are George McGavin, Steve Backshall, Justine Evans, and Gordon Buchanan. The series is a production of the BBC Natural History Unit, and premiered on 30 July 2008. It has three episodes, each 58 minutes long. The series received a Science and Natural History reward from the Royal Television Society. 
Guyana is a country located in South America, bordering Suriname, Brazil, and Venezuela. The country is known for its large, unspoiled rainforest, which is home to a wide range of animals, including the jaguar. The series documents the crew's journey through the rainforest, where they encounter the unique fauna of the region. BBC promoted Guyana as "the land of giants" inhabited by "the huge anaconda, the world's largest tarantula and giant otters." The series was originally named "Expedition Guyana", but the title was changed to the "Lost Land of the Jaguar" by the BBC to appeal to a wider audience, as a reference to Conan Doyle's "The Lost World".
"Lost Land of the Jaguar" is the second series in the BBC's "Expedition" collection, preceding "Lost Land of the Volcano" in 2009 and "Lost Land of the Tiger" in 2011 and following "Expedition Borneo" in 2006.
Reception.
Tim Walker of "The Independent" criticized the series for prosaic commentary and a lack of "spectacle." Walker praised the performance of the presenters, but wrote that despite the noble aims of the series in promoting rainforest conservation, "it doesn't always make for compelling television." Vicky Baker of "The Guardian" considered the title of the series misleading. She wrote that Guyana is not a lost land, but a "forgotten" or "ignored" one, "amazingly, considering it was known as British Guiana up until 1966." "The Guardian"'s Gareth McLean was more positive on the series, writing that it was a "captivating series from the BBC's Natural History Unit," despite the department's funding cuts. Gerard O'Donovan of "The Daily Telegraph" was impressed by the series, stating that it was "eye-popping, absorbing and at times even a little scary, this is wildlife film-making at its very best."

SpVgg Edenkoben

The SpVgg Edenkoben, formerly the SV Edenkoben, is a German association football club from the town of Edenkoben, Rhineland-Palatinate.
The club's greatest success came in 1988–89 when it won the tier-three Oberliga Südwest and unsuccessfully took part in the promotion round to the 2. Fußball-Bundesliga. The club became a founding member of the new Regionalliga West/Südwest in 1994 but was relegated the season after and has since dropped into local amateur football.
The club also made two appearances in the German Cup, in 1989–90 and 1994–95.
History.
The origins of the club date back to 1908 when the FC Germania 08 Edenkoben was formed. This club however was short-lived, folding in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War.
In post-war Germany a new football club was formed in Edenkoben on 20 April 1920, the FV 1920 Edenkoben. The new club soon found competition in town when a number of other clubs were formed which all eventually, on 27 January 1921, merged into the Spielvereinigung Edenkoben. The club joined local league football in the south western region of the Palatinate, winning occasional league titles and earning promotion from the C-Klasse via the B- and A-Klasse to the Bezirksliga by 1936. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the club had to withdraw its team from official competition.
With the end of the war all sports clubs were initially dissolved by the French occupation authorities and SV Edenkoben had to be reformed, like so many other clubs, which took place on 2 December 1945. "SVE" played once more in local competition, a situation that would not change until the early 1980s when Hans Frühbis, a local entrepreneur, took over as chairman of the club and also became the main sponsor of SV Edenkoben. His ambitious plan was to take the club to the Verbandsliga in the near future, to win promotion to the Oberliga and, within five years, a league title in the later.
After earning promotion to the tier-four Verbandsliga Südwest in 1984 the team missed out on another promotion the following year by one point when it finished second in the league behind champions FK Clausen. The year after however the club won the league and earned promotion.
SV Edenkoben's first season in the Oberliga Südwest was not a success with the team finishing second from the bottom and being relegated. Back in the Verbandsliga in 1987–88 the team took out another league title and bounced back to the Oberliga Südwest.
Returning to the Oberliga, the club proved a much stronger side, eventually taking out the league championship four points clear of second placed Eintracht Trier. As one of the eight Amateur-Oberliga champions, Edenkoben was entitled to take part in the promotion round to the 2. Fußball-Bundesliga. With two of the four Southern German Oberliga champions going up, the club came last in its group with four defeats and only one win and one draw, missing out on promotion to SpVgg Unterhaching and Hessen Kassel, as did SSV Reutlingen.
"SVE" remained a strong side in the Oberliga the following seasons, finishing seventh in 1990, followed by three consecutive fifth places in the league. In 1989–90 the team qualified for the first round of the German Cup for the first time, where it defeated SV Saar 05 Saarbrücken 1–0 before going out to MSV Duisburg in the second round. In 1993–94 the club was once more a contender for the league championship under coach Hans-Peter Briegel, again competing against Eintracht Trier, but this time the club from Trier came out on top and Edenkoben finished in second place, two points behind. It also, for the first and only time, won the local cup competition, the South West Cup, thereby qualifying for the German Cup for the following year. Facing SV Waldhof Mannheim in the 1994–95 edition, the club went out in the first round after a 1–2 home defeat.
Its 1993–94 league performance allowed the team to easily qualify for the newly introduced third division in the region, the Regionalliga West/Südwest. In this league however the club proved to weak, finishing second-last, nine points clear of a non-relegation rank, and dropped back to the Oberliga, now the fourth tier. In the Oberliga, "SVE" was not competitive any more either, suffering another relegation, now to the Verbandsliga.
Back in the Verbandsliga Südwest, SV Edenkoben became a struggler, finishing in the lower half of the table in the first two seasons. In 1998–99 a sixth place meant a slight improvement but, after a tenth place the following year the club decided to withdraw from the league to the lower amateur leagues.
In 2004 the club was officially renamed SpVgg Edenkoben and has since fluctuated between the Bezirksklasse and the Bezirksliga, currently playing in the later, the eighth tier of the German football league system.

Mahoor Scores By Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh is a book by Saman Pourisa about an old notation of Persian Music. It was published in 2011 by Iranian Academy of Arts. The title of the book is inspired of the name of the original writer of the notation Mehdi Qoli Hedayat (Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh). It consists of 5 chapters, and was nominated for the Winter 2012 Iran’s season National Book award.
Background.
Persian (Iranian) music had been merely handed down orally from one generation to the other, and Abjad system of notation was only been used in musical theories, not for the practical use. 
Modern staff notation entered to Iran about 1850AD. After that, some of Iranian musicians efforted to write the radif of Persian music using this method. 
Among those musicians, two of them managed to write a comprehensive notation. The first one was Alinaghi Vaziri, but his recordings have been lost. 
The second one which is actually the first preserved comprehensive notation of the radif has been written by Mehdi Qoli Hedayat known as Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh.

Waterman Arrowbile

The Waterman Arrowbile was a tailless, two seat, single engine, pusher configuration roadable aircraft built in the USA in the late 1930s. One of the first of its kind, it flew safely but generated little customer interest and only five were produced.
Design and development.
Waldo Waterman's first flying wing aircraft was the unofficially named Waterman Whatsit, a pusher configuration low swept wing monoplane with fins near its wing tips. The Whatsit also featured a wing mounted tricycle undercarriage and a trim foreplane. Powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Kinner K-5 5-cylinder radial pusher engine, it first flew in 1932.
In May 1935 Waterman completed a submission to the government funded Vidal Safety Airplane competition. This was the Arrowplane, sometimes known as the W-4. This adopted a similar layout to the Whatsit but had a strut-braced high wing on a blunt-nosed, narrow fuselage pod with a tricycle undercarriage mounted under it. Its wings had wooden spars and metal ribs and were fabric covered, with triangular endplate fins carrying upright rudders. Its fuselage was steel framed and aluminium covered. It was powered by a 95 hp (71 kW) inverted inline 4-cylinder Menasco B-4 Pirate pusher engine mounted high in the rear of the fuselage.
The Arrowplane was not intended for production or to be roadable but its success in the Vidal competition encouraged Waterman to form the Waterman Arrowplane Co. in 1935 for production of a roadable version. The resulting Arrowbile, referred to by Waterman as the W-5, was similar both structurally and aerodynamically to the Arrowplane, though the fins differed in shape, with rounded leading edges and swept-back rudder hinges. For road use the wings and propeller could be quickly detached. The main other differences were in engine choice, the need to drive the wheels and to use conventional car floor-type controls on the road. The air-cooled Menasco was replaced by a water cooled engine as used by most cars. Waterman modified a 6-cylinder upright, 100 hp (75 kW) Studebaker unit and placed it lower down in the pod, driving the propeller shaft at the top of the fuselage via six ganged V-belts with a 1.94:1 speed reduction. The radiator was in the forward fuselage, fed from a duct opening in the extreme upper nose. On the ground the engine drove the main wheels through a differential gear, as normal, and the car was steered by its nosewheel. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, initially as a road safety measure. Instead of removing the propeller for the road, it could be de-clutched to prevent it windmilling the engine at speed.
The wheel in the two seat cabin controlled the Arrowbile both on the road and in the air. Outer wing elevons moved together to alter pitch and differentially to bank. The rudders, interconnected with the elevons when the wheel was turned, moved only outwards, so in a turn only the inner rudder was used, both adjusting yaw as normal and assisting the elevon in depressing the inner wing tip. This system had been used on the Arrowplane as a safety feature to avoid the commonly fatal spin out of climb and turn from take-off accident but the raked rudder hinge of the Arrowbile provided the banking component even from a nose-down attitude. There were no conventional flaps or wing mounted airbrakes but the rudders could be operated as brakes by opening them outwards together with a control independent of the wheel. The cabin interior was designed to motor car standards, with easy access and a baggage space under the seats.
The Arrowbile first flew on 21 February 1937, making it a close contemporary of the Gwinn Aircar, and a second prototype with a number of minor modifications followed. Studebaker were interested in the Arrowbile because of the use of their engine and ordered five. The third Arrowbile was the first of this order. However there was little market response and the line was halted in 1938, with no more production aircraft completed. The production aircraft had several changes, some of which aimed to emphasise the similarities with cars; there was a radiator grille with a single headlight centrally above it and also car type doors and petrol filler cap.
The fourth Aerobile was completed as a conventional, non-roadable aircraft; Waterman initially retained the Studebaker engine but in 1941 replaced it with an air-cooled Franklin. In 1943 he modified the wings with slotted flaps and later still replaced the braced wing with a cantilever one, using the wing from the unbuilt fifth aircraft.
The last, sixth aircraft was not completed and flown until May 1957. It was a three seat, roadable version powered by an water-cooled Tucker-Franklin. This was cooled by radiators on each side of the engine, fed air by fuselage side scoops. In the absence of the forward radiator the nose was remodelled, becoming shorter and blunter. The fins were also altered so that the upper and lower leading edges met at an acute angle. At some point this particular Arrowbile was renamed the Aerobile, though it was not a name that Waterman used.
Operational history.
In early September 1937 the first three Arrowbiles flew from the factory at Santa Monica to the National Air Races venue at Cleveland, a great circle distance of about . The first force landed en route but the other two reached the Races and gave demonstration flights.

María Soledad Iparraguirre

María Soledad Iparraguirre Guenechea (born Eskoriatza, 1961), known as "Marisol" until 1994 and "Anboto" thereafter, is a senior figure in the Basque separatist group ETA and the second woman, after Dolores González Cataráin (alias "Yoyes"), to be a member of ETA's executive. Arrested in October 2004, in December 2010 she was sentenced by French courts to 20 years in prison.
Early life.
When Iparraguirre was a child, her family ran safe houses for ETA. As a teenager in the late 1970s, she joined the Vizcaya unit of ETA, working mainly as a courier for the group. When Iparraguirre was 20, police raided her family home and found 8,000 kilos of dynamite brought from France. During the operation her boyfriend José Manuel Aristimuño, alias "Pana", was killed, while her father fled to France. At the time, she was studying to become a teacher. Though arrested by police during this operation, she was released and fled to France. After her lover's death she became more actively involved in ETA, going on to become one of its "bloodiest" members.
1980s.
After a year of ETA training in France, she recrossed the border in 1985 as a member of the Araba commando unit. In her first action, in March 1985, she is said to have attacked police and a television crew with a machine gun near a sports centre in Vitoria-Gasteiz. Active alongside José Javier Arizcuren, Juan Carlos Arruti, and Eusebio Arzalluz, in the three years to 1987 she is believed by the police to have been involved in six killings in the Basque country, of postman Estanislao Galíndez, civil guardsman Fernando Amo, and police officers Félix Gallego, Manuel Fuentes, Antonio Ligero, and Rafael Mircientes. After the destruction of her cell in a gun fight on the border, she crossed back into France.
1990s.
Iparraguirre is understood to have joined ETA's Madrid commando unit in the early 1990s and documents discovered by police in 1992 suggest that she was in charge of ETA's "legal commandos" (i.e. those without police records). Police sources of the time describe her as "elegant and good looking", noting also that she frequented "the trendy spots of the capital in fine clothing". In 1992 she narrowly escaped arrest, fleeing to France where she abandoned guns and a car bomb. She is believed to have been involved in eight further killings within the space of two years, namely, of second lieutenant Miguel Mirando, and of seven members of the Spanish Armed Forces in a car bombing in Madrid. After 1993, with her wanted poster prominent on public buildings, she lived and operated from France. According to the subsequent testimony of ETA prisoners, in this period she was involved in the recruitment, training and indoctrination of new members, setting their objectives and providing weapons and money. She is also thought to have been involved in the attempted assassination of King Juan Carlos in 1997.
ETA leadership role.
In 2000 she became the only female member of ETA's central committee, the second to hold such a position, and one of four people in charge of ETA's military operations. At the same time her lover was in charge of the political wing. Security agents of the Ministry of the Interior believe she was a leading contender to assume overall leadership of ETA in September that year, after the arrest of Ignacio Gracia Arregui, "Inaki de Renteria".
In February 2002, at the request of the Spanish government, Iparraguirre was one of 21 people with connections to ETA added to the US Treasury's list of terrorist financiers. She was accused of being responsible for the collection of ETA's "revolutionary tax", used to fund the group.
Arrest, trial and imprisonment.
Iparraguirre was arrested by police in Salies-de-Béarn near Pau in south-west France in a police operation on 3 October 2004. She was arrested together with her partner Mikel Albizu Iriarte, known as "Antza", and their child. Although they were in possession of false papers and refused to answer questions, police were able to identify the pair by examining their fingerprints. The operation led to the arrest of twenty ETA members, captured in a series of seven raids which also permitted the seizure of a large cache of weapons, which included 900 pounds of explosives, grenade launchers, and two Russian made SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles. At the time of her arrest, Iparraguirre was wanted by Spanish police for her involvement in at least 14 killings.
On 16 December 2010, French courts sentenced both to 20 years in prison for directing and financing terrorism; after serving their sentences, they will be deported to Spain.
In April 2012, the ETA prisoners' association EPPK, endorsing a peaceful negotiated settlement to the Basque conflict, nominated Iparraguirrea, together with her partner Antza, as two of the six prisoners delegated to represent the organization in any future negotiations which might possibly take place between ETA and the governments of Spain and France.

G&amp;SWR 8 Class

The Glasgow and South Western Railway (GSWR) 8 class is a class of sixteen 2-4-0 steam locomotives built between 1868 and 1870. 
The sixteen examples of this class were designed by James Stirling for the GSWR and were built at Kilmarnock Locomotive Works (Works Nos. 49 and 54-67) between 1868 and 1870. They were numbered irregularly, and not in chronological order between 8 and 183, to fill gaps in the sequence of running numbers.
The members of the class were fitted with domeless boilers and a cut away cab. They were fitted with spring balance type safety valves, but this was replaced by those of the Ramsbottom design over the centre of the boiler.
Withdrawal.
The bulk of the class, including all the rebuilds were scrapped between 1900 and 1905 but two survived until 1913 and 1917 respectively.

Dipterocarpus dyeri

Dipterocarpus dyeri (Khmer: "rôyiëng, chhë tiël pruhs, chhë tiël th'nô:r", local name Kompong Thom: "chhieutiel chgor", name used for commercial timber and the group of trees harvested for such: "keruing", Vietnamese: "dau song nang", is a species of tree in the family Dipterocarpaceae found in Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia (Kedah, Perlis), Cambodia and Vietnam. The tree is found in lowland semi-evergreen dipterocarp forests and Schima/bamboo forests, an alternative habitat description is mixed dense forests of the plains, mainly among rivers and valleys. The tree is a climax or late successional species, which in some secondary forests forms relatively young pure colonies
. The conservation status is based on rates of habitat loss, the major threat to the taxa, though in Vietnam it is cited as having a less threatened conservation status of Vulnerable. 
In Cambodia the wood is classified as of the 2nd best category, and is in great demand for house and boat construction.
The following insects are associated with and predate on the seed of "D. costatus": "Alcidodes", particularly "Alcidodes crassus" (Pascoe, 1882), "Pempelia", "Salebria", "Dichocrocis", "Andrioplecta pulverula" Meyrick, and "Andrioplecta shoreae" Komai

German submarine U-279

German submarine "U-279" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II.
The submarine was laid down on 31 March 1942 at the "Bremer Vulkan" yard at Bremen-Vegesack as 'werk' 44. She was launched on 16 December 1942 and commissioned on 3 February 1943 under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Otto Franke.
Service history.
"U-279" served with the 8th U-boat Flotilla for training from February to July 1943 and operationally with the 9th flotilla from 1 August 1943. She carried out one patrol, but sank no ships. She was a member of one wolfpack.
Patrol and loss.
The boat departed Kiel on 4 September 1943. She entered the Atlantic Ocean after negotiating the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. She was sunk exactly a month after her departure (4 October), by depth charges dropped from a US Ventura aircraft southwest of Iceland. There were men in boats and in the water, but the Ventura could not call for assistance. Its radio had been put out of commission during the attack.
Forty-eight men died; there were no survivors.
Previously recorded fate.
The submarine was initially categorized as having been sunk by a British Liberator southwest of Iceland on 4 October 1943.

"Taking Over Me" is the second single released by British pop rock band Lawson, via Polydor Records. The single was released in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2012, as the second single from their debut studio album, "Chapman Square", and reached number three on the UK Singles Chart, becoming their highest charting single to date.
Music video.
A music video to accompany the release of "Taking Over Me" premiered on YouTube on 6 July 2012, at a total length of three minutes and ten seconds. Directed by Josh Forbes, the video features the four boys performing in a desert town, visiting places such as restaurants and clubs. The video paired each of the boys with a different on-screen girlfriend - Andy's on-screen girlfriend was played by Chelsea Turnbo, Ryan's by Melissa Jones, Joel's by Kat McCleary and Adam's by Lexi Johnston.
Critical reception.
Lewis Corner of "Digital Spy" blog gave the song a positive review stating: 
"I can stop the world, with only just your kiss," frontman Andy Brown gushes on Lawson's latest single. It's a far cry from his heart-shattering ode to a past love on debut smash 'When She Was Mine', though given the song's chart success, the band certainly have a lot to be happy about at the moment. But while the four-piece return with a more positive outlook, their ear for a guitar-pop stadium filler remains second to none. "You're taking over me/ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh/ I'm in ecstasy," they croon on a chorus befitting such elation; and with another stellar track under their worn, brown leather belts, we suspect they won't be coming down any time soon. .

List of Dinnerladies episodes

__NOTOC__ 
"Dinnerladies" is a British sitcom that was created and written by Victoria Wood. It was broadcast on BBC One in the UK, and ran for two series from 1998 to 2000, totalling 16 episodes.
The programme depicts the day-to-day lives of staff in the canteen of a factory in Manchester in Northern England, and the developing relationship between Brenda Furlong (Wood) and canteen manager Tony Martin (Andrew Dunn), as well as their colleagues: prudish Dolly Bellfield (Thelma Barlow) and her friend Jean (Anne Reid), snarky Twinkle (Maxine Peake), ditzy Anita (Shobna Gulati) and maintenance man Stan Meadowcroft (Duncan Preston). Celia Imrie and Julie Walters also appear as HR manager Philippa and Bren's mother respectively. Although the show features many other secondary characters, scenes never take place outside the canteen set, with other situations either being described by characters or (in the penultimate and final episodes) watched by the characters on a television.
The first series of six episodes began airing on 12 November 1998 and ended on 17 December 1998; the second, which had ten episodes, aired from 25 November 1999 to 27 January 2000; Wood deliberately ended the show after two series, citing the short run and quality of "Fawlty Towers" as one of her reasons for doing so. The show was filmed in a traditional American sitcom style with a multiple-camera setup and before a live studio audience. It is now repeated on Gold, and has been released on DVD. The first series won the 1999 Rose d'Or Press Award and "Best New TV Comedy" at the 1999 British Comedy Awards, and the second won "Best TV Comedy" in 2000.

Mnemonic effect

The mnemonic effect or mnemotechnic effect occurs when the viewer of an advertisement is persuaded in making a buying decision that is contradictory to the intention of the advertiser.
This can be observed especially in image advertising, in which case the viewer starts associating what he sees with the memories, recollections, and experience that have already been imprinted in his brain.
In the end the only thing the advertisement might have reminded him of, is that he is hungry (in case of food advertisement), and not that he should buy the specific food being advertised.
Not much attention has been given to the study of the mnemonic effect in advertising, but that is slowly changing with companies questioning more and more the effectiveness of the costly types of advertising they are using.
The only thing that is currently agreed upon is that the brain does actually group different information, and many associations are instantly created when viewing or remembering images, numbers or sounds.

The 2012 FIA WTCC Race of Morocco was the third round of the 2012 World Touring Car Championship season and the third running of the FIA WTCC Race of Morocco. It was held on 15 April 2012 at Marrakech Street Circuit in Marrakech, Morocco. Both races were won by Chevrolet with Alain Menu winning race one and Yvan Muller winning race two.
Background.
After Valencia it was Chevrolet driver Yvan Muller who was leading the championship, 27 points clear of his nearest rival Menu who was three points clear of ROAL Motorsport driver Tom Coronel. Pepe Oriola was leading the Yokohama Independents' Trophy.
Having made his WTCC debut at Valencia, Fernando Monje would not return to race at Marrakech in preparation for his return to the European Touring Car Cup at the Slovakiaring. Gábor Wéber would also miss the event due to financial concerns, leaving Norbert Michelisz as a the sole driver for Zengő Motorsport.
Report.
Free Practice.
Lukoil Racing Team's Gabriele Tarquini was fastest in the first free practice session ahead of the Chevrolet's of Yvan Muller and Robert Huff. Team AON's Tom Chilton was a surprise fourth fastest, backing up his performance from Fridays test session. Franz Engstler was the fastest of the BMWs.
In the second session it was Menu was topped the times, his team mates Muller and Huff were second and third once again. Tarquini was the fastest SEAT in fourth ahead of Oriola and the Ford Focus of Chilton in sixth.
Qualifying.
Menu continued his pace from the second free practice session to take pole position by 0.028s ahead of Huff. Muller and Coronel set benchmark times early on in Q2 but they had to settle for fourth and third respectively. Tiago Monteiro was tenth and looked to take pole position for race two. After Tarquini was removed from qualifying for running an underweight car, James Nash moved up to take pole position for race two. 
Warm-Up.
Yvan Muller was fastest in the Sunday morning warm up session with pole sitter Menu in fourth.
Race One.
The Chevrolet trio of Menu, Huff and Muller led away from the start while behind them, Oriola made a great getaway and got ahead of Coronel for fourth. Local driver Mehdi Bennani and James Nash collided at the first turn, forcing both to retire. There was a brief scare for Alex MacDowall when he missed the braking point at turn 5 in his bamboo-engineering Chevrolet Cruze and collected the BMW of Coronel, both escaped any series damage and continued. The safety car was deployed while the stricken Ford of Nash was recovered with the race resuming on lap three. Isaac Tutumlu crashed his Proteam Racing into the wall at turn 4 and retired. On lap 5, Monteiro retired with gearbox problems in his SUNRED León. Menu led a Chevrolet 1-2-3 with Oriola the Yokohama Trophy winner in fourth. Chilton scored Ford's maiden points in the WTCC with a seventh place finish.
Race Two.
Nash led away from pole position while Coronel jumped up from eighth on the grid to third behind Engstler at the first corner. Chilton collected the rear bumper of Monteiro and dropped back down the field. Nash had to defend well from the BMW of Engstler until the German was overtaken by the Chevrolets of Muller and Huff on lap 4. On the following lap the two leading Chevrolets demoted Nash to third, one lap further on Menu also overtook the 2011 British Touring Car Championship Independents' Champion to secure third. Nash succumbed to attacks from Coronel and Stefano D'Aste on lap 9, while his team mate Chilton retired with turbo problems. At the finish, Muller led another Chevrolet 1-2-3 in reverse of the order they finished race one, D'Aste was the winning independent in fourth place and pole sitter Nash eventually finished sixth. After the race, the stewards issued bamboo-engineering driver Pasquale di Sabatino with a 30-second penalty for repeatedly cutting the chicanes, this dropped him from 12th to 15th in the classification.

Sterculia monosperma

Sterculia monosperma (; ), also known as Chinese Chestnut, Thai Chestnut and Seven Sisters' Fruit, is a deciduous tropical nut-bearing tree of genus "Sterculia". 
Its origin is Southern China (Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan and Taiwan), but it is now a common cultivated tree in Northern Thailand, Northern Vietnam, mountainous areas of Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as Northern Laos and Shan State in Burma. 
Nuts.
The ripe nuts are edible. They may eaten plain, roasted, boiled with water and salt or also may be used to prepare dishes, such as sauteed with chicken. The pods containing them have a striking red color when ripe and the nuts are much darker —their husk or pericarpus is almost black— and smaller than the common chestnuts of genus "Castanea". The pellicle is brown and smooth and the fruit is yellowish in color.
In China these nuts are one of the traditional foods of the Qixi Festival, the 'night of the seven', also known as the 'anniversary of the seventh sister' (七姐誕). Qixi is celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month which falls on 23 Aug 2012 and on 13 Aug 2013 next year.

Slender Man

The Slender Man (also known as Slenderman) is a fictional character that originated as an Internet meme created by Something Awful forums user Eric Knudsen (a.k.a. "Victor Surge") in 2009. It is depicted as resembling a thin, unnaturally tall man with a blank and usually featureless face, wearing a black suit. Stories of the Slender Man commonly feature him stalking, abducting, or traumatizing people, particularly children. The Slender Man is not confined to a single narrative, but appears in many disparate works of fiction, mostly composed online.
Origin.
The Slender Man was created on a thread in the Something Awful Internet forum begun on June 8, 2009, with the goal of editing photographs to contain supernatural entities. On June 10, a forum poster with the user name "Victor Surge" contributed two black and white images of groups of children, to which he added a tall, thin spectral figure wearing a black suit. Previous entries had consisted solely of photographs; however, Surge supplemented his submission with snatches of text, supposedly from witnesses, describing the abductions of the groups of children, and giving the character the name, "The Slender Man":
The quote under the first photograph read:
The quote under the second photograph read:
These additions effectively transformed the photographs into a work of fiction. Subsequent posters expanded upon the character, adding their own visual or textual contributions.
In an interview with the website Know Your Meme, Victor Surge (real name Eric Knudsen) claimed that he was inspired to create the Slender Man by legends of the shadow people, the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, Zack Parsons, and Stephen King (particularly "The Mist"), and the surrealism of William S. Burroughs. His intention was, he claimed, "to formulate something whose motivations can barely be comprehended, and triggered unease and terror in a general population."
Development.
The Slender Man soon went viral, spawning numerous works of fanart, cosplay and online fiction known as "creepypasta": scary stories told in short snatches of easily copyable text that spread from site to site. Divorced from its original creator, the Slender Man became the subject of myriad stories by multiple authors within an overarching mythos.
The first video series involving the Slender Man evolved from a post on the Something Awful thread by user "ce gars". It tells of a fictional film school friend named Alex Kralie, who had stumbled upon something troubling while shooting his first feature-length project, "Marble Hornets". The video series, published in found footage style on YouTube, forms an alternate reality game describing the filmers' fictional experiences with the Slender Man. The ARG also incorporates a Twitter feed and an alternate YouTube channel created by a user named "totheark". "Marble Hornets" is now one of the most popular Slender Man creations, with over 250,000 followers around the world, and 55 million views. Other Slender Man-themed YouTube serials followed, including EverymanHYBRID and Tribe Twelve.
In 2011, Markus "Notch" Persson, creator of the sandbox indie game "Minecraft", added a new hostile mob to the game, which he named the "Enderman" when multiple users on Reddit and Google+ commented on the similarity to the Slender Man. In 2012, the Slender Man was adapted into a video game titled '; as of August, 2012, the game has been downloaded over 2 million times. Several popular variants of the game followed, including "Slenderman's Shadow" and "Slender Man" for iOS, which became the second most-popular app download. The sequel to "Slender: The Eight Pages", ', was released in 2013. Several independent films about the Slender Man have been released or are in development, including "Entity" and "The Slender Man", released free online after a $10,000 Kickstarter campaign. In 2013, it was announced that "Marble Hornets" would become a theatrical film.
Description.
Because the Slender Man's fictional "mythology" has evolved without an official "canon" for reference, his appearance, motives, habits and abilities are not fixed, but change depending on the storyteller. He is most commonly described as very tall and thin with unnaturally long, tentacle-like arms (or merely tentacles), which he can extend to intimidate or capture prey. He has a white, featureless head and appears to be wearing a dark suit and tie. The Slender Man is associated with the forest and has the ability to teleport. Proximity to the Slender Man is often said to trigger a "Slender sickness"; a rapid onset of paranoia, nightmares and delusions accompanied by nosebleeds.
Reaction.
The success of the Slender Man "legend" has been ascribed to the chaotic, ambiguous nature of the Internet. While nearly everyone involved understands on some level that the Slender Man is not real, the Internet offers up a mess of conflicting perspectives, blurring the boundary between fiction and reality and obscuring the character's origin, thus lending it an air of authenticity. Only 5 months after his creation, callers into George Noory's "Coast to Coast AM", a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the "Minneapolis Star Tribune" described his origins as "difficult to pinpoint." Eric Knudsen has commented that many people, despite understanding that the Slender Man was created on the Something Awful forums, still entertain the possibility that he might be real.
Professor Tom Pettitt of the University of Southern Denmark has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern age's closing of the "Gutenberg Parenthesis"; the time period from the invention of the printing press to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified in discrete media, to a return to the older, more primal forms of storytelling, exemplified by oral tradition and campfire tales, in which the same story can be retold, reinterpreted and recast by different tellers, expanding and evolving with time.
Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia has noted that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, the Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted, giving a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. She describes the Slender Man as a metaphor for "helplessness, power differentials, and anonymous forces." Similarly, Tye Van Horn, a writer for "The Elm", has suggested that the Slender Man represents modern fear of the unknown; in an age flooded with information, people have become so inured to ignorance that they now fear what they cannot understand. Troy Wagner, the creator of "Marble Hornets", ascribes the terror of the Slender Man to its malleability; people can shape it into whatever frightens them most.
Copyright.
Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man is not in the public domain. Eric "Victor Surge" Knudsen registered a copyright on the name "Slender Man" in January 2010. Several profit-making ventures involving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, and several more have been legally blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, it is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright has less to do with money than with artistic integrity: "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional."
Alleged inspired attacks.
On May 31, 2014, two 12-year-old girls in Waukesha, Wisconsin, allegedly held down and stabbed a 12-year-old classmate 19 times; when questioned later by authorities, they reportedly claimed that they wished to commit a murder as a first step to becoming "proxies" (acolytes) of the Slender Man, having read about it online.
One of the girls believed Slender Man watches her, can read minds, and teleport.
Thanks to the intervention of a passing cyclist, the victim survived the attack. The attackers were charged as adults and are each facing up to 65 years in prison. In a statement to the media, Eric Knudsen said, "I am deeply saddened by the tragedy in Wisconsin and my heart goes out to the families of those affected by this terrible act." He stated he would not be giving interviews on the matter. In the wake of the attack, the mother of a mentally disturbed 13-year-old girl in Hamilton, Ohio, said that her daughter had attacked her with a knife, and had written macabre fiction, some involving the Slender Man.

6000 series (Chicago 'L')

The 6000 series was a series of Chicago 'L' car built between 1950 and 1959 by the St. Louis Car Company. 720 cars were built. The last of 6000-series cars were retired on December 4, 1992. These cars were in service for 42 years.
Design.
In 1947-1948 the CTA received four three car articulated trainsets, 5001-5004, to test PCC technology in rapid transit use. Two sets of cars were built by Pullman, two by St. Louis Car, with equipment supplied by competing suppliers, in order to test them directly against each other. The 6000 series was designed with knowledge from the 5000 series.
Bodies.
5000 series bodies had a curved profile previously used by North Shore Line and then Chicago, Aurora & Elgin cars which operated on the L. The floor width was the needed for platform clearance, then above the sides curved outward, so the car was wider at seat level. This profile was used, 6000 series cars were wider at the seats than the floor. Blinker doors which fold and open inward were also successful and were used in the 6000 series.
Articulation was not repeated, the 6000s were individual cars semi-permanently attached in pairs. The outside end of both cars had a cab, making a two car double ended arrangement. This has become the CTA standard.
St Louis built all 6000 series cars, as well as the 1-50 series, many with components salvaged from Pullman streetcars.
Driveline.
The 5000s had modified Clark and St Louis trucks with wheels for speeds of x. The 6000s had more standard streetcar trucks, with wheels. These had a top speed of 50, which was adequate for CTA needs until the high speed Skokie Swift shuttle started in 1964.
The first 200 cars were built with new components, including Clark B-2 trucks, the next 310 cars had Clark B-2s salvaged from Pullman streetcars, and the final 210, plus most of the similar 1-50 class, had St Louis B-3s salvaged from St Louis streetcars.
All cars had Westinghouse XDA1 controls. 6001-6488 had Westinghouse 1432 motors, all following cars had General Electric 1220 motors. Both type motors delivered . The exceptions are test cars 6127-6130, which had non-standard equipment and higher performance.
Routes.
The 6000 series became the standard of the system, and were used almost everywhere. In 1975 there were still over 700 6000s in service.
Initially, all of the first 130 6000s were assigned to the Logan Square line. The North-South and Ravenswood lines had 6000s in service in 1952 (with the 4000-series cars taking the 6000s' place on the Logan Square line); other lines (except the Lake Street line, presumably due to width clearance issues on the at-grade section of the line west of Laramie Avenue, which was also powered by overhead wire) received cars when they became available.
Because of overhead wire, no 6000s were used on the Skokie or Evanston lines, except 6127-6130, which received trolley poles for express service on the Evanston line. (The western section of the Lake line was elevated in 1962; however, it remained equipped entirely with 4000s until the arrival of the 2000-series cars from Pullman-Standard in 1964.) Two of the routes that the 6000s were not used on were served by their single car variants, the 1-50 series. The Evanston line began to receive additional 6000s after it converted entirely from overhead wire to third rail in 1973.
When the Dan Ryan line was opened in 1969 newer cars were assigned there, but 6000s were sometimes used for special movements.

Paul Verryn

Paul Verryn (born 26 February 1952) is an ordained minister of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa and a controversial figure in the Church and society. He has been involved in a refugee crisis, has served as Bishop in the Central District of the Methodist Church, and was suspended in 2010 on the grounds that he had exceeded his authority.
Training and career.
Verryn is a graduate of Rhodes University in the Eastern Cape (B.Arts and B.Divinity). From 1973 to 1983 he served as a minister in the Methodist Circuits of Uitenhage, Southern Transkei, Grahamstown and Port Elizabeth. In 1984 Verryn was moved to what is now Gauteng Province, to Roodepoort (1984–1987) and then to Soweto (1988-1997). In 1997 Verryn was elected as Bishop of the Central District, and began serving also as a minister in the Johannesburg Circuit, where his home church was the Johannesburg Central Methodist Society.
Additional positions.
Verryn was also appointed as Supervisor of Studies (of student ministers) during the period 1982-1997, and as a John Wesley College tutor from 1994 to 1997. In 1994 he also assumed the position of:
Other positions which Verryn holds include 
In the Apartheid era.
An anti-Apartheid activist.
"Paul has said that he was 'radicalised' in the Eastern Cape, where he gave shelter to activists fleeing from the security police during South Africa's apartheid days." He also served as Chair of the Detainees Parents Support Committee during 1982-83. (South African law during this time allowed detention without trial under certain circumstances).
Stompie Moeketsi.
In 1989 a media furor erupted following the abduction of four youths and the murder of James Seipei, also known as Stompie Moeketsi. Verryn had provided accommodation as a place of safety at the Orlando Mission house (Manse) for the four. At the time this was also his residence as the minister for the Soweto Circuit. Verryn was then also prominent as one of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's critics. 
On 29 December 1988 the Mandela United Football Club (MUFC) abducted the four boys from the Mission house. The MUFC was a private force of bodyguards, who answered to and were controlled by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, then Nelson Mandela's wife and a leading anti-apartheid activist. Following the abduction, Madikizela-Mandela alleged that Verryn had been abusing the boys sexually. Some of the boys initially supported the allegation, but later retracted their statements, saying that the MUFC members had forced them to support the claim. Madikizela-Mandela also claimed that Seipei(Moeketsi) was a police informer, a charge which in those days could have resulted in mob execution of the accused. Seipei's body was found on 6 January 1989, dumped on waste ground in Soweto. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that the purpose of the abduction had been to force the boys to accuse Verryn of sexual abuse, and, after hearing testimony from all surviving witnesses and accusers, specifically cleared Verryn of any charges of sexual abuse.
The Zimbabwean refugee crisis.
The Johannesburg Central Methodist Church, under the leadership of Bishop Paul Verryn, had established a tradition of ministering to the poor and marginalised in the city centre. When the flow of Zimbabwean refugees into South Africa had been significantly reduced, the South African government removed special controls which it had been forced to put in place. However, refugees and illegal immigrants continued to enter the country in relatively limited numbers, mostly from Zimbabwe. Many of them were destitute and jobless as well as being homeless. Over the objections of some of his church members, Verryn offered Johannesburg Central Methodist Church to this need. The steady inflow of refugees soon filled the church, which lacking all suitable facilities, nevertheless accommodated over 1500 refugees who slept on the pews and the floors; anywhere they could find a space.
In 2008 the South African Police raided the church in search of illegal immigrants. About 1500 people were held, in most cases temporarily. During 2008 and continuing into 2009 an increasing tide of resentment (labelled "xenophobia" by the media) against these foreigners peaked and broke out into anti-foreigner riots. Many Zimbabwean immigrants (whether legal or illegal), together with Mozambicans, Malawians, Taiwanese and others from any other African country became victims of the violence, losing lives, businesses, jobs and The need for a place of safety for Zimbabwean (and other) refugees became urgent. The Zimbabwean refugee ark of Johannesburg Central Methodist Church began to burst at the seams. During the later part of 2008 the police found it necessary to guard the refugees with shotgun armed officers.
Verryn requested the Johannesburg city authorities to provide for the refugees, but at the same time refused to allow immigration authorities to enter the sanctuary of the church to identify illegal immigrants. Early in 2009 the local municipality began to make plans to alleviate the situation at the church.
Meanwhile, inevitably, thefts, fights and assaults occurred among the refugees. Several young girls claimed that they had been raped, or sexually abused. In the latter part of 2009, once again Verryn was accused of abusing children and/or young women among the refugees. An exhaustive investigation by the media revealed no evidence whatever to substantiate the accusations against him. All of the girls who had claimed rape or sexual assault identified men other than Verryn as the guilty ones. The medical staff of Médecins sans Frontières, who by now also worked among the refugees, stated that they had treated only one girl for rape, and that this attack had not taken place at the church.
Suspension.
In January 2010, the MCSA laid undisclosed internal charges against Verryn, and after a hearing he was suspended on 19 January 2010. The fact that the charges were initially undisclosed did nothing to quell the rumours that the real reason for the charges was that there was substance to the accusations which had been made. A statement was later released that the basis for the charges had been that Verryn had exceeded his authority.
It has been suggested that the fact that South Africa was to hold the FIFA Soccer World Cup in July 2010 had something to do with the government's urgent need to clean up the city, and with the Methodist church's decision to at last take decisive action in the matter. Others have suggested that the official grounds for Verryn's suspension amounted to a cover-up.
While suspended from his position as Bishop and his station as minister and superintendent of the Johannesburg Circuit, Verryn remains an ordained minister within the Methodist Church.

2012 Oklahoma wildfires

The 2012 Oklahoma wildfires are a series of wildfires that are currently active throughout the state of Oklahoma. Since earlier in the year, a widespread drought caused many areas, specifically in the southern United States, to be exposed to wildfires.
Starting in early August, the wildfires burned at least 52,000 acres, and destroyed at least 121 homes and businesses. A wildfire near Luther in Central Oklahoma destroyed about 50 homes and other buildings before getting under control on August 4. Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency on July 30 due to the drought and wildfires.
Ongoing high winds have continued to affect Oklahoma. In Durant, high winds forced Union Pacific Railroad shut down one of their main railways through the town. In late November, Oklahoma State University researchers said that the wildfires and the ongoing drought were responsible for over $400 million in damages, harvest loss, and livestock loss.

William Thourlby

William Leo Thourlby (January 22, 1924 – April 15, 2013) was an American actor, model and writer. He was known for his rugged, cowboy look, when he appeared as the face of the Marlboro Man campaign in the 1950s. This ad campaign was one of the 20th century's most famous ad campaign that redefined the Marlboro brand image from a cigarette for women to being a manlier, "Macho smoke."
Career.
Thourlby started his modelling career by working for the pulp magazine covers. Thourlby appeared in the films "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962), "The Creeping Terror" (1964) as Dr. Bradford and as Ben Wiley in "Angel's Flight" (1965). He was also the producer of "Angel's Flight".
He was given the role of an Indian Chief in a sportsmen's show in New York with Jim Thorpe.
He appeared on Broadway in "Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?" with Jayne Mansfield and Walter Matthau.
He was also a published writer; his books included "You Are What You Wear" (1995), "Passport To Power" (1992), and "Women The New Power Class" (2002).
He owned a restaurant partnered with his friend, Jim Thorpe, in Los Angeles, in the 1950s, which later closed down.
Personal life.
William Thourlby was born on January 22, 1924 in Detroit, Michigan, USA. He was the son of William H. Thourlby and Edith Thourlby. He had two more siblings, both sisters; Margaret P. Thourlby and Gloria G. Thourlby.
Compared to his other colleagues, who were also the faces of Marlboro during that time, Thourlby claimed that he never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol.
He was also friends with the world famous athlete, Jim Thorpe when they first partnered together to open up a local restaurant in Los Angeles. William Thourlby once described his relationship with Jim Thorpe as, “Jim adopted me as his son in an Indian ceremony – I called him Dad and he called me ‘my boy.’” Thorpe helped Thourlby land several roles in movies before his Marlboro campaign. When Thorpe died in 1953, that is when Thourlby was offered the Marlboro ad.
Up until he died, Thourlby lived alone in the New York Athletic Club for forty years and was one of the three permanent tenants that resided there. The club has a formal dress code unlike the cowboy look Thourlby is famous for, but he never had a problem abiding to the dress code because he himself, lived by those dressing standards.
Thourlby went through two divorces and had four children; Jamie Williams, Abby Thourlby, Liza Grace Thourlby and Nana Black. His daughter Liza Thourlby died in March 2006, at the age of 43 in Florida. William Thourlby preferred to spend his latter years mostly in solitude.
He died on April 15, 2013 in New York, at the age of 89.

George Howard Michell AC (3 August 1913 - June 26, 2012) was an Australian wool merchant, industrialist and philanthropist.
He was director of the family company, GH Michell and Sons, for 60 years, and instrumental in its rise to be the largest wool processing company in the world.
Born in Adelaide, South Australia, Michell was educated at Prince Alfred College.
Mt Bogong tragedy.
In August 1936 at the age of 23, Michell set out on a cross-country skiing expedition to Mount Bogong, Victoria with two experienced skiers, Cleve Cole and Mick Hull. Leaving Hotham Heights on 5 August, they set out across the Bogong High Plains carrying provisions for several days.They intended to reach the summit of Mt Bogong and then continue over the far side to the Staircase Hut, in which they had stored provisions for the return trip during the summer. On August 6, they were overcome by the worst blizzard in several years. The men dug a snow cave and waited four days for the blizzard to end. On August 9, with food already running short, they decided to make a break for the Staircase Hut, but lost their way in the whiteout conditions. They were unable to retrace their steps, and therefore wandered for five days without food, descending the wrong side of Mt Bogong in the fog. On the 14th, the men reached Big River Valley and sought refuge in a hollow log, but they were severely weakened from exhaustion, starvation and exposure. Cole was unable to continue, and it was decided that Hull should stay with him while Michell set out in search of help.
Late on the night of August 16, Michell reached the settlement at Glen Valley and raised the alarm. Search parties totalling eighty men set out the following morning. Michell, suffering frostbite to his hands and feet, was taken to Omeo hospital by car. Two of his toes had to be amputated.
A party of seven searchers located Hull and Cole early on the 18th. Using improvised stretchers, they were brought to Glen Valley. Hull began to recover but little hope was held for Cole, who was delirious and badly frostbitten. Cole died late on the night of the 19th.
The following year, the Royal Humane Society of Australasia awarded Michell and Hull each a silver medal for gallantry. The ordeal led to the establishment of snow-lines and series of refuge huts on Bogong to render shelter to future skiers; these include the Cleve Cole Hut (built 1937) and Michell Hut (1967). Michell Hut was burnt in the bushfires of 2003, and a replacement built in 2005.
GH Michell and Sons.
A couple of years after the Mt Bogong tragedy, Michell became a director of the family company, GH Michell and Sons, then based at Hindmarsh.During his time, the company was buying 10-15% of the entire Australian wool clip. Michell consolidated its operations to its present Salisbury site in 1973. He also drove an international expansion of the company's wool and tannery operation, particularly in China and Ireland. In 1987, when the company closed down its wool processing operations at Botany Bay, Michell established an industrial park, Lakes Business Park, on the site.
Philanthropy.
Howard and Christine Michell were keen supporters of the performing and visual arts. They made considerable contributions to the Art Gallery of South Australia, both financially and of works. They were involved in setting up the gallery's foundation in 1980. They also set up an endowment fund to support and purchase the works of young and emerging artists.
In 1990, Michell was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia for his services to the wool industry and the arts.

Sudangphaa

Sudangphaa was the king of Ahom kingdom from 1397 CE to 1407 CE. He was popularly known as “"Bamuni Konwar"” or “the Brahman prince” because of his upbringing in a Brahman’s house. His reign marks the first stage in the growth of Brahmanical influence and Hinduism amongs the Ahoms. He initiated the Singarigharutha ceremony, which is a Tai-Ahom ceremony of coronation of kings, a tradition which will be followed by his successors.
Birth and Childhood.
Sudangphaa was the son of Ahom king Tyao Khamti, from his younger queen. King Tyao Khamti went on a military expedition against the Sutiya Kingdom, to avenge the murder of his elder brother, king Sutuphaa. He appointed his elder queen in charge of the kingdom, in his absence. The younger queen was pregnant at the time of the king’s departure. The elder queen was jealous of the younger queen as the latter was more favourite to the king and also she was about to give birth to king’s first child, which will enhance her position. Therefore in order to get rid of younger queen, the elder queen took advantage of her position as regent to cause a false accusation to be preferred against her. The charge was investigated and declared true, whereupon the elder queen ordered her to be beheaded. The ministers however, seeing that she was pregnant, instead of killing her set her adrift on the Brahmaputra on a raft. The raft floated for some time and landed in Habung village, where a Brahman gave the unfortunate woman shelter. She died after giving birth to a boy and told the Brahman about the real identity of the boy. The Brahman brought up the young prince along with his other children. The young prince took the Brahman and his family as his own and spent his childhood with them.
Assassination of Tyao Khamti.
Meanwhile, King Tyao Khamti returned victorious from his campaign against the Sutiya Kingdom. He was horrified to hear of the execution of his favourite wife, especially when a new and impartial enquiry showed that the allegations against her were false. He was, however, too much under the influence of his elder queen to venture to take action against her. This, and his failure to prevent her from committing numerous acts of oppression, irritated the nobles so much that in 1389 CE, they caused him to be assassinated. The notorious elder queen was also put to death and was entombed along with the king in Charaideo.
Accession to the throne.
Since there was no suitable successors to the throne, Chaothai Khum Burhagohain and Borgohain ruled the kingdom without a king from 1389 CE to 1397 CE. In 1397 CE, an Ahom trader named Thao Cheoken went across the Brahmaputra to trade in cattle, and there, in Habung village, he saw the young prince. Curious by the young boy’s noble appearance, he made inquiries about him, and learnt that he was the son of king Tyao Khamti’s younger queen. The Burhagohain was informed of these facts and after verifying the story and consulting the other ministers, he brought the young prince, who was then fifteen years of age, to the capital Charaideo and placed him on the throne. He took the name Sudangphaa and took control of his royal authority.
Reign.
Introduction of Hindu religious rituals in Ahom court.
Sudangphaa brought with him from the Habung country the Brahman who had sheltered him and his sons. The latter were given post of importance on the frontier, while the old Brahman himself was installed as his confidential adviser, and, under his influence, many Hindu rites and ceremonies began to observed. The Brahman introduced the prayer of Lakshmi-Narayan Salgram in the royal palace. It was the beginning of Brahmanical influence and attraction towards Hinduism by the Ahom Dynasty.
Supression of Tipam Chiefs.
The Tipam Chiefs, who were dissatisfied with the new regime, hatched a plot against the young king. This came to his ears, but instead of at once taking open steps against the conspirators, he caused a stockade for catching elephants to be constructed, and having caught some elephants, invited them to join him in the celebrating the occasion by a feast. When the festivities were in full swing and all suspicion had been allayed, the conspirators were suddenly overpowered and put to death. According to a practice which was common among the Ahoms and many Asiatic tribes, their heads were piled up in a heap as a trophy.
War with Mungkang.
The reasons for the outbreak of war with Mungkang, a shan state in Upper Burma during the reign of Sudangphaa, vary among the historians. One chronicle stated that Sudangphaa endeavoured to conciliate the rest of the Tipamias by marrying the daughter of one of their chiefs named Khuntai. The girl, however, had already became enamoured of a Tipamia named Tai Sulai, and the latter, after dining one night with the king, sent a ring to the queen by one of his servants. The king was informed of this, and called for an explanation from Tai Sulai, who fled forthwith to Surumpha, king of Mungkang, and begged for help. Some historians differ with this version of story. According to them, Tai Sulai was the youngest son of Ahom king Sukhaangphaa and princess of Kamata kingdom Bhajani (some sources say the princess name was Rajani; some said that Rajani and Bhajani were two sisters who were married to Sukhangphaa). After the assassination of Tyaokhamti, Tai Chulai attempted to became king, but the nobles led by Chaothai Khum Burhagohain opposed his candidature at that time. Later when Chaothai Khum Burhagohain and other nobles installed Sudangphaa as the king of Ahom kingdom, a disheartened Tai Chulai went to Mungkang and informed its ruler that the Ahom dynasty founded by Sukaphaa has ended and the kingdom was in the state of anarchy. The rulers of Mungkang used to consider Sukaphaa and the Ahom dynasty as his kinsmen as both claim to be descendant of Lengdon or Indra, the god of heaven and earth. Surumpha, the king of Mungkang, sent a military expedition along with Tai Chulai, led by his minister, Tasim Pou Borgohain. Sudangphaa personally led his army against the invaders and a battle was fought near Kuhiarbari in the Tipam country. Sudangphaa sustained a slight wound from an enemy spear while riding on an elephant at the head of his army in the battlefield, but the battle turned in Ahom's favour and the invaders were defeated. Sudangphaa ordered Nangchukham Borgohain to chase the vanquished enemy, who chased them as far as Patkai hill range. At last, the commander of Mungkang army, Tasim Pou Borgohain, sought peace from Ahom side, to which the commander of Ahom army, Nangchukham Borgohain, agreed. A formal treaty was concluded in 1401 CE, by which the Patkai hill range was fixed as the boundary between the two countries. The meeting of the two Borgohains, who conducted the negotiations for peace, took place on the side of Nongnyang lake, twenty-eight miles south-west of Margherita and statues of them are said to have been carved in the rock there. A solemn oath of amity was sworn, and consecrated by the cutting up of a fowl. The word Patkai is said to be derived from this incident. The full name was "Pat-kai-seng-keu", which means “cut-fowl-oath-sworn”. The former name of the pass was "Dai-kau-rang" or “the junction of nine peaks”. "Nong-nyang" means “lake shaking”.
Transfer of Capital and Singarigharutha ceremony.
After the peace treaty with Mungkang, Sudangphaa decided to transfer his capital from Charaideo to Charguwa near Dihing river in 1403 CE. On the occasion of establishing a new capital, Sudangphaa performed the Singarigharutha ceremony, the traditional Tai-Ahom coronation ceremony of kings. The ceremony was termed as Singarigharutha because the woods of Singari tree were used to construct the main platform in which the King used to sit during the procedure of the ceremony.
Expedition against Kamata kingdom.
Meanwhile Tai Sulai, being deprieved of his asylum, took refuge with the king of Kamata. Sudangphaa demanded extradition of Tai Sulai, but the ruler of Kamata refused. Sudangphaa dispatched Nangchukham Borgohain to invade Kamata. At that time, Muslim rulers from Bengal invaded Kamata. Therefore the king of Kamata desired peace with Ahoms. He gave one his daughter in marriage to Sudangphaa, with a dowry of two elephants and a number of horses and a number of horses and male and female servants, as well as a quantity of gold and silver.
Subjugation of Tipam, Khamjang and Aiton tribes.
The chiefs of Tipam, Khamjang and Aiton tribes rebelled against the authority of Sudangphaa by refusing to pay tribute. It was found that the king of Nara (one of the Shan kingdoms in Upper Burma) was encouraging the rebels. Sudangphaa sent messengers to remonstrate with the king of Nara, who in turn warned the rebel chiefs not to expect any aid from him. This turn of events forced the rebel chiefs to submit to the authority of Sudangphaa.
Death, Character and Legacy.
Sudangphaa died in 1407 after a reign of ten years. In his chronicle about the history of Assam, Gunaviram Barua stated that the king indulged most of his time in pleasure, which is also the reason for his demise at a young age, but its accuracy is doubtful since none of the old Ahom chronicles or Buranjis agrees with it. On the other hand, he was described as young and energetic. During his ten years long reign, he faced threats, both internal and external, yet he never loses his nerves and deals every problem with determination and wits. During the war with Mungkang, he personally led his army and gained decisive victory, in spite getting injured by enemy’s spear. Sudangphaa also introduced religious practices of Hinduism among the Ahom community, although it will take many more years to completely bring the Ahom community in its fold. The practice of Singarigharutha of Ahom kings was also introduced by him, which will be followed by his successors almost till the end of Ahom supremacy in Assam.

Arthur Fleischmann

Arthur Fleischmann (born 1896, Bratislava; d. 2 March 1990, Tenerife) was a Slovak-born, London-based sculptor, who pioneered the use of Perspex in sculpture. He spent time in Bali, and in Australia, where he was at the centre of the Merioola Group, before settling in London.
Early life.
Fleischmann was born in 1896 in Bratislava, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. He studied medicine in Budapest and Prague, before turning to sculpture, and winning a scholarship to the Master School of Sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna.
Australian years.
He left Europe in 1937, travelling to South Africa and Zanzibar before spending two years in Bali, where he converted from his native Judaism to Catholicism, with the encouragement of a Dutch colonial missionary, Father Buys. The forms of traditional Balinese dancers became a lifelong influence on Fleischmann’s work.
Fleeing the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Fleischmann moved to Australia in 1939, where he became the centre of the Merioola Group, named after his home in Rosemont Avenue, Woollahra. He was elected a member of the Society of Artists in Sydney, sculpting portraits of prominent Australians including Cardinal Gilroy, Governor-General Lord Gowrie, Sir Frederick Jordan, Sir John Butters, Sir Percy Spender, the pianist Gaultiero Volterra and violinist Jeanne Gautier.
His two best-known works from this period are the 1946 "Wishing Tree" Memorial for the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney; and the Bronze Doors on the Mitchell Wing of the State Library of New South Wales, given by Sir William Dixson in honour of David Scott Mitchell.
London years.
In 1948, Fleischmann returned to Europe and settled in London. He married his wife Joy in 1959 and their son, the photographer Dominique Fleischmann, was born in 1961.
Fleischmann produced sculptures of personalities of the day, including Lord Robens, the opera singer Kathleen Ferrier, the actress Joan Collins, and the ballerina Svetlana Beriosova. His bust of Trevor Howard is in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery.
Fleishmann pioneered the use of Perspex in sculpture, including some notable public pieces.
In 1956, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company (PSNC) commissioned "The Birth of Aphrodite" for their ship "Reina del Mar". Fleischmann carved the piece from a half-ton block of clear Perspex built up from laminated sheets. For the 1970 World Expo in Osaka, Japan, he created a perspex fountain for the British Pavilion, entitled "Harmony and progress". In 1963, he featured in a British Pathe newsreel about Perspex sculpture.
In 1977 his "Crystal Crown", carved out of a massive block of acrylic, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II at St Katharine Docks in London, in celebration of her Silver Jubilee. The acrylic block had originally been commissioned by Stanley Kubrick as the alien monolith in the film "2001 - A Space Odyssey", but Kubrick rejected it in favour of a piece made from black basalt.
Fleischmann’s work was influenced by his Roman Catholic faith; he is the only artist to have sculpted four Popes from life. His "Tryptych of the Holy Rosary" (1958) was commissioned for the Lady Chapel at Westminster Cathedral. It consists of three clear Perspex panels carved in relief.
His bronze of Pope John Paul II was unveiled at the Venerable English College in Rome by the Pope on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the college in 1979.
Other later portrait subjects include Sir Charles Mackerras, the ballerina Doreen Wells, and the actor Barry Humphries. His last work was a Perspex water sculpture, "Tribute to the Discovery of DNA"; like his early "Bronze Doors", it is installed at the New South Wales State Library.
Fleischmann died on 2 March 1990 at the age of 93, while on holiday in Tenerife.
Legacy.
In 2001, the Arthur Fleischmann Foundation was formed. Working with the Mestske Muzeum and the City of Bratislava Council, the Foundation helped set up a permanent museum in the house at 6 Biela Ulice, Bratislava where Arthur Fleischmann grew up.
He is also commemorated with a plaque at his London home, 92 Carlton Hill, Westminster. The plaque was unveiled on 28 July 1998 by the Austrian and Slovakian ambassadors, together with the Deputy Lord Mayor of Westminster, Joy Fleischmann, and former Arts Minister, Lord Gowrie.

<doc id="36640008" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36640008" title="Middle Chinese finals">
Middle Chinese finals

In Middle Chinese, the phonological system of medieval rime dictionaries and rime tables, the final is the rest of the syllable after the initial consonant.
This analysis is derived from the traditional Chinese "fanqie" system of indicating pronunciation with a pair of characters indicating the sounds of the initial and final parts of the syllable respectively, though in both cases several characters were used for each sound.
Reconstruction of the pronunciation of finals is much more difficult than for initials due to the combination of multiple phonemes into a single class, and there is no agreement as to their values.
Because of this lack of consensus, understanding of the reconstruction of finals requires delving into the details of rime tables and rime dictionaries.
Finals and rhyme classes.
Each final is contained within a single rhyme class, but a rhyme class may contain more than one final:
Classes of finals.
Karlgren noticed that classes of finals from the rime dictionaries were placed in different rows of the rime tables.
As three classes of final occurred in the first, second and fourth rows respectively, he named them finals of divisions I, II and IV.
The remaining finals he called "division-III finals" because they occurred in the third row of the tables.
Some of these (the "pure" or "independent" division-III finals) occurred only in that row, while others (the "mixed" finals) could also occur in the second or fourth rows with some initials.
Karlgren disregarded the "chongniu" distinction, but later workers have emphasized its importance.
Li Rong, in a systematic comparison of the rhyme tables with a recently discovered early edition of the "Qieyun", identified seven classes of finals.
The table below lists the combinations of initial and final classes that occur in the "Qieyun", with the row of the rime tables in which each combination was placed:
The mixed and "chongniu" finals, though designated as division-III finals, are spread across rows 2 and 4 as well as row 3 of the tables.
To handle these cases, a distinction is made between the row that the homophone class is placed in and the "division" of its final. This article distinguishes rows by Arabic numerals 1 2 3 4 and divisions by Roman numerals I II III IV. In addition, "chóngniǔ" finals in division III are notated in the table of final outcomes below as III/3 or III/4, depending on the row in which they occur.
Significance of the division.
There are correspondences between certain divisions and the presence or absence of medial glides in later dialects, in ways that differ depending on the class of the initial (e.g. velar, labial, retroflex, etc.). There are also clear co-occurrence restrictions between initials and divisions, in that initials from certain of these same classes can occur with finals only from certain divisions. The LMC authors of this system appear to have been aware of these classes of initials, and seem to have determined the separation into divisions partly on the basis of the co-occurrence relationships and partly on the medial glides, although it is debated how the exact classification was made. It is important to remember that the authors of this system were attempting to use LMC phonology to reconstruct EMC phonology (although they probably thought of it more in terms of trying to harmonize the way that words were normally pronounced with the rather different system of rhymes and homophones as laid out in the "Qieyun").
The clearest difference is between division III and other divisions, with division III generally corresponding to palatal initials and/or finals with palatal (i.e. high-front) vowels or glides. In addition, divisions I and IV allow exactly the same set of initials in EMC, suggesting that the distinction between the two postdates the EMC period. Division-IV syllables are commonly thought to reflect a diphthong containing a vocalic glide /i/ in LMC, corresponding to an EMC mid-front monophthong, variously reconstructed as or . Beyond this, there is no consensus.
Karlgren, and many authors following him, suggest that neither divisions I nor II had any medial other than /w/ or /u/, with division I corresponding to back vowels and division II to front vowels. Some authors have suggested that division II corresponded not so much to front vowels as to centralized vowels. Many authors have recently suggested that division-II syllables consistently had a medial /r/ in Old Chinese, although this appeared to have already disappeared by EMC, so it's unclear exactly how this would have been carried forward into LMC. (Some have suggested that the system of divisions dates back at least to the time of the "Qieyun" (c. 600 AD), and reflects a medial present very early on in the EMC period.)
Table of Early Middle Chinese finals.
The following table lists Early Middle Chinese (EMC) reconstructed "finals" (i.e. all of the syllable other than the initial consonant), according to different authors. It also lists the corresponding Late Middle Chinese (LMC) outcomes according to Pulleyblank, and the Standard Mandarin outcomes using Pinyin spelling. The table does not explicitly list finals ending in /p/, /t/ or /k/ (the so-called "entering tone" syllables), but these can easily be derived by substituting for , for , and for . Note also that some columns are not strictly in IPA.
Codes for initial classes:
The modern outcomes are listed using the following codes:
The outcomes are written either as individual outcomes in Pinyin, or combined outcomes in "pseudo-Pinyin" (when the outcome begins with a "-" or uppercase letter). "Pseudo-Pinyin" uses Pinyin conventions but without any of the abbreviations normally in use in Pinyin. Examples:
When not indicated, the choice of whether a velar or palatal occurs is determined by the following vowel: palatals before "-i" or "-ü", velars elsewhere.
Example: A listed outcome like "-uo, Ge, PMo; also Ta, occ. wo" means that the outcome is "-e" for a guttural (i.e. "ge, ke, he, e"); "-o" for a labial (i.e. "po, bo, mo"); "-uo" elsewhere; but for alveolar stops, "-a" also appears (i.e. either "tuo, duo" or "ta, da"), and "wo" occasionally appears instead of "e" as the outcome of MC "ʔ-" or "ŋ-" (the outcome of both is a "null initial", which is counted as a "guttural" in the modern outcomes).
These outcomes assume the normal correspondences between EMC initials and Standard Mandarin initials:
In a couple of situations where two different EMC initials have merged, the modern outcome is nonetheless different depending on the EMC initial:

The Japanese martial art Judo was first introduced in the United Kingdom in 1899, when entrepreneur Edward William Barton-Wright sponsored a visit from a team of Japanese judoka with the intention of establishing a jujutsu school in England. The introduction was not immediately successful, but some members of the team, including Yukio Tani, remained in England and gradually cultivated public interest in Judo and other types of jujutsu through demonstrations, instruction, and prize fighting. The United Kingdom's first Judo dojo, the Budokwai, is the oldest in Europe and was founded by Gunji Koizumi in 1918 with Tani as its chief instructor. 
There are currently two state-wide Judo associations in the United Kingdom: the British Judo Association and the British Judo Council. The British Judo Association is the United Kingdom's official governing body for Judo and was established in 1948 under the chairmanship of Trevor Leggett. 
British citizens have won eighteen Olympic medals in Judo since it was added to the Summer games in 1964. Neil Adams is the United Kingdom's most successful judoka, winning silver in the -71 kg category in 1980, and in the -78 kg category in 1984. 
Two members of the United Kingdom's 2012 Olympic team received medals in Judo: Gemma Gibbons won silver in the -78 kg category, and Karina Bryant won bronze in the +78 kg category. Gibbons' popularity surged after the win, with the number of followers on her Twitter account jumping from 600 to more than 22,600 in 24 hours, and the number of 'likes' on her Facebook page growing by 3000 per cent. A week later, the British Judo Association announced that its website had received thousands of search requests for local clubs since Gibbons and Bryant's wins. 
At the 2012 Paralympics, Ben Quilter won bronze in the -60 kg category, and Sam Ingram won silver in the -90 kg category. 
Journalist Mark Law was named 'Best New Writer' in the 2008 British Sports Book Awards for his book "The Pyjama Game: A Journey into Judo", which was later published as "Falling Hard: A Journey into the World of Judo" in the United States. The book is a history of Judo in Japan, Britain, and other parts of the world, framed by Law's own experience of beginning Judo after his fiftieth birthday and working his way up to "sho dan" (first-degree black belt) at the Budokwai.

Tyao Khamti

Tyao Khamti was the king of Ahom kingdom from 1380 CE to 1387 CE. His accession to the throne puts an end to the interregnum in Ahom kingdom which lasted from 1376 CE to 1380 CE, after king Sutuphaa was treacherously murdered by Sutiya king. He personally led a military expedition against the Sutiya Kingdom to avenge the death of his elder brother, the Ahom king Sutuphaa. But his weakness towards his elder queen and to her acts of atrocities towards common people, ultimately leads to his own assassination, followed by another interregnum.
Ancestry and Accession to the throne.
Tyao Khamti was the third son of Ahom king Sukhaangphaa. After the death of king Sukhaangphaa, his two elder sons subsequently succeeded him, Sukhrangphaa from 1332 CE to 1364 CE, and Sutuphaa from 1364 CE to 1376 CE. In 1376 CE, Ahom king Sutuphaa was treacherously murdered by the Sutiya king. The nobles led by the Burhagohain and the Borgohain came into conclusion that none of the princes were fit enough to rule the kingdom, therefore, the ministers, Burhagohain and Borgohain ruled the kingdom without any king for four years (1376-1380). Finding it difficult to rule the state without a king, the nobles installed Tyao Khamti as the king of Ahom kingdom in 1380 CE.
Reign.
Expedition against Sutiya Kingdom.
Tyao Khamti wanted to avenge the murder of his elder brother Sutuphaa by Sutiya king. Therefore after his accession to the throne, he personally led a military expedition against Sutiya Kingdom. The Sutiya army was defeated and the Sutiya king and nobles fled into the interiors of hills, in a bid to escape the wrath of Tyao Khamti. Tyao Khamti laid waste to the countryside of Sutiya Kingdom and returned to his capital Charaideo.
Affairs in Royal family.
Tyao Khamti had two wives. Out of the two, the younger queen or the second wife was his favorite. Before going to war with Sutiya kingdom, Tyao Khamti had appointed his elder queen in charge of the kingdom, in his absence. The younger queen was pregnant at the time of thking’s departure. The elder queen was jealous of the younger queen as the latter was more favorite to the king and also she was about to give birth to king’s first child, which will enhance her position. Therefore in order to get rid of younger queen, the elder queen took advantage of her position as regent to cause a false accusation to be preferred against her. The charge was investigated and declared true, whereupon the elder queen ordered her to be beheaded. The ministers however, seeing that she was pregnant, instead of killing her set her adrift on the Brahmaputra on a raft. The raft floated for some time and landed in Habung village, where a Brahman gave the unfortunate woman shelter. She died after giving birth to a boy and told the Brahmin about the real identity of the boy. The Brahmin brought up the young prince along with his other children. The young prince took the Brahmin and his family as his own and spent his childhood with them. Later the boy would be crowned as the king of Ahom Kingdom in 1397 CE, and was named as Sudangphaa.
Assassination.
Meanwhile, King Tyao Khamti returned victorious from his campaign against the Sutiya Kingdom. He was horrified to hear of the execution of his favourite wife, especially when a new and impartial enquiry showed that the allegations against her were false. He was, however, too much under the influence of his elder queen to venture to take action against her. This, and his failure to prevent her from committing numerous acts of oppression, irritated the nobles so much that in 1389 CE, they caused him to be assassinated. The notorious elder queen was also put to death and was entombed along with the king in Charaideo.
Character and Legacy.
Not much is written about Tyao Khamti’s character in ancient Ahom chronicles, yet one can find that he was brave and courageous, from the fact that he personally led the army against Sutiya kingdom and achieved victory, yet his inability to take action against his elder queen, showed the weakness in his character. His assassination resulted in another period of interregnum which lasted from 1389 CE to 1397 CE, till his son Sudangphaa by his second wife ascended the throne.

<doc id="36640091" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36640091" title="The Sting!">
The Sting!

The Sting! is a strategy/adventure video game developed by Neo Software and released by JoWooD Entertainment on July 1, 2001. It is the sequel to 1994's The Clue! (known as Der Clou! in Austria).
Description.
The player assumes the role of Matt Tucker, a famous burglar who has just come out of prison in the city of Fortune Hills. In the beginning, Matt is reduced to a small time crook who has to work his way back to his former glory. After performing several burglaries, alone or with the help of accomplices he has met at various locations around the city, he collects loot and fame. By selling the loot he is able to buy better tools to use in increasingly challenging missions, with the ultimate goal being the Ministry of Light.
The gameplay consists of two modes, the planning mode and the live mode. The planning is done from Matt's apartment where actions and movements are carefully laid out. Then by going "live" the player will find out if the plan works or if everyone has gotten caught. Different locations can include patrolling guards and police, security systems, locked doors and cabinets and other obstacles. At the same time, Matt's different tools are useful in different situations as well as making different levels of noise.
The Sting! was one of the first third-person 3D games to allow the player to freely roam a city, with a transportation system (taxis) to facilitate this, many buildings he can explore and buy tools, meet accomplices or observe, prior to planning a burglary.
Name Origin.
The name The Sting! comes from the fact that the 1973 movie "The Sting" has the German title "Der Clou". So when the game was called "Der Clou" in Austria, the English translation became "The Sting".
Reception.
The game received mixed reviews by the critics, with a Metascore of 73% according to Metacritic. Most of the reviewers praised the light-hearted tone of the game and the unique theme of it. IGN stated "I haven't played a game like this in a long time... or ever really I guess. Funny cartoony little games are much fewer and far between on the PC nowadays. While there are a share of those cartoony style games set in 2D landscapes, you'll have to look pretty hard to find more than a couple that take advantage of the third dimension to really bring colorful and silly worlds to life. Not only does the Sting do this fairly well, but it also provides some interesting gameplay"
However, a number of problems held back the game's score on multiple occasions. Reviewers noted the clipping problems of the graphics engine, the slow pace of the game and problematic pathfinding AI as the most serious problems with the title.

<doc id="36640094" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36640094" title="Annandale Plantation">
Annandale Plantation

Annandale Plantation was a historic cotton plantation and Italianate-style plantation house in what is now the Mannsdale neighborhood of Madison, Mississippi. The house was designed and built for Margaret Louisa Thompson Johnstone, the wealthy widow of John T. Johnstone. Completed during the late 1850s, it was destroyed in a fire during the mid-1920s. A replacement, part of a modern residential development, was later built at the site during the mid-20th century.
Before the new mansion was built, Mrs. Johnstone commissioned what is known as the Chapel of the Cross, in memory of her late husband. This Gothic Revival-style structure was completed in 1852 on the plantation property. Johnstone deeded it and 10 acres to the Episcopal Diocese. The chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
History.
John Taylor Johnstone, born on April 28, 1801, migrated with his family to Mississippi from Hillsborough, North Carolina about 1820. He eventually had total land holdings of , divided among a number of plantations, and engaged in farming. Through this he accumulated a fortune from the cotton market.
The Johnstones had two daughters, Frances Ann and Helen Scrymgeour Johnstone, and two sons, Samuel and Noah Thompson Johnstone. Both sons died in 1840, the same year that the family moved to Mannsdale. Johnstone used part of his fortune to build Ingleside, a family plantation house in the Mannsdale area, for Frances and her husband, as she was his first daughter to marry.
After his death, his widow Margaret Johnstone built a chapel and another plantation house, Annandale, on the large plantation property. She donated the chapel and some property to the Episcopal church in her husband's memory.
The first Johnstone home on the Annandale plantation was a large log house. Tradition maintains that Johnstone was descended from the Johnstone family who once held the title Earl of Annandale and Hartfell in the Peerage of Scotland and that he named his plantation in their honor. Frances Johnstone married William J. Britton in 1844. Her father had Ingleside built for the couple as a gift; it was completed in 1846. The Italianate house, with a wide front facade, contained eight bedrooms, dressing rooms, a parlor, library, dining room, breakfast room, and an office. 
John T. Johnstone died on April 23, 1848, leaving Margaret a widow. Prior to building a new house at Annandale, Margaret Johnstone had the masonry Gothic Revival-style Chapel of the Cross, completed in 1852, built in memory of her late husband. Located on the plantation property, it was a quarter of a mile north of the future site of the Annandale mansion. After completion, she transferred ownership of the church and surrounding to the newly created Episcopal Diocese of Mississippi. The Chapel was assessed under the Historic American Buildings Survey in the twentieth century and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.
A few years later, Mrs. Johnstone hired the architect Jacob Lamour from New York to design a new mansion for her and her unmarried daughter, Helen. He adapted the design from a plan in Minard Lafever's "Architectural Instructor", published in 1856. Construction of the grand three-story, 40-room mansion in the Italianate mode began in mid-1857 and was completed in 1859. It featured one-story arched arcades that encircled the entire structure and spacious interior hallways, providing abundant shade and ventilation.
Helen Johnstone was engaged to be married in 1857 to Henry Grey Vick, descended from the founder of Vicksburg. Their wedding was set for May 21, 1859 but Vick was killed in a duel in Mobile, Alabama on May 17, 1859. Helen later married the Rev. George Carroll Harris, an Episcopal priest, in 1862.
During the American Civil War, her mother Margaret Johnstone cared for sick and wounded Confederate soldiers and supplied money and material to the military. Margaret Johnstone died at Annandale on March 16, 1880. The plantation was sold after her death.
After many years of George and Helen Johnstone Harris' moving around while he served as an Episcopal priest, the couple built a grand house for their retirement, Mont Helena, in Rolling Fork. Situated atop an ancient platform mound, the two-and-a-half story mansion was built on land left to Helen by her family.
The Britton home, Ingleside, burned down in 1906, and Frances Johnstone Britton died on March 24, 1907. Her sister Helen Johnstone Harris died on November 19, 1917. The Annandale mansion, then unoccupied, was destroyed in a fire on September 9, 1924. A Classical Revival-style replacement is at the site of the former mansion.
The former plantation is now divided between two communities, Annandale Estates on the west side of Mannsdale Road and Reunion on the east. As golfing communities each has its own golf club, also on the former plantation lands, known as the Annandale Golf Club and the Reunion Golf and Country Club.
Folklore.
Annandale Plantation has two ghost stories associated with it that have been published in at least two books. One, the "The Ghosts of Annandale", in "Jeffrey Introduces 13 More Southern Ghosts" by Kathryn Tucker Windham details the supposed hauntings. One ghost is claimed in the story to be that of Annie Devlin, a former governess for Helen who died at the Annandale mansion in June 1860 and was purported to haunt its halls until the night it burned in 1924. The other is reportedly that of Helen Johnstone. The story claims that the ghost of Helen now weeps at the grave of Henry Vick, her former fiancé, in the churchyard of the Chapel of the Cross.

A History of the University in Europe

A History of the University in Europe is a four-volume book series on the history and development of the European university from the medieval origins of the institution until the present day. The series was directed by the European University Association and published by Cambridge University Press between 1992 and 2011. The volumes consist of individual contributions by international experts in the field and is considered the most comprehensive and authoritative work on the subject to date. It has been fully or partly translated into several languages.
Synopsis.
The first volume is dedicated to the emergence of the university in the Middle Ages and its development until around 1500. Volume II describes and analyzes the university from the Reformation until the French Revolution (1500–1800), volume III the rise of the modern university until World War II (1800–1945) and the last volume the post-war period up to the present time.
The structure of the book follows a standardized systematic pattern throughout all volumes: the first part ("themes and patterns") introduces the reader to the university as an institution of its time. The second part deals with the institutional "structures" of the university, the third with the "students", their education, activities and careers, and the fourth with individual fields of "learning" taught in the university. Each section is divided into several chapters which were composed by specialists in the various subjects. The main approach is holistic – the book aims less at covering the history of individual universities, but rather the character and historical trajectory of the institution as a whole.
As of 2011, the series has been published in full in English and German, while the first volumes have appeared in Spanish and Portuguese and translations into Russian and Chinese are in preparation.
Reception.
According to its editors, the comprehensive scope of "A History of the University in Europe" has been rivalled only by one previous multi-volume work, the "Geschichte der Entstehung und Entwickelung der hohen Schulen unsres Erdtheils" ("History of the emergence and development of the higher schools of our continent") which was published in 1802–05 by the German philosopher Christoph Meiners. In the English-language discourse, the book has been welcomed as an overhaul of Hastings Rashdall's long-time standard work "The Universities in Europe in the Middle Ages" and its 1936 revision by the medievalists F. M. Powicke and A. B. Emden.
The book has received high praise from several reviewers. Edward Grant regards the first part as "the best single volume on the history of medieval universities", noting its comprehensiveness, readability and authority produced by competent editorship and "outstanding contributors". Susan Rosa believes that this volume "sets a standard for competency in historical research", favourably mentioning the collaborative effort which produced little overlap between the various topics. Christopher Ocker lauds the first volume as the "first attempt at a comprehensive survey of this distinctive European institution, the first thorough survey to span every country from the time of the university's birth to humanism since Rashdall", but also thinks that the field of medieval science was somewhat neglected. Matthew Kempshall calls the book "a product of an array of distinguished European scholars", but feels that it might have gone too far in idealizing the university as a supranational institution transcending state particularisms.

Joseph J. Katz

Joseph J. Katz (born April 19, 1912 in Detroit, Michigan) was a chemist at Argonne National Laboratory whose fundamental research on the chemistry of photosynthesis led to his election to the US National Academy of Science. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Czarist Russia. Neither parent had any formal education.
Education and independent research.
His college education was in chemistry at the College of the City of Detroit (now Wayne State University). He worked for the next seven years at small companies in Detroit, developing adhesives, metal polishing compounds, lubricants and other specialty chemical formulations used in the automobile industry. While working in Detroit after receiving his bachelor’s degree, Katz and several colleagues rented a room in a Detroit office building and used it as a laboratory. They carried out independent research from 1932 through 1939, trying to cure tuberculosis by finding a substance that could dissolve the fatty outer coating of the TB bacillus so that it would be vulnerable to being destroyed by a drug. He and a Detroit colleague published two papers on studies with the bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing and non-pathogenic bacillus with similar physical properties to the tuberculosis bacillus.
Unemployed in summer 1939, he followed a suggestion from a former teacher and applied to graduate school in chemistry at the University of Chicago. His thesis research in physical organic chemistry under the supervision of Frank R. Mayo was a study of the mechanism of addition of hydrogen chloride to isobutene in a solvent of low dielectric constant. He received the PhD degree in March 1942.
Fe|By, Tribune staff reporter
Metallurgical research.
He then joined the research group of H. I. Schlesinger and H. C. Brown to synthesize volatile uranium compounds that might be useful for gaseous diffusion of 235U from 238U. As suggested by his colleague Norman Davidson, he introduced himself to G.T. Seaborg. He and Seaborg had the same birth dates. On March 27, 1943 he joined Seaborg's Section C-1 in the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago. His responsibility was to develop methods for the extraction and purification of plutonium halides, especially fluorides, using microgram amounts of 239Pu from neutron irradiated uranium.
At the end of World War II, Winston M. Manning, another Metallurgical Laboratory chemist who was a planner of the new institution that was to replace that wartime laboratory, asked Katz to join the staff of the new Argonne National Laboratory. Thus Dr Katz began a career as staff member of the Argonne National Laboratory Chemistry Division. He initiated a decade-long program in inorganic actinide chemistry, publishing papers on actinide oxides, borohydrides, and fluorides. This research led to several years of study of halogen fluorides, specifically when they are dissolved in liquid hydrogen fluoride, and to a focus on nuclear fuel technology: methods of separation of uranium, plutonium, and fission products in liquid hydrogen fluoride based on their differing volatilities.
Heavy-water studies.
During the 1950s, an official of the US Atomic Energy Commission offered Katz a 55-gallon drum of heavy water enriched to 99.7% level of deuterium. With this initial supply of a rare commodity, Katz and his colleagues embarked on a research program to study the biological effects of replacement of hydrogen in living organisms by deuterium. A major part of this research was to grow deuterated autotrophic organisms (organisms that require only inorganic nutrients), which led to decades of growth of green algae in heavy water and to the harvesting of deuterated biochemical molecules from these algae at the Argonne "algae farm".
Heavy-water studies with autotrophic algae led Katz into investigations of the mechanisms of photosynthesis, the field that dominated the rest of his scientific career. Because the mechanisms incorporate electron transfer and free radicals, electron paramagnetic resonance techniques were used to understand how chlorophyll uses light to transfer electrons in photosynthesis. Nuclear magnetic resonance techniques were employed to study the molecular structures of chlorophyll molecules.
Awards and honors.
Katz was the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry from its initiation in 1955 through 1983. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1956. He received the Midwest Award of the American Chemical Society in 1969. In 1973 he became the first Argonne scientist elected to the US National Academy of Sciences.
He achieved some fame (or perhaps notoriety) for the first "artificial leaf", an electrochemical cell in which electrical current is produced by the action of sunlight on chlorophyll. An artificial leaf was the ultimate goal but the actual investigation was to identify the mechanism by which chlorophyll receives energy from sunlight, causing electron transfer and storing solar energy as sugars.
Joseph J. Katz was awarded the Rumford Prize in 1992 with James Norris and George Feher "for working towards the understanding of photosynthesis". His formal retirement took place in 1992, at which time he was named a Senior Scientist Emeritus. He remained active in a research, writing, and advising role into the 21st century. Argonne National Laboratory has a named postdoctoral fellowship in honor of Joseph J. Katz.

Kulubnarti

Kulubnarti ("Kulb island") is a long island in Northern Sudan. Situated in the Nile, about south of the Egyptian border, it is part of the village of Kulb. Until the fifteenth century, this was a remote area. It was the last known refuge for Christians in Nubia, while Islam spread to the south. It has been inhabited since the time of the Christian kingdom of Makuria, approximately 1100 AD. Though continuously inhabited from the eleventh century to modern times, it is the only Nubian location which has demonstrated through archaeologically investigation a continuous occupation from the Middle Ages to modern history.
Kulubnarti has archaeological and anthropological significance because it has been subjected to one of the only systematic excavations of any site along the southern portion of the Nile. The primary motivation for excavation at Kulubnarti was to increase awareness and understanding of the cultural transition from Christianity to Islam in ancient Nubia. Nubia converted to Christianity by the late 6th century and Christianity prevailed as the dominant religion of the region until the 14th century when Moslems gained control of territory south of the 3rd Cataract. Christianity however, persisted into the 15th century in many regions lying north of the 3rd Cataract, including Kulubnarti. Prior to the archaeological study of Kulubnarti, this cultural transition was almost completely unknown archaeologically and only a few historical references were in existence.
Geography.
Kulubnarti is an island located about southwest of Wadi Halfa'", and just north of the Dal Cataract, which is located between the 2nd and 3rd Cataracts. It is in the Batn-El-Hajar region, a rugged, barren, and rocky area. The usual wide zone of alluvial fertile farmland on the banks of the Nile is missing; only small sections of the island is available for agriculture. The population lives mainly in the modern village on the west (Kulb West) and east (Kulb East) banks of the Nile. The altitude is about above sea level. There were several villages on this island, with castles, "kourfas", houses, and churches.
While Kulubnarti has not always been a permanent island, it adopted it’s now permanent island form following the construction of the Aswan High Dam. Prior to the dam’s construction, Kulubnarti was an island for only a few weeks each year when the Nile river was at its peak. Today, Kulubnarti is located at the head of Lake Nasser and is a ‘true island' when Lake Nasser’s water level is at maximum capacity.

Expeditions.
Johann Ludwig Burckhardt came on his first expedition south of the Nile to the 3rd Cataract in 1813. He was the first to view and describe the abandoned late Medieval era settlement situated on the southern end of Kulubnarti. He published his finds about the island and its small, domed church in his 1819 travelogue "Travels in Nubia". The first archaeological investigation was done by Somers Clarke in the early 20th century; he explored Christian building remains along the Nile between Cairo and Soba, publishing his findings in 1912, "Christian Antiquities in the Nile Valley". In 1969 and 1979, William Yewdale Adams led the University of Kentucky team's extensive excavations on the island and the neighboring mainland. There were a total of 19 Kulubnarti sites excavated by Adams and his team. Of these 19 sites, excavation uncovered 10 settlements, one church, one Christian cemetery, one pottery manufacturing locale, and six rock picture zones. Each of the 19 sites, except for the six rock picture zones, dated to the late medieval period. Approximately 1300 finds were collected and archived. The results showed a continuous history of settlement and exemplified an understanding of the changes in social structures during the gradual transition from the Nubian-Christian empire to the period of Ottoman rule. Additional research groups investigated the cemeteries, including funerary remains.
Notable landmarks.
Two notable buildings are the Kulubnarti fort, a fortified house which was converted into a castle, and the 13th-14th century domed Kulubnarti church. Graffito incised into the church building is depicted in three languages, Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian. East of the fort were four residential buildings of mud brick with stone plinth from the Christian era. There were inscriptions in the western house. Two of the houses had an upper floor, the ground floor being of brick walls and carefully hewn stones. The ceiling on the ground floor rooms consisted of three long, adjacent barrel vaults.
Prior Research at Kulubnarti.
Aside from the work of Adams several other research projects have been undertaken at Kulubnarti. Paul Sandberg provided an isotopic analysis of health and illness between the two cemeteries at Kulubnarti, site 21-S-46 and site 21-R-2.
Another study conducted by Kilgore et al. assessed the Kulubnarti sample for evidence and prevalence of traumatic injury. Kilgore et al. found that when compared to other comparative samples, two from North America and two from Europe, Kulubnarti demonstrated a higher prevalence of healed fractures, proportionately greater rates of multiple injuries and severity of injury was generally higher at Kulubnarti. The high prevalence of trauma and the severity of the injuries were largely attributed to the uneven and treacherous terrain in the Batn-El-Hajar.
Finally, Kulubnarti has also been utilized as a comparative sample to assess cross –cultural discrepancies in health, stress, disease, violent interaction and mortality levels throughout Sudanese Nubia. 
Archaeological Findings at Kulubnarti.
The excavation of Kulubnarti, organized by Adams, was completed under the auspices of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia. The main objective of the research team working at Kulubnarti was to clearly outline the cultural transition from Christianity to Islam using archaeological methods. Upon examination, the churches at Kulubnarti were all Christian in form and none of the structures showed evidence of being converted to a mosque. In fact, no mosques were uncovered in Kulubnarti, suggesting that the religious transition was not readily apparent from a study of the architectural remains. In similar vein, the artifactual remains also provided only minimal evidence of the transition from Christianity to Islam. The artifactual evidence of the cultural transition came in the form of several Islamic texts. The most informative aspect of Kulubnarti, pertaining to the religious conversion, was uncovered in the cemeteries of Kulubnarti. The two cemeteries excavated at Kulubnarti both clearly yield evidence of both Christian and Muslim graves. However, none of the graves could be dated in an attempt to pinpoint a more precise time for the religious conversion at Kulubnarti.

The Revolution Will Be Televised

The Revolution Will Be Televised is a British television satire show, which was first screened on BBC Three in August 2012. Writing for "The Guardian", Sam Wollaston said it's "Sacha Baron Cohen with a bit more substance then, or Mark Steel with a few more laughs".
At the 2013 British Academy Television Awards, the show won the BAFTA for the Best Comedy Programme.
Programme content.
The programme is a montage of satirical pranks and sketches carried out by Prowse and Rubinstein to "fight back" against "a world full of hypocrisy, corruption and greed." Sometimes assuming fictional characters, most of the show's content consists of the two presenters making a mockery of the wrongdoings of politicians, bankers, and that in other current affairs, in an attempt to try and emphasise its immorality. The public involved usually has no idea that what is being carried out is satire, and are usually fooled by the antics of Rubinstein and Prowse, which leads to some interesting reactions.
Episode list.
Series 2.
The second series of the show was first broadcast on BBC Three on 10 November 2013. Co-creator Jolyon Rubinstein confirmed via Twitter that the second series would start on 10 November 2013. Sam Wollaston of "The Guardian" said that "It's outrageous and audacious to the point that it's sometimes painful to watch. Hilarious, though".

"Something Holy" is the first single by Stellar Kart from the album "Everything Is Different Now". It was released on 9 March 2012, and charted at number 23 on the US Christian chart for eighteen weeks.
Composition.
Lyrically, the song speaks of how all people are born incomplete, and are born to be a part of something bigger. Lead vocalist Adam Agee explained to Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday, "The theme of this song is that although we’re going to go through tough times as believers God tells us that now we’re part of something holy. So we wanted to write a song that professed that truth." Agee also explained to Air 1, "It's a song of encouragement for people. Whatever I'm going through, I'm meant to be a part of something bigger than just my little struggle."

Take Me Home (One Direction album)

Take Me Home is the second studio album by British-Irish boy band One Direction, released on 9 November 2012 by Sony Music Entertainment. As a follow-up to One Direction's internationally successful debut album, "Up All Night" (2011), "Take Me Home" was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Largely recorded and composed in Sweden during 2012, Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, "What Makes You Beautiful" and "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album, and were able to shape melodies around the members' tones.
The album's songs are characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. "Take Me Home" garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.
Globally, the album topped the charts in more than 35 countries, and was the fourth best-selling album of 2012, selling 4.4 million units. The album's number-one debut on the US "Billboard" 200 chart made One Direction the first group to bow atop the "Billboard" 200 with their first two albums since American girl group Danity Kane entered with "Welcome to the Dollhouse" in 2008 and their self-titled debut in 2006. One Direction also became the second act in 2012 to achieve two number-one albums within a 12-month period, and the first boy band in US chart history to land two number-one albums in a calendar year. Their debut album and "Take Me Home" were the third and fifth best-selling albums of 2012 in the United States, respectively, making the band the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the Nielsen SoundScan era.
The album's lead single, "Live While We're Young", released on 28 September 2012, peaked inside the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist. The subsequent singles, "Little Things" and "Kiss You", were less successful, although the former topped the UK Singles Chart. To support the release, One Direction performed the album's songs on several televised programmes and during their worldwide Take Me Home Tour (2013).
Production.
In early 2012, One Direction revealed that a follow-up release to their debut album, "Up All Night" (2011), was in development. "In the summer, we're going to get back and start a new record. We want to bring out a record nearly every year, every year and a half," Niall Horan said, revealing they were arranging "meetings and stuff with different writers and producers." In March 2012, McFly frontman Tom Fletcher confirmed that he would be writing a song for the album. In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Ed Sheeran, and in June 2012, Sheeran confirmed that they were in contact: "I'm going into the studio in August to produce the tracks for them. I won't feature on the tracks though".
In April 2012, "The Independent" reported that Simon Cowell, the group's manager, had challenged prominent songwriters to compete for space on One Direction's second album. Dee Demirbag, responsible for repertoire at BMG Rights Management, a music publisher, in Scandinavia, said: "Breaking a boy band in the U.S. is about as big as it gets in the music industry, so you can imagine the competition to get cuts on the next One Direction album is immense". In addition, the article reported that Syco Records was working on candidates with Max Martin and Kristian Lundin. By August 2012, it was confirmed that album would feature work from veterans such as Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Shellback.
"Take Me Home" was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. "The Swedish-style songwriting: melody first" was predominantly utilised, according to "Time" correspondent Douglas Wolk. Savan Kotecha, Yacoub, and Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, "What Makes You Beautiful" and "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm, Sweden, developing songs for the album, and were able to shape melodies around their tones. Kotecha reflected: "We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is to make it sound like anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult". In addition, after viewing the international success of "What Makes You Beautiful", the trio conceptualised songs "that kids could play on guitar and cover on YouTube."
After extensive promotional appearances in support of their debut album, One Direction began recording the album in May 2012, in Stockholm, Sweden, at Kinglet Studios. In June 2012, the group continued recording the album in the United States, while touring on the final leg of their "Up All Night Tour". Horan, in a June interview with MTV News, disclosed that the group were intending to spend their time in July and August "getting the album done." Besides sessions in Kinglet Studios, recording sessions and mixing for the album took place at Chalice Studios in Los Angeles, MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Wendy House Productions in London, and Sticky Studios in Surrey, England.
Packaging.
The album cover artwork, revealed on 30 August 2012, features the group surrounding a traditional British K2 red telephone box, a familiar sight on the streets of the UK.
Music and lyrics.
The album's songs are characterised by metronomic rock-inherited pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, double entendres for sexual intercourse, a homogeneous sound and message, the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune, and rotations of lead vocals. Jon Caramanica, writing in "The New York Times", considered the album "far more mechanical" than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar. San Lansky, an editor for Idolator, described it as "’80s-inflected and intermittently rock-dappled," and as more indebted to the "sanitized punk crunch of McFly" than to teen pop.
Alexis Petridis, a music journalist, interpreted its signature sound as a "peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars," which, he said, is at least an improvement on the substitute R&B "that was once the grim lot of the boyband." The opening guitar riff of "Live While We're Young" has been noted as similar to that of The Clash's 1982 single, "Should I Stay or Should I Go", by some critics. According to Petridis, the guitar is played thrice between the riff with the plectrum stroking the strings, while it is pressed. One note in the chord is changed, which Petridis surmised was probably to avoid paying any royalty to the Clash. "Rock Me" has a clapping, mid-tempo beat that has been likened to that "We Will Rock You", a 1977 single by Queen.
The group's voices are presented individually on the record. Savan Kotecha noted that the Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of "Take Me Home" tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: "The fans can tell the difference, but we wanted to make sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as "Little Things," "Last First Kiss," "Back For You," and "They Don't Know About Us." Other tracks, like "Heart Attack," "Rock Me," "I Would," and "Over Again," have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.
Critical reception.
The album received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on nine reviews. Despite its "boardroom-defined objectives" and "safety", Al Fox, writing for BBC Music, considered the music itself "notable quality" and reliable. Matt Collar from Allmusic described it as an "immediately catchy mix of dancey pop that maximizes the group's shared lead-vocal approach and peppy, upbeat image." Kate Wills from "The Independent" praised the uptempo material while defining the ballads as jarring, a notion shared by John Dolan of "Rolling Stone". Although he dubbed it "actually pretty great – certainly better than it needs to be," Sam Lansky for Idolator thought the album is predictably generic, and interpreted it as "a little cynical, even as it excels in making some of the purest pop of the year."
"Entertainment Weekly" writer Adam Markovitz panned the record as an empty gesture and asserted that the album was rushed, signifying an album with "barely enough zip to keep the kids up past dinner." Likewise, Robert Copsey from "Digital Spy" wrote, "The result "Take Me Home" may see them progressing at a snail's pace, but when you've got it so good, what's the rush anyway?" In a mixed review, "The New York Times" contributor Jon Caramanica appreciated the album's sonic palette, but dismissed its lyricism as narrow and tedious, and Sheeran's contributions as "unusually lumpy in the hands of such a polished group". Caramanica characterised the members' vocals as "fundamentally interchangeable", and opined that only Zayn Malik "breaks free from the pack vocally with any regularity."
While he commended the album for its "variable quality", Alexis Petridis for "The Guardian" felt the record would not be able to transcend its target market, a core audience aged approximately 8 to 12 and female: "To anyone else, the mystery of One Direction's success – or at least the sheer scale of it – remains as opaque as ever." The latter view was shared by Ben Rayner of the "Toronto Star": "Unless you’re in the target demographic or are, perhaps, a mom who lived through the same thing in her youth, there's no point in even going near this record, of course, but the rest of us were never meant to in the first place." Writing for "HitFix", Melinda Newman maintained that the album "masterfully hits its target", and concluded as follows: "I’m so far out of the One Dimension demographic, I practically need a GPS to find it."

Their debut album and "Take Me Home" were the third and fifth best-selling albums of 2012 in the United States, respectively, making the band the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the Nielsen SoundScan era.
Promotion.
"Take Me Home" has yielded three singles, including two US singles. Its lead single, "Live While We're Young", was released by Syco Records on 28 September 2012. The song rocketed to worldwide success, peaking at number one in Ireland and New Zealand and the top ten in almost every country it charted in. In the United States, "Live While We're Young" debuted at number three on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart, sold 341,000 downloads in its first week, and bowed at number one on the Digital Songs chart. Its debut marks the highest bow by a British group and the second-highest debut among all UK acts, outpaced only by Elton John's number one arrival with "Candle in the Wind 1997". Its opening sales denote the biggest opening sales figure for a single by a non-US artist and the third ever for a download by a group, surpassed by the arrivals of Maroon 5's 2012 single, "Payphone" (493,000), and The Black Eyed Peas' 2009 single, "Boom Boom Pow" (465,000). "Little Things" was released in the UK and Ireland on 12 November 2012, as the second single. The track debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart of 18 November 2012, becoming One Direction's fifth top ten appearance and second number-one hit in the United Kingdom. "Kiss You", chosen as the second and final US single third and final overall single of "Take Me Home", was released digitally on 17 November 2012, according to MTV News.
The group and the album's lead single were featured in a Pepsi television commercial for the United States, which premiered on the Fox Broadcasting Company network on 10 October 2012. Columbia Records allowed the record to stream in full on iTunes in the week leading up to its 13 November 2012 release. In addition, One Direction promoted the album in a series of live appearances from October toward December, notably on television programmes "The X Factor USA", "The X Factor UK", "The Today Show", which drew a record crowd of 15.000 people to the Rockefeller Center, and the BBC's "Children in Need 2012" telethon. Additional live appearances include at the Royal Variety Performance, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, the Bambi Awards, and a headlining sold-out show at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The album's accompanying concert tour, the Take Me Home Tour, commenced at London's O2 Arena on 23 February 2013. The concert tour consists of over 100 shows in Australasia, Europe, and North America, and is set to visit arenas and stadiums from February through October 2013. Announced by member Liam Payne at the 2012 BRIT Awards in early 2012, the original concert tour was billed as the UK & Ireland Arena Tour. In mid-2012, the concert tour expanded with legs in North America and Australasia following the band's international breakthrough. In the UK and Ireland, ticket sales reached 300,000 within a day of release, which included a six-date sell out at the O2 Arena in London. In Australian and New Zealand markets, tickets grossed US$15.7 million, with all 190,000 tickets being sold for eighteen shows to be held in Australia and New Zealand.

Swan-class ship-sloop

The "Swan" class were built as a 14-gun class of ship sloops for the Royal Navy, although an extra 2 guns were added soon after completion.
Design.
The class was designed by the Surveyor of the Navy, John Williams, and two vessels to this design ("Swan" and "Kingfisher") were ordered in January 1766. Twenty-three more were ordered to the same design between 1773 and 1779; they formed the 'standard' ship sloop design of the British Navy during the American Revolutionary War, during which eleven of them were lost. Surviving vessels went on to serve during the French Revolutionary War and Napoleonic War.
The design provided for 16 gunports (8 per side, excluding the bridle-ports) but one pair was initially left unoccupied, and the ships were always rated at 14 guns. However an eighth pair of guns was added from 1780 onwards to utilise the vacant ports, without any change in the nominal rating.
The "Swan" class sloops were unusually attractive for the type of vessel. Not only did they have sleek hull lines but they also carried an unusual amount of decoration for their size. They were built just before the Admiralty issued orders that all vessels (especially lesser rates and unrated vessels) should have minimal decoration and carvings to save on costs, due to the seemingly ever-continuing war with France and other nations.
Construction.
Following the initial 1766 order for two ships, a second pair was ordered in 1773 ("Cygnet" and "Atalanta") and a further five in 1775 ("Pegasus" in April, "Fly" in August, and "Swift", "Dispatch" and "Fortune" in October); all these were built in the Royal Dockyards. Another five were contracted in November 1775 to be built by commercial shipbuilders ("Hound", "Hornet", "Vulture", "Spy" and "Cormorant"), and a further pair during 1776 ("Zebra" and "Cameleon"). Another two were ordered from the Royal Dockyards in January 1777 ("Fairy" and "Nymph") and a final seven from commercial constructors over the following 30 months ("Savage", "Fury", "Delight" and "Thorn" during 1777, "Bonetta" and "Shark" during 1778, and "Alligator" in 1779).

Richard Johnson (mayor)

Richard Johnson is an American politician and city manager who served as Mayor of Taunton, Massachusetts and City Manager of Lowell, Massachusetts.
Early career.
Prior to running for office, Johnson served as an administrative assistant to Taunton Mayor Theodore J. Aleixo, Jr. and as Director of the Taunton Housing Authority.
Mayor of Taunton.
In 1981, incumbent Mayor Joseph Amaral chose not to seek re-election and Johnson ran to succeed him. He finished first in the preliminary election with 4289 votes, defeating Amaral's administrative assistant Walter Precourt Jr. (2776 votes), City Councilman Tijuana Goldstein-Star (2729 votes), recent Syracuse University graduate David Goren (262 votes), and rock musician Russell N. Hurst (76 votes). He defeated Precourt in the general election 7266 votes to 6030.
During Johnson's first term, the city suffered economic misfortune as Parker Brothers and Paragon Gear shut down their Taunton plants.
Although the city suffered through an economic slump and high unemployment during Johnson's early years as mayor, by 1987 unemployment in Taunton was at the lowest point on record. In 1986, GTE chose Taunton as the location for its new plant. In 1989, The Pyramid Companies announced plans to build a mall in Taunton, which would become the Silver City Galleria.
In 1990, Johnson prevented hip hop group 2 Live Crew from performing in Taunton, stating that he wanted to protect his community from the potential for violence and from the band's "outward display of immorality".
In 1991, Johnson was defeated in his bid for a sixth term, losing to Robert Nunes 6922 votes to 6741.
City Manager of Lowell.
Shortly after his defeat, Johnson was chosen by the Lowell City Council to serve as City Manager. In 1992, Lowell lost control of its budget to the state finance commission due to its unstable financial condition. It regained control in 1995. That same year, the City Council approved bond sales for the Tsongas Center and Edward A. LeLacheur Park.

James N. Britton

James Nimmo Britton (18 May 1908 – 29 February 1994) was an influential British educator at the Institute of Education, University of London, whose theory of language and learning helped guide research in school writing, while shaping the progressive teaching of language, writing, and literature in both England and the United States after the Dartmouth Conference (1966) of Anglo-American English educators.
Biography.
Britton was born in Scarborough, England, on 18 May 1908. He graduated with a B.A. honours degree in English from University College London, where he held the Campbell Clarke Scholarship and the John Oliver Hobbes Memorial Scholarship. From 1933-1938, he taught English at Harrow Weald County Grammar School, in the state educational system.
In 1938, Britton left his teaching post to become education editor for the publishers John Murray of London. Soon afterwards, he joined the RAF in World War II. "Record and Recall: A Cretan Memoir" (1988) details an episode in his war experiences when he escaped being captured by German paratroopers who invaded the island of Crete where he helped to staff a radar station in 1941. Returning from overseas, Britton worked at John Murray for several years before completing his M.A. at the University of London. From 1948-1952 he also taught education at the Birmingham College of Art. 
In 1954, Britton joined the English Education Department at the University Of London Institute of Education where he spent the rest of his career, becoming Reader in Education, head of department, and eventually the Goldsmiths Professor. During the 1970s, he headed a major research group (including colleagues Nancy Martin and Harold Rosen) for the British Schools Council, which examined the instructional role of writing in the British Schools. This led to the publication of "The Development of Writing Abilities, 11-18" in 1975 and the refinement of his theory of language use, which distinguished between "participant" and "spectator" language roles. This work helped teachers to see the importance of having students use "expressive" language and foregrounded the crucial role of audience in the development of language abilities. At this time, Britton was also an active member of the Bullock Committee, which issued its influential report, "A Language for Life", in 1975.
Britton’s classic study "Language and Learning" (1970; 2nd Ed., 1992), contains his most fully developed statement about the relationship between children's active language use and their learning. Drawing on extensive samples of actual speech and writing done by his two daughters when they were growing up (Celia Britton, formerly Professor of French, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, and Alison Britton, one of England's leading ceramic artists), Britton showed how individuals use words to make both practical and moral sense of the world. He also helped to introduce, and make accessible, important psychological thinkers in the area of language, identity, and society, from the American George Kelly to the Russian Lev Vygotsky.
In 1982, his selected essays appeared in "Prospect and Retrospect"; and finally, with his last academic book "Literature in Its Place" (1993), Britton focused on the importance of poems and stories in people's lives.
Owing to his wide international reputation, Britton served as a visiting scholar in numerous institutions around the English-speaking world. In 1963, he worked with teachers in South Africa and later he travelled to Australia to advise and consult. In Canada, he was especially associated with the University of British Columbia, the University of Calgary, and the Ontario Institute of Education. In the United States, he spoke at numerous National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) conferences and held many visiting professorships, notably at Bread Loaf and New York University. The University of Calgary awarded him an honorary LL.D., and he received NCTE's David H. Russell award in 1977 for Distinguished Research in the Teaching of English. A collection, "The Word for Teaching Is Learning", was published in 1988 to honor his eightieth birthday. In addition, the Conference on English Education recognizes Britton's important influence on English teachers throughout the world by annually selecting a winner of the James N. Britton Award for Inquiry in English Language Arts.
Britton also worked hard at establishing professional networks for teachers of English. In 1947, he helped found the London Association for the Teaching of English (LATE), which eventually led to the founding of the National Association for the Teaching of English (NATE) in the UK in 1963. His commitment to helping initiate and sustain an international conversation among teachers of English began with his role as a member of the British delegation to the Dartmouth Conference of 1966. In 1971, at the University of York, Britton was a key supporter of the first grassroots International Conference with its call for language and writing across the curriculum. In 1984, he edited "English Teaching: An International Exchange" for the International Federation for the Teaching of English (IFTE).

Clement Marfo &amp; The Frontline

Clement Marfo & The Frontline are an English music group formed in London, England. The group's members are diverse in many genres of music. Their songs are based around a grime and hip-hop core, with elements of rock brought in by the various members of the band.
History.
The band was initially founded by Clement and Dion. Clement started his career as a hip-hop MC, but soon wanted to have a live band to work with and to dabble in the rock scene. Dion, who Clement met through a mutual friend, introduced Clement to Rich, Dan, Stacey, and Jonny. Previously, Clement had found vocalist Kojo on Myspace and wanted to work with him too, leading to the formation of The Frontline. Although he has been shown to rap, Dion became the band's drummer.
The group have worked with producer Iain James, known for working with Professor Green and Wretch 32. They have supported the likes of Plan B, Rizzle Kicks, and De La Soul. The group were named a nominee on MTV's Brand New for 2012, and were tipped as T4's Rising Stars of 2012.
Their song "Champion" was used as one of the unofficial songs to support the London 2012 Olympics. It was also used as the official theme song of the WWE Royal Rumble pay-per-view in 2013, specifically in the buildup for the main event match between CM Punk and The Rock, and on the soundtrack of the video game "F1 2011". Their song "Us Against the World" was featured on the soundtrack of the video game "FIFA 13".
The group has collaborated with artists such as Ghetts on "Overtime", Kano on "Mayhem", and Sway on "It's My Time". After announcing a series of solo shows throughout May and June, it has been mentioned that Clement is taking a break from The Frontline.

She placed fourth over 5000 metres at the Ukrainian Championship in 2010, running a time of 16:16.55 minutes, and placed third at the Koscian half marathon. She made her debut in the marathon the following year and her win at the Cracovia Marathon in a time of 2:28:14 hours brought her selection for the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, where she managed 15th place.
The 2012 season was a career breakthrough for Hamera-Shmyrko. She broke the Ukrainian record at the Osaka Women's Marathon with a run of 2:24:46 hours, ending the race as runner-up to Risa Shigetomo. After that, she ran a series of personal bests: she ran 33:25 minutes at the World's Best 10K, 72:15 minutes at the Prague Half Marathon, and 32:50.13 for the 10,000 metres at the Prefontaine Classic.

François Marie, Chevalier de Reggio

Francesco Maria de Reggio, known in French as François Marie, Chevalier de Reggio (Alba, Italy, 1698–New Orleans, 1787) was an Italian nobleman who was a member of the House of Este. He was a distinguished commander in the War of the Austrian Succession, and an influential government official in Louisiana.
Biography.
François Marie was born in Alba, Piedmont, in 1698. He was nephew to the reigning Duke of Modena and Reggio, Francesco III d'Este. His mother was Felicite De Canapan, and his father was Rinaldo de Reggio, Chevalier de Reggio, who was the brother of Duke Francesco, and son of Duke Rinaldo d'Este. When his father died, Francois himself became the Chevalier de Reggio. He ruled his lands strongly for many years, but fell victim to boredom. Looking for excitement, Francois moved to France, joined the French army, and fought in the War of the Austrian Succession with his close friend, the Duke of Richelieu. He proved to be an excellent soldier, and went on to distinguish himself greatly at the Siege of Bergen op Zoom. King Louis XV of France was so impressed by the Chevalier's valour during the siege, that he gave him a captaincy in the French army, and promoted him to the rank of Captain general. Soon after his promotion in 1747, the king sent Marie to Louisiana, which was a French colony at the time.
François held the title of Captain-General of Louisiana until 1763, when the Spanish Empire took over the French colony. The Chevalier was well liked by the new Spanish officials, and was given a new title in the government of Spanish Louisiana: First Justiciary of the Estates and Property of the Crown. While holding this position, he met a young woman, by the name of Fleuriau. They married, and had many children. In his old age, Francois retired, and died in New Orleans, in 1787.
Famous descendants.
Francois Marie, Chevalier de Reggio was the great-grandfather of Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard, one of the most famous generals in the American Civil War.

<doc id="36640665" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36640665" title="The Bear Bryant Show">
The Bear Bryant Show

The Bear Bryant Show was a weekly coaches' show that served as a weekly recap of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team's previous day's game. The show ran during the tenure of former head coach Paul "Bear" Bryant from the 1958 through the 1982 seasons. Co-hosted by John Forney (1961–1965), Bill Austin (1966), Charley Thornton (1967–1981) and Steadman Shealy (1982), "The Bear Bryant Show" was a cultural phenomenon within the state of Alabama that contributed to the rise in popularity and awareness of the university's football program during the 1960s and 70s. The show ran for an hour during its entire run.
History.
As part of Bryant's contract with the University, he retained all of the rights to Alabama football game films. As such, he became one of the first collegiate football head coaches to have his own television program with the start of the "The Bear Bryant Show" in 1958. Bryant was paid $3,000 per show and insisted on it being an hour long in order to cover the game in its entirety and for its perceived recruiting benefits. In 1966, the show became one of the first television shows produced in the state of Alabama to be broadcast in color.
During the 25-year run of the program, several persons served as its co-host alongside Bryant. From the 1961 through 1965 seasons, the show was co-hosted by former Alabama broadcaster John Forney. Bill Austin, Sports Director of WCFT-TV Tuscaloosa co-hosted the 1966 season, Charley Thornton was later brought on as co-host and served alongside coach Bryant through the 1981 season. At the conclusion of that season, Thornton left Alabama to become an executive athletics director at Texas A&M University. In September 1982, former Crimson Tide quarterback Steadman Shealy was selected to serve as the co-host for the show. The announcement was made by the producer of the program, Sloan-Major Advertising. The show ended at the conclusion of the 1982 season with the retirement of Bryant as head coach of the Crimson Tide. During its run, over 250 episodes were produced and for several years the show was one of the highest-rated syndicated television shows in the country.
Although over 250 episodes were produced, only 77 episodes survive on tape. So few recordings of the show remain as a result of both the show being aired live, and many of the videotapes used to record the show in the 1970s being reused week-to-week. Many of the tapes that date back to the 1970s were recorded at the request of the father of former Alabama halfback Mike Stock, so he could watch highlights of his son with the Crimson Tide. In 1992, Golden Flake and Coke donated the 77 surviving episodes to the Paul W. Bryant Museum, and in 2001 an exhibition that featured the show called "Sundays at Four" opened at the Bryant Museum. Efforts to re-release the show on DVD have been discussed at various times, but have yet to yield fruit.
Sponsors.
The title sponsors of the show were the Birmingham Coca-Cola Bottling Company and Golden Flake Snack Foods. Their slogan was "a great pair, says the Bear," and each episode opened with Bryant and his co-host opening a bag of Golden Flake potato chips and bottles of Coca-Cola.
Legacy.
Culturally, the show reflected many of the values of the state in the way Bryant spoke about the game but in how he spoke about God, family and country. The ability of Bryant to connect with the fan base through the show helped to both "create and and sustain the legend of Bear Bryant" as observed by Keith Dunnavant. During the 1960s and 70s, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules prohibited teams from appearing in more than two televised games on ABC per season. As such, "The Bear Bryant Show" became the primary way that fans of the Crimson Tide from across the state were able to see the games. For years, the show aired on Sundays at 4:00 p.m., and its popularity regularly caused many of the stations that carried it to preempt live coverage of National Football League games during the same timeslot. In addition to providing the fans a way to see highlights from the weekly games, the show was also watched by Crimson Tide players to see what coach Bryant had to say about their individual performances.

Greenlink Cycle Path

The route.
The path begins at the Bothwellhaugh Roman Fort in Strathclyde Country Park, and travels through the woodland area of the park, going over the West Coast Main Line. The path then goes through Bellshill golf course and along the south-east of the town, then travelling over the South Calder Water and the A721. It by-passes the Forgewood suburb of Motherwell heading towards Braidhurst High School, and subsequently travels under the Argyle Line heading towards the new site of the Cathedral Primary School and Fir Park nursery joint campus. The path concludes when it runs through the residential housing area and stops at the Aquatec sports centre next door to the town centre.
Future Plans.
There are plans in future to extend the cycle path beyond Motherwell town centre to connect to the new town of Ravenscraig. The initial plans prior to formation of the path was to create a direct route from Strathclyde Park to the site of the former Ravenscraig steelworks. Those plans were put on hold due to the delay in the regeneration of Ravenscraig, and so the link only stops at Motherwell town centre.
Awards.
In 2011, the cycle path received the Level 3 "It's Your Neighbourhood " award from Beautiful Scotland for developing. That same year, the cycle path also received an award for "Scotland's finest Woodland", presented to them by the Minister for Environment and Climate Change, Stewart Stevenson, at the Royal Highland Show.

Blackheart (plant disease)

Blackheart is a non-parasitic disease of the fruit of cultivated plants, such as tomatoes, that causes them to rot from the inside. External signs of the disease may or may not be present. The internal blackening develops in plants exposed to environmental pathology such as drought conditions or poor soil.
Blossom-end rot.
Blossom-end rot is another sign of plant disease that may accompany blackheart in the same plant. A black rot originates around the stem area of the plant fruit (the "blossom-end") and spreads over the fruit as a dark, hardened area. The causes of blossom-end rot and blackheart are the same.
Causes and treatment.
The most common cause of blossom-end rot and/or blackheart is exposure to a prolonged hot, or drought period. These plant pathologies may also be caused by an extremely low calcium mineral content in the soil. 
Plant fruit that is afflicted by either blossom-end rot or blackheart should be picked and discarded, leaving the healthy fruit on the plant. While the condition is not contagious and it will not spread from fruit to fruit, removing affected fruit will enable the plant to concentrate strength towards the healthier parts of the plant. Additional water should be added to a plant suffering from the effects of a hot, dry spell. If low calcium in the soil is the cause, this can be treated with calcium-rich fertilizers, such as gypsum, limestone, or ground eggshells.

United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013

The United Kingdom participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malmö, Sweden. The British entry was selected through an internal selection, organised by the British broadcaster BBC. Bonnie Tyler represented United Kingdom with the song "Believe in Me" composed by Desmond Child, Lauren Christy and Christopher Braide. Tyler finished in 19th place with a score of 23 points in the final.
Background.
The first official statement on UK participation in Eurovision 2013 was made on 17 January 2013, with the BBC's Eurovision semi-finals commentator Scott Mills stating that he would be hearing the UK's song "next week" – indicating that the BBC had made an internal selection decision on a UK entrant for Eurovision 2013, rather than heeding demands subsequent to Eurovision 2012 for a return for a national round to select the UK representative for Eurovision - see .
In December 2012, the "Metro" published an unconfirmed report that Girls Aloud would be representing the UK at Eurovison 2013. On 19 January 2013, "Aftonbladet", a leading newspaper in the 2013 Eurovision host nation Sweden, reported that Girls Aloud member Kimberly Walsh would be the contest's UK representative with an entry written by Fredrik Kempe, a Swedish composer who'd placed three compositions at previous Eurovision editions. Walsh had indeed cut tracks for her solo debut album with Kempe in Sweden, giving credence to the rumour of her Eurovision involvement.
On 25 February, UK blogger The Kickdrum leaked Bonnie Tyler's identity as the UK representative at Eurovision 2013 as a blind item: "...as rumoured it is a female solo artist. But it’s not who you think it is. In fact, we’d wager that (although you will know the artist) you’d never guess in a million years. But once you get over the shock, you’ll be pleasantly surprised." Social media speculation on The Kickdrum blind item largely hypothesized that the reference was to Bonnie Tyler, who besides having a new album set for release, had just set up a new website, Facebook page and Twitter account, indicating an anticipation of social media interest.
However, spurious identifications of the UK representative at Eurovision 2013 continued to occur. On 1 March 2013, "Metro", who previously had incorrectly named Girls Aloud as the act UK was sending to Eurovision 2013, reported that Alesha Dixon would be the UK representative, while the same day the "Daily Mail", in an evidently misconstrued leak of Bonnie Tyler's Eurovision participation, identified the UK representative as musical stage actress Bonnie Langford.
Internal selection.
The official announcement that Bonnie Tyler would represent the United Kingdom with the song "Believe in Me" was made on 7 March 2013. Tyler is the fifth Welsh-born solo act to represent the UK at Eurovision, following Mary Hopkin (1970), Emma (1990), Jessica Garlick (2002) and James Fox (2004). To date, the only Welsh-born person to sing on a winning Eurovision entrant is Nicky Stevens of Brotherhood of Man, that group having secured Eurovision victory for the UK in 1976 with "Save Your Kisses For Me".
According to Bonnie Tyler, the arrangement for Tyler to represent the UK at Eurovision 2013 with "Believe in Me" was made around Christmas 2012 but kept confidential until the official 7 March 2013 announcement. The song had been written independently of any intent of Eurovision entry being recorded for Tyler's "Rocks and Honey" album: according to Tyler an advance copy of the album came to the attention of the BBC resulting in an offer being made for her to represent the UK at Eurovision 2013 with "Believe in Me". Tyler has stated the BBC had attempted to recruit her to represent the UK at Eurovision in 1983: "I was in America at the time where I was #1 for four weeks "Total Eclipse of the Heart" so it wasn’t the right time", adding: "But this is the perfect time."
On 11 May, BBC Three aired a two hour special called "How To Win Eurovision" presented by Greg James and Russell Kane. Former United Kingdom representatives Bucks Fizz, Sonia, Jemini, Javine, Daz Sampson, Scooch and Josh Dubovie appeared on the show.
At Eurovision.
As a member of the "Big Five", United Kingdom automatically qualified for a place in the final, to be held on 18 May 2013. In addition to their participation in the final, United Kingdom was assigned to vote in the first semi-final on 14 May 2013. In the final Bonnie achieved 19th out of 26th and got 23 points, which is the third highest placing for the United Kingdom, since 2006.
During the British delegation's press conference on 15 May, United Kingdom was allocated to perform in the second half of the final. In the final, the producers of the show decided that the United Kingdom would perform 15th, following Romania and preceding Sweden.

Kuzman Šapkarev Primary School (Dračevo)

Kuzman Šapkarev Primary School (alternative spellings include Kuzman Shapkarev or Kuzman Šapkarev; ) is a state-owned primary school in the suburb of Dracevo (), located 10 km south from the downtown of Skopje, capital of Macedonia.
The school was established in 1971 (starts working January 1, 1972), when the older schools located in Dracevo, Rajko Zhinzifov Primary School and Kliment Ohridski Primary School, became too small for the rising number of students, mostly due to the new-comers in the suburb after the 1963 Skopje earthquake. Kuzman Shapkarev Primary School is located in a totally renovated (2006-2011) building, which offers all the necessary conditions for a modern and interactive teaching of the pupils. As part of the school there are fully functional kitchen, sports hall and dentist office. As state's laws in Macedonia proclaim, all the school cabinets and labs are fully furnished with computers and comfortable chairs and desks that allow normal and healthy development of children.
Kuzman Shapkarev Primary School bears the name of one of a prominent ethnographer, folklorist and textbook writer from the 19th and beginning of the 20th century. The date of his death, March 18, is celebrated as the school day with a ceremony and sport and cultural tournaments.
The students of the school regularly participate and achieve excellent results in the regional math competitions and quizzes, as well as national chemistry, history, Macedonian Language etc. competitions. In the preparations for these competitions, especially active are the teachers from the subject teaching programmes, who try to build a friendly and cooperative relationship with the students. Also, very active in promoting the school and achieving medals and trophies are the students participating in one of the many sport clubs, the most active are the ones from the handball and basketball school teams, since these are the most popular sports in the country.
A few years ago the school started a new tradition in choosing the laureate of the graduating class. The list of the laureates in the last years goes as:

Kulubnarti church

The Kulubnarti church is located on the island of Kulubnarti, village of Kulb, in Northern Sudan. The island is situated between the 2nd and 3rd cataracts of the Nile, about southwest of Wadi Halfa, in the Batn-El-Hajar region.
History.
Somers Clarke published a sketch in 1912 of the island's church, its walls made of mud bricks. In 1964, Peter Grossmann discovered its vault and placed it upright. In the 1930s, the unusual central structure was recognized by Clarke and Ugo Monneret de Villard as being unique. The anthropologists William Yewdale Adams and Peter Grossmann date the church to the 13th or 14th century, Adams having dated pottery finds in the church to that period, and Grossman concurring with the dating on the basis of stylistic comparisons. Greek, Coptic, and Old Nubian language graffito was incised within the church. The church paintings, described by Adams in his 1994 book, were moved to the National Museum of Sudan in Khartoum.
Architecture.
The small building has an almost square central area. The floor plan, roughly analogous to common village churches of Nubia, was simplified as a whole. The rectangular area of about is unique. Unlike most churches, the building had Nubian features in the middle of the long sides but also contained rectangular niches. There was a U-shaped altar area. Behind the apse, to the east, there was a vestibule, in addition to two symmetrically arranged rooms, each with a door. The entire building consisted of mud bricks with a single layer of rough stones at ground level. 
There are two long walls with arches, just over in height at the peak. On the east wall, there is a rectangular, bifurcated chancel with lateral side rooms, which were entered from the aisles. In the west wall, there were three pairs of slit windows and a division into three nearly equal-sized rooms. The corners of the west wall were separated from other rooms. The two rectangular brick masonry pillars and wall corners of the western side rooms linked arches. Another slit opening connected the northwestern side room with the naos. 
There are two central pillars in the middle apse. The nave, after deduction of the side rooms, was nearly twice as wide as long and apparently windowless. A horizontal, cylindrical attachment was found on spherical pendentives. On the inside of the south wall, remains of paint are visible, with fragmentary inscriptions elsewhere, and incised graffito in three languages. In the niches of the north and south sides, and in the east wall, there were paired slit windows towards the top. Remains of wall paintings were found in the southeast corner. In the 1960s, the central part of the north wall and the southern half of the apse were made upright to the base of the vault; the western outer wall had completely collapsed.
In the southern room, a double flight of stairs led to two platformed areas around a pillar by the roof. One section of the roof probably had window openings: there was a square wall segment, and then a central round dome. The dome towered far above the longitude of the three adjacent barrel-vaulted rooms. The shape of the roof could be reconstructed from the visible vault approaches that were available at almost every wall. The naos bulged with an inner diameter of , and held the largest circular dome of Nubia. The design of a Nubian vault manufactured dome was a structure of eight equal arches, built upon a central square area. This corresponds to the principle of the Middle Byzantine building style of eight columns. This design was used by a few churches on the Greek islands and the church of Deir El Quseir, a few kilometers south of Cairo, however, no other church in Nubia used the supporting structure of the dome found at the Kulb church. It is also the only known church in Nubia with a raised central dome tambour. The only known church which compared with this one at Kulb was a traditional church in a poor condition in the courtyard of the temple in Bait al-Wali, dated to the 8th century, and part of the 1960s UNESCO rescue operation due to the Aswan dam.

85th New York State Legislature

The 85th New York State Legislature, consisting of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, met from January 7 to April 23, 1862, during the fourth year of Edwin D. Morgan's governorship, in Albany.
Background.
Under the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1846, 32 Senators and 128 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (four districts) and Kings County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of entire towns, or city wards, forming a contiguous area, all within the same county. 
At this time there were two major political parties: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Democrats split over the civil war issue. The War Democrats nominated an "Independent People's" ticket which was almost completely endorsed by the Republicans, and became known as the Union ticket; the rump Democratic Party, favoring a compromise with the South and later known as Copperheads, nominated an opposing ticket. In New York City the Democrats were split into two factions: Tammany Hall and Mozart Hall.
Elections.
The New York state election, 1861 was held on November 5. Of the nine statewide elective offices up for election, eight were carried by Union men, and one by a Democrat. The approximate party strength at this election, as gathered from the vote for Secretary of State and the short-term Canal Commissioner was: Democrats 190,000; Republicans 180,000; and War Democrats 117,000. 
Sessions.
The Legislature met for the regular session at the Old State Capitol in Albany on January 7, 1862; and adjourned on April 23.
Henry J. Raymond (U) was elected again Speaker with 88 votes against 36 for Horatio Seymour (D).
On January 30, the Legislature elected Victor M. Rice to succeed Henry H. Van Dyck as Superintendent of Public Instruction.
On February 11, James A. Bell was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate.

Seymour v. Superintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary

Seymour v. Superintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary, 368 U.S. 351 (1962), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States that the state of Washington did not have jurisdiction to try an Indian (Native American) for a crime committed within the boundaries of the Colville Indian Reservation, even if the crime was committed on land now owned by a non-Indian.
Background.
History.
Paul Seymour was an enrolled member of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, a group of twelve Indian tribes that are based at the Colville Indian Reservation. The reservation is located in the western part of Oregon and the eastern part of Washington. The reservation was established by the executive order of President Ulysses S. Grant on 2 July 1872. In 1892, Congress opened up part of the reservation to white settlement. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson, with Congressional authorization, opened up more reservation land for settlement.
Lower courts.
Seymour was charged with burglary in Okanogan County, Washington and pleaded guilty to attempted burglary. He was sentenced to 7-1/2 years in the state penitentiary. While incarcerated, he filed a petition for a writ of "habeas corpus" in the Washington Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court denied the petition on the grounds that the offense did not take place in "Indian country". Indian country is defined in federal law as including all land within an Indian reservation, and within Indian country, only the Federal government has jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians. The court reasoned that the Congressional action that had opened the Colville Indian Reservation to settlement had reduced or diminished the size of the reservation and since the crime was committed outside of the diminished reservation, it was not in Indian country. The court denied the writ. Seymour then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the appeal and granted a writ of certiorari.
Opinion of the court.
Arguments.
Glen A. Wilkinson argued the case for Seymour. Washington Assistant Attorney General Stephen C. Way argued the case for the state of Washington. At the request of the court United States Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin filed a memorandum with the court.
Unanimous opinion.
Justice Hugo Black announced the opinion of a unanimous court. Black looked to the statutes that affected the Colville Indian Reservation and noted that the 1892 act expressly reserved the southern half for use of the tribes under control of the federal government. The 1916 presidential proclamation merely set forth the procedure for settlement, and neither the proclamation nor the enabling act had any language terminating the reservation. Black further noted that a 1956 statute recognized the continued existence of the reservation, and a 1953 statute explained how the state could obtain jurisdiction once certain conditions were met. Black observed that those conditions had not yet been met. The statutes opening up the reservation to settlement merely allowed non-Indians to move onto the reservation and did not end reservation status.
Black stated that "Since the burglary with which petitioner was charged occurred on property plainly located within the limits of that reservation, the courts of Washington had no jurisdiction to try him for that offense." The case was reversed and remanded to the Washington Supreme Court.

Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting

On August 5, 2012, Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people and wounded four others at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Page took his life by shooting himself in the head after he was shot in the stomach by a responding police officer.
Page was an American white supremacist and United States Army veteran from Cudahy, Wisconsin. Apart from the shooter, all of the dead were members of the Sikh faith. The incident drew responses from President Barack Obama and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Dignitaries attended candlelight vigils in countries such as the U.S., Canada, and India. The First Lady Michelle Obama visited the temple on August 23, 2012.
Incident.
Following emergency calls around 10:25 a.m. CDT, police responded to a shooting at a Sikh "gurdwara" located in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. On arrival, they engaged the gunman, later identified as Wade Michael Page, who had shot several people at the temple, killing six. Page wounded an officer; after being shot in the stomach by another, he fatally shot himself in the head. He was armed with a Springfield XD(M) 9-millimeter semi-automatic pistol. Page had legally purchased the gun in Wisconsin. Four people were killed inside the temple, and three people, including Page, died outside. Page killed five men and one woman, ranging in age from 39 to 84. 
Three men were transported to Froedtert Hospital, including one of the responding officers.
Initial reports said the gunman had died from being shot by police officers at the scene, but the FBI later clarified that Page, after being shot by an officer, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
Authorities released an audio recording of the incident, made while the first responding officer, Lieutenant Brian Murphy, was shot by the gunman. It contained the words "I have someone walking out the driveway towards me. Man with a gun, white t-shirt," followed by the sound of gunfire. In September 2012, authorities released video recordings taken by squad cars during the incident, including the moments when Murphy was shot, and the gunman being shot by another officer. Murphy was shot fifteen times by Page, but survived.
The temple was preparing "langar", a Sikh communal meal, for later in the day. Witnesses suggested that women and children would have been at the temple preparing for the meal at the time of the incident, as children’s classes were scheduled to begin at 11:30 a.m.
The Joint Terrorism Task Force investigated the site, and police were treating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism. Oak Creek police handed the investigation over to the FBI. They were also investigating possible ties to white supremacist groups and other racial motivations. The FBI said there was no reason to think anyone else was involved in the attack, and they were not aware of any past threat made against the temple. US Attorney General Eric Holder described the incident as "an act of terrorism, an act of hatred, a hate crime."
Victims.
The six victims killed included one woman: Paramjit Kaur, 41; and five men: Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65, the founder of the Gurdwara; Prakash Singh, 39, an assistant priest; Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; and Suveg Singh, 84. All of the male victims wore turbans as part of their Sikh faith. Four of the victims were Indian nationals, while the rest were Americans. 
The injured included a responding officer, Lt. Brian Murphy, who was shot fifteen times at close range, including once in the neck. He was discharged from the hospital on August 22, 2012. Sikhs for Justice, a New York-based group, pledged a $10,000 award to Murphy. Two Sikh residents of Yuba City, California donated another $100,000 to officer Murphy for his heroic act and bravery.
Perpetrator.
Wade Michael Page (November 11, 1971 – August 5, 2012) was an American white supremacist then living in Cudahy, Wisconsin. Page was born and grew up in Colorado. He served in the U.S. Army from April 1992 through October 1998, before being forced out by a general discharge. In the Army, Page had learned to repair the Hawk missile system, before becoming a psychological operations specialist. He was demoted and received a general discharge for "patterns of misconduct," including being drunk while on duty and going absent without leave. 
After his discharge, Page returned to Colorado, living in the Denver suburb of Littleton from 2000 through 2007. Page worked as a truck driver from 2006 to 2010, but was fired after receiving a citation for impaired driving due to drinking.
Page had ties to white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups, and was reportedly a member of the Hammerskins. He entered the white power music scene in 2000, becoming involved in several neo-Nazi bands. He founded the band End Apathy in 2005 and played in the band Definite Hate, both considered racist white-power bands by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Page's former step-mother apologized to the Sikh victims and said she had not been in touch with her stepson for the past twelve years, after divorcing his father. A former friend described him as a "loner" and said he had talked about an "impending racial holy war." According to his neighbors, Page lived alone, rarely left his apartment, and avoided eye contact with them.
Page legally purchased the handgun used in the shooting on July 28, 2012 at a gun shop in West Allis, Wisconsin. Page passed the background checks required, and paid cash for the gun, along with three 19-round magazines. The owner of the gun shop said that Page's appearance and demeanor in the shop "raised no eyebrows whatsoever."
Following the shooting, photographs of Page appeared in media reports showing him with a range of tattoos on his arms and upper body, which were said to show his links to white supremacist organizations.
Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards declined to speculate on the motive behind the attack, saying "I don't know why, and I don't know that we'll ever know, because when he died, that died with him what his motive was or what he was thinking."
Reactions.
President Barack Obama offered his condolences, calling the Sikh community "a part of our broader American family," and ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half-staff until August 10 to honor the victims. Obama called for "soul searching" on how to reduce violence. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and other officials also issued statements of sympathy for the victims of the shooting and their families. Nancy Powell, the United States Ambassador to India, attended prayers for the victims at Gurudwara Bangla Sahib in New Delhi.
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, himself a Sikh, said that the attack being at a Sikh temple added to the pain, and stated that India stood in support of all peace-loving Americans who condemned the shooting. Following the incident, there were vigils as well as some protests against the United States by Sikhs in India.
Many Sikh Americans did not approve of the protests in India against the United States, and strongly condemned the actions, such as flag-burnings, taken by the protesters. U.S.-based Sikh community groups pledged assistance to the victims and their families, and urged Sikh Americans to organize interfaith vigils. They also organized to send an emergency response team to Wisconsin. 
Many other Americans held candlelight vigils in support of the Sikh community, and dignitaries such as Governor Walker attended. Congressman Paul Ryan introduced a bill in Congress condemning the tragedy which stated the House "condemns the senseless attack." On September 19, 2012, a Congressional hearing addressed hate crimes in response to the tragedy, before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights convened by Senator Dick Durbin.
In the aftermath of the shooting, Amar Kaleka, the son of Kaleka Singh, became involved in politics, supporting gun control and new legislation to reduce hate crimes. Kaleka criticized President Barack Obama, who visited the sites of other mass shootings, but not the Sikh Temple. As a member of the Democratic Party, Kaleka is running for the United States House of Representatives in in the 2014 election, challenging incumbent Paul Ryan.

<doc id="36641157" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36641157" title="California Clay Movement">
California Clay Movement

The California Clay Movement (or American Clay Revolution) was a school of ceramic art that emerged in California in the 1950s.
The movement was part of the larger transition in crafts from "designer-craftsman" to "artist-craftsman".
The editor of "Craft Horizons", New York-based Rose Slivka, became an enthusiastic advocate of the movement.
Peter Voulkos.
Peter Voulkos was one of the driving forces in the movement.
He established the Ceramic Center at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now the Otis College of Art and Design), 
where he created massive, abstract ceramic sculptures.
He felt that his free-form ceramic works were like jazz compositions: improvisational and free spirited.
Voulkos began creating ever larger ceramic works to break away from the conventional arts and crafts of his day.
Some of his work, named "plates", "ice buckets" or "tea bowls", were "deconstructed" traditional forms of glazed pottery. Others, such as his "stacks", were non-utilitarian and purely sculptural.
During a career that lasted almost half a century, Voulkos made over 200 "stacks", some as much as in height. 
Writing about the clay movement in 1963, a reviewer in "Time Magazine" said "Peter Voulkos' rough, ragged monuments are powerful weapons against the slick coffee-table pottery that often passes for modern art, and already a generation of fierce West Coast individualists has joined him at the barricades."
Pupils.
Voulkos profoundly influenced John Mason and Kenneth Price.
Voulkos turned the Los Angeles County Art Institute into an important center for ceramic art between 1954 and 1959. Moving to the University of California in Berkeley he and sculptors such as Sidney Gordon and Harold Paris developed an influential school of sculpture.
His pupils included Kenneth Price, Billy Al Benson, Robert Arneson and Stan Bitters.
The work of Voulkos, Arneson and others typified Californian art in the 1950s and 1960s, and was featured in many exhibitions.
Stephen De Staebler was another influential sculptor working mostly in clay and bronze who has been associated with the California Clay movement.
A reviewer said of him that "He practically invented his own art form by beating and buckling tons of clay into awesome mountainous landscapes, but his human sculptures are also very moving."
Michael Frimkess is another master of the California clay movement.
Frimkess was a student of Peter Voulkos, and adopted the abstract expressionist style of sculpture taught by Voulkos.
Influence.
Voulkos had huge influence, not just on potters and sculptors but even on painters.
Awareness of the movement quickly spread.
In 1959 the Guyanese artist Donald Locke obtained a grant to study for a Masters degree in fine arts at Edinburgh College of Art, a school in the University of Edinburgh.
There he met the artists Dave Cohen, Sheldon Kaganof and Dion Myers, who introduced the ideas of the California Clay Movement to Britain.
For many years his work reflected their influence.

Mark Twain Memorial Bridge (1936)

The Mark Twain Memorial Bridge was a Cantilevered Through Truss Bridge carrying US 36 over the Mississippi River. It was replaced in 2000 with the extension of I-72 and subsequently demolished.
History.
The bridge was opened in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and entered Missouri at the foot of Cardiff Hill which appeared in Twain's books The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. A crosswalk crossed the highway, connecting the Twain boyhood home with the lighthouse at the top of the hill. It originally carried the two-lane US Route 36, but with the extension of Interstate 72 west across Missouri, a new bridge was needed and was built to the north of the original bridge. On the Missouri side, the bridge ran into downtown Hannibal, just north of Hill Street. On the Illinois side, the route connected to present-day Illinois Route 106 (Old US 36), now served by I-72's Exit 1 to go east to Hull, Pittsfield, and points beyond.
Replacement.
In the late 1990s, construction started on a new bridge to carry I-72 west into Hannibal (I-72 turned into I-172 at milepost 4). Increased traffic on the deteriorating, old, narrow bridge was also a contributing factor. After the new bridge opened in 2000, the bridge was demolished. Today, only the Western abutment remains with informational signs along the old roadway.

Kind (horse)

Kind (foaled 21 April 2001) is an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. She won six of her thirteen races, including the Listed Flower of Scotland Stakes and Kilvington Stakes, as well as being placed in the Group 3 Ballyogan Stakes. Since retiring from racing she has become one of Juddmonte Farms' top broodmares, foaling the undefeated, 10-time Group 1 winner Frankel. All of her first five foals have won races, including the Group winners Bullet Train and Noble Mission. Kind was trained by Roger Charlton and owned by Khalid Abdulla.
Background.
Kind is a bay mare who was bred by Juddmonte Farms and foaled on 21 April 2001. She was sired by Danehill who won the Haydock Sprint Cup in 1989. He went on to become a leading sire and was champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Danehill also sired Danehill Dancer, Dansili, Duke of Marmalade, Dylan Thomas, George Washington and Rock of Gibraltar. Kind's dam is Rainbow Lake, a daughter of Rainbow Quest. Rainbow Lake won three of her six starts, including the Lancashire Oaks. Kind was trained by Roger Charlton.
Racing career.
2003: Two-year-old season.
Kind made her racecourse debut on 5 September 2003 in a six-furlong maiden race at Kempton Park. She was slowly away at the start, but ran on strongly in the closing stages to finish in third place, about two and a half lengths behind winner Unshooda. One month later Kind started as the odds-on favourite for another six-furlong maiden at Newmarket. She was slowly away again and finished fourth, four lengths behind winner Valjarv.
2004: Three-year-old season.
In her first start as a three-year-old, on 14 April 2004, Kind stepped up in distance for a seven-furlong maiden at Newmarket. This time she got away from the start well and led the group that was racing on the far side of the course. She was overtaken near the finish and finished third, with the race being won by the filly Relaxed. On 22 May, Kind returned to Kempton Park, where racing against colts for the first time, she started as the odds-on favourite. She took the lead and went clear, with the other horses being unable to challenge her. Kind won the race by six lengths from Farewell Gift. Eleven days later she won again at Kempton, this time beating Swinbrook by a head over six furlongs. Racing at Kempton Park for the fourth time in her career on 23 June, Kind recorded her third successive victory. This was in the Williamhillradio.com Classified Stakes, where after tracking the leaders in the early stages, she took the lead with one furlong still to run and won by half a length from Celtic Thunder.
In July Kind raced in her first Handicap, the Vibe FM Fillies' Rates Stakes at Newmarket. As with her previous race, she followed the front runners and took the lead one furlong out, this time winning by a short-head from Valjarv. In her final race as a three-year-old, she stepped up in class for the Listed Flower of Scotland Stakes at Hamilton. The pre-race favourite was Enchantment, who had finished fourth in her two previous runs in Listed races. Kind was priced at 8/1. Ridden by regular jockey Richard Hughes, she raced near the front of the field of eleven, just behind the leaders, in the early stages and took the lead inside the final furlong. She won the race by half a length from Autumn Pearl, with Frascati a further three quarters of a length behind in third place.
2005: Five-year-old season.
Kind started the 2005 season in the Landsdown Fillies' Stakes at Bath, where she finished third behind winner Indian Maiden. In May, Kind contested the Kilvington Stakes at Nottingham, where she started at the price of 3/1. She took the lead with over one furlong left to run and held on to win by half a length from Forever Phoenix, with pre-race favourite Ringmoor Down a further three quarters of a length back in third place. On 1 June, Kind started in her first Group race, the six-furlong Ballyogan Stakes. She started the race as favourite and Richard Hughes placed her in about third place in the early stages of the race. She took the lead of the race in the penultimate furlong, but was overtaken by La Cucaracha before the field entered the final furlong. Kind finished the race in third place, less than one length behind winner La Cucaracha. In the Summer Stakes Kind raced near the rear of the field and could not challenge the leaders, finishing in fifth place, with the race being won by Lucky Spin. Kind's final race start came in the Phoenix Sprint Stakes, when she finished fifth again. Throughout her racing career she earned £72,402 in prize money.
Stud career.
Kind was retired to Juddmonte Farms stud and has become a successful broodmare. Her first three foals have won Group races and all of her first five foals have won at least two races. Her foals are:

SheffieldLive!, also known as SheffieldLive! 93.2FM, is a community radio station established in 2003 as an independent company by the Community Media Association and is based in the city centre of Sheffield, England.
History.
SheffieldLive! started operating a live streaming service on an annual Restricted Service Licence in 2000 and from 2002 was broadcasting regularly for four days a week on the Internet.
Station owner Commedia Sheffield first applied for a Community Broadcasting Licence in November 2004 in order to bring original and modern programming to Sheffield soon after the introduction of the Community Broadcasting Licence by Ofcom in the UK (not to be confused with Independent Local Radio which is a commercial radio broadcast service).
The service started broadcasting on the frequency 93.2 FM on 29 October 2007 with the studio based at 6 Paternoster Row, Sheffield in the former National Centre for Popular Music. Prior to this, the last time a new radio service launched in Sheffield was Hallam FM in October 1974. The station was launched to provide original programming by local people of all ages, backgrounds and abilities and was originally planned to broadcast for a minimum term of five years dependent on its success in the community.
Full-time over the air broadcasting started at 7 am with "The Breakfast Show" presented by Lloyd Samuels, featuring interviews with Nick Clegg MP, local choral group Sosa Xa! and organisers of the three-day Dignity Not Detention march from Sheffield to Doncaster that took place on the same weekend.
SheffieldLive! uses a transmitter at Crosspool shared by other local radio stations provided by Bauer Radio and the BBC, allowing coverage as far as Rotherham to the east and Barnsley to the north.
The station currently broadcasts from studios located at 15 Paternoster Row in central Sheffield above the Showroom Cinema accommodated in offices and training suites owned by Commedia Sheffield.
Projects and activities.
SheffieldLive! has been involved with many projects in the local community:
Relocation.
In 2009, the station relocated from the Hallam University owned buildings to a private office across the road at The Workstation above the Showroom Cinema.

Embassy of the People's Republic of China, London

The Embassy of China in London is the diplomatic mission of the People's Republic of China in the United Kingdom. The Embassy in London is the PRC's only embassy in the UK, alongside two Consulate-Generals in Edinburgh and Manchester. It is the focal point for events relating to the PRC held in the United Kingdom including celebrations in 2012 to commemorate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Most applications by UK citizens for visas to China are not handled by the embassy, however, but are instead processed by the nearby China Visa Applications Center. There is a constant police presence outside the embassy.
China also maintains several other buildings in London: a Defence Section at 25 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead, a Commercial Section at 16 Lancaster Gate, Paddington, a Cultural Section at 11 West Heath Road, Hampstead and a Science & Technology Section at 10 Greville Place, Maida Vale.
The Embassy has in recent years been the site of protests against actions of the government of the PRC, including protests against the imprisonment of artist Ai Weiwei, and in favour of Tibetan independence. There has been a Falun Gong protestor sitting opposite the embassy for many years; this is made reference to in the novel "Saturday" by Ian McEwan.
Unconfirmed rumours have suggested that the Embassy is likely to move from Portland Place to a new development in the Nine Elms area on the south bank of the River Thames, where the Dutch Embassy and the Embassy of the United States are due to relocate. 
Controversy.
On the 3rd of June 2014, members of staff at the Chinese embassy in London reacted angrily when people arrived to lay flowers to mark the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Wang Ti-Anna, the daughter of an imprisoned democracy activist and another women were shoved, their flowers thrown away, and they were shouted at by a member of staff, before calm returned to the scene.

Equestrian statue of George IV, Trafalgar Square

The statue of George IV in Trafalgar Square, London, is a bronze equestrian statue by Sir Francis Legatt Chantrey. It depicts the King dressed in ancient Roman attire and riding bareback. The sculpture was originally designed to sit on top of the Marble Arch at the entrance to Buckingham Palace, but was placed in its current location following the King's death.
History.
Sir Francis Leggatt Chantrey originally designed the statue to stand on top of Marble Arch in its original position as the entrance to Buckingham Palace, following architecture work by John Nash. Edward Blore took over the work, and his redesign to reduce costs removed the Chantrey statue. Chantrey's work was funded by George IV himself, rather than by public subscription. The statue was cast in 1828.
George IV died in 1830, and the statue was placed on an empty plinth in Trafalgar Square in December 1843, which was expected to be on a temporary basis, however it has remained there ever since. It was unveiled to little ceremony, with "The Times" describing it as "somewhat suddenly erected". It was the first statue erected on one of the pedestals, which were installed three years earlier with architect Charles Barry expecting them to be filled by groups of statues. An inscription was added towards the end of the 19th century as the public were no longer aware of whom it was a statue.
Journalist Janice Turner questioned the need for a George IV statue in Trafalgar Square in 2005, which was rebutted by Lord Baker of Dorking who argued that the monarch still deserved the statue due to his town planning legacy which remained in London. In 2012, milliner Stephen Jones created a crown to add to the statue, both for George IV and for his horse. It was part of the "Hatwalk" art project in conjunction with the Mayor of London, which saw 21 millerners create new hats for various famous statues around London.

Solomon Gai (1600 – August, 1638) was an Italian scholar and hebraist. He was born and died in Mantua.
Gai is chiefly known as the correspondent and friend of Johannes Buxtorf II. In a letter which he wrote to Buxtorf from Mantua on November 6, 1637, Gai declared that he had emigrated to Botzen, a town in the South Tyrol, where he had become the tutor of the two sons of a rich man named Jacob Moravia. He studied German at Botzen, and after a stay of five years and a half returned to Mantua.
Buxtorf's Latin translation of the "Moreh" won Gai's admiration. Attributing the translation to Buxtorf the Elder, Gai wrote a letter expressing admiration for the father. Buxtorf explained to Gai that he himself was the translator, and sent him a copy of his dissertation "Diatribe" as a present. Gai wrote another letter to Buxtorf in Latin with a Hebrew introduction drawing his attention to works of which Buxtorf was unaware. Buxtorf subsequently commissioned Gai to purchase Hebrew books for him. Gai insisted particularly on obtaining Buxtorf's lexicons, as he planned to write a lexicon in collaboration with a cleric to whom he was giving Hebrew lessons.

The Block 1 version of SLS used on this mission will consist of two five-segment Solid Rocket Boosters, four RS-25D engines built for the Space Shuttle program and an Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. EM-1 is intended to demonstrate the integrated spacecraft systems prior to a crewed flight and demonstrate a high speed reentry (11 km/s) on Orion's thermal protection system.
On January 16, 2013, NASA announced that the European Space Agency would build Orion's service module based on its Automated Transfer Vehicle, so the flight could also be regarded as a test of ESA hardware as well as American.
Predecessors.
Apollo 8 - had a similar flight path and was also a mission designed to flight test a Command Service Module beyond Earth orbit, it was crewed by 3 astronauts and was lifted by the Saturn V vehicle in 1968.
Apollo 13 - also flew a similar flight path after sustaining damage in an explosion. The spacecraft remained on a free return trajectory as it passed the moon, and as a result it holds the current absolute altitude record for a manned spacecraft. The mission's commander, Jim Lovell, holds the distinction of having set this record twice, the first time on Apollo 8.
