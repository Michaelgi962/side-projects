Shakaar

"Shakaar" is the 70th episode of the science fiction television series "", the 24th episode of the third season.
Plot.
When the First Minister of the Bajoran Provisional Government dies, Kai Winn is appointed to his duties on an interim basis and is positioned to be formally elected to the office. Later, Winn approaches Major Kira with a special request. A group of farmers in Kira's home province refuse to return some soil reclamators that Winn needs for Bajor's recovery efforts in Rakantha Province. Their leader, Shakaar, also led Kira's resistance cell during the Occupation, so Winn wants Kira to convince him to return the property. Kira is reluctant to confront her friend and mentor, but agrees to do it for the good of Bajor.
Kira visits Shakaar, who calmly tells his side of the story: he only received the reclamators two months before, after a three-year wait, and was told that he and fellow farmers (and former resistance cell compatriots) Furel and Lupaza would have their use for a year. But when Winn took over, they were ordered to return them immediately. Since the Rakantha project is geared toward farming products for export, while Shakaar's farmers are trying to feed their people, he sees his project as far more important. Kira encourages him to meet with Winn, hoping they can compromise.
Kira tells Winn that she has arranged a meeting, to which Winn agrees. Later, as Kira briefs Shakaar for the discussion, two security officers arrive to arrest him. Infuriated that Winn lied, Kira helps subdue the officers and escapes with Shakaar.
Now fugitives, Shakaar, Kira, and their comrades hide in the mountains where they once eluded the Cardassians. Weeks later, as Bajoran troops close in, Shakaar's exhausted group realizes there is no option but to stop running and fight. Reluctantly, he and Kira lead their pursuers into a canyon to set up an ambush.
Hiding in the canyon, Shakaar and Kira watch as the Bajoran troops enter their trap. But as they see the faces of their "enemies", the realization hits that they will be shooting former comrades-in-arms. Unwilling to do this, Kira and Shakaar drop their weapons and, after a brief conversation with the leader, Colonel Lenaris, a cease-fire is called. Later, Lenaris takes Kira and Shakaar to Winn's office, where Shakaar informs her that he has decided to enter the election for First Minister. Realizing a competitive election with the popular Shakaar will expose how Winn's actions brought Bajor to the brink of civil war, Winn decides to step down from the race.

Fifth Avenue High School

Fifth Avenue High School is a defunct school located at 1800 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Bluff neighborhood, USA.
Built in 1894 as a large Romanesque/Gothic Revival building, it served the Pittsburgh Public Schools until its closure in 1976. For over thirty years the building sat empty, boarded up, and fenced off until it was eventually converted into other uses.
Fifth Avenue was the first fireproof school in Pennsylvania and was home to the Alpha Chapter of the National Honor Society. Its colors were red and white, and the mascot was the Archer, so chosen because of the school's architecture and hallways filled with Gothic and Victorian arches lined with red and white tile.
Fifth Avenue was a dominant force in city sports, winning the state title in its last year open for basketball. The school served the Lower Hill District, while its main rival, Schenley High School, served the upper and middle Hill.
The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 and was listed as a Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation landmark in 1998 and a City of Pittsburgh landmark in 1999.
Beginning in 2009, it was converted into loft apartments by a Pittsburgh-based investor group. Construction on the project was completed in 2012. Numerous components of the structure, such as plaster ceilings in common areas, were saved, preserved, or reused in the renovations.
Among the school's notable alumni are former Mayor of Pittsburgh Sophie Masloff and forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht, who served as Coroner (later Medical Examiner) and a Commissioner of Allegheny County.

Bluegrass Brewing Company

Bluegrass Brewing Company is a brewery and a chain of brewpubs based in Louisville, Kentucky, USA.
History.
The company was founded as a brewpub in Louisville, Kentucky in 1993 by chief brewer David Pierce and a small group of beer investors. In the late 90's Pipkin Brewing Co began contract brewing and bottling BBC beers. In 2001 the BBC purchased the Pipkin Brewing Company located at 636 East Main St Louisville, KY while the brewpub continued to operate at 3929 Shelbyville Rd, both are still operating in those locations today. In 2001 the brewpub and brewery split into two separate companies with a mutual name due to irreconcilable differences between owners. The Main St brewery now packages and distributes regionally, and the brewpub packages 750ml bottles for distribution, but for the most part produces beer for the pub and a non-brewing satellite location located at 660 4th st in Louisville. The Main St location is the home of the Louisville Beer Museum and Taproom which does not offer food. Award winning brewer Jerry Gnagy is the head brewer for the brewpub. Joel Halbleib and Matt Gould are the brewers for the Main St location. David Pierce departed the BBC in April of 09' to brew for the New Albanian Brewing Co.
Awards.
The brewery regularly competes in the Great American Beer Festival and its beers have won a number of awards, including multiple gold medals for the Bearded Pat's Barleywine, a gold medal in 2003 for its smoked beer "Black Silk" and a bronze medal, also in 2003, for its Dortmunder-style lager beer. and most recently in 2008 for Kick in the Baltic Porter.

Calocybe gambosa

Calocybe gambosa, commonly known as St. George's mushroom, is an edible mushroom that grows mainly in fields, grass verges and roadsides. Deriving its common name from when it first appears in the UK, namely on St George's Day (23 April). It appears in March in Italy, a warmer country, and is there known as "marzolino", where it is very popular to eat. It is also very popular in Northern Spain and Southern France, in the Basque Country region and its surroundings where it is called "perretxiko" and appears in April. In these regions it is usually eaten sautéed with egg or with bacon.
It is considered a delicacy, especially when fried in butter. It was previously considered a part of the large genus "Tricholoma" and is still seen as "T. gambosum" in older texts.
Taxonomy.
Initially described as "Agaricus gambosus" by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, with its specific epithet derived from a Latin term for club footed in relation to its bulky stem. It was later named "Tricholoma gambosum" before being reclassified as "Calocybe gambosa". In Germany it is known as "Maipilz", where it fruits in May. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek terms "kalos" "pretty", and "cubos" "head". In Denmark it's called "Vårmousseron", appearing in spring - early may 
Description.
The cap measures from 5–15 cm in diameter and has a smooth texture and has ridges on it. The cap, stem and flesh can be from white-creamy coloured to bright yellow. The sinuate gills are white and crowded. The flesh is thick and soft and has a mealy or cucumber smell. The spore print is white to pinkish white. The stubby stem is bulky at the base.
Care must be taken not to confuse it with the highly poisonous "Inocybe erubescens", which grows in the same habitats. The latter has a more pungent fruity smell and bruises red. "Entoloma sinuatum", also poisonous, has a rancid smell.
Distribution and habitat.
It is common in grasslands in Europe, often in areas rich in limestone. It is common on the Swedish islands Öland and Gotland, both situated in the Baltic sea. On the South Downs in southern England, it has formed huge fairy rings which appear to be several hundred years old. It is found from April in the United Kingdom, and earlier in warmer countries.
Edibility.
The mushroom is best picked in dry weather. It can be eaten dry, pickled or even raw. It is imported in commercial quantities into Western Europe from Romania.

Shih-poo

The Shih-poo is a small domestic dog. It is a crossbreed between a Poodle and a Shih Tzu. The name "Shih-poo" is a portmanteau of the two breed names.
Legitimate breed associations such as the AKC, the UKC, and the CKC, do not recognize the Shih-poo, or any other designer cross, as a breed in its own right. However, some major kennel clubs do accept registration of crossbreed and mixed-breed dogs for performance events such as agility and obedience.
Appearance.
The Shih-poo is one of many named Poodle crossbreeds, bred in an attempt to combine the characteristics of the Poodle, such as its high intelligence and low-shed coat, with the desirable traits of another breed—in this case, the Shih Tzu. However, it is equally likely that undesirable traits from the parents will be produced as well, so puppies must be carefully selected. Some Shih-poos may have a longer, more Poodle-like muzzle than their Shih-Tzu parent, alleviating many breathing problems that Shih-Tzus can experience, such as Brachycephalic syndrome.
Size.
The size varies, and depends on whether the Poodle parent is of the teacup, miniature, or standard breed. Typically, a shih-tzu and a miniature poodle are chosen for the parents, which results in average adult weights of 10–15 pounds. A shih-tzu and standard Poodle mix is extremely uncommon.
Color.
Shih-poos come in a wide variety of colors, such as all black, all white, cream, sable, and any mix and combination thereof.

Duplicate Boy

Duplicate Boy (Ord Quelu of the planet Lallor) is a fictional superhero in the first appearing in a story by science fiction writer Edmond Hamilton in "Adventure Comics" #324 (September 1964). Hamilton had created a backstory for Duplicate Boy, who was first submitted as a super hero concept to DC comics by a young fan, Thea Temple, in 1963, who received acknowledgment from the company. Duplicate Boy appeared as a supporting character in the Legion of Super-Heroes titles, set approximately a thousand years in the future, and is one of the most powerful beings in that time-frame.
Fictional character biography.
Duplicate Boy is a member of the Heroes of Lallor, which operates in the 30th Century, along with the Legion of Super-Heroes with whom he has teamed up on occasion. He was romantically involved with Legionnaire Shrinking Violet for many years. When she is kidnapped and replaced by Yera, a Durlan impostor who starts a romantic relationship with Colossal Boy, he travels to Earth to confront him. Busy fighting Colossal Boy, he is knocked unconscious by another Legionnaire, Ultra Boy. Recovering, he then confronts Violet, and realises that she is an imposter, but doesn't mention this to anyone else. When Violet is freed from captivity some time later, she dumps him for this act.
Duplicate Boy has not appeared in any post-Crisis stories
Powers and abilities.
Duplicate Boy can duplicate any superpower he has ever encountered, and is able to duplicate more than one at a time as well. Thus, he is potentially more powerful than every other superhero in the 30th century, including each member of the Legion of Super-Heroes. 
His main limitation was his intelligence, as he often would "forget to be invulnerable". For whatever reason he was never depicted as trying to duplicate intelligence powers (e.g., Brainiac 5) that might help him deduce what powers would be most effective, instead usually relying on Evolvo Lad's strategems or none at all. He once tried to take on Validus by duplicating the "Validus Power", which caused him to fall unconscious.

Steve Pajcic

Steve Pajcic (born August 4, 1946) was the Democratic nominee for governor of Florida in 1986. A former state legislator, Pajcic now practices law in his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida.
Upbringing and education.
Pajcic was born and raised in Northwest Jacksonville and is of Croatian descent. He attended Annie R. Morgan Elementary School, Paxon Middle School, and Paxon High School. At Paxon High, he was valedictorian and student body class president. Pajcic then attended Princeton, where he played on the basketball team with future NBA player and Democratic presidential candidate, Bill Bradley. After graduating "magna cum laude" from Princeton, Pajcic attended Harvard Law School, graduating with honors.
Political career.
In 1974, Pajcic was elected to the first of six terms to the Florida House of Representatives, where he showed particular interest in educational issues. In 1986 he ran for the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida. In the primary election Pajcic slightly led the second-place finisher, state Attorney General Jim Smith; but, as neither had received 50%, per Florida law, a runoff primary was held. During the brief campaign before the run-off, Smith's rhetoric was seen by many as unprecedented in its vitriol for an intraparty contest. In a televised debate, the candidates were asked if, should they fail to win the nomination, would they endorse their runoff opponent in the general election against the Republican nominee. Both Smith and Pajcic answered in the affirmative. However, when Pajcic emerged victorious, Smith evaded the issue of an endorsement for several days. Eventually, Smith came out and openly endorsed the Republican candidate, Tampa mayor Bob Martinez. This split in Democratic ranks was a major contributor to the election of Martinez as only the second Republican governor in Florida history, as even Martinez himself acknowledged in later years.
Pajcic ended his electoral career after the 1986 election, and reentered private practice in his home town of Jacksonville. However, he has remained politically active behind the scenes over the past twenty years. Pacjic's greatest influence was felt during the campaign of Nat Glover. In 1995, Pajcic and his brother, Gary Pajcic (1947–2006), managed Glover's ultimately successful campaign to become Jacksonville's first African-American sheriff. Pajcic and Pajcic, the law firm owned by Pajcic and his brother, was also a major financial contributor to Bill Bradley's 2000 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Pajcic himself was a member of Bradley's advisory board.
Interestingly, Pajcic's law firm donated $7500 to the successful 2006 gubernatorial campaign of Republican Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist.
Continued work in education.
Besides working as an attorney, Pajcic has remained an active proponent of education as a private citizen. In 1992, Pajcic and his brother Gary established a million dollar endowment at the University of North Florida to pay the full tuition of "any" graduate of their alma mater, Paxon High School, who was accepted at and enrolled at UNF. Pajcic has also set up an endowment to pay the tuition of Paxon students who enroll at his college alma mater, Princeton University. And in 2002, Pajcic and his brother donated another $1 million to boost education at five inner-city elementary schools in Jacksonville, including Annie R. Morgan, where both brothers attended elementary school. On February 10, 2014, Steve and his wife, Anne, donated $2 million dollars to Edward Waters College in Jacksonville. It is the largest amount the historically black college has ever received in a single donation. Pajcic said it is a blessing to be able to help others. Former Sheriff Nat Glover graduated from EWC and is now the President of the school.

Never Ever Let You Go

"Never Ever Let You Go" was the Danish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001, performed in English by Rollo & King.
The song was performed in Danish at the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix in 2001, titled "Der står et billede af dig på mit bord" ("There is a picture of you on my table").
The song was performed twenty-third (last) on the night, following Greece's Antique with "Die For You". At the close of voting, it had received 177 points, placing 2nd in a field of 23.
The song is from the perspective of a man who has lost his lover. He pleads with her to return and promises that he will "never ever let you go".
For much of the night, the song led the voting and gave Denmark high hopes of achieving the rare feat of winning the Contest in successive years (it eventually finished 21 points behind the Estonian winners, Tanel Padar and Dave Benton with "Everybody").
It was succeeded as Danish representative at the 2002 Contest by Malene with "Tell Me Who You Are".

<doc id="5901494" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5901494" title="Nālaṭiyār">
Nālaṭiyār

The Nālaṭiyār () is a Tamil poetic work of didactic nature belonging to the "Patiṉeṇkīḻkaṇakku" anthology of Tamil literature. This belongs to the post Sangam period corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. "Nālaṭiyār" contains 400 poems, each containing four lines. Every poem deals with morals and ethics, extolling righteous behaviour. 
There is an old Tamil proverb praising the "Nālaṭiyār" that says ""Nālaṭiyār" and the "Tirukkuṛaḷ" are very good in expressing human thoughts just as the twigs of the banyan and the acacia trees are good in maintaining the teeth.".
Didactic nature.
"Nālaṭiyār" was composed by Jain monks, who flourished in what is now Tamil Nadu during the reign of the Kalabhras dynasty and delivers the didactic messages that are characteristics of the period. It is divided into three sections, the first section focusing on the importance of virtuous life, second section on the governance and management of wealth, and the third smaller section on the pleasures.
"Nālaṭiyār" is unique in the employment of similes, which help to teach the moral codes using simple examples from daily life. For example, one of the poems states that just like a calf placed in front of a vast herd of cows seeks out its mother unerringly and attaches itself, the deeds of the past home in on the doer and exact their price unfailingly.

Credible minimum deterrence

Credible Minimum Deterrence is the principle on which Pakistan and India's nuclear doctrine are based.
It underlines no first use (NFU) with a second strike capability, and falls under minimal deterrence as opposed to mutually assured destruction. India's tentative nuclear doctrinewas announced on August 17, 1999 by the then secretary of the National Security Advisory Board, Brajesh Mishra.
Later this draft was adopted with some modifications when the Nuclear Command Authority was announced on January 4, 2003. A significant modification was the dilution of the NFU principle to include nuclear retaliation to attacks by biological and chemical weapons.
Indian National Security Advisor Shri Shivshankar Menon further signaled a significant shift from "no first use" to "no first use against non-nuclear weapon states" in a speech on the occasion of Golden Jubilee celebrations of National Defence College in New Delhi on October 21, 2010, a doctrine Menon said reflected India's "strategic culture, with its emphasis on minimal deterrence."

Graham Napier

Graham Richard Napier (born 6 January 1980) is an English cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler, and is capable of bowling 90+mph.
Napier has played first-class cricket for his home county of Essex since the outset of his senior career in 1997. Between 1997 and 1999 Napier played in four Youth Test matches in England against Zimbabwe, South Africa (twice) and Australia's respective under-19 teams. He was also a member of the 1998 U-19 Cricket World Cup-winning squad. Napier was on the books of Ipswich Town as a goalkeeper and played for a season on loan at Felixstowe Town.
Playing style.
Born in Colchester, Essex, Napier is a fast-medium bowler, whose stock delivery reaches between 85 mph-90 mph. Napier has displayed a slower ball in Twenty20 games which has proved hard to spot. As a batsman, Napier can be among the most deadly not only in domestic cricket but in world cricket also. He has twice hit 16 sixes in an innings, once in a Twenty20 match, and once in a County Championship match. His fielding has been known to be slightly below par, but it can be put down to the fact that Napier is very injury prone and he cannot afford to throw himself around.
Twenty20 and 40 over.
Napier participated in the 2003, 2004 and 2006 Twenty20 Cups, in which he aided his Essex team to the 2004 quarter-finals.
In a Twenty20 cup match against Sussex on 24 June 2008, Napier scored 152 not out from 58 balls. The innings set a number of records, notably the highest individual score in a T20 innings in England, and in the domestic Twenty20 competition; the highest number of sixes in an individual Twenty20 innings (16); the most runs scored in boundaries in an individual Twenty20 innings (136 runs, scored as 10 fours, and 16 sixes). It also broke the record for most sixes in a domestic one-day innings, and tied the record for most sixes in any domestic innings, tying the record set by Andrew Symonds, during a County Championship game in 1995.
He was signed by the Mumbai Indians for the 2009 IPL Season for an undisclosed amount.
In March 2009, Napier was called up to the England Lions squad for the first time since 2004. Geoff Miller, one of the selectors, said "the selectors felt this was a good opportunity for us to have a closer look at him within the England set-up".
On 1 May 2009, Napier was confirmed as a member of the 15-man England squad for the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup on the same day as he made his first appearance for the Mumbai Indians.
On 3 June 2013, Napier finished a YB40 match with figures of 7 wickets for 32 runs, including 3 maidens, taking 4 wickets in 4 balls as Essex beat Surrey by 178 runs.
First class.
On 19 May 2011, Napier equalled the record for most sixes scored in a first-class innings. He hit 16 sixes as part of a 130-ball 196 for Essex. It was his first first class innings for 11 months, after being sidelined with a back injury. He hit 103 runs from the last 29 balls of his innings. After his innings, Napier told BBC Essex that he considers himself as mainly a bowler. On 22 June 2013, Napier took career best bowling figures of 7 wickets for 90 runs against Leicestershire.

Nickel(II) nitrate

Nickel nitrate is the chemical compound Ni(NO3)2 or any hydrate thereof. The anhydrous form is not commonly encountered, thus "nickel nitrate" usually refers to nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate. The formula for this species is written in two ways. Ni(NO3)2.6H2O and, more descriptively [Ni(H2O)6](NO3)2. The latter formula indicates that the nickel(II) center is surrounded by six water molecules in this hydrated salt. The nitrate anions are not bonded to nickel.
Safety.
Like other nitrates, nickel nitrate is oxidizing, so that caution should be exercised when it contacts with reducing materials such as organic substances. It is also irritating to the eyes, skin and, upon inhalation of the dust, respiratory tract. It may cause skin allergy. Nickel nitrate is a carcinogen, along with most other nickel compounds. The nickel ion is also toxic to aquatic organisms.

Pop! was an Australian band of the 1990s. It was a side project of Melbourne band About Six Feet. Together with Frente's Angie Hart they recorded the song Tingly, which was released as a single in 1995, and reached the Triple J Hottest 100 of the same year. About Six Feet consisted of Tony Stott and John Richards, and although they wrote Tingly together, Pop! was very much Stott's project.

John Henry Nicholson

John Henry Nicholson (12 June 1838 - 30 June 1923) was an Australian teacher and writer.
Nicholson was the son of John Nicholson, an oriental scholar of distinction, and the first English friend of Ludwig Leichhardt Nicholson was born at Lyme Regis, Dorset, England, was educated at Croft House academy, and emigrated to New South Wales in 1854. He went to Queensland in 1859, opened a private school at Toowoomba in 1860, and in 1863 had a school at Warwick. He joined the Queensland education department in May 1865 as an assistant teacher. He resigned in 1868 in order to visit England, rejoined the department in June 1869, and later had charge of several country state schools. 
Between 1867 and in 1878 he published three little books of miscellaneous prose and verse, facetious and satirical in character and not of much merit. So far back as 1856, however, he had begun to brood over the idea of writing an allegorical history of a man's life on the earth, and in 1873 he wrote the early chapters of "The Adventures of Halek", which was published in London in 1882. He resigned from the education department in April 1885 but rejoined some years later and was head teacher of the state school at Cambooya from September 1893 to the end of 1894 when he finally gave up teaching. He was then appointed registrar of births, marriages and deaths at Nundah near Brisbane. A second edition of Halek was published in 1896 at Brisbane, and a third appeared in 1904. In the same year "Almoni", described as a companion volume to Halek, was also published at Brisbane. 
When Nicholson was approaching 70 years of age a Swedish literary woman, who had been attracted by his work, came to Australia from California and married him. In his later years Nicholson, who had always been inclined to be erratic, would sometimes voluntarily go to the mental hospital at Goodna until he felt fit to face the world again. He died at Brisbane on 30 June 1923 at the age of 85. His wife survived him. There were no children.

Abram Chayes

Abram Chayes (July 18, 1922 – April 16, 2000) was an American scholar of international law closely associated with the administration of John F. Kennedy. He is best known for his “legal process” approach to international law, which attempted to provide a new, less formalistic way of understanding international law and how it might further develop. By focusing on how international legal rules are actually used by foreign policy decision-makers, Chayes sought to study international law, not within a vacuum of legal rules and procedures, but in a dynamic political environment.
Early life and education.
Abram Chayes's full name was Abram Joseph Chayes, but he did not use his middle name. He was born in Chicago. Both his parents were lawyers.
He graduated "summa cum laude" from Harvard College in 1943 and served in the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1945 as a field artillery officer in France, Holland, Germany, and Japan, leaving the service with the rank of captain. He received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
Chayes graduated first in his class from Harvard Law School in 1949, where he served as president of the "Harvard Law Review".
Legal, academic, and governmental career.
After law school, Chayes was Legal Advisor to Governor Chester Bowles of Connecticut from 1949 to 1951, and then served in Washington, D.C., as Associate General Counsel of the President's Materials Policy Commission in 1951. He clerked for Justice Felix Frankfurter of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1951 to 1952, and practiced law privately with Covington & Burling in Washington, D.C., from 1952 to 1955.
In 1955 he joined the faculty at Harvard Law School as an associate professor and began teaching courses in constitutional law and international law.
In the late 1950s, Chayes was among the original members of a group of Harvard faculty members who worked on the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. He led the team that drafted the 1960 Democratic Convention platform, and was one of Kennedy's principal issues advisers during the campaign.
When Kennedy was elected, he worked as Legal Adviser to the State Department. Chayes played an important role in a number of major crises, including the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. He also worked on the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 banning atmospheric nuclear tests.
In 1964, Chayes worked at the law firm of Ginsburg & Feldman in Washington, D.C., before returning to Harvard Law School in 1965, where in 1976 he became the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law. Chayes developed a new international law course at Harvard and co-authored a widely used book, "International Legal Process".
He also taught civil procedure and authored a widely cited article in the "Harvard Law Review" on the legal remedies and the difficulty of dealing with domestic social issues legally. He became professor emeritus in 1993, but continued to teach until incapacitated by complications from pancreatic cancer.
After leaving the Kennedy administration, Chayes remained politically active. He worked on the 1968 presidential campaign of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, wrote articles on nuclear arms control, co-authored a book with Jerome Wiesner, President Kennedy's Science Adviser, on Anti-Ballistic Missiles and strategic policy, and advised Democratic members of the Senate in the debate in the early 1970s over ABM deployment (he was a strong supporter of the ABM Treaty of 1972). In 1972, Chayes advised the presidential campaign of George McGovern on foreign policy matters, and in 1976 was a foreign policy adviser to the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter.
In the 1980s, Chayes argued on behalf of the Government of Nicaragua against the United States in the seminal International Court of Justice (ICJ) case "Nicaragua v. United States". The ICJ ruled that the U.S. was guilty of "unlawful use of force" when it mined Nicaragua's harbors. Chayes also wrote articles arguing that the Reagan Administration was barred from testing and deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or "Star Wars" under the 1972 ABM Treaty.
Publications.
Before returning to Harvard Law, Chayes received a grant from the Carnegie Corporation to publish "The Cuban Missile Crisis". In this publication, Chayes illuminated the interrelations of law and foreign policy decisions that created what many call the finest hour of Kennedy’s Administration. In doing so, he reinforced the notion that “law is not a set of fixed, self-defining categories of permissible and prohibited conduct” but instead is a dynamic set of normative rules that can guide foreign policy decision-makers.
In his book, Chayes focused his analysis on three major decisions: 1) the choice of the quarantine, as opposed to harsher or milder responses, 2) the decision to seek an O.A.S. authorizing resolution, and 3) the manner and method of the approach to the U.N. analysis of the situation. In doing so, he highlighted the principle ways in which international law affected the course of action adopted:
first, as a constraint, then as a basis of justification or legitimation of action, and third as providing organizational structures, procedures and forums.
Because the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba did not constitute an armed attack on the United States, warranting a more aggressive unilateral response, the Kennedy Administration imposed a naval quarantine on Cuba. This more restrictive response only blocked offensive military equipment from being imported. A classic blockade, on the other hand, restricts all imports, including food supplies, and is considered an act of war.
Although the Soviet Union initially responded to the proposed quarantine by accusing the U.S. of “piratical acts” and “unheard of breaches of international law,” Washington lawyers took comfort in NATO support and a unanimous O.A.S. action authorizing the naval quarantine. By gaining the approval of the O.A.S. and using the unique forum of the United Nations for the crystallizing and mobilizing of national government views, the U.S. gained support and neutralized opposition during the crisis. In sum, Chayes noted the importance of the U.S. government’s willingness to accept the obligation of international legal justification, and therefore, public accountability, during the successful mitigation of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In doing so, the role of international law in decision-making advanced.
In 1968, Chayes, along with Thomas Ehrlich and Andreas Lowenfeld, formally introduced a new approach to the study of international law by publishing a two-volume textbook entitled: International Legal Process: Materials for an Introductory Course. The textbook focuses on three issue areas: 1) the limits of adjudication, 2) economic affairs, and 3) political problems, in order to provide a general introduction into the scope, adequacies and failures of an international legal system operating in a contemporary and complex international arena with new political actors, including a proliferation of international organizations. Each issue area contains problems that Chayes hoped would ignite classroom discussion and critical analysis, since, as he pointed out, most of these problems do not arise before courts or arbitral tribunals, but are debated by parties, under pressure from a variety of sources including NGOs and domestic lobbyists, during the policy decision-making process. Philip Heymann once said: “For Abe, problems were there to give joy to the people who tackled them.” 
Most recently, in his book The New Sovereignty: Compliance with International Regulatory Agreements, Chayes and Antonia Handler Chayes, his wife and co-author, sought to understand what states, international organizations, officials, and other actors do when they implement, or try to implement, regulatory treaties. These collaborative efforts, taking place within a complex web of norms, rules, and practices, attempt to raise levels of party compliance to acceptable levels. Although treaties are sometimes equipped with sanctioning provisions, “teeth” to enforce treaty compliance, Chayes argued that these coercive economic sanctions reflect an easy but incorrect analogy to domestic legal systems, where the coercive power of the state is thought to play an influential role in enforcing national laws. He believed economic sanctions are costly, not only the state that is believed to be defying its treaty obligations, but also on the sanctioning state. Not only are the intended results of economic sanctioning slow and not conducive to altering state behavior, but the political investment required to mobilize and maintain an economic effort in a system without any recognized hierarchy of authority is dangerously high. Alternatively, Chayes noted that unilateral enforcement is not workable because an unduly burdensome obligation would fall on this “policing state,” most likely the United States.
Before proposing an alternative framework that would replace the ineffective economic sanctioning model of compliance, Chayes discussed reasons for noncompliance. He stated that the principal source of noncompliance is not willful disobedience, but instead comes from the lack of clarity, capacity, and priority. First, in an effort to formulate rules that govern future conduct for a variety of players, treaties often result in ambiguous language that does not provide determinate answers to disputed questions of interpretation. Second, states have inherent limitations on the capacity to comply. For example, although a state might have enacted implementing legislation, it will still need to create an effective regulatory enforcement system to ensure the laws are being followed. Additionally, other limitations of scientific and technical judgments, bureaucratic capability, and fiscal resources come into play. Lastly, regulatory treaties often require significant changes in economic or social systems that, by its very nature, take time and can lead to a deceptive picture of state noncompliance. Chayes cites to examples including global efforts to protect human rights by international agreements.
As against this enforcement model, Chayes proposed an alternative managerial model of compliance, relying on a problem-solving, cooperative approach instead of a coercive one. He suggests an array of activities to ensure compliance. First, Chayes highlighted the need for transparency, including the development of data on performance through self-reporting and verification to check the reliability of reported data, both through state verification systems and, as a less formal and costly alternative, in the form of external checks from other states and nongovernmental scientific interest groups. Second, Chayes proposed informal dispute settlement measures, suggesting compulsory conciliation that would result in nonbinding recommendations. This would ensure that conciliation efforts would be able to address a broad range of disputes, while maintaining principles of sovereignty by not forcing parties to accept the decisions reached. Third, deficits in technical and bureaucratic capability and financial resources can be healed through treaty provisions that expressly provide for technical assistance to those states that are incapable of compliance due to these domestic handicaps. Fourth, Chayes combined the elements of transparency, dispute settlement, and capacity building into a broader process of “jawboning” – the effort to persuade the violator to change its ways. This can be accomplished through discourse among the parties, the treaty organization, and the international community. Chayes argued that in an international system that is increasingly interdependent, states no longer have the freedom to act independently, but instead must submit to the pressures of international regulation. He thereby cites Robert D. Putnam “The sanction for violating norms and expectations generated by this network is not penal, but exclusion from the network of solidarity and cooperation.” Throughout the book, Chayes stressed the importance of the international legal process in creating and sustaining regulatory treaties, noting how the need for improving compliance can be accomplished by cooperative problem-solving by international society.
Legacy.
In 1996 he received the Peace Advocacy Award, with his wife, Antonia Handler Chayes, from the Massachusetts chapter of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security. In 1999-2000, Professor Chayes led a team of lawyers suing Slobodan Milošević in the U.S. Courts for genocide in Kosovo, and helped investigate corruption in Bosnia. He continued to work on international environmental law, teach, and serve on the Harvard interdisciplinary group on climate change. In 1999 he received the Harvard Law School Association Award (HLSA) recognizing his service as an "inspirational teacher and distinguished scholar, advocate for the rights of sovereign nations and the protection of the global environment, beloved mentor to generations of Harvard Law students." The Law School celebrated his career with two days of panels and events concerning issues in international law on April 23–24, 1999.
Abram Chayes was heralded by many as “a wonderfully gregarious man” who, throughout his tenure at Harvard Law School, always “could be counted upon to greet the newest faculty recruits with genuine ebullience, curiosity and good-will.” His abundant good faith and zest for life spilled over into his intellectual endeavors, allowing him to truly foster a new way of thinking about the international law and the way it impacts world affairs.
Personal life.
Abram Chayes married Antonia (Toni) Handler on December 24, 1947; they had five children, including journalist Sarah Chayes. Antonia Handler Chayes served as Undersecretary of the Air Force in the Carter Administration, and is a current visiting professor of International Politics and Law at The Fletcher School, Tufts University.

13th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery

13 Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery was formed in New South Wales during September 1915 as the 13th Field Artillery Battery, part of 5th Field Artillery Brigade. Today 13 Field Battery is one of 4 batteries that make up the 1st Field Regiment, part of 7 Brigade.
History.
The entire 5th Field Brigade Australian Field Artillery was formed as part of 2nd Division Artillery at Fleurbiax, France (near Armentieres) during World War I as the requirement for artillery increased on the Western Front battlefields. The Regiment was composed of 13th, 14th, 15th and 105th Batteries. The battery saw action in Egypt, Sinai and on the Western Front, the battery was disbanded at the end of the war.
In 1921 the Citizen's Army was reconstructed based on the 1st AIF framework. As part of this, 5th Field Regiment was re-raised at Kelvin Grove, Brisbane and consisted of 13th, 14th, 105th Field Batteries. In 1938, 15th Field Battery was raised, making the Regiment the same composition as in World War I.
During the Second World War, 5th Field Regiment amalgamated to form the newly raised 2nd/5th Field Regiment. This unit was later redesignated 2nd/1st Anti Tank Regiment. At the end of World War II this unit was disbanded. In 1955, 5th Field Regiment was reformed and was equipped with 25 Pounder Guns.
In 1960, 5th Field Regiment was re-organised as part of 1st Division. 13th Field Battery and Headquarter Battery were based at Kelvin Grove. In 1964 the battery changed to 105 mm L5 Pack Howitzers and later to the 105 mm M2A2.
On 1 July 1975, 5th Field Regiment amalgamated with 11th Field Regiment to form 5th/11th Field Regiment and as a consequence of the amalgamation 13th Field Battery was taken off the Army order of battle. In 1981, 13th Field Battery was re-raised at Kallangur as part of 5th/11th Field Regiment and was equipped with 105 mm L5 Pack Howitzers. The battery has close affiliation with the Pine Rivers Shire and Local citizens and was granted the Freedom of the Shire of Pine Rivers on 22 April 1989. In 1991, as part of 5th/11th Field Regiment 13th Field Battery was equipped with the 105 mm L119 Howitzer which is currently in service. On 23 April 1993 upon the separation of 5th/11th Field Regiment, 13th Field Battery, the only Battery of 5th Field Regiment became an independent Battery. On 1 May 1997, as result of the restructuring of the Army, 13th Field Battery came under command of 1st Field Regiment. On 4 March 2001 13th Field Battery was re-located to Caboolture. 
Due to the operational requirements of 1st Field Regiment, 13th Field Battery was re-equipped with 155mm M198 Howitzers in January 2008.
Having served with the M198 Howitzers for two years, 13 Field Battery was once again equipped with the L119 Hamel and oversaw the Army's retirement of the L119. In October 2011, it was decided that 13 Battery would transfer to 9RQR and provide indirect fire support as 13 Mortar Battery, to the 9th Battalion. In 2013 the battery, after being re-equipped with 81mm mortars, amalgamated with 41 Battery and was renamed the 5/11th Light Battery. The amalgamated battery now comes under the command of 25/49 Battalion Royal Queensland Regiment and 13 Battery and 41 batteries have now been removed from the order of battle.

Christopher Slaughterford

Christopher Slaughterford of London was executed in Guildford July 9, 1709, for the murder of Jane Young, his fiancée. His case is very important, as he was the first person in modern England executed for murder based exclusively on circumstantial evidence. He is also famous for supposedly finding his fiancée's killer, one of his servants, in the form of a ghost.
Slaughterford was the last person seen in Jane Young's company on October 5, 1703. He exhibited tell-tale signs of his innocence in that he cooperated fully with all police investigations and had previously been acquitted at trial in Kingston. He had a strong alibi, yet some neighbors who did not have such strong alibis still testified to his guilt at his second trial.
The date of his execution, he wrote and signed the following statement:
"Being brought here to die, according to the sentence passed upon me at the Queen's-Bench bar, for a crime of which I am wholly innocent, I thought myself obliged to let the world know, that they may not reflect on my friends and relations, whom I have left behind me much troubled for my fatal end, that I know nothing of the death of Jane Young, nor how she came by her death, directly or indirectly, though some have been pleased to cast reflections on my aunt. However, I freely forgive all my enemies, and pray to God to give them a due sense of their errors, and in his due time to bring the truth to light. In the mean time, I beg every one to forbear reflecting on my dear mother, or any of my relations, for my unjust and unhappy fall, since what I have here set down is truth, and nothing but the truth, as I expect salvation at the hands of Almighty God; but I am heartily sorry that I should be the cause of persuading her to leave her dame, which is all that troubles me. As witness my hand this 9th day of July."
Legend.
As a ghost, he is said to appear in chains, with the cut noose around his neck, holding a staff in one hand, and a burning brand in the other, crying "Vengeance, Vengeance!" According to the legend, the guilty servant saw him and killed himself.

Hume Nisbet

James Hume Nisbet (8 August 1849 – 4 June 1923) was a Scottish-Australian author and artist.
Nisbet was born at Stirling, Scotland and received special artistic training, and was educated under the Rev. Dr. Culross (later of Bristol College) up to the age of fifteen. At 16 years of age he came to Australia and stayed about seven years, during which he travelled to Tasmania, New Zealand, and the South Sea Islands, painting and sketching and writing poetry and stories, besides making notes for future work. Of this period he spent one year acquiring theatrical experience at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, under the well-known actor Richard Stewart.
Nisbet returned to London in 1872, and spent some time in studying and copying pictures in the National Gallery and at South Kensington. At the end of the next year he went back to Scotland, and devoted himself to art, with an occasional lapse into literature. For eight years he was art master of the Watt Institution and School of Art, Edinburgh. He travelled in Australia and New Guinea again during 1886, and paid another visit to Australia in 1895. He had studied painting under Sam Bough, R.S.A., but does not appear to have had any success; in a volume called "Where Art Begins", published by him in 1892, he speaks with bitterness on the chances of success in painting.
Among his best-known paintings are "Eve's first Moonrise," "The Flying Dutchman," "The Dream of Sardanapalus," four pictures of "The Ancient Mariner," and "The Battle of Dunbar."
Nisbet devoted most of his time to writing and published many volumes of verse, books on art and fiction. Several of his novels are coloured by his Australian experiences and appear to have had some success. Miller in his "Australian Literature" lists about 40 novels published between 1888 and 1905. During the next 10 years he published a few more books including "Hathor and Other Poems", which appeared as the first volume of his poetic and dramatic works in 1905. There was another edition in 1908.
Many of Nisbet's volumes were of ghost stories. These include "Paths of the Dead" (1899), "Stories Weird and Wonderful" (1900), and "The Haunted Station" (1894) whose title story (about a haunted property or 'station' in the Australian Outback) has often been reprinted.
Nisbet was a member of the Yorick Club, London, and a friend of Philip Mennell. Nisbet died in Eastbourne, Sussex, England on 4 June 1923.

Marin Mazzie

Marin Joy Mazzie (born October 9, 1960) is an American actress and singer known for her work in musical theater. She was nominated for the Tony Award, Drama Desk Award and Olivier Award for her role as Lilli/Katharine in "Kiss Me, Kate", and won the Outer Critics Circle Award. In addition to appearing in many musical stage productions, Mazzie also performs in concert with her husband, Jason Danieley.
Early life.
Mazzie was born in Rockford, Illinois and graduated from Western Michigan University, where she received degrees in theater and music. With an early interest in the theatre, Mazzie began to perform and sing in church choir at the age of 8 and to study voice at the age of 12. She continued to act in school and at college and in summer stock, where she was an apprentice at the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan.
Career.
After graduating from college in 1982, Mazzie moved to New York City and made her New York stage debut in a 1983 Equity Library Theatre revival of the 1948 musical "Where's Charley?" as "Kitty Verdun". She appeared in the 1991 off-Broadway Kander and Ebb revue "And The World Goes 'Round" and the subsequent 10-month national tour the following year. She went on to play starring roles in over a half dozen Broadway shows and also developed a cabaret act and made appearances in television.
In 1994 Mazzie created the role of Clara in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Passion". This production was notable for its opening scene in which she was nude, in bed with co-star Jere Shea. In 1998 Mazzie was nominated for a Tony Award for the role of Mother in the original production of Lynn Ahrens and Steven Flahrety's musical, "Ragtime". She played the dual roles of Lilli Vanessi/Katharine in the 1999 revival of "Kiss Me, Kate" on Broadway, and then transferred to the West End production in 2001.
In the 2006 Encores! presentation of "Kismet" at City Center, the "Variety" reviewer wrote: "Mazzie steals the comic thunder with a delicious turn as the glamorous Slut of the Casbah (Lalume), lewdly checking out the tasty man-slaves and happily playing along with Hajj's trickery, simply because he's hot. Looking dynamite in a flashy gold Donatella-goes-Mesopotamian number and a soufflé of blond curls, Mazzie's campy delivery of "Not Since Nineveh" and the beyond-jaded "Bored" succeeds in briefly raising the temperature of the otherwise tepid brew."
In May 2008 she appeared as Guenevere opposite Gabriel Byrne as King Arthur and Nathan Gunn as Lancelot in the New York Philharmonic staged concert presentation of Lerner & Loewe's "Camelot", directed by Lonny Price. The May 8, 2008 performance of this production was broadcast nationally on "Live from Lincoln Center" on PBS.
Mazzie appeared in the drama "ENRON", opening on Broadway in April 2010, as corporate vice president Claudia Roe. She recently replaced Alice Ripley as Diana in "Next to Normal" on July 19, 2010 opposite her real-life husband Jason Danieley as Dan. They stayed with the show until the Broadway Production closed on January 16th, 2011. 
On November 20, 2009 Mazzie performed in a reading of a re-worked version of the 1988 Broadway flop "Carrie" as Margaret White. She stayed with the production which opened Off-Broadway on March 1, 2012 at the Lucille Lortel Theatre.
Mazzie is currently appearing as Helen Sinclair in the new Woody Allen/Susan Stroman musical "Bullets Over Broadway:The Musical", which opened on Broadway in April 2014.
Concerts, TV and recordings.
Mazzie has also appeared on television. In the sitcom "Still Standing", Mazzie and Kevin Nealon played an antagonistic neighbor couple in recurring roles. 
She regularly performs in cabaret and concerts. For example, she and her husband, Jason Danieley, along with Faith Prince, performed a concert as a tribute to Jerry Herman in October–November 2003 in Utah with the Utah Symphony. This was similar to the Herman tribute Mazzie performed with the Boston Pops in May 2003.
Mazzie and her husband performed at the Bay Area Cabaret (San Francisco) season on October 23, 2005, performing their "Opposite You" program. In November 2005 they released an album, "Opposite You" (P.S. Classics label), consisting of songs sung in their cabaret program.
Personal.
She is married to fellow Broadway actor Jason Danieley, whom she met in 1996 in a play that they performed together, "Trojan Women: A Love Story".

Fred Botica

Fred Botica (born 20 March 1947) was a radio announcer in Perth, Australia on Mix 94.5. He retired on 9 May 2014.
Botica was born in New Zealand, and began his radio career in December 1969 on Radio Hauraki,
to which he returned in 1973 after a couple of years working at Radio 1XX in Whakatane. In 1976, he again left Radio Hauraki to work at Melbourne's 3KZ, a stint that lasted only 6 months. Botica returning once again to Radio Hauraki as breakfast presenter and program director, where he remained (apart from a short sojourn at 1ZM) until late 1982. At this time, he started work at 89FM, the first commercial FM radio station in Auckland.
Botica immigrated to Perth from New Zealand in 1986,
and started work with Channel 7 Perth as their voiceover artist, and with 96fm as a breakfast radio announcer. During his time at 96fm, he performed the Australia Day skyshow voiceovers. In 1993, 96fm was bought by Village Roadshow and was renamed "Triple M". Staff at the station opposed the changes which were to occur with this purchase; as a consequence, Botica along with his sidekick Captain Paul shifted to 94.5 during 1992.
Since then Botica led Mix 94.5's breakfast team to the highest rating in Perth with "Botica's Bunch", although in recent years the breakfast slot has been beaten on a many occasions by ABC 720's Eoin Cameron. Botica was reputed to command an annual salary of $250,000. In 2014, just prior to his retirement, Botica moved to co-host the afternoon drive shift on Mix 94.5 with his former breakfast co-host Lisa Shaw.
Botica was notoriously camera-shy, and in all publicity and advertising for his radio show, his face was always obscured.

Albert Norton

Albert Norton (1 January 1836 – 11 March 1914) was a Queensland politician, Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly and pastoralist.
Norton was the sixth son of James Norton, born at the family home, "Elswick" now Leichhardt, New South Wales. He was educated at the Rev. F. Wilkinson's school at Sydney, and from 1852 to 1857 was gaining experience on stations in the New England district of New South Wales. During the next three years he had a wandering life in New South Wales and Victoria, but in 1860 bought the Rodd's Bay station in the Port Curtis district, Queensland. He specialised in cattle, and in spite of some bad experiences with drought and disease, became a successful pastoralist.
In 1866 he stood for the Port Curtis seat in the Legislative Assembly but was defeated, and in the following year was nominated to the Legislative Council. He resigned his seat in 1868 and did not attempt to enter politics again until in 1878, having previously retired from his station, he was elected unopposed for Port Curtis. 
In March 1883, on the resignation of John Murtagh Macrossan, Norton accepted office as Minister for Works and Mines in the first McIlwraith Ministry. In 1888 Norton was unanimously elected speaker of the legislative assembly. He lost his seat at the 1893 election, and in 1894 was nominated as a member of the legislative council. 
Norton was chairman of committee from 1902 to 1907 and continued to be an active member of the house until a few months before his death at Milton, Queensland, on 11 March 1914. Norton had been much interested in the welfare of the mining industry, he encouraged the giving of lectures in mineralogy, and was primarily responsible for the establishment of the school of mines. He was a trustee of the Royal Society of Queensland, and contributed about a dozen papers to its "Proceedings". His political speeches were always carefully prepared but the effect was to some extent spoiled by a monotonous delivery.

ACVR2A

Activin receptor type-2A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "ACVR2A" gene.
ACVR2A is an activin type 2 receptor.
Function.
This gene encodes activin A type II receptor. Activins are dimeric growth and differentiation factors which belong to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily of structurally related signaling proteins. Activins signal through a heteromeric complex of receptor serine kinases which include at least two type I (I and IB) and two type II (II and IIB) receptors. These receptors are all transmembrane proteins, composed of a ligand-binding extracellular domain with cysteine-rich region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with predicted serine/threonine specificity. Type I receptors are essential for signaling; and type II receptors are required for binding ligands and for expression of type I receptors. Type I and II receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding, resulting in phosphorylation of type I receptors by type II receptors. Type II receptors are considered to be constitutively active kinases.
Interactions.
ACVR2A has been shown to interact with:

James DeLaurier

James D. DeLaurier is an inventor and professor emeritus of the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies. He is a leader in design and analysis of lighter than air vehicles and flapping winged aircraft.
Career.
He received his bachelor of science degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and his PhD in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Stanford University. He then worked at the NASA Ames Research Center during the Apollo Program in 1965–66. In 1970 he began working with Sheldahl Corporation to develop scientific balloon designs and he designed a wing shaped balloon that would later be the inspiration for a new design of solar hybrid airships and the creation of Solar Ship Inc. where he is co-founder and CTO.
In 1974 DeLaurier established a research team at UTIAS, and was in charge of the Low-Speed Aerodynamics Laboratory. The DeLaurier lab developed wind tunnel models and flying prototypes for a new breed of airships including the Magnus Airship in the mid 1980s. His team designed flight-dynamic simulation for airships and aerostats that have been used for the certification of new commercial airships in England, the U.S. and Germany. The team, along with John Martin, designed the first successful free-flying aircraft solely powered by microwave power transmission. This project was the initiative of the Communications Research Centre, and was called SHARP (Stationary High-Altitude Relay Platform). The DeLaurier lab, along with Jeremy M. Harris, designed and built a proof-of-concept scaled ornithopter that is recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale as the world's first successful remotely piloted engine-powered flapping-wing aircraft (UTIAS Ornithopter No.1 or, more commonly, "Mr. Bill").
The team then went on to design and build an engine-powered human-carrying ornithopter, called "The Great Flapper", which took off from the ground and sustained flight on 8 July 2006. The thrust from the flapping wings was boosted by a model-aircraft jet engine.

Ain al-Hilweh

Ain al-Hilweh (variously, Ayn al-Hilweh, Ein al-Hilweh, etc.; the literal meaning is the eye of the beautiful () is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon with over 70,000 Palestinian refugees and their descendants, swelled to nearly 120,000, as a result of influx of refugees from Syria since 2011. The camp is located West of Mieh Mieh Village and Mieh Mieh Camp, Southeast of the port city of Sidon and North of Darb Es Sim village. 
Ein el-Hillweh was established near the city of Sidon in 1948 by the International Committee of the Red Cross to accommodate refugees from Amqa, Saffuriya, Sha'ab, Taitaba, Manshieh, al-Simireh, al-Nahr, Safsaf, Hittin, al-Ras al-Ahmar, al-Tira and Tarshiha in northern Palestine. The Ain Al-Hilweh Camp is located on land that is owned by landowners from Mieh Mieh village, Darb Es Sim, and Sidon. Because Lebanese Armed Forces are not allowed to enter the camp Ain al-Hilweh has been called a "zone of unlaw" by the Lebanese media. Many people wanted by the Lebanese government are believed to have taken refuge in the camp as a result of the lack of Lebanese authority.
Etymology.
The direct translation of Ain al-Hilweh is “sweet water spring”. People believe that the camp was named after a natural water spring that existed in the present day Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp. 
But the truth is, the Ain al-Hilweh spring was located at the corner of the valley between Mieh Mieh village and Darb es Seem. The water flowed from the spring westward 500 meters towards a man made dam. The dam was erected at the crossroad between Mieh Mieh and present day Seyroub neighborhood in Darb es Seem. The Palestinian camp is located between 1000m to 1500m to the West, away from the natural spring.
Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, (Fakhr-al-Din Ibn Mann, Fakhr-al-Din al Maani), was given the title "Emir" or Prince in Arabic because the Maan dynasty reigned over Lebanon at that time. Lebanon was divided into several emirates (the state or jurisdiction of an emir). So, there was an emirate out of several called, “Emirate of Ain al-Hilweh” and had an Emir. The emirate stretched Northwest from the Ain al-Hilweh spring, looped around the bottom of Mieh Mieh village along present day Officers’ Military Club straight North to the Barghout Creek (between Mieh Mieh and Haret Saida) and West to the Mediterranean Sea. From the South, the emirate stretched straight West to the Mediterranean Sea. So the present day Palestinian refugee camp got its name from the Emirate Ain al-Hilweh.
History.
Establishment.
It was established in 1948 on a rental/lease basis. 
1982 fighting.
During the First Lebanon War (1982), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) landed north of Sidon and the city was subjected to a heavy aerial bombing, causing heavy casualties among the civilian population. Dov Yermiya was to later liken the bombardment used on the refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh as of an intensity which recalled the quantity of bombs used in World War 2. The destruction was 100%. There was prolonged fighting in Ein el-Hilweh, culminating with the Palestinian defenders making a last stand at a mosque which was thereupon blown up by the IDF. Israeli historian Gil'ad Be'eri gives the following account
(...) The Refugee camps were heavily fortified, full of bunkers and fire positions. The Palestinian defence at Ein El Hilweh and other refugee camps was based on hand-carried anti-tank weapons such as the RPG (Rocket propelled grenade). (...) The IDF was not prepared for this kind of fighting, having at hand mainly armoured forces intended for use in open areas. The built-up area inhibited long-range weapons, created an equality between the tank and the RPG (often wielded by 13- or 14-year old boys), and increased the number of Israeli casualties. (...) Palestinian resistance seriously disrupted the timetable of the planned rapid advance to Beirut. It took eight days before the final crushing of resistance in Ein El Hilweh. The method adopted by the army was to use loud-speakers to call upon the civilian population to move away, search the houses one by one, surround points of remaining active resistance and subdue them by overwhelming fire.
Fatah take over of 1990.
In the 1980s most Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon were dominated by Syrian-backed Palestinian groups. In the late 1980s members of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, after a being ousted in other refugee camps moved on to Ain al-Hilweh. After fighting a bloody three day conflict with the Abu Nidal Organization Fatah members were able to establish dominance in Ain al-Hilweh. However by 1993 another group led by Fatah's top military commander in the camp, Col. Mounir Maqdah known as the Black September 13 Brigade, with support from Hezbolla and Iran, gained dominance over mainstream Fatah members in the camp. Maqdahhad's dominance was short-lived as he rejoined Fatah in 1998 after the Palestinian Authority began funding the camp again. A Lebanese court convicted the leader of Fatah in Lebanon, Sultan Abu al-Aynayn, of "forming an armed gang" and sentenced him in absentia to death.
2003 Fatah and Osbat al-Nour conflict.
In May 2003 fighting broke out between members of Osbat al-Nour and Fatah militia members in Ain al-Hilweh after the near-fatal shooting of Osbat al-Nour leader Abdullah Shraidi on May 17, Roughly 200 Osbat al-Nour fundamentalist fighters attacked Fatah offices. Eight people were killed and 25 wounded in the fighting at Ain al-Hilweh. Schools in the Ain al-Hilweh camp were shut and most stores kept their shutters down at the height of the fighting, which provoked an exodus by hundreds of camp residents. Two months after the ambush Abdullah Shraidi died from wounds received during the attack. Fatah agreed to a ceasefire after failing to defeat the fundamentalists in the camp.
2005 arrests.
In July 2005 four members of the Islamic Liberation Party were arrested. The Lebanese authorities claimed that the group had connections with Syria and that the group has participated in terrorist attacks in various arab countries. Palestinian sources described the moves as a step toward the disarmament of their factions, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559.
Clashes during the 2007 Lebanon conflict.
On June 3, 2007, Jund al-Sham fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a Lebanese Army checkpoint near Sidon, prompting a response from the Lebanese Army leading to clashes in the camp. These clashes follow a tense three weeks in Lebanon's north, where the Lebanese Army has been battling militant group Fatah al-Islam at the Palestinian refugee camp Nahr al-Bared.
2008 clashes.
In March 2008 fighting broke out between members of the Fatah faction and the Islamist group Jund al-Sham.
Influx of refugees from Syria.
The conditions in the camp have been exacerbated by an influx of previously Syrian-based Palestinian refugees, as a result of the Syrian civil war. As a result of this influx, camp's population has swelled from 70,000 to as much as 120,000.
As of 2014, the camp suspected of being a popular destination for jihadist rebels fleeing neighbouring Syria, particularly after the Syrian Army, backed by the Shia Lebanese militia Hezbollah, regained control of Yabroud from the rebels in March 2014.

Zoé

Zoé is a Latin Grammy Award-winning Mexican alternative/psychedelic band. They initially formed in Mexico City in 1994, although membership started to stabilize in 1997. The band has achieved success in Mexico and most Spanish-speaking countries with albums such as "Rocanlover", "Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón Atómico de la Vía Láctea" and "Reptilectric".
History.
Zoé's history begins in Mexico in 1994, as Britpop was becoming popular in the United Kingdom. Mainly inspired by this movement, with slight influences from Seattle's grunge, Zoé would go through a period of changing lineups and varying styles before stabilizing in 1997, with León Larregui (guitar and voice), Sergio Acosta (guitar), Alberto Cabrera (drums), Ángel Mosqueda (bass), and Jesus Báez (keyboards). By this time, a clear influence from The Beatles could be seen alongside the aforementioned Britpop and grunge stylings.
1998–2004: Debut album and "Rocanlover".
Faced with a lack of venues in which to showcase their music, Zoé relied upon self-organized concerts, the Internet, and a self-published demo. All of these efforts, plus a good deal of positive word of mouth, helped them gain popularity in Spanish-language radio stations in the United States. They signed their first recording contract in 1998, but nothing came of it. They independently released a debut album in 2000 that attracted the attention of Sony Music, who in turn took over distribution of the album. Popular songs from this recording included "Asteroide" and "Miel." Following the success of this album, some of their songs were included in the soundtracks of movies like "Amar Te Duele", "Ladies Night", and "The Dreamer".
In November 2003, Zoé launched their second album, produced by Phil Vinall, who had previously worked with the likes of Placebo and Elastica. This new album was titled "Rocanlover", and the main singles were "Peace and Love," "Love," and "Veneno." By this point, their musical style was clearly defined and easily recognizable, as was their style of mixing Spanish and English in their lyrics.
2004–2007 "The Room", "Rocanlover", and "Memo Rex Commander".
Zoé left Sony in early 2004; the band kept on working and touring during the whole year without a label behind them and started to gain a big following with the self-promoted singles "Love" and "Veneno." In early 2005, the band started working on new songs for their next album. By mid-2005, the band recorded the song "Dead" with their own resources. Also by this time Beto Cabrera left the band and Rodrigo Guardiola joined. Some major labels in Mexico were very interested in signing the band, but Zoé, tired of their bad past experiences, surprised everyone and signed an indie deal with Noiselab, a fast-growing independent label from Mexico. New songs to complete the EP, named "The Room", were written. The EP became an instant hit, going Gold after selling more than 50,000 units. Some new songs were recorded in English, and some producers, like Alan McGee, expressed interest in taking them to the UK and Europe. The release of the EP was followed by two sold-out shows at the Metropolitan Theater in Mexico City and a national tour.
The first six months of 2006 were quite active for Zoé; they kept playing strategic shows like the Vive Latino Festival and devoted themselves to the production of their third studio album. In January, the band went to Manzanillo to start preproduction with British producer Phil Vinall. February followed with shows and more preproduction in México City, and March was used for basic tracking at Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, Texas. In April, postproduction and more shows; the songs were mixed in May; and the album was finished by early June.
"Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón Atómico de la Vía Láctea" (Memo Rex Commander and the Atomic Heart of the Milky Way) came out on July 12, 2006, going straight in at number one in the Mexican charts. The first single from the album, "Vía Láctea," had some rotation in local music channels like MTV Latin America and Telehit. The album achieved gold record status after more than 40,000 units sold in the four weeks after its release and it received very good reviews from the specialized press.
On September 1, 2006, Zoé performed in Mexico's National Auditorium, a sold-out show in one of the most important stages for music in Mexico; later, at the Palacio de los Deportes, they performed along with Nick McCarthy, guitarist (and sometimes vocalist) from Scottish band Franz Ferdinand. In November 2006, they toured with Gustavo Cerati and Los Tres in Mexico and the United States. On November 28, 2007 they recorded their first live CD/DVD, in the Palacio de los Deportes "Sports Palace", the CD version is available with the title of 281107.
2008–2010 "Reptilectric".
In the fall of 2008, Zoé released their fourth album entitled "Reptilectric". It was produced by Phill Vinall. The title track was released as the fist single on September 8. The album debuted at number one in the Mexican charts and it was subsequently certified platinum for over 80,000 copies sold in that country. The band toured in support of the album throughout Mexico, Latin America, the United States, and Spain. A remix album called "Reptilectric Revisitado" was released in October 2009, featuring remixed versions of the songs on the original album as well as cover versions by other Latin American artists. In Spain, the band released "01-10", a compilation album of some of the band's biggest hits and new versions of songs from "Reptilectric" and "Memo Rex Commander" featuring Spanish artists Enrique Bunbury, Anni B. Sweet, Dorian, and Vetusta Morla. The band performed at Coachella in support of "Reptilectric".
2011-2012 "Música de Fondo".
In March 2011 the band released an MTV Unplugged album titled "Música de Fondo" ("Ambient Music"), featuring new interpretations of their biggest hits as well as new music. Guest performers included Adrian Dargelos, Enrique Bunbury, Chetes, and Denise Gutiérrez of Hello Seahorse!. Four singles were released from the album: "Soñé", "Labios Rotos", "Luna", and a cover of "Bésame Mucho". With this album, the band was nominated for awards at the Latin Grammy, Lunas Del Auditorio, and MTV Europe Music Awards. In October 2011 the album went Gold in Colombia, making it the band's first album to reach Gold outside of Mexico. As a personal thank you for the overwhelming success of this album, the band released a special single called "Energía" (""Energy"") in February 2012.
2013-2014 "Programaton".
Zoé releases 5th album name programaton and announce a extence tour of 75 shows on 16 countries. In this new stage, Zoe presents what can be labeled the most mature and experimental work. The elements that achieve this combination of music, lyrics and instrumental talents are Leon Larregui (vocals, guitar), Sergio Acosta (guitar), Jesús Báez (keyboards), Angel Mosqueda (bass) and Rodrigo Guardiola (drums).

Fanny Parkes (née Frances Susannah Archer) (1794–1875) was a Welsh travel writer. 
She was born in Conwy, Wales, the daughter of Anne and Major Edward Caulfield Archer, 16th Lancers, ADC to Lord Combermere and author of "Tours in upper India, and in parts of the Himalaya Mountains; with accounts of the courts of the native princes, &c." She married Charles Crawford Parkes, a Writer for the East India Company. 
Her detailed memoirs written in a lively style reveal her independence of mind. Parkes allows a pre-colonial perspective of northern India, its peoples and customs, recording changes in Britain’s governing of India, the economic impact of such policies, and domestic problems in Indian society, 1822-45. She describes attending colonial activities in Calcutta; learning Hindustani; farming at Allahabad. Describing Muslim customs; a history of Hindu theology; Methodism as found in higher native social classes. Europeans’ lack of respect for Indian culture. Famine in Kanauj; travelling over mountains from Landour to Simla. Discussing laws governing married women in England as unfair. Describing Delhi; natural beauty of Indian scenery. Benares: snake charmers, temples, sugar mills. Describing Afghan peoples and customs. Parkes’ narrative reflects her admiration and respect for the richness of Indian culture. The memoir includes a glossary of terms and a collection of translated Indian proverbs.
The memoirs were published as "Wanderings of a Pilgrim in search of the Pictureseque During four and twenty years in the East with revelations of Life in the Zenana" (Pelham Richardson, 1850); 
William Dalrymple has rediscovered and edited this 'unique and wonderful' travelogue on India as "Begums, Thugs & Englishmen, The Journals of Fanny Parkes" (Penguin Publishers).
Her book is 'unique' because Fanny Parkes is at once an observant, fluent, compassionate, intelligent and fairly without prejudice as a travel writer in the mid-19th century when British arrogance on the colonised peoples colored almost all printed material written in the English language. This book is one rare exception. Its 'wonderful', because the writing style of Parkes is amazingly contemporary and unless one is reminded, it would be impossible to guess that these journals were written almost 175 years ago. Her observations cover almost all aspects of a European living and travelling in the early 19th century in India.

'"FANNY PARKES OF CAWNPORE
“A PILGRIM IN SEARCH OF THE PICTURESQUE”
On April 22, Mr. Frank Mudie the retiring Collector of Cawnpore, unveiled at the “Collector’s House”, a brass tablet commemorating the residence there of Fanny Parkes, whose husband, during the period April 1830 – Feb. 1831, was acting Collector of Customs at Cawnpore.
Few of the present generation have heard of Fanny Parkes and it is interesting to note that after a lapse of over 100 years, it was only last year that the fact that she lived in the “Collector’s House” was brought to light by a Cawnpore resident, A.Grezo, who, reading that fascinating and very scarce book “Wanderings of a Pilgrim in search of the Picturesque” suddenly realized that Fanny Parkes description of her Bungalow applied exactly to the “Collector’s House”.
FACILE PEN
Fanny Parkes was a lady of exceptional personality, cultured, observant and enterprising, who could wield a very facile pen. To her, we owe the best and most fascinating account we possess of Indian life in the early part of the last century. She was the daughter of Major E.C. Archer, A.D.C. to Lord Combermere and may have inherited her literary taste from her father who wrote a book “Tours in Upper India” published in 1833. Fanny Parkes came out to India in 1822 and left the Country finally in 1845. In 1850, her two bulky volumes of the “Wanderings of a Pilgrim in search of the Picturesque” appeared in London. 
Douglas Dewar thus describes the lady in his charming book “Bygone days in India”.
“Mrs. Fanny Parkes came out to India in 1822 as the wife of an Indian Civilian going out to India to join the Company’s Service. She resided in the Country for more than 20 years, spending the greater part of that period at Allahabad and Cawnpore. During the whole of her stay in India she kept a journal. Upon this is based her “Wanderings of a Pilgrim in search of the Picturesque”. This consists of two bulky volumes and was published in 1850.
In 1833 she visited Mussoorie. Her book is an Anglo-Indian classic. It contains a great detail more than notes on current events and descriptions of the social life of the English in India. In it there are chapters dealing with thuggee and the Hindu and Muhammadan religions. She discourses on such multifarious subjects as the Gardner family, life in the Zenana and the useful plants of India. Everyone, who reads her book is captivated by it and like Sleeman’s “Rambles and Recollections” it has become a classic”.
An extract from THE GUARDIAN Newspaper, UK.
"Saturday June 9, 2007"
Fanny Parkes's exuberant journals trace her journey from prim memsahib to sitar-playing Indophile and provide one of the most enjoyable accounts of colonial India, discovers William Dalrymple. 
Lady of the Raj
I first heard about the great early Victorian travel writer Fanny Parkes when I was given a first edition of her book, Wanderings of a Pilgrim in Search of the Picturesque, by an old lady who in many ways resembled Parkes, and whose life had been greatly influenced by her writings.
Iris Portal was in her late 70s when I met her, a feisty yet remarkably liberal and intelligent relic of the Raj. She was the younger sister of the politician Rab Butler and had grown up in an academic family in Cambridge, where her father was the master of a college. But in her teens, to her family's horror, Iris had fallen in love with a dashing polo-playing cavalry officer, and suddenly found herself transported from the bookish banks of the Cam to a bleak military cantonment in central India. There the commanding officer's wife soon warned her not to let it be known that she wrote poetry, "as it might give the wrong impression".
Iris was, however, far too intelligent and independent-minded a woman to let the CO's wife get in her way, and she soon took to riding out to the bazaars and ruins that surrounded the army camps where she was based, learning the languages and exploring the history, a trajectory that eventually turned her into the distinguished biographer of, among others, the British governor general Lord Wellesley.
It was as a young army wife that Iris discovered the writings of Fanny Parkes, and immediately recognised a kindred spirit. A century before her, in the early 1830s, Parkes had also become a bored young wife in India, in her case married to an official in Allahabad whose job was to make ice. Like Iris, she ran away from the stiff officialdom of the Raj and immersed herself in the country. Soon Parkes was exploring the length and breadth of the country, and, on returning to England, she wrote possibly the most enjoyable and exuberant travel book to come out of the south Asia of the East India Company.
It was Parkes's curiosity and enthusiasm that distinguished her approach to India, and her journal traces her journey from prim memsahib, married to a minor civil servant of the Raj, to eccentric sitar-playing Indophile, critical of British rule and passionate in her appreciation of Indian culture. All this in time provided inspiration and a template for Iris's own life.
I had known Iris for a decade or so when she sent a postcard asking me to come and see her in Cambridge, as she had something for me. By this stage of her life, Iris was a widow in her early 80s. She had given up her house in Norfolk and had moved to a sheltered housing complex off the M11 in Cambridge, an institution she hated and found far more constricting than cantonment life. She had begun to prepare for her final journey, and was distributing her last things to her friends. She wanted me to have her copy of Parkes, she said, as she thought that I, like her, would find in it a kindred spirit. Maybe, she suggested, I would even like to try to get the book back in print, as unlike her more famous contemporary Emily Eden, Parkes had never had another edition.
That night, I opened up the two heavy volumes, filled with the author's own illustrations, and immediately fell under Parkes's spell. While Eden was witty and intelligent but waspish and conceited, Parkes was an enthusiast and an eccentric with a love of India that is imprinted on almost every page of her book. From her first arrival in Calcutta, she wrote how "I was charmed by the climate; the weather was delicious; and I thought India a most delightful country ... could I have gathered around me the dear ones I had left in England, my happiness would have been complete."
That initial intuition was reinforced the longer she stayed in south Asia. In the 24 years she lived in India, the country never ceased to surprise, intrigue and delight her, and she was never happier than when off on another journey, exploring new parts of the country: "Oh the pleasure," she wrote, "of vagabondising in India!"
Partly it was the beauty of the place that hypnotised her. She found Indian men "remarkably handsome", while her response to the landscape was no less admiring: "The evenings are cool and refreshing ... The foliage of the trees, so luxuriously beautiful and so novel, is to me a source of constant admiration." But it was not just the way the place looked. The longer she stayed in India, the more Parkes fell in love with the culture, history, flowers, trees, religions, languages and peoples of the country, and the more she felt possessed by an overpowering urge to pack her bags and set off to explore: "How much there is to delight the eye in this bright, this beautiful world! Roaming about with a good tent and a good Arab , one might be happy for ever in India."
It is this joy, excitement and even liberation in travel that Parkes managed to communicate so well, in striking contrast to the haughty ennui of so many of her male contemporaries. In the same way, it is her insatiable curiosity and love of the country that immediately engages readers and carries them with her as she bumbles her way across India on her own. She is wilfully dismissive of the dangers of dacoits or thugs or tigers, as she turns her hand to learning the sitar, enquiring about the intricacies of Hindu mythology, trying opium and collecting Hindu statuary, butterflies, zoological specimens preserved in spirits, Indian aphorisms and Persian proverbs - all with unstoppable glee.
Even when she disliked a particular Indian custom, she often found herself engaged intellectually. Watching the Churuk Puja, or "hook swinging", when pious Hindus attached hooks into the flesh of their backs and were swung about on ropes hanging from great cranes for the amusement of the crowds below, she wrote: "I was much disgusted, but greatly interested."
The longer she stayed in India, the more Parkes became slowly Indianised. The professional memsahib, herself the daughter of a colonial official (Captain William Archer), who came to India to watch over her colonial administrator husband, was gradually transformed into a fluent Urdu speaker, who spent less and less of her time at her husband's mofussil (up-country) posting, and more and more of her time travelling around to visit her Indian friends. Aesthetically she grew slowly to prefer Indian dress to that of the English. At one point, watching celebrations at the Taj Mahal, she noted how "crowds of gaily dressed and most picturesque natives were seen in all directions passing through the avenue of fine trees, and by the side of the fountains to the tomb: they added great beauty to the scene, whilst the eye of taste turned away pained and annoyed by the vile round hats and stiff attire of the European gentlemen, and the equally ugly bonnets and stiff and graceless dresses of the English ladies."
Gradually, over the years she lived in India, Parkes's views began to change. Having assumed at first that good taste was the defining characteristic of European civilisation and especially that of her own people, she found her assumptions being challenged by what she came to regard as the philistinism of the English in India, and by the beauty of so much of the country.
At the end of her travels, Parkes looked forward to seeing her family in England. Yet when she finally set foot on English soil again, her return was a moment not for rejoicing, but for depression and disappointment: "We arrived at 6am. May flowers and sunshine were in my thoughts. But instead [...] it was bitterly cold walking up from the boat - rain, wind and sleet, mingled together, beat on my face. Everything on landing was so wretchedly mean, especially the houses, which are built of slate stone; it was cold and gloomy . . . I felt a little disgusted."
When she arrived home, her mother barely recognised her. It was as if the current of colonisation had somehow been reversed: the coloniser had been colonised. India had changed and transformed Fanny Parkes. She could never be the same again.
In due course, I did manage to persuade a friend to produce a new edition of Parkes's Wanderings of a Pilgrim in Search of the Picturesque, and a few years ago I spent a very happy three weeks rereading her book and editing down her two huge volumes into one manageable paperback containing all my favourite passages - Begums, Thugs and White Mughals: The Journals of Fanny Parkes (Eland). Sadly, Iris died shortly before the book appeared, and I was never able to tell her that I had kept my promise.
Parkes is an important writer because she acts as a witness to a forgotten moment of British-Indian hybridity, and shows that colonial travel writing need not be an aggressive act of orientalist appropriation - not "gathering colonial knowledge", as Edward Said and his followers would have us believe, but instead an act of understanding. As Colin Thubron has pointed out, it is ridiculously simplistic to see all attempts at studying, observing and empathising with another culture necessarily "as an act of domination - rather than of respect or even catharsis ... If even the attempt to understand is seen as aggression or appropriation, then all human contact declines into paranoia."
When reading travel accounts by early visitors to the east, such as Parkes, we should certainly try to resist the temptation, felt by so many historians, to project back on to it the stereotypes of late Victorian and Edwardian behaviour and attitudes with which we are so familiar. These attitudes were clearly entirely at odds with the actual fears and hopes, anxieties and aspirations of the early travellers in India, who did not look at south Asia with the hauteur of the high colonial, as much as with the pleasure and surprise of the inquisitive wanderer, in search, as Parkes would have it, of the picturesque.

Jim Agnew

Jim Agnew (born March 21, 1966) is a Canadian retired professional hockey defenceman.
A stay-at-home, physical defender, Agnew was also an excellent fighter. He was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the 8th round (157th overall) in the 1984 NHL Entry Draft. After a stellar career in the Western Hockey League with the Brandon Wheat Kings and Portland Winter Hawks, Agnew turned pro and signed with the Canucks in 1986.
Playing career.
Agnew spent most of the 1986–87 in the AHL, although he did receive a four-game call-up to the Canucks. He would spend four full seasons in Vancouver's minor-league system while seeing occasional action in Vancouver - he played 10 games for the team in the 1987–88 and recorded his only career point, and was called up again for 7 games in 1989–90.
While playing for the Canucks in March 1990, Agnew seriously injured his left knee and required surgery. This would be the start of a chronic knee problem - injuries to his left knee caused him to miss significant action 6 times over the next four seasons, and required three separate surgeries.
Unfortunately, his knee problems struck just as he made the NHL on a full-time basis. He spent virtually the entire 1990–91 and 1991–92 seasons on the Canuck roster as a utility player seeing action at both forward and defence, but was limited to just 44 games over that stretch due to injury and failed to record a point.
He was released by the Canucks in 1992 and signed as a free agent with the Hartford Whalers. Again, however, he was limited to only 16 games by an injury to his left knee. After injuring his knee again during the Whalers' 1993 training camp, he decided to retire.
Agnew appeared in 81 NHL games over parts of six seasons, recording 1 assist and 257 penalty minutes.
After his playing days were over, Agnew moved to Missoula, Montana, became a United States citizen, and found work as a law enforcement officer.

Chillisquaque Creek

Chillisquaque Creek is a tributary of the West Branch Susquehanna River in, Montour and Northumberland counties, Pennsylvania in the United States.
A part of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, the Chillisquaque Creek watershed drains parts of four counties (the two mentioned and Columbia County and Lycoming County). The creek flows southwest in a valley of the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians, through sandstone, shale, and limestone.
As of 2000, the creek and its watershed are rural, with 67.9% of the watershed given to agriculture and 29.5% covered by forest and a population of 6,620.
Name.
According to Donehoo, "Chillisquaque" is a corruption of the Shawnee name "Chililisuagi", meaning "place of the snow birds". There was a Shawnee village near the mouth of the creek from about 1728, and it is mentioned in the journals of several early colonial visitors to the area. It is "Shallyschohking" in the earliest record of the creek and village, a 1732 petition from the Shawnee to the Province of Pennsylvania government. In 1737 Conrad Weiser wrote it as "Zilly-squachne" as he crossed the creek and traveled through the village on his way north to the Iroquois capital Onondaga. In 1754 it was "Chelisquaqua", and Scull's map of 1759 has "Chillisquaquy". By 1770 (when the first white settlers arrived) another Scull map has the current name. All these are variations of "Chalakatha", one of the five Shawnee tribal bands and the name of the village where that band resided, usually rendered in English as "Chillicothe".
The name "Chillisquaque Creek" is unique in the USGS Geographic Names Information System and on its maps of the United States. Today the creek has given its name to East Chillisquaque and West Chillisquaque townships, as well as the unincorporated hamlet of Chillisquaque in the latter township, all in Northumberland County. The creek's major tributaries include the County Line Branch Chillisquaque Creek, as well as the East, Middle, and West Branches.

Bhuvan Shome

Bhuvan Shome is a 1969 Hindi film directed by Mrinal Sen. The cast includes Utpal Dutt (Mr. Bhuvan Shome) and Suhasini Mulay (Gauri, a village belle). Sen based his film on a Bengali story by Banaphool (Balai Chand Mukhopadhya). The film is considered a landmark in modern Indian cinema.
This was the debut film of Suhasini Mulay.
Plot.
Bhuvan Shome, a widower and a dedicated civil servant — strict, uncompromising – takes a holiday which transforms him irreparably though at the same time heightening his sense of isolation.
Bhuvan Shome is a "big officer" in the Indian Railways. The background of the film is constructed in the context of a few railway ticket checkers discussing him as a strict, unreasonable officer ("afsar"). It continues with him being described, by a narrator, as a man whose "Bengali"-ness has not been affected by his travels.
His apparent age, late 50s, is an important element of his psychology.
Inspired by hunting, Bhuvan Shome is seen to take a "hunting holiday" to Gujarat. It is quite clear that his expedition is amateurish. He is portrayed as an inept "hunter" rather than a man who knows how to acquire a skill.
His encounter with the young Gouri is fortuitous because it is she who takes care of him and helps "hunt" birds. She helps him through a barren wilderness, takes him home and takes care of him. When he is made to change his clothes because otherwise the "birds will know" and fly away is probably an important part of his transformation from a strict, conformist and aging man to one of a person more open to the stimuli of his environment.
The subsequent hunting sojourn of Gouri and Bhuvan Shome is a lyrical exploration of Bhuvan Shome's transformation. He is not only enamored by the simple beauty of Gouri, but also enchanted by the sights of birds on the lake and in the sky.
His hunt is "successful," but only in a way that reflects Bhuvan Shome's limitations as a man.
Bhuvan Shome is deeply affected by Gouri, who is actually schooled more than she could expect to be in that environment.
When he returns to his office chambers, he is seen to reprieve an offending railwayman. This is a sub-plot that completes the story and context of the initial narration.

Ian Stewart (baseball)

Ian Kenneth Stewart (born April 5, 1985) is an American professional baseball infielder for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Colorado Rockies and Chicago Cubs.
Baseball career.
Colorado Rockies.
Drafted in the 2003 MLB Draft first round out of La Quinta High School in Westminster, California, Stewart showed great promise in short-season rookie-league ball with the Casper Rockies in the Pioneer League. His .401 on-base percentage and .558 slugging average appeared to justify his first-round selection. In 2004, Stewart continued to progress in low-A ball at Asheville in the South Atlantic League with a .398 OBP and .594 SLG. "Baseball America" ranked him as the fourth best prospect in baseball behind Delmon Young, Félix Hernández and Joe Mauer.
In 2005, he began play in high-A ball in Modesto, California in the California League. He got off to a very slow start, hitting for a low average with little power. He went to extended spring training and came back to play with Modesto in June, 2005. Up until June 20, Stewart was hitting under .230 with few homers. His supposedly improving defense also suffered. However, Stewart rebounded later in the season and finished with a respectable .353 OBP and .497 SLG, although he showed a worrisome tendency to strike out.
Stewart played in the Arizona Fall League after the conclusion of the 2005 minor league season. Here, Stewart got off to a good start with impressive power. Unfortunately, he suffered a wrist injury while sliding into second base. The MRI showed limited damage, but any wrist injury is troublesome for a power hitter. He was shut down for the rest of the AFL.
Stewart was invited to the Colorado Rockies 2006 spring training. He began well, hitting six home runs and batting over .400 in the first few games. Stewart re-established himself as a power-hitting prospect, and the Rockies sent him to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the AA Texas League. Here Stewart began the season well, but fell into a slump that sent his average to .235 in mid-May before being sidelined with another injury. The injury was not serious, and Stewart only missed ten games. When he returned, Stewart improved noticeably and finished the season with a .351 on-base percentage and a .452 slugging average.
Stewart's power potential makes him a possibility for the Rockies' third base position. However, his performance at higher levels in the minors has tailed off from his impressive 2003-04 seasons. In 2007, he was selected to the All-Star Futures Game.
Stewart had his contract purchased on August 11, 2007, when Jeff Baker was placed on the disabled list. He made his major league debut on that same day when he started the game at third base. He was hitless in 2 at-bats but scored a run after he was hit by a pitch. His first hit was a double off Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs on August 12. He hit his first major league home run, a grand slam on August 21, 2007, against Tony Armas of the Pittsburgh Pirates, making him only the second Rockie ever to hit a grand slam as his first major league home run.
Stewart, in his limited time in the majors, endeared himself to fans by frequently signing autographs. He struggled early, striking out 28 times in his first 55 ABs, and was sent down to Colorado Springs to regain his hitting stroke. He found it once again, and was called back to the Majors on July 19. Stewart won the starting third base job when Garrett Atkins moved to first base in place for the injured Todd Helton.
Stewart received the NL Rookie of the Month award for his accomplishments in July 2008. He hit .432 with one home run, five doubles, eight runs scored and 15 RBIs in 12 games during the month of July. He also had a .614 slugging percentage and a .519 on-base percentage.
After being the Rockies regular third baseman for most of 2009 and 2010, he split 2011 between the Majors and AAA. In parts of 5 seasons with the Rockies, he hit .236 with 54 home runs and 187 RBI in 432 games.
Chicago Cubs.
On December 8, 2011, Stewart was traded from the Colorado Rockies along with Casey Weathers to the Chicago Cubs for Tyler Colvin and DJ LeMahieu.
He started the season playing third base with occasional starts by Jeff Baker, another former Rockie. On June 16, 2012, Stewart underwent wrist surgery and was put on the 60-day disabled list. In 55 games he hit .201 with 5 home runs and 17 RBI.
On December 6, 2012, Stewart re-signed a 1-year $2 million deal with the Cubs. He played in 40 games with the AAA Iowa Cubs, hitting .168 and was released on June 25.
Los Angeles Dodgers.
On July 5, 2013 he signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who assigned him to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes. He hit just .174 in 27 games before he was released on August 12.
Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.

VFA-131

Strike Fighter Squadron 131 (VFA-131), also known as the "Wildcats", is a United States Navy F/A-18C Hornet fighter squadron stationed at Naval Air Station Oceana. Their radio call sign alternates between "Cat" and "Cougar" and their aircraft tail code is "AG".
Mission.
The mission of VFA-131 is combat readiness as a part of U.S. Atlantic Fleet Carrier Strike Forces, utilizing the F/A-18 aircraft to project power ashore and at sea, to defend the fleet against air and sea threats and to carry out all other missions which may be assigned by cognizant authority.
Squadron Insignia and Nickname.
The squadron’s insignia was approved by Chief of Naval Operations on 26 January 1984.
History.
1980s.
VFA-131 was established at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, on 2 October 1983, and trained in the F/A-18 Hornet under VFA-125. The squadron received their first FA-18A in May 1984. In January 1985, the Wildcats moved to Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida, becoming the Atlantic Fleet’s first FA-18 squadron.
As a part of Carrier Air Wing 13 (CVW-13), the squadron deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in October 1985 aboard USS Coral Sea (CV-43).
In March 1986 during Freedom of Navigation exercises in the Gulf of Sidra, the squadron’s aircraft flew Combat Air Patrols during which a Libyan SA-5 Gammon missile was fired against an American aircraft operating in international waters. On 14–15 April 1986, squadron aircraft participated in Operation El Dorado Canyon, along with other units of CVW-13 and A-7 Corsair IIs from CVW-1, providing air-to-surface Shrike and HARM strikes against Libyan surface-to-air missile sites at Benghazi. This was the first use of the F/A-18 in combat.
In October 1988, the squadron joined Carrier Air Wing 7 and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea aboard USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) in March 1990. In August 1990, they were among the units to respond to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Shield.
The "Wildcats" embarked in USS Independence (CV-62) from 15 August–8 October 1988 for the carrier’s transit from NS Norfolk to its new home port at NAS North Island via Cape Horn.
1990s.
In August 1990 while embarked in USS Eisenhower (CVN-69), squadron’s F/A-18s flew missions in the Red Sea in support of Operation Desert Shield, the build-up of American and Allied forces to counter a threatened invasion of Saudi Arabia by Iraq and as part of an economic blockade of Iraq to force its withdrawal from Kuwait. The "Eisenhower" task force was the first U.S. force in position to deter Iraqi incursion into Saudi Arabia.
Upon return from deployment in September 1990, the squadron transitioned to FA-18C Lot XIII Night Strike Hornets. One year later, the squadron again deployed aboard "Eisenhower" to the Red Sea and North Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Storm.
In May 1994, the squadron was part of the maiden deployment of USS George Washington (CVN-73). They flew sorties in support of Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia-Herzegovina and Operation Southern Watch over Southern Iraq. In October 1994, they returned to the Persian Gulf and participated in Operation Vigilant Warrior, in response to Iraqi aggression.
In April 1996 the Wildcats once again deployed aboard "Washington" to the Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea, and the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Decisive Endeavor and Operation Southern Watch. In February 1998, the squadron deployed for the “Around the World”, maiden deployment of USS John C. Stennis (CVN-74), again supporting Operation Southern Watch in Iraq. Upon return to the United States in December 1998, they relocated from NAS Cecil Field, Florida, to NAS Oceana in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
2000s.
On September 11, 2001, the squadron was underway aboard USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) off the Virginia Capes. Within hours of the attacks, armed Wildcat Hornets were conducting air patrols over the Washington D.C. and New York City as part of Operation Noble Eagle. In February 2002, the squadron deployed to the North Arabian Sea to take part in Operation Enduring Freedom, flying combat sorties over Afghanistan. From January to July 2004, VFA-131 deployed aboard USS George Washington (CVN-73) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The squadron deployed from October 2006 to June 2007 aboard Eisenhower in support of OIF, OEF, and operations in Somalia.

Charles D. Lancaster, Jr.

Charles D. Lancaster, Jr. (born September 22, 1943), is a Metairie attorney who was until January 14, 2008, the then longest-serving Republican member of the Louisiana House of Representatives. He represented what has become District 80 in a portion of populous Jefferson Parish (suburban New Orleans) for eight nonconsecutive four-year terms. In 2007, Lancaster was term-limited and could not seek reelection. His successor is fellow Republican Joseph Lopinto, who defeated another Republican, Glenn Lee, 6,170 (59 percent) to 4,357 (41 percent) in the October 20 nonpartisan blanket primary.
Early years and education.
Lancaster graduated from Jesuit High School in New Orleans. He obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He received his Juris Doctor degree from Loyola University law school in New Orleans. He is a fellow in the Loyola University Institute of Politics.
Lancaster was chairman of the House Government Affairs Committee. He served on the Executive Committee, the Legislative Budgetary Control Council, and the 
Special Committee on Disaster Planning. He held subcommittee positions in Disaster Planning, Crisis Management, and Recovery and Long-Term Revitalization. 
From 1968-1993, Lancaster was a major in the United States Army Reserve.
An active Republican.
Lancaster was an active Republican party builder during his long legislative career. In 1982, he was voted the "Outstanding Legislator" by the American Conservative Union. In 2006, he chaired the Republican Legislative Delegation Campaign Committee in preparation for the 2007 state elections. In 2004, Lancaster hosted a gala to honor the defection of Democratic Congressman Rodney Alexander of Quitman in Jackson Parish to the Republican Party. Lancaster had served with Alexander in the legislature. He had also served with Alexander's 2004 opponent John W. "Jock" Scott of Alexandria, when Scott was a Democrat and later when Scott too switched to the Republican Party. But incumbency drew Lancaster to support Alexander over Scott.
Lancaster was first elected when he was twenty-eight to the state House in the 1972 general election on the Republican ticket headed by gubernatorial nominee David C. Treen, then of Jefferson Parish. Lancaster that year defeated Democrat Calvin P. "Chuck" Lee, 6,018 votes (53.3 percent) to 5,281 (46.7 percent. At the time he was the only Republican of the thirteen House members whose districts included a portion of Jefferson Parish. And he was one of only four Republicans in the legislature in his first term. None of the four, including Lancaster, Arthur W. Sour, Jr., and B.F. O'Neal, Jr., both of Shreveport (Caddo Parish) and Edward Clark Gaudin of Baton Rouge (East Baton Rouge Parish), still serve in the body. Sour and O'Neal are deceased. 
Lancaster lost his seat in 1975, when no Republican sought the governorship in the wake of the popularity of Democrat Edwin Washington Edwards. He returned to the legislature in 1980, when Treen was inaugurated as governor, after a narrow victory in the 1979 general election. Lancaster received 61.1 percent the 1979 election. Two other Republicans, Terry W. Gee and Charles Grisbaum, Jr., were also elected from Jefferson Parish to join Lancaster in the delegation. Grisbaum had been a Democrat prior to his change of parties in 1978 and was then elected as a Republican in 1979.
In Lancaster's last election, the 2003 jungle primary, he defeated fellow Republican Charles H. Sclafani in his district, which had become reliably GOP-inclined over Lancaster's tenure.
Lancaster is a conservative Roman Catholic who sported a 0 percent voting record as scored by the National Abortion Rights Action League. He is also generally a favorite of business—the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry ranked him a 70 percent score; the AFL-CIO rated him 58. The Louisiana Hospital Association granted him 100 percent. The Louisiana Environmental Action Network rated him 56 percent. The conservative Louisiana Family Forum rated him only 50 percent, but the Louisiana Electorate of Gays And Lesbians gave him a zero. One of Lancaster's Democratic colleagues during the first term, R. Harmon Drew, Sr., of Minden in Webster Parish, was said to consider Lancaster among the two keenest members of the whole legislature. In his final term, Lancaster was one of six Republicans from Jefferson Parish. The GOP members in the Jefferson delegation by then outnumbered the Democrats, 6-4.
After Lancaster left the legislature, his party by 2011 through regular and special elections and defections gained a majority of the seats, 55 of the 105 slot.
Legal practice.
In his private practice of law in Metairie, Lancaster handles primarily cases involving Driving Under The Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), Personal Injury, and Wills, Trusts & Estates. 
His affiliations include the American Legislative Exchange Council, the Jefferson Parish Bar Association, the Louisiana Bar Association, the Jefferson Performing Arts Society, the New Orleans Sports Foundation, the Southern Republican Exchange, and the National Conference of State Legislators. He is also a former president of the National Republican Legislators Association.
Lancaster is married to the former Patches Shannon. Lancaster is Roman Catholic.

Iṉiyavai Nāṟpatu

Iniyavai Narpathu(Tamil: இனியவை நாற்பது) is a Tamil poetic work of didactic nature belonging to the "Pathinenkilkanakku" anthology of Tamil literature. This belongs to the 'post Sangam period corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. "Iniyavai Narpathu" is a collection of 40 poems written by the poet Putham Sernthanar describing the most desirable things in life. The poems of " Iniyavai Narpathu" are written in the Venpa meter.
This collection is very similar to "Inna Narpathu", which deals with the forty things one should avoid. "Inna Narpathu" includes four categories of things one should seek in life: learning even at the expense of begging, the advice of learned persons, healthy children, strength to not covet other's spouse.
"Iniyavai Narpathu", together with "Inna Narpathu" spells out in simple and succinct terms moral codes essential for daily life of the individual and for the society. They both emphasise the importance of education and individual responsibility in society.

Leuckart reaction

The Leuckart reaction is the chemical reaction that converts aldehydes or ketones to amines by reductive amination in the presence of heat. The reaction, named after Rudolf Leuckart, proceeds via two mechanisms: one using ammonium formate and the other using formamide as the reducing agent. It requires high temperatures, usually between 120 and 130 °C, although under the presence of formamide, the temperature can be greater than 165 °C. The reaction works best using ammonium formate and the general reaction can be seen below.
History.
The Leuckart reaction is named in honor of its developer, the German chemist Rudolf Leuckart (1854–1899). The son of the renowned zoologist Karl Georg Friedrich Rudolf Leuckart, Rudolf Leuckart received his PhD from the University of Leipzig in 1879, and later became a professor at the University of Göttingen. He stumbled upon this reaction when he discovered that heating benzaldehyde with formamide didn't produce benzylidenediformamide as he anticipated, but benzylamine. In 1891, a colleague of Leuckart at the University of Göttingen, Otto Wallach, performed further reactions using alicyclic and terpenoid ketones as well as aldehydes, demonstrating the general application. Over the course of the past century, chemists have discovered several methods to improve the yield of the reaction and carry it out under less strenuous conditions. Pollard and Young summarized various ways in which amines can be formed: using either formamide or ammonium formate, or both, or adding formic acid to formamide. However, using just ammonium formate as the reagent produces the best yields. Using formamide produces low yields compared to ammonium formate but yields can be increased by using large amount of formamide, or using ammonium formate, ammonium sulfate, and magnesium chloride as catalysts.
Mechanism.
Ammonium formate as reagent:
Ammonium formate first dissociates into formic acid and ammonia. Ammonia then performs a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon. The oxygen deprotonates hydrogen from nitrogen to form a hydroxyl. The hydroxyl is protonated using hydrogen from formic acid, which allows for water molecule to leave. This forms a carbocation, which is resonance stabilized. The compound attacks hydrogen from the deprotonated formic acid from previous step, forming a carbon dioxide and an amine.
Formamide as reagent:
Formamide first nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon. The oxygen is protonated by abstracting hydrogen from the nitrogen atom, subsequently forming a water molecule that leaves, forming N-formyl derivative, which is resonance stabilized. Water hydrolyzes formamide to give ammonium formate, which acts as a reducing agent and adds on to the N-formyl derivative. Hydride shift occurs, resulting in loss of carbon dioxide. Ammonium ion is added forming an imine and releasing ammonia. The imine goes through hydrolysis to form the amine, which is depicted in the scheme below.
Applications.
A notable example of the Leuckart reaction is its use in the synthesis of tetrahydro-1,4 benzodiazepin-5-one, a molecule that is part of the benzodiazepine family. Many compounds in this family of molecules are central nervous system suppressants and are associated with therapeutic uses and a variety of medications, such as antibiotics, antiulcer, and anti-HIV agents. Researchers were able to synthesize tetrahydro-1,4-benzodiazepin-5-ones with excellent yields and purities by utilizing the Leuckart Reaction. Researchers performed the reaction via solid-phase synthesis and used formic acid as the reducing agent.

Mark Pettini

Mark Lewis Pettini (born 7 August 1983 in Brighton) is an English cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman. He can also bowl right-arm medium-pace bowler and has also acted as Essex's wicket-keeper, but not for a number of years. Nicknamed "Swamps" by his Essex team mates.
Playing Style.
Mark Pettini is an aggressive batsman who specialises in one-day cricket. He usually opens the batting in one-day cricket so as to make use of the batting powerplay in the early overs. In County Championship cricket, Pettini bats in the middle-order. He fields in a wide range of positions, but usually fielded at mid-off during his time as captain. Pettini's bowling is very rarely used, and when it is used, it is often in a declaration agreement.
Playing career.
An expert in the limited overs game, he was one of the key cameo figures in Essex's 2005 domestic one-day league title winning season, having previously gained experience as an England Under-19 player, having played twice against India during their English tour of 2002.
Instrumental in achieving promotion for Essex during 2002, Pettini is known for his aggressive style of play. He has participated in the Twenty20 Cup each year since 2003, achieving a solid record in this competition.
His highest first-class score is 208 not out, made against Derbyshire in September 2006. A few days later, in the last match of the 2006 County Championship, he hit 114 from 29 balls, but this innings was made against "declaration bowling" and so will not be eligible for the Walter Lawrence Trophy. Nor will it count as a first-class record. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/counties/5373254.stm]
In July 2007, Pettini was included in England's provisional squad of 30 for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup, but a loss of form cost him a place in the final squad for the tournament.
In June 2007, Pettini became permanent captain of Essex County Cricket Club following the retirement of Ronnie Irani due to a knee injury. He had earlier held the job on a temporary basis while Irani was sidelined.
At the start of the 2008 season, Pettini decided to move from opener to number five in the Essex batting order in four-day cricket. This change was made due to his indifferent batting form during the second half of the 2007 season. However, he would continue as an opening batsman in one-day cricket.
Pettini began 2008 in superb form, hitting 153 not out against Cambridge UCCE, 80 not out in the LV County Championship Division Two opener against Northamptonshire at Chelmsford and 119 in Essex's first Friends Provident Trophy South East Division match against Kent at Canterbury.
However in Essex's next match, a county championship match against Derbyshire at Derby, Pettini was forced to miss the second and third days' play after suffering an astigmatism in his eye. He travelled to Cambridge to see a specialist for treatment. The eye problem would flare up again just a day before the county's Friends Provident Trophy final against Kent at Lord's.
Pettini's form tailed off somewhat, but he did hit a match-winning 144 against the Surrey Brown Caps in a Friends Provident Trophy match at the Brit Oval on Sunday 11 May 2008. That game saw Essex score 391–5 from their 50 overs. [http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/essex/engine/match/319829.html]
On 16 August 2008, Pettini captained Essex to victory in the Friends Provident Trophy final at Lord's. He scored 10 opening the batting as the Eagles beat Kent Spitfires by five wickets to lift their first one-day knockout trophy since 1997. [http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/countycricket2008/engine/current/match/319878.html]
Pettini's father, Max, is an astronomer. Mark himself graduated with an astronomy degree from Cardiff University and has a keen interest in the subject. He is also a keen fisherman and loves darts, attending a number of PDC events with best friend Alastair Cook. During the 2008 season, Pettini stated on his Sky Sports profile that his sporting hero is Sid Waddell.
Pettini also shares a house with Essex and England batsman Cook.
Pettini also writes a weekly column called "Pett Sounds" in the "Southend Echo" and "Colchester Gazette" newspapers. [http://www.echo-news.co.uk/sport/3590337.Petts_Sounds__Lovely_holiday__but_where_s_my_present__/]
On 22 October 2008 it was announced by Essex County Cricket Club that Pettini had signed a two-year contract extension until the end of the 2011 season.
After some poor form with the bat, Pettini decided to resign his county captaincy for all forms of the game in June 2010. James Foster took over as Essex captain. Pettini then took a few weeks off to work on his batting.

Olivier de Serres

Olivier de Serres (1539 – 1619) was a French author and soil scientist whose "Théâtre d'Agriculture" (1600) was the text book of French agriculture in the 17th century.
Serres was born at Villeneuve-de-Berg, Ardèche. His book was notable for its recommendation to wine growers that they plant 5-6 varieties in their vineyards to balance the risk of a crop failing, and the early advocating of crop rotation.
'Le théâtre de l'agriculture' recommends Métayage (Sharecropping) as cash tenants took all the risks so would demand lower rent while hired labour was expensive to manage. Sharecroppers administer themselves and risks are divided with the landlord. Olivier only thought large landowners should take the risk of hiring labourers and running the estate themselves.

Dennis Walaker

Dennis Walaker is the current mayor of Fargo, North Dakota in the United States. He was elected to a four-year term on June 13, 2006 and took office on June 28, 2006. He was re-elected during a municipal election which was held on June 8, 2010. 
On December 26, 2013, Walaker announced he would seek reelection in 2014. In an interview with the Fargo Forum, Walaker said there are just too many things going on in the city right now for him to leave. 
Biography.
Walaker attended Leonard High School in Cass County, North Dakota and North Dakota State University. He worked on the construction of Interstate 94, Interstate 29, and projects within the City of Fargo. Walaker was named City's Public Works Operations Manager in 1989. The scope of the position was later expanded to include emergency management, forestry, and fleet management.
He gained attention (locally and - on a smaller scale - nationally) in April 1997, while coordinating the city's efforts to fight the 1997 Red River Flood. After the flooding passed and the city was left mainly dry, Walaker was given some credit for the city's preparations. He gained similar notice for coordinating the response to the 2009 Red River flood, issuing an evacuation order at the height of the flood that included only children and the disabled. Although the city had been urged by state and federal agencies to issue a complete evacuation order, Walaker disagreed, stating that "There's just no way I could tell the people of the city of Fargo, after all the work they'd done, to evacuate." Walaker personally supervised the 2009 efforts in Fargo - described as "orchestrated primarily from inside City Hall" - by local volunteers working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coast Guard, and other federal agencies. 
Walaker is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a bi-partisan group with a stated goal of "making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets." The Coalition is co-chaired by former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He is also a member of the Mayors Climate Protection Center, and has been a board member or member of several local, regional, and national organizations, including the Red River Zoo, the Plains Art Museum, the American Public Works Association, the American Water Works Association, the Water pollution control federation, the American Legion, the Sons of Norway, the Hospice of the Red River Valley, and United Way.

Buffalo Bill State Park

Buffalo Bill State Park is a Wyoming state park in Park County, Wyoming, United States. The park surrounds a reservoir formed by the Buffalo Bill Dam on the Shoshone River. The park, reservoir and dam were named after William "Buffalo Bill" Cody who founded the nearby town of Cody and owned much of the land now occupied by the reservoir and park. Buffalo Bill State Park is open May 1 - September 30 with limited winter access. Recreational opportunities include camping, hiking, boating, fishing and picnicking.
History.
Buffalo Bill, William Cody, was one of the most colorful figures of the American Old West, and mostly famous for the shows he organized with cowboy themes. He once owned some of the land that is now part of the state park bearing his name. He sold his property to the United States government prior to the construction of Buffalo Bill Dam. Cody settled in the Shoshone Canyon area in the 1870s. He first came to the region as a guide for a survey expedition. Cody spent parts the next twenty years in the area serving as a hunting guide. Buffalo Bill worked to bring irrigation and agriculture development in Park County. He founded the nearby city of Cody in 1896.
Construction on Buffalo Bill Dam, originally known as Shoshone Dam, began in 1905. Upon completion, in 1910, the dam was the highest in the world standing at . The dam is a concrete arch-gravity dam on the Shoshone River in the U.S. state of Wyoming. It dam was part of the Shoshone Project, one of the first projects overseen by the Bureau of Reclamation. 
In addition to providing water for irrigation and downstream flood control, Buffalo Bill Dam provides hydropower for a power plant. The first and second units of the power plant were constructed in 1922. A third unit was built in 1931. Units one and two were decommissioned in 1980 and unit three was replaced in 1991.
The park was established in 1957 and rebuilt in 1993 after an eight year project to increase the height of the dam by . The original park facilities were flooded when the dam was raised and the reservoir was deepened and widened. The project added to the area of the lake. A visitors center at the dam was opened upon completion of the heightening of the dam. Further modifications to the dam included an expansion of the underground spillway and addition of gates to the spillway for flow control.
Geology.
Buffalo Bill State Park is in Shoshone Canyon along the Shoshone River in northwestern Wyoming. The mountainous area is part of the Absaroka Range of the Rocky Mountains.
The range is on the Montana-Wyoming border. They border the Beartooth Mountains to the north and the Wind River Range to the south. The mountains are named for the Absaroka Indians. The name is derived from the Hidatsa name for the Crow people; it means "children of the large-beaked bird." 
Recreation.
Buffalo Bill State Park surrounds Buffalo Bill Reservoir which is the center of recreation at the park. Recreational activities at the park include fishing, boating, hiking, camping and picnicking. The park is officially closed during the winter months, but limited recreation is available.
The park, like most of the state parks in Wyoming, is a "reservoir park." This has traditionally limited recreation to the waters of the reservoirs including boating, fishing and swimming. Plans are in place to build additional hiking trails in several Wyoming state parks. The state requires that the newly built trails do not fundamentally alter the landscape of the park. Funding for the trails comes from several federal and state funds and private donations. 
The picnic facilities at the park were updated in 2007 by the Wyoming Conservation Corps. The corps also built fences at the park. The picnic facilities are available to large groups with a reservation and unreserved tables and shelters are available on a first come-first served basis.

Activin type 2 receptors

The Activin type 2 receptors modulate signals for ligands belonging to the Transforming growth factor beta superfamily of ligands. These include: Activin (or Inhibin), Bone morphogenetic proteins and Nodal. They are involved in a host of physiological processes including, growth, cell differentiation, homeostasis, osteogenesis, apoptosis and many other functions. There are two Activin type two receptors: ACVR2A and ACVR2B.
Despite the large amount of processes that these ligands regulate, they all operate through essentially the same pathway: A ligand binds to a Type two receptor, which recruits and trans-phosphorylates a type I receptor. The type I receptor recruits a receptor regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) which it phosphorylates. The RSMAD then translocates to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor.
Function.
Several ligands that signal through the Activin type II receptors regulate muscle growth. Myostatin, a TGF-beta superfamily member, is a negative regulator of muscle growth. Myostatin binds to ACVR2B and to a lesser extent ACVR2A. In mice that were ACVR2A -/- (null) mutants there was an increase in all four muscle groups studied (pectoralis, triceps, quadriceps, and gastrocnemious/plantaris muscles). Two of these muscle groups (pectoralis and triceps) were increased in ACVR2B -/- (null) mutants. 
Activin plays a significant role in reproduction. ACVR2 receptors are present in the testis during testicular development. ACR2A and ACVR2B was found to be localized primarily in the gonocytes as well as in sertoli cells. These cells are responsive to both autocrine and paracrine Activin B signaling, which controls their proliferation. Cells of the epididymis also have ACVR2A receptors present. ACVR2B receptors were found to be localized in the rete testis.
Clinical significance.
The ACVR2 gene is often found inactivated in prostate cancer and tumors with microsatellite instability.
In the lab, it has been shown that truncated mutations in the ACVR2 gene causes a significant reduction in activin mediated cell signaling. In 58.1% of microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) colorectal cancers the ACVR2A gene has been found mutated. It also plays a role in non-MSI-H colorectal cancers.

Saskatoon Police Service

Saskatoon Police Service (SPS) is the municipal police service in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada and holds both municipal and provincial jurisdiction. Police Chief Clive Weighill is the head of the service. The deputy chiefs are Deputy Chief Mark Chatterbok (Administration), and Deputy Chief Bernie Pannell (Operations). The SPS operates in partnership and cooperation with the Corman Park Police Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
History.
In 1882 the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) established a detachment in Saskatoon. In 1889, Constable Clisby of the NWMP was established as Saskatoon's first permanent police officer.
In 1903 Robert E. Dunning was made the first Chief of Police in the City of Saskatoon. In 1910 the first Rules and Regulations of the Saskatoon Police Department were approved.
In 1977 a new police station was opened on the spot of the old station which was demolished, which was transitioned to a parking lot. An abandoned tunnel still exists underground stretching from the parking lot, across 23rd street to the old post office. The new building cost roughly $5.5 million (1977) and has a floor space of 101,000 feet squared.
In 2010 The city of Saskatoon drew plans to extend 25th street to Idylwyld Drive and this is to be the location for the new police station. Construction began 2011 and was completed in July 2014. The transition to the new building officially took place on July 22, 2014. The complete project cost $122 million (2014) and should serve as the central headquarters for up to 50 years.
International police peacekeeping operations.
With struggling police forces worldwide there is a need for trained police officers to help training these forces. During 2009 and 2010 Constable Andrew Johnstone went to Afghanistan to train their police, and Sergeant Pat Barbar in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Other members of the SPS have worked in other countries for other UN operations, such as Sergeant Darcel Pittman and former Deputy Chief Keith Atkinson in Kosovo in 2000.
They play widely varying roles within each mission, from patrolling streets and training police recruits to providing humanitarian assistance, ensuring security for elections and investigating human rights violations.
Departments.
Departments and special departments.
Structure.
As of 2012 the SPS has 510 sworn officers, and 134 civilian positions. The ranks are as follows:
Inquiries.
Accusations against the Saskatoon Police Service have resulted in public inquiries. One such inquiry is presently taking place (as of July 2006) and involves the investigation into the murder of a nursing student in Saskatoon in 1969. David Milgaard was convicted of this murder but was later cleared of this charge through DNA evidence which was unavailable at the time of his trial.

Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base

Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base (1954–1969) is a former United States Air Force Strategic Air Command base located near the town of Burns Flat in Washita County, Oklahoma, 15 miles (24 km) southwest of the city of Clinton, Oklahoma.
Today it is the site of the Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark.
History.
NAS Clinton.
In 1942, at the beginning of World War II, the United States Navy established a naval air station on 5,000 acres (20 km²) of farmland in the area known as Burns Flat. The site was named Naval Air Station Clinton and was acquired by condemnation. Four runways and numerous installation support facilities were built. The mission of NAS Clinton was to train naval aviators.
After the war ended, NAS Clinton was closed in June 1946, but for a period of time was used as a "graveyard" for thousands of naval aircraft from the war. Some of these planes were sold to individuals or companies, but most were dismantled and melted and sold as scrap. A portion of the airfield was leased by Sherman Iron Works for use in salvaging surplus combat aircraft and parts.
On 27 January 1949, the United States of America (acting by and through the War Assets Administration) conveyed the installation to the City of Clinton, Oklahoma by quitclaim deed. The deed contained a recapture clause for national emergency purposes. After the transfer the installation was used for a time as a civilian airport.
Clinton-Sherman AFB.
On 29 June 1954, the Eighth Naval District Public Works and Dock Office in New Orleans, Louisiana was designated as the engineering agency for the United States Air Force for the purpose of rehabilitating buildings on the former NAS Clinton facility, and transition of the facility into an active Air Force base supporting the Strategic Air Command (SAC).
On 15 September 1954, the United States of America leased the site from the City of Clinton to be used as an United States Air Force Base. The site consisted of of land in fee and of easements.
On 15 March 1955 the formal transfer of the base was made to the USAF. The facility was renamed Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base, with the name being derived from the nearby city of Clinton, Oklahoma and the Sherman Iron Works. The Air Force modernized the old World War II naval air station with many new buildings, as well as constructing a main runway to support Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers.
The first tenant occupied the new base on 10 December 1957 when the Strategic Air Command activated the 4123rd Strategic Wing (4123 SW) to perform B-52 pilot training and development of aircraft equipment. It continued this mission until 15 November 1962 when the wing was inactivated. The 98th Bombardment Squadron (1959–63) operated B-52E Stratofortress aircraft on operationally-ready status while assigned to the 4123 SW.
The 4123 SW was replaced by the 70th Bombardment Wing, Heavy which absorbed the personnel and equipment of the training wing. The 70 BW was placed on operational status upon activation with the 61st and 98th Bombardment Squadrons being its operational flying squadrons. On 1 February 1963, the 98 BS was inactivated with its personnel and equipment being transferred to the newly established 6th Bombardment Squadron.
Initially equipped with B-52E models, the 70 BW was upgraded to the B-52D in 1968 along with some older B-52Cs which had limited use. It conducted strategic bombardment training and air refueling missions from February 1963 to December 1969.
In addition to the training missions (Matagorda Island Test Bomb-sight, Torrejon Spain, etc.), the 70th BW maintained a 24-hour watch "Christmas Tree" of eight nuclear-loaded B-52s (each with two additional 'Hound Dog' standoff nuclear missiles), and an "Alert Barracks" manned by full 24-hour mission crews adjacent to the Christmas Tree. (The Christmas-Tree area is clearly shown at the north end of the main runway in the aerial photo of the runway.) The 70th BW additionally took part in the "Polar Route" missions (Curtis LeMay's constant armed B-52s in the air) in rotation with other SAC bases.
In addition to the SAC 70th BW mission, Clinton-Sherman acted as (1) a refueling and layover point for cross-country USAF and Naval aircraft (mainly fighter aircraft of all sorts); (2) as a flight training destination for US Army helicopters from Fort Sill and fighter trainers from Vance AFB; and (3) as a diversion landing field when Tinker AFB was locked in by weather or traffic considerations.
Preceding 2 paragraphs from a member of the Clinton-Sherman 'Base Ops' crew (we called in all aircraft flight plans), from mid-'63 to May'64.
For several months in both 1968 and 1969, all of the 70 BW aircraft, most of the aircrew and maintenance personnel and some of its support people were loaned to other SAC units engaged in combat operations in the Far East and Southeast Asia. It was one of eleven SAC bomb wings that rotated such combat duty under the program known as Arc Light.
In 1969, military operations were de-emphasized and Clinton-Sherman AFB was designated for closure. Due to budgetary restrictions, the 70th Bombardment Wing was inactivated on 31 December 1969 and the USAF closed Clinton-Sherman AFB.
Post USAF Closure use.
On 1 June 1971, the City of Clinton conveyed by Quitclaim deed to the General Services Administration (GSA). On 3 June 1971, the United States of America and the City of Clinton, Oklahoma, by mutual agreement, terminated the lease dated 15 September 1954.
On 1 July 1971, the City of Clinton, Oklahoma, granted Midwestern Oklahoma Development Authority (MODA) a leasehold interest for a portion of the site, with said lease containing provisions for sub-leasing property. On 16 August 1972, MODA leased to the United States of America a portion of the former Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base.
On 28 February 1975, the lease between MODA and the United States of America was terminated, with the United States retaining the right to reenter and use part of the land and improvements in the event of a national emergency. On 6 October 1989, the leasehold interest between MODA and the City of Clinton was terminated
Today the site continues as the Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark and the runway is one of the longest in the world. The runway is used daily for private non-commercial aircraft.
In addition, the runway at Clinton-Sherman is routinely used for training purposes by USAF and USN aircraft at nearby bases. This includes Lockheed C-5A/B Galaxy, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, and Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers from Altus AFB; Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS, KC-135, and U.S. Navy E-6 Mercury TACAMO aircraft from Tinker AFB; Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons from Tulsa Air National Guard Base; and Raytheon T-1 Jayhawks and Northrup T-38 Talons from Vance AFB. The U.S. Air Force has also used the Clinton-Sherman site for training exercises such as "Mighty Force" and other exercises with personnel from Altus AFB or Tinker AFB.
Oklahoma Highway Patrol.
The former northeast 'alert pads' and ready facility of the former SAC base curerntly houses the Law Enforcement Driver Training Center of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol; Oklahoma Department of Public Safety. Currently referred to as 'Building 120', the former bunker facility houses OHP Academy staff and cadets during the driving training portion of 'Patrol Schools'. The annual 'Cadet Lawman Academy' (sponsored by the OSTA, Elks Lodge, and C.U.D.D.), is also located at the same facility during the summer, which provides a 1 week program for high school students. The surrounding facility and tarmac incorporates over 12 miles of various roadways and courses, used for precision driving and emergency vehicle operation training. This facility is recognized as one of the top ranked law enforcement driver training centers in the country, according to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
The location of the former naval air station World War II runways to the north and west of the main runway are still visible on aerial photographs of the airport; however they are not usable.

<doc id="5902060" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902060" title="Directionality (molecular biology)">
Directionality (molecular biology)

Directionality, in molecular biology and biochemistry, is the end-to-end chemical orientation of a single strand of nucleic acid. The chemical convention of naming carbon atoms in the nucleotide sugar-ring numerically gives rise to a 5′-end and a 3′-end (usually pronounced "five prime end" and "three prime end"). The relative positions of structures along a strand of nucleic acid, including genes and various protein binding sites, are usually noted as being either "upstream" (towards the 5′-end) or "downstream" (towards the 3′-end). (See also upstream and downstream.)
This naming convention is important because nucleic acids can only be synthesized in vivo in the 5′-to-3′ direction, as the polymerase that assembles new strands only attaches new nucleotides to the 3′-hydroxyl (-OH) group, via a phosphodiester bond. Directionality is related to, but independent from sense. In coding DNA, codons read 5′–ATG–⋯–3′ on the sense strand, and 3′–TAC–⋯–5′ on the complementary antisense strand. Thus only the "antisense" strand will be transcribed to sense (5′–AUG–⋯–3′) mRNA. By convention, single strands of DNA and RNA sequences are written in 5′-to-3′ direction.
5′-end.
The 5′-end (pronounced "five prime end") designates the end of the DNA or RNA strand that has the fifth carbon in the sugar-ring of the deoxyribose or ribose at its terminus. A phosphate group attached to the 5′-end permits ligation of two nucleotides, i.e., the covalent binding of a 5′-phosphate to the 3′-hydroxyl group of another nucleotide, to form a phosphodiester bond. Removal of the 5′-phosphate prevents ligation. To prevent unwanted nucleic acid ligation (e.g. self-ligation of a plasmid vector in DNA cloning), molecular biologists commonly remove the 5′-phosphate with a phosphatase.
The 5′-end of nascent messenger RNA is the site at which post-transcriptional capping occurs, a process which is vital to producing mature messenger RNA. Capping increases the stability of the messenger RNA while it undergoes translation, providing resistance to the degradative effects of exonucleases. It consists of a methylated nucleotide (methylguanosine) attached to the messenger RNA in a rare 5′- to 5′-triphosphate linkage.
The 5′-"flanking" region of a gene often denotes a region of DNA which is not transcribed into RNA. The 5′-flanking region contains the gene promoter, and may also contain enhancers or other protein binding sites.
The 5′-"untranslated" region (5′-UTR) is a region of a gene which is transcribed into mRNA, and is located at the 5′-end of the mRNA. This region of an mRNA may or may not be translated, but is usually involved in the regulation of translation. The 5′-untranslated region is the portion of the DNA starting from the cap site and extending to the base just before the AUG translation initiation codon of the main coding sequence. This region may have sequences, such as the ribosome binding site and Kozak sequence, which determine the translation efficiency of the mRNA, or which may affect the stability of the mRNA.
3′-end.
The 3′-end of a strand is so named due to it terminating at the hydroxyl group of the third carbon in the sugar-ring, and is known as the "tail end". The 3′-hydroxyl is necessary in the synthesis of new nucleic acid molecules as it is ligated (joined) to the 5′-phosphate of a separate nucleotide, allowing the formation of strands of linked nucleotides. 
Molecular biologists can use nucleotides that lack a 3′-hydroxyl (dideoxyribonucleotides) to interrupt the replication of DNA. This technique is known as the dideoxy chain-termination termination method or the Sanger method, and is used to determine the order of nucleotides in DNA.
The 3′-end of nascent messenger RNA is the site of post-transcriptional polyadenylation, which attaches a chain of 50 to 250 adenosine residues to produce mature messenger RNA. This chain helps in determining how long the messenger RNA lasts in the cell, influencing how much protein is produced from it.
The 3′-"flanking" region is a region of DNA that is not copied into the mature mRNA, but which is present adjacent to 3′-end of the gene. It was originally thought that the 3′-flanking DNA was not transcribed at all, but it was discovered to be transcribed into RNA and quickly removed during processing of the primary transcript to form the mature mRNA. The 3′-flanking region often contains sequences that affect the formation of the 3′-end of the message. It may also contain enhancers or other sites to which proteins may bind.
The 3′-"untranslated" region (3′-UTR) is a region of the DNA which "is" transcribed into mRNA and becomes the 3′-end of the message, but which does not contain protein coding sequence. Everything between the stop codon and the polyA tail is considered to be 3′-untranslated. The 3′-untranslated region may affect the translation efficiency of the mRNA or the stability of the mRNA. It also has sequences which are required for the addition of the poly(A) tail to the message, including the hexanucleotide AAUAAA.

<doc id="5902061" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902061" title="Outcrossing">
Outcrossing

Outcrossing or outbreeding is the practice of introducing unrelated genetic material into a breeding line. It increases genetic diversity, thus reducing the probability of an individual being subject to disease or reducing genetic abnormalities. It is also known as a Patrilineal system.
It is used in line-breeding to restore vigor or size and fertility to a breeding line. "Linebreeding" is where animals carry a common ancestor in their pedigrees and are bred together, should be considered distinct from the term "inbreeding" which is the production of offspring by parents more closely related than the average.
Outcrossing is now the norm of most purposeful breeding, contrary to what is commonly believed.
The outcrossing breeder intends to remove the traits by using "new blood". With dominant traits, one can still see the expression of the traits and can remove those traits whether one outcrosses, line breeds or inbreds. With recessives, outcrossing allows for the recessive traits to migrate across a population. The outcrossing breeder then may have individuals that have many deleterious genes that are expressed by placing their animals against a similarly outcrossed individual. There is now a gamut of deleterious genes within each individual in many breeds. On the other hand, increasing the variance of genes or alleles within the gene pool may protect against extinction by stressors from the environment. For example, in this context, a recent veterinary medicine study tried to determine the genetic diversity within cat breeds.
Outcrossing is believed to be the "norm" in the wild. However, this is not necessarily logical since migration may only occur through necessity. Feral cats, for example are one of the most inbred as individuals remain nearby their original homes, unless environmental stresses drive them to migration.
Breeders inbreed within their genetic pool, attempting to maintain desirable traits and to cull those traits that are undesirable. When undesirable traits begin to appear, mates are selected to determine if a trait is recessive or dominant. Removal is accomplished by breeding two individuals of known genetic status, usually they are related.
In nature, where breeding is not managed, outcrossing rates may be estimated by genetic analysis, by employing mathematical models of mating systems such as the mixed mating model or the effective selfing model. This allows calculation of the amount of genetic exchange between populations, and thus provides insights into the biogeography and phytogeography of species.
Gregor Mendel used outcrossing in his experiments with flowers for his breeding stock. He then used the resulting offspring to chart inheritance patterns, using the crossing of siblings, and backcrossing to parents to determine how inheritance functioned.

In 1991, he was the first rookie to start for the Cardinals in left field since Hall of Famer Red Schoendienst.
In 1992, Gilkey hit .302 in 131 games with the Cardinals. Gilkey would bat over .300 twice more during his career.
During the offseason in January 1996, Gilkey was traded by the Cardinals to the Mets. Gilkey arguably had his strongest season in 1996. His .317 average was eighth in the National League, while his 44 doubles ranked fourth (and also set a Mets single season record). Gilkey finished fourteenth in National League MVP voting that year. Gilkey and center fielder Lance Johnson formed a formidable offensive one-two punch as outfielders in their first year with the Mets. Gilkey led the league with 18 outfield assists from that year -- one of six double-digit assist years in his career with his career high being 19 outfield assists in 1993 when tied for the league lead.
Gilkey statistics dropped off substantially the next year. His batting average fell to .249. In 1998, Gilkey was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Gilkey offensive numbers were less impressive in the latter years of his career and his playing time declined, although he did rebound to hit .294 in 1999. He was released by the Diamondbacks in the middle of the 2000 season and signed with the Red Sox as a free agent. Gilkey made the playoffs as a Diamondback in 1999 and in 2001 as a Brave. Gilkey's career ended after the 2001 season.
Film career.
Gilkey had a small role in the 1997 film Men in Black. The climax of the film took place in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in New York City near Shea Stadium, home of the Mets. Gilkey appeared in his real life role as a Mets outfielder. Gilkey was distracted by a massive spacecraft above Shea Stadium (actually one of the two circular observation towers from the 1964 World's Fair) and was hit on the head by a fly ball.

Amos Alonzo Stagg High School

Amos Alonzo Stagg High School, Stagg, or AAS, is a public four-year high school located at the intersection of S. Roberts Rd. and W. 111th Street in Palos Hills, Illinois, a southwest suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is part of Consolidated High School District 230, which also includes Victor J. Andrew High School and Carl Sandburg High School.
History.
In the spring of 1962, voters in Consolidated High School district 230 approved a US$2.1 million bond issue to construct the district's second high school, which was projected to have an initial student population of 1,200.
The school district chose to name the school for former University of Chicago football coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. Stagg was chosen "in recognition of his century of devotion to young men to help them understand the powers they possess". The original building contained 16 classrooms, a gymnasium capable of seating 1,600, a band and choral room, a cafeteria and small theater, 7 laboratories, and 3 industrial arts rooms.
The general design saw the school built as three separate buildings, connected by glass corridors.
Like its sister school, Carl Sandburg, Stagg High School was designed specifically to be expanded in future years. The fall 1966 enrollment saw the school reach its capacity, a few months after the first expansion plans were revealed, calling for a swimming pool and more room for art and industrial education, among other additions.
Academics.
In 2008, Stagg had an average composite ACT score of 21.6 and graduated 96.2% of its senior class. The average class size is 22.4. Stagg has made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, the test used in Illinois to fulfill the federal No Child Left Behind Act.
Student life.
Activities.
The school sponsors over 45 clubs and activities for students, ranging from athletic and fine arts to leadership and special interest. Among the student groups which are local chapters of national organizations are: Key Club, National Honor Society, Relay for Life, and Operation Snowball.
The Individual events team finished second in the IHSA state championship tournament in 1986.
The Amos Alonzo Stagg Marching Chargers, Stagg's largest competitive extracurricular activity. Following a two-week band camp program, the marching band enters a fall season of contests and often tri-weekly rehearsals for the duration of the season. They participate in roughly 4-6 marching competitions each year across the state of Illinois, including an exhibition performance at their home competition, the Stagg Marching Band Jamboree (annual since 1979). The Marching Chargers generally end their yearly seasons by participating in the Illinois State University Invitational Marching Band Championships or the University of Illinois Illini Marching Festival.
Athletics.
Stagg competes in the Southwest Suburban Conference (SWSC), and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most interscholastic high school sports and competitive activities in the state of Illinois. Teams are stylized as the Chargers.
The school sponsors interscholastic sports teams for young men and women in basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and water polo. Young men may compete in baseball, football, and wrestling, while young women may compete in badminton, cheerleading, and softball. While not sponsored by the IHSA, the school also sponsors a competitive poms team.
The following teams have placed in the top four of their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournament or meet:

Ridley's Family Markets

Ridley's Family Markets is a family-owned chain of grocery stores based in Jerome, Idaho. It was founded in 1984 in Payson, Utah. As of 2014 Ridley's operates 24 supermarkets in Idaho, northern Utah, Nevada, and Wyoming. 
As of 2013 it was ranked as the 22nd largest private company in Idaho.
History.
In 1984, Jerry and Connie Ridley opened a grocery store in Payson, Utah. Ridley's first operated as an IGA franchise called Ridley's IGA Foodliner. Two years later, the couple sold the Payson store and begin a partnership to build and operate a Food 4 Less store in Provo, Utah. In 1988, after grocery retailer Farmer Jack closed their short-lived stores in Idaho and Utah, the Ridleys decided to sell their share of the Food 4 Less store to acquire three former Farmer Jack stores in Idaho. Ridley's Food Corporation was incorporated that same year as a privately held company. Throughout the 1990s, Ridley's began acquire several grocery stores in Idaho including two Smith's Food and Drug stores in Boise (1992) and two Sprouse-Reitz stores in Emmett and McCall (1994). Each of these four stores were eventually closed or relocated. The retailer's first stores in Nevada and Wyoming opened in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Between 2008 and 2010, Ridley's acquired three Albertsons stores in Blackfoot, Idaho and Orem, Utah. Following the purchase of three pharmacies in Idaho and Nevada, Ridley's opened the first free-standing pharmacies in the company's history in 2010. In 2013 Ridley's opened the first of a new warehouse store format called LoLo's Fresh Foods Warehouse in Provo Utah.
Since the late 1990s, Ridley's has been supplied by Associated Food Stores. The company was previously supplied by Fleming Foods.
Electronic retailing innovations.
Electronic marketing innovations that Ridley's had developed around its customer loyalty program were recognized in 2006 with a Global Electronic Marketing award. Program features recognized by the award included customizable shopping lists, card points that could be redeemed for rewards and discounts, and e-mail delivery of weekly ads. In 2008, it was announced that Ridley's would conduct an experimental implementation of electronic coupon clearing in one of its stores. This is an innovation that transfers coupon redemption information from retailers to manufacturers electronically, with the goal of eliminating the transaction costs and other problems involved with traditional methods of coupon processing. Although this technology has many perceived advantages, it had not been successfully implemented on a large scale.

<doc id="5902124" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902124" title="Pirate code">
Pirate code

A pirate code was a code of conduct invented for governing pirates, and first introduced by the 17th-century Portuguese buccaneer Bartolomeu Português. Generally each pirate crew had its own code or articles, which provided rules for discipline, division of stolen goods, and compensation for injured pirates.
Applications.
Buccaneers began operating under a set of rules variously called the Chasse-Partie, Charter Party, Custom of the Coast, or Jamaica Discipline. These eventually became known as Articles of Agreement, or the pirate's code. Pirate articles varied from one captain to another, and sometimes even from one voyage to another, but they were generally alike in including provisions for discipline, specifications for each crewmate's share of treasure, and compensation for the injured.
Each crew member was asked to sign or make his mark on the articles, then swear an oath of allegiance or honor. The oath was sometimes taken on a Bible, but John Phillips' men, lacking a Bible, swore on an axe. Legend suggests that other pirates swore on crossed pistols, swords, or on a human skull, or astride a cannon. This act formally inducted the signer into the pirate crew, generally entitling him to vote for officers and on other "affairs of moment," to bear arms, and to his share of the plunder. The articles having been signed, they were then posted in a prominent place, often the door of the grand cabin.
After a piratical cruise began, new recruits from captured ships would sometimes sign the articles, in some cases voluntarily, in other cases under threat of torture or death. Valuable sea artisans, such as carpenters and navigators, were especially likely to be forced to sign articles under duress, and would rarely be released regardless of their decision to sign or not. In some cases, even willing recruits would ask the pirates to pretend to force them to sign, so that they could plead they were forced should they ever be captured by the law. Generally, men who had not signed the articles had a much better chance of acquittal at trial if captured by the law.
Pirate articles are closely related to, and in some cases derived from, privateering articles, which similarly provided for discipline and regulated distribution of booty (though usually far less equally than with pirate articles). By the 19th century, ordinary merchant ships also had articles specifying wages and rules, which crewmen had to sign upon shipping aboard. Merchant articles and privateering articles can be traced back to Europe in the Middle Ages when there was a system of 'joint hands' agreements between merchants, owners and seamen to share profits.
Example codes.
Four complete or nearly complete sets of piratical articles have survived, chiefly from Charles Johnson's "A General History of the Pyrates", first published in 1724. A partial code from Henry Morgan is preserved in Alexandre Exquemelin's 1678 book "The Buccaneers of America". Many other pirates are known to have had articles. Few pirate articles have survived, because pirates on the verge of capture or surrender usually burned their articles or threw them overboard, to prevent the papers being used against them at trial.
Captain John Phillips's articles.
Captain John Phillips, captain of the "Revenge", also set a code for his men in 1724:
Articles of Edward Low and George Lowther.
The articles listed below are attributed by the Boston News-Letter to Captain Edward Low. The first eight of these articles are essentially identical to those attributed to pirate captain George Lowther by Charles Johnson. Since Lowther and Low are known to have sailed together from about New Year's to May 28, 1722, it is probable that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther shared the same articles, with Low's two extra articles being an "ordinance", or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated.
Articles of John Gow.
A set of articles written in John Gow's own hand was found aboard his ship, the "Revenge" (ex-"George"), in 1729. Article IV's reference to no going ashore "till the ship is off the ground" suggests that the "Revenge" was already grounded when the articles were written, only days before Gow and his men were captured. The code states as follows:
Articles of Henry Morgan and other buccaneers.
Exquemelin writes in general terms about the articles of late 17th century Caribbean buccaneers. Although he does not attribute these articles to any specific buccaneer captain, Exquemelin almost certainly sailed with Henry Morgan as a physician, and thus his account likely reflects Morgan's articles more accurately than any other privateer or buccaneer of the time.
Exquemelin writes that the buccaneers "agree on certain articles, which are put in writing, by way of bond or obligation, which every one is bound to observe, and all of them, or the chief, set their hands to it." Although Exquemelin does not number the articles, the following approximately reflects his description of the buccaneers' laws:

Edmund Conen

Edmund Conen (10 November 1914 – 5 March 1990) was a German football player. He was born in Ürzig, Germany.
Conen played with 1. FC Saarbrücken, Stuttgarter Kickers, Mülhausen 93, HSV Groß Born (Pommern) and a couple of smaller clubs. In 1934, he was approached by Werder Bremen but, instead of joining them, told the DFB that Werder were dishing out financial offers to players. At that time football was still strictly amateur in Germany (officially) and payments to players were not permitted. The affair ended in the club and some of their officials, players and the team manager being fined and suspended. 
With four goals in the 1934 FIFA World Cup in Italy, Conen had been the joint second top scorer with Angelo Schiavio of Italy, behind Oldřich Nejedlý of Czechoslovakia who has 6 goals.
He played from 1934 to 1942 in 28 international matches for Germany and scored 27 goals.
Just 19, Germany youngster Conen made quite an impact at the second FIFA World Cup with his three goals in his first match of the tournament against Belgium on 27 May. The game was tied at 2–2 before the powerful forward netted three times in the final 17 minutes to hand the Germans a 5–2 win in Florence, Italy. This achievement could only be equalized by Gerd Müller in 1970 against Peru. He managed to hit the winner when the Germans took the bronze medal with a 3–2 win in the play-off for third place against Austria.
Two years later as a 21-year-old, Conen's career was halted due to illness. This kept him away from football for three and a half years. Conen was courageous and battled through to return to the national team on 25 June 1939. On this date in Copenhagen against Denmark Conen made the perfect comeback, with a goal in the 2:0 victory. During World War II in 1942, he played his last international match. The German national team won this final match 5:3 Budapest against Hungary. Conen and a young Fritz Walter were on fire for Sepp Herberger's crew.
After end of war Conen worked as a coach, in the middle of the 1950s, with Eintracht Braunschweig in the North and Wuppertaler SV in the West. He later coached Bayer Leverkusen, SV Schlebusch and BV Opladen. Conen died in the spring of 1990 in Leverkusen, only months before West Germany were to win their 3rd World Cup championship.

Thirikatukam(Tamil: திரிகடுகம்) is a Tamil poetic work of didactic nature belonging to the "Pathinenkilkanakku" anthology of Tamil literature. This belongs to the 'post Sangam period' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. "Thirikatukam" contains 100 poems written by the poet Nallathanaar. The poems of "Thirikatukam" are written in the Venpa meter.
"Thirikatukam" uses the analogy of the traditional herbal medicine, which uses the three herbs "sukku" (dried ginger), "milaku" (pepper) and "thippili" (Long pepper) to cure maladies of the stomach. "Thirikatugam" similarly uses three different maxims to illustrate correct behaviour.

<doc id="5902168" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902168" title="Elasticity of substitution">
Elasticity of substitution

Elasticity of substitution is the elasticity of the ratio of two inputs to a production (or utility) function with respect to the ratio of their marginal products (or utilities). It measures the curvature of an isoquant and thus, the substitutability between inputs (or goods), i.e. how easy it is to substitute one input (or good) for the other.
Mathematical definition.
Let the utility over consumption be given by formula_1. Then the elasticity of substitution is:
where formula_3 is the marginal rate of substitution. The last equality presents formula_4 which is a relationship from the first order condition for a consumer utility maximization problem. Intuitively we are looking at how a consumer's relative choices over consumption items change as their relative prices change.
Note also that formula_5:
An equivalent characterization of the elasticity of substitution is:
In discrete-time models, the elasticity of substitution of consumption in periods formula_8 and formula_9 is known as elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
Similarly, if the production function is formula_10 then the elasticity of substitution is:
where formula_12 is the marginal rate of technical substitution.
The inverse of elasticity of substitution is elasticity of complementarity.
Example.
Consider Cobb–Douglas production function formula_13.
The marginal rate of technical substitution is
It is convenient to change the notations. Denote
Rewriting this we have
Then the elasticity of substitution is
Economic interpretation.
Given an original allocation/combination and a specific substitution on allocation/combination for the original one, the larger the magnitude of the elasticity of substitution (the marginal rate of substitution elasticity of the relative allocation) means the more likely to substitute. There are always 2 sides to the market; here we are talking about the receiver, since the elasticity of preference is that of the receiver.
The elasticity of substitution also governs how the relative expenditure on goods or factor inputs changes as relative prices change. Let formula_18 denote expenditure on formula_19 relative to that on formula_20. That is:
As the relative price formula_22 changes, relative expenditure changes according to:
Thus, whether or not an increase in the relative price of formula_19 leads to an increase or decrease in the relative "expenditure" on formula_19 depends on whether the elasticity of substitution is less than or greater than one.
Intuitively, the direct effect of a rise in the relative price of formula_19 is to increase expenditure on formula_19, since a given quantity of formula_19 is more costly. On the other hand, assuming the goods in question are not Giffen goods, a rise in the relative price of formula_19 leads to a fall in relative demand for formula_19, so that the quantity of formula_19 purchased falls, which reduces expenditure on formula_19.
Which of these effects dominates depends on the magnitude of the elasticity of substitution. When the elasticity of substitution is less than one, the first effect dominates: relative demand for formula_19 falls, but by proportionally less than the rise in its relative price, so that relative expenditure rises. In this case, the goods are gross complements.
Conversely, when the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, the second effect dominates: the reduction in relative quantity exceeds the increase in relative price, so that relative expenditure on formula_19 falls. In this case, the goods are gross substitutes.
Note that when the elasticity of substitution is exactly one (as in the Cobb–Douglas case), expenditure on formula_19 relative to formula_20 is independent of the relative prices.

<doc id="5902184" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902184" title="Fully automatic time">
Fully automatic time

Fully automatic time (abbreviated FAT) is a form of race timing in which the clock is automatically activated by the starting device, and the finish time is either automatically recorded, or timed by analysis of a photo finish. The system is commonly used in track and field as well as horse racing, dog racing, bicycle racing, rowing and auto racing. In these fields a photo finish is used. It is also used in competitive swimming, for which the swimmers themselves record a finish time by touching a touchpad at the end of a race. In order to verify the equipment, or in case of failure, a backup system (typically manual) is usually used in addition to FAT.
Technology.
In races started by a starting gun, a sensor is typically attached to the gun which sends an electronic signal to the timing system when fired. Alternatively, a starting light or sound which is electronically triggered (such as a horn), the system is typically also wired to the timing system. In sports that involve a finish line that is crossed (rather than a touch finish, as in swimming), the current finishing system is a photo finish which is then analysed by judges.
Line-Scan Cameras.
The current photo-finish system used in Olympic competition, as well as other top-level events uses a digital line-scan camera aimed straight along the finish line. TimeTronics, FinishLynx and Omega are examples of commercial timing systems commonly used in athletic competitions. These cameras have an image field only a few pixels wide, with a single frame forming a narrow image only of the finish line, and anything which is crossing it. During a race, the camera takes images at an extremely high frame rate (the exact rate depends on the system, but can be in the thousands of lines per second). Computer software then arranges these frames horizontally to form a panoramic image which effectively displays a graph of the finish line (and anything crossing it) as time passes, with time denoted on the horizontal axis.
Before the advent of digital photography, (and still available as an alternative), a similar film-based system was used, consisting of a slit which a strip of film is advanced past at a constant rate to produce a similar panoramic image to the digital system. A flashing LED embedded the time calibration to the film.
Full-Frame Cameras.
Recently, there have been significant advances in full-frame video timing which utilizes a full sensor array rather than a single line. This has followed from the advent of low-cost machine vision technologies which has made possible systems that surpass 1/100 second time resolution. Previously, the NTSC television standard limited most VHS and SVHS, and digital frame rates to 59.94 frames per second (limiting the timing resolution to .016 seconds). Many modern systems, such as those manufactured by FlashTiming, are capable of frame rates of 120 frames per second at higher spatial resolution and in a purely digital regime. The addition of computer based analysis tools has greatly simplified and made efficient the process of timing races, as well as automated some portions of timing labor such with features such as motion detection and bookmarking of finish times. Due to these developments and the lower cost compared with line-scan systems, video timing has seen some limited level of adoption at a few high-school and collegiate events. The inability of these systems to perform what is known as a "zero control test" means that they do not comply with the requirements of the IAAF or other national governing bodies to be classified as Fully Automatic Timing (FAT).
Other timing systems.
There are also similar timing systems that use the simple process of breaking a beam of light. While such systems are frequently used to provide instant results (for the media), the object they are timing is more difficult to define.
Use in athletics.
According to the IAAF, any record in athletics (world, Olympic, or national) or qualifying time for Olympic Games or World Championships set in a sprint event must be timed by a FAT system to be valid.
Hand times, those with humans operating the stopping and/or starting mechanisms are highly prone to error. By rule, they are only accurate to a tenth (.1) of a second, all 100ths of a second beyond zero must be rounded to the next highest tenth.
Many track and field statisticians use a conversion factor estimate of 0.24 seconds added to any hand-timed mark in the 100 m or 200 m event, and 0.14 seconds to any hand-timed mark in the 400 m or longer event. These conversion factors are only applicable for comparing marks from a variety of sources, but are not acceptable for Record purposes. In the case of comparing an adjusted manual time to FAT timing, an original FAT time being equivalent, the FAT time will be considered more accurate, and thus the athlete will be given the higher seed, or comparison ranking. This old method of converting times dates back to when FAT systems were much less common. They are increasingly less acceptable even at low level meets and certainly not at the upper level of the sport.
Fully automatic timing did not become mandatory for world records until 1 January 1977.
The first known time with an auto timing device in the Olympic Games was in the steeplechase in 1928, won by Loukola in 9:21.60 (9:21 4/5 official hand time) . The device used was the Löbner camera-timer.
In 1932 three systems were used - official hand timing, hand started photo-finish times, and the Gustavus Town Kirby timing device, which was designed by Kirby to determine the correct order of finish in horse races. The official report for 1932 Olympics states: "In addition to hand timing, two auxiliary electrical timing devices were used. Both were started by an attachment to the starters gun. One was stopped by hand at the time the runners hit the tape. The other was provided with a motion picture camera which photographed the runner at the tape and the dial of the time indicator 
simultaneously."
In 1936 FAT was used but very few times have been found.
In 1948 Bulova began developing the Phototimer, a unique combination of photo-finish camera and precision electronic timing instrument. The Phototimer was the first automatic timing device to be used in competitive sports. It was used extensively in North America, including at the 1948 US Olympic trials. The Bulova device was activated by the sound of the starting gun firing, rather than by a direct connection, which means that the times were around 0.02 seconds faster than reality. The 1948 Olympics, however, continued to use Omega timing with a device called the 'Magic Eye', developed by British Race Finish Recording Co. Ltd. The automatic times produced in the 1948 Olympics have never been released, but examination of the photos at the finish means that margins have been calculated to 1/100 second accuracy.
In 1952 the Omega Time Recorder was the first to use a quartz clock and print out results, earning the company a prestigious Cross of Merit from the Olympic Committee. Clocks were added to slit cameras for automatic time-stamping, accurate to the 100th of a second. Despite these improvements, the overall system was similar to that used in London in 1948 (the Racend Omega Timer). The average difference between the FAT and manual times for the men's 100 meters was 0.24 seconds, although this ranged from 0.05 seconds to 0.45 seconds. The average difference for the six runners in the 100 meter final was 0.41 seconds, much higher than the average. (the average difference in the women's 100 meters competition was also 0.24 but only 0.22 in the final). In the men's 200 meters, the average difference was 0.21 seconds, and in the men's 400 meters the average difference was 0.16 seconds.
In 1956 the average difference between the FAT and manual times for the men's 100 meters was 0.19 seconds, ranging from -0.05 to 0.34 seconds. In the men's 200 meters, the average difference was 0.16 seconds, and in the men's 400 meters the average difference was 0.11 seconds.
In 1960 the average difference between the FAT and manual times for the men's 100 meters was 0.15 seconds, ranging from -0.05 to 0.26 seconds. In the men's 200 meters, the average difference was 0.13 seconds, and in the men's 400 meters the average difference was 0.14 seconds.
In 1964, although manual timing was also used at the Olympics, the official times were measured with a FAT system but given the appearance of hand times. For example, Bob Hayes won the 100 meters in a FAT time of 10.06 seconds, which was converted to an official time of 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that officials with stopwatches had timed Hayes at 9.9 seconds. The FAT systems in 1964 and 1968 built in a 0.05 second delay, so Hayes' FAT time was measured as 10.01 seconds, which was rounded to 10.0 seconds for official purposes. The currently understood time of 10.06 has been determined by adding back the 0.05 seconds delay.
The same adjustment has been made to the 1968 Olympics FAT times. Hines' winning time for the 100 meters was measured as 9.89 seconds, subsequently adjusted to 9.95 seconds.
In 1972, having provided the official timing equipment since 1932, Omega lost the right to be the official timer for the Olympics to Longines. Omega returned for the 1976 Olympics. This was the first Olympics where official results were given to the nearest 1/100 seconds.

Privileged motion

__NOTOC__
A privileged motion is a motion in parliamentary procedure that is granted precedence over ordinary business because it concerns matters of great importance or urgency. Such motions are not debatable, although in case of questions of privilege, the chair may feel the need to elicit relevant facts from members.
Explanation.
Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR).
According to Robert's Rules of Order, the privileged motions are, in order of precedence:
The Standard Code (TSC).
"The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure" omits motion number 1 listed above, instead providing that the motion to adjourn may be amended with regard to the time to which to adjourn; and also omits motion number 5, on the grounds that any member may raise a point of order if the scheduled order of business is not being followed.
Legislative use.
Privileged motions in the Indian Parliament.
A member of Indian legislatures—either the federal Parliament of India or the Vidhan Sabha and Vidhan Parishad in the states and territories—may raise a question involving a breach of privilege either of a member or of the Council or of a Committee with the consent of the Chairman.

Curt Gowdy State Park

Curt Gowdy State Park is a state park in Albany and Laramie Counties, Wyoming, USA,
halfway between Cheyenne and Laramie on Wyoming Highway 210. It was established in 1971 and later named in March 1972 for sportscaster Curt Gowdy (1919–2006). It is part of the Laramie Mountains and in size. It is divided into seven sections. There are three reservoirs: Granite Springs, Crystal, and North Crow. Granite is the largest and Crystal the smallest. Available activities include boating, canoeing, water skiing, fishing, camping, rockhounding, archery, hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking. The terrain consists primarily of hills with sharp granite outcroppings. Wildlife that can be found include: kokanee salmon, perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, lake trout, white-tailed deer, and mule deer. Many birds and flowers are found. Accommodation is available at Hynds Lodge, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. 
Wyoming State Parks, Historic Sites & Trails began an International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA) trail improvement project in early 2006. IMBA later designated the park an "Epic" trail system. The park, in common with most of Wyoming's state parks, is a reservoir park, which tends to limit aquatic activities such as boating, fishing, and swimming. In 2009 Wyoming began a program to build additional hiking trails in several Wyoming state parks. Curt Gowdy State Park served as the pilot project for this program, with 32 miles of additional trails. The state requires that the newly built trails do not fundamentally alter the landscape of the park. Funding for the trails comes from several federal and state funds and private donations.

Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa

Ma Waraa Al Tabiaa () ("The Paranormal") is the title of a series of horror/thriller novels written by Ahmad Khaled Towfeq. As of November 2013, 79 novels were published.
Storyline.
The stories are narratives, told in a first person view, where Ref'att is currently nearing seventy, and is telling tales about his adventures starting when he was in his late thirties and up. All of the events are related to the metaphysics in a way or another, and most often are caused by supernatural phenomena, although some are caused by culprits who are faking the events. Refaat usually solves the mystery, and always gets out alive whether or not he has fully understood the phenomenon. He is accompanied by many friends and characters throughout the stories, some stories are more centered around them than him, and some are totally narrated by them.
Style.
The stories are noted for the character's sarcastic attitude towards almost everything in life, although he is kind-hearted inside. He usually disbelieves everything until its proven, and rarely pretends to be smart, as he always thinks that there is nothing that he could do about problems.
The writer's style is always renewed, with more than once the story told through newspaper clippings and retellings by other characters, who are given each a distinct point of view and different telling of the story. One very good example of this is #7 ("Ostoret allahab alazrak"), "The Legend of the Blue Flame", where each character is telling a part of the story in a distinctive style. One thing relates them all, however, which is the sarcasm, a characteristic of the writer that does not change with any line of stories he writes.
Horror circles.
Each nine books, the tenth is made in a special episodic way called the horror circle. The horror circles are series of short stories narrated by different characters (exception #60, The black museum) and are related by a common motif. As of June 2007, they were:

Arneja

"Arneja"' is a Punjabi tribe in Pakistan and India.
The Arneja ancestry is of the Punjab and Sindh. In India, they reside in Punjab (India), Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Jammu, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and other parts of the country. In Pakistan, they are mainly found in Punjab (Pakistan) and Sindh. They have also spread to all parts of the world due in part to the rising communal tension resulting from the division of India into Pakistan and India. Many Arnejas of Sikh and Hindu affiliation were suddenly forced to move to India at the time of Partition in the late 1940s. Many lost land and property during the exodus and were forced into refugee camps to await their fate in a new country.
The Arneja people are generally of warrior caste and ancestry (Arora). They are a group of Indo-Aryans who remained in the Indus Valley throughout most of their history. 
Since the end of World War II, many Arnejas in India and abroad in North America and United Kingdom are educated professionals in Engineering, Medicine, Surgery and other related professions.

Hackers Wanted

Hackers Wanted is an unreleased American documentary film.
Directed and written by Sam Bozzo, the film explores the origins and nature of hackers and hacking by following the adventures of Adrian Lamo, and contrasting his story with that of controversial figures throughout history. The film is narrated by Kevin Spacey.
Originally named "Can You Hack It?" The film failed to get a conventional release, according to Lamo, because of conflicts between its producer and others on the team. The more commonly cited reason is a problem with the quality of the finished product. On May 20, 2010, a version of the film was leaked to BitTorrent. Lamo has stated that he had no involvement in the leak.
"It's ironic that a film about overcoming barriers, about new technologies, about thinking differently, had to come to the public eye by being hacked out of the hands of people who, after making a film about the free flow of information, tried to lock away that information forever. The truth tends to itself." -Adrian Lamo
On June 12, 2010, a director's cut version of the film was also leaked onto torrent sites. This version of the film contains additional footage and is significantly different from the one previously leaked.

List of The Incredibles characters

The following is a list of fictional characters from the 2004 Disney/Pixar animated film "The Incredibles" and related media.
The Parr family.
Mr. Incredible.
Robert "Bob" Parr (a.k.a. Mr. Incredible) (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) possesses tremendous strength, and heightened resistance to harm. He also has enhanced senses. He is married to Helen Parr, the superheroine known as Elastigirl, and they have three children together: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack.
Bob found forced retirement difficult, and often had to cheat his way out of the house on Wednesdays so that he could continue his superheroics. He was shocked to discover that his "Number 1 fan", Buddy Pine, had reformed himself as the villain Syndrome after Mr. Incredible had squelched Pine's wish to be his ward in an attempt to protect him, and it was not until Syndrome threatened the family's lives that Bob realized that his family was his "greatest adventure".
His red "super suit" (the term for superhero costumes in this movie), designed by Edna Mode, appears to have the same level of durability as Mr. Incredible himself. In his prime, Mr. Incredible drove a gadget-laden car, the Incredibile, not unlike the ones driven by James Bond or Batman. The silhouette of a newer version of the Incredimobile for the entire family is seen in the end credits, and makes a full appearance in the comic series.
His face was physically modeled after director Brad Bird.
Mr. Incredible was ranked number 5 in IGN's list of the Top 10 Pixar Characters. Readers of "Empire" magazine also voted Mr. Incredible number 8 in that magazine's list of The Top 20 Pixar Characters.
Elastigirl.
Helen Parr (a.k.a. Elastigirl or Mrs. Incredible) (voiced by Holly Hunter) is Mr. Incredible's wife. Helen can stretch any part of her body up to 100’ (34 m) and can be 1 mm thin. She can also reshape her body in a variety of ways. In the movie she becomes a parachute and a rubber boat, and has used her arms for swings and a slingshot. In her early years she seemed to be a feminist and had no desire to "settle down". Since her marriage to Bob Helen has become a dedicated spouse and mother, and is frustrated with her husband's continuing dreams of glory. Helen is also an experienced jet pilot (coming from having a close friend who flew her around the world when she was a Super). Her sharp wit and superb espionage skills, as well as her experience as a superhero, make her an excellent tactician and leader. Her super suit is described by Edna Mode as designed to "stretch as far as can without injuring [herself and still retain its shape. is virtually indestructible yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton."
Violet.
Violet Parr (voiced by Sarah Vowell) is a junior high school teenager stuck at the crossroads between girl and woman. Violet desperately wants to be like everyone else, to blend in with normal people, and not to stand out. Appropriately, her superpowers allow her to turn instantly invisible, and to generate spherical force fields to protect herself (and also to levitate extremely heavy objects; the interiors of the force fields have an anti-gravitational effect, allowing Violet to levitate inside), but she can be stunned temporarily if the field is struck by a sufficiently large force.
During the movie she and Dash combine their powers to create the IncrediBall (named in the video game), a tactic in which Violet generates a force field around herself, and Dash uses his speed power to use the ball like a cannonball or battering ram. Her struggle with her shyness and lack of confidence constitutes a major side story in the movie, she is spurred by Helen's encouragement that she has more power than she realizes and that she just has to believe it. In the end Violet sheds her shyness and ends up at the confident side when her crush Tony Rydinger asks her for a date.
Edna Mode designed a sturdy super suit which, unlike her normal clothes, turns invisible when Violet does.
Dash.
Dashiell "Dash" Robert Parr (voiced by Spencer Fox) is a speedster. While he is only as strong as the average 10-year-old boy, the film's official website lists "enhanced durability" amongst Dash's powers, which is implied in the film by the amount of incidental high-speed collisions and crashes Dash endures without apparent injury. Dash also discovers throughout the course of the movie that his speed allows him to be able to run over water without submerging.
Dash would like to go out for sports, but his mother Helen will not allow it because she thinks that he would show off his superspeed and blow the family's civilian cover. To vent his frustration, Dash uses his power to play pranks on his teacher, Bernie Kropp, which also threatens their cover.
Dash's reckless and impulsive nature and one-track mind have put him at odds with Violet's gloomier and more sarcastic nature more often than their parents would like, but when Dash is in battle, he cares deeply about his family; he was willing to attack a fully grown man who was about to kill his sister with an assault rifle.
His super suit is designed to be resistant to air friction, wear and heat when Dash is running at super speed.
Jack-Jack.
Jack-Jack Parr (voiced by Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews) is the Parrs' infant son, the youngest of the Parr children. According to a guidebook published by Dorling Kindersley, his hair never needs hair gel. Initially believed to be the only family member without any powers, he manifests a multitude of superhuman abilities at the end of the film, most of which are types of shapeshifting. More powers are seen in the short film "Jack-Jack Attack" on the "Incredibles" DVD, making his powers the most versatile of the family, and according to a collectible poster included with some Incredibles toys, still more powers are undisclosed.
Although Edna Mode did not know what powers Jack-Jack might develop, she covered various possibilities by making him a fireproof and bulletproof blanket sleeper-like jumpsuit. Creator Brad Bird explains on the DVD that Jack-Jack's varied abilities are a metaphor for how young children have infinite possibilities ahead of them in life.
In issue #0 of the comic series, it is mentioned that Jack-Jack's full name is John Jackson Parr.
Jack-Jack was ranked number 15 in "Empire" magazine's list of the Top 20 Pixar Characters.
Allies.
Frozone.
Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone) (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) is a long-time friend of the Parr family. Frozone is Bob Parr's best friend, and was the best man at Bob and Helen's wedding. Similar to the Marvel Comics superhero Iceman, Frozone has the power to freeze water, or even ambient moisture in the air. He is limited by the amount of water available, either in liquid form, or in the air. It is also indicated that he can use the moisture of his own body, and that dehydration weakens his abilities as a result. During the movie, it is suggested that he has adapted to civilian life much more easily than his long-time friend, Bob Parr, though he still possesses a hidden cache containing his costume and all of his old gadgets in working condition.
He married a woman whom he refers to as Honey, who is aware of his superhero past. Lucius is best friends with Bob, and a close friend of Helen and the kids, who are the only supers he socializes with following the banning of superheroes. Whenever Lucius and Bob go out on Wednesdays to engage in superheroics, they have to cover from their respective wives by claiming to be going bowling, but they stop going out when Bob is caught by Helen.
Lucius's super suit is designed to keep him warm in the cold, but he must wear a special set of refraction goggles not only to protect his identity, but also to protect his eyes from the glare of the sunlight that bounces off his ice crystals. The soles of Frozone's snowboots can change into ice skates, alpine ice skis, and a concave disc he uses as a snowboard. These forms of transport, combined with chutes of ice, result in particularly speedy travel.
Frozone was ranked number 16 in "Empire" magazine's list of the Top 20 Pixar Characters.
Edna Mode.
Edna Mode (voiced by Brad Bird) is an eccentric fashion designer who designs the costumes for many members of the superhero community. To that end, not only does she take the aesthetics of the clothes into account, but also their practical uses such as protective qualities and accommodation to the powers of the wearer. She was a guest at Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's wedding. Rick Dicker, who felt that Edna was "difficult" to work with, was the one who first referred Elastigirl to Edna. Edna was conceived as an amalgam between James Bond's gadget supplier, Q, and Oscar-winning costume designer Edith Head. Brad Bird, who voiced the character, did not specify any direct influences on the character, though Pixar artist Teddy Newton, who co-designed the character, stated that the film's animators looked for inspiration in the 1995 fashion documentary "Unzipped", which spotlighted a number of designers, including Isaac Mizrahi and Polly Mellen. Edna Mode also appeared with Pierce Brosnan to present the Academy Award for Costume Design at the 77th Academy Awards.
Edna refuses to design super suits with capes, in light of the number of supers (Dynaguy, Meta-Man, Stratogale, Thunderhead, and Splashdown) killed because their capes got caught in airliner turbines, elevators, missiles, etc.
The film's creators originally could not find an appropriate actress to voice Edna. Finally, when asking actress Lily Tomlin to voice Edna, Brad Bird provided an example of what she should sound like. Tomlin told Bird that he successfully captured voice so well that he should provide it in the film himself, which Bird did.
Edna Mode was ranked number 8 in IGN's list of the Top 10 Pixar Characters, and number 6 in "Empire" magazine's list of the Top 20 Pixar Characters.
Gazerbeam.
Gazerbeam (Simon J. Paladino) is a super mentioned and briefly seen in "The Incredibles". His powers allow him to generate energy blasts from his eyes, similar to Cyclops.
According to his biography on the DVD, Gazerbeam was originally a member of the superhero team The Phantasmics, but rivalry with team leader Everseer led to Gazerbeam's dismissal. Following the death of Dynaguy, Gazerbeam replaced him as leader of the Thrilling Three, along with previously established members Phylange and Apogee. In-group tensions and arguments eventually led the threesome to disband. When the public began suing superheroes for damages done, Gazerbeam (under the guise of Simon J. Paladino) was a pro-bono lawyer who entered politics to become a long-time advocate for superhero rights.
Gazerbeam appears alive only once in the film—as a guest during Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's wedding—and is mostly seen in photos or mentioned by others. He was featured in a Super postage stamp collection alongside Frozone, Elastigirl and Mr. Incredible; this is seen among Mr. Incredible's selection of memorabilia. His disappearance (in his civilian identity) was reported in an article in the "Metroville Tribune" newspaper, which is how Bob first learned of his disappearance. His address is shown to be Traction Avenue, in the financial district of Metroville (the street where Operation Kronos is put into effect).
In the film, Frozone compares Mr. Incredible's difficulties in adjusting to civilian life with those of the recently disappeared Gazerbeam, who experienced similar problems. As events would reveal, Gazerbeam was killed on Nomanisan Island while attempting to disable an Omnidroid - the same machine that took the lives of both other members of the Thrilling Three. The exact version was not revealed, but it was at least as late as version X4, but prior to X8, the first version later faced by Mr. Incredible. He apparently discovered the reason for his mission—i.e., Operation Kronos—and used his powers to burn the word "KRONOS" into a cavern wall on the island prior to his death. Mr. Incredible locates Gazerbeam's skeletal remains by chance while attempting to evade Syndrome and his Omnidroid; Mr. Incredible then uses the remains to convince Syndrome that he had been killed by one of Syndrome's mini-bombs. Mr. Incredible proceeds to sneak back into Syndrome's base and access the Operation Kronos computer, using Gazerbeam's final message as the password.
Rick Dicker.
Rick Dicker (voiced by Pixar animator Bud Luckey) is a government agent who was once part of the NSA (National Supers Agency) and now oversees the Superhero Relocation Program. He was one of the guests present at Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's wedding. In the DVD commentary Brad Bird jokes that he had an idea to start Bud Luckey's short film "Boundin with Rick Dicker coming into his office late at night, pulling out a bottle of "booze" and a banjo to start in on "Boundin. Rick is often frustrated by Bob clinging on to the "Glory Days", which usually ends up in Rick having to erase memories and repair damages caused by Bob's actions.
Mirage.
Mirage (voiced by Elizabeth Peña) was Syndrome's seductive right-hand woman and possible accomplice in the murder of many "supers". Though she has no superhuman abilities, she appears to have extensive computer and espionage skills. In her video-tablet message to Mr. Incredible, Mirage mentions that, according to the government, neither of them officially exists.
Initially, Mirage seemed at ease with Syndrome's casual regard to murder, but had a change of heart after Syndrome took a gamble on her life, daring an imprisoned Mr. Incredible to kill her after Incredible grabbed her and threatened to do so. Incredible abandoned his bluff, after which Mirage secretly freed him, and helped his family escape the island and foil Syndrome's plot. Her ultimate fate was not disclosed.
In the comic series, Mirage appears to have avoided severe punishment for her role in Syndrome's plans and now works as one of Rick Dicker's NSA agents. She and a reluctant Elastigirl agree to work together to investigate the disappearance of the Eiffel Tower in relation to Xerek.
Kari McKeen.
Kari McKeen (voiced by Bret Parker) is a friend of the Parrs (more than likely from Violet's school) whom Violet calls upon to babysit Jack-Jack while the rest of the family are flying to save Mr. Incredible. She's taken numerous babysitting classes and feels more than adequately prepared to care for Jack-Jack in any capacity, and assures Helen Parr to that effect. She has one scene in the film, and she is heard later on Mrs. Parr's voice mail, complaining that some "very weird things" are happening, she does apparently learn all of Jack-Jack's powers as she has a defense for all of them after one day. Her eventful night with the baby (see above) is documented in the "Jack-Jack Attack" short included on the DVD release, ending with Rick Dicker erasing her memory of the incident.
Snog.
Snog is an old friend of Helen Parr, presumably from her super days as Elastigirl. He never appears in the movie, but his voice can be heard on the phone when Helen Parr calls him to acquire a jet to access Syndrome's island. In the movie, Snog can be seen in a photograph which Helen holds, showing the two of them in holiday clothing. In the deleted scenes, Snog was intended to travel with them on the plane to the island, and would be killed in the following crash with the missiles. This scene was cut out, however.
Doc Sunbright.
Doc Sunbright appears in the Incredibles comic book produced by Boom! Studios. He is Edna Mode's cousin and is the only doctor that is fully qualified to treat the superhero community. He is styled as a typical "mad scientist", with wild gray hair and a lab coat, and shares his cousin's diminutive stature.
In the first four-part story "Family Matters", Sunbright is introduced when Frozone forces Mr. Incredible to go in for a check-up, out of concern for his weakening powers. Despite Sunbright's cutting-edge (and slightly overbearing) medical methods, he is unable to determine the cause of Mr. Incredible's condition. Later, Mr. Incredible brings in a sample of his neighbor Jill's pastries, which he had been eating for the past two weeks, upon suspicion that they might be the cause. After study, Sunbright detects traces of a power-dampening allergen within the pastries and correctly deduces that it's the cause. Later, Sunbright is able to restore Mr. Incredible's powers with an antidote.
In the next story, Sunbright is threatened by the Confederacy of Crime to tell them the location of an extremely dangerous alien virus he has hidden away. The Parr family, meanwhile, are driving to his office as Helen is about to give birth, and end up getting entangled in fighting the Confederacy. Thankfully, the Parrs are able to save Sunbright and protect the virus canister, and Helen is able to give birth to Jack-Jack without any problems.
Non-allies.
Gilbert Huph.
Gilbert Huph (voiced by Wallace Shawn) is Bob Parr's diminutive, strict boss at Insuricare. His main priority at Insuricare is the profitability of the company, irrespective of the concerns of its staff or customers. He is a stickler for bureaucracy, but would prefer customers remain ignorant of any loopholes that would help secure an insurance claim. Parr, losing his temper when working for Huph compromises the altruistic priorities he once held as a crimefighter and hero, grabs Huph by the neck and throws him through several office walls, leaving him hospitalized and in traction. This incident results in Bob revealing his super strength and losing his job.
Villains.
Syndrome.
Buddy Pine (a.k.a. Syndrome) (voiced by Jason Lee) first appears as a child who professes to be Mr. Incredible's "number 1 fan". In an attempt to earn his hero's respect, Buddy Pine tries to aid him in fighting crime as "Incredi-Boy", with gadgets of his own invention. Mr. Incredible declines Buddy's offer, and during a subsequent conflict between Mr. Incredible and the French supervillain Bomb Voyage, Buddy intervenes, and ends up with a bomb attached to his costume. Mr. Incredible's attempt to remove it leads to the destruction of a section of train tracks, which requires him to save an approaching train. Incredible then hands Buddy over to the police to be returned to his family, telling him that he works alone.
15 years later, a now adult Buddy, recreates himself as an evil genius who plots revenge on his former idol, whom Syndrome now regards as his nemesis. At one point, the DVD Director's Commentary seems to point out that his complete lack of conscience is a direct result of psychopathy, making him a mad scientist. Intensely amoral, he allows missiles fired at an airplane carrying Helen, Dash, and Violet to continue on after Helen reveals the children's presence on the plane, bets Mirage's life in a subsequent showdown when Mr. Incredible threatens to kill her, and carelessly throws a fully loaded fuel tanker down a street, endangering civilians. After his plans to fraudulently become a superhero and replace the supers that he had killed off are foiled by both the Incredibles and Frozone, Syndrome has his assets frozen by the authorities, and a warrant issued for his arrest. However, he abducts Jack-Jack with the intention of raising him as a sidekick, but fails due to the sudden emergence of Jack-Jack's powers. Syndrome vows to eventually get Jack-Jack, but Mr. Incredible tosses his car at Syndrome, causing Syndrome's cape to get caught in his jet's intake, which sucks him in, killing him, echoing the wisdom of Edna Mode's "no capes" rule.
Syndrome has no superhuman powers, but he is incredibly intelligent, making him a super in his own right. He has invented numerous weapons, and high-tech vehicles that utilize such principles as robotics, anti-gravity, and zero-point energy, which he sold to black market buyers to make himself rich. He owns his own island, complete with a mansion, a sophisticated monorail system, missiles, and a staff of guards equipped with exotic vehicles of Syndrome's design. 
Like Mr. Incredible, his character was also physically modeled after Brad Bird.
Syndrome was chosen as the 64th Greatest Villain Ever by "Wizard Magazine".
Omnidroid.
The Omnidroid is a series of intelligent and destructive robots developed by Syndrome to fight and kill Supers. Syndrome made many different versions of this battle robot. All were designed to fight and kill Supers, and each subsequent model improved upon the previous one by correcting flaws found during fights. The Omnidroid's only weakness is itself: in the film, Mr. Incredible scrambles into Omnidroid's inner workings, causing the machine to pierce its own hull in a vain attempt to pry the hero out of inside itself.
The Omnidroid series of robots were designed by Syndrome to use AI and destructive features such as claws and lasers to target and destroy its enemies. It is self-learning and can correct its own mistakes, and also collects information on superheroes it encounters.
Omnidroids were used to kill various superheroes - each time a superhero eventually defeated an Omnidroid, data from the nearly destroyed version was then used to create an improved model, specifically designed to have functions to defeat the superhero who had previously destroyed it. Through the instructions of Mirage, the superheroes do not fully destroy the Omnidroid as "it is government property".
The final Omnidroid created by Syndrome was controlled via a remote, which he uses to appear as a Superhero by "destroying" it after launching it himself into Metroville. However, the Omnidroid learns that Syndrome is controlling it and turns on him. The Omnidroid is eventually destroyed by the combined efforts of the Parr family and Frozone. 
The following is shown during "The Incredibles" credits: "The term OMNIDROID used by permission of Lucasfilm Ltd". George Lucas apparently holds a trademark on the term "droid" (it's the word used to refer to the robots in the "Star Wars" franchise) and as "Omnidroid" has the term "droid" in it, permission was requested (and granted) from Lucasfilm to use the term in the film.
Bomb Voyage.
Bomb Voyage is a villain who appears at the beginning of the movie. He is a recurring enemy of Mr. Incredible, as he is introduced, and by his language (he refers to Mr. Incredible as "Monsieur Incroyable"), outfit, the pun in his name, and music played when he appears, it is presumed that he is French. The character's name is intended to be a pun for French phrase ""Bon Voyage"". He was last seen in a tall building, confronting Mr. Incredible when Voyage was stealing something from a vault. Buddy Pine, Mr. Incredible's big-time fan and the future villain Syndrome, interrupted their impending showdown and tried to appeal to Mr. Incredible that he would be a worthy sidekick for Mr. Incredible. As Buddy flew off to get the police, Voyage plants a bomb on Buddy's cape (unknown to Buddy), forcing Mr. Incredible to release Bomb Voyage, to save Buddy. Bomb Voyage successfully made a getaway and it is unknown what happened to him afterwards. The resulting explosion destroys a section of railroad tracks, resulting in an attempt by Mr. Incredible to save the occupants of an approaching train, who then sue him for the injuries they sustained, leading to the anti-super act being passed.
In the video game version, Voyage is the main villain for the first three levels of the game and he speaks English. In the last level he is involved in, he recreates the scene in the movie, throwing a bomb in Buddy Pine's cape, forcing Mr. Incredible to save him. After this, he attempts to escape in a helicopter, and Mr. Incredible defeats him by throwing six bombs at him, causing it to fly out of control and presumably crash, killing Voyage.
In the comic series, Bomb Voyage is recruited by Xerek to make the Eiffel Tower vanish with one of his bombs, and later meets Elastigirl and Mirage in person when they arrive to investigate, when he attempts to escape, Elastigirl follows him throughout Paris and eventually shakes Xerek's location out of him. Since it has been 15 years since his appearance in the movie, Bomb Voyage has aged significantly, with a potbelly and balding hair.
Brad Bird originally pitched the idea of Bomb Voyage's name. His original idea that he would be named Bomb Pérignon in reference to the similarly named champagne Dom Pérignon, but the Moët et Chandon company rejected that.
Voyage makes a cameo in the 2007 Pixar film "Ratatouille" as a street mime.
The Underminer.
The Underminer (voiced by John Ratzenberger) is a short, almost mole-like creature who appears to be patterned after the Fantastic Four's first foe, the Mole Man. He first appears at the end of the first movie riding on a gigantic drill-tipped vehicle, where he announces his "war on peace and happiness!", leading into the last shot of the Parr family putting their masks on for battle.
This led to such a cliffhanger that the creators of the original Incredibles video game created the sequel, "". As the Underminer unleashes various killing robots and machines on Metroville, the Incredibles fight off the surface invasion while Mr. Incredible and Frozone pursue the Underminer into the depths of his underground empire. It is revealed that the Underminer plans to activate a machine called the Magnomizer, which would heavily pollute the Earth above. The two supers destroy the machine, and the Underminer is supposedly killed in his final battle against the supers.
The Underminer first appears in the comic series as part of Dash's lengthy dream sequence. Having escaped the Sporlanx aliens with Violet, Dash finds that the Underminer is supposedly still alive, and has grudgingly allied with Violet to fend off the aliens. However, as the group escape underground, Violet is forced to lead the aliens to their location through a post-hypnotic suggestion. Enraged, the Underminer shoves Violet to the magma below (having decided to get some personal revenge out of the failed escape), but Dash's dream shifts perspectives afterwards. The Underminer later makes a full appearance as one of the Unforgivables, under orders from Xerek to soil the Incredibles' reputation by creating a giant robot painted in the super family's iconic colors and rampaging through Metroville. However, he is later eliminated after completing his purpose.
Several minions and/or creations of the Underminer are introduced in "The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer":
The Scientists.
Nothing is known about the non-human Scientists other than that the Underminer holds them against their will to help modify and adjust his machines. Once the Underminer feels they have served their purpose, Mr. Incredible and Frozone must rescue them, after which the scientists run off through an escape tunnel. Following the Underminer's death, the scientists flee destruction of the Underminer's remaining robots in helicopters. They later help thaw some of their comrades out of ice cubes, and help Mr. Incredible and Frozone shut down a Gilgenbot from activation.
The Magnomizer Guardian.
The Magnomizer Guardian is the first boss character in the game. It is a floating sentry built by the Underminer to protect the Magnomizer. It is equipped with missiles and incendiary devices, and can summon other robots when needed. After Mr. Incredible disables the Guardian by throwing objects at it (see above for the summary), the Magnomizer begins to collapse, but Mr. Incredible successfully destroys the Magnomizer by unscrewing the bolts that hold the machine down. The Guardian is later heard over an audio announcement in the "Underwater Station" level, where it is ordered to report to the Underminer's platform, presumably for deactivation for failing to protect the Magnomizer.
The Crustodian.
The Crustodian is a machine built by the Underminer to lead his Giant Robot Factory in manufacturing the 100 giant robots known as the Gilgenbots. He is one of the bosses in the game. He appears to be a glass jar filled with pulsating energy, attached to a giant machine known as a Warkerbot.
After Mr. Incredible and Frozone destroy the Magnomizer, the Crustodian is alerted to their approach to the Robot Factory. It eventually does battle with the two heroes, and tricks them into activating a bomb to destroy the Factory. Incredible and Frozone destroy the Crustodian, though his head remains intact, and rolls off a ledge, where he escapes.
The Crustodian is later mentions a few times over the announcements during the heroes' battle against the last of the Underminer's remaining machines. It is last mentioned in the final level of the game, "The Corrupterator", in which the Underminer summons him to report to his platform.
Dug.
Dug was a robot built by the Underminer to operate the underwater station that powers his Doomsday machine, the Magnomizer. Dug, however, is the only robot with feelings and moral objections to the Underminer's plans, which leads to the villain's downfall.
As Mr. Incredible and Frozone travel across the collapsing station following their defeat of the Crustodian and the destruction of the Factory, they encounter Dug, who agrees to help them save the captive scientists. Upon finding the right floor, Dug refuses to go further, insisting that he stay in his station. Before the supers part ways with him, he tells them that his aiding them has had adverse effects upon the Corrupterator that would have shut it down, a process the Underminer never knew how to reverse.
Futur10n.
Futur10n (always spelled as such) appears in the Boom! Studios comic series, as part of the first four-issue miniseries "Family Matters". He is a robot who, according to Mr. Incredible, is from the 24th Century and makes regular attempts to rule the world from the past, which Mr. Incredible always foils. His chief weapon is his devolution bombs, which turns anything caught in their blast into a more primitive lifeform, so that Futur10n can command their less-advanced minds into obeying his every whim.
He initially appears attacking the Metroville Zoo, having already devolved the zoo animals into a stampede of prehistoric creatures. The Incredibles manage to stop Futur10n and put him into custody, despite Mr. Incredible's strength being inexplicably weak at the time. As Futur10n is being taken away, he mentally triggers a devolution bomb still hidden in the zoo, and only Dash's keen eyes during the TV report of his arrest allows him to spot the activation gesture. Mr. Incredible goes back to the zoo alone and retrieves the bomb from a lion cage, though he ends up being rescued himself by Frozone. After the bomb deactivates, Mr. Incredible keeps it in his den as a trophy.
Later, while Organa's clay golems are tearing the Parr house apart, Mr. Incredible tells Dash to take the bomb from his den and run to the Metroville Prison, where Futur10n sits in his cell. Dash leaves the bomb at Futur10n's feet, and the villain predictably reactivates it, allowing Dash to run the bomb all the way back to the house and have it detonate, devolving the clay golems to nothing (and Organa into a monkey).
Organa.
Organa (real name Jill Carter) is a supervillainess appearing in the comic book story "Family Matters". Like Syndrome, she bears no powers of her own, but makes up for it with her extensive knowledge of chemistry, with which she concocts chemical-based weapons and clay-like golems to aid in her criminal schemes. Years ago, Organa was Elastigirl's bitter archenemy, though Bob remarks that she is no scarier than his high school finals.
Though Elastigirl's forced retirement made Organa give up her criminal career, she still desired her old nemesis destroyed. After being released from prison on parole sometime after Elastigirl's retirement, Jill concocted a power-dampening allergen that would weaken and eventually remove one's superpowers, then channeled all her time and money into learning Elastigirl's secret identity of Helen Parr. At some point during this time, Jill met her husband Jim, got married, and had two sons, Bart and Xander, though none of them were made aware of Jill's own secret identity.
Jill eventually found Helen and arranged for her family to move next door to the Parrs. The two families quickly bonded, but Jill's plan for revenge remained in effect as she slips the allergen into her various cakes and cookies for Helen to eat. Later, with Helen presumably weakened, Jill sent her clay golems to attack the local mall and lure the super to her demise. The only one who actually eats the allergen-laced pastries, though, was Bob, which resulted in his own weakening superpowers, and required Jill to use a more direct approach after her mall attack fails.
With Jim and her children at a baseball game and out of danger, Jill creates more clay golems to attack the Incredibles in their own home, then reveals her identity as Organa to the surprised superheroes, as well as her equally surprised family, who unexpectedly arrive home early. However, the golems soon run out of control and begin to attack Jill's family, ignoring her desperate orders not to harm them as they continue to tear the house apart. Using one of Futur10n's devolution bombs, the Incredibles devolve the golems back to their chemical bases, and Jill, refusing to take cover out of shame for her actions, is devolved into a monkey.
Jill is last seen with her family in the far-off mountains, having all moved there to avoid trouble with the authorities. Even as a monkey, Jill is still intelligent enough to be with her husband and kids, and is trying to make things up to them by redoubling her job as a mother. She is briefly seen at the end of the "Grounded!" storyline, albeit still a monkey, while Bart brings in the mail, unaware of an invitation from the Unforgivables invite among the received letters.
Later in the series, Jill's older son Xander is revealed to have inherited his mother's talent for chemistry. Wearing a modified version of Organa's old costume, he and Violet manage to reunite with help of a teleporter device stolen from Doc Sunbright, and joins her in an attempt to prove himself as a true super. However, when their antics are threatened by a revived Tronasaurus, Dash learns of their relationship and agrees to keep it a secret from Bob.
The Confederacy of Crime.
The Confederacy of Crime are a group of supervillains that appear in the Boom! Studios comic book series. The group is led by Mr. Pixel, a tall man in a business suit whose face is constantly pixelated to hide his true identity. Some of the other members include Tronasaurus, a talking robotic T-Rex and Mr. Pixel's chief subordinate, Shifty, a shapeshifter whose powers can't hide the large mole on his nose (later removed, though with a telltale scar in its place), Rollergrrl, and Centsus.
In issue #0 of the series, which is set before the movie, the Confederacy invades Doc Sunbright's office to find and steal a highly dangerous alien virus with which to blackmail Washington, D.C. At the same time, the Parr family is rushing to the office as a pregnant Helen is preparing to give birth to Jack-Jack. Faced with the added complications, the Parrs work together to stop the Confederacy while Sunbright helps Helen deliver Jack-Jack. However, during the fight, Helen catches the virus canister, and Sunbright chastises her on being so close to it while pregnant for fear of affecting the baby.
In the following storyline, "City of Incredibles", Jack-Jack comes down with a cold as a result of the virus, and the nature of the virus has the effect of spreading Jack-Jack's unpredictable superpowers to others. The Confederacy of Crime kidnap Jack-Jack in order amplifying their powers by exposing themselves to the virus. When the Incredibles interfere, the Confederacy is forced to abort the plan, and only Shifty is affected by the virus, turning him into a colossal man with complete transformational abilities. After getting rid of Mr. Pixel, having grown tired of being under his authority, Shifty turns his attention towards the Incredibles, but an errant sneeze from Shifty infect his enemies and boosts their own powers, allowing them to defeat Shifty in a coordinated assault.
Mr. Pixel and Shifty are captured, and the virus is purged out of all supers who were infected, though the other Confederacy members escape in the battle. Those imprisoned in Metroville Prison, however, are invited by mail to join a new villain group, the Unforgivables. Tronasaurus is subsequently revived from his sleep and goes on a rampage through the waterfront, which Violet and Xander stumble upon.
Mezmerella.
Mezmerella, appearing in the comic story "Grounded!", is a master of hypnosis, which she is first seen using to paralyze the Incredibles in an hypnotic trance, save for Violet, who is instead willed into activating her "Psi-Glance Inverter" and destroy Metroville. Dash breaks out of his trance and, instead of stopping Violet, attacks Mezmerella. The villainess responds by shoving Violet off the rooftop, and, though Dash rescues her in time, he is chastised by Bob and Helen for showboating and is stripped of his powers through a chemical syringe.
What follows next is a series of increasingly bizarre scenarios, in which Dash discovers his teacher and principal to be mind-controlling aliens called Sporlanx, his parents are brainwashed into being their slaves, and the Underminer, who was presumed dead after the events of the second video game, is allied with Earth to fend off the invaders. However, all these events are all revealed as being part of Dash's hyper-fast imagination, in which he is trapped by Mezmerella's paralyzing trance. Fighting her power, Dash is able to regain consciousness, and defeat Mezmerella. She is then seen in prison, angered over her defeat as a contact letter for the Unforgivables arrives and proceeds to bring the prison under their control to use it as a base. She then is used in the grand plot to take over Metroville by entering a Power Amplifier that allows her to bring the entire city under her control, but put her into a state of unconsciousness from the overload.
Mezmerella is the only comics character to currently appear outside the comics series, having been incorporated into the Incredibles "Pixar Pals" show/miniparade at Disney California Adventure Park as part of a villain float that serves as target practice for child participants in "hero training"
Xerek.
Xerek is a small, seemingly harmless gentleman who is secretly one of the biggest criminal masterminds in the world. He is obsessed with Elastigirl, having been her boyfriend for a time, and is personally disgusted at how he feels her old independent streak from her youth has vanished. Contacting Bomb Voyage as a middleman, Xerek manages to teleport the entire Eiffel Tower out of Paris under the guise of it being destroyed.
When Helen and Mirage arrive to investigate, they are accosted by a group of armored mercenaries led by Bomb Voyage, who then proceeds to flee. After capturing and interrogating him, Helen finds Xerek, but is captured, and the villain tries to demoralize her by claiming that since she married Mr. Incredible, she has been wasting her life in mediocrity. Helen is unmoved by Xerek's taunts, and Mirage, having turned the mercenaries to her side with the promise of better pay, has him captured. As he is brought to prison, however, Xerek reveals that he has already turned the Metroville Prison into his own private center of operations, with which to run the Unforgivables as their leader.
For his first major plan, he employs the Underminer and loans him the technology for creating a giant robot designed to frame the Incredibles (painted in their iconic red colors). Then, by combining the disembodied brain of Everseer and Mezmerella's hypnosis, he successfully drives the citizens into turning against the heroes, leaving the Incredibles betrayed and demoralized.
Xerek was taken from the original scripts of the film but he was replaced with Syndrome when he proved to be more popular with the crew. 
Other superheroes.
Most of the following information comes from one of three main sources, two of which are scenes from the film "The Incredibles". The first is the scene, 45 minutes into the film, in which Edna Mode explains to Mr. Incredible why she refuses to design super suits with capes, during which a montage of a number of late supers' deaths is shown. The second is the scene, one hour into the film, in which Mr. Incredible hacks into Syndrome's computer files. The third source is the "NSA Files" feature in the "Top Secret" section of Disc 2 of "The Incredibles" two-disc DVD edition. A minor amount of information, such as information on Fironic, comes from other scenes in the film, as noted.

Victor J. Andrew High School

Victor J. Andrew High School, Andrew, or VJA, is a public four-year high school located in Tinley Park, Illinois, a southwest suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is the third school to become part of Consolidated High School District 230, which also includes Amos Alonzo Stagg High School and Carl Sandburg High School.
Academics.
In 2008, Andrew had an average composite ACT score of 22.8 and graduated 96.3% of its senior class. The average class size is 23.5. Andrew has not made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, the test used in Illinois to fulfill mandates in the federal No Child Left Behind Act.
Student life.
Athletics.
Andrew competes in the Southwest Suburban Conference (SWSC), and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA), which governs most sports and competitive activities in the state. The school's teams are stylized as the Thunderbolts. The Thunderbolt name and logo was based on the "Flash" trademark of the Andrew Corporation.
The school sponsors interscholastic teams for young men and women in basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, gymnastics, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and water polo. Young men may compete in baseball, football, and wrestling, while young women may compete in badminton, cheerleading, and softball.
The following teams have placed in the top four of their respective IHSA sponsored state championship tournament or meet:
The 14 top three finishes by the Andrew badminton team, and their six state championships are both the second highest totals in state history.
Activities.
The marching band is a nationally recognized field show marching band.
The first director of the Victor J. Andrew High School Marching band was Patrick Culler in 1977. During Culler's tenure, he wanted his band to strive for excellence and the current principal wanted the band to start competing. Thus, the band started competing in 1979. Later in 1982, Dan Romano inherited the band program including the marching band and all concert bands; he directed the program until 2010.
 Back in the 1980s the band didn’t have much money and didn’t excel in competition. So Dan Romano tried to give the band a base to build off of. Romano tried a different approach and after many years the band started to succeed in competition. Another thing he told the band was to "keep their feet together, shoulders back, chins up and to keep their eyes with pride."
 In 1985 the Victor J. Andrew High School Marching Band started going to band camp. The name of this camp is Pilgrim Park. Pilgrim Park is a church camp located in Princeton, Illinois (Near Peoria, IL). Since then the band annually goes to Pilgrim Park to prepare for the upcoming season. While they’re there they learn marching drill, visuals, marching techniques and keep trying to improve their music.
 The Victor J. Andrew High School Marching Band has attend many Bands Of America competitions. During their fall season they have traveled out of state to Cincinnati OH, Centerville OH, Pontiac MI, St. Louis and Indianapolis. They also attend many competitions in state. These have included Illinois State University Marching Band Invitational, Lake Park Joust, Amos Alonzo Stagg Band Jamboree, Lincoln Way East Marching Band Invitational, Mount Prospect Marching Knights. Knight of Champions Marching Band Competition, and Wheeling Marching Band Competition. Every year starting in 2010 (every other year from 1994-2008) the band competes in BOA Grand National Championships. This competition is held in the Lucas Oil Stadium which is in Indianapolis, Indiana. During their spring season they have traveled to California, Nashville, and Orlando, Florida. While in Orlando, the band usually competes in parades and concert performances. The band travels to Orlando Florida every 3 years. The band has also performed in the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade and in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC.
 In 2010 Dan Romano directed his last show called Reflections. He retired later that year and is now going back to school. The current band director is Mark Iwinski. Mark Iwinski marched in the band while he was in high school.
The district also has a Relay For Life event that donates money towards the American Cancer Society. In 2010, the Relay For Life of District 230 raised nearly $400,000. This placed them 1st in the State of youth events and boosted the event to the 2nd largest youth event in the country. This 2nd in the Nation was only behind 1 large university, Virginia Tech. The Relay has been going on for the past 13 years and was the first event of its kind in the country!

<doc id="5902267" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902267" title="Cerami">
Cerami

Cerami (Sicilian: Cirami) is a "comune" in Sicily, southern Italy, part of the Province of Enna. The town itself is perched on a mountaintop above sea level. A river also named Cerami flows through this area.
Cerami produces cereals, olives, grapes, and almonds. It also is known for cattle breeding and sheep herding. It holds a Cattle Fair during the month of August.
History.
Cerami was founded by the Greeks as part of Magna Graecia in the fourth century BC. The name Cerami derives from the Greek term "Keràmion", that means terracotta. The territory hosts several archeological areas, such as the Raffo district where remains of a Greek necropolis were discovered. 
A hilltop town, Cerami was the location of a major battle between Normans and Muslims in 1063, during the Norman conquest of the Island by Roger I of Sicily son of Tancred of Hauteville. According to historian Goffredo Malaterra, after being besieged in the neighboring town of Troina for four months, Roger and 136 ferocious Norman knights took to the field of Cerami and faced approximately 50,000 Muslim soldiers. The apparition of St. George was said to have materialized on a white horse carrying the sign of the cross on his lance and charging into the enemy where their array was the most dense. Malaterra claims the Normans slaughtered 35,000 of the enemy. According to English historian Edward Gibbon, even accounting for 5 or 6 men at arms accompanying each Norman knight into battle, and even accounting for the Normans' superior martial training, the victory was either miraculous or fabulous. Nevertheless, the Normans went on to capture the island. 
The current community rose approximately in the 11th century, and it belonged to the Count of Policastro, Simone d'Altavilla, and then to his son Manfredi. It was conquered by the Arnaldo family, and was subsequently bestowed to the Antiochia family, thus to the Manna noblemen. In 1336, the town was acquired by noblemen Rosso, who beheld it until the abolition of the feudal rights.
During the Second World War, the hamlet briefly served as headquarters for the U.S. 1st Infantry Division as it prepared to assault German strongpoints located north and south of Troina.
Main sights.
The most outstanding landmarks are the Chiesa Madre dedicated to Saint Ambrogio of the 16th century, preserving a statue of the "Madonna col Bambino " by Gagini, the gothic Church of the Madonna del Carmelo, and the baroque Church of the Abbey, that holds a Byzantine style painting of the Madonna.

Henry Bates (politician)

Henry Bates of Shasta County, California was a politician affiliated with the American Party (the "Know Nothings"). He served as California State Treasurer, 1856–1857. Prior to that, he was a member of the California State Assembly from the 13th district, 1855–1856. He was impeached by the state Senate and resigned from office. 
The initial accusation against Bates was that he had illegally deposited $88,000 with Palmer, Cook & Co. for the purpose of paying the interest on state bonds in New York City in July 1856, without requiring security for this deposit; and that the interest was not paid. A report to that effect was presented in the Senate in January, 1857. Soon afterward the assembly drew up articles of impeachment against him, for the Palmer, Cook & Co. matter, for purchasing state warrants with state funds and pocketing the difference in value; for other dubious transactions; and for a "corrupt combination" with the president of the Pacific Express Company for loaning state money. Bates was convicted, but resigned from office before he could be sentenced. The investigation and removal of Bates from office was the result of an article in the "Sacramento Bee", at the time of publication still less than one week old.

Sheriff (video game)

Gameplay.
"Sheriff" has unique controls for shooting and moving around the screen. The shooting joystick consists of a switch that can be pointed into eight different directions. The player must indicate a direction, then press the switch in order to shoot. The movement joystick is also set so that a considerable time delay exists before the new direction takes effect on screen. These controls allow the sheriff to walk in one direction while shooting in another.
The entire screen is part of the game field, except for the score indication on the top of the screen. 16 bandits surround the outer rim, marked by a dotted barricade. Bullets from either the sheriff or the bandits can destroy these barriers, and they can function as defensive walls or aiming obstacles for the player. Unbreakable bricks also exist on the midpoint of each side of the screen, and display the current level number.
The basic action taken by the enemy bandits is to walk around the outer rim while firing bullets at the sheriff, but they will sometimes enter into the central area, along with a change in game music. The sheriff must avoid touching the bandits, dodge bullets, and shoot all 16 bandits to complete each level.
Legacy.
A remake of the original titled "Sheriff 2" was released in 1979, but few changes were made other than the addition of color graphics and minor changes in bonus scoring. The game was also duplicated by Exidy in 1980 and released as "Bandido", but it is unclear whether this was an officially licensed release.
The game was originally released in two formats; an upright cabinet and a cocktail (tabletop) version. These versions also made their way into Europe and Asia via imports. In the UK, "Sheriff" was licensed for production and distribution by Bell-Fruit Manufacturing in an upright cabinet. Bell-Fruit's core product range at the time was fruit/slot machines. Sheriff (and later Puckman) marked the company's first, and short lived, diversification into the market of video games as licensee, so the cabinet design for this territory differed considerably from that of the Japanese version. Although it featured the same marquee and bezel design, it shared many properties more commonly associated with slot machines (e.g. no side art or cabinet decals). However, the game's title in this region remained unchanged as "Sheriff".
The game title appears in the staff credits sequence on the Game Boy Camera software, and as a collectable trophy in "Super Smash Bros Melee".
Sequels.
Many players were unable to cope with the 8-way joystick of the original game, leading to its relative unpopularity. The sequel, "Sheriff 2" was released in 1979, with the characters changed to cute animals, and a greatly simplified control system. The 8-way joystick used for shooting was replaced with a normal button, so the sheriff can only shoot in the direction he is facing. Another game pattern was also added, where the bandits enter into the central area, but run straight through the top half instead of chasing the sheriff. The player can gain bonus points if he manages to shoot all of the bandits while they are running through the central area. However, "Sheriff 2" was not distributed widely enough to gain any sort of following.
The game was left forgotten for over two decades after the two arcade releases, but was reanimated in "", released for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. In "WarioWare", "Sheriff" was included as both a microgame and as a minigame (Wario's Sheriff) in which Wario takes the role of the sheriff. Standard controls apply to the microgame version, but in the minigame version, the L/R buttons can make the sheriff face in the opposite direction without moving. The time delay for moving the sheriff was removed, and the sheriff's walking speed is greatly increased from the original. When the player's points double after completing a certain amount of levels, the sheriff also gains extra lives, lowering the game's difficulty considerably.

A notarized document dated February 9, 1733 attests to the existence of Catenanuova at that date. Between 1731 and 1736 Catenanuova became a small urban center with full autonomy. The name of the town derived from "Aci Catena" and changed from "Terra della Nuova Catena" to "Catena la Nuova" to the present "Catenanuova".

<doc id="5902361" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902361" title="Los Angeles flood of 1938">
Los Angeles flood of 1938

The Los Angeles flood of 1938 was responsible for inundating much of Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, California during February and March 1938. The flood was caused by a pair of Pacific storms that swept inland across the Los Angeles Basin, causing abnormally high rainfall across much of coastal Southern California. Between 113 to 115 people were killed in what ultimately became one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in Southern California history. The flood caused the Santa Ana, Los Angeles, and San Gabriel Rivers to burst their banks, washing away roads, bridges, and buildings, and stranding hundreds of people. Damages in parts of Los Angeles County were moderated by dams in the San Gabriel Mountains, while Orange and Riverside Counties took more damage because of the lack of flood-control works in the Santa Ana River system.
The flooding event of 1938 is considered a 50-year flood. It resulted in $40 million of damages, and the Red Cross deemed it the "fifth largest flood in history". In response to the floods, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began channelizing local streams and building more flood control dams. Dams built in the aftermath of the flood include Sepulveda Dam, Hansen Dam, Prado Dam, and Whittier Narrows Dam, which hydrologically connects the San Gabriel River to the Rio Hondo. These works have been instrumental in protecting coastal Southern California from subsequent flooding events, although the storms of 1969 and 2005, which had larger volume than the 1938 flood, still caused major damage and forced the evacuation of low-lying areas.
Background.
Between February 27 and 28, 1938, a storm from the Pacific Ocean moved inland into the Los Angeles Basin, running eastward into the San Gabriel Mountains. The area received almost constant rain totaling from February 27-March 1. This caused minor flooding that affected only a few buildings in isolated canyons and some low-lying areas along rivers.
Fifteen hours later on March 1, at approximately 8:45 PM, a second storm hit the area, creating gale-force winds along the coast and pouring down even more rain. The storm brought rainfall totals to in the lowlands and upwards of in the mountains. When the storm ended on March 3, the resulting damage was huge.
Flooding effects.
Overall, the flood of 1938 destroyed 5,601 buildings, damaging a further 1,500, and stranded over 800 cars. The floods carried large amounts of debris and sediment down from the mountains, burying roads and stopping traffic for many days. The general hospital of Los Angeles County was threatened by rising floodwaters, which had inundated the backup power generator.
More than 20 structures were destroyed in the Arroyo Seco canyon, but there were no fatalities there. 
Damage was probably most severe along the Santa Ana River in San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange Counties further south. Without any flood control dams, the river swelled to over , almost half the flow of the Mississippi River. The flooding was so intense that it transformed most of low-lying northwestern Riverside County and northern Orange County into a large lake. The town of Agua Mansa in Riverside County, with a population of over 200, was completely swept away. The cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana, further downstream in Orange County, were covered with up to of water.
The Los Angeles River reached a maximum flood stage of . The Tujunga Wash reached its peak flow on March 3, with a water flow of an estimated , after the Big Tujunga Dam had begun emergency spillway releases. In the San Fernando Valley, the floodwaters swept through many areas after escaping their normal channels of Tujunga Creek and its tributaries. Waters reached deep into the valley and flooded portions of Van Nuys and Lankershim Boulevard. This extensive flooding brought about the building of Hansen Dam.
The San Gabriel River reached a peak of at the confluence of the East and West Forks. The water swept into the reservoir of the nearly completed San Gabriel Dam, filling it to capacity. Dam operators held releases to a maximum of , while further downstream Morris Dam was able to reduce the flood to . As a results, large areas of the San Gabriel Valley were spared from flooding, although damages still occurred locally on smaller streams that drain out of the mountains.
Although most of the damage occurred on the windward (western) side of the San Gabriel Mountains, large amounts of rain also fell on the east side which drains to the Mojave Desert. The Littlerock Dam on Little Rock Creek overtopped during the flood due to a damaged spillway siphon that had been plugged by debris swept downstream, while another dam in Pickens Canyon produced such large flood releases that it inundated the Roosevelt district of Lancaster.
Aftermath.
Many people were marooned in the San Gabriel Mountains following the storms, as severe mudslides and flooding prevented their escape. It was said that all roads leading into the mountains had been washed out in some way and notably, Big Tujunga Canyon was "all but swept clean of structures that were not up above the flood line".
Dams such as the San Gabriel River dams and one on Big Tujunga Creek greatly reduced the flooding in many areas. It was said that "Were it not for the Big Tujunga Dam, which finally filled to capacity and began spilling, the flood on the Los Angeles River would have been much worse than it already was." 
Los Angeles County was not the most affected by the floods; Riverside and Orange "took the brunt of the waters" like "gargantuan saucers". (Los Angeles Times, 1938.) At the time, Los Angeles county was the most populous of the three; Orange and Riverside were mostly farming and ranching regions. Therefore, many people were spared by the distribution of floodwaters.
Media and news attention.
The "Los Angeles Times" chartered a United Air Lines Mainliner to provide them an aerial view of flooding damage. The reporter was said to comment that "Disaster, gutted farmlands, ruined roads, shattered communications, wrecked railroad lines—all leap into sharp-etched reality from that altitude." The Los Angeles River also was not the most affected watershed; the Santa Ana River, at twice its length, was famously commented on as being "swollen crazy-mad".

Friedl Dicker-Brandeis

Frederika "Friedl" Dicker-Brandeis (30 July 1898 Vienna – 9 October 1944 Auschwitz-Birkenau), was an Austrian artist and educator murdered by the Nazis in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp .
Biography.
Frederika Dicker, she married Pavel Brandeis in 1936. Dicker-Brandeis was a student of Johannes Itten at his private school in Vienna, and later followed Itten to study and teach at the Weimar Bauhaus. She was involved in the textile design, printmaking, bookbinding, and typography workshops there from 1919-1923. After leaving the Bauhaus, she worked as an artist and textile designer in Berlin, Prague, and Hronov.
In World War II.
Dicker-Brandeis and her husband were deported to the Terezín "model ghetto" in December 1942. During her time at Terezín, she gave art lessons and lectures.
She helped to organize secret education classes for the children of Terezín. She saw drawing and art as a way for the children to understand their emotions and their environment. In this capacity she was giving art therapy.
At Terezin she persisted in pursuing her goal — ""to rouse the desire towards creative work."" 
In September 1944, Brandeis was transported to Auschwitz; Dicker-Brandeis volunteered for the next transport to join him. But before she was taken away, she gave to Raja Engländerova, the chief tutor of Girls' Home L 410, two suitcases with 4,500 drawings to whom she also taught Hana Brady.
F. Dicker-Brandeis died in Birkenau on 9 October 1944. Her husband Pavel, survived.
Legacy.
After the war, Willy Groag, the director of the Girl's home L 410 brought the suitcases with children's drawings to the Jewish Community in Prague. From the nearly 660 authors of the drawings, 550 were killed in the Holocaust. The drawings are now in the Jewish Museum in Prague's collection, with some on display in the Pinkas Synagogue in Prague.
In 1999, a Friedl Dicker-Brandeis exhibition, organized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and curated by Elena Makarova of Israel, opened in Vienna. The exhibition was shown in Czech Republic, Germany, Sweden, France, USA, and Japan. Tokyo Fuji Art Museum founder Daisaku Ikeda, who was instrumental in bringing the exhibit to Japan, comments, "The various artworks left behind by this great woman and the children of Terezin are their legacy to the present, to all of us today. They demand that we continue in our quest for a society that truly treasures human life, transcending all differences of race, religion, politics and ideology. It remains my heartfelt hope that this exhibit may provide a moment of introspection for its viewers, a moment for us to reaffirm the importance of our rights as human beings and the value of life itself."

Ciṟupañcamūlam

Siruppanchamulam(Tamil: சிருப்பஞ்சமுலம்) is a Tamil poetic work of didactic nature belonging to the "Pathinenkilkanakku" anthology of Tamil literature. This belongs to the 'post Sangam period' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. "Siruppanchamulam" contains 100 poems written by the poet Kariyaasaan. He was probably a Jain by religious persuasion. This and the fact that he was a student of one Makkayanaar is known from the introductory poem of this book. The poems of "Siruppanchamulam" are written in the Venpa meter.
"Siruppanchamulam" uses the analogy of the traditional herbal medicine, which uses the roots of the five herbs "kandankatthiri" (a plant of the nightshade family – "Solanum xanthocarpum"), "siruvzhuthunai", "sirumalli", "perumalli", and "nerunji" (a thorny prostrate plant – "Tribulus terrestris") to cure certain maladies. "Siruppanchamulam" similarly uses five different maxims to illustrate correct behaviour. 
The following poem lists the five things, namely, a chaste girl, the humility of the learned, friendly neighbouring countries, benevolent kings under whose reign there are timely rains and loyal assistants as sweet as ambrosia.

Born in New York City and raised in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, he trained to be a musician. But in need of steady work, Barrie took a salesman job with the hair products company Rayette during the 1930s.
Rayette and Barrie purchased the perfume and hair-care company Fabergé Inc. for $26 million in 1964, and the Brut line began achieving international success soon after.
Barrie was considered to be a pioneer in the area of celebrity endorsements, as he wooed stars such as Laurence Harvey, Cary Grant, Farrah Fawcett, Joe Namath, Roger Moore, Muhammad Ali and Margaux Hemingway to pitch company products.
Barrie and his Brut Productions produced the very successful film "A Touch of Class" (1973) which starred Glenda Jackson and George Segal, as well as "Whiffs" (1975), "Sweet Hostage" (1975), "Thieves" (1977), "Nasty Habits" (1977), and "Fingers" (1978).
Barrie and Sammy Cahn were nominated for the 1975 Oscar for Best Original Song, after writing "Now That We're In Love." Barrie and Cahn had been nominated in the same category in 1973, for "All That Love Went To Waste."

Tung Shing

Tung Shing () is a Chinese divination guide and almanac. It consists primarily of a calendar based on the Chinese lunar year.
History.
"Tung Shing" originated from "Wong Lik" (黃曆, the "Yellow Calendar"), which is rumoured to have been written by the Yellow Emperor. It has changed its form numerous times throughout the years during all the dynasties; the latest version was said to have been edited by the Qing dynasty and was called the Tung Shu (通書). "Tung" (通) means "myriad" or "all", "Shu" (書) means "book", so "Tung Shu" literally meant "All-knowing Book". However, in Cantonese Chinese and Mandarin Chinese, the pronunciation of the word for "book" is a homophone of a word for "defeated" (輸), so "Tung Shu" sounded like "Defeated in All Things" (通輸). Therefore, the name was changed to "Tung Shing" (通勝), which meaning "Victorious in All Things".
Contents.
Most of the contents of the book deals with what is suitable to do on each day. Some Chinese families still follow these days for wedding ceremonies, funerals, etc. 
"Tung Shing" is also used by many fung shui practitioners and destiny diviners to compliment other date selection methods for selecting dates and times for important events like marriages, official opening ceremonies, house moving-in and big contract signings, as well as smaller events like time to start renovations or travel.
The most common use of "Tung Shing" is in choosing a wedding date. "Tung Shing" contains information on the auspicious and inauspicious days for weddings and/or engagements. In addition, it provides the auspicous timing in which to carry out such activities.
"Tung Shing" also provide a conversion of years and date between the lunar year and the common year. In more detailed versions, the calendar will list eclipses (both solar and lunar), the start of each season, and days when it will be cold or hot. It also teaches ethics and values through stories.
"Tung Shing" sold in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan are based on two late-Qing versions. It is known for its English definitions and words transliterated into Cantonese characters.

Hispanic Television Network

Hispanic Television Network (HTVN) is a defunct family-oriented television network that was once the third-largest Spanish-language network in the United States, after Univision and Telemundo. It was the first network to specifically target Hispanics of Mexican origin, the first Spanish-language network to take advantage of digital technology, and the first Spanish-language network to broadcast over the Internet.
HTVN operated from 2000 through 2003 and at one time could be viewed over-the-air on nearly 70 television stations, on approximately 300 cable systems, and on the Internet. HTVN was owned by Hispanic Television Network, Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas.
History.
A New Network.
HTVN was launched in early 2000 following the creation of Hispanic Television Network, Inc. from the merger of Hispano Television Ventures and American Independent Network, Inc., both of Fort Worth. While the new company owned both HTVN and English-language network American Independent Network, it focused the majority of its attention on HTVN. The network's facilities were all-digital and state-of-the-art.
Early Successes.
The new network expanded rapidly, and by March 2000, appeared on 25 television stations, including those in top-10 Hispanic markets Los Angeles, Dallas, Phoenix, San Antonio and Brownsville, Texas.
By June 2000, HTVN had announced deals with Yahoo! to broadcast network programming on the Internet and with Mexinema and Excalibur Media Group [http://www.excaliburmg.com to give HTVN the rights to over 500 Mexican-made, Spanish-language movies. It was now on nearly 60 television stations, including full-service flagship station KLDT in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Including cable coverage, HTVN reached over 20 million homes.
By the end of the year, HTVN had added full-service KJLA in the Los Angeles market and had partnered with Mexican broadcasting giant MVS Television, providing the network access to MVS' state-of-the-art production facilities and talent base, allowing HTVN to produce programming in the United States, which was scarce at that time.

The rapid growth proved to be costly, however, as HTVN's owners reported a 14,492% increase in expenses from first quarter 1999 to first quarter 2000, no doubt the bulk of it from launching the new network. Furthermore, the network did not produce nearly sufficient revenues to cover expenses and their owners announced a $38 million loss for 2000 against only $620,955 in revenue [http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?id=3898].
By 2002, HTVN had all but abandoned its over-the-air strategy and was turning its attention to mostly cable distribution. Still, the network was not bringing in sufficient revenue to cover its expenses, and despite its owners' attempts to acquire revenue from other sources, they filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in July 2002.
In early 2003, Hispanic Television Network, Inc. sold its cable agreements to Hispanic children's network, ¡Sorpresa! and on July 10, 2003, HTVN formally ceased operations [http://www.secinfo.com/dVm4h.2j.htm].
In 2009 a new (and unrelated) effort toward a nationwide over-the-air Spanish-language network launched, Estrella TV.
Contributing factors to network's demise.
Many factors contributed to HTVN's demise, but three major issues stand out:

Regalbuto

Regalbuto (Latin: Ameselum; Sicilian: Regarbutu) is a "comune" in the province of Enna, in region of Sicily in southern Italy. 
There is an annual cattle fair held in the month of August.
History.
Regalbuto may very well be the ancient town of Amaselos, which was named by the Greek and Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus in his "Bibliotheca historica" (Historical Library) writings.
The name Regalbuto derives from the Arab term "Rahal Abbud", which means "Abbud's farmhouse", because the Arabs founded it. Discoveries at the site include the old Saracen quarter.
Around AD 1200, the inhabitants of the nearby town of Centirupe, who rebelled against the Swabian dynasty whom Regalbuto had been faithful to, destroyed Regalbuto. Years later, King Manfred had the town rebuilt at its present site.
In the year 1860, a number of members of parliament met in Regalbuto with Garibaldi to discuss a truce.
The town was never subject to fiscal taxes, and a free magistracy elected by the king and the archbishops of Messina governed it. The town was severely damaged during the Second World War, and on August 3, 1943 the Hermann Goring Panzer Division was driven out of the town by 1st Canadian Infantry Division. The current inhabited center was reconstructed only recently.
Architecturally, the notable monuments are the "Chiesa Madre" (Mother Church) dedicated to San Basilio, which was built on the site of a 16th-century building and preserving a luxurious 10 meter altar dedicated to San Vito, this church has a baroque façade with a pyramid shaped bell tower. The 15th-century Church of Santa Maria della Croce with its splendid baroque staircase, and the 18th-century Church of San Giovanni, that has a big bell loggia. Noteworthy are also the "palazzo municipale" (town hall building) of the 18th century, and the remains of the 13th-century castle.
Regalbuto also accommodates numerous aristocratic buildings such as the 17th century "Palazzo Citelli-Fascaro", "Palazzo Falcone", the liberty-style "Palazzo Campagnini", the "Palazzo Municipale" and "Palazzo Carchiolo", all situated in the old Christian Quarter.
In the city environs are sites of naturalistic interest like the Pozzillo Lake district, one of the largest man-made lakes in all Europe, fed by the Salso River waters, that offers a range of leisure opportunities, from trout fishing to sporting activities. Finally, is the Monte Mascari, tall, north of the lake, and, still in the lake vicinity, the Salici Mount rising to .
Among Regalbuto's renowned names, there was Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia (1510–1580), physician and a major figure in the history of the science of human anatomy. Also, Salvatore Citelli (1875–1947) a very famous odontologist.

St. Louis Ambush (NPSL)

The St. Louis Ambush was a professional indoor soccer team based in St. Louis, Missouri. Originally located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the team played one season at Tulsa's Pavilion Expo Square. Vernon Riggs was the general manager. Keith Dial was the managing general partner. Former Tulsa Roughneck and Major Indoor Soccer League player Victor Moreland was signed to be the player/coach.
The Wichita-based ownership group had hoped to buy a Wichita NPSL franchise but moved forward with the team in Tulsa when the Wings remained in the MISL for the 1991-1992 season. When the Wings did join the NPSL for the 1992-93 season after the MISL folded with two other MISL teams (Cleveland and Baltimore) and after searching for Tulsa owners, the team was sold to St. Louis physicians Dr. Abraham Hawatmeh and Dr. Richard Rende in the summer of 1992. Hawatmeh and Rende moved the franchise to St. Louis.
The Ambush made the playoffs every year that they played in St. Louis, except their final year of 1999-2000. The Ambush won one National Professional Soccer League championship (1994-1995 season), and played in four NPSL Championship series (1994, 1995, 1998, 1999), losing to the Cleveland Crunch twice (in 1994 and 1999), and to the Milwaukee Wave (1998), but defeated the Harrisburg Heat in 1995 for their lone NPSL title.
In 2013, an expansion team in the current Major Indoor Soccer League was named after this franchise.

Elāti

Elathi(Tamil:ஏலாதி) is a Tamil poetic work of didactic nature belonging to the "Pathinenkilkanakku" anthology of Tamil literature. This belongs to the 'post Sangam period' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. "Elathi" contains 80 poems written by the poet Kani Methaviyar. The poems of "Elathi" are written in the Venpa meter.
"Elathi" uses the analogy of the traditional herbal medicine known as "elathi" which uses six herbs such as "elam" (cardamom), "ilavankap pattai" (cinnamon), "naagakesaram" (made from the stamens of the Ceylon ironwood), "milagu" (black pepper), "thippili" (long pepper), and "sukku" (dried ginger). "Elathi" similarly uses six different maxims to illustrate correct behaviour. 
The following poem lists the six things, namely, fame, wealth, integrity, courage, education and philanthropy that add beauty to those who follow the scriptures.

The Anvil (album)

The Anvil is the second studio album by British new wave band Visage, released in March 1982. The album reached No. 6 in the UK and was certified "Silver" by the British Phonographic Industry in April 1982.
History.
This album sparked a brief controversy at the time of its release for being named after New York's famous gay club.
The only musician of the first album line-up that did not participate in this album's recording was John McGeoch. McGeoch commented in an interview: "One time I was in Spain ["touring with Siouxsie and the Banshees"] at the same time as Visage were recording the second album in London. Rusty wanted me to put a guitar solo on something or other but I only had one day off and there was no way that I could fly home on my one day off. Rusty is not a man to be put off by such things and he was actually trying to put together a satellite linkup from Madrid to London for this one guitar part. Not surprisingly it didn't come off but I was sorry not to have been as involved on "The Anvil" as I had been on the first album".
"The Anvil" was also the last Visage project to feature Ultravox frontman Midge Ure who left the band after its release.
The original vinyl release of "The Anvil" came in an embossed/textured sleeve (considered as deluxe packaging for the time), and a limited number of copies (3000) came with a free poster of Steve Strange posing with a number of models at the Hôtel George-V in Paris (the poster is an extended shot of the 12" single cover of "The Damned Don't Cry").
The album saw a re-release on the CD format in 1997 with bonus tracks, though they are tracks from the 1980/1 "Visage" era and not that of "The Anvil".
"The Anvil" was re-released on CD again by Cherry Red Records on 17 March 2008, containing more bonus tracks and detailed liner notes.

US Montauban

US Montauban were a French rugby union club, which competed in the Top 14 competition between 2007 and 2010, after being promoted from Rugby Pro D2 for the 2006-07 season. They were based in Montauban in the "département of" Tarn-et-Garonne in Midi-Pyrénées.
In April 2010, it was announced the club would be relegated from the Top 14 to the Rugby Pro D2 at the end of the 2009/2010 season after breaking budget rules for the league. Although the club appealed the ruling it started to release players to reduce its budget. The club was not in the relegation zone at the time, thereby saving CS Bourgoin-Jallieu, Aviron Bayonnais and Montpellier Hérault RC a nervous run in as they were in the relegation battle with Montauban. On the 26 April 2010, the club filed for bankruptcy at a commercial court following a meeting of the club's board of directors.
On 24 May 2014, it was announced that they had won promotion back to Pro D2 for the 2014–15 season as a result of winning the Fédérale 1 semi-final 35 – 12 against Lille Métropole Rugby.
History.
The club was established in 1903. The club made its first championship appearance in the 1967 season, when it captured its first championship title, defeating CA Bègles 11 points to 3 in Bordeaux. It gained promotion from Pro D2 for the 2006-07 season.
In its first match of the 2006-07 season, Montauban defeated Narbonne 41-20, gaining five points (including a bonus point) to go to second in the table after round one. The team continued in surprisingly strong form for a newly promoted team, notably handing early runaway league leaders Stade Français their first defeat of the season, 15-9, in Round 10 on 6 October. Montauban ended the season in seventh place, a respectable position for a newly promoted team. The 2007-08 season saw it consolidate its Top 14 position, again finishing seventh. Because Toulouse advanced to the final of the that year's Heineken Cup, which was farther than any team from England or Italy, Montauban was given a place in the 2008-09 Heineken Cup, pooled with champions Munster.

Ācārakkōvai

Acharakkovai () is a poetic work of didactic nature belonging to the "Pathinenkilkanakku" anthology of Tamil literature. This belongs to the 'post Sangam period' corresponding to between 100 – 500 CE. "Acharakkovai" contains 100 poems written by the poet Peruvaayin Mulliyaar. The poems of "Acharakkovai" are written in the Venpa meter.
Literature.
"Acharakkovai" literally translates to "the garland of right conduct" of a Saiva author, Kayatturp Peruvayil Mulliyar. "Acharakkovai" shows influences of Sanskrit literature and hence believed to be of a later period than the other poems in the "Pathinenkilkanakku" anthology. The instructions in "Acharakkovai" are concerned with personal ritual and the correct method to follow. The work has 100 stanzas in "venpa" meter and is a collection of moral exhortations, ritual observances and customs that are considered proper and correct. 8 poems (1, 10, 27, 36, 46, 55, 56, 100) follow "patrodai venpa" ("venpa" having lines of five), 52 poems (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 39, 40, 41, 42, 45, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 65, 70, 71, 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 81, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 93, 97, 98, 99) follow "innisai chithial venpa" ("venpa" with 3 lines), 33poems (2, 4, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, 26, 32, 34, 35, 38, 43, 44, 47, 50, 53, 57, 58, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 74, 76, 82, 83, 84, 94, 95, 96) follow "innisai venpa" ("venpa" with 4 lines), 1 poem (33) follows "kural venpa" ("venpa" with lines of 2), 1 poem (16) follows "cavalai venpa" ("venpa" with lines of four) and remaining 5 poems (37, 79, 80, 85, 92) follow "nerisai venpa" ("venpa" with lines of four).
Morals.
The book is rich in etiquette and taboos, which are classificatory of any literature teaching morals.
Etiquette.
The general importance of character elements of an individual namely blessings of parents (4), respect of five elements namely "brahmins", cows, the Sun, the moon, the king & teachers (15,16, 74) and importance of speech (1) is stressed. Eating rules of eating like eating after feeding elderly, cows, birds and children (21, 26, 86) and direction of eating (24). Invite and prostrate before elders (62, 72, 40), carry umbrella for elders (60), not calling elders by name (80), not treating them arrogantly by words or body language (91), speaking by covering mouth (97), be attentive (94, 41), using the same nice tone with elders and inferiors (80), never despise food offered & self boast about rituals performed(88) and not use prolonged abuse of wife (80). One should feed everyone during marriages, festivals and parental rituals (48); greet everyone heartily (31), never walk between Brahmins or deities, or between lamps and persons (31, 36). The way of dressing, speaking and reprimanding reveals the nature of a person (49) and the necessity of being modest is highlighted in 71.
Taboos.
Twenty nine stanzas detail various taboos that throw superstition of the time. Verses 5-8 deal with "eccil" (pollution) that arises from urination, excretion, sexual contact, saliva, looking at an untouchable, but broadly misses the birth and death time pollutions. While bathing one must now swim, spit into water (14, 35, 36) and one should not see his reflection in water, scratch ground (13), not wear others' soiled slippers or clothes (12, 36), wear two garments while coming out of bath with one garment (11), not sleep opposite to door step (22, 45), nor facing north or midway point (30), use of both hands while providing drinks to elders (28), extinguish fire with water during the day (33), bow towards one sneezes (31), spitting or passing motion in various places (32), not to excrete facing south during the day or north during night (33), not pass motions imagining one is facing all ten directions (34).
Caste Treatise.
The notion of untouchability seems to have emerged in the Sangam period itself with references from the work indicating water touched by "pulaiyar" being considered unfit for consumption of higher caste. "Pulaiyars" are referred as keepers of burning ghats and caretakers of cremation.
Criticism.
The presence of this work in the Sangam literature is debated as the period of compilation is found to be in the late 8th century. There is heavy dosage of "Brahminical" influence in verses 2, 5, 15, 31, 34, 41, 47, 48, 61, 64 and 92). There is heavy influence of Sanskrit literature in the style of the work.

Jimmy Bowen

James "Jimmy" Bowen (born November 30, 1937) is an American record producer and former pop music performer. Bowen is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and holds an MBA with honors from Belmont University. He presently lives with his wife Ginger in Phoenix, Arizona.
Bowen is responsible for bringing Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood together. He is also responsible for teaming Nancy up with Mel Tillis for their album, "Mel & Nancy".
Biography.
Bowen was born in Santa Rita, New Mexico. His family moved to Dumas, Texas, when he was eight years old. He began as a teenage recording star in 1957 with "I'm Stickin' With You," originally the flip side of the hit record "Party Doll" by Buddy Knox, but ultimately a Top 20 recording on its own, peaking at No. 14 on "Billboard"'s pop chart. Bowen's version sold over one million copies, and was awarded a golddisc. Bowen's singing career, however, did not take off as well as that of Knox, his partner in the Rhythm Orchids, and ultimately he abandoned a singing career, choosing to stay in the production end of the music industry.
In the early 1960s, in Los Angeles, California, he bucked the 1960s rock phenomenon when Frank Sinatra hired him as a record producer for Reprise Records, and Bowen showed a strong knack for production, getting chart hits for Sinatra, Dean Martin, Bert Kaempfert and Sammy Davis, Jr., regarded as too old-fashioned for the sixties market. He also produced Dino, Desi & Billy.
In mid-1968 Bowen launched an independent record label, Amos Records, which lasted until 1971. Leaving Los Angeles for Nashville, Tennessee, Bowen became president of a series of record labels, and took each one to country music preeminence. His success stories during the second half of the 70s included Glen Campbell, Kenny Rogers, Hank Williams, Jr., The Oak Ridge Boys, Reba McEntire, George Strait, Suzy Bogguss, Kim Carnes and Garth Brooks in the 80s. Bowen also revolutionized the way music was recorded in Nashville, introducing digital technology and modernizing the way instruments such as drums, for example, were recorded and mixed. 
In 1988 Bowen founded a label called Universal Records (not to be confused with the current Universal Records), which he sold to Capitol Records a year later.
Soundtracks.
Bowen produced his first movie soundtrack in 1970, for "Vanishing Point", which was released in 1971. That soundtrack contains three songs which he composed, as well as music from the band "Mountain" and from Big Mama Thorton. The three Bowen pieces are an incidental theme called "Love Theme," credited to Jimmy Bowen Orchestra, and two others, "Super Soul Theme" and the hard-rock piece "Freedom of Expression," credited to The J.B. Pickers. Other soundtracks include the movies "Smokey and the Bandit II" (1980), " The Slugger's Wife" (1985), and the soundtrack of the theater play "Big River" (1988).

Mo' Mega

"Mo' Mega" is the second full-length album by hip hop artist Mr. Lif, released on June 13, 2006 on the Definitive Jux label. The album was largely produced by El-P but also features production work from Edan, Australian producer Nick Toth, and Mr. Lif himself. Lyrical guest appearances come from El-P, Aesop Rock, Murs, Blueprint, and Lif's Perceptionists rapping partner Akrobatik.
The album title is described, "Mo' represents the dialect of the Black slave in America. Mega represents the hyper-modernized world we live in. As the cost of living increases at an exponential rate, more of us are finding it difficult to keep pace. I feel that the term Mo' extends beyond race to describe the masses whom have not achieved elite levels of wealth. Mo' Mega is the juxtaposition of the slave and the elite with no common ground between the two."
Although not critically acclaimed on the same level as "I Phantom", "Mo' Mega" still received mostly favorable reviews, scoring a total of 75/100 on MetaCritic.

Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) of the United States Navy is located in Orlando, Florida in the Central Florida Research Park adjacent to the University of Central Florida (UCF). The facility is a part of a larger installation Naval Support Activity Orlando (NSA Orlando). The Commanding Officer (CO) of NAWCTSD, an aeronautically designated U.S. Navy Captain, is dual-hatted as the CO of NSA Orlando.
The division is the principal Navy center for research, development, test and evaluation, acquisition and product support of training systems for the U.S. Navy and aviation training systems for the U.S. Marine Corps. It also provides interservice coordination and training systems support for the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard.

"SEMPER FIDELIS!"]]
The roots of the NAWCTSD reach back to April 1941 when then-Commander Luis de Florez became head of the new Special Devices Desk in the Engineering Division of the Navy’s Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer). De Florez championed the use of "synthetic training devices" and urged the Navy to undertake development of such devices to increase readiness. In June, the desk became the Special Devices Section.
Throughout World War II, the Section developed numerous innovative training devices including ones that used motion pictures to train aircraft gunners, a device to train precision bombing, and a kit with which to build model terrains to facilitate operational planning in the field.
The Special Devices Section grew and became the Special Devices Division. In August 1946, the Division, at its newest home at Port Washington, Long Island, NY, was commissioned the Special Devices Center.
As NAWCTSD evolved and grew, it was aligned at various times under several different parent organizations within the Navy. In 1956, it became the Naval Training Device Center. Over a three-year period in the mid-1960s, the Center moved from its Long Island location to Orlando, Florida, taking residence as a tenant activity at the then-Orlando Air Force Base, that installation subsequently becoming Naval Training Center Orlando in 1968 until its closure in 1999 pursuant to a 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision.
In 1985, the then-Naval Training Equipment Center (NTEC) became the Naval Training Systems Center (NTSC). In 1988, the Center moved to its present headquarters, the main building complex named for its founding father, de Florez. On October 1, 1993, the Naval Training Systems Center became today's NAWCTSD. In 2003, the command was briefly renamed Naval Air Systems Command Training Systems Division (NAVAIR-TSD), but has since reverted to its original name. In 2005, the physical facility and property was also designated as Naval Support Activity Orlando, making it the sole remaining active duty U.S. Navy installation in Orlando. NAWCTSD remains a significant component of the Naval Air Systems Command.
Naval Support Activity Orlando.
The land and main buildings on which the main NAWCTSD facility is located inside the Central Florida Research Park is a U.S. Government installation known as Naval Support Activity Orlando. Additional nearby buildings and facilities are shared in partnership with the Central Florida Research Park and UCF and house other Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) activities, to include the U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI), the U.S. Marine Corps Program Manager for Training Systems (PMTRASYS), the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS), the U.S. Coast Guard Liaison Office, and the United States Army Simulation and Training Technology Center.
As previously stated, the Commanding Officer of NAWCTSD is concurrently dual-hatted as the Commanding Officer of NSA Orlando. Command of the combined NAWCTSD and NSA Orlando is held by a Naval Aviator or Naval Flight Officer in the rank of Captain, either an unrestricted line officer dual-designated as an acquisition professional, or a restricted line aeronautical engineering duty officer.

Angela Thirkell

Angela Margaret Thirkell (nee Mackail, 30 January 1890 – 29 January 1961), was an English and Australian novelist. She also published one novel, "Trooper to Southern Cross", under the pseudonym Leslie Parker.
Early life.
She was the elder daughter of John William Mackail (1859–1945), a Scottish classical scholar and civil servant from the Isle of Bute who was the Oxford professor of poetry from 1906 to 1911. Her mother was Margaret Burne-Jones, daughter of the Pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne-Jones, and through her, Thirkell was the first cousin once removed of Rudyard Kipling and Stanley Baldwin. Her brother, Denis Mackail (1892–1971), was also a novelist and they had a younger sister, Clare. The three Mackail children were, in their youth, treated first-hand to the fairytales of Mary de Morgan
Angela Mackail was educated in London at Claude Montefiore's Froebel Institute, then at St Paul's Girls' School, Hammersmith, and in Paris at a finishing school for young ladies.
Marriages and children.
Soon after her return from Paris, Angela Mackail met James Campbell McInnes (1874–1945), a professional singer, and married him in 1911. Their first son was born in January 1912 and named Graham after McInnes's former lover, Graham Peel. He became a diplomat and writer. Their second son was the novelist Colin MacInnes. A third child, Mary, was born and died in 1917, and Angela then divorced her husband for adultery, in a blaze of publicity.
In December 1918, Angela married secondly George Lancelot Allnut Thirkell (1890-c. 1940), an engineer of her own age originally from Tasmania, and in 1920 they sailed for Australia together with her sons. However, the Thirkells led a lower-middle-class life in Melbourne and to Angela it was all deeply unfamiliar and repugnant. Their son Lancelot George Thirkell, later Comptroller of the BBC, was born there, but in November 1929 Angela left her husband without warning, returning to England on the pretext of a holiday, but in fact quitting Australia for good.
Lacking money, she begged the fare to London from her godfather, J. M. Barrie, and used the sum intended for her return ticket for two single passages, for herself and her youngest son. She claimed that her parents were ageing, and needed her, but she certainly also preferred the more comfortable life available with them in London. Her second son, Colin, followed her to England soon after, but Graham stayed in Melbourne.
Thereafter, her "attitude to any man to whom she attracted was summed up in the remark: 'It's very peaceful with no husbands,'" which "was quoted by the 'Observer' newspaper in its column 'Sayings of the Week'
Writing career.
Thirkell began writing early in her life in Australia, chiefly through the need for money. An article appeared in the Cornhill Magazine in November 1921 and was the first of many articles and short stories, including work for Australian radio. On her return to England in 1929, this career continued with journalism, stories for children, and then novels. Her success as a novelist began with her second novel, "High Rising" (1933). She set most of her novels in Anthony Trollope's Barsetshire, his fictional English county developed in the six novels known as the "Chronicles of Barsetshire". An alert reader of contemporary fiction, Thirkell also borrowed freely from such now-arcane titles as John Galsworthy's "The Country House", from which, for example, she lifted the name 'Worsted' which she used for the village setting of her novel "August Folly" (1936). She also quoted frequently, and without attribution, from novels by Charles Dickens, William Thackeray, and Elizabeth Gaskell. Thirkell published a new novel every year, which she referred to in correspondence with her editor, Jamie Hamilton of Hamish Hamilton, as "new wine in an old bottle". She professed horror at the idea that her circle of well educated and upper-middle-class friends might read her fiction: she expected them to prefer, as she did, such writers as Gibbon, Austen, Dickens, and Proust. She drew the epigraph to "T 1951" from Proust: ""Les gens du monde se représentent volontiers les livres comme une espèce de cube dont une face est enlevée, si bien que l'auteur se dépêche de 'faire entrer' dedans les personnes qu'il rencontre"" ("Society people think that books are a sort of cube, one side of which the author opens the better to insert into it the people he meets.")
Her books of the 1930s in particular had a satiric exuberance, as in "Pomfret Towers", which sends up village ways, aristocratic folly and middle-class aspirations. "Three Houses" (1931, Oxford University Press; repeatedly reprinted) is a short childhood memoir which simultaneously displays Thirkell's precociously finished style, her lifelong melancholy, and her idolisation of her grandfather, Edward Burne-Jones. "Trooper to the Southern Cross" (1934; republished in 1939 as "What Happened on the Boat") "is concerned with the experiences of a number of English and Australian passengers aboard a troop-ship, the "Rudolstadt", on their way back to Australia immediately after World War I. It is particularly interesting for its depiction of the Australian 'digger'; his anti-authoritarianism, larrikinism, and, at the same time, his loyalty to those whom he respects."
In the 1940s, her work was coloured by the war and the war efforts. The home front figured particularly in "Cheerfulness Breaks In" (1940), showing how women saw their loved ones off to the front, and "Northbridge Rectory", which showed how housewives coped with the annoyances of wartime life. These books include "Marling Hall", "Growing Up" and "The Headmistress", and provide a vibrant picture of the attitude, struggle, and resigned good cheer, of British women during the war. Even a book which did not deal exclusively with the war effort, "Miss Bunting", addressed changes in society the war had wrought, as the title character, a governess, grows to middle age and wonders how to live out her life, and where her ambitions might take her as the world turns upside down. These books provide a time capsule of the age.
Later books in the 1950s became more romantic and less contemporary. Among these, "The Old Bank House" in particular shows Thirkell concerned with the rise of the merchant class, her own prejudices evident, but giving way to grudging respect for industriousness and goodhearted generosity. Later books are simpler romances. The romance "The Duke's Daughter" deals in a way more directly than some of her others with descendants of Trollope's Barsetshire characters. Her final book, "Three Score and Ten", was left unfinished at her death, but was completed later by C. A. Lejeune.
Thirkell showed a keen social sense and a lively eye for the telling detail of everyday life. Many of her books remain in print.

Kapten

Kapten (Kapteeni in Finnish) (From the Latin word "capitaneus" meaning head man or chief) is a professional and conscripted military rank in Sweden obtained by employed military personnel after one year as löjtnannt and completing a 40-week course (Note. It is no longer possible for conscripts to obtain the rank); Finland and Estonia, immediately above Löjtnant in Sweden and Yliluutnantti in Finland and just below Major in the Army ranks. In the Navy, the rank is immediately above Löjtnant and just below Örlogskapten.
Finnish Defence Forces rank of Kapteeni is comparable to Ranks of NATO armies officers as OF-2.
Obtaining the rank in Sweden.
One year as Löjtnant and a 40-week course.
History and related ranks.
Origin.
The basic military unit during the Middle Ages was the company raised by a vassal lord on behalf of his lord usually the King. The lord was commissioned by the king as Kapten to lead the unit. As the number of companies grew, one captain was granted overall (general) authority and named captain general, which was shortened to general.
Kaptenlöjtnant.
Until 1750, a rank above Löjtnant and below Kapten to command the life guard company on behalf of its formal commander - a Överste.
Stabskapten.
The rank Kaptenlöjtnant changed to Stabskapten (Staff Captain) in 1750.
Ryttmästare.
An obsolete rank in the cavalry that corresponded to Kapten.
Reform 1972.
Kapten with more than eleven years of service were elevated to Major.
Holders of the following ranks were elevated to Kapten
Reform 1972 - Rank inflation phase I.
Prior to 1972, military personnel were divided into three categories "Underbefäl" (non-commissioned officers), "Underofficerare" (warrant officers) and "Officerare" (commissioned officers). The reform established a four-career-path system with four categories as described below and carried out major promotions of most personnel below the rank Överstelöjtnant.
The "Underbefäl" category was split into two categories
The "Underofficer" category was renamed kompaniofficerare to include
The "Officer" category was renamed regementsofficerare to include
Reform 1983 - Rank inflation phase II.
All categories were merged into one professional officer category with the lowest rank set to fänrik. Furir, överfurir, sergeant and fanjunkare were removed as a professional ranks. Holders of the rank fanjunkare were promoted to löjtnant and the rest to fänrik.
Finland.
In peacetime training, a "kapteeni" is the commander of a company. (Majors can also be in this role, but usually majors work in command staff rather than in individual companies.) The rank requires additional training to obtain, in addition to the preexisting military university degree.
It is also possible for reservists to obtain the reserve rank of "kapteeni".

Sreevallabhan

'sreevallabhan/shreevallabhan' is a common name used in India for males. It is originally a Sanskrit word which is jointly formed from sree and vallabhan. Sree denotes goddess Lakshmi and vallbhan means husband, together producing the meaning husband of Lakshmi, that is lord Vishnu. Also writing it splitting as 'sree vallabhan' is too wrong as here sree stands just as a token of addressing with respect only. Also Sreevallabhan is the main God of worship of Sreevallabha Temple, Thiruvalla, Kerala, India.

<doc id="5902692" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902692" title="Broken Bow Lake">
Broken Bow Lake

Broken Bow Lake is a reservoir in southeastern Oklahoma, located on Mountain Fork River and northeast of the town of Broken Bow in McCurtain County. It is one of the largest lakes within the state of Oklahoma, and a popular tourist destination for locals and visitors from neighboring Texas and Arkansas.
The lake stretches 22 miles (35 km) back into the Ouachita Mountain country where its unusual beauty and scenic appeal beckons all sorts of nature enthusiasts. The mountain terrain is densely forested and there are many species of birds native to the area for birdwatchers to enjoy.
History.
Points of historical interest located on or near Broken Bow Lake are old Hochatown, inundated by the lake, which was settled by the Choctaw Indians in the early 1830s. Broken Bow, center of the Oklahoma timber production, was named by the Dierks brothers, pioneer lumbermen, for their original home of Broken Bow, Nebraska. The Broken Bow post office was established in 1911. Idabel, seat of McCurtain County was first named Pernell, then renamed for the daughters, Ida and Belle, of a Choctaw citizen on whose land the town was constructed. Located nearby at the site of an old Choctaw settlement is Beavers Bend Resort Park, named for John T. Beavers, a Choctaw intermarried citizen.
Development.
Broken Bow Lake was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1958 (approved July 3, 1958 (HD 170, 85th Congress, lst Session)) and another Flood Control Act (approved October 23, 1967 (SD 137, 87th Congress, 2nd Session)). The project was designed and built under the supervision of the Tulsa District of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The lake covers and has a shoreline of .
Construction began in October 1961, impoundment began in October 1968, and the conservation pool was filled in April 1970. The first power unit was put on line in January 1970, and the second unit in June 1970.
Recreation.
Hikers may enjoy two available nature trails; the Big Oak Nature Trail and the Beaver Lodge Nature Trail. The Big Oak trail is about a quarter of a mile long and is suitable for use by senior citizens and small children. The rugged and beautiful Beaver Lodge Nature Trail is a two-way trail located near the River Bend area south of the dam and winds along a clear stream through a valley surrounded by pine-covered hills.
Numerous park areas located around the lake gives visitors an excellent opportunity for outdoor family fun and relaxation. Recreational facilities include boat launching ramps, camping, picnic sites, beaches, water and sanitary facilities. There are two Oklahoma state parks nearby Broken Bow Lake; Beavers Bend Resort Park and Hochatown State Park. Cedar Creek Golf Course at Beavers Bend is another attraction close to the lake. 
The climate at Broken Bow Lake offers outdoor sportsmen excellent opportunities for year-round angling, with various species of trout and bass available.
Hunting on project lands are equally good for hunting enthusiasts, and with the exception of developed areas and certain Game Preserves, all project lands are open to the public for hunting. Deer are the most important big game species found in the area, though turkey and other sport can be found in this area.

Dick Pope, Sr.

Richard Downing Pope, Sr. (April 19, 1900 – January 28, 1988), better known as Dick Pope, was the founder of Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven, Florida. He is additionally known as "Mr. Florida" and "Mr. Water Skiing." He played a key role in the development of tourism in the state of Florida, and the growth of theme parks as tourist destinations. He was a highly accomplished athlete, and helped to popularize the sport of water skiing.
Personal life.
Dick Pope, Sr. was born in Des Moines, Iowa, according to legend during the middle of a tornado, from where he was said to have derived his whirlwind personality and energy for life. At the age of 7, in 1908, his family moved to Lake Wales, Florida.
For a while, he lived and worked in New York City. 
In 1926, while in North Carolina, he met his future wife, Julie Pope. Together they spent most of their lives in and around Winter Haven, Florida. They were active members of St. Matthew’s Catholic Church in Winter Haven. They had two children, Dick Pope, Jr. and Adrienne Pope Watkins.
During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.
Dick Pope, Sr. was known for his lively personality and his flamboyant clothing, including a turquoise suit, trimmed in pink, worn with bright white shoes.
Business career.
Dick Pope, Sr. started working in his father's real estate business at an early age. He was a natural promoter and salesman. He is said to have closed his first real estate deal when he was just 12 years old. During the Great Depression, he took different jobs working as a promoter and salesman. He and his brother had some success promoting speedboats and aquaplanes on lakes throughout Florida.
In the early 1930s, his wife Julie showed him an article in Good Housekeeping about a man charging visitors money to see the manicured gardens around his mansion home. From this, they hatched the idea of Cypress Gardens, and over the next few years they worked to convert a section of swamp land on the shores of Lake Eloise into a theme park garden. On January 2, 1936, Dick and Julie Pope officially opened their famed theme park, charging visitors 25 cents each to visit. Cypress Gardens was an immediate success.
Cypress Gardens would eventually grow to over 200 acres of land, and host more than a million visitors annually. The theme park provided visitors with an escape from the everyday world, and originally featured idyllic botanical gardens and southern belles working as hostesses. During World War II, a group of soldiers waiting to deploy to war from Tampa, Florida saw photographs of water skiers on the lake at the park, and they mistakenly believed that water ski shows were part of the entertainment offered there. When a small group soldiers arrived at the park, ready to pay the entrance fee to watch the water ski show, Julie Pope rounded up her children, Dick Jr. and Adrienne, and their friends, and staged an impromptu water skiing exhibition. It was a success, and the next weekend, 800 more soldiers arrived to see the show. From that point on, water ski shows were a staple of the Cypress Gardens brand.
Dick Pope, Sr. worked tirelessly to promote his theme park. He produced over 500 news reels and 75 short films to promote the park. In the 1970s, Cypress Gardens purchased Magnolia Mansion, the New Orleans style mansion, built on Lake Eloise by citrus magnate, John A. Snively. At its height, Cypress Gardens was nationally famous. It was used as a set location for a variety of films, including Moon Over Miami (film). An episode of the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson was filmed there. The park attracted such celebrity guests as Elvis Presley, Betty Grable, and King Hussein of Jordan.
Impact on Florida Tourism.
The impact of Dick Pope, Sr. on Florida tourism can be hardly understated. He referred to himself as the "Grand Poobah of Publicity", and through his efforts, the image of Florida as playground for sun and fun spread around the world. He is credited with single-handedly re-vitalizing Florida tourism after the difficult times of the Great Depression and World War II. Cypress Gardens helped to establish central Florida as the dominant area in the world for theme parks.
The Florida Public Relations Association (FPRA) annually gives out the Dick Pope All-Florida Grand Golden Image Award for best PR program in the state. Recent winners of the award include RB Oppenheim Associates; Jason Mudd & Associates (now Axia Public Relations); and Herrle Communications Group. The Polk County Chapter of FPRA is named after Dick Pope.
The Dick Pope Sr. Institute For Tourism Studies operates in conjunction with the University of Central Florida, conducting research into the tourism and hospitality industries.
Water Skiing.
Dick Pope, Sr. was also an avid outdoorsman and accomplished athlete. He was a member of the first class of inductees into the Water Ski Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Florida Sports Hall of Fame. 
He first became interested in water skiing during the 1920s, while working with his brother promoting and selling speed boats in Florida. He began skiing behind the boats as a way to increase excitement during the sales demonstrations. Soon, he began trying different moves and tricks to increase the excitement. In 1928, he became the first person to successfully complete a jump on water skis, jumping a wooden ramp, and going a distance of 25 ft. After water skiing became part of the Cypress Gardens' shows, he helped develop a number of different formations and tricks, including the water ski human pyramid.
Despite his amazing prowess as a water skier, his real importance to the sport of water skiing was a promoter. He produced newsreels, films, and magazine articles about water skiing, which happened to be featured at Cypress Gardens. He promoted the sport in media outlets around the world. His efforts brought the sport international attention for the first time ever.
In 1950, he hosted the second World Water Ski Championship. He hosted the event again in 1958. For many years, his Dixie Water Ski tournament was one of the most important annual water ski competitions. At the 1964 New York World's Fair, he staged a series of highly successful water skiing exhibitions. He also staged a water skiing exhibition for a segment on the Ed Sullivan Show.
He worked hard to organize water skiing as a sport. He served as the American Water Ski Association vice-president for many years, and was eventually elected to the position for life. He also helped form the World Water Ski Federation, a rival organization to the International Water Ski Union.
His son, Dick Pope, Jr., is the first person to successfully barefoot water ski, and is also a member to the Water Ski Hall of Fame. They are the only father-son pair in the Water Ski Hall of Fame.

Phantom Crash

The Phantom Crash series stands out from other Mech combat games in that it focuses very heavily on stealth tactics. Gameplay is not strictly about maneuverability and aim, but about ambush, hiding, and escape. This is largely caused by the inclusion of the ability to become invisible for a short period, which is usable by both the player and enemies.
Plot.
The game takes place in a cyberpunk setting in the year 2031. Old Tokyo is a deserted ruin, but a haven for Rumbling, a new form of televised combat sport involving mecha known in the game as SVs. The SVs are capable of wielding different weapons and abilities such as temporary invisibility thanks to AI installed in each SV. Players assume the role of a recent, nameless arrival intent on climbing the ranks of this sport who meets many characters involved in the sport along the way; each character has different sub-plots and problems that contribute to the setting providing an interesting distraction. Although unknown to the rest of the cast, the First Ranker of the sport along with her AI companion seem to notice something about the main character.
Gameplay.
The primary focus of the game is to rumble with a mech called an SV. Rumbles are large scale deathmatches which involve several SVs fighting in the same arena. Rumbles can take place in three arenas, all of which have multiple entry points for various strategies. Every in-game day, the three standard arenas will have various types of rumbles to compete in, especially rumbled which are specified for certain ranks. Much of the game requires advancement through the ranking system of rank D (lowest) through to rank A (highest), though the player has the option of jumping straight into rank A. However, with a new profile, immediately entering an A rank rumble would most likely result in immediate destruction.
In a rumble, generally after every enemy has been defeated at least once, an area ranker (equivalent to a boss) appears on the battlefield. Defeating the ranker results in defeating the rank itself. Opponents will respawn through the entry points of the battlefield after being killed, but the players will not; Once the player is destroyed by an opponent their part of the rumble is over and they will be forced to repair everything destroyed, which is generally the entire SV. To avoid repairs, players can exit the arena at any time by leaving via the entry points. NPC opponents will not leave after entering the battlefield, save for respawning after being destroyed.
There are three primary forms of SVs which can be used in rumbles. Each class has its own SVs and parts which can be purchased either from the original dealer or from a secondhand shop nearby. SVs all have a certain capacity for weight, and will become overweight and unusable if equipped with too much or too little. However, weight of various items can be changed for a very high price. There are many items to choose from, though because some of the payment system is semi-randomized, several SVs will be far more or less expensive than the actual worth of the model on any given day.
Town Map.
There exist 8 different places in the Neglected Area which can be entered. Firstly, the Hangar is used for storage of SVs, changing which music is to play during Rumbling, checking the schedule and records, and an options menu which contains the ability to save, load, keep SVs for VS Mode, and change game setting, like volume and screen adjustment.
The "Club Wired" is where the player is to go to enter Rumbling matches. There are also the options to access the ingame FAQ via the "Training" option, the same schedule+record checking, and changing the Alias of the player, for example from "Player 1" to "Player 2".
"Wild Machines" is where the player is to go for SV parts and Chips. These change every day, for example, the "Heavy Sniper Rifle" may be present one day, and the next day the "No.30 SV Gun" will take its place. The player can buy SV bodies, arm weapons, backpack weapons, SV movement features such as wheels or legs, and the purely cosmetic features which are SV colour and a sticker. There are exist 'options', such as the OCGIIIA, which it or its counterparts can be used to provide OC (Optic Camouflage). SV parts and Chips can also be sold if no longer needed, for exactly half of their buying price.
The player can also buy readily made SVs, with a body, movement system, Chip and at least one weapon. The names of the SVs in the store also somehow describe them. "HLPARTS" stands for 'Holy Parts' and denotation of the SV will show it has the very basic requirements. Some SVs are fully built, but their names tell details about them. 'NOSUREPH' stands for 'Not Sure Photon' and the name reads the SV, its not that useful, with usually no powerful weapons such as tank cannons. 'OKAYAR' stands for 'Okay Aeron' and these are a cut above their 'NOSURE' counterparts. Then, there are 'TODAYHL' and others. These are another cut above, this time superior to the 'OKAY' SVs, those they can cost a large amount, in the case of the pink 'TODAYPH' costing far over a million New Yen. The 'OKAY' and 'TODAY' SVs are much rarer than the other 2. All of these can be of all SV types, so 'TODAYHL', 'TODAYPH' and 'TODAYAR' all exist. There are also 3 varieties of the rarer ready-made SVs. The "Wild Machines" store is run by Atsorou, who also is the A Ranker for Shinjuku Day and Night games and also the Area Ranker up to a certain point in the game.
"PlusTech" is run by Greek, and his Wolf type Chip Mikonos. There, you are able to Uplift Chips, essentially leveling them up to improve performance. Also, modules can be given a 'Light' or 'Heavy' upgrade. For example, the "Auto Grenader" is usually lightened to increase blast radius, and movement modules given a 'heavy' upgrade in order to increase weight capacity.
Soundtrack.
The game has a large soundtrack of both real-world music and songs composed for the game by Kyo Ichinose. Most songs are available from the in-game music store, Sonic Amp, and song settings can be changed from the Garage.
Reception.
Although sales were fairly poor, the game has a small cult following. The game is translated from the original Japanese. Most in-game conversations have relatively good spelling; however many item names suffer from "Engrish". The primary example is the case of "apple" being spelled "aple" and "ample" in various cases of stickers. Also, "Odessey" in the Tokyo Bay night-time regulation, "2031 Odessey".
Xbox Backwards Compatibility.
It has been found to be highly incompatible with the Xbox 360. Scratches on the game disk make the game somewhat or entirely unplayable, as well as having serious slow down issues and several cases of the game freezing. The framerate is low and Microsoft will most likely not release updates for this game, due to low sales.
Phantom Crash has been tested on both the Xbox and Xbox 360, and it has been found in few cases that the game will only suffer in frame rate on the Xbox 360 where it would with the standard Xbox. There have not been several cases of crashing, and the game runs significantly better on the Xbox hard drive. However, most cases will still have significant problems with the game if played in the Xbox 360.
All levels, except area ranker fights and trial mode for a scoobee lag, even if the disc used is brand-new, with no scratches. Slowdown is most common during large-scale battles involving three or more SVs battling, and lag is most common in night-time battles. Slowdown is also most common on the Tokyo Bay field. Unfortunately, it will still run slowly unless Microsoft releases a better emulator.
For those having Xbox 360 compatibility issues, setting the display to 480p and the widescreen settings to normal can stop most of the crashes, though lag remains almost constant in crowded matches. Also having the Xbox level instead of upright seemed to help, strange as it seems. This solution is not 100% but it makes the game far more playable on a 360.

<doc id="5902728" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902728" title="E85 in the United States">
E85 in the United States

E85 is an abbreviation for an ethanol fuel blend of up to 85% denatured ethanol fuel and gasoline or other hydrocarbon (HC) by volume.
Availability.
The number of stations in the United States that sell E85 is constantly increasing, as station owners either add new E85 tanks or convert existing tanks and pumps. One database that encourages users to submit station locations and prices is called http://e85prices.com [http://E85prices.com.] and lists, as of January 2014, nearly 3,300 stations carrying the fuel in the United States.
NOTES:
Minnesota has the largest number of E85 fuel locations of any U.S. state with close to 350 stations, while Illinois has the second-greatest number of E85 pumps with about 160. Although Minnesota has the most E85 pumps they only represent a tiny fraction of the total fuel outlets. According to Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) there are approximately 140,000 publicly accessible retail gasoline stations in the United States.
Constraints.
Concerns about rising gasoline prices and energy dependence have led to a resurgence of interest in E85 fuel; for example, Nebraska mandated the use of E85 in state vehicles whenever possible in May 2005. Similarly, whereas selling any fuel containing more than 10% ethanol is still currently illegal in some states, even this is rapidly changing. For example, Florida proposed changing state law to permit the sale of alternative fuels such as E85 at an October 7, 2005 meeting, and held public hearings on October 24. The expected outcome of having held this hearing is the changing of Florida state law to permit the selling of alternative fuels such as E85 by the end of 2005 to the general public. (At that time, only county, state, and Federal fleet vehicles could purchase E85 in Florida, from only 3 pumps in the state.) Several other states have similar laws still on their books that prevent the sale of E85 to the general public. The expected general outcome, though, is the rapidly widening acceptance of E85 sales to the general public in all of the United States by the end of 2006.
Federal use.
US Federal fleet flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) are required to operate on alternative fuels 100% of the time upon the signing of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 into law by President Bush on August 8, 2005. (See Section 701 for this requirement.) Formerly, such FFVs were required to be operated by the end of 2005 on alternative fuels only 51% of the time (i.e., the majority of the time) by Executive Order 13149. (See Executive Order 13149, dated April 21, 2000.) This means that the US Government's use of E85 is effectively doubled as of August 8, 2005 with the signing into law of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. This jump in consumption had the effect of limiting public availability of E85 coincident with shortages of gasoline due to impacts of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico during the 2005 hurricane season. Although the price of corn had not changed greatly, the usage of E85 nonetheless jumped, thereby creating a shortage of E85, and causing E85 prices to rise coincident with gasoline prices during the 2005 Hurricane Season.
Price.
, E85 is frequently sold for up to 36% lower price per quantity than gasoline. Much of this discount can be attributed to various government subsidies, and, at least in the United States, the elimination of state taxes that typically apply to gasoline and can amount to 47 cents, or more, per gallon of fuel. The US federal tax exemption that keeps ethanol economically competitive with petroleum fuel products is due to expire in 2007, but this exemption may be extended through legislative action. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the price of E85 rose to nearly on par with the cost of 87 octane gasoline in many states in the United States, and was for a short time the only fuel available when gasoline was sold out, but within four weeks of Katrina, the price of E85 had fallen once more to a 20% to 35% lower cost than 87 octane gasoline.
Vehicles.
For the 2009 automobile year, General Motors will offer 23 different engine/model Flex Fuel vehicle combinations. Ford Motor company offers eight models, Chrysler will offer 11 models, and Toyota will offer just two. Daimler (Mercedes-Benz) has one model (C300) as well, and is probably the only one amongst the luxury car makers.
In US, Honda does not offer any E85 powered flexfuel vehicles in 2009.
GM has stated a commitment to dedicate 50% of its production to Flex-Fuel E85 capable vehicles by the 2012 model year. Also by 2012 all products of British luxury car-maker Bentley Motors will be Flex-Fuel using a patented fuel-system and an in-line fuel sensor.
As of 2008, there were an estimated 7 million Flex-Fuel capable vehicles on the road in the United States. A recent GM study found that roughly 70 percent of its flex-fuel vehicle owners did not know they could use E85, and fewer than 10 percent did so.
Since 2012, the IndyCar Series has utilized E85.
E85 and the 2006 Minnesota Governor's race.
In the 2006 election for Minnesota Governor, the issue of E85 may have helped re-elect Republican Tim Pawlenty. In the final week of the campaign, DFL Lieutenant Governor candidate Judi Dutcher was stumping for her running mate Mike Hatch. A reporter asked Dutcher what Hatch's stance on E85 was and Dutcher appeared to be unfamiliar with E85. As Hatch tried to cover up Dutcher's gaffe, he became angry with reporters which many people think led to a lack of support and Pawlenty's re-election in an election year when Republicans did not fare well as a group.

National Museum of Finland

The National Museum of Finland (, ) presents Finnish history from the Stone Age to the present day, through objects and cultural history. The Finnish National Romantic style building is located in central Helsinki and operates in collaboration with the National Board of Antiquities (, ), an association related to the government's Ministry of Culture and Education.
Exhibitions.
The permanent exhibitions of the National Museum are divided into six parts. The Treasure Troves presents the collections of coins, medals, orders and decorations, silver, jewellery and weapons.
Prehistory of Finland is the largest permanent archeological exhibition in Finland.
The Realm presents of the development of Finnish society and culture from the Middle Ages 12th century to the early 20th century, through the Swedish Kingdom Period to the Russian Empire Era. The "Land and Its People" presents Finnish folk culture in the 18th and 19th centuries, life in the countryside before the industrialisation.
New permanent exhibition on 20th century Finland and Finns called "Suomi Finland 1900" was opened 26 April 2012.
VINTTI Workshop - Easy History, is an interactive exhibition, where visitors can study the history of Finland and its culture using their hands and brains. It is based on experimentation and personal experience, and the tasks and assignments also point the way to exploring the permanent exhibitions of the museum.
The museum collections include also the Mesa Verde artifacts from the cliff dwellings of Colorado. These were dedicated to the museum by the Swedish-speaking Finnish explorer Gustaf Nordenskiöld. They comprise the most-extensive collection of Mesa Verde items outside the United States and one of the largest collections of native Americana outside the American continents.
These artifacts were on display until 19 May 2013 in the Museum of Cultures, in Tennispalatsi address: Eteläinen Rautatiekatu 8, Helsinki.
The museum's entrance hall ceiling has ceiling frescoes about the Kalevala, painted by Akseli Gallén-Kallela, which can be seen without an entrance fee. The frescoes, painted in 1928, are based on the frescoes painted by Gallén-Kallela in the Finnish Pavilion of the Paris World Fair in 1900.
The building of the National Museum was designed by architects Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren, and Eliel Saarinen. The appearance of the building reflects Finland's medieval churches and castles. The architecture belongs to national romanticism and the interior mainly to art nouveau. The museum was built from 1905 to 1910 and opened to the public in 1916. The museum was named the Finnish National Museum after Finland's independence in 1917. After the last thorough renovation, the museum was re-opened in 2000.
Gas explosion in the Silver Room 2006.
On Monday 23 January 2006 there was an explosion accident at the National Museum in the Silver Room, which was probably caused by methane leaking into a broom cupboard and lit by a spark from the electrical mains in the closet. There were two possible sources for the methane; a leak from a gas pipe under the nearby Museokatu street, or gas that developed on its own in the sewer. 
Later, police investigations found the cause to be a gas pipe leak [http://www.hs.fi/uutiset/tuoreet/artikkeli/Kansallismuseon+r%C3%A4j%C3%A4hdyksen+syyn%C3%A4+maakaasuvuoto/1135218807492]. Most display cases and some silver objects in the museum's Silver Room were damaged in the explosion, although most of them only mildly. All objects have been repaired during 2006. The Silver Room was re-opened to the public in early 2007.

Garret Mountain Reservation

Garret Mountain Reservation is 568 acre (2.3 km2) park located in southern Passaic County, New Jersey, United States and one of several National Natural Landmarks in New Jersey. Most of it is located within the Borough of Woodland Park (formerly West Paterson), although it also extends into the cities of Paterson and Clifton.
The reservation covers the northernmost part of the First Watchung Mountain and reaches over 500 feet (152 m) above sea level.
The Passaic County Parks Department operates the park while the Passaic County Sheriff is responsible for law enforcement in the reservation.
It is easily accessible from both Interstate 80 and the Garden State Parkway (via Route 19) as well as the local roads.
Garret Mountain Reservation is the county's major recreational area, providing the visitors with grass fields, several miles of walking/running trails, basketball courts, picnic areas, Barbour's Pond is state stocked with fish for anglers, as well as an Equestrian Center with horseback riding lessons. Since the park is an oasis of woodland surrounded by urbanity, Garret Mountain is a migrant trap for migrating song birds, including 35 species of Warblers, numerous Vireos, Orioles, Sparrows and Thrushes. Birdwatchers from the Tri-state areas flock to this hotspot for great views of 150+ species per year along the easily accessible trails.
Lambert Castle, located on the eastern slope of the mountain, just off Route 19, is a 19th-century castle which has been recently renovated and now hosts the Passaic County Museum (open to the public). The Morris Canal once passed two tenths of a mile east of the castle.
For the past several decades, the reservation has been the site of hundreds of high school and college cross country meets in the fall, including the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) High School State Sectional Championships at the end of every October.

<doc id="5902925" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5902925" title="Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics">
Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics

Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE), commonly known as Gokhale Institute, is one of the oldest research and training institutes in Economics in India. It is located on BMCC Road in the Deccan Gymkhana area of Pune, Maharashtra – the city often termed as the Oxford of the East.
History.
The Institute was founded on June 6, 1930 by R. R. Kale as a centre for research and higher learning in economics. The Institute was founded with an endowment offered to the Servants of India Society by Shri R R Kale. The Servants of India Society, a registered body founded by the nationalist leader Gopal Krishna Gokhale, are the trustees of the Institute. The Institute is registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950.
The Institute was set up with an objective to conduct research on the economic and political problems of India and to train research workers in these disciplines. D. R. Gadgil was the first Director of the Institute.
Research.
The major research areas of the Institute, developed over the years through financial assistance from various sources, are: Agricultural Economics, Population Studies, Economic History, Input-output analysis for planning and development, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Monetary economics, Financial Economics, Public Economics, International Economics and the study of economics of East European countries.
In the early years, the research activities were financed through assistance from various ministries and public funding agencies including the Government of Maharashtra and private foundations like the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. In 1954, the Union Ministry of Food and Agriculture established the Agro-Economic Research Centre of the Institute. During the early fifties, the Rockefeller Foundation made a substantial grant, spread over years, for the conduct of a research programme in rural demography. The Union Ministry of Health also gave grants for conducting some specific demographic studies in 1954-57; and in 1964, the Ministry decided to strengthen and expand the research work on population by financing on a continuing basis a Population Research Centre as an integral part of the Institute. Ford Foundation gave a very generous financial assistance for more than a decade beginning with the year 1956. Later on, the Ford Foundation, in co-operation with the Planning Commission, provided a separate grant for research and training in the areas of planning and development, mainly devoted to input-output studies. In 1962, the University Grants Commission recognised the Institute as a Centre of Advanced Study in Agricultural Economics to start with and later, in 1964, as a Centre of Advanced Study in Economics. In 1977, the UGC, as a part of its Area Studies Programme, established at the Institute a Centre of Study of Economics of East European Countries. In the same year, the Reserve Bank of India instituted a Chair in Finance at the Institute.
Teaching.
Although GIPE was primarily a research institute, it was recognized as an institution for higher learning in the field of economics, and it awarded MA, MPhil and PhD degrees in Economics under recognition from the University of Bombay from 1930 to 1949. With the establishment of the University of Pune in 1949, GIPE became a constituent recognized institution of the University of Pune until 1993. Keeping in view its professional standing and scope for further development, the Government of India, on recommendation of the University Grants Commission, declared GIPE as ‘Deemed University’ from May 9, 1993. With the grant of this status, the Institute now awards its own MA, MPhil and PhD degrees in economics. The Deemed University status allows the syllabi to be updated regularly in line with the domestic and international developments in Economics and related fields. The Institute was accredited it with A+ (grade) (score 90-95%) for a period of five years by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council on, and with effect from January 8, 2004.
Academic Programmes.
The mainstay of the Institute is its MA Programme in Economics, which is acknowledged as one of the best in the country. Though the Institute offered the M Phil Programme for about a decade (1978–89), it discontinued the same, perhaps to devote better attention to the MA Programme and the research projects. The PhD Programme, started right from the inception of the Institute, still continues with a highly selective intake and hence a limited output. Several batches of students have been awarded the MA degrees and more than 165 students have obtained their doctoral degrees in different branches of economics since the inception of the Institute. 
The goal of the Institute —to conduct research into the economic and political problems of India and train research workers in these subjects— has been reconceptualised over years so as to confine the activities of the Institute to teaching and research in Economics alone, leaving aside the political problems of India. However, the applied and empirical research into Indian economic problems and policy evaluations indirectly encompass the political dimensions as well. 
The curricular content of the ongoing MA Economics Programme offers a blend of core and applied optional courses. The student-faculty ratio is 3:1 for the MA Programme. 
The Institute offers an option of undertaking a Master’s Thesis as one of its subject credits. Thesis course at the MA level is unique to the Institute; established with an aim to sharpen the research skills of students and enabling them to put their theoretical knowledge to practical use. The Institute also provides a one-year diploma computer programme to provide training on various econometric packages.
Publications.
The Institute publishes a quarterly journal of economics in English, Artha Vijnana, the first publication of which was made in March 1959. This journal publishes results of research work carried out in the Institute as well as works of scholars from outside the Institute after a refereeing process. The Institute also publishes research works in the form of books and mimeograph series. The Kale Memorial Lecture, organised by the Institute every year on the occasion of the Founder's Day, is published under the Kale Memorial Lecture Series. Over 70 lectures have been delivered under this Lecture Series, and the list of speakers includes such prominent figures as: B R Ambedkar, John Mathai, P C Mahalanobis, V.K.R.V. Rao, K N Raj, V M Dandekar, I G Patel, Andre Beteille, Manmohan Singh, Amresh Bagchi, Jagdish Bhagwati, C Rangarajan and A P J Abdul Kalam. All the Kale Memorial Lectures delivered at the Gokhale Institute are published, and most of the Lectures' Text can be found on JSTOR (Journal Storage - an online archive for academic journals made available to researchers through participating libraries and institutions). 
This is a List of Kale Memorial Lectures held at Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics since 1937 . 
Campus.
The Institute has a serene and beautiful campus of and is located in the urban setting of Pune in Deccan Gymkhana area. The residential campus of the Institute comprising faculty and staff houses, guest houses, and the student dormitories, is built on a separate plot of , a few metres away from the Institute. There are two hostels, one for boys and another for girls. Adequate hostel accommodation is available for the existing students. The girls’ hostel was designed by the famous architect and urban planner Christopher Charles Benninger during 1996-1998. 
The Institute campus is a mélange of old and new buildings spread over a large and lush green area. It provides just the right sylvan, solitary and peaceful setting required for learning and researching. After having undergone a recent landscaping, the campus attracts many a visitors as well. The campus consists of an academic block, faculty block, administration block, seminar hall and the Dhananjaya Rao Gadgil Library. There is a conference hall, known as Kale Memorial Hall, on the top floor of the Library which is used by the Institute and also let out to others on rent. The austere and majestic buildings radiate the old charm characteristic of the Pune city. On the Fergusson Hill behind the Institute lies the spot where Gokhale took the vows of the Servants of India Society – poverty, obedience, and service to nation - and administered them to three others. It has become a landmark because of the erection of a column there. Gokhale’s bungalow still stands in the precincts of the campus. A massive and graceful banyan tree adds to the charm of the place. This is said to be the tree under which Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Mahatma Gandhi (who regarded Gokhale as his political guru) used to muse over political issues in their times. The residential campus of the GIPE too, is set in the midst of lush greenery and gives the place a uniquely quaint contour, especially in the rains.
Library.
The Dhananjaya Rao Gadgil Library was established in 1905 as a public library under the aegis of Servants of India Society with late Gopal Krishna Gokhale as one of its founding members. With the establishment of GIPE in 1930, the Library has started to act as the library of the Institute. Presently the Library is housed in a majestic four-storey building, which is a rare combination of colonial and modern architecture. Besides, some of the Library collections are also housed in a separate building inside the campus of the Institute. 
The Library has one of the largest collections of social science documents in India. The total collection exceeds 2.5 lakhs of books and 470 national and international journals. It has a large number of publications on Economics and all allied social science subjects and successfully caters to the needs of scholars, academicians, policy makers and other users working in social science subjects in India and abroad. Though attached to GIPE, the library extends membership to outsiders also and thereby performs the dual function of an academic and a public library as well.
The Library is a depository library of the publications of the United Nations and its agencies, the World Bank, the European Economic Community, the International Monetary Fund, and the Government of Canada. The Library possesses quite a large number of rare books published before the advent of twentieth century and which may not be available elsewhere. The oldest book in the Library dates back to 1680. Besides, there are quite a few hundred books which were published during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Jean-Joël Perrier-Doumbé

Jean-Joël Perrier-Doumbé (born 27 September 1978 in Paris) is a French-born Cameroonian former footballer.
Club career.
Early career.
Perrier-Doumbé started his career at Auxerre, making over 50 first-team appearances before moving to Rennes in 2004. He quickly became a first-team regular at the Stade de la Route de Lorient, making 27 appearances in Ligue 1 in the 2005–06 season.
However, the Cameroon international found first team opportunities limited during the first half of the 2006–07 campaign after missing the opening stages of the season due to an arm injury sustained in a pre-season friendly. The arrival of Dutch defender Mario Melchiot provided strong competition for the right-back berth and Perrier-Doumbé was linked with moves away.
Loan spell with Celtic.
On 12 January 2007, it was reported that Perrier-Doumbé had been on trial with Celtic, while Premier League side Bolton Wanderers were also credited with an interest. On 25 January, it was confirmed that Perrier-Doumbé would join Celtic, initially on loan until the end of the season, with an option to sign for an additional two years after the completion of the loan.
On arrival at Celtic, Perrier-Doumbé found first team opportunities limited and began as a reserve team player. However, injuries to Mark Wilson and Gary Caldwell gave the Cameroonian a chance and he made his way into the first team, although not until after Celtic had already won the league. He scored the winning goal in the Scottish Cup final against Dunfermline Athletic on 26 May 2007, his first senior goal in club football.
In July 2007, after his contract with Rennes expired, it was reported that Perrier-Doumbé was in talks with Sheffield United on the recommendation of Celtic manager Gordon Strachan after he had refused to pay a fee for Perrier-Doumbé. Celtic were expected to sign him on a three-year deal but, due to a clause in the loan contract, the club would have had to pay £400,000; any other club was available to sign him for free.
However, after playing for the Blades in a pre-season friendly against Alfreton Town, manager Bryan Robson decided to not to offer him a contract.
Permanent deal with Celtic.
On 11 August 2007, Perrier-Doumbé signed for Celtic until the end of the season. Perrier-Doumbé tore his achilles tendon during a Champions League match against Milan on 3 October and was sidelined for nearly six months. He made his comeback for the Celtic reserve team against Gretna on 24 March 2008. Whilst out injured, the club honoured him with a year's extension on his contract, tying him up until the end of the 2008–09 season.
Toulouse.
On 7 October 2009, Perrier-Doumbé returned to France and signed a two-year deal with Toulouse. He left the club in 2011.

British Camp

The British Camp is an Iron Age hill fort located at the top of Herefordshire Beacon in the Malvern Hills. The hillfort is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is owned and maintained by Malvern Hills Conservators. The fort is thought to have been first constructed in the 2nd century BC. A Norman castle was built on the site.
The extensive earthworks remain clearly visible today and determine the shape of the hill.
The height of the summit of British Camp is 1,110 feet.
Situation.
The British Camp is composed of extensive earthworks that have been compared to a giant wedding cake. Midsummer Hillfort is a mile south of the British Camp. There are a number of generally round hut platforms on the British Camp, which may well suggest a permanent occupation. However it is unusual to have two major hillforts within such a short distance.
The diarist John Evelyn (1620–1706) remarked that the view from the hill was "one of the godliest vistas in England".
British Camp.
The ditch and counterscarp bank around the entire site covers three hills, although those to north and south are little more than spurs. With a perimeter of , the defences enclose an area of around . The first earthworks were around the base of the central hill otherwise known as the citadel. At least four pre-historic phases of building have so far been identified. Original gates appear to have existed to east, west and north-east.
The Roman Era.
There is no evidence about whether the coming of the Romans ended the prehistoric use of the British Camp, but folklore states that the ancient British chieftain Caractacus made his last stand here. This is unlikely, according to the description of the Roman historian Tacitus who implies a site closer to the river Severn. Excavation at Midsummer Hill fort, Bredon Hill and Croft Ambrey all show evidence of violent destruction around 48 AD. This may suggest that the British Camp was abandoned or destroyed around the same time.
The Castle.
Medieval castles were sometimes built within earlier sites, reusing the earthworks of Iron Age hill forts for instance as was the case at British Camp. A ringwork and bailey castle, known as Colwall Castle as well as The Herefordshire Beacon, was built within the Iron Age hill fort, probably in the ten years immediately before 1066. Quite possibly the builder was Earl Harold Godwinson, the future King Harold II of England. Earl Harold is recorded as building another fortress in the county at Longtown Castle. The castle would appear to have been refortified during The Anarchy of the reign of King Stephen. Before 1148 the fortress was held by Waleran de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Worcester. The castle appears to have changed hands again in 1151 and 1153 when attacked by royalists. At this time it was defended by the men of Earl Waleran's brother, Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester. The castle was finally destroyed by King Henry II in 1155 and mentioned in passing by William Langland before 1386.
The Shire Ditch.
The Shire Ditch, or Red Earl's Dyke, runs north and south of the British Camp along the ridge of the hills. It was created in 1287 by Gilbert de Clare, the Earl of Gloucester, following a boundary dispute with Thomas de Cantilupe, the Bishop of Hereford. Recent research has shown that the Shire Ditch might actually be much older. Indeed there is some evidence that it may have started life as a prehistoric trackway running from Midsummer Hill fort to the Worcestershire Beacon, the highest hill in the range over three miles to the north of the Camp.
Folklore.
A popular legend tells that Caractacus, a British tribal chieftain, fought his last battle against the Romans at the British Camp and goes on to say that after his capture he was taken to Rome where he was given a villa and a pension by Emperor Claudius.
However, the description by Tacitus, the Roman historian makes this unlikely:
Although the River Severn is visible from British Camp, it is about from it, so this battle must have taken place elsewhere. A number of locations have been suggested, including sites near Brampton Bryan, an important Roman site, or Church Stretton which also has an Iron Age fort on Caer Caradoc Hill.

Elasticity of a function

In mathematics, the elasticity or point elasticity of a positive differentiable function "f" of a positive variable (positive input, positive output) at point "a" is defined as
or equivalently
It is thus the ratio of the relative (percentage) change in the function's output formula_4 with respect to the relative change in its input formula_5, for infinitesimal changes from a point formula_6. Equivalently, it is the ratio of the infinitesimal change of the logarithm of a function with respect to the infinitesimal change of the logarithm of the argument.
The elasticity of a function is a constant formula_7 if and only if the function has the form formula_8 for a constant formula_9.
The elasticity at a point is the limit of the arc elasticity between two points as the separation between those two points approaches zero.
The concept of elasticity is widely used in economics; see elasticity (economics) for details.
Rules.
Rules for finding the elasticity of products and quotients are simpler than those for derivatives. Let "f, g" be differentiable. Then
The derivative can be expressed in terms of elasticity as
Let "a" and "b" be constants. Then
Estimating point elasticities.
In economics, the price elasticity of demand refers to the elasticity of a demand function "Q"("P"), and can be expressed as (dQ/dP)/(Q(P)/P) or the ratio of the value of the marginal function (dQ/dP) to the value of the average function (Q(P)/P). This relationship provides an easy way of determining whether a demand curve is elastic or inelastic at a particular point. First, suppose one follows the usual convention in mathematics of plotting the independent variable (P) horizontally and the dependent variable (Q) vertically. Then the slope of a line tangent to the curve at that point is the value of the marginal function at that point. The slope of a ray drawn from the origin through the point is the value of the average function. If the absolute value of the slope of the tangent is greater than the slope of the ray then the function is elastic at the point; if the slope of the secant is greater than the absolute value of the slope of the tangent then the curve is inelastic at the point. If the tangent line is extended to the horizontal axis the problem is simply a matter of comparing angles formed by the lines and the horizontal axis. If the marginal angle is greater than the average angle then the function is elastic at the point; if the marginal angle is less than the average angle then the function is inelastic at that point. If, however, one follows the convention adopted by economists and plots the independent variable "P" on the vertical axis and the dependent variable "Q" on the horizontal axis, then the opposite rules would apply.
The same graphical procedure can also be applied to a supply function or other functions.
Semi-elasticity.
A semi-elasticity (or semielasticity) gives the percentage change in "f(x)" in terms of a change (not percentage-wise) of "x". Algebraically, the semi-elasticity S of a function "f" at point "x" is 
An example of semi-elasticity is modified duration in bond trading.
The term "semi-elasticity" is also sometimes used for the change if "f(x)" in terms of a percentage change in "x" which would be

Henry Playfair

Henry Playfair (born 22 January 1983) is an Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League. Playfair grew up and around the town of Holbrook in the Riverina region of New South Wales.
Career.
Drafted by the Geelong Cats in the 2001 AFL Draft at pick number 41, he debuted in Round 15 of the 2003 season at Telstra Dome. He was one of Geelong's main players in the 2005 AFL season, however a series of injuries hampered his performance in 2006. He was a key forward who also played the positions of back and ruck. 
Playfair was an integral part of the Cats 2007 VFL premiership team, along with players such as Charlie Gardiner, Brent Prismall and Tom Lonergan.
Due to a lack of opportunities, and moving into the prime of his career, Playfair asked to be traded to the Sydney Swans in 2008 and was traded in exchange for a third round draft pick. He moved back to his home state in an attempt to get more AFL playing opportunities.
Sydney delisted Playfair on 13 November 2009 and then redrafted him as a mature age rookie with their first pick (pick 10) in the Rookie Draft on 15 December 2009.
Retirement.
After suffering a serious back injury in the Round 14 match against Richmond at the SCG, and after medical advice Playfair decided to call an end to his career.
Playfair said “When I found out I’d done some damage to my back it was a bit of a shock. At first I didn’t know what it meant for my season, and then I spoke further to the doctor and the physio and it looked like my season was over, I then had to make a decision about next year, and coming off the troubles I’ve had previously with hamstring injuries over the past couple of seasons, the back was another indication that my body is not up to it at this stage.’’
Personal life.
Playfair previously had a fitness business, Fitness By Cats, with former teammates Corey Enright and Brent Prismall. All three are accredited personal trainers.

Times Higher Education

The Times Higher Education (THE), formerly the Times Higher Education Supplement (THES), is a weekly magazine based in London, reporting specifically on news and issues related to higher education. It is the United Kingdom's leading publication in this field.
Publication history.
From its first issue, in 1971, until 2008 the "Times Higher Education Supplement"' ("THES") was published in newspaper format. On 10 January 2008 it was relaunched as a magazine. It is published by TSL Education Ltd, which until October 2005 was a division of News International.
The magazine is currently edited by John Gill. Phil Baty is the editor at large, and is responsible for international coverage. He is also the editor of the magazine's World University Rankings.
The magazine features a fictional satirical column written by Laurie Taylor, the "Poppletonian", which reflects on life at the fictional Poppleton University.
In 2011 "Times Higher Education" was awarded the titles of "Weekly Business Magazine of the Year" and "Media Business Brand of the Year" by the Professional Publishers Association.
"Times Higher Education" World University Rankings.
"Times Higher Education" has become known for publishing the annual "Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings", which first appeared in November 2004.
On 30 October 2009 "Times Higher Education" broke with QS, then its partner in compiling the Rankings, and signed an agreement with Thomson Reuters to provide the data instead. The magazine developed a new methodology in consultation with its readers and its editorial board. Thomson Reuters collects and analyses the data used to produce the rankings on behalf of "Times Higher Education". The results have been published annually since autumn 2010. QS, which collected and analysed the rankings data for the past six years, no longer has any involvement with "Times Higher Education"’s World University Rankings.
Awards.
The magazine runs two sets of awards annually.
The first is the ""Times Higher Education" Awards". The 2011 awards took place on 24 November at the Grosvenor House Hotel on London's Park Lane and received a record number of entries across the 18 categories. Seventeen universities were given awards in different categories, with the University of Sheffield being "University of the Year". Tessa Blackstone was given the "Lord Dearing Lifetime Achievement Award".
The University of Strathclyde was named as the University of the Year at the 2012 awards which took place on 29 November 2012 at the Grosvenor House Hotel on London's Park Lane. University of Strathclyde Principal and Vice-Chancellor Professor Sir Jim McDonald received the award at the ceremony. 
The ""Times Higher Education" Leadership and Management Awards" (Thelmas) were launched in 2009. The Thelmas were set up to recognise the impact that administrative staff have on the success of higher education institutions.

François Miron

François Miron (born 1962) is a French-Canadian experimental filmmaker also working in documentary and fiction.
Early life.
Miron was born in Montreal in 1962. 
Education.
He obtained a BFA from Concordia University in 1987 and an MFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990 ( He received a full merit scholarship )
Film Description.
His early body of work consist of found footage manipulation through optical printing and abstract cinematography of industrial landscapes, his abstract work has lately been shifting into more "traditional" narrative cinema and documentary, although a strong psychedelic and surreal influence still is present. Most of his films have been exhibited worldwide and have won awards.
His early films are in the tradition of Pat O'Neill who was the pioneer of experimental optical printing films in the 60's and 70's and is still active to this day. Other links have been made to Paul Sharits, Stan Brakhage, Norman McLaren and in painting to Jackson Pollock
Selected works.
At the original screening of the film at The World Film Festival, the sound was so loud that the projection booth window broke, the projectionist stopped the projection but the judges insisted that they see the film again, documentary filmmaker Peter Wintonick wrote an article about this in Cinema Canada he also interviewed Miron about his filmmaking activities (the magazine was defunct in 1989) The Consevatoire D’Art Cinematographique in Montreal requested that the film be put in their archives, there is also a print at The Canadian Film Archives in Ottawa. 
Aside from those, Miron has created over 15 films since 1982.
A DVD Anthology of his work was released in 2010 and has received worldwide but limited distribution. It is distributed in Canada by The CFMDC (along with some of the original prints of his films) and RE-VOIR in Europe.
In 2003 he was ranked 4th best filmmaker of Montreal by The Montreal Mirror 14th annual reader's poll
In 2008 he won a Juno Award for his photographic work on the cover of the Arcade Fire CD: Neon Bible.
Since 2007, he has been working on a feature length documentary about legendary Avant-Garde filmmaker Paul Sharits to be completed late 2014
Teachings.
Since 1993, François Miron has been teaching at The Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema at Concordia University in Montreal, there he created a legendary optical printing course, many students were exposed to this art form for the first time and had their artistic vision completely changed and became somewhat notable experimental filmmakers themselves.
With the rise of new technologies and the near death of celluloid based film, after a near 20 year run, the course disappeared in 2012
Miron is still very active as a teacher, teaching basic filmmaking and also advanced cinematography among other courses.

PBA Commissioner's Cup

The PBA Commissioner's Cup is a tournament of the Philippine Basketball Association. The tournament require teams to hire a single import. The event was the league's second conference from 1993 to 2002. However, in 2003, the tournament was scrapped and was replaced by an Invitational tournament. The tournament was revived in 2011 after the league re-adopted the three conference format.
The "Commissioner's Cup" also refers to the trophy awarded to the champion team.
History.
During the 1993 PBA season, the league moved the All-Filipino Conference as the first tournament of the season and made the Second Conference as the Commissioner's Cup, a reference to the PBA Commissioner. The conference was the second tournament held in a PBA season.
The Swift/Sunkist franchise won the tournament in 1993 and 1995. Purefoods, with Kenny Redfield as import and Chot Reyes as head coach, defeated Alaska in 1994.
During Alaska's grandslam season of 1996, they won the Commissioners Cup title over Shell in a grueling seven-game series. The Gordon's Gin Boars ended their six year drought, winning over the Milkmen in 1997, giving playing coach Robert Jaworski his last PBA title on both capacities. A year later, Alaska had Devin Davis as import to win the title over San Miguel.
From 1999-2000, San Miguel won the Commissioners Cup with Terquin Mott and Stephen Howard as imports. But in 2001, the Beermen was upset by the Red Bull Thunder, with Best Import Antonio Lang in six games.
In 2002, with most of the team's star players are with the national squad, the PBA once again allowed team's to take two imports with a 12-feet maximum height limit. Red Bull won the series over Talk 'N Text in seven games.
The tournament was retired in 2003 after the re-introduction of the Invitational Championship as the second conference of the season but was eventually reactivated in 2011 after the league restored the three-conference season format.
Tournament format.
From 1993 to 1997, the teams were divided to two groups in the elimination round. The teams in the same group will play against each other once and against teams in the other group twice. After the eliminations, the top five teams will advance to a double-round robin semifinals. A playoff incentive will be given to a team that will win five of their eight semifinal games should they fail to get the top two finals berths. The top two teams (or the #1 team and the winner of the playoff between team with at least 5 semifinal wins and the #2 team) will face each other in a best-of-seven championship series. In 1995, a slightly modified post eliminations format was adopted. Instead, the top six teams will advance to the quarterfinal round for another single round robin. The top four team will then be seeded in a best-of-five series with the winners advancing to the finals.
In 1998, the league adopted a quarterfinal-semifinal playoff format with the top two seeds advancing automatically to the semifinals and the next four teams will be matched up in the quarterfinals. The winners will advance to the semifinal round and to compete against the two top seeded teams in a best-of-five series. The winners of the semifinal round will then advance to the best-of-seven championship series. This format was slightly modified due to the entry of the Tanduay Rhum Masters in 1999. The top eight teams after a round-robin eliminations will advance to the quarterfinals. The top two seeds will have a twice-to-beat advantage against the last two seeded teams. Other seeded teams will compete in a best-of-three playoffs. The winners will compete in a best-of-five semifinals series. Then the winners of the semifinals will advance to a best-of-seven finals series.
After the reintroduction of the tournament in 2011, the league adopted a tournament format similar on what was used in 1998. The top two teams will gain automatic semifinals seed while the next four teams will compete in a best-of-three quarterfinals.
From the 2013 edition of the tournament, the playoff format was revised and adopted the similar playoff format used for the Philippine Cup, in which the first two teams will gain a twice to beat advantage against the last two seeded teams and the other teams will compete for a best of three playoffs.
The height limit for import players varies from every year. In the tournament's reintroduction in 2011, the height limit was 6'4". In 2012, the league removed the height restrictions. The handicapping system was reimposed in 2014, where the height limit will be 6'11" for the non-playoff teams, and 6'9" for the playoff teams of the previous Philippine Cup.
Trophy design.
The trophy design used since the 1994 season features the Commissioner's Cup with the league logo at the front. The cup is placed in a base where the name of and the year of the tournament is engraved. Red, blue and yellow ribbons were placed in the handles of the trophy, mirroring the colors in the PBA logo. The winner keeps permanent possession of the trophy and a new one is created every year. In 2012, the trophy's cup handles were modified and the league logo was replaced with the tournament's season logo.

PBA Philippine Cup

The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) Philippine Cup is a tournament that does not allow teams to hire foreign players or imports. Prior to 2004-05 season, the tournament was then known as the PBA All-Filipino Cup. The Philippine Cup is considered the most prestigious tournament in a PBA season.
The current defending champions of the Philippine Cup are the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers.
Since the 2006–07 season, the Jun Bernardino Trophy were awarded to the champions. The trophy is worth PHP ₱500,000 and made up of 24-karat gold plate, in which the champions can keep for a year. After that, they will receive a smaller replica of the trophy. If a team wins three consecutive tournaments, the franchise gets to keep the trophy and not the replica. The trophy is named after former PBA commissioner Jun Bernardino.
In the history of the league, only the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters were able to win the All-Filipino conference three consecutive times in a yearly succession (2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13). By achieving this distinction, the Tropang Texters also became the first team to be given permanent possession of the Bernardino Trophy. The second version of the Jun Bernardino Trophy is currently with the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers.
The 1975 and 1976 editions of the tournament were reclassified as an import-laden conference since the league gave the teams the option of hiring imports. The first tournament that prohibited teams of having foreign players (imports) was held in 1977.
The 1981 and 1982 seasons did not have an All-Filipino Conference.

PBA Governors' Cup

The PBA Governors' Cup is a tournament of a Philippine Basketball Association season. The tournament require teams to hire a single import. The event was usually held as league's third conference from 1993 to 2001. In 2003, the tournament was scrapped and was replaced by a Reinforced Conference, an import-laced conference. The tournament was revived in 2011 after the league re-adopted the three conference format.
The "Governors' Cup" also refers to the trophy awarded to the champion team.
History.
During the 1993 PBA season, the league renamed the Third Conference as the Governors' Cup, a reference the members of the PBA Board of Governors. The singular name "Governor" refers to the board representative of each team. The conference usually was the last tournament held in a PBA season.
After San Miguel won the first Governors Cup in 1993, Alaska dominated the tournament from 1994-1997. In 1998, due to the league's commitment with the Philippine Centennial Team, they allowed each team to take two imports with a combined height of 12 feet. Shell, with no players taken for the national team, won the tournament over Mobiline.
San Miguel Beer won the tournament from 1999-2000 before Sta. Lucia upset the Beermen a year later, giving the Realtors its first PBA title. In 2002, due to the league's commitment to the national team, the Governors Cup became the first conference, while moving the All-Filipino Conference as its third and last tournament. Since most of the team's star players are with the national squad, the PBA once again allowed team's to take two imports with a 12-feet maximum height limit. Purefoods beat Alaska in seven games to win the title.
The tournament was retired in 2003 after the re-introduction of the Reinforced Conference as the third conference of the season but was eventually reactivated in 2011 after the league restored the three-conference season format.
Tournament format.
From 1993 to 1995, the teams were divided to two groups in the elimination round. The teams in the same group will play against each other once and against teams in the other group twice. After the eliminations, the top five teams will advance to a double-round robin semifinals. A playoff incentive will be given to a team that will win five of their eight semifinal games should they fail to get the top two finals berths. The top two teams (or the #1 team and the winner of the playoff between team with at least 5 semifinal wins and the #2 team) will face each other in a best-of-seven championship series.
In 1996, the league adopted a quarterfinal-semifinal playoff format with the top two seeds advancing automatically to the semifinals and the next four teams will be matched up in the quarterfinals after the eliminations.
A different tournament format was used in 1998 when it carried over the elimination standings of the preceding Centennial Cup. The teams were pitted again in a single round robin eliminations with the top four teams advancing to the semifinals. The remaining teams will compete in a single round robin semifinals, with the top two teams advancing in the finals.
In 1999, a new quarterfinal-semifinal playoff format was introduced due to the entry of the Tanduay Rhum Masters. The top eight teams after a round-robin eliminations will advance to the quarterfinals. The top two seeds will have a twice-to-beat advantage against the last two seeded teams. Other seeded teams will compete in a best-of-three playoffs.
After the reintroduction of the tournament in 2011, the league adopted a tournament format similar on what was used in 1995. Dubbed as the "classic PBA format", the tournament begins in a single round robin eliminations. The top six teams will advance in a single round robin semifinals. A playoff incentive will be given to a team that will win four of their five semifinal games should they fail to get the top two finals berths. The top two teams (or the #1 team and the winner of the playoff between team with at least 5 semifinal wins and the #2 team) will face each other in a best-of-seven championship series.
The tournament format since the 2013 edition was changed to a quarterfinal-semifinal playoff format. The top eight teams after a single round-robin elimination round will advance to the quarterfinals. The top four teams will have a twice-to-beat incentive against their opponents during this round. The winners will advance to a best of five semifinal round and the winners of this round will meet in a best-of-seven championship series.
Import rules.
The height limit for import players varies from every year. In 2011, the height adopted a handicapping system in which the top two teams of the combined results of the Philippine and Commissioner's Cups are allowed to have an import with a 6'2" height limit. The next four teams will be allowed with a 6'4" import and the last two teams will be allowed with a 6'6" import. In 2012, the handicapping was scrapped and the league set the height limit of imports to 6'5".
While the tournament is underway, a team can play with an All-Filipino lineup only once. Imports can be replaced in the whole duration of the tournament (including finals).
Trophy design.
The trophy design used since the 1994 season features the Governors' Cup with the league logo at the front. The cup is placed in a base where the all of the logos of the participating teams of the tournament are engraved. A unique feature of this trophy is that the champion team's logo is placed at the front middle of the trophy with the runner up at its left and the 3rd place at the right. The rest of the team logos are arranged according to their rankings at the conclusion of the tournament. 
Red, blue and yellow ribbons were placed in the handles of the trophy, mirroring the colors in the PBA logo. The winner keeps permanent possession of the trophy and a new one is created every year. In 2012, the trophy's cup handles were modified and the league logo was replaced with the tournament's season logo.

Butler v. Moore

Butler v. Moore reported in MacNally's "Rules of Evidence", , 253, was an Irish case decided by Master of the Rolls in Ireland Sir Michael Smith. It is an important precedent in the issue of priest-penitent privilege in the UK. The case concerned the will of John Butler, 12th Baron Dunboyne, who had converted from Catholicism to Protestantism. He was alleged, however, to have returned to Catholicism and, thereby, to have come within a penal law which deprived "lapsed papists" of the power to make a will.
Facts.
Butler was Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork at the time of the death of the previous peer. Anxious to be able to transmit in a direct line the peerage and the headship of an ancient house, the new Lord Dunboyne appealed to the Pope for a dispensation from his vow of celibacy. It was refused him, and, thereupon, he became a Protestant and married, but had no issue. It is said that one day while he was driving along a country road a woman rushed out of a cottage, calling for a priest for someone who lay dangerously ill inside. Lord Dunboyne answered her "I am a priest", and, entering the cottage, he heard the dying person's confession. From a certain moment, said to have been this, till the end of his life he conformed again, at least, privately, to the Catholic faith.
Disputed will.
His will was disputed by his sister, Mrs. Catherine O'Brien Butler, on the ground that, having reconformed to Catholicism, he was incapable of making one. In order to prove that fact she administered interrogatories to Father Gahan, a priest who had attended Lord Dunboyne shortly before his death, to the following effect: What religion did Lord Dunboyne profess, first, from 1783 to 1792? and, second, at the time of his death, and a short time before? As to the first question, Fr. Gahan answered that Lord Dunboyne professed the Protestant religion. To the second question he demurred on the ground that his knowledge (if any) arose from a confidential communication made to him in the exercise of his clerical functions, which the principles of his religion forbade him to disclose, nor was he bound by the law of the land to answer. The Master of the Rolls held, after argument by counsel, that there was no privilege, and he overruled the demurrer. Fr. Gahan adhered to his refusal to answer and he was adjudged guilty of contempt of court and was imprisoned.
Precedent.
This authority was decisively rejected by the President of the High Court of Ireland in 1945 in "Cook v Carroll", where he found that a priest has absolute privilege not to reveal what is said in the confessional.

Publication.
"Haru wo Daiteita" was published in Japan by Biblos until its bankruptcy in 2006, when the series was picked up by Libre Publishing. "Haru wo Daiteita" was published in English by Central Park Media under its label Be Beautiful, in an agreement with Biblos, as "Embracing Love". In 2007 following Biblos' bankruptcy, Libre published an open letter on their website which said that English-language publishers had to renegotiate publishing rights for Biblos' former series with Libre, specifically naming CPM's releases as "illegal".
In July 2008, Youka Nitta traced a magazine ad and used the drawing as the cover for chapter 49 of "Haru wo Daiteita", as a result the series was pulled from the next issue of BeXBoy Gold, Nitta declined to attend Yaoi-Con, and Libre removed mentions of her and her work from their website, Nitta saying that she will quit manga work. The ad company who created the ad that was traced released a statement saying that they consider Nitta's tracing of their ad to be "a tribute".
In June 2009, Libre announced that Nitta had finished drawing "Haru wo Daiteita" and that the fourteenth and final volume would be released in autumn. It was released in November 2009, selling 24,078 copies in the first week. The final volume is available on Amazon Kindle.
OVA.
The OVA Haru Wo Daite, otherwise known as 'Embracing Love', has two episodes (30 minutes long).
Reception.
The refreshing "reversible" nature of the couple has been praised, and it is thought that this is the first series to be published in English which has a reversible couple. The conceit of both characters being pornographic actors has been described as being unusual in yaoi. The interspersion of humour and everyday life in the series has been praised, as has the "honesty of the emotions" in the work. Iwaki's continuing refusal to have sex with men has been seen as odd, given his profession. By volume 3, the art style has "softened", described as being reflective of the softening of the characters. Julie Rosato has criticised the production values of CPM's release of volume 4. The series has been called "gloriously porntastic".
An artbook was published by CPM in English, the production values were praised, and the English edition was described as an "absolutely worthy substitute" for the original Japanese artbook.
The structuring of the OVA episodes has been criticised, as "it's not exactly clear what time period we're watching." The OVA episodes have been said to be "quite tame", as no genitalia are visible.

Personality type

Personality type refers to the psychological classification of different types of individuals. Personality types are sometimes distinguished from personality traits, with the latter embodying a smaller grouping of behavioral tendencies. Types are sometimes said to involve "qualitative" differences between people, whereas traits might be construed as "quantitative" differences. According to type theories, for example, introverts and extraverts are two fundamentally different categories of people. According to trait theories, introversion and extraversion are part of a continuous dimension, with many people in the middle.
Clinically effective personality typologies.
Effective personality typologies reveal and increase knowledge and understanding of individuals, as opposed to diminishing knowledge and understanding as occurs in the case of stereotyping. Effective typologies also allow for increased ability to predict clinically relevant information about people and to develop effective treatment strategies.
There is an extensive literature on the topic of classifying the various types of human temperament and an equally extensive literature on personality traits or domains. These classification systems attempt to describe normal temperament and personality and emphasize the predominant features of different temperament and personality types; they are largely the province of the discipline of psychology. Personality disorders, on the other hand, reflect the work of psychiatry, a medical specialty, and are disease-oriented. They are classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) a product of the American Psychiatric Association.
Types vs. traits.
The term "type" has not been used consistently in psychology and has become the source of some confusion. Furthermore, because personality test scores usually fall on a bell curve rather than in distinct categories, personality type theories have received considerable criticism among psychometric researchers. One study that directly compared a “type” instrument (the MBTI) to a “trait” instrument (the NEO PI) found that the trait measure was a better predictor of personality disorders. Because of these problems, personality type theories have fallen out of favor in psychology. Most researchers now believe that it is impossible to explain the diversity of human personality with a small number of discrete types. They recommend trait models instead, such as the five factor model.
Carl Jung.
One of the more influential ideas originated in the theoretical work of Carl Jung as published in the book "Psychological Types". The original German language edition, "Psychologische Typen", was first published by Rascher Verlag, Zurich in 1921. Typologies such as Socionics, the MBTI assessment, and the Keirsey Temperament Sorter have roots in Jungian philosophy.
Jung's interest in typology grew from his desire to reconcile the theories of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, and to define how his own perspective differed from theirs. Jung wrote, “In attempting to answer this question, I came across the problem of types; for it is one's psychological type which from the outset determines and limits a person's judgment.” (Jung, 1989:207) He concluded that Freud's theory was extraverted and Adler's introverted. (Jung, [1921 1971: par. 91) Jung became convinced that acrimony between the Adlerian and Freudian camps was due to this unrecognized existence of different fundamental psychological attitudes, which led Jung “to conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism.” (Jung, 1966: par. 64)
Four functions of consciousness.
In the book Jung categorized people into primary types of .
Jung proposed the existence of two dichotomous pairs of cognitive functions:
Jung went on to suggest that these functions are expressed in either an introverted or extraverted form.
Jung proposed four main functions of consciousness:
According to Jung, the psyche is an apparatus for adaptation and orientation, and consists of a number of different psychic functions. Among these he distinguishes four basic functions:
Thinking and feeling functions are rational, while sensation and intuition are nonrational. According to Jung, rationality consists of figurative thoughts, feelings or actions with reason — a point of view based on objective value, which is set by practical experience. Nonrationality is not based in reason. Jung notes that elementary facts are also nonrational, not because they are illogical but because, as thoughts, they are not judgments.
Attitudes: Extraversion and Introversion.
Analytical psychology distinguishes several psychological types or temperaments.
Extraversion means “outward-turning” and introversion means “inward-turning.” These specific definitions vary somewhat from the popular usage of the words.
The preferences for extraversion and introversion are often called as "attitudes". Each of the cognitive functions can operate in the external world of behavior, action, people, and things ("extraverted attitude") or the internal world of ideas and reflection ("introverted attitude").
People who prefer extraversion draw energy from action: they tend to act, then reflect, then act further. If they are inactive, their motivation tends to decline. To rebuild their energy, extraverts need breaks from time spent in reflection. Conversely, those who prefer introversion "expend" energy through action: they prefer to reflect, then act, then reflect again. To rebuild their energy, introverts need quiet time alone, away from activity.
The extravert's flow is directed outward toward people and objects, and the introvert's is directed inward toward concepts and ideas. Contrasting characteristics between extraverts and introverts include the following:
The attitude type could be thought of as the flow of libido (psychic energy). The functions are modified by two main attitude types: extraversion and introversion. In any person, the degree of introversion or extraversion of one function can be quite different from that of another function.
Four functions: sensation, intuition, thinking, feeling.
Jung identified two pairs of psychological functions:
"Sensation" and "intuition" are the information-gathering (perceiving) functions. They describe how new information is understood and interpreted. Individuals who prefer the sensation function are more likely to trust information that is in the present, tangible and concrete: that is, information that can be understood by the five senses. They tend to distrust hunches, which seem to come “out of nowhere.” They prefer to look for details and facts. For them, the meaning is in the data. On the other hand, those who prefer the intuition function tend to trust information that is more abstract or theoretical, that can be associated with other information (either remembered or discovered by seeking a wider context or pattern). They may be more interested in future possibilities. They tend to trust those flashes of insight that seem to bubble up from the unconscious mind. The meaning is in how the data relates to the pattern or theory.
"Thinking" and "feeling" are the decision-making (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both used to make rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer the thinking function tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer the feeling function tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it “from the inside” and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering the needs of the people involved.
As noted already, people who prefer the thinking function do not necessarily, in the everyday sense, “think better” than their feeling counterparts; the opposite preference is considered an equally rational way of coming to decisions (and, in any case, the MBTI assessment is a measure of preference, not ability). Similarly, those who prefer the feeling function do not necessarily have “better” emotional reactions than their thinking counterparts.
Dominant function.
All four functions are used at different times depending on the circumstances. However, one of the four functions is generally used more dominantly and proficiently than the other three, in a more conscious and confident way. According to Jung the dominant function is supported by two auxiliary functions. (In MBTI publications the first auxiliary is usually called the auxiliary or secondary function and the second auxiliary function is usually called the tertiary function.) The fourth and least conscious function is always the opposite of the dominant function. Jung called this the "inferior function" and Myers sometimes also called it the "shadow".
Jung's typological model regards psychological type as similar to left or right handedness: individuals are either born with, or develop, certain preferred ways of thinking and acting. These psychological differences are sorted into four opposite pairs, or "dichotomies", with a resulting eight possible psychological types. People tend to find using their opposite psychological preferences more difficult, even if they can become more proficient (and therefore behaviorally flexible) with practice and development.
The four functions operate in conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and introversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted way. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example, uses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is introverted intuition.
The eight psychological types are as follows:
Jung theorized that the dominant function characterizes consciousness, while its opposite is repressed and characterizes unconscious behavior. Generally, we tend to favor our most developed "dominant" function, while we can broaden our personality by developing the others. Related to this, Jung noted that the unconscious often tends to reveal itself most easily through a person's least developed "inferior" function. The encounter with the unconscious and development of the underdeveloped functions thus tend to progress together.
When the unconscious inferior functions fail to develop, imbalance results. In "Psychological Types", Jung describes in detail the effects of tensions between the complexes associated with the dominant and inferior differentiating functions in highly one-sided individuals.
Personality types and worrying.
The relationship between worry - the tendency of one's thoughts and mental images to revolve around and create negative emotions, and the experience of a frequent level of fear - and Jung's model of psychological types has been the subject of recent studies. In particular, correlational analysis has shown that the tendency to worry is significantly related to Jung's Introversion and Feeling dimensions. Similarly, worry has shown robust correlations with shyness and fear of social situations. The worrier's tendency to be fearful of social situations might make them appear more withdrawn.
Jung's model suggests that the superordinate dimension of personality is introversion and extraversion. Introverts are likely to relate to the external world by listening, reflecting, being reserved, and having focused interests. Extraverts on the other hand, are adaptable and in tune with the external world. They prefer interacting with the outer world by talking, actively participating, being sociable, expressive, and having a variety of interests. Jung (1921) also identified two other dimensions of personality: Intuition - Sensing and Thinking - Feeling. Sensing types tend to focus on the reality of present situations, pay close attention to detail, and are concerned with practicalities. Intuitive types focus on envisioning a wide range of possibilities to a situation and favor ideas, concepts, and theories over data. Individuals who score higher on intuition also score higher on general. Thinking types use objective and logical reasoning in making their decisions, are more likely to analyze stimuli in a logical and detached manner, be more emotionally stable, and score higher on intelligence. Feeling types make judgments based on subjective and personal values. In interpersonal decision-making, feeling types tend to emphasize compromise to ensure a beneficial solution for everyone. They also tend to be somewhat more neurotic than thinking types. The worrier's tendency to experience a fearful affect, could be manifested in Jung's feeling type.

Gameplay.
Combat.
The fighting system works around four main attack button configuration, that consists of punch, kick, slash, and heavy slash. Additional buttons allow the player to perform taunts, and throw enemies in the air. When the character cause damage or move toward its adversary, a tension gauge charges. On other hand, when the character move backwards or use defensive moves often, the tension gauge is reduced. Once the gauge is filled, by pressing four buttons at the same time, the character enters in Super Mode. When the characters are in this state, the player can perform the character's super move or to use a variety of special techniques. 
In the HUD there is also a burst gauge, which is fulfilled as the player cause or receive damage. By pressing buttons in combination, the player character jump and unleash a blast of energy. It allows the player to break combinations and super moves in the middle of the opponent's offensive. Also, if the blast hit the adversary, the tension gauge is filled to its maximum capacity immediately.
Modes.
"Guilty Gear X2" offers eight modes: Arcade, Survival, M.O.M. (an acronym for Medal of Millionaires), Mission, Story, Trainning, Versus 2P and Versus CPU. The Arcade Mode allows the player to fight against several enemies until reach the final fight against the boss. On the Survival Mode, the player continuously battle against enemies until reach the 500th and final level or die, whichever comes first. Medal of Millionaires is a variation in which the player earn medals by performing combos. In the Mission Mode, there are 50 challenges, in which the player fight with and against a predetermined character; the player character have handicaps such as being prevented from jumping, poisoned or start a fight with half of health. The Story Mode, reveals the game's plot through battles interleaved with conversations between the player character and its enemies. It vary depending on the player's choice and performance in the battles; there is a total of 60 possible endings. The Training Mode allows the player to learn attacks by fighting a customizable CPU enemy. Two players can play in the Versus 2P, and on the Versus CPU the player fight against a AI-controlled character. In addition to those modes, there is a gallery with artworks, character endings, and cut scenes that are unlocked by playing Arcade, Mission and Story Mode.
Synopsis.
Plot.
"Guilty Gear X2" continues the overall plot of the series, which takes place in a fictional 22nd century in which its present time has just recovered from a 100-year-war against man-made bio-organic weapons called "Gears". A few years later, however, there is rumors about a new type of Gear that the government started to chase. It is discovered that this Gear is Dizzy, a girl who does not wish harm anyone. As she joins the Jellyfish Air Pirates, the authorities find that the threat has disappeared, stopping to chase her.
It picks up the story approximately two weeks after the events of its predecessor, "Guilty Gear X". A new organization called Post-War Administration Bureau is looking for and destroying Gears, descendants of Japanese, and those who are able to use "qi" energy in combat. To achieve their goals the organization has created several copies of Ky Kiske, the Robo-Kys. In addition, I-No sparks conflict as she wants to destroy all she perceived threats to her master, "That Man", the creator of the Gears. Each character provide a different ending to "Guilty Gear X2".

Testament and Dizzy make their first appearances as non-boss characters.
Development and release.
In January 2002, Sammy Studios had announced that a "Guilty Gear X" spin-off, titled "Guilty Gear XX", would be released in Japanese arcades on the Sega NAOMI system in the spring of that year; it was released on May 23, 2002. Its portion to the PlayStation 2 was speculated in late August, with release date set to autumn in Japan, which was later confirmed by Sammy in the same month. In the following month it was shown at Tokyo Game Show, and it was published on December 12, 2002 in Japan. In October, the game North American release under the title "Guilty Gear X2" was set to happen in the first quarter of 2003. An announcement in November confirmed its release date as February 4, 2003; in January 2003, Sammy created a website to promote its release. On February 26, 2004, it was rereleased in Japan under the label "PlayStation2 the Best".
Reception.
"Guilty Gear X2" was the 117th best-selling title in Japan in 2002, with 112,520 copies sold as of December 31, 2002. In 2003, it accumulated 34,294 more sold copies, amounting 146,814 copies sold since its release on PlayStation 2 (PS2). Reviews for it were generally positive, with aggregate scores of 86.14% from GameRankings, and 87/100 from Metacritic. On release, "Famitsu" magazine scored the PS2 version of the game a 33 out of 40. The game received the maximum score from "Cincinnati Enquirer", G4 TV, and "Gaming Age".
Jeremy Dunham of IGN, GameZone's Michael Knutson and 1UP.com staff praised the multitude of moves; Knutson, however, said there is a difficult into performing special moves, and 1UP.com affirmed "The real improvement, though, is the addition of more life-destroying options, like the hyper-addictive Challenge mode." Dunham pointed the fighting engine is "too advanced for the casual fighting fan", also criticizing its "sucker" control scheme. Conversely, "GamePro" thought it "can be enjoyed by novices and veterans alike", and Matt Keil of G4 said it "is surprisingly accessible" to all gamers. Dunham cited how the "two-player mode allows for near-infinite possibilities and all the extra options are just icing on the cake." In contrast Kasavin criticized the other modes for not being so "engaging" as the two-player mode.
Dunham stated it has "Incredibly attractive backgrounds, super slick animations, and the best character design on PlayStation 2." A "Electronic Gaming Monthly" ("EGM") reviewer stated it has "cooler character designs on a PS2 fighter" while other one, "some of the coolest 2D game artwork ever." "Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine" deemed it as "he best-looking 2D graphics ever seen in a fighter." 1UP.com said, "the ultrasharp, hi-res character art and fluid animation keep "XX" at the cutting 2D edge." Dunham, Knutson, Keil, and "GamePro" commended its similarity with Japanese animated series. The reviewer for "GamePro" opined it "becomes an art form in its own right." Greg Kasavin of GameSpot, however, said "many of the moves in the game are animated so strangely that it can be difficult to see exactly what's going on."
Kasavin commented its "cohesive musical style" "further helps set this game apart." Dunham deemed it as having "One of the best soundtracks to come along for quite some time", and praised Sammy for keeping the original voice actors were kept, as well as did Knutson, which felt this fact "gives it a 'cooler aura.'" Keil and Knutson found the sound effects to be "excellent" and "really great" respectively. On other hand, "GamePro" described the sound design as the game's "major flaw." "EGM" remarked "Depending on your tastes, "GGX2"s pervasive heavy-metal cheesiness might negatively influence your opinion of the game."
Other features praised include its shortly loading time, the variety of game modes and characters, the balance between characters' habilities, its controls' responsiveness, its replay value, and variety of features. Dunham even declared it "reads like the bible of fighting game options. Taking a page from every other title out there, there doesn't seem to be a single feature on the horizon that's been left out of "GGX2" for fear of the Completists." In spite of the praise, other criticism vary from its general difficult to the lack of a online play mode, position of move list in training mode, and the difficult to perform moves in Dual Shock.
D. F. Smith from IGN elected it the best game of 2002. It ranked fifth in the "GameSpy's 2003 PlayStation 2 Games of the Year" with the staff saying ""Guilty Gear X2" is easily one of the best fighting games to come out in the last couple years". IGN's editors selected it as the ninth best "Hidden Gems"—fun video games with poor sales in America. In 2007, UGO Networks placed it ninth in their "Top 11 Fighting Games", with its staff qualifing it as the best game of the series. IGN cited "X2" had all of the qualities previous games, but "in bigger quantities than we had ever seen", including it in the 28th place of its 2010 "Top 100 PlayStation 2 Games" list. In the same year, UGO also placed it 12th among the "Top 25 Fighting Games of All Time". Likewise, About.com placed it eighth on their "Top 10 PlayStation 2 Fighting Games of All Time", while "Complex" ranked it tenth among "The 50 Best Fighting Games of All Time", and included it in the fifth place in "The 25 Best 2D Fighting Games of All Time".

French legislative election, 1962

French legislative elections took place on 18 November and 25 November 1962 to elect the 2nd National Assembly of the Fifth Republic.
Since 1959 and the change of Algerian policy (Charles de Gaulle decided in favour of the "self-government" and "Algerian Algeria"), France had faced bomb attacks by the Secret Armed Organization ("Organisation armée secrète" or OAS) which opposed the independence of Algeria, negotiated by the FLN with the March 1962 Evian agreements and approved by referendum by the French people. This policy was disapproved by some members of the "Presidential Majority".
Simultaneously, when Georges Pompidou replaced Michel Debré as Prime minister, the center-right parties (MRP and CNIP) left the majority due to de Gaulle's eurosceptic declaration. Like the Left, they denounced the presidentialization of the regime.
On 22 August de Gaulle escaped from an assassination attempt by the OAS in Le Petit-Clamart. He subsequently announced a controversial referendum in which he proposed the election of the president of the French Republic under universal suffrage. The presidential majority composed of the UNR and the Independent Republicans (RI) (which came from a CNIP split) campaigned for a "yes", while all the other parties formed a "coalition of no" and brought down Pompidou's cabinet by a vote of no confidence ("motion de censure").
However, de Gaulle finally won the referendum and dissolved the National Assembly. During the legislative campaign, all the parties, except the UNR and the RI, criticized the "personal power" which they believed distorted France's Republican institutions. Indeed, in the French political culture and in their mind, Republicanism was inseparable from parliamentary democracy and the reinforcement of the presidential powers was associated with Bonapartism. Contrary to the previous legislative election, the left-wing parties finalized an electoral agreement. The subsequent legislative elections saw advances for the left-wing opposition. However, conservative voters sanctioned the center-right parties, preferring to vote for the Gaullist party. Pompidou became Prime Minister again.

Low Budget (album)

Low Budget is the seventeenth studio album by the English rock group, The Kinks, released in 1979. It was a great success for the group, becoming their best-selling non-compilation album, peaking at #11 on the US album charts.
"Low Budget" represented a major renaissance for the Kinks, especially in the United States. After a decade of concept albums and songs that recalled simpler times, "Low Budget" marked a new direction for the Kinks by addressing contemporary issues such as inflation, labour strife (which was especially severe in the U.K. during the 1978-79 Winter of Discontent), and the 1979 energy crisis. Songs such as "Catch Me Now I'm Falling", which was Davies' take on America's declining influence in the world, "(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman", "Low Budget", and "A Gallon of Gas", epitomized these themes. In another change for the band, the Kinks recorded "Low Budget" in the U.S. and launched an extensive concert tour in America to support the album. Six of the eleven songs from the album are included on the double-live album "One for the Road" which was recorded in 1979 and 1980 during the "Low Budget" tour.
Singles.
Five songs were released from "Low Budget" as singles (one in both the U.S. and U.K., two in the U.S., and two in the U.K.) with varying degrees of success.
"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman".
"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman", influenced by Davies's viewing of a "Superman" movie, was the only track on "Low Budget" to be made a single (with "Low Budget" as B-side) in both Britain and America. It was also the only single to chart.
"A Gallon of Gas".
"A Gallon of Gas", a track based on the difficulty to buy gas at the time, was a U.S. only single, backed with "Low Budget". It did not chart.
"Catch Me Now I'm Falling".
"Catch Me Now I'm Falling", backed with "Low Budget", was the second U.S. only single, as well as the second not to chart. The song shows Ray Davies portraying Captain America as symbolism of the United States, and criticizes both the U.S. and the countries that did not come to its aid.
"Moving Pictures".
"Moving Pictures", the second U.K. single, laments on how life is "always moving.". "Moving Pictures" was released as a single in the U.K. backed with "In a Space". It did not make a dent in the charts.
"Pressure".
"Pressure" was the third and final U.K. single from "Low Budget", with "National Health" as the B-side. AllMusic claimed that it "wants to be an anthem but never really develops any sort of compelling continuity." It was released in live format on "One for the Road".
