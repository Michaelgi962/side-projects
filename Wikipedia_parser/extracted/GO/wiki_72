Weimarer Passion

The work commonly referred to as the Weimarer Passion, BWV deest (BC D 1), is a musical composition among the "Passions" written by Johann Sebastian Bach, composed in 1717 for at least two solo voices, choir and orchestra with text by an unknown librettist. Both the text and music are lost, but many movements from this work have been reused in other forms and at other times. At one time, it was thought that the work set chapters and of the Gospel of Matthew to music, with interspersed chorales and arias, but current consensus is that it is possible that the text reflected a synopsis of two or more Gospel texts, as well as the interspersed chorales and arias.
Background.
There has been much written about this work since Bach's death. Of the five Passion settings mentioned in his Obituary written by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Sebastian's former pupil Johann Friedrich Agricola, two have come down to us with any degree of certainty (the St John Passion BWV 245 (BC D 2a-e) and the St Matthew Passion BWV 244 (BC D 3a-b)). A third has come down to us in the form of a libretto dating 1731 (published 1732) and a newly discovered libretto dating from 1744 (found in the National Library in St. Petersburg No. 17,139.1.423). A fourth has come down to us in the form of a manuscript copy by Bach and his son Carl Philipp Emanuel dating from c. 1730 (with an addition recently discovered in Bach's hand dating from c. 1745/1746) of an anonymous (the original has been lost) "St Luke Passion" that originally was attributed to Bach (BWV 246 D 6), but has now been attributed to a yet unknown master that was active in Thuringia in the early 18th century (possibly ending in ca. 1717) (the attribution to Johann Melchior Molter has been rejected based on the fact that some of the material in the manuscript was done in Carl Philipp Emanuel's hand, and that he (Emanuel) left Leipzig in 1734 for Frankfurt an der Oder). Much speculation has been made over the identity of the fifth Passion setting. Theories have ranged from a one-choir setting of the "St Matthew Passion" ("Eine Paßion nach dem Matthäus, incomplet" was listed in the "Verzeichniß des musikalischen Nachlasses des verstorbenen Capellmeisters Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach" (1714–1788) published by Gortlieb Friedrich Schniebes in Hamburg in 1790). Others have speculated that the subject of this article (the "Weimarer Passion") would be the fifth Passion setting discussed in the Obituary. Others have speculated that this Passion setting is in reality not an Oratorio Passion at all, but rather a Passion Oratorio setting of a text by Christian Friedrich Henrici entitled "Erbauliche Gedanken auf den Gruenen Donnerstag und Charfreitag ueber den Leidenden Jesum" (a part of his 1725 text cycle Sammlung erbaulicher Gedancken über und auf die gewöhnlichen Sonn- und Festtage).
Bach in 1717.
The year 1717 proved to be a pivotal one in the life and career of the then Court Organist and Concertmaster to the main Court of William Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Johann Sebastian Bach. That year, he gained some notoriety outside of the immediate circles where he lived and worked (namely the areas that comprise the modern state of Thuringia) when the diplomat, musician, music theoretician, and Cantor of the old St. Mary's Cathedral, Hamburg, (which was dismantled in 1805), Johann Mattheson, published his Das Beschützte Orchestre, oder desselben Zweyte Eröffnung: Worinn Nicht nur einem würcklichen galant-homme ... sondern auch manchem Musico selbst die alleraufrichtigste und deutlichste Vorstellung musicalischer Wissenschaften ... In Part I, Chapter V, p. 222 of this treatise, Mattheson states "Ich habe von dem berühmten Organisten zu Weimar/hrn. Joh. Sebastian Bach/Sachen gesehen..." ("I have of the organist to Weimar/Mr. Joh. Sebastian Bach/seen things ..."). In the same work, he also catalogues all the famous organists of the current and former ages. Thus, for the first time, the name of Johann Sebastian Bach appeared in print. In autumn of that year, Bach was invited to a Keyboard instrument contest to take place in the capital city of the Electorate of Saxony, Dresden, between himself and the French Royal Court Organist and Keyboardist Louis Marchand, who was then towards the end of a long concert tour of the Holy Roman Empire. When Bach arrived, however, he learned that his rival had left the night before, thus aborting the contest and by default acknowledging his inferiority to Bach's skills.
Back at Weimar, his employment situation became more complicated. In 1716, his co-employer Ernest Augustus I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach had married Princess Eleonore Wilhelmine of Anhalt-Köthen (an event that Bach probably participated in and for which he provided music). The new duchess's brother (Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen) may also have attended the event. If that is the case, he would have met Bach then. At any rate, on 5 August 1717, Leopold officially ordered Bach to become his Court "Kapellmeister." Around the same time (1717), the relations between the co-rulers in Weimar became even more strained than they had been previously, to the point that Wilhelm Ernst officially forbade his employees to have any relations or communications with the "Rotes Schloss" (Ernst August's residence). Wilhelm Ernst was also looking for a successor to the post of "Kapellmeister" at his court (the previous occupant of the post, Johann Samuel Drese, had died on 1 December 1716). Eventually Drese's son (a less talented candidate) was selected for the post. Possibly because of this perceived snub, and also because of the perceived better circumstances awaiting him in Köthen (both financially and prestige), after the aborted keyboard contest, Bach began more vehemently to request his release from Wilhelm Ernst. He had become so insistent that between 6 November and 2 December, Bach was imprisoned before final permission was granted. The court secretary's report of the incident relates as follows:
At any rate, during this flurry of activity, Bach had also received a commission from Frederick II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg to compose and perform a Passion setting for his court for Good Friday (his then "Kapellmeister," Christian Friedrich Witt, was on his deathbed). Bach accepted the commission, and performed the work on 26 March 1717 at the Schloss Friedenstein Chapel. The work performed there was the so-called "Weimarer Passion".
The work.
As mentioned above, the text and music of this so-called "Weimarer Passion" BWV deest (BC D 1) no longer survives. However, over the years much has been written and discussed about the work and its contents. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that nine movements from this work had been reused and have come down to us in different forms. These are as follows:
On 7 February 1723, the fifth movement mentioned above was used again after the sermon as the fourth and final movement of the second trial piece Bach wrote for his application for the post of Cantor of St. Thomas Church, Leipzig and "Directoris Chori musici" of Leipzig, the Cantata Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn, BWV 23. For this work (BC A 47b, in B minor and scored for Soli: S A T, Coro: S A T B, Oboe d'amore I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Basso continuo), Bach set the movement in F minor for Soprano, Alto, Tenore, Basso, Oboe d'Amore I&II, Violino I&II, Viola, Basso continuo, the instruments not being "colla voce" (with the choral voices). The work was revived again (with the same setting and key) on 20 February 1724 (Quinquagesima or Estomihi Sunday), this time with brass instruments (Cornetto, Trombone I-III, all "colla voce" Cornet with Soprano, Trombone I with Alto, Trombone II with Tenor, and Trombone III with Bass (voice type)).
In 1725, Bach revived (possibly a last-minute decision) his St John Passion BWV 245 (BC D 2b). It is possible that he had in mind a revival of this work (the Weimarer Passion), but realized that it was impossible (especially since the Leipzig liturgy required a Passion setting in two parts (each part framing the sermon). However, this did not stop Bach from reusing material from the Weimar work in this new Passion setting. Of the nine movements mentioned in the above list, Bach would use five of them in this Passion setting:
On 17 November 1726, Bach composed his Cantata for the 22nd Sunday after Trinity Sunday, "Ich armer Mensch, ich Sündenknecht, BWV 55." This work is scored for Solo: T, Coro: S A T B, Flauto traverso, Oboe d'amore, Violino I/II, Viola, Organo, Continuo and is in the key of G minor. For the final three movements of the work (an Aria-Recitative-Choral series), Bach employed movements 7-9 of the above-mentioned list of movements of the Weimarer Passion. The chorale setting BWV 283 would later find itself included in the collection of chorales that Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Johann Philipp Kirnberger compiled and Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf published between 1784 and 1787 (BWV 253-438).
In 1728/1731, Bach again revived his Quinquagesimae/Esto mihi Cantata Du wahrer Gott und Davids Sohn, BWV 23 (BC D 47c). This time he set it in C minor and scored it for Soli: S A T, Coro: S A T B, Oboe I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Organo, Continuo. In movement 4, therefore, Bach removed all the brass parts. He also revised the vocal parts of the same movement.
Finally, on 29 March 1736, 23 March 1742, and between 1743–1746, Bach revived his St Matthew Passion BWV 244 (BC D 3b) in a new form. In this version, he replaced the original four-part chorale setting that ends Part I with the chorale fantasia that he used in both the Weimarer Passion and as Movement 1 of the 1725 version of the St John Passion. This time, he scored it in E major for Coro I/II: S A T B, Flauto traverso I/II, Oboe d'amore I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Organo, Continuo. Due to repair issues in the 2nd organ, the 1742 version was revised in scoring for Coro: Soprano in ripieno, Organo (Treble clef), Cembalo (Harpsichord, Trebble clef)--1742 only, 1743-1746 Organo II (Trebble clef), Coro I/II: S A T B, Flauto traverso I/II, Oboe d'amore I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Viola da gamba, Organo, Cembalo, Continuo. Bach kept this scoring for his 1743-1746 revision (with the exception that he reverted to the 2nd organ in Coro II).
Vocal and Instrumental forces used.
The conjectured scoring for the work (based on the scoring of the aforementioned movements that had been reused in other forms) is: Solo: T solo, B solo; Coro: S A T B, Flauto traverso I/II, Oboe I/II, Violino I/II, Viola, Basso continuo. Much has been written about Bach's ensembles (both in size and constituents—both vocal and instrumental) that he used. Here are his own thoughts on the matter. In regards to vocal forces, he wrote:
which translates to:
He also lists in a note dating from about the same year (1730) the minimum requirements for the churches mentioned in the "Entwurff":
Likewise, he wrote of the instrumental forces required:
which translates to:
For a work such as this, however, the Timpani and the Trumpets would be excluded. Therefore, the ensemble required going by Leipzig standards—we have no information about ensemble requirements for Arnstadt-Köthen, the Vocal forces would require 12-16 singers (3-4 per part), with two per part for the solo roles, and the following:
Total of 20 players, to which would be added an Organist and Harpsichordist would probably be the harpsichordist, as according to the surviving information we have about his conducting position, he often conducted from the harpsichord.

History.
Projects.
Driven by his passion for songwriting Pedro's solo recording debut came in 2008 with the Portuguese single "A beira da estrada". This was the followed by his first Alternative Rock EP "The Light". Recorded in 2009, it has generated Pedro's biggest success to date. Discovered online by Polish radio producer and personality Piotr Baron the song went on to chart in Poland's singles chart. The Light reached a peek position of 11th on May 5, 2009 (see Charts). And was ranked 85th overall for 2009. According to Costa, "The Light" was also played nationally in Portugal by Rádio Renascença. Some success also came in Costa's native Canada. In 2010 "Fooled Again?" was discovered by CBC radio producer Amanda Putz and featured on CBC Radio 1 show "Bandwidth". The track also made the CBC radio 3 track of the day. ""A serious part-time activity for him... Well, that part-time activity is not doing too bad..."" - Amanda Putz
After several other singles releases and collaborative efforts his first full length album "Discovery" was released March 2011.
Film and Television.
Pedro's music has had placements on ABC, NBC, CBS, TLC, CTV, CNN, SyFy, National Geographic, Headline News, CNBC, Bravo, Esquire, Oxygen, TruTv, FoxSports2, Investigation Discovery, Fuse, History, Telemundo, Discovery channel, Travel Channel, MTV, WE, E!,AMC, Slice, Cloo, Spike TV, Nickelodeon, Nicktoons, WGN America, and FOX. His first TV licensing deal came from an original rendition of the song made famous by Johnny Cash, “God’s Gonna Cut You Down”
Emmy Award winning TV Producer Bill Pruitt had this to say:
"“The marriage of music and film has always been an extremely important part of my storytelling. In rendering the controversial world of medical marijuana as seen through the eyes of both growers and law enforcement, there was no better song to summon woe than “God’s Gonna Cut You Down.” Johnny Cash owned it top to bottom in how his version was reverent and mean. Nobody, we thought, could touch it. Nevertheless, we reached out to this kid somebody knew up in northern Ontario who offered to give it a go. By the time Pedro Costa’s opening guitar riff settled down, we knew we were in the hands of a master. It was astronaut music in bedlam. So tight, so mean, so angry and exhilarating. He set the tone. Then came his voice. Seasick and blasphemous, mournful and foreboding, he bit out the lyrics from faraway, his voice tweaked by some digital mastering, an artist’s touch. By the time it was over, he owned it every bit as much as the Man in Black. Pedro is a thief in the night, stealing songs you can’t imagine being done any other way and making them his own.”"

Chithramela

Chithramela is a 1967 Malayalam anthology film directed and produced by T .S. Muthiah. It was Malayalam cinema's first anthology film, consisting of three short films. The cast includes Prem Nazir, Sharada, Sheela, K. P. Ummer, Kottayam Chellappan, S. P. Pillai, Adoor Bhasi, Bahadoor and Manavalan Joseph.
Plots.
First segment ("Nagarathinte Mukhangal").
The short film showed the tragic fate of children left alone at home while the parents enjoyed themselves at late-night parties and meetings. One such couple, Sheela and Ummer, leave their daughter at home with the servant and go for a party . The naughty girl plays with the telephone, dials numbers and interacts with the person at the other end of the line. One such call results in trouble. The call was to a house which happened to be the venue of a murder. The girl says over the phone that she knew what was happening there. The murderer (Kottayam Chellappan) locates the number, kidnaps the girl and attempts to kill her. But the intervention of the police saves the girl's life.
Second segment ("Penninte Prapancham").
The characters in the film were the original film stars themselves. Adoor Bhasi, Manavalan Joseph and Bahadoor are trained to drive a car by S. P. Pillai, their "ashan" or teacher. They encounter hilarious situations with the women they meet. All the students and their teacher go into deep sleep. They wake up after 50 years to find that men have lost dominance; women, they find, have become all powerful in the world.
Third segment ("Apaswarangal").
The film told the story of a tragic love affair between a blind girl and a street singer. Seetha (Sharada), the daughter of a "coolie" in a colony is in love with Babu (Prem Nazir), a street singer. A city wastrel's evil eye falls on Seetha and Babu is beaten up severely by his goons. A famous dancer happens to listen to Babu's singing. Babu goes on to accept the patronage of the dancer, separating him from Seetha. The colony is hit by an outbreak of small pox. Except for Seetha and a small boy all the others die. Seetha and the boy leave in search of Babu. She hears Babu's voice from a theatre. Babu rushes to meet his lover. Seetha who is elated falls into his arms and dies.
Production.
Veteran actor T .S. Muthiah made his directorial debut with "Chithramela". He also produced the film under the banner of Sree Movies. Director M. Krishnan Nair is credited for giving technical assistance in direction. The idea for the short film "Penninte Prapancham" was by film producer T. E. Vasudevan. He, inturn, was inspired by a Laurel and Hardy film.
"Chithramela" was the first anthology film (portmanteau film) in Malayalam. Tamil film "Sirikkathe" (1939) was the first anthology film in India. Malayalam has produced only a handful of anthology films to date, which include "Yauvanam"/"Vandikkari" (1974), "Naalu Pennungal" (2007), "Kerala Cafe" (2009) and "Oru Yathrayil" (2013) among others. However, since the advent of new-wave Malayalam cinema of the 2010s, many films which used hyperlink format for storytelling came out. Some film pundits consider these films also as portmanteau films.
Music.
The film's music was provided by G. Devarajan. There are eight songs in the film, all of them included in the third and longest segment "Apaswarangal". Lyrics were penned by Sreekumaran Thampi who also penned the script for "Apaswarangal". All the songs became super hits. Seven solos by K. J. Yesudas, and a duet with S. Janaki, are considered gems in Malayalam film music.

Transmetal 2

Transmetal 2 (plural Transmetals 2), also known as Transmetal II, are a subgroup of the "Beast Wars" and "Beast Machines" characters in the fictional "Transformers" universe. They differ from standard Transmetal Transformers in that instead of having a mechanical beast mode and a techno-organic robot mode, they have an asymmetrical blending of mechanical and techno-organic parts in both modes. This has resulted in them looking monstrous in appearance.
Beast Wars.
According to the Transmetal 2 toy fiction, they were the result of cloning experiments carried out by Megatron. These experiments resulted in a breed of warriors that had enhanced strength and speed, however were hyper-aggressive and had increased savage impulses.
In the Beast Wars cartoon, a Vok (an alien-based alien creature) device known as the "Transmetal driver", somehow ended up in Megatron's possession. It was this device that was used to upgrade the Transmetal characters, Cheetor, Dinobot II and Blackarachnia into Transmetal 2. All three gained a degree of "supernatural" powers, for example Cheetor gained vague visionary tendencies, Dinobot II showed enhanced healing abilities, and Blackarachnia demonstrated telekinesis.
Beast Machines.
In the Beast Machines storyline, the Maximals had returned to their home planet of Cybertron where they encountered Megatron's virus. Whereas the virus instantly paralyzed the majority of Cybertronians who became exposed to it, the Transmetals and Transmetals 2 amongst the returning Maximals instead lost their "Transmetallized" modes and abilities however still suffered some glitching and amnesia. Those amongst them who were neither Transmetal or Transmetal 2 such as Rhinox and Silverbolt immediately succumbed to the paralysis.
Megatron when the surviving Maximals found him was a still a Transmetal 2, however he fervently sought ways to rid his body of his organic elements and become completely mechanical.
Comparison with normal Transmetals.
Like ordinary Transmetals, Transmetals 2 have a temporary resistance to Megatron's virus, and likewise lose their Transmetallization once they come into contact with the virus. Unlike normal Transmetals however, most of the Transmetals 2 did not gain a third mode.
The only two characters that did gain a third mode where those that would have the two largest toys in the sub-line; Megatron and Tigerhawk. However Megatron's third mode was not used in the cartoon, whilst Tigerhawks third-mode was dropped altogether including from toy itself.
Transmetals 2 in later fiction.
In "Transformers: Universe" featuring the Wreckers, the character Ravage was reborn into a Transmetal 2 body. Along with this the characters Iguanus, Spittor, and Sonar Primeval, where also Transmetals 2. Tarantulas had obtained all three from their stasis pods which has been left behind. This same comic line also introduced the Predacon criminal Cryotek, whose body became a replica of Megatron's Transmetal 2 form from the Beast Wars.
In the IDW Beast Wars comic storyline, the following characters were Transmetals 2 despite only being a protoform beforehand: Optimus Minor, Ramulus, Scourge, Stinkbomb, Prowl, Night Glider, Sonar, and Scarem. No details were given as to why this was. Ravage was also reborn into a Transmetal 2 body.
Toys.
The Transmetal 2 sub-line of Beast Wars toys was released in 1999.

Action of 22 August 1866

The Action of 22 August 1866 occurred during the Chincha Islands War near Funchal, on the island of Madeira.
The Chilean steamer "Tornado" was captured by the Spanish frigate "Gerona", on August 22, 1866 off the island of Madeira. Tornado had arrived in Madeira under the command of Juan MacPherson, an English commander in service of the Chilean Navy. The Chilean ship had sailed to Madeira on 21 August to make provisions of charcoal and food supplements and to recruit sailors for its crew. Although the intent was to remain until August 23, at 14:00 hours on August 22 the watch aboard ship alerted the captain to the presence of an armed vessel, the Spanish frigate Gerona. Captain McPherson decided to leave all his supplies on the dock and sail immediately and the ship got underway 90 minutes after first sighting Gerona. In its haste, Tornado did not receive permission nor inspection from the Portuguese authorities in Madeira and caused the battery of the for to fire two blank charges to induce it to stop, but these were ignored and the Tornado fled.
The firing of the guns however alerted the frigate Gerona, which was the armed vessel the Tornado had observed in port. It had been sent from Cádiz under the command of captain Benito Ruiz de la Escalera specifically to capture Tornado and its sister ship Cyclone. Alerted to the presence of Tornado, Gerona gave chase.
At 22:30 the Spanish frigate fires a blank shot, which was ignored by Tornado. Gerona followed up with three live shots, and Tornado stopped its engines and struck its colors.
The crew of the Tornado was taken abord Gerona and Tornado was manned by a prize crew commanded by naval lieutenant Manuel de Bustillo y Pery. Tornado sailed for Cádiz, where it arrived on August 26, while Gerona returned to Madeira in a fruitless search for Tornado's sister ship Cyclone. 
Aftermath.
The captured Tornado was subsequently taken into the Spanish service under the same name.

Transmission of hepadnaviruses

Transmission of Hepadnaviruses
It means the transmissions of hepadnaviruses among their natural host, human, non-human primates, and birds, including intra-species host transmission and cross-species transmission.
Introduction.
Hepadnaviridae.
A family of viruses which can cause liver infections in humans and animals. There are two recognized genera:
Hepadnaviruses are Group VII viruses that possess double-stranded DNA genomes and replicate using reverse transcriptase. This unique replication strategy, plus they have extremely small viral genome, and a very narrow host range and tissue tropism, make it designated as family hepadnaviridae.
Structure.
With the example of human HBV: the particular feature of the HBV structure is the presence of three different forms in the plasma of infected patients:
Genome.
As with the example of HBV, showing in figure 2, four open reading frames are encoded (ORFs), all ORFs are in the same direction, defining the minus- and plus-strands. And the virus has four known genes, which encode the core protein, the virus polymerase, surface antigens (preS1, preS2, and S) and the X protein.
The minus-strand DNA is complete and spans the entire genome, while the plus strand spans only about two-third of the genome length and have variable 3’ ends. But for the avihepadnaviruses they normally extend plus-strands almost all the way to the modified 5’ end. The minus-strand is linked to the viral reverse transcriptase and can encode all the known viral proteins, but the plus-strain cannot encode viral proteins.
Replication.
With the example of HBV: the mechanisms of infecting hepatocytes are still not well understood, but among the studies, it was revealed that the PreS1 domain of the L protein, plays a critical role in the infection, thus exihibiting different host specificity between different hepadnaviruses. Figure show the general process of the HBV infecting host cell: attachment-entry-uncoating-replicate-assembly-release.
About the viral entry, several proteins have been identified as possible virus receptors, and studies show that the binding of virion with receptors can be neutralized by anti-PreS1 antibodies.
The replication is the unique reverse transcriptase strategy: after uncoating, nucleocapsids are transported to the host cell nucleus, the virion DNA will be converted into covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, the template for the transcription of the viral RNAs. Then undergoes transcription by the host cell RNA polymerase and the transcript is translated by host cell ribosomes; the high capacity of this replicating part contributes many errors which may help the virus adapt to the host.
New virus particles are formed, which acquire lipid from the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell, and the genome is packaged within these particles, which then bud off from the cell; and some part of the new genome may return to the host cell nucleus for replication more genomes.
Phylogenetic tree.
All the members of family hepadnaviridae share remarkable similarities in the genome organization and the replication strategies, however, it also shows the differences between different species, different genotypes, and different subtypes. The species specificity of them are determined, to some extent, at the level of virus entry, involving the PreS1 part of the large envelop protein L, which could be a reason for their specificity of host range.
Orthohepadnavirus.
Viruses in this genus infect mammals, including human, apes, and rodents, with a narrow host range for each virus. The only known natural host for HBV is human, chimpanzees maybe infected experimentally.
The orthohepadnaviruses have been divided into four distinct species, with HBV "(human Hepatitis B virus)", WHV "(Woodchuck Hepatitis virus)", GSHV "(Ground squirrel hepatitis virus )", and WMHV "(Woolly monkey hepatitis virus)" as the prototypes, based on the host range from a limited number of studies.
From the result of molecular studies about the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, information about the number and geographic distribution of HBV genotypes and naturally occurring HBV mutants are gained. Eight HBV genotypes, A to H, have been identified in human and three closely related genotypes in apes are found, like gibbon, orangutan, chimpanzee; and he eight HBV genotypes have further diverged into at least 24 subgenotypes. With different analysis, including analysis of recombinants, the new Genotype J was provisionally assigned to be a genetic variant of HBV which is divergent from known human and ape genotypes, it was isolated from a Japanese patient.
Avihepadnavirus.
Viruses of this genus exclusively infect birds; duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV) are the prototypes. Avihepadnaviruses have been detected in various duck species. As the same with the orthohepadnaviruses, avihepadnaviruses have a rather narrow host range, but its common host are ducks and geese, other possible hosts are herons, stocks and crane.
Transmission.
Transmission of orthohepadnaviruses.
Within human.
Till 2000, there are more than 5.2 million cases of acute hepatitis B infection, and chronically infects approximately 5% of the human population. HBV is the most common one among those hepatitis viruses. It can cause chronic infection of liver in humans, which has become a global public health problem, since chronic hepatitis can cause cirrhosis or death from liver failure within certain times. And it is the major cause of HCC, contributing about 60-80% of the HCC cases around the world.
HBV is transmitted by parenteral contact with body fluids, such as blood and lymph; perinatal exposure of infants to carrier mothers. It is thought that mother-to-child perinatal transmission and the establishment of a lifelong highly infectious carrier state are responsible for the observed high rates of endemicity in high-prevalence regions such as South and East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In some cases breast milk of HBsAg positive mothers has been found to be positive for the virus, but there have not been any reports of HBV transmission through breast-feeding, even before the availability of hepatitis B vaccine for infants.
Cross-species transmission.
Cross-species transmission has not been proven yet, but if this occurs, the chance to eradicate HBV infection by immunization will be diminished due to the difficulty in controlling of natural virus reservoir. And increasing human encroachment on rainforest habitat and fragmentation of declining populations increases the interactions and consequently the risks of disease transmission between wild primates and human populations. Transmission of mammalian hepadnavirus strains between cross-species primate hosts has been found in many cases, recombination of hepadnavirus strains from cross-species primate hosts, further demonstrates that primate associated HBV strains can indeed share hosts in nature, and cross-species transmission of primate-associated HBV strains provides the probability of interspecies recombination.
Between human and non-human mammals.
Since the similarity between human and apes, and common ancestors human and apes shared long time ago, there are possibilities to happen transmission of HBVs among them.
The prevalence of HBV infection in the natural primate habitat is unknown. Most data resulted from the studies performed on samples obtained from captive animals, wild-born or captive-born. Human HBV infects only humans and closely related primates, such as chimpanzee, chacma baboon, and to some extent, tree shrew, but does not infect woolly monkeys. HBV isolates have been shown to infect gibbon apes and chimpanzees, but not convincing evidence of an infection of macaques or other members of the Cercopithecidea family. Macaca sylvanus is able to replicate HBV in vivo replication in primary macaque hepatocytes. However, susceptibility of these animals has not been shown.
In general, these results imply that nonhuman primate HBV variants may be transmittable to humans. At least they infect representatives of the families Pongidae and Hylobatidae. However, at present it remains to be elucidated if nonhuman primate HBV variants are transmittable to humans and whether they cause disease in humans. And till now, no report of HBV transmission from captive animals to humans currently exists.
However the potential for zoonotic disease transmission exists where blood or body fluid exposure is common. Such scenarios could include chronically infected animals kept as family pets, close contact with caretakers, in situations in which chimpanzees are slaughtered and used as bushmeat.
Transmission of avihepadnaviruses.
Within birds.
Many cases about avihepadnaviruses transmission between or within species have been studied.
Between human and birds.
There is no evidence for transmission of avian hepadnavirus between avian and human, but recombination of avihepadnavirus strains between cross-species avian hosts can offer potentials for the transmission between human and bird, considering that many birds are one of the main sources of food for human.
Discussion.
Factors infecting the transmission.
The special replication strategy gives this genus a special character, but also the high replication capacity and high error rate of the viral reverse transcriptase, thus HBVs from this genus have the ability to adapt to the host’s environment, and varies from different hepadnaviruses, thus exhibiting species specificities.
Pre S1 regions of the L protein, exhibiting different host specificity, if proteolytically being removed from HBV particles results in a loss of infectivity. The S protein therefore is needed, but not sufficient for HBV entry. In contrast to the M protein, the L protein is essential for the viral infectivity.
These special proteins plays different role in different viruses, thus determining the different host ranges, if this were strictly true, we would expect that divergence in pre-S would have an impact on cross-species infection, which then can contribute the different transmission of different hepadnaviruses.
Potentials.
A lot of studies have well characterized the horizontal transmission of HBV through parenteral routes and co-infections with different genotypes of HBV have also been reported, including genotypes A and D, genotypes A and G, and genotypes B and C. In Asia, genotypes B and C account for almost all HBV infections. Infection with genotype C may induce more severe liver diseases than infection with genotype B. Recombination between genotypes B and C can occur as the result of co-infection of the two genotypes and recombinant strains may possess an enhanced disease-inducing capacity compared with genotype B. It has also been reported that the predominance of recombinant strains between genotypes B and C might be associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in young carriers in Taiwan.
Though the hepadnaviruses have a very limited host range, with the potential cross-species transmission of hepadnavirus among primates and some families of birds, combined with recombinants, it might change the hepadnavirus host specificity. Interspecies recombination between hepadnaviruses from cross-species hosts would provide a large variation of virus genome, which will change the pathogenicity and transmissibility, and enlarge the host range; the first evidence of potential recombination between Chimpanzee HBV and human HBV genome was documented, recombination between human and non-human primate HBV strains, between GiHBV strains from different genera of gibbons, and between birds HBV strains from different avian sub-families were confirmed. All those experiments provided data allowing us to better understand the background, virus hosts, and zoonotic transmission of the non-human primate HBVs.
Both the co-infection and recombination could change the hepadnaviruses host range, even can enhance the ability of adapting to different host, or to different medical treatment, evolving to different mutants, thus existing great potentials of cross-specises transmissions, and what all these could result is to defeat all our trying to decrease the infection of hepadnavirus, and even destroy our confident to get through the influence of being infected by HBV.
A lot more should be done, to decrease the possibility of transmission, thus enhancing human health.

It is located in farmland at an altitude of c. on a terraced hillside leading up to a prominent summit called Mither Tap. It has been suggested to once have consisted of 12 stones, 4 of which remain standing, with another four fallen, the final four presumed to have been moved. 
The recumbent altar stone is wide, high and deep, it has been estimated to weigh over ten tonnes. It is made is of a type of white grained granite that has been suggested to have been brought some distance to the location. It was suggested that it was designed to create an artificial skyline, horizontally levelled with chockstones; one of which is still visible under the stone. The eastern flanker stone is wide and made of dark grey basalt with a round top. The western flanker stone is wide and made of reddish quartzite bearing inclusions of white quartz and having a pointed top. The stone east of the east flanker is made of red granite. There is also an outlying stone to the southeast of the circle that is high and made of white quartz with roseate seams.
The circle has been estimated to have been between to in diameter. Alexander Thom suggested the circle had been and Fred Coles of only . The circle also displays suggested rock art including cup marks and a noticeable rounded bump on the recumbent stone that resembles the outline of the prominent hill behind it.
Astronomical alignments.
It was discovered in the 1980s that Balquhain had lunar associations. The eastern flanker is aligned to the most southerly moonrise at 172 degrees, whilst the western flanker is aligned to the minor moonset at 232 degrees. The major moonset is aligned over the central hump of the recumbent stone at 190 degrees.

Marie-Andrée Bertrand

Marie-Andrée Bertrand (1925March 6, 2011) was a French-Canadian criminologist, a feminist and anti-prohibitionist.
Biography.
Bertrand started her career as a social worker for female offenders, mainly prostitutes. In 1963, she received a Masters degree from the Université de Montréal. She went on to study criminology at the School of Criminology, University of California, Berkeley, where she got her Ph.D. in 1967. She held a professorship in criminology at the School of Criminology, Université de Montréal. She continued to work, until her death, doing research, teaching and publishing. In 1999/2000 and again in 2000/2001, she taught a course on "Gender, Colour and Legal Norms" in the Masters Program at the International Institute for the Sociology of Law in Onati, Spain.
Main areas of research.
The focus of Bertrand's research was on three areas: drug policy, the treatment of women by criminal justice agencies, and, more generally, critical, feminist theory concerning criminology and sociology of law. Among her main works is an international comparison of female criminality (1979, 2003) and a comparative analysis of women's prisons(1998).
Activism.
Bertrand went beyond mere academic work in several fields. As a young professor, she served as vice president of the Le Dain Commission, which was charged to look into the effects of non-medical drugs. The commission's final report came out in favour of legalizing marijuana. Later, she joined Marco Pannella and his International Antiprohibitionist League, becoming eventually president of the organization. Among her causes was also the abolition of prisons, which goal she called "a necessary utopia". But first and last, she was an untiring feminist. As late as 2007, she is being quoted as saying: "A retired feminist does not easily repose and has no desire to do so".

Church of St James the Less, Sulgrave

The Church of St James the Less, Sulgrave, is the Church of England parish church of Sulgrave, a village and civil parish about north of Brackley, Northamptonshire. The present church dates largely from the 13th and 14th centuries and is a Grade II* listed building.
Architecture.
Sulgrave has had a church since the Anglo-Saxon era, although not on the current site. An earlier stone church is believed to have stood about north of the present one, on higher ground near the windmill.
The church on the present site was built in the 13th century, when the Cluniac Priory of St Andrew, Northampton held the advowson. At least some material from the original church was used in the rebuilding. Most notable is a triangular-headed doorway, characteristic of Anglo-Saxon architecture, that has been re-set as the west door of the west tower. This may date from the 10th century. The bell-openings to the top stage of the tower and the trefoiled lancet windows to the ground stage are Early English Gothic features that date it to the 13th century.
The tower had a spire, but it collapsed in the 14th century. A record from about 1340 reports the church as ""destroyed"", and 20 carts being at ""Helmydene"" (Helmdon, southeast of Sulgrave) to collect stone for its repair. Helmdon stone is a fine freestone and was certainly the best building stone in the area.
The work for which Helmdon stone was supplied may therefore have included the south aisle. This was added in the middle of the 14th century and retains all of its original Decorated Gothic windows. The four-bay arcade between the south aisle and the nave is Perpendicular Gothic and therefore somewhat later. Also in the south aisle is a squint to the high altar in the chancel, and a 14th- or 15th-century piscina, both of which were installed when the aisle had a side altar. The squint was blocked after the Reformation but reopened in 1885. The south door is 14th century. Outside it is the south porch, which is 16th-century Elizabethan with a characteristically Tudor four-centred arch. Over it is a datestone with the initials ER and year 1564. Elizabeth I visited Northampton that year so the initials may commemorate her visit.
The chancel has two south windows: the more easterly is Decorated Gothic and therefore earlier; the more westerly is Perpendicular Gothic. The baptismal font is octagonal and may date from the 1660s.
In 1840 the nave walls were raised by about , the ancient oak roof was replaced with a new deal one and the windows were reduced in height, all to accommodate the installation of galleries to increase the church's capacity. In 1885 the galleries were removed and the oak roof was restored. In the same year to compensate for the loss of the galleries the north aisle was added, re-using the 14th-century north doorway. The three-light east window of the chancel is also 19th-century Gothic Revival.
The two-light east window of the south aisle includes four stained glass coats of arms of successive generations of the Washington family. Each is surrounded by strapwork in white and yellow glass and they are probably 16th-century.
Furnishings.
St James' has an ancient wooden chest, hewn from a solid oak trunk and said to be 14th-century. It has two compartments and is bound with closely spaced iron bands.
In the south aisle is the Washington Pew, a 17th-century pew that was installed when the Washington family held Sulgrave Manor.
In 1929 a wooden screen was installed separating the ground stage of the tower from the nave to create a vestry. It was funded by the Women's Committee of the George Washington Institute and made by craftsmen of Broadway, Worcestershire.
The Colonial Dames of America presented the church with a pipe organ in 1930. This was replaced with a new one in 1975.
Monuments.
Under the floor of the east end of south aisle is the tomb Amee Washington who died in 1564, and her husband Lawrence who died in 1584. The tomb is covered by a slab of Hornton ironstone with monumental brasses set into it. There were originally six brasses in the set: a pair of figures of Lawrence and Amee Washington; a pair of smaller brasses, one their four sons, and one of their seven daughters; a brass of a family coat of arms and one with an inscription. The brasses of Amee Washington, the family coat of arms and the inscription are missing. In 1889 the two brasses of the children and the head of the brass of Lawrence Washington were stolen. They were recovered in 1923 and reinstalled in 1924 but no-one was ever charged with their theft.
In 1659 the Washingtons sold Sulgrave Manor, and in about 1673 it passed to a member of the Hodges family. On the south wall of the south aisle above the Washington pew are three neoclassical wall monuments to members of the Hodges family. The largest and most ornate is that to the brothers John and Rev Moses Hodges, both of whom died in 1724. It is of grey and white marble and has fluted pilasters.
Bells and clock.
In 1552 during the Edwardine Reformation the church was listed as having four bells in the west tower plus a sanctus bell. The churchwardens, John Humfrey and John Mayo, had sold one of the bells for £16 to pay for road and ford repairs in the parish. The buyers, Thomas Stuttesbury and Lawrence Washington, had so far paid £6, and the bell remained in the belfry until the balance was paid.
None of the bells listed in 1552 survives, but their metal may have been re-used in casting the present ones. The Sanctus bell was medieval, but in 1806 it was recast by John Briant of Hertford. One of the Newcombe family of bellfounders of Leicester cast the present third bell in 1610 and the fourth in 1612. Edward Hall of Drayton Parslow in Buckinghamshire cast the fifth bell in 1744. Matthew Bagley of Chacombe cast the second bell in 1769. John Briant of Hertford cast the tenor bell in 1808, making a ring of five. Gillett & Johnston of Croydon recast all five of the ring in 1928. This was increased to six when John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the present tenor bell in 1932.
The present turret clock in the west tower was made and installed in 1928.
Benefice.
The parish is part of the benefice of Culworth, with Sulgrave and Thorpe Mandeville, and Chipping Warden, with Edgcote and Moreton Pinkney. It is in the deanery of Brackley, the archdeaconry of Northampton, and the Diocese of Peterborough.

Kadalpalam is a 1969 Malayalam language film directed by K. S. Sethumadhavan. Sathyan, Prem Nazir, Jayabharathi, Sheela, Bahadoor and Adoor Bhasi star in the lead. The film is an adaptation of the very popular professional stage play of the same name authored by the renowned dramatist K. T. Mohammed which is an adaptation of 1940 Hindi film Prem Nagar. The film was critically well received and was a box office hit. It is probabily best remembered for the performance by Sathyan, who received the first ever State Award for his performance.
Plot.
The story revolves round the family of Narayana Kaimal (Sathyan), a leading advocate who loses his eyesight. Kaimal is a strict disciplinarian and always tries to impose his thoughts and principles on his children and fellow beings. This creates a conflict with others. Kaimal's elder son Raghu (Sathyan) dislikes the obstinate nature of his father leading to constant conflicts between the two. Kaimal's younger son Prabhakaran (K. P. Ummer) who is an advocate and daughter Geetha (Jayabharathi) try to obey their father, but at times they only pretend to obey him. Kaimal now sees the world through the eyes of his faithful servant Appu (Bahadur).
Prabhakaran is in love with Sarala (Sheela), daughter of Kaimal's servant Sreedharan Pillai (Sankaradi). Geetha is in love with Murali (Prem Nazir), the adopted son of Kadeeja (Adoor Bhavani), who lives in the neighbourhood. Appu is warned against telling anything about the love affairs to Kaimal. Raghu believes that they lost their mother at very young age only because of the arrogance of their father. Raghu is married to Prashanthi (Vijayachandrika) who was his father's choice.
Raghu shows his protest by his rude behaviour towards his wife. Kaimal demands to give back the tile factory which he had given to Raghu. But Raghu refuses to part with the factory. Kaimal files a court case against his son.
Geetha marries Murali and Raghu supports them. Kaimal regains his eyesight and is thunderstruck to know about the happenings that took place while he was blind. He decides to pretend to be blind so as to know more about his children. Only Appu is aware that Kaimal is now not blind. Kaimal plots to stop the marriage of Prabhakaran. He offers partnership of the factory to the manager Nanukuttan Nair (Adoor Bhasi) if he could help conduct the marriage of his son, who is a police inspector, with Sarala. Nair agrees to carry out the crooked plan.
The verdict of the court goes against Kaimal. But Prabhakaran hides this from his father. Prabhakaran does not allow Geetha to meet Kaimal and when Kadeeja come and raises voice for justice, Kaimal hits her. Murali attacks Kaimal and now all come to know that Kaimal is not blind. Prabhakaran comes to know about the crooked plan of his father. All the children turn against Kaimal. Unable to stand the setback and the thought that he had failed in his attempts to control his children with an iron hand he suffers a heart attack and dies.
Songs.
The film had four songs penned by Vayalar Ramavarma and set to tune by Devarajan. S. P. Balasubrahmanyam debuted in Malayalam with this film. It was R. K. Shekhar who recommended S.P.B. to Devarajan. Coincidentally, S.P.B.'s most of the famous songs came when he associated with Shekhar's son A. R. Rahman.

<doc id="31155856" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31155856" title="Tampa Smokers">
Tampa Smokers

The Tampa Smokers was a name used between 1919 and 1954 by a series of minor league baseball teams based in Tampa, Florida. The nickname was a nod to the local cigar industry, which was the most important industry in Tampa during the years in which the Smokers were active.
Team history.
Florida State League / Southeastern League (1919 - 1930).
The original Tampa Smokers were a charter franchise of the original Florida State League, which started play in 1919. The name reflected the importance of the cigar industry to the Tampa area. These Tampa Smokers moved to the Southeastern League in 1929 and officially ceased operations along with the league after the 1930 season.
West Coast Baseball League (1932).
In 1932, the Smokers played in the West Coast Baseball League, which was composed of teams based in peninsular Florida. The club disbanded again when the league collapsed after a single season.
Florida International League (1946 - 1954).
The name was revived professionally in 1946, when the Tampa Smokers became a charter member of the Florida International League, a Class C circuit which was notable for fielding a team in Havana, Cuba. This incarnation of the Smokers became one of the first three racially integrated teams in Florida when they signed Afro-Cuban outfielder Claro Duany in 1952.
The Smokers folded along with the Florida International League after the 1954 season, and the name has not been used professionally since. The importance of the cigar industry to Tampa's economy had waned by the 1950s, so when minor league baseball returned to the city in 1957, the new team was called the "Tampa Tarpons".
Semi-pro and amateur baseball.
During times when there was no professional baseball team known as the Tampa Smokers (such as the early 1900s and the 1930s), the name was used by various semi-pro and amateur squads, especially local all-star teams composed of the best Tampa-area players.
During the 1950s and 1960s, alumni of old Smokers squads regularly reunited for exhibition games, usually against the Tampa Tarpons. The Tarpons played in Al Lopez Field, a ballpark built in 1955 and named after the Smokers' (and Tampa's) most famous baseball figure.
Ballparks.
The minor league Smokers played their home games at Plant Field, which was located just across the Hillsborough River from downtown Tampa. Plant Field had been built by Henry B. Plant as part of his Tampa Bay Hotel resort, and the Smokers shared the large multi-use facility with everything from auto racing to the Florida State Fair.
Semi-pro and amateur versions of the Smokers played at smaller ballfields around town, usually Cuscaden Park in Ybor City or Macfarlane Park in West Tampa.
Players.
In all their incarnations, the Tampa Smokers featured many local ballplayers, including many Latin players from Ybor City and West Tampa, and usually had strong community support. Their most famous alumnus was Al Lopez, who grew up in Ybor City and signed with the Smokers in 1925, when he was just 16 years old. Lopez played for his hometown team for two seasons and eventually became the first Tampa native to play in the major leagues, the first to be a major league baseball manager, and the first to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Several other future or former MLB players played for the Smokers at some point during their career, including Camilo Pascual, Tommy Leach, and Hall of Famer Joe Medwick, who served as the team's player-manager in the early 1950s after finishing his major league career. Another notable Smoker alumnus was Cuban Baseball Hall of Famer Manuel Cueto.
Contemporary links.
Tampa Bay Smokers softball team.
The Tampa Bay Smokers, a men's fast-pitch softball team founded in 1995 and based in St. Petersburg, won multiple Amateur Softball Association of America and International Softball Congress championships.
Tampa Bay Rays throwback uniforms.
On July 2, 2011, the Tampa Bay Rays wore Tampa Smokers throwback uniforms to honor the 1951 Florida International League championship team. In a controversial move, the Rays chose to remove the image of a cigar which had underlined the word "Smokers" across the front of the old team's jerseys, calling the resulting "stogie-free" logo a "slightly more contemporary version".

Regular season.
Illinois’ consecutive 20-win season streak was snapped in 1992 when the Illini posted its first losing record in 14 years, going 13-15. Despite their losing record, the Illini outscored their opponents by over 100 points during the season (1,954 - 1,843). To emphasize how close the Illini were to a successful season, of the eleven Big Ten conference games that they lost, eight were by nine points or less, of which four games were lost by three points or fewer. Based on the allegations of recruiting violations from Iowa assistant coach Bruce Pearl, the most satisfying win during the conference season took place on February 23, 1992 when the Illini would defeat the Hawkeyes in an overtime thriller at Assembly Hall.

Scott Statue

The Scott Statue commemorates Robert Falcon Scott. It is located at the intersection of Oxford Terrace and Worcester Street in the Christchurch Central City, New Zealand. The statue, carved by Scott's widow Kathleen Scott, is registered as a Category II historic place. The statue toppled off its plinth in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.
Context.
The explorer Scott had used Christchurch and Lyttelton as his New Zealand base for the British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901–1904 and Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–1913. In between, Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition also used Lyttelton as the base for their attempt to reach the South Pole, but they failed to get there. The objective of the Terra Nova Expedition was to be the first to reach the geographical South Pole. Scott and four companions reached the pole on 1912, to find that a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 33 days. Scott's entire party died on the return journey from the pole. Their deaths resulted in them being treated as heroes throughout the British Empire.
The remaining crew returned to New Zealand and came ashore in British Empire, from where a coded message was cabled to the expedition's organiser in Britain. The fate of the expedition's team became public knowledge on 11 February 1913. A memorial oak was planted in the street leading to the harbourmaster's house, from where the message was relayed. The next memorial was erected in Queenstown, where two stone tablets were attached to a boulder in the Queenstown Gardens. A few months later, a memorial was erected in Port Chalmers, as this was the last harbour where the "Terra Nova" had visited before proceeding to Antarctica.
History.
The Mayor of Christchurch, Henry Holland, called for a public meeting to organise a memorial fund within one week of the news of Scott's death. A committee was formed and over £1,000 was raised. Whilst the form of the memorial or its location had not been decided upon, the committee wrote to Scott's widow and enquired about her thoughts. This resulted in her being engaged to sculpt a statue of her late husband.
The commission was for Kathleen Scott to create a replica of the bronze statue erected in Waterloo Place in London in 1915. The rising costs of metal caused by World War I made marble a more cost effective option. She went to carve the statue in Carrara in Italy in March 1916, as the importation of marble into Britain had been banned. She said about the block that was measuring :
You will be glad to hear that it is a remarkably fine piece of marble, of a good colour and without any flaw whatever. Considering the great size this is very fortunate.
The statue was finished in April 1916, but was not shipped until October of that year due to the war. It was unveiled by the Governor, The Earl of Liverpool, on the corner of Worcester Street and Oxford Terrace on 9 February 1917, facing north and looking towards the building that was then the civic offices. The inscription on the plinth, which is one of his last diary entries, reads:
I do not regret this journey, which shows <br>that Englishmen can endure hardships, <br>help one another, and meet death with <br>as great fortitude as ever in the past.
The inscription had become unreadable by 1922 and a separate marble plaque with this text was installed at the entrance to the reserve. Another plaque lists the names of the five men who died. Recognition grew of Kathleen Scott after the 1995 publication of a biography, and in 1998 a further plaque was added recognising her:
This statue was sculpted by Kathleen Scott FRSBS (1878–1947) Widow of Captain Scott, and was unveiled in 1917.
The statue was not quite finished. The details of the gloves have not been done, and one of the legs rests against a stump to support the figure. Kathleen Scott had offered to undertake this additional work when she returned to Christchurch, but this did never eventuate.
The statue toppled off its plinth in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.
Heritage listing.
On 26 November 1981, the statue was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category II historic place, with the registration number being 1840. It is one of seven memorials that Kathleen Scott sculpted after her husband's death. It also demonstrates Christchurch's link with Antarctic exploration, being the base for Shackleton and Scott in the past, and being the Gateway to the Antarctic by providing the Italian, New Zealand and United States of American bases these days at Christchurch International Airport.

Trinity Theatre

Trinity Theatre is a theatre and arts centre, located in the former Holy Trinity Church in the centre of Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent.
Holy Trinity Church: 1829-1972.
As a developing spa town, Tunbridge Wells was short of church capacity, and had no parish church. In 1818, the Church Commissioners created a fund to provide new churches in growing towns, for which it was decided by the residents and visitors to the town to apply for. Lead by Lord Abergavenny, a subscription fund was started, which raised the £10,591 construction costs. Architect Decimus Burton (1800–1881), who had already been commissioned to designed villas in Calverley Park, agreed to design the building, to a then popular Gothic Revival architecture style. Built in locally quarried sandstone from Calverley Quarry, the first stone was laid on 17 August 1827. Constructed by Mr Barrett of Tunbridge Wells, the finished church which cost just over £12,000 to complete including fitting out, was consecrated in September 1829.
Due to the popularity of Tunbridge Wells in the Victorian age, a number of churches were built in the town. Hence following the fall in congregation numbers post World War II, the town had a number of churches which were in great need of major maintenance. As the largest church in the town, it was decided to decommission it. The church held its last religious service in 1972.
Derelict: 1973-1981.
In 1974 the Church Commissioners declared Holy Trinity "redundant to pastoral needs," thereby allowing for its potential demolition, and redevelopment of the site as housing or offices. However, after a petition was raised by the Royal Tunbridge Wells Civic Society, the commissioners gave the society one year to find a suitable public use for the building. After approving in principle a plan to turn the building into a community theatre and arts centre in 1976, £50,000 was raised in six months, to allow a long term lease to be agreed from January 1977 with the Diocese of Rochester.
Trinity Theatre: 1982-present.
Supported by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council (£15,000), Kent County Council and Arts Council England, over a five-year period the internal redevelopment addressed dry rot and damaged stonework, to turn the building into a theatre with 350 raked seats.
Subsequent grants have allowed developments to include a cafeteria, public bar, and redevelopment of the side vestibules to allow for art shows and local arts classes. In March 1996 an application was approved by the National Lottery for £600,000 of additional internal improvements, which provided a computerised box office, new seats, and an access ramp for wheelchair users.
It its now 25year history, Trinity Theatre has collaborated with performers and groups from Steven Berkoff to the Royal National Theatre, as well as hosting international performing arts, film and visual arts. With over 90,000 people now coming through its doors annually, Trinity is acknowledged as one of the leading arts and performance venues in the South East of England.
Tunbridge Wells Theatre Club.
Originally launched in 1946 as the Tunbridge Wells Drama Club, after the church became available in 1977, the club and its committee became central to the buildings revival. After the restoration of the building in 1982, it renamed itself as Trinity Theatre Club. Today it is one of the most active amateur theatre clubs in the southeast, putting on some six productions per annum.

Shane Alexander (musician)

Shane Alexander is a contemporary American singer-songwriter and musician. Alexander was born in San Diego, California, raised in Pennsylvania and Maryland, and is currently residing in Southern California.
Alexander’s songs range from dark and stirring to subtle and romantic, and are centered around evocative vocals and complex, soulful guitar playing. His smooth vocal style has drawn comparisons to singers Jeff Buckley, Jackson Browne and Art Garfunkel.
Dozens of his songs have appeared on television shows, including "The Real World", "", "Brothers & Sisters", "Bones", "Big Shots, "White Collar", "Criminal Minds", and "Wildfire".
He attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania and Musician's Institute in Hollywood, California.
Early Life and Musical Influences.
Shane Alexander was 5 years old when he first heard Black Sabbath’s Iron Man. Hearing the song jolted the young Alexander’s music consciousness.
Escaping a tumultuous time at home, Alexander often sought refuge at his grandmother’s house, listening to a large collection of vinyl LPs that had belonged to his father. Artists such as Cat Stevens, Harry Chapin, the Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, and The Moody Blues shaped the impressionable young Alexander’s musical tastes. Simon and Garfunkel’s Greatest Hits album particularly moved him, but it was the music of Neil Young whom he cites today as his biggest influence.
At 10 years old, Alexander received his first guitar from his grandmother. Alexander soon taught himself to play guitar and by 12 years old, had joined his first band. Countless followed throughout his teen years.
Career.
The Early 1990s.
Shane Alexander moved from his hometown in Butler, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles in the early ‘90’s. During those early years in California, he attended Musician's Institute in Hollywood and played guitar with the psychedelic instrumental band Trippin, led by virtuoso keyboardist and composer, Jim Michaelson. The band's spectacular live shows drew record crowds in Los Angeles. In 1994, legendary producer Richard Podolor (Alice Cooper, Steppenwolf, Iron Butterfly, Three Dog Night) spotted the band at Coconut Teaszer and invited Alexander to lend his emotive guitar playing to a project he was producing called Young Art. While working with Podolor, Alexander learned invaluable lessons about songwriting and arranging. Later joining the rock band Young Art, he performed as a guitarist and back-up singer. It was not long before Alexander began writing songs for the band as well. Alexander recorded two albums with the group, one produced by Podolor and the other produced by Richie Zito (Cheap Trick, Joe Cocker, Berlin).
In 1997, Alexander formed and fronted Damone with friends from Pennsylvania. The band toured the West Coast club circuit and enjoyed a steadily growing base of loyal fans. They were featured in an interview and fashion layout for Los Angeles Times magazine, and their song "She Likes the Ocean" was used on the extreme sports show Blue Torch, exposing the band to new fans all over the world. The band released a self-titled album and a four-song EP before disbanding in 2002. Just as they were splitting up, the band sold their name for a hefty sum to Damone, a new rock group on RCA records.
Around this time Alexander also began working at Irving Azoff's label Giant Records in the Finance Department. The following year he joined Azoff's executive office as an assistant and runner to the artists – a position that would get the aspiring songwriter up close and personal with The Eagles, Christina Aguilera, Seal, Jewel, Eddie Van Halen, Brian Wilson, Bush, and many other top acts.
2003–2004: Start of a Solo Career.
In early 2003, Alexander began a busy schedule of writing and performing solo shows, sometimes performing with a revolving band on bass, drums, mandolin, piano, accordion, and lap steel.
Alexander produced and recorded a self-titled EP that was released in late 2003. The four song disc, described as a collection of "stripped down acoustic songs with vivid lyrics and haunting melodies," included the track “Last Day on Earth,” which was later covered by 1980s New Wave band Berlin. Shane Alexander toured extensively on both coasts in 2004, beginning to bring his music to a wider audience.
2004–2005: "The Middle Way".
In January 2005, Alexander released his debut full-length album "The Middle Way", a collection of "rootsy, folk rock with intimate vocals and a rich instrumental backdrop." The album was critically acclaimed, particularly in Europe.
"The Open Road," the lead single from "The Middle Way", received national airplay on numerous stations across the Netherlands, and Alexander signed with the Dutch label Lucky Dice Records. Beginning to tour internationally, Alexander performed at clubs and theaters in Canada, UK, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, France, Austria, Sweden, and Denmark and across the United States. Alexander subsequently opened two US tours for Jewel and a west coast/Canada tour with Lisa Marie Presley in 2005.
2006–2007: "Stargazer".
In 2006, Alexander released his second full-length album, "Stargazer" on his own imprint BuddhaLand Records. The album was produced by Heroes & Villains (Billy Mohler and Dan Burns) and featured some of Los Angeles’ most respected musicians: Charlie Paxon (James Blunt, Colin Hay, Anastasia) on drums; Billy Mohler (Macy Gray, Liz Phair, Herbie Hancock) on bass; Krister Axel on piano; Chris Pierce on harmonica; and veteran session ace Kim Bullard (Tori Amos, Goo Goo Dolls, David Crosby, Eddie Money) on Hammond organ. The album was recorded in only four days and tracked mostly live using vintage gear, giving the album a rich, timeless sound. The album was called "stunning" by Performing Songwriter Magazine. Several songs from "Stargazer" were licensed for television and film. More international touring followed.
2008–2009: "Sky Below".
In late 2007, Alexander once again teamed up with Heroes & Villains to produce his third full-length album. Many musicians returned from "Stargazer" – drummer Charlie Paxon, Billy Mohler on electric guitar, piano, keyboards and bass, and Kim Bullard on Hammond organ, with additional performances from Chad Crawford (bass) and Jeff Friedl (drums). Toby Wright (Alice In Chains, Wallflowers, Chris Whitley, Trey Anastasio) mixed the record. Alexander sought to get back to a band sound on this album and added more up-tempo songs than in his previous effort. The album was released on BuddaLand Records in February 2008. Alexander supported the album with extensive touring in The United States and Europe and later that year, opened Seal's U.S. tour. Alone in front of the biggest audiences of his career, Alexander captivated audiences night after night.
Several songs from "The Sky Below" were licensed for television and film.
2010–2011: "Mono Solo".
On June 1, 2010, Alexander released "Mono Solo", his fourth full-length album. Billy Mohler, who co-produced "Stargazer" and "The Sky Below", produced the album. The new collection marked a quantum leap, both in songwriting and in production, for Alexander. Inspired by stories picked up while touring the U.S. and Europe, the effect of the economic crisis on those around him, and the tragic death of a lifelong friend, each track on "Mono Solo" conveys a sense of reverence for life, love, and stability. "Corey's Song" is Alexander's farewell ode to Corey James Daum, who was killed in a drunk driving accident in Nashville. The album is dedicated to his friend.
The track “Carrollton” was licensed for the television show "One Tree Hill on the WB Network before the album was even released.
In late 2010 Alexander signed with Warner Chappell Europe and Rough Trade Records Benelux. The album was released internationally in Spring 2011 and the single "Good as Gold" reached 126 on the Dutch pop chart. Alexander has been touring constantly across the United States and internationally in support of the album. In 2011, Shane Alexander opened for Styx and Yes in 22 cities during their cross-country Summer Tour.
2012: "The Greater Good".
In spring of 2012, The Greater Good released their self-titled debut on the German label, Stockfisch Records. Recorded in Northeim, Germany the previous spring, the record features Alexander, NYC songwriter Eugene Ruffolo, and Dutch songwriter Dennis Kolen. The album, recorded in less than a week, has a stripped folk-pop sound with lush three-part vocal harmonies. The success of the first single, "All the Lonely Times" (Kolen) and second single, "Nowhere Fast" (Alexander/Silver) in the Netherlands led to the band's first Dutch tour in the fall of 2012.
2013: "Ladera".
In April 2013, Alexander released his 5th album, "Ladera." The production of the new album is far more sparse and ambient than his previous work, and pays tribute to many of Alexander's more psychedelic influences. Teaming up for the 4th time with producer Billy Mohler, and recorded at Mohler's Groundswell Studios in Culver City, CA, the latest collection also showcases Peter Adams (Five For Fighting, Josh Groban, Rickie Lee Jones) on keyboards and newcomer, Jesse Siebenberg (Supertramp, A Fine Frenzy, Lissie) on lapsteel. In spring of 2013, Alexander signed with Dutch label Harlem Recordings, a division of Suburban Records.

St Mark Passion pastiche

The "St Mark Passion" pastiche were pastiches by Johann Sebastian Bach on the anonymous Hamburg "St. Mark Passion" formerly attributed to Reinhard Keiser, now believed to have been by Friedrich Nicolaus Bruhns.
Background.
In 1754, the musician and theorist Lorenz Christoph Mizler published as an addendum in the most recent volume of his "Neu eröffnete musikalische Bibliothek" a series of three obituaries of recently deceased members of his "Korrespondierende Sozietät der Musicalischen Wissenschaften". Amongst them was a notice penned by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach and Johann Friedrich Agricola, both men then employed in the service of Frederick II of Prussia. Both men had been students of the subject of their article (the former being his second-eldest son, the latter starting his studies with the subject in 1741), and were therefore qualified to write his obituary. The subject of the article was Johann Sebastian Bach. As a conclusion, Emanuel Bach and Friedrich Agricola catalogued all Sebastian Bach's published and unpublished works. Amongst the latter is found the following notation:
Of the aforementioned five Passions, two exist both in libretto and score forms, the "St Matthew Passion" (BWV 244) and the "St John Passion" (BWV 245). A third is only in libretto form, the "St Mark Passion" (BWV 247). A fourth is a manuscript copy in the hands of Johann Sebastian and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, the "St Luke Passion" (BWV 246), but the authorship of the original is questionable. The identity of the fifth is still debated. Over the centuries since the obituary was written, more and more research has come to light, not only about the true extent of Bach's work, but also about his compositional style and habits. The discovery (for example) that the music for the "Christmas Oratorio" (BWV 248) is primarily parody music has led to a new understanding of Bach's compositional process and requirements. Further discoveries have led to the realization that Bach also at time resorted to pastiches, or adding original work to the works of others. This is about one of those cases: the pastiches on the anonymous Hamburg "St. Mark Passion" formerly attributed to Reinhard Keiser, now believed to have been by Friedrich Nicolaus Bruhns.
Composition.
Bach held deep regard for the chief Hanseatic League cities of Hamburg and Lübeck throughout his life. In his mid and late teen years, he had opportunities to visit both cities while a student at St. Michael's Church School, Lüneburg (a period from 1700–1702). From November 1705 to February 1706, he again made the trip north from Arnstadt to Lübeck (and possibly to Hamburg as well). He again visited Hamburg in 1720 to try out for the position of Organist at the Jakobikirche, a visit during which he won the rarely afforded praise of the aged Johann Adam Reincken. It is possible that he became acquainted with a work during his earlier visits to Hamburg that would occupy a central place in his musical library for the rest of his life. The work in question was a setting of the St. Mark Passion written during the early part of the 18th century. This work (outside of Bach's own copy and his pastiches) has come down to us in two other forms: an anonymous manuscript score in Hamburg and a copied score in the county of Hohenstein, Thuringia. Since the work is anonymous, many scholars had come to believe (based on stylistic considerations) that the work was by the one-time Kapellmeister of the Hamburg Opera, Reinhard Keiser. However, based on the discovery of a libretto book dated around 1707, scholars now assign authorship of the work to Friedrich Nicolaus Bruhns, the music director of the Hamburg Cathedral from 1685 to 1718 and uncle of Nikolaus Bruhns, the favorite pupil of Dietrich Buxtehude.
Weimar, 1710–1714.
No evidence exists that Bach was required (in his official duties) to provide Passion music for his early posts in Weimar (1703), Arnstadt (1703–1707), Mühlhausen (1707–1708), and Weimar (1708–1717). However, he did receive requests to do so on two occasions: once on commission by Frederick III, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (resulting in the so-called "Weimarer Passion" (BWV deest, BC D 1), and another resulting in the work in question.
The origins of the commission for this work (BWV deest, BC D 5a) are unknown. All documentary material for Bach's time in Weimar during this period (1708–1717) were destroyed in a 1774 fire that consumed the palace that Bach was employed in during this period, the Wilhelmsburg. The only evidence that has come down is a set of parts used in performance now housed in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin.
There are many questions still surrounding this work. Many scholars question whether the set of parts that we have are complete. Even the dating is questionable. Originally, scholars assigned the dating to Good Friday (14 April) 1713, but is now put down to Good Friday (25 March) 1712 or even a year or two earlier., or even Good Friday (30 March) 1714
In total, there are three manuscript sets that have come down to us for this work. One is in the form of a 57-page score in the hand of Wilhelm Rust which bears the title "Dr. Rust / Passion / nach dem Evangelium / St. Marcus / componirt / von ?" and on page 2 "Passion nach dem Ev. Marcus / Aus J. S. Bach's größtentheils eigenhändig geschriebenen Stimmen / in Partitur gesetzt / von / Dr. Wilhelm Rust, Cantor zu St. Thomas / in Leipzig". This is housed at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin under the Catalogue number D B N. Mus. ms. 10624. Another has come down to us in the form of a 31-page set of parts dating from 1710–1712 in the hands of Bach, Johann Martin Schubart, and Anonymous Weimar III. The title page of this one bears the inscription "Passion Christi / secundum Marcum aus Matthäum / à 5 Strom 4 Voci / di Sigre / R. Kaiser." in the hand of Christian Gottlob Meißner. Upon Bach's death, it passed into possession of Emanuel Bach, at whose death it was purchased (among other Bachiana) by Georg Pölchau, from whom it went into the possession of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (with Catalogue number D B Mus. ms. 11471/1 and 2). A third one has come down to us in the form of a 45-page set of parts dating from 1713 in the hands of Bach, Anonymous Weimar I, Johann Heinrich Bach, Anonymous Weimar III, and Christian Gottlob Meißner. The title page of this one bears the inscription "Passion Christi / secundum Marcum aus Matthäum / à 5 Strom 4 Voci / di Sigre / R. aus? Kaiser." This set of parts came into Emanuel Bach's possession after Sebastian's death, and followed the same fate as the one above. It is housed at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin under Catalogue number D B Mus. ms. 11471/1.
All three sources remain possibly incomplete. Whether any of the sources mentioned above represent the original form of the work is also doubtful. Even instrumentation is questionable. The oboe solo part required for some of the movements is included in the violin I part, which means that it is possible that the violin I player(s) were intended to be used for these parts as well, or that possibly the oboe parts are missing (meaning that there were one or even two oboe players intended for the work). Also noticeably missing is a figured organ part, a bassoon part, a violoncello part, and a part for viol. The lack of an organ part has been variously explained by the fact that from the middle of 1712 until, probably, 1714, the Organ of the Weimar Schloßkirche (the "Himmelsburg") was being renovated.
Modern editions of this work include the two Bach movements in the Neue Bach-Ausgabe volume II/9, work 7, and by Carus-Verlag.
Text and scoring for BC D 5a.
The author of the libretto for this work is unknown. The work is in 32 movements:
The libretto has the Biblical text interspersed with free verse and chorale texts. The chorale texts are taken from "Was mein Gott will, das g'scheh allzeit" by Albert, Duke of Prussia (verse 1), "Christus, der uns selig macht" by Michael Weiße (Verse 8), "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" by Paul Gerhardt (verses 9 and 10), and "O Traurigkeit, o Herzeleid" by Johann Rist. Unlike Bach's later Passion works, there is no division of the work into two parts. Christian Friedrich Henrici, the man who would later provide Bach with many of his cantata and oratorio texts, would use the text for Movement 9 (slightly altered) in one of his own collections (entitled "Sammlung Erbaulicher Gedanken über und auf die gewöhnlichen Sonn- u. Fest-Tage, in gebundener Schreib-Art entworffen"). The two Bach additions (Movements 14 and 29) are catalogued as BWV deest serie II: 02 and 03.
The work is scored for a very small ensemble. However, not have all the parts used may be extant. It is possible that there were two oboes used in the performance; they may have also (in addition to Movement 19) been used in the Choral parts and the Sinfonias. As it is now, it is scored for:SATB soloists and choir, two violins, two violas, and basso continuo.
About orchestration, Bach wrote in 1730 a little tract entitled ""Kurtzer, iedoch höchstnöthiger Entwurff einer wohlbestallten Kirchen Music; nebst einigem unvorgreiflichen Bedenkken von dem Verfall derselben." " ("Short, but most Necessary Draft on a well-regulated Church Music, with some modest Thoughts on the Decline of the same"). In it, he stated both the ideal size of church choirs and orchestras and those he were dealing with at the time (in Leipzig). He suggested that an ideal choir would consist of 1–2 singers per part (or 4–8 total singers), while he was typically dealing with 12–16 per part. He also states that a well-regulated church music would be performed by:
2 or even 3 for the "Violino I", 2 or 3 for the "Violino II", 2 for the "Viola I", 2 for the "Viola II", 2 for the "Violoncello", 1 for the "Violone", 2, or, if the piece requires it, 3, for the "Hautbois" ("Oboe"), 1, or even 2, for the "Basson" ("Bassoon"), 3 for the "Trompeten" ("Trumpets"), and 1 for the "Pauken" ("Timpani"), for a total of 18 persons at least. also stated that if the piece required it, there would be 2 Flute players.
So for a work such as this one, he would need three violin I, three violin II, two viola I, two viola II, two violoncelli, one violon, two oboes, two bassoons, and harpsichord (as the harmony instrument in the continuo), and two sopranos, two altos, two tenors, and two basses in the choir and the same amount as the concertino for the solo voice parts.
Leipzig 1726 (BC D 5b).
Nearly three years into his post as ""Cantor (church)" of the Thomasschule zu Leipzig and "Directoris Chori musici" in Leipzig", Sebastian Bach ran into a quandary. He had begun and nearly completed a score for a "St Matthew Passion", a project which he began in 1725 but put aside for a revival of his "St John Passion", when he again for some unknown reason set aside the project (he would complete it and first perform his "St Matthew Passion" on 11 April 1727). Instead he decided to revive his Weimar pastiche. This work was performed on 19 April 1726. For this work, he changed two movements (Nos. 14 and 29 of the Weimar work) and, to fit it to the Church Ordinance for Good Friday Vespers services in Leipzig, he split it into two parts by adding a chorale. The violin I part for this work (BWV deest, BC D 5b) is missing in all his new additions (and has been reconstructed), but on the whole, the parts are more complete. This work has come down to us in the form of a vocal score and parts set dating from before 1726 in the hands of Johann Sebastian Bach, Christian Gottlob Meißner, and Johann Heinrich Bach, and is currently stored in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin under the Catalogue number D B Mus. ms. 11471/2. The title page (like the Weimar one) reads "Passion Christi / secundum Marcum aus Matthäum / à 5 Strom 4 Voci / di Sigre / R. Kaiser." The text goes as follows:
Prima Parte
Seconda Parte
Like the Weimar work, this work also was scored for SATB soloists and choir, oboes I/II, violins I/II, violas I/II, and basso continuo. Like the Weimar work, the oboes were also included in the Choral and Sinfonia sections. However, the parts this time also included a figured organ part. In two of the three new additions (Movements 10 and 15), the first violin part is missing and has been reconstructed. Of the new additions (Movements 10, 15, and 30), Alfred Dürr noted that the bass line of Movement 10 mirrored exactly the bass line of the sacred song from the "Musicalisches Gesangbuch G.C. Schemelli", "So gehst du nun, mein Jesus, hin" BWV 500 (it is included in the BWV catalogue as BWV 500a). Movement 15 was used as a replacement of Movement 14 of BC D 5a, and is catalogued as BWV 1084 (no BC number yet) and is also marked "alla breve" as is its predecessor, but instead of half notes as the main beat, the quarter note gets the main beat. Movement 30 was used to replace Movement 29 of BC D 5a, and is catalogued as BWV deest serie II: 04 (similar case as far as notation to Movement 15).
Modern editions include the three Bach movements in NBA II/9, work 8 and Carus-Verlag (the new movements in the Appendix, the rest being the same as the Weimar work in the main body).
Leipzig 1747–1748 (BC D 5).
Bach again revived this pastiche on either 31 April 1747 (at the St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig) or 12 April 1748 (at the St. Thomas Church, Leipzig). Of all the pastiches, this one was the most complex and involved. In many ways, it was more a true pastiche than the previous two were. In addition to his own music (two movements), Bach incorporated seven Arias from George Frideric Handel's Brockes Passion HWV 48 into the original. This work (BWV deest (Serie II: 005), BC D 5) has come down only in two forms. One is a complete harpsichord part of 10 pages dating from between 1743 and 1748 housed at the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin under Catalogue number D B N. Mus. ms. 468. This part is written in the hands of Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach (notes), Johann Sebastian Bach (figures), and Wilhelm Rust (title page). Its title page reads "Marcus-Passion / angeblich von R: Keiser" and underneath this "NB enthält 6 Arien aus der Brockes'schen / Passion von Händel". After Bach's death, it came into possession of an unknown individual, from whom it entered into possession of Wilhelm Rust, whose heir Maria Rust next took possession of it. It then entered into the possession of an A. Martin in Weimar, from whence it entered into (in succession) the possessions of an A. Thiele and then B. Thiele (also in Weimar), from whence it entered into the possession of the Antiquarian Bookshop of Joseph Abraham Stargardt in Berlin, from whence it entered into the possession of the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin in 1987.
The other source material is a one-page fragment of the Bassoon I part of the Aria "Was Wunder, daß der Sonnen Pracht" from Handel's HWV 48 in the hand of Johann Sebastian Bach dating from between 1743 and 1748. This part followed pretty much the same path as the part above, however after it came into possession of B. Thiele, it next entered into possession of C. Thiele in Kiel. It is marked under catalogue number Privatbesitz C. Thiele, BWV deest (Serie II: 005).
The text for this work is as follows:

Catostylidae

Catostylidae is a family of small jellyfish. Members of this family are characterized by their thick, sausage-like oral arms.
Description.
Members of the Catostylidae family are small marine jellyfish with domed bells. The eight short oral arms are broad and three-sided. There is a network of branching canals linked with the primary ring canal, but these are not joined to the gastrovascular cavity except through the sixteen or thirty two radial canals. Some of these radial canals do not extend to the edge of the bell. There are eight sense organs, known as rhopalia, which have canals extending to the margin of the bell.
These jellyfish swim in jerks by contracting their circular and radial muscles, which decreases the volume of water enclosed under the bell, before relaxing them again and repeating the sequence. They have no control over the direction of locomotion and drift with the currents and tides.

Christian Cambillau

Christian Cambillau (born February 22, 1951) is a French scientist for the CNRS (French National Scientific Research Centre) in Structural Biology. He received the Silver Medal of CNRS for his work on structural biology, especially the structures of human lipase/colipase, lectins and the development of moleculargraphics software.
Early life.
Christian Cambillau was born in Perpignan to Madeleine Cambillau a social worker and August Cambillau an officer of the French airforce. He studied part of his childhood in different places (including Perpignan) and later in Paris when his family moved there. He obtained his Master in biology and chemistry at the University of Orsay, then continued on to do a Ph.D. at the same university in bio-mimetic chemistry (crown-ether and cryptates).
Career.
After his Ph.D. (1978) he spent one year at ONERA for his military service. He was then hired by CNRS in the chemistry department (1980, January 1st). In 1982 he moved to Sweden to begin a two year post-doc in the lab of Prof. Carl-Ivar Bränden, a pioneer of protein crystallography. Whilst there he worked to develop the TOM option in FRODO software, producing an automatic flexible protein-ligand docking software. He also participated to different works on protein crystallography and modelling.
After Sweden he returned to France to work in the relatively new field of structural biology, joining a group in the CRMC2 laboratory located in Marseille on the Luminy Campus (Marseille University of science). He worked there for four years and developed a new molecular graphics program TURBO-FRODO. He then moved with the protein crystallography group when it was relocated to the Marseille North University Department. It's at the North University Department that he led his first team at the LCCMB lab (Laboratory of Crystallography and Crystallization of Biological Macromolecules) with this becoming one of the key points of his career. Whilst director he moved in 1995 to the Campus of Joseph Aiguier, where LCCMB became AFMB (Architecture et Fonction de Macromolecule Biologiques). He resigned the direction of the AFMB in 2004, with AFMB moving to the Luminy Campus in 2005. Since 2008 he is Head of Marseille-Nice Génopole.

Reward.
-Silver medal of CNRS:
“"Christian CAMBILLAU, 44, CNRS research director, supervises the Laboratory of crystallography and crystallization of biological macromolecules, an associated CNRS-University of Aix-Marseille 2 research unit. He is an international specialist in the field of structural biology (crystallography) and has developed a software for modeling molecules using data from X rays or NMR, making France one of the very few countries to have developed software in the field of biological crystallography. His most innovative and spectacular work concerns the interactions between proteins and sugars (structural glycobiology) and the structural analysis of lipases (enzymes which hydrolyse fat). Thus, he was able to crystallize for the first time a lectin and glycoprotein complex, making it possible to carry out a precise three-dimensional analysis of interactions between proteins and complex sugars. He has also described the structural movements which can activate pancreatic lipase in the presence of its lipid substrate. This research is extremely important from both a medical and a biotechnological point of view."”

The Olympic Symphonium

The Olympic Symphonium is a Canadian indie folk trio from Fredericton, New Brunswick. The band consists of Nick Cobham (guitar), Kyle Cunjak (bass, guitar), and Graeme Walker (guitar, bass). All three musicians swap instruments and take turns singing and songwriting, and are often joined by Dennis Goodwin (banjo) and Bob Deveau (drums).
History.
The band was formed in 2005 when Walker decided that some of his recent songs didn't fit the style of his primary band, Grand Theft Bus, and invited Cunjak and Cobham, two friends who had also written a number of songs that didn't fit their other bands, to join a new side project. Cunjak is also in the band Share, while Cobham is in the band Force Fields.
They released their debut album, "Chapter One", in 2007, and followed up with "More in Sorrow Than in Anger" in 2008 and with "The City Won't Have Time to Fight" in 2011. 
They recorded "The City Won't Have Time to Fight" in an abandoned house in Fredericton. To mark the album's release, they organized a weekend music event, Shivering Songs, which featured performances by a variety of the band's friends and collaborators, including Rose Cousins, Catherine MacLellan, David Myles, Snailhouse, Olenka Krakus and Grant Lawrence.

Oru Penninte Katha is a Malayalam language film released in 1971. It was written by S. L. Puram Sadanandan and directed by K. S. Sethumadhavan. The film takes some plot elements from the Hollywood film "The Visit" (1964).
Plot.
Savithri (Sheela) is the only daughter of Govindan (T.S.Muthiah) who is employed in the tea estates owned by Madhavan Thampi (Satyan). One day Madhavan Thampi spots Savithri singing near the stream and is attracted towards her. Raghavan (Govindankutty) is the local leader of the labourers. Rajan (K.P.Ummer), another leader of the estate workers is involved in a criminal case framed against him by the estate owners and the police is in search of him. Rajan gets refuge in Savithri's house through Raghavan. Love blooms between Savithri and Rajan. One day Madhavan Thampi happens to see Rajan in his hideout. Savithri fears that Thampi may report it to the police. Her friend Thankamma (Jayabharathi) advises her to approach Thampi and plead with him to not report to the police. Accordingly Savithri reaches Thampi's bungalow and is raped by him. Thampi then informs the police and Rajan is arrested.
Savithri becomes pregnant, but Thampi disowns her. Govindan commits suicide and the helpless Savithri leaves town after giving birth to a child whom she leaves in the hospital. Thampi marries Subhadra (Kaviyoor Ponnamma) and they live happily with their daughter Sreedevi (Junior Sheela). Mismanagement of the business by Thampi results in huge losses. Thampi's estate and property is bought by a rich woman Gayathri Devi who comes from Bombay. Thampi contests the Assembly elections and loses. Raghavan, who is a nominee of Gayathri Devi, wins.
Gayathri Devi repays Thampi's debts too and she files a suit against Thampi for recovery of money she paid to clear his debts. Thampi's house is about to be attached when Subhadra approaches Gayathri Devi with a request to wait till their daughter gets married.
Gayathri Devi narrates to Subhadra the reason behind her actions. Gayathri Devi is none other than Savithri, the daughter of Thampi's poor servant Govindan, who was abandoned by him mercilessly. After abandoning her new born baby, Savitri became a prostitute and finally inherited a huge amount of wealth from a benefactor in Bombay.
Thampi writes a letter to Gayathri Devi, in which he tells Sreedevi that it is her own daughter whom he adopted from the hospital. . Gayathri Devi transfers all her wealth in Sreedevi's name, but Sreedevi refuses to accept it and Gayathri Devi returns to Bombay.

Cyclone Rewa

Severe Tropical Cyclone Rewa affected six countries and caused 22 deaths on its 28-day journey across the South Pacific Ocean in December 1993 and January 1994. Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28 December south of Nauru. After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the Solomon Islands, crossing the 160th meridian east from the South Pacific basin into the Australian region. The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on 2 January. It maintained this intensity for about 12 hours before an increase in wind shear induced its weakening by 3 January. The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4 January, before it passed over New Caledonia between 5–6 January. After affecting New Caledonia, Rewa weakened to a tropical depression and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10 January.
Over the following days, the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of Papua New Guinea. Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone. It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make landfall near Mackay, Queensland, the cyclone began interacting with an upper-level trough on 18 January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. Rewa transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on 20 January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to New Zealand three days later.
The cyclone caused the deaths of 22 people on its course, affecting parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Eastern Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Nine people in a banana dinghy en route to Rossel Island went missing at the height of the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island. In Queensland, three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm, and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe. One death took place in New Caledonia, while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea. After this usage of the name Rewa, the name was retired.
Meteorological history.
During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service's Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Nadi, Fiji (TCWC Nadi), started to monitor a tropical depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone about 575 km (355 mi) to the south-east of Nauru. Over the next few days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before TCWC Nadi reported that the system had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Rewa. Over the next few days, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29 December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Bureau of Meteorology's Brisbane tropical cyclone warning centre (TCWC Brisbane) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.
On 30 December, the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS); early the next day TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had developed into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, and an eye became visible on satellite imagery. The system then abruptly turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2 January both the JTWC and TCWC Brisbane reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph), equivalent to a category 4 tropical cyclone on the SSHS. Meanwhile TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205 km/h (125 mph) with a central pressure of 920 hPa (27.17 inHg), which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. When the data was reanalyzed, TCWC Brisbane lowered their estimate of the wind speed to 175 km/h (110 mph), which made Rewa a category 4 severe tropical cyclone. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 12 hours before the system started to weaken during 3 January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone started to move towards the south-east, before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160°E.
During 4 January, Rewa moved back into the South Pacific basin and continued eastward as a weakening category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with TCWC Nadi estimating the 10-minute sustained windspeeds at 150 km/h (90 mph). During the next day, its eye became obscured after the mountains of New Caledonia affected Rewa's circulation by creating a hot and dry Foehn wind. TCWC Nadi reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become a tropical storm. The system subsequently made landfall in the vicinity of Saint Vincent Bay on New Caledonia's south-western coast, before it emerged near Thio from the east coast during 6 January. By 7 January, Rewa's circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies; as a result both the JTWC and TCWC Nadi reported that Rewa had weakened into a depression. Over the next 3 days, the residual low-level circulation was steered towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly trade wind flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between New Zealand and Kermadec Islands. During 10 January, Rewa's remnants moved out of the South Pacific basin and back into the Australian region while starting to re-intensify into a tropical cyclone, as a mid to upper level trough over eastern Australia increased in size.
As moved into the Australian region, Rewa began to move in a long arc to the northwest and then to the north, and on 13 January, both the JTWC and TCWC Port Moresby reported that the system had reintensified into a tropical cyclone around Papua New Guinea's southern islands. Later that day, Rewa executed a sharp clockwise turn near Tagula Island and started to move towards the southeast and TCWC Brisbane's area of responsibility while gradually intensifying further. During 15 January, TCWC Brisbane reported that the system had reintensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 tropical cyclone again. Later that day, the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system. During the next day the JTWC reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph). TCWC Brisbane then reported later that day, that Rewa had peaked with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 205 km/h (125 mph), which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south-southwest, and started to gradually weaken. By 18 January the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a tropical storm while throughout that day TCWC Brisbane assessed Rewa as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During the next day, TCWC Brisbane reported that Rewa had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south-east about 265 km (165 mi) to the east of Mackay, Queensland. Over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south-southeast along the Queensland coast while maintaining its intensity. During 21 January, TCWC Brisbane and the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened below cyclone strength, as the system moved back into the South Pacific basin for the third and final time. Rewa's remnants were last noted late on 23 January, by TCWC Wellington, bringing heavy rain to New Zealand, while dissipating over water about to the east of Wellington, New Zealand.
Preparations and impact.
Twenty-two people lost their lives in accidents caused by Cyclone Rewa, while it affected parts off the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Due to the impact of this storm, the name Rewa was retired.
The Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand.
The Solomon Islands were affected by the developing tropical cyclone between 28 – 30 December and was the first Island country to be impacted by Rewa. As it developed into a tropical cyclone on 28 December, the system passed to the north of the outer lying atolls of Malaita Province in the Solomon Islands. Rewa then passed over the southern tip of Malaita Island, before passing to the south of Guadalcanal Island and the north of Rennell Island during 29 December.
Cyclone Rewa started to affect New Caledonia on 5 January, before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300 mm (12 in) of rain on parts of the archipelago, which made all of the major rivers overflow and burst their banks. Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, while on the Loyalty Island of Mare, waves from Rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at Tadine's port.
The system had no effect on Vanuatu while it passed through the Solomon Islands between 28 – 30 December; however the southern islands of Vanuatu were affected by the cyclone after it had passed through New Caledonia during 5 January. As it moved towards the north-west between 6–8 January, Rewa brought strong winds that were near gale force to parts of the Tafea Province. Rewa also brought strong north-westerly winds and high seas to Efate Island between 8–9 January as it passed about 175 km (110 mi) to the southeast of Port Vila causing damage to the intertidal zone of the city's harbour.
Between 19–24 January, Rewa's remnants, a slow moving weather front over Fiordland and a southerly brought widespread rainfall and flooding to New Zealand's South Island. In Westland, Fiordland and the Southern Lakes, landslides and flooding occurred on 21 January, while several roads and bridges were damaged.
Papua New Guinea.
Cyclone Rewa affected Papua New Guinea on two separate occasions while it was active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28 December and 1 January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14 January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people not to go to beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100 km/h (60 mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500 people homeless and caused 17 deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00 UTC on 30 December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55 km/h (35 mph).
Australia.
During the opening days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards parallel to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600 km (370 mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it was too far away from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4 January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18  January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.
On 19 January Rewa started to affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However it did not make its predicted landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100 km (60 mi) of the coast. Two men off Yeppoon's coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army Black Hawk helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain, leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was Lady Elliot as it bore the brunt of the wind, while on Heron Island, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19 January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over 144 mm (5.7 in) in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's flood water and got trapped in a storm drain. Within Brisbane, 100 homes and 20 cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a Sheffield Shield cricket match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after The Gabba resembled a small lake.

In April 2009, Astral Media, through a subsidiary The Family Channel Inc., was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called "Family Extreme", described as "a national, English-language Category 2 specialty programming service devoted to entertainment, humour, travel, games, science and technology. Programming will be from around the world and targeted to children aged 6 to 17 years and their families." On March 11, 2011, Astral announced it would launch Disney XD on June 1, 2011, using the Family Extreme licence. In late 2011, Astral also launched a Disney XD video on demand app for the Xbox 360 video game console.
In March 2013, Disney XD launched a West coast feed of their channel, a simulcast of the East Coast feed, on Telus Optik TV.
Following the Competition Bureau's approval of Bell Media's takeover of Astral, Bell announced on March 4, 2013 that it would put Disney XD, along with five other channels (Family, Disney Junior's English and French services, MusiMax and MusiquePlus) up for sale. The networks will be held in a blind trust by Pierre Boivin until they are sold. On November 28, 2013, DHX Media announced that it would acquire Disney XD and its sister networks for $170 million.
On October 27, 2013, Disney XD (Canada) premiered its first original movie "Bunks".

Pavel Muratov

Pavel Pavlovich Muratov (), also known as Paul Muratov ( - February 5, 1950), was a Russian essayist, novelist, art historian, critic and playwright.
Born in Bobrov in the Voronezh Oblast into the family of a military doctor, Muratov attended a Cadet Corps and graduated from the Petersburg State Transport University in 1903. He traveled abroad in 1905-06, after which he moved to Moscow and worked at the Rumyantsev Museum until 1914. He became friends with the writers Boris Zaytsev, Vladislav Khodasevich, and Nina Berberova (who called him "one of the most remarkable men I ever met"), as well as the artist Nikolai Ulyanov. From 1906 he began to publish in journals like "Vesy", "Zolotoe Runo", and "Apollon". He collaborated with Igor Grabar on the latter's "History of Russian Art", and in 1913-14 he helped publish the journal "Sofia", dedicated to early Russian art. He served in World War I and was awarded medals.
After 1918 he helped Grabar restore cathedrals and was associated with the only bookshop in Moscow which remained unregulated by the state - the Writer's Library. Having been banished in 1922, he spent the 1920s in Berlin, where he became part of the émigré community. By the 1930s he had moved to Paris - during the late 1920s and early 1930s he brought out several books in French, including ones on Fra Angelico and Russian icons, as well as a novel in Russian, "Egeria" (1922). During World War II he was in Ireland, working as a military journalist ; he wrote an account of the Russian campaigns for Penguin Books.
Clive James has called Muratov an example of "just how brilliant somebody can be and still be a forgotten man," and called his book "Obrazy italii" (Images of Italy) (in three volumes, published in 1911, 1912, and 1924) "one of the most dazzling books of its type ever written. As a book on the Italian Grand Tour it not only stands directly in the tradition of Goethe, Gregorovius, Burckhardt and Arthur Symons, but it is better than any of them."

Jack &amp; Jason's Pancakes &amp; Waffles

Jack & Jason's Pancakes & Waffles is an independently owned and operated artisan foods company based out of San Francisco. The pancake and waffle mixes produced out of their Dogpatch facility are made entirely of all-natural, organic ingredients. The company is also a staunch proponent of the American economic recovery movement, working exclusively with domestic farmers and distributors and focusing significantly on job creation for local residents.
History.
Bolstered by positive reception from friends and family, the two partners decided to package and sell their homemade mixes in a limited capacity. Several weeks of meticulous testing and refinement led Harper and Jervis to ultimately develop the five distinct flavors that would become their base product line. Starting small with handmade packaging and a customer base built solely upon word of mouth, Harper and Jervis soon encountered growing public demand for their product.
Determined to meet the needs of their growing customer base, the two partners designed and implemented a specialized manufacturing line—when the first production batch rolled out, Jack and Jason's Pancakes & Waffles was officially up and running. Currently, the company boasts a growing staff of enthusiastic workers and several wholesale distributors across San Francisco and northern California including Boudin Bakery in Fisherman's Wharf, Mollie Stone's Markets down the Peninsula, New Leaf Community Markets around Santa Cruz, and Nugget Markets in the Sacramento metropolitan area. Jack & Jason's is also branching out to other states; in addition to nationwide online shipping, their products can now be found in Portland, Oregon, Phoenix, Arizona, and Sellersville, Pennsylvania.
Products.
The production line at Jack and Jason's currently makes five distinct flavors of pancake mix with a majority of the ingredients supplied by regional Bay Area businesses. 
Health.
Jack & Jason's mixes are produced using organic ingredients provided by local Bay Area companies. The company avoids the use of additives and preservatives (processed baking powder, hydrogenated oils, shortening, etc.) found in more common pancake mixes. As a result, Jack and Jason's mixes are low in fat, high in protein, and provide a full daily serving of dietary fiber from whole grain.
Events.
Jack & Jason's Pancakes & Waffles seeks to be an active member of the San Francisco community. The company stages events such as their annual "Pancake Palooza" and various other promotions at different locations across the city in efforts to stay connected to neighborhood residents and create a positive "local" atmosphere. The company hosted a media breakfast gathering at the Westin St. Francis in April and will make an appearance at the upcoming Bay to Breakers run in May.
National Pancake Week.
Jack & Jason's participates in "National Pancake Week", an annual celebration of the breakfast fare. On March 1, 2011, owners Harper and Jervis were presented with a Certificate of Honor from San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee commending their company on the quality of their product, green packaging material, and community outreach through donations to local charities and arts education.
Earth Month campaign.
In cooperation with The Nature Conservancy, Jack & Jason's Pancakes & Waffles will plant one tree for each case of their mix sold during the month of April. The Earth Month campaign stems from a combination of April's Earth Day and Arbor Day. The company has put forth a goal of planting 200 trees, but will match a higher number should that projection be surpassed.
Wine Enthusiast's Toast of the Town.
Jack & Jason's Pancakes & Waffles was a participant in "Wine Enthusiast Magazine's" Toast of the Town. The Toast of the Town is a "walk-around" event featuring premier Bay Area food and wine companies that takes place in and around City Hall.
"Pancake Palooza".
On the evening before the 2010 Bay to Breakers race, Jack and Jason's held their first annual "Pancake Palooza", a community carb-loading event aimed at providing runners with an alternative source for complex carbohydrates to fuel their upcoming dash across the city. This year's "Pancake Palooza" will be held at the Harvey Milk Arts Center in Duboce Park on May 14—it is a family-friendly event with all proceeds from an open raffle going directly to the San Francisco Child Abuse Prevention Center.

Walter Doane &quot;Bo&quot; Randall, Jr.

Walter Doane "Bo" Randall also known as Bo Randall or WD Randall (1909 – December 25, 1989) was a knifemaker who founded Randall Made Knives in Orlando, Florida.
Early life.
Randall was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1909. His family moved to Orlando, Florida in 1916. As a youth Randall enjoyed hunting and fishing and went on to become a successful citrus rancher. He first became interested in making knives after he purchased in 1936 a William Scagel knife that was being used to scrape paint off of a boat without showing any signs of wear or damage.
Knifemaking.
Impressed with his Scagel knife, Randall located Scagel and asked him how to make knives. Over the years he visited Scagel and corresponded with him, becoming his "pupil" with regard to knifemaking. Randall forged his first knife out of a leaf spring from an automobile in his garage in Lake Ivanhoe, Florida with a handle of stag and made his first hunting knife. On his first hunting trip with that knife he sold it to a companion and made another, repeating the pattern of making knives and selling them to friends one at a time. 
In 1938 Randall opened a shop in Orlando, Florida. Although Randall's initial efforts were inspired by Scagel's designs and were predominantly "sporting knives" for hunters and fisherman, a visit by a soldier bound for WW2 changed that. Randall began production of the "All Purpose Fighting Knife" giving it the designation of "Number 1" in his catalog. Between 1942 and 1945, Randall Made Knives produced 4,000 of these knives for US Troops in the war, with approximately 1,058 subcontracted out to Northampton Cutlery Company in Springfield, Massachusetts to meet the demand. In the 1950s Randall would return to the pattern of the Bowie knife for several of his combat knife designs.
Randall designed the Model 17 Astro Model and built 7 of these knives for NASA. In addition to the knife that made 21 orbits around the earth, several of Randall's knives are displayed in the Smithsonian Institution and in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. One Model 8 "Trout and Bird Knife" was displayed in the Monino Airbase museum near Moscow as part of the equipment carried by U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960.
Legacy.
Randall died in 1989 in Orlando, Florida, at 80 years of age.
Randall was inducted into the "Blade" magazine Cutlery Hall of Fame at the 1983 Blade Show as an inauguree. In 1997, Randall was inducted into the American Bladesmith Society Hall of Fame. In 2001, Randall's knives were listed as "Best Sheath Knife" as part of "Forbes" "50 Best List".

ThunderCats (2011 TV series)

ThunderCats is an American/Japanese animated television series, produced by Ethan Spaulding and Michael Jelenic. A reboot of the original 1980s TV series of the same name (which ran from 1985 to 1989), "ThunderCats" was developed by Warner Bros. Animation and Studio 4°C, and combined elements of western animation, with Japanese anime. The series began with an hour-long premiere on Cartoon Network on July 29, 2011.
Following the destruction of their home, the kingdom of Thundera, the ThunderCats (a group of humanoid cats) are forced to roam the planet Third Earth, in order to find a way to defeat the evil sorcerer Mumm-Ra, who plans on taking over the universe. Story-wise the series attempts to take a much darker and more cinematic approach than the original show, featuring a lot more focus on characterization and more sophisticated themes.
Initially planned for 52 episodes, it was confirmed by "ThunderCats" art-director Dan Norton in early 2013 that the show had been canceled after only one season. Reruns of the show later aired on Adult Swim's Toonami block.
Plot.
On the planet known as Third Earth, the cats have lived and thrived for generations in the kingdom of Thundera. However, one night the kingdom is attacked by the Lizard army, led by the evil sorcerer Mumm-Ra. With them, the lizards bring technology, a concept unfamiliar to the cats. Because of this, Thundera is destroyed, but a small band of surviving Thunderians, led by the young heir to the throne, Lion-O (who wields the powerful Sword of Omens), flee the destroyed city, in order to seek out the Book of Omens, which is said to have the knowledge needed to defeat Mumm-Ra. Once they find it, the ThunderCats realize that in order for them to defeat Mumm-Ra, they must unite all the different species living on Third Earth. The ThunderCats also find out that they have to find three stones of power which, if found by Mumm-Ra, will give him power to become the most powerful being in the universe.
Development.
Despite being based on the original 1980s TV series, the 2011 version differs greatly from it, with many aspects of the original show's story and characters being different. When comparing the original series to the 2011 reboot, producer Michael Jelenic stated, that "the old show felt more like a Saturday morning animated series and this feels more like a movie". Jelenic also said, that their take "is definitely darker but we've put a lot more focus on the characters and the arc, and because of that, we might have a few more sophisticated themes going on in this". Michael Jelenic stated that before work even began on the series, the makers mapped out an entire beginning, middle and end for the show's storyline, which was then broken-up into 13-episode arcs. Some stories from the original show will also be seen in these arcs.
The animation for the series was done by Warner Bros. Animation and Studio 4°C. According to supervising director of Studio 4°C, Shinichi Matsumi, they were handed the basic concepts for the show by Warner Bros. and were assigned to adjust them into the Japanese anime design. Matsumi believed that they succeeded in pushing the style of anime in the show with a variety of visual elements, such as scene compositions, effects and colors, as well as the action scenes. Kevin Kliesch composed the music for "ThunderCats", for which he took inspiration from John Williams, James Horner and Jerry Goldsmith, among others. Despite being orchestral, Kliesch also incorporated elements of electronics into the series' music.
Reception.
"ThunderCats" premiered on July 29, 2011 and attained a rating of 0.8, with over 2.4 million viewers. The highest rated show for that night received a 1.1, which makes the "ThunderCats" 0.8 a successful showing. The premiere episode of "ThunderCats" received very positive reviews, with some calling it "amazing" and "epic".
One of the things the premiere was praised for was its anime-inspired visuals. "ComicBookMovies.com" called the animation "beautiful" and "very fluid in motion", while Jeff Hidek, of "Star News Online", described it as "sleekier(sic) edgier", than the animation of the 1980s show. Brian Lowry, of "Variety", also felt that the show had a "cool look". Many were also happy with the changes made to the story and characters. Kenneth Carter of "The Birmingham News" called the story "multi-faceted", and the characters layered and flawed. He also felt that the character's introductions seemed rushed, and that "we get a chance to get to know them a little before the action begins". Edward Adams of "Creative Loafing" described the show as "moody and character driven, highlighting the all-too-human flaws you'd expect from an action series like this", while IGN's Matt Fowler described the show's re-imagined world as "so original and strange, that even clichés tend to come across like revelations".
"ThunderCats" was also praised for the changes it made to its source material. Jeff Hidek felt that "ThunderCats" "successfully echoes the fun, wonder and all-around coolness of the original characters while ditching some of the dated trappings of '80s-syndication". Ken Tucker of "Entertainment Weekly" called the show "a rather canny rethinking of a series that probably didn't take a lot of thinking to conceive in the first place", while Edward Adams also said that "where in the original series the environment was bright and colorful, in the pilot episodes the 2011 series, the tones are much darker". Despite the changes the show made to the original TV series, many still recommended the 2011 series to fans of the original. Both Kenneth Carter and Edward Adams called the show "a pleasant surprise", with Carter adding that "if you have fond memories of "ThunderCats", then you’ll love what you see here". Matt Fowler felt similarly, saying that "if you have an affinity for the old series, then you'll find "ThunderCats" somewhat entertaining".
Despite the positive response, many aspects of the show were criticized. "ComicBookMovies.com" called some of the characterization "a little cliché at times", while Kenneth Carter felt that the show was still a bit cheesy. Brian Lowry felt the series was designed as a marketing ploy for a new "ThunderCats" toyline, and that the show "represents a throwback to the drearily toy-driven 1980s, a period that seems destined to keep returning as much out of pragmatism as nostalgia".
Cancellation.
Following the end of the show's first season, "ThunderCats" was not immediately renewed for a second, which led to speculations that the series would be canceled. During the 2012 San Diego Comic Con, Michael Jelenic and Jeff Prezenkowski announced that "ThunderCats" has been put on hiatus as they haven't gotten any word from Cartoon Network about the series' future yet. In March 2013, Dan Norton posted that further work on the series is unlikely in the near future. The first season "ThunderCats" episodes briefly aired in the new Toonami block on Adult Swim. It was confirmed by "ThunderCats" art-director Dan Norton in early 2013 that the show had been canceled after only one season.
Post-Cancellation Info.
In an interview with Dan Norton, Shannon Eric Denton, and Larry Kenney at Power-Con, they mentioned that if there was a season two, it would detail Mumm-Ra's hand in the creation of the Snarfs, Slithe's history with Lynx-O (which would also explain how Slithe and the Lizards sided with Mumm-Ra), Mumm-Ra tricking the ThunderKittens for them to bring the Sword of Omens so he could send them to El Dara, and Pumyra being transformed into a wicked insectoid monster on a mission to capture the ThunderCats. The name of the final stone was also revealed as the Soul Stone.

Manickam excels in the local game of ‘Cock Fight’ and has total mastery of the game and the bird. Manickam is actually fighting for Choman in his regular cockfights with the Gounder (Manoj K.Jayan).
The local beauty is Kannaki (Nandita Das), who has some magical powers and half the village is lusting after her. Choman and the Gounder had fallen out with Kannaki, but Kannaki likes Manickam. She likes him for his courage and macho image. Manickam has another admirer in Choman’s sister Kumudam (Geetu Mohandas).
Kannaki and Manickam become very close and he takes a decision to marry her. When Choman comes to know of this, he is furious. He wants Manickam to marry his sister and goes to the extent of announcing their wedding at a public function. Manickam meets Kumudam and explains to her that he has a sisterly affection to her and not of that of a lover. Kumudam is heart broken, but still maintains a level of loyalty in hope that, Manickam will realize her love. Choman is angered by all this and develops a hurt feeling towards his best friend.
Kannaki meanwhile, out of love, tries to get Manickam out of the local game and out of the clutches of Kumudam. A local fortune teller Kanakamma (Kalpana) keeps feeding ideas and false news into Kannaki's ears about Manickam. On her idea, Kannaki gives an untrained cock on the pretense that she had trained the cock to fight, to Manickam. Manickam takes the cock to fight, against Choman's cock. Manickam loses the fight and comes home to tell Kannaki has cheated him. There she tells him she did this to have Manickam all to herself and away from Choman and the Gounder.
Choman and Gounder pair up to defeat Manickam at a local festival. They know that Manickam will come to the cock fight to take part. As Choman and Gounder plan, kumudam comes to say that her brother is wrong in fighting against Manickam,to which the Gounder says if she wants Manickam, they have to separate Kannaki from him. And their separation is only possible if this fight takes place.
Later, Kanakamma comes to Manickam and says Kumudam wants to meet him in private. After he goes to speak to Kumudam, Kanakammagoes goes inside and tell Kannaki that Manickam is cheating on her, and as proof she can go outside and see Manickam and Kumudam speaking. Meanwhile at a distance Manickam is telling Kumudam that he still sees her as a sister, and nothing else. Kumudam says she still loves him, and they depart. Kannaki then approaches Kumudam and says, Kumudam shouldn't meet Manickam again. Kumudam lies to her that she cannot stop herself from seeing her child's father who is Manickam, and that they have met like this many times before. Kannaki is shocked and asks Kumudam what she should do, to which Kumudam says she should let Manickam go back to Kumudam.
Kannaki then sees a local snake seller, and gets the most poisonous snake from him. Later Manickam is seen gifting Kannaki with a wedding saree to wear for their wedding. he says they will marry right after the game, which he is sure he will win.
Kannaki dresses up as a bride, and wishes Manickam the best for the game.As soon as he leaves, she tells Ravunni to tell Manickam that she left from that place, and that Manickam should forget her and marry Kumudam. He also tells Ravunni that she will be in the nearby Sarpakaavu, waiting for Ravunni, and until he tells her that Manickam left to stay with Kumudam, she will not come out.
Manickam wins the game, seriously injuring Choman's cock, and a fight disrupts. the Gounder runs away, and at the end of the fight, Manickam and Choman become friends. Manickam returns home announcing his victory, but Ravunni's bad news is waiting for him. Manickam then enters the house with his cock, full of grief and shock on why Kannaki did this to him. he locks the house, and does the same cock fight with him and his cock. He lets the cock wound and scratch him, till the cock pecks at his main vein on the neck. he falls down dead. In the meanwhile Ravunni who watched and tried to stop this from outside the house, goes and calls Kannaki. Initially she does not come, but when Ravunni tells her what Manickam did to himself, she comes out and goes to see him. When she finds him dead, she lets out a deep wail and cry. She then takes out the snake she bought earlier, and lets the snake bite her. She also dies besides Manickam's body.

<doc id="31156672" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31156672" title="Supermoon">
Supermoon

A supermoon is the coincidence of a full moon or a new moon with the closest approach the Moon makes to the Earth on its elliptical orbit, resulting in the largest apparent size of the lunar disk as seen from Earth. The technical name is the perigee-syzygy of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. The term "supermoon" is not astronomical, but originated in modern astrology. The association of the Moon with both oceanic and crustal tides has led to claims that the supermoon phenomenon may be associated with increased risk of events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but the evidence of such a link is widely held to be unconvincing.
The most recent occurrence was on 30 January 2014. The next occurrence will be on 10 August 2014, which will be the closest encounter in 2014.
The opposite phenomenon, an apogee-syzygy, has been called a micromoon, though this term is not as widespread as supermoon.
Definition.
The Moon's distance varies each month between approximately and due to its elliptical orbit around the Earth (distances given are center-to-center).
According to NASA, a full moon at perigee is up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than one at its farthest point, or apogee.
Terminology.
The name "SuperMoon" was coined by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979, arbitrarily defined as:
Nolle also, wrongly, claimed that the moon causes "geophysical stress" during the time of a supermoon. Nolle never outlined why the 90% was chosen.
The term "supermoon" is not used within the astronomical community, which use the term perigee-syzygy or perigee full/new moon. Perigee is the point at which the Moon is closest in its orbit to the Earth, and syzygy is a full or new moon, when the Earth, the Moon and the Sun are aligned. Hence, a supermoon can be regarded as a combination of the two, although they do not perfectly coincide each time.
Frequency.
The full moon cycle is the period between alignments of the lunar perigee with the sun and the earth, which is about 13.9443 synodic months (about 411.8 days). Thus approximately every 14th full moon will be a supermoon. However, halfway through the cycle the full moon will be close to apogee, and the new moons immediately before and after can be supermoons. Thus there may be as many as three supermoons per full moon cycle.
Since 13.9443 differs from 14 by very close to , the supermoons themselves will vary with a period of about 18 full moon cycles (about 251 synodic months or 20.3 years). Thus for about a decade the largest supermoons will be full, and for the next decade the largest supermoons will be new.
Effect on tides.
The combined effect of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's oceans, the tide, is when the Moon is either new or full. At lunar perigee the tidal force is somewhat stronger, resulting in perigean spring tides. But even at its most powerful this force is still relatively weak causing tidal differences of inches at most.
As the tidal force follows an inverse-cube law, that force is 18% greater than average. However, because the actual amplitude of tides varies around the world, this may not translate into a direct effect.
It has been claimed that the supermoon of March 19, 2011 was responsible for the grounding of five ships in the Solent in the UK, but such claims are not supported by scientific evidence.
Natural disasters.
There has been speculation that natural disasters, such as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami are causally linked with the 1-2 week period surrounding a supermoon.. No evidence has been found of any correlation between supermoons with major earthquakes.

DDAIP

DDAIP is a pharmaceutical ingredient added to topical products to increase penetration through the skin. Chemically, DDAIP is an ester of "N","N"-dimethylalanine and dodecanol. DDAIP is typically formulated as its hydrochloride salt (DDAIP.HCl). This salt is a white crystalline solid with a melting range of 88-93 °C and is an amphiphilic molecule with a pKa of 4.87 that is soluble in water up to about 40% w/v. DDAIP is proprietary to NexMed USA, a subsidiary of Apricus Biosciences.
Mechanism of action.
DDAIP is a permeation enhancer that temporarily changes the permeation dynamics of the lipid bi-layer and opens up the tight junctions between skin cells so that active drug molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the skin into systemic circulation. It can also improve the solubility of compounds resulting in enhanced drug permeation.
Clinical use.
DDAIP.HCl is a functional non-active excipient currently used in the topical drug Vitaros, an alprostadil vasodilator cream used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is also used in MycoVa, a terbinafine antifungal nail lacquer for onychomycosis currently in Phase III clinical trials.
Safety.
Overall, about 5,000 patients have been exposed to this compound with no serious adverse events recorded. DDAIP.HCl is primarily metabolized by esterases on cell surfaces and plasma to "N","N"-dimethylalanine, which is further demethylated to alanine; and dodecanol which is oxidized to lauric acid, both naturally occurring compounds already present in the body.

Kenneth Goff

Kenneth Goff (c. 19151972) was a Christian Identity minister and anti-Communist crusader. He was the 1944 national chairman of Gerald L. K. Smith's Christian Youth for America.
Biography.
According to his biographical material, he was a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) from May 2, 1936, to October 9, 1939, when he testified before the Dies Committee. He claimed that while in the CPUSA he infiltrated youth organizations and worked for Communist front organizations, maintaining links with Communist leaders both in the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., in order to lay the groundwork for Communist revolution in the United States. He also claimed that his testimony before the Dies Committee led to the dismissal of 169 federal employees. He died at the age of 57 in Chicago in 1972 during a speaking tour.
Following his appearance before the Dies Committee, Goff made numerous speaking tours and was the author of 28 books, numerous tracts and several periodicals, including from 1962-1967 "The Pilgrim Torch". In his 1954 book, "Hitler and the Twentieth Century Hoax", which denied the Holocaust, Goff claimed that Hitler was a Communist agent and hinted he was Jewish and also that Hitler was still alive and would reappear to advance Communism. He also claimed that both hippies and desegregation were part of a Communist plot. He told the Dies Committee that the Communists were in favor of water fluoridation, because they intended to take over water treatment plants and threaten to poison the water supply with fluoride if Americans did not surrender.
Goff's main influence on Christian Identity came through his leadership of the Soldiers of the Cross Training Institute, located in Evergreen, Colorado, which trained Christian Identity ministers, including Dan Gayman of the Church of Israel and Thomas Robb, pastor of the Christian Revival Center and National Director of The Knights Party (KKK). The Institute provided courses on Christianity, politics, survivalism and other subjects.
In his 1970 book, "The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars and Damned Liars", Morris Kominsky claimed that Goff was the author of "Brain-Washing", a book that purported to be a condensation of a work by Lavrentiy Beria, the Soviet secret police chief.
Goff has also been attributed with creating the "strangled to death quote", which he falsely attributed to the CPUSA leader, Gus Hall. The purported quote was:
“I dream of the hour when the last congressman is strangled to death on the guts of the last preacher-and since the Christians seem to love to sing about the blood, why not give them a little of it? Slit the throats of their children draw them over the mourners’ bench and the pulpit and allow them to drown in their own blood, and then see whether they enjoy singing those hymns." The quote is evocative of Voltaire, who wrote in 1733, "I should like to see...the last king strangled with the guts of the last priest". The evangelist Jerry Falwell used the false quote as late as 1980.
In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police released a 1960 letter from Goff to the anti-Communist writer Pat Walsh, which claimed that Canadian socialist leader Tommy Douglas had been active in Communist circles in the 1930s. According to Goff, "Premier Douglas was a preacher in Chicago about the time I was a member of the Communist Party and he attended party rallies on the University campus presided over by Claude Lightfoot and Morris Childs".

Snehithan is a 2002 Malayalam film directed by Jose Thomas starring Kunchacko Boban, Krishna, Preetha Vijayakumar and Nandana. Unfortunately, it was the last film of N. F. Varghese. 
Plot.
The story begins in a register office where Malavika (Nandana) waits for her lover Anand(Krishna) to come and register their marriage. She is accompanied by photographer Joji (Kunchako Boban) to cover the function. But when Anand does not turn up Malavika is forced to go with Joji. Taking sympathy on her, Joji helps her to get a hotel room, which leads to more trouble for them. Cops arrest them during a raid in the hotel and Joji's girlfriend Anu (Preetha Vijayakumar) comes to know about this. To make things worse Joji lies to the police that Malavka is his wife and they are let free. Malavika's parents come to know about their daughter's secret marriage and take the couple home creating more twist in the tale. 
There is nothing remarkable in the film. Boban as Jijo is charming, while Krishna, Preethi Vijayakumar and the new girl Nandana are just ok. The highlight of the film are the songs written by Yusuf Ali Kechery set to tune by Mohan Sithara, though one of them is exact copy of A.R Rahman's 'Kannathil Muthamittal'. The film makes it clear that director Jose Thomas has to go a long way to become a successful movie.

Thandavam is a Malayalam action film released in 2002. Directed by Shaji Kailas, this film had a huge star cast including Mohanlal, Kiran Rathod, Nedumudi Venu, Captain Raju, Saikumar, Manoj K. Jayan and Jagadish. Though, Thandavam had one of the best initial pull in the history of Malayalam cinema, it failed to satisfy even the hardcore Mohanlal fans.
Plot.
The story centers on Kasinathan (Mohanlal), a pragmatic but playful businessman keen on general welfare of his men also running a resort and massage parlour as a side business. Kasinathan is the younger brother of Swaminathan (Nedumudi Venu), the heir to Valiyamangalam Malika and the head of erstwhile feudal Midhilapuri. Midhilapuri is an idyllic village prospered through judicious use of agriculture as the path to good life. Kasinathan is powerful in his own right and is tipped to succeed influential politician Menon (Janardhanan) in Kerala politics. Kasinathan has a secret admirer in the form of a mysterious girl (Kiran Rathod) who drops messages and love hints everyday. But Kasinathan has still better issues to worry about! The burning issue of providing drinking water supply to Udayankara colony is time and again sabotaged by Cherpunkal Shankar Das (Saikumar), a wily and unscrupulous politician of crassiest morals who is intent on teaching a lesson to the alleged loyalty of the people who continue to support righteous politicians. The reciprocal justice is carried out by Kasinathan who in a strategic move corners Shankar Das in a compromising position with a serial actress (Maya Viswanath)and blackmails him to release permission for water supply in the village. Shankar Das is forced to resign from the cabinet. Ensuing celebration is amply enjoyed in a rain dance song by Kasinathan with all and sundry of his devoted satellites including characters Murugan (Jagadish),Vellapulli Mathachan(Jagathy Sreekumar), Tomi (Vijayakumar), Basheer (Salim Kumar) Pushpakumaran (Maniyanpilla Raju) etc. Kasinathan's secret lover turns out to be Meenakshi the only sister of his good friend DYSP Rajeevan (Captain Raju)
The upcoming business man Dasappan Gounder (Manoj K. Jayan) and his henchmen smells an opportunity to market Cola drinks in Midhilapuri and approaches Swaminathan to start a mutually profitable business deal. Swaminathan in his idealist moral sense is staunchly against the endeavour. Disappointed Gounder joins force with Shankar Das and craftily plots death of Swaminathan in a planned operation. The disappearance of Swaminthan moderates Kasinathan to an extent. He decides to don the garb of saviour of Midhilapauri and returns to his Valiyamangalam Malika. In a chance encounter, Kasinathan learns of the cause of death of his elder brother as planned murder perpetrated by Gounder, DYSP and Shankar Das. This unleashes the beast within him and true to his name, Kasinathan trounces on the hapless Gounder and Shankar Das to a vegetative life death end in the climax. Dasappan Gounder is lured to a barn and is thrashed to senselessness by Kasinathan. Meanwhile, Shankar Das is on a self-imposed pilgrimage to gather strength for a showdown with Kasinathan. He is eventually caught in the middle of the Kayakalpa treatment at an ashram and goes mad in the end, a just retribution to a life full of sins and debauched deeds.
After sorting out the evil issues, Kasinathan is still troubled by the “gap” and decides to solve this issue once and for all by marrying his sweet heart.

Andrew E. Goldsbery

Andrew E. Goldsbery (September 25, 1840 – December 27, 1910) was a Union Army soldier during the American Civil War. He received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Siege of Vicksburg on May 22, 1863. His name is sometimes spelled as Goldsbury.
Goldsbery joined the 127th Illinois Infantry in August 1862, and was mustered out in June 1865.
Union assault.
On May 22, 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack.
The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a "forlorn hope". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.
The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed. Seventy-nine of the survivors were awarded the Medal of Honor.
Medal of Honor citation.
For gallantry in the charge of the volunteer storming party on 22 May 1863.

Kawasaki Vulcan 750

The VN750, also known as the Vulcan 750, is a 750 cc class cruiser-style motorcycle made by Kawasaki from 1985 to 2006. The Vulcan 750 was Kawasaki's first cruiser and first V-twin engine introduced in late 1984 as the 1985 model.
Production history.
Kawasaki introduced the 750 cc class Vulcan worldwide in 1985. Due to tariff restrictions in the United States on bikes over 700 cc imported from Japan, the initial US spec model was limited to 699 cc and called the Kawasaki Vulcan 700. The tariff was lifted in 1986, and all bikes from then until the production run ended in 2006 were 749 cc. The US name was changed to Vulcan 750 to reflect this.
Overview.
The VN750 remained largely unchanged throughout its 22 year production run with only minor adjustments to the components and varying paint schemes. The VN750 was unique in its class by featuring a more reliable shaft drive usually found on larger cruisers. The bike also featured a liquid cooled DOHC V-twin engine producing 60 horsepower and a flat 47 ft-lbs of torque throughout most of the rpm range, although the engine was underrated and commonly produced 8-10% more than the advertised power in dynomometer testing. The bike was configured to support an upright riding position with a king/queen seat and a factory installed sissy bar. The VN750 also featured adjustable air shocks front and rear, with Showa 4-way valving on the rear.

Treaty of Niš (1914)

The Treaty of Serbian–Albanian Alliance, also known as the Treaty of Niš, was a secret treaty signed in Niš between Essad Pasha Toptani and prime minister Nikola Pašić of Kingdom of Serbia on September 17, 1914.
Background.
On May 17, 1914 Essad Pasha Toptani was accused of assisting the Peasant Revolt against William of Wied. He was exiled to Italy on May 20, without trial. In Italy, he was received with honor since both Italian and Austrian representatives played roles in intrigues that surrounded the revolt. Only a week after prince Wilhelm of Wied's departure from Durres on September 3, 1914, another violent revolt arose. The rebels managed to lay siege on Durres, imprison Wied's supporters, to call for Muslim prince and to establish the Senate for Central Albania.
The Treaty.
In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha decided to accept the invitation of the Senate of Central Albania to return and lead them. First he travelled to Niš, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić signed the secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on September 17, 1914. The treaty was signed in Banovina building (which has been part of the University of Niš since 1966), which is close to Niš fortress.
The treaty had fifteen points which set up Serbian-Albanian political and military institutions and the military alliance of Albania and the Kingdom of Serbia. The treaty envisaged a rail-road to Durres, the financial and military support of the Kingdom of Serbia to Essad Pasha's position as Albanian ruler and it recorded the demarcation by a Serbo-Albanian commission. The treaty allowed Essad Pasha to change some clauses because the treaty would need the agreement of from the Albanian National Assembly. This would be possible after Pasha was elected ruler. Serbia contracted to supply a military intervention to protect Pasha's rule and to subsidise his gendarmerie by paying 50,000 dinars per month for Albanian military supplies.
Aftermath.
In October 1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dibër and captured the interior of Albania and Dures.

Raphael Abramovitch

Raphael Rein Abramovich (1880–1963) was a Russian socialist, a member of the General Jewish Workers' Union in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Bund) and a leader of the Menshevik wing of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (RSDRP).
Life.
Raphael Abramovich was born in Daugavpils in 1880; his real name was Raphael Rein, Abramovich being his patronymic name. As a student at Riga Polytechnic he became involved in revolutionary politics and became a convinced Marxist. In 1901 he joined the Bund and the RSDRP. When the Bund withdrew from the RSDRP in 1903, Abramovich maintained contact with Menshevik leaders Martov and Dan. The Bund and the Mensheviks eventually patched up their differences, and Abramovich became a member of the Menshevik party. He edited the Social-Democratic journals "Evreiskii Rabochii" ("Jewish Workers") and "Nashe Slovo" ("Our Word"). In 1905 Abramovich became a member of the Central Committee of the Bund. During the abortive Revolution of 1905, he represented the Bund in the St. Petersburg Soviet. In 1907 he ran unsuccessfully as a candidate for the second Duma. He attended the conferences of the Bund and the RSDRP in 1906 and 1907. In 1911 he narrowly escaped arrest and fled abroad, mostly living in Germany and France. 
In 1914 he at first sided with the Internationalist wing of the Menshevik party, which opposed the First World War, but he was not as radically anti-war as Martov. After the February Revolution of 1917, Abramovich returned to Russia. He became a member of the Central Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. For a while he became a qualified Revolutionary Defencist, siding with Mensheviks like Dan and Tsereteli against Martov. While Martov's Menshevik Internationalists opposed the war altogether, the Revolutionary Defencists supported a limited war effort in defence of the Revolution. However, they opposed territorial or financial war aims and rejected the unqualified pro-war stance of 'Social Patriots' like the aged Plekhanov and A.N. Potresov. After the October Revolution, Abramovich and Dan once more moved to the left and rejoined Martov's faction. Abramovich played a role in unsuccessful attempts to negotiate and all-socialist coalition with the Bolsheviks, comprising Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries of various factions and Popular Socialists. Neither Lenin nor most of the leaders of the other proposed coalition partners had any interest in this idea, though there was popular support for it among workers. The negotiations failed. Abramovich subsequently became more critical of the Bolsheviks. In 1918 he was arrested for anti-Soviet activities and escaped execution due to the intervention of Friedrich Adler and other foreign socialists. 
In 1920 Abramovich left Soviet Russia. He settled in Berlin, where he co-founded and co-edited the Menshevik paper "Sotsialisticheskii Vestnik" ("Socialist Courier"). In the 1920s he was involved in organising the Vienna-based International Working Union of Socialist Parties, which united non-communist socialist parties that rejected the 'Social Patriot' leadership of the old Second International but refused to join the communist Third International. He was later included in the executive of the Labour and Socialist International. Abramovich was also instrumental in maintaining contact between Mensheviks abroad and their comrades in Russia. He helped mobilise Western socialist and labour support for socialists persecuted by the Soviet government, e.g. during the Trial of the Socialist-Revolutionaries in 1922 and the Menshevik Trial in 1931. 
After the rise of Hitler, Abramovich moved to Paris. In 1940, when the Germans invaded France, he fled to the United States. He mainly lived in New York. He was a contributor to the Yiddish Social-Democratic paper "Forwerts" ("Forward"). Abramovich wrote his memoirs in Yiddish and an English-language history of the Russian Revolution. He remained heavily involved in the activities of the Menshevik party in exile. In later years he opposed F.I. Dan's position that Soviet Russia, for all its flaws, was the country 'building socialism' and must be supported, and denounced Soviet totalitarianism. In 1949 he was one of the founders of the Union for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia.
Raphael Abramovich was the father of the journalist Mark Rein, who was kidnapped in Spain by the Soviet secret service OGPU in 1937 and subsequently murdered.

One Day a Lemming Will Fly

One Day a Lemming Will Fly is the third episode of "Cracker", divided into two parts. It is the final episode of season one.
Plot.
Part One.
Fitz and Judith have reconciled and Judith and Katy have moved back in with Fitz and Mark. While Judith is trying her best to patch things up, Fitz finds it impossible to share a bed with her due to her affair with Graham (from "To Say I Love You"). Fitz drowns his sorrows in a casino and manages to win quite a bit of money, but is assaulted and mugged once outside by a man who proceeds to take the money back to the casino (implying he was hired by the casino to sabotage genuine winners).
A young boy called Timothy Lang is seen running frantically through a wood, followed by an unseen adult. Later on, a man and a woman struggle briefly in the same wood until they start kissing fiercely. Just as they are about to have sex, they notice Timothy hanging by the neck from a nearby tree. Terrified, they run away. Timothy's family, who have not heard from him for a few hours, call the police. After a press conference twelve hours later, the woman from the couple, Mrs Perry, calls the police anonymously (as she is married and was cheating on her husband) and leads them to Timothy's body. DCI Bilborough and DS Penhaligon break the news to Timothy's family.
Bilborough, himself under stress due to his wife's late pregnancy, angrily berates Mrs Perry for waiting so long to help a dead child and threatens to tell her husband about her affair if she does not tell them who her boyfriend was. She gives his name as Francis Bates, and Bilborough orders DS Beck and Penhaligon to pick both Bates and Fitz up (much to Beck's chagrin). Bates tells Bilborough and Beck that the night they saw Timothy, he had noticed somebody jogging nearby. Bilborough nevertheless screams at Bates for leaving Timothy hanging from the tree and calls him a "bloody animal" for acting against human nature.
Timothy's death is at first considered a suicide, but the pathologist's report reveals that Timothy was actually strangled to death and the hanging was staged to make it look like a suicide. This revelation causes almost everyone connected with Timothy to feel as if they are responsible. As Fitz interviews Timothy's parents, Timothy's father admits to Fitz that he would have preferred it to be suicide, as it would be a brave decision Timothy made himself, while Timothy's mother says that she prefers it to be murder, as Timothy would not commit suicide and therefore drop such a huge emotional bomb on his family. Timothy's elder brother, Andy, reacts to his feelings of guilt by attacking one of Timothy's classmates, Tom, who had bullied Timothy for years since Timothy was actually homosexual (and Andy himself had refused to help Timothy at the time). Both Andy and Tom are arrested, and Andy attempts to attack Tom again in the station. Andy is put inside a cell while Beck ferociously chastises Tom for his cheek to bully Timothy and his cowardice to confront Andy (Tom angered Beck by waiting until Andy was conveniently out of earshot to throw an insult at him).
Timothy's teacher, Nigel Cassidy, attempts to commit suicide out of guilt. First, he tries to poison himself by turning the gas taps on inside his flat. When this fails, he considers jumping off the roof of the Ramada Hotel. Fitz and Penhaligon arrive and Fitz tricks Cassidy into grabbing hold of him, thus pulling him away from the edge. Fitz and Penhaligon interrogate Cassidy while leading him through a shopping centre, and come to the conclusion that Cassidy might be Timothy's killer. Cassidy is arrested, but an angry mob of parents outside the police station prevents them from entering and they begin rocking the car in an attempt to reach and kill Cassidy.
Part Two.
Penhaligon calls for backup and several officers emerge to push the crowd away. Bilborough speaks severely to the largest two of the crowd and threatens to arrest them if they break the law again. Cassidy's girlfriend, Leslie, is brought in for questioning, as Cassidy claims he was with her the night Timothy died. Leslie backs this up, but Fitz, Penhaligon and Beck do not believe her. Beck tries to sway her over by suggesting Cassidy might be gay, but it only works after Penhaligon warns her of the consequences of being found out. Finally, she admits she was not with Cassidy. Cassidy, meanwhile, tells Fitz that he briefly jogged the night of the murder. Francis Bates is brought back to the station to identify the jogger. He notices and recognises Cassidy among the suspects, but only as the man who teaches his son at school, and tells Bilborough that Cassidy was not the jogger he saw. Though skeptical, Bilborough is forced to release Cassidy, who is escorted home by Fitz and Penhaligon. However, Cassidy is attacked at his home by Mr Lang and another father, Lindsay, who hijack a crane and use it to smash Cassidy's flat. Penhaligon calls for backup and Bilborough has them arrested. Bilborough recommends that Cassidy spend the night in a hotel with Fitz and Beck for protection. While alone in the car, Penhaligon shows her affection for Fitz when she asks him to come away with her on holiday for a week. Fitz accepts.
The mob outside the station returns when Bilborough brings in the two fathers and arrests Andy again for blocking his way. The Chief Super, noticing Bilborough acting more and more rashly, angrily orders him to stay in the canteen to calm down (although Bilborough instead finds solitude in the toilet).
At the hotel, Beck remains convinced that Cassidy is Timothy's killer and angrily berates him for his apparent homosexual paedophilia. Fitz counters Beck by suggesting that maybe Beck once thought he might be homosexual when there was a feminine-looking boy he fancied at school, and might even be the reason for his moustache, to prove he is not gay (as moustaches have apparently become a fashion for gay men). Beck furiously denies it, but nonetheless backs off. Fitz turns his attention to the troubled Cassidy, and attempts to crack him into confessing to the murder. Fitz surmises that Cassidy and Timothy were in the woods alone and Cassidy attempted to molest Timothy, who began crying, and out of fear of Timothy telling his mother and then the police, Cassidy strangled Timothy to death and strung him in the tree to make it look like Timothy committed suicide. After Fitz promises to share the burden of the murder of a child, Cassidy finally confesses to the murder, and is taken back to the station to be charged. Meanwhile, Bilborough's wife, Catriona, goes into labour. Penhaligon drives Bilborough to the hospital, where Catriona gives birth to a baby boy, much to Bilborough's relief.
The next morning, Fitz and the police prepare to celebrate solving Timothy's murder (including Beck, who has comically shaved off his moustache in response to what Fitz said). Fitz goes to visit Cassidy in his cell one last time before he is charged. Cassidy accuses Fitz of being a hypocrite obsessed with uncovering other people's lies yet remaining a liar himself, although Fitz counters that it is nothing compared to murder. Then, Cassidy drops the final bombshell: he did "not" kill Timothy.
Although he is not gay, he fancied Timothy because of his femenine appearance. Timothy knew this, and also fancied Cassidy. Timothy visited Cassidy one night and revealed that he was in love with him, but Cassidy, terrified of the consequences of a possible affair, chased Timothy away, and it was the same night Timothy was murdered. Thus, Cassidy was consumed by guilt and he felt responsible for Timothy's death, as had he not frightened him, Timothy might have still been alive. Fitz implores Cassidy to retract his confession so that they can continue the investigation and find the real killer, but Cassidy callously reminds Fitz of his promise to share his burden: if Cassidy is convicted, the killer will be able to strike again and Fitz will have allowed this to happen.
Fitz tells Bilborough of this and implores him to release Cassidy, but he refuses, more concerned with the consequences of having to tell the Chief Super, Timothy's family and the mob outside that he made such a huge mistake. Startled at Bilborough's dishonesty, Fitz walks out, vowing never to work with Bilborough again. Bilborough holds a press conference and announces publicly that they are charging Cassidy with Timothy's murder, apparently with no shred of hesitation or remorse. Beck, on the other hand, appears visibly uncomfortable, but is ordered to remain silent.
As Fitz prepares for his holiday with Penhaligon, he looks out of his window and sees Judith, Mark and Katy together in the garden. Unwilling to lose his family again, he stands Penhaligon up at the airport, and does not answer the phone when Penhaligon phones to tell him he has forgotten their holiday, symbollically severing his ties with the police. With a clear conscience, Fitz joins his family in the garden.

Leonidas Mahlon Godley (June 13, 1836 – May 23, 1904) was a Union Army soldier during the American Civil War. He received the Medal of Honor for gallantry during the Siege of Vicksburg on May 22, 1863.
Union assault.
On May 22, 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack.
The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a "forlorn hope". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.
The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed. Seventy-nine of the survivors were awarded the Medal of Honor.
Medal of Honor citation.
The President of the United States of America, in the name of Congress, takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to First Sergeant Leonidas Mahlon Godley, United States Army, for extraordinary heroism on 22 May 1863, while serving with Company E, 22d Iowa Infantry, in action at Vicksburg, Mississippi. First Sergeant Godley led his company in the assault on the enemy's works and gained the parapet, there receiving three very severe wounds. He lay all day in the sun, was taken prisoner, and had his leg amputated without anesthetics.

Channel 4's Comedy Gala (2010)

"Channel 4's Comedy Gala" of 2010 was a British comedy benefit show organised by Channel 4. It was the inaugural Channel 4 Comedy Gala, an annual charity event held O2 Arena in London in aid of Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital. Filmed live on 30 March 2010, a two and a half-hour highlights show was broadcast on Channel 4 on 5 April 2010. Billed by Channel 4 as "the biggest live stand up show in UK history" it featured seventeen comedians performing stand-up, as well as a number of others performing live and pre-recorded sketches, to an audience of 16,000. It raised nearly £1 million to open a new anaesthetic room.
Beneficiary.
All profits from ticket and DVD sales of the Comedy Gala were to go to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children's Charity. All performers waived their fees for the show. The money was to be used towards the provision of two new anaesthetic rooms, allowing parents to remain with their children up until the time they enter the operating theatres.
Katie Price made an appearance at the gala, mentioning that her disabled son Harvey is a regular visitor to the hospital. At the end of the performance, Jack Dee presented Lee Evans with a Channel 4 lifetime achievement award, which he auctioned on the spot for £5,000 for the charity, selling it to a member of the audience. Evans told the audience of his personal connection to the hospital, through the loss of his brother's eight-year old son. Jack Dee's son was also once a patient at the hospital.
The 2010 gala ultimately raised nearly £1 million, enough to open a new anaesthetic room.
History.
The Comedy Gala was commissioned by Channel 4 Entertainment commissioning editor, Syeda Irtizaali. Promoted by Off the Kerb Productions, it was to be filmed by Open Mike Productions.
14,000 tickets went on sale on 12 February 2010 for the live show at the O2 Arena, scheduled for 30 March 2010. 2,000 more tickets were released on 26 February. With over 25 performers taking part, Channel 4 promoted the show as "the biggest live stand up show in United Kingdom history", and "the comedy event of the year". All tickets for the show were sold in advance according to promoters Off the Kerb.
The live show was to be opened by Alan Carr, and would feature live stand-up from several comedians, with other artists contributing additional sketches and filmed inserts, in addition to celebrity appearances from the likes of Katie Price and Alex Reid, and Christine Bleakley, as well as musicals performances by Stomp and Bill Bailey. Channel 4 was to screen 2 hours of highlights from the show at 9pm on bank holiday Easter Monday, 5 April 2010. It was announced on 1 April that the Channel 4 broadcast would also feature a special advert break, with Jimmy Carr mocking a selection of willing advertisers.
The live-show went ahead, finishing at 11pm. The Channel 4 programme aired on 5 April, running for an extra 30 minutes over the advertised length. There was a hint at the second gala to come, when Jack Dee closed the first show stating "we'll see you next year, thank you and goodnight". A second gala was duly announced on 10 March 2011.

Hosts and special guests.
All the stand-up acts were given 4–5 minutes to perform, with longer performances from Michael McIntyre and Lee Evans. To gel the stand-up acts and sketches together, the show used several hosts presenting in turn, which split the show into different notional sections; as well as using special guests and in-character acts for other one-off introductions for other acts. Alan Carr and Jack Dee acted as both hosts and stand-up performers, while some other hosts had short 1 minute acts too.
Alan Carr was the first host, introducing Jason Manford, Jo Brand, the apology sketches and Sean Lock, before appearing in the short film about the hospital. Jonathan Ross then took over as host, introducing the message from Johnny Depp, then the acts by Kevin Bridges, the special ad-break, Patrick Kielty, and the special sketch by "The Ricky Gervais Show". Rob Brydon and Gok Wan then introduced the first "Kevin Bishop Show" sketch and Andy Parsons, while Brydon then went on to do a short Tom Jones impression before then introducing Mark Watson. Michael McIntyre was introduced by the celebrity couple Katie Price and Alex Reid, while Fonejacker, appearing in character as 'Terry Tibbs' and accompanied by celebrity guest and BBC presenter Christine Bleakley, then introduced Jack Dee's act. Following his own act, Dee went on to introduce Shappi Khorsandi and the "Peep Show" sketch. Catherine Tate then appeared in character as 'nan' Joannie Taylor from "The Catherine Tate Show", to introduce Noel Fielding. The "Gavin & Stacy" sketch was not announced, while its characters Corden and Jones then introduced John Bishop. David Mitchell then took over as host, introducing Jack Whitehall, Rich Hall and the second "Kevin Bishop Show" sketch.
The hosts themselves were introduced by the voice of Peter Dickson, with the exception of David Mitchell who was introduced by the previous act, John Bishop. Dickson also introduced Bill Bailey and Lee Evans as the only other acts not introduced in person by somebody. For comedic effect, the start of the "Gavin & Stacey" sketch was not announced at all.
Other live acts.
The show opened with a performance by the musical troupe Stomp who make music using plastic and metal bins and barrels, and oil drums. Alan Carr was then revealed to have been in one of their wheelie bins for the entire performance. Tipped out of the bin, he begins the stand-up show with his own act, before acting as host for the first segment.
Bill Bailey performed a short stand-up before going on to perform various musical comedy shorts on the keyboard, with additional vocals by Kevin Eldon.
James Corden and Ruth Jones appeared in character as Smithy and Nessa from their television sit-com "Gavin & Stacey", carrying forward the plot from the final episode by pretending to be visiting London on a day trip from Barry Island. Lost and late, they appear on stage looking for their seats, before realising they're on stage and carrying on in character.
In 'The Lee Evans Trio', Lee Evans appears on his own, spotlighted in turn, miming playing three different instruments, drums, double bass and piano.
Pre-recorded sketches.
Various performers provided special shorts of their television shows for the Gala. A special message from the animated show "The Ricky Gervais Show" featured the voices of Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant & Karl Pilkington in a sketch about giving to charity and swimming with dolphins. In the first "The Kevin Bishop Show" sketch, Bishop appears as 'Rok Wan' alongside Gok Wan as Gok's younger brother, for a make-over. In his second sketch, in a notional More4 programme 'Celebrity Siblings Reunited', Bishop appears as 'Darren Brown', meeting his twin brother Derren Brown on their birthday. In the "Peep Show" sketch, David Mitchell and Robert Webb perform a sketch in a restaurant about donating to charity.
Actors Sir Patrick Stewart and Johnny Depp, singer Rihanna, actor Kyle MacLachlan, celebrity Sharon Osbourne, all appeared during the show to give notional pre-recorded messages of apology for not being able to attend. However, these were all in fact comedy spoofs. Johnny Depp and Rihanna joked that Jonathan Ross was the reason they weren't appearing, Osbourne play-acted that she had been snubbed by Channel 4, while Stewart and MacLachlan sent-up the general idea of celebrities being less than committed to making appearances at charity galas.
Pitched by Carr as the 'serious bit' in the mould of Comic Relief type information films inserted between the comedy acts, the short film broadcast early in the show about the Great Ormond Street Hospital featured instead, Alan Carr touring the hospital meeting staff and patients, making various comic gaffes.
During the special ad-break featuring Jimmy Carr, Carr appeared either in specially filmed inserts, or in walkover shots, mocking adverts for Gocompare.com, Churchill car insurance, Specsavers, PokerStars.com, Kerry Low Low cheese and Guinness
Reception.
The live show was greeted with average to good reviews, with "The Daily Telegraph" and the London "Evening Standard" giving it 4 out of 5 stars, while "The Times" and "The Independent" gave it 3 stars. The length of the show and size of the arena were pointed out as detracting points. Michael McIntyre and Lee Evans were universally recognised as being the best acts of the show. Other noted acts were Jack Dee, John Bishop, Rich Hall, Noel Fielding, and a musical routine by Bill Bailey and Kevin Eldon. With McIntyre being closer of the first half, and Evans closing the show, they had both been given longer than the 5 minutes given to most acts, leading to observations that this meant the intervening acts had neither the time to die a death, or heat up the performance beyond being just enjoyable. The inclusion of Katie Price and Alex Reid was questioned; they were roundly booed by the audience. Media outlets picked up on Patrick Kielty and Sean Lock's inclusion of gags about Michael Jackson, who had been planning to stage his farewell concerts at the arena before his shock death nine months previously. The appearance of James Corden and Ruth Jones in character from popular sit-com "Gavin and Stacey" also generated media interest.
The Channel 4 broadcast on 5 April was to be the highlight of the Channel 4 Easter programming, going up against the Guardian's other Easter Monday TV highlight selections of the final ever episode of "A Touch of Frost" on ITV, and the UK premiere of the long-awaited series "The Pacific", on Sky Movies.

Menstad conflict

The Menstad conflict () was a Norwegian policing and political débâcle on 8 June 1931 at Norsk Hydro's Menstad plant, near Skien in the Norwegian province of Telemark.
Since March, Norway had been feeling significant industrial tension as the full effects of the Great Depression began to be felt in Norway. It was in this atmosphere that the Norwegian Employers' Confederation (NAF) announced a pay cut of 15 and 20 percent. When the Workers' National Trade Union rejected this suggest and counter-proposed a reduction of working hours, the NAF responded with a programme of lockouts. During the lockouts, two companies, Norsk Hydro and Norske Skog Union, chose to allow some contract workers to perform some work. This was perceived as strikebreaking and led to an escalation of the conflict level.
It was an angry mood in which Secretary of Labor (and later Prime Minister) Einar Gerhardsen called strikebreakers "skabbdyr" (scabs) and director of Norsk Hydro Bjarne Eriksen described the dispute as being one between Labour and the community. In the afternoon of 8 June 2,000 workers marched to the Norsk Hydro trans-shipment port and warehouse at Menstad, where 100 police officers guarded the contract workers.
The brief "battle", between police and strikers, saw law-and-order forces overwhelmed by demonstrators, who threw stones and iron piping before the protesters retreated. The government response (passed on by Minister of Defence, Vidkun Quisling) was to send the army into the province with the stated aim of protecting nearby weapons depots. Although there was no further incident and law and order in the area was duly restored, the government response was heavily criticised by the Communist party, who had led the original demonstrations.

Harry Vassall

Henry Vassall (22 October 1860 – 5 January 1926) was an English rugby union player, best known as a centre for Oxford University. Vassall played international rugby for England in the early years of the sport, winning five caps and scoring a hat-trick of tries in the first encounter between England and Wales.
While at Oxford University Vassall led the university rugby side to 70 matches without defeat during his three-year captaincy. His belief that the forward players should work in unison with their backs was revolutionary to the game of rugby and changed the way that rugby was played at club and country level. He is recognised as one of the most important figures in the early development of the sport.
Early life.
Vassall was born in Barwick in Elmet, a township in the Tadcaster district, in 1860, the son of William Vassall and his wife Martha Ann. His father was a rector originally from Great Wigston in Leicestershire, his mother a native of Leeds, who was fifteen years her husband's junior. Just after Harry (named Henry) was born, his family, including his two older siblings William and Margaret, moved to Hardington Mandeville in Somerset where his father took up the post of rector of the parish. Henry's mother had been just nineteen when his eldest brother William was born in 1858, and Margaret and Henry had followed in successive years. After moving to Hardington, Henry's family continued to grow at a prodigious rate and between 1861 and 1882 Henry gained a further twelve siblings, the last of which was Leonard born in 1882 when Martha was forty-two. This was the year before Henry's father's death in 1883. Henry was educated at Marlborough College before matriculating to Hertford College, Oxford in 1879.
Rugby career.
Vassall had played rugby during his college days at Marlborough, a school only second to Rugby in its impact on the emergence of rugby. He continued playing at Oxford, and he was part of the Oxford University team in the 1879 Varsity Match, gaining his first sporting 'Blue'. Vassall played in the 1880 Varsity Match and the same season was made the team's honorary secretary. As secretary he brought to the University team a level of organisation that had previously not existed. He ensured the college games were properly organised and set up trials to ensure the best players were chosen.
In the 1881 season a match was arranged between England and Wales, the very first international match for the Welsh. A space was left in the England team in the pack for an Oxford University player, which was given to Vassall. Wales were completely unprepared, and the team was constructed to appease regional sides, the result was an 8–0 defeat (82–0 by modern standards). Vassall had an excellent game, scoring a hat-trick of tries, the first individual to ever achieve this feat in an international rugby game. His reign as the highest try scorer in a single international game was short lived, as during the same encounter George Burton surpassed him minutes later by scoring four.

Johns joined the 113th Illinois Infantry in August 1862, and was mustered out in June 1865.
Union assault.
On May 22, 1863, General Ulysses S. Grant ordered an assault on the Confederate heights at Vicksburg, Mississippi. The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack. The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a "forlorn hope". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.
The Union soldiers came under enemy fire immediately and were pinned down in the ditch they were to cross. Despite repeated attacks by the main Union body, the men of the forlorn hope were unable to retreat until nightfall. Of the 150 men in the storming party, nearly half were killed. Seventy-nine of the survivors were awarded the Medal of Honor.

St. James' Church, Kolkata

St. James' Church in Kolkata (Calcutta), India, is one of Kolkata's most elegant churches. Built in 1862. the twin spires of the St. James' Church dominates Kolkata's skyline. It is popularly known as Jora Girja (Bengali:জোড়া গির্জা), literally meaning twin church for its twin spires.
History.
The present church was built to replace an older one of the same name which was situated in Nebutolla Lane, near Amherst Street. This earlier church, built very much after the style and plan of St. Thomas’ Church, Free School Street, was consecrated by Bishop Reginald Heber on 12 November 1829. It appears to have fallen into a state of disrepair, due chiefly to white ants having eaten into the beams, and was declared unsafe for divine worship. An attempt was made to repair the building, but while the work was in progress, the roof fell in during the early hours of the morning of 23 August 1858, leaving the church in ruins. It was decided to abandon any further attempts to repair the Church as it was found to be very much out of the way, and in many ways inconvenient for those attending it. The church authorities, therefore, resolved to build a new church in a more convenient locality and, in conjunction with it, a school for the children of the neighbourhood.
Architecture.
The project for building the new church and school had the full support and backing of Archdeacon Pratt, a keen educationist, who, with his influence, was able to acquire the garden house of Mr. Coates together with its spacious grounds for the purpose. At the same time, a smaller house in the grounds was also acquired for the residence of the Chaplain. This property was situated opposite the Female European Orphan Asylum, across the road, which had been founded during July 1815 by Mrs. Thompson, the wife of the Rev. T Thompson.
The foundation stone of the new Church was laid on 7 June 1862, by the Honorable John Peter Grant, acting Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, at the south-east corner of the foundations. A marble tablet placed on the eastern wall of the south transept reads –
<poem>The first stone of this Church dedicated to
St. James, was laid June 7th, 1862.
Consecrated by Bishop Cotton 25th July, 1864.

Marc David Lewis

Marc David Lewis, PhD (born 1951) is a developmental neuroscientist known for dynamic systems approaches to understanding the development of emotions and personality. He is currently a professor at the Radboud University in Nijmegen in the Netherlands.
Career.
Marc Lewis received his Ph.D. at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto in 1989. He was supervised by Robbie Case and can trace his academic lineage back to Jean Piaget through Case's mentor Juan Pascual Leone. From this neo-Piagetian origin, Marc Lewis began investigating cognition-emotion interactions: the influence of cognitive development on emotional and personality development, and the influence of emotion on cognitive and personality development, as a professor at the University of Toronto. This early theory and research led Lewis to incorporate the dynamic systems approaches to development that were emerging in the early 1990s. Following the work of Esther Thelen, Paul van Geert, Alan Fogel, and others, Lewis developed an integrated account of development as self-organization at multiple time scales to explain both the stability and change of emotional aspects of personality.
Through a sabbatical at the University of Oregon in 2000-2001, Lewis took the next step in developing his integrated model by delving into the neural underpinnings of emotion regulation. His current research program tests this model by examining brain and behavior in normal and clinically referred children and assessing neural changes corresponding with successful treatment. His papers on the contribution of dynamic systems theory and affective neuroscience to understanding human development and clinical syndromes have appeared in journals such as "Child Development", "Behavioral and Brain Sciences", "Development and Psychopathology", and "Perspectives on Psychological Science". He has also co-authored two books with his wife, Dr. Isabela Granic. The first is an edited volume of dynamic systems approaches to emotional development. The second is a guide for parents about when to attempt sleep training with toddlers. 
Dr. Lewis' most recent book, "Memoirs of an Addicted Brain", is an account of his addiction to drugs as a young man with accompanying explanations of the neurobiological processes underlying various drug experiences as well as the process of addiction itself.
Theoretical Model of Emotional Development.
Lewis' theory of emotional development relates multiple time scales using characteristics of self-organizing dynamic systems as causal mechanisms. This theoretical model relates the moment-to-moment emotional experiences in real time to the moods that persist for longer stretches at a middle or meso-time scale. These events consolidate through the strengthening or pruning of brain connections to become the habits and tendencies of personality at a developmental time scale of years. A further extension of this model incorporated the evolutionary time scale in an attempt to resolve the dispute about whether basic emotions are "natural kinds".

With Love... from the Age of Reason () is a 2010 French romantic comedy film written and directed by Yann Samuell and starring Sophie Marceau, Marton Csokas, and Michel Duchaussoy. The film is about a beautiful and successful forty-year-old businesswoman who receives a letter that she wrote to herself when she was seven years old to remind her of the promises she made at that age, which is considered to be the age of reason in the Catholic tradition, and to remind her of what she wants to become.
Plot.
Margaret is a beautiful and successful businesswoman selling power plants to the Chinese. With an adoring English lover, she appears to have everything going for her. On her fortieth birthday, Margaret receives the first bundle of letters she wrote to herself when she was seven years old. A jumble of colorful collages, photographs, and wildly creative puzzles seem to have come from a different girl entirely. In a letter the seven-year-old Margaret writes, "Dear me. Today I am seven years old and I'm writing you this letter to help you remember the promises I made when I was 7, and also to remind you of what I want to become..." As her letters to herself keep arriving, Margaret finds herself becoming disenchanted. The letters evoke long-forgotten memories and cast doubt on many of the choices she made in her life. In many ways she's become the opposite of what she hoped to become as a child. Margaret visits her childhood village and, by reconnecting with people who see in her the girl they once knew, she starts finding her way to the woman she vowed to become.

Karel Meulemans

Karel Meulemans (b. Retie, Belgium, 3 February 1934) is a Belgian pigeon fancier.
Biography.
Early life.
In 1946 moved Karel's parents, who were farmers, a farm on 3.5 hectares of land in Arendonk, (Belgium), where Karel Meulemans, to this day lives.
His first steps in the sport at age 12, he under the impetus his uncle Jan Bols. He was initially successful, with the exception of some nice results were obtained with pigeons by Adriaan Wouters. In 1961, Karel finally visited with his father, the lofts of Jos van den Bosch in Berlaar (Belgium) where 5 pigeons were purchased. These birds would provide the basis for the breed Meulemans, together with a hen of Adriaan Wouters in 1969 was introduced in the formation of the duo-Wouters Meulemans.
Wouters-Meulemans.
The main couple "Oude van den Bosch x Blue Janssen" was a host of top pigeons bred like Merckx, Junior, Kadet, Piet, Witneus, Schoon Donker, Liebling, Prins, Madelon and Benjamin. These pigeons were not only on the basis of the success of the Meulemans pigeons themselves, but also performed excellently in the lofts of many other seekers like Gommaire Verbruggen, Raymund Hermes, Willy Van Berendonck, William Geerts, Frans Moris, Stan Van Beemen, Horst Hackemer, Saville Penkin, Albert Babington,Timbarra Lofts UK, etc. Numerous victories and have won national and international Olympiad pigeons to breed Meulemans achieved. The peak years reached the Wouters-Meulemans team in 1973 and 1974 when prizes were 32 1st and won 180 prizes in the top 10. In 1975, however, came with the death of Adriaan Wouters an end to the cooperation. The Wouters-Meulemans pigeons collection semi-total sold.
Meulemans-Mariën.
In 1976 however a new team formed between Karel and Adrian Wouter's son, Frans Mariën. Again took Karels, who had his hands full on his farm for the breeding of pigeons, while Frans was the playing member of the team. Between 1976 and 1980 earned the Marien-Meulemans successes as a team with that of the former Wouters-Meulemans team at least equaled. The dominance of Frans Marien and Karel Meulemans was such that in the Zuiderkempen in 1978 were excluded in the middle distance races. Besides the descendants of the so-called Golden Couple "Oude Van den Bosch x Blue Janssen" also brought the descendants of a new super breeding pair "Blue Saelen x Oude Bourgeske" excellent results. Frans Marien's method of play hard, sometimes up to 2/3 of the race pigeons lost during the season, made it to growing resentment among "breeder" Karel Meulemans. He was, however, do not have the time to end the cooperation. In April 1980 Frans Marien committed suicide for reasons still unclear. By a clause in the cooperation contract, all the racing and breeding pigeons want to be sold with 20 pigeons in a way, where Karles had to pay as much for the 20 pigeons he kept than their encores in the auction had raised. For his precious collection of breeding pigeons in part to save Karel Meulemans was thus a financial drain to undergo, which gave him for an aversion to playing in team with other fans.
Meulemans-Damen.
From 1981 Karel was therefore had to collaborate with his daughter and son in law. Despite the fact that the new Meulemans-Dame duo could offer a nice loft breeders took until 1984 before a first prize Étampes of the comeback Meulemans pigeons announced. That same year they became Champion Middle Distance Yearlings in Arendonk. The success was short lived. In 1985, 21 racing pigeons stolen from the loft, including 2 of the 4 pigeons that had helped win the championship. The heaviest blow cashed the loft Meulemans But the following year, when thieves, despite an alarm system, to get started with 29 top pigeons, including the legendary "Kadet". Between 1986 and 1989, Karel Meulemans not be anything other than breeding and again trying to build loft. He then right away took the opportunity to switch on long distance. These distances were actually always formed Karel's passion, but his former teammates Adriaan Wouters Frans Marien and never had to know something of the game at long distances.
the 90's.
The Meulemans pigeons from the old line were now supplemented with pigeons from Karel Schellekens, Marien Pieterse, Georges Bolle and Van Gils. This "new" places Karel Meulemans pigeons early 90s back on the map with victories including Bourges, Montargis, Melun, Argenton and Limoges. A pigeon exchanges Leo Broeckx also showed a bull's eye. The Broeckx pigeons Karel had was the father of his pigeon Olympiad in Bazel in 1997. Broeckx 'pigeon was in turn to Karels's father loft "Jonge Kadet", 1st Limoges, Brive 1st and 2nd Chateauroux. Pigeons "Kadetje 2" (1st Bourges, 1st Argenton and 7th National Argenton) and "Den Brave" (first Narbonne, 1st Montauban and 1st Chateauroux) were the new superstars of the loft Meulemans. In 1995 put "Donkere Dax" the icing on the cake with a National win in Dax. Beautiful results from Brive and Cahors provided "Donkere Dax" the 8th National Ace Long Distance title. In 1996 a new golden trio born that Karel would be reminiscent of the happy years with Merckx, Junior and Kadet. "Pantani", "590" and "591" triumphed as the top long distance at Brive and Marseille. Their spectacular results gave Karel the highlight of his career. In 1999 he won the National Long Distance Championship. Karel Meulemans, the "Master Breeder" had finally proved that he is thus a "master player".
from 1999.
Such a result is of course even repeating for a great champion is not easy. Since 1999, however, express the Meulemans pigeons regularly made their mark on the distance events. New victories in Marseille, Cahors, Montauban, Bordeaux, Béziers, etc. confirmed the continuing value of the Meulemans pigeons for the sport. Meanwhile, the race to evolve, driven by Karel. New hybrids, including the Florizoone pigeons, the future without securing the value of the "Oude van den Bosch x Blue Janssen" strain from losing sight.

Bodrifty

Bodrifty is the modern name of an Iron Age village, now in ruins, in Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is 700 yards west of Mulfra Hill in Penwith District, 3 miles northwest of Penzance and 1.5 miles southwest of Porthmeor, on the high ground of the watershed between the Atlantic and the English Channel. Today the settlement is barely more than a farm within the boundary of the village of New Mill, just north of Boskednan.
History.
Professor Tim Darvill dates Bodrifty as far back as the seventh century BC, but James Dyer has claimed that Bodrifty began as an open settlement in the fourth century BC.
During the Iron Age, Bodrifty was inhabited by peasants who lived in round huts and cultivated small fields in the area. The settlement thrived between the fifth and second centuries BC, and Pytheas, the Greek geographer and explorer, is said to have visited Bodrifty on his travels in the 320s BC.
Archaeology.
The site is archaeologically significant in part because of the wide range of pottery shards discovered there. It was excavated extensively in the early 1950s and most of the finds are in the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro. An analysis of the styles of pottery suggests that Bodrifty was inhabited from the fifth century BC to the first or second century AD. The settlement consisted of eight structures surrounded by a stone wall enclosing about three acres. The structures themselves had internal diameters of between three and eight metres. It is possible that the name means "the house by the summer shed" in Cornish.
Replica roundhouse.
In 1999 Fred Mustill, a local smallholder, built a reconstruction of a roundhouse at Bodrifty Farm after receiving a small grant. The task of building the replica required the shifting of granite rocks weighing several tons, felling, shaping and lashing hundreds of feet of timber, and hundreds of hours' work cutting reeds for the roof. Mustill had previously researched typical roundhouse architectural structure and surveyed other reconstructions in Cornwall. Traditional rab (granite sub soil) was used for the mortar and woods such as oak, ash, holly and hazel for the roof. Mustill was keen for the house to be showcased as an educational aid for local children and others interested in history and archaeology, and hoped it would become a registered charity, though as of August 2011 it was being used for "luxury camping".

Susina Plantation

Susina Plantation is an antebellum Greek Revival house and several dependencies on 140 acres (57 ha) near Beachton, Georgia, approximately 15 miles (24 km) southwest of the city of Thomasville, Georgia. It was originally called Cedar Grove. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is currently a private residence.
History.
Antebellum.
Edward Blackshear moved to the area circa 1822 from what was then Pulaski County, Georgia. Edward was the brother of General David Blackshear, the namesake of Lake Blackshear and the town of Blackshear, Georgia. Edward died September 3, 1829 and his land passed to his wife and five children. The largest block was bequeathed jointly to his sons James Joseph and Thomas Edward. These two continued to acquire land and ultimately amassed approximately .
Circa 1841, James Joseph commissioned the architect John Wind to design a plantation house. This photograph, although probably taken after the American Civil War, depicts the structure as originally built. John Wind was born in Bristol, England, in 1819. He was also the architect for the Greenwood, Fair Oaks, Oak Lawn, Pebble Hill and Eudora Plantations, and the Thomas County Courthouse. William Warren Rogers writes "Some of Wind's work still exists and reveals him as one of the South's most taleted but, unfortunately, least known architects."
James Joseph Blackshear was killed in a cotton press accident on November 3, 1843 before the house was completed. His wife, Harriet Blackshear, completed the house and continued to acquire land. His will was not probated until 1857 and her new acquisitions were recorded in his name. Harriet became a prominent planter in her own right. In 1860, thirteen Thomas County planters produced over 100 bales of cotton. Harriet Blackshear had the record with 235 bales. She was also one of the county's larger rice producers and she raised 5000 bushels of sweet potatoes. Food crops were also required to feed not only her family, but the slaves who worked the land. The 1840 census recorded 43 male and 59 female slaves. When James Joseph's will was probated in 1857, it listed 161 slaves by name. Harriet Blackshear died in 1863. After the American Civil War, Cedar Grove fell onto hard times, but it remained in Blackshear hands until 1887.
Postbellum.
In the 1880s and 1890s, Thomasville was a popular wintering area for wealthy Northern industrialists who came by scheduled rail and private rail cars to hunt and enjoy the pine-scented air. The old and then unproductive plantations were soon discovered and by 1890, all of the 70 plantations in the Thomasville area had been acquired for use primarily as private hunting preserves and retreats. In 1887, Cedar Grove was acquired by Dr. John Metcalfe of New York who used it as a hunting lodge. He renamed Cedar Grove to Susina. Dr. Metcalfe had a wife named Susan and wild plum grew on the property. Susina is Italian for plum. In 1891, A. Heywood Mason of Philadelphia purchased Susina Plantation and approximately 6400 acres (2590 ha). He had made his fortune by developing shoe polish, called shoe blackening at the time. He added side porches to the house and probably the rear kitchen wing. He later expanded the dining room by enclosing a portion of the south porch.
The community around Susina was initially called Duncanville. Maps dated from 1887 until 1906 show the town as Susina. After 1906, the area become known as Beachton. Originally located in Thomas County, Susina Plantation is now located in Grady County which was formed out of Thomas and Decatur Counties in 1905.
A. Heywood Mason died in 1911 and the plantation was managed by his wife, Anna. After her death in 1931, A. Heywood Mason's son, James Mason II, managed Susina Plantation. His sister, Elanor Mason Butler and her husband expanded the nearby cottage to circa 1925. In 1951, the land at Susina was divided among four heirs. One grandson of A. Heywood Mason, A. Heywood Mason II, bought the interests of his brother and two sisters in the main house and the immediate dependencies. A. Heywood Mason II conducted repairs and renovations in 1951 and 1967. Susina Plantation was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1970.
Modern.
In 1980, Susina Plantation was acquired by Anne Marie Walker and was operated as a bed and breakfast. Notable guests were Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward, a Thomasville native. In 2000, Randall and Marilynn Rhea of Atlanta acquired the property for use as their private residence, and they hired general contractor Terrell Singletary of Thomasville to repair and renovate the main house and four of the dependencies. More recently, Susina Plantation has hosted events for the Grady County Historical Society, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Thomas County Museum of History. The main house at Susina Plantation is considered by some to be one of the finest examples of the Greek Revival style. It was selected for the cover image of two books covering antebellum houses.
Architecture.
The main house sits on a knoll surrounded by large and mature live oak and magnolia lawns. John Wind's early work, such as Greenwood and Susina, were in traditional Greek Revival style. Later at Eudora and Fair Oaks, he skillfully added his own style which tended toward a later romantic or Oriental period. Susina's Ionic portico is supported by four two-story, fluted and tapered round columns. The portico extends across approximately three-fourths of the facade. The house was constructed from heart-pine cut on the property. The siding is clapboard except under the portico where the siding is set flush to resemble stone. The entablature runs completely around the house. The frieze of the portico is plain with large dentils under the cornice. The dentils are continued around the projecting cornice of the pediment. A sunflower rosette, perhaps hand carved by Wind, is in the center of the pediment. A cantilever balcony is under the portico, over the front door.
The front double door is eight by seven feet and has sidelights and a fixed transom with lattice work created by strips of wood. The molding around the door has a fret design at the upper and lower corners with fluting running the length of the posts. The door to the balcony is a seven by seven foot version of the main door. The first and second level windows have nine over nine lights and triangular pediments. The windows are six feet six inches high by two feet ten inches wide.
The plan is a basic four over four room layout with a central enclosed breezeway. In the original 1841 house, the rooms on the north (right) side of the house were not as deep as on the south, so the rear included a covered porch. A symmetric, circular staircase ascended from the north side of the breezeway to the left side of the top hallway. A room was formed on the second level behind the circular stairwell. The stairwell includes a small, decorative niche. Each room includes a fireplace that extends into the room approximately three feet. Mantels are supported by pilasters of varying design. The interior uses wainscoting throughout with top projecting molding serving as a dado. Door and window moldings are fluted with lintel sections. Simple crown molding completes a relatively simple but elegant woodwork style.
Circa 1891, A. Heywood Mason added porches that extend the full length of the house on both the north and south sides. The architect is unknown. Mason also probably added the rear kitchen wing. No photographs prior to 1895 of the rear of the house are known, so dates of renovations at the rear are in question. Between 1891 and 1930, the 1841 rear porch was enclosed to form new rooms on both levels. A south rear screened sleeping room above the side porch was added circa 1925. This sleeping porch and a rear race for air conditioning were removed by the Rhea's in 2000 to return the exterior to an earlier period.

Commingled Containers

Commingled Containers is an experimental short film by Stan Brakhage, produced in 1997.
Production.
In the several years preceding 1997, Brakhage had, for financial reasons, moved away from photography and produced most of his work by painting directly onto celluloid. In 1997, Brakhage was diagnosed with bladder cancer. Just prior to exploratory surgery, Brakhage purchased a Bolex camera, which he used to produce "Commingled Containers," described as a "last testament" of sorts. He immersed his camera into the waters of Boulder Creek, Colorado to capture the patterns created by the friction between water and rock.
Reception.
"Commingled Containers" is often interpreted in light of Brakhage's health problems at the time, and is considered to represent the director's own spiritual quest. Scott MacDonald describes the film as "a talisman that expresses Brakhage’s determination to continue his spiritual quest and to offer viewers something of Light, despite his fear of mortality, for as long as it was given to him to remain in the flow of life." R. Bruce Elder wrote that "Commingled Containers", unlike most of Brakhage's work, "remains a nearly organic (or biomorphic) abstraction across its entire length."

Fromund Le Brun

Fromund le Brun ( died 1283 ) was an English born cleric and judge in Ireland who became Lord Chancellor of Ireland, but failed in his attempt to become Archbishop of Dublin.
He is first heard of in Ireland in 1248 as a clerk to the Justiciar of Ireland, and is said to have gained considerable judicial experience in this way; he was appointed Lord Chancellor in 1259 and held the office with ( possibly ) one intermission until his death in 1283. He was the choice of the Priory of the Holy Trinity to be Archbishop of Dublin in 1271, but 
Pope Gregory X declared his election void. 
He bought Roebuck Castle, in the south of Dublin in 1261; it is possible the purchase caused him financial loss since he was rumoured to be in heavy debt shortly before his death. The Le Brun family remained at Roebuck until the later fifteenth century, when it passed by marriage to the first Baron Trimlestown.
He was succeeded as Chancellor by Walter de Fulburn.

Stowaway (Fringe)

"Stowaway" is the 17th episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series "Fringe", and the 60th episode overall. It followed the Fringe team's investigation into a woman, Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson), who repeatedly but unsuccessfully tries to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Olivia continues to serve as the host for William Bell, to the dismay of most of her other team members.
The episode's story was written by Akiva Goldsman, Jeff Pinkner, and J. H. Wyman, while Danielle Dispaltro contributed its teleplay. Charles Beeson served as the director. Along with Malcomson, "Stowaway" featured a guest appearance by previous "Fringe" actor Seth Gabel. Though Leonard Nimoy had recently retired, the writers still had storylines involving his character, leading to their decision to have Bell possess Olivia's body.
"Stowaway" first aired in the United States on March 18, 2011 to an estimated 3.8 million viewers and a 1.3 ratings share for adults aged between 18 and 49. This was the series' lowest ratings share for adults up to that point. Reviews of the episode were generally positive, as multiple critics praised Anna Torv's Nimoy impression as well as Joshua Jackson's reaction to it.
Plot.
Following from "Os", Olivia's (Anna Torv) body has been possessed by William Bell. Though he promises that no harm will come to Olivia while he seeks a suitable host for his mind, Broyles (Lance Reddick) demands that Bell leave Olivia in 48 hours. Bell begins searching local hospitals for a host.
They are alerted to eyewitness accounts of a woman who, after jumping with another man from a high roof and crashing onto a taxi parked below, simply walked away. As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able to walk away from the morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying.
Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Lincoln find that Dana worked as a suicide hotline operator, and in investigating her belongings, find that she appears to have a strong desire to take her soul to heaven or hell. Lincoln comes to believe that Dana may be looking for way to have her soul "stow away" with that of another to join her family in the afterlife, and used the suicide hotline position to find those who are close to committing suicide.
Another man is found dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his apartment. Evidence in his apartment points to the construction of a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.
Peter returns home where Walter has invited Bell to stay the evening. Bell explains that he believes that Dana was finally able to die after serving a purpose—saving the lives of the people on the train. When church bells go off nearby, Olivia's personality slips through momentarily. Bell regains control, but expresses new-found fear that his possession of Olivia's body has become more complicated than he thought.
Production.
The episode's teleplay was written by Danielle Dispaltro, while the story was contributed by consulting producer Akiva Goldsman and co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman. "Supernatural" veteran Charles Beeson directed. The episode was shot in early February 2011.
Despite previous guest actor Leonard Nimoy's recent retirement, the writers still had plot lines concerning his character William Bell. Some months prior to the airing of "Stowaway", Nimoy and others had noted that Bell's character would return to "Fringe". Anna Torv, who portrays Olivia, was not aware that her character would be channeling Bell until just prior to filming of the episode, and stated of the role, "This is not one I had been asking for!" To prepare, Torv sought advice from her fellow star John Noble, as both as a friend and because Noble's character, Walter, had spent the most time with Bell. She took further advice from the show's dialect coach and reviewed footage of Nimoy's previous work, though eventually she decided to jump right into the role. Noble later commented "I think the solutions she came up with – taking the essence of the man, playing with the eyebrows, simulating the voice — were really smart. We had a lot of fun doing it." 
Both executive products J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pickner were both impressed with Torv's take on the role, with Wyman stating that it "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was "the most proud and most impressed" with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance "so creepy". He explained, "In the episodes, you see I can barely look at her. I think it ended up being a good way to play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the fact that when that voice came out of her, I was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for "a couple" episodes, and also warned that "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as "Bellivia".
"Stowaway" featured a guest appearance by actress Paula Malcomson, her first and only time on the show to date. Guest actor Seth Gabel had previously played just one version of character Lincoln Lee, who existed as the head of Fringe division in the parallel universe. "Stowaway" marked the first appearance of the character from the prime universe. Gabel described his prime universe character as someone who works for the FBI, "but has no idea about Fringe Division. He's more of a desk jockey eventually comes to believe there is much more than reality suggests". Executive producer Jeff Pinkner described Lincoln's introduction as "insanely fun -- the characterization Seth has created just makes you smile". Gabel also indicated the new character would likely return for more episodes.
As with other "Fringe" episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in "Stowaway", with the intention of having "students learn about magnetism and how magnets can be created and demagnetized."
Reception.
Ratings.
"Stowaway" was watched by an estimated 3.8 million viewers with a 1.3 ratings share among those 18-49 on its first broadcast. It fell 13 percent in this ratings share from the previous week's episode. This was the lowest viewership for the show in the 18–49 adult demographic, though this has been partially attributed to the onset of daylight saving time and the NCAA Tournament. For that night, "Fringe" helped the Fox network finish in first place among the adult demographic, but it placed in third among total viewers. Time shifted viewing increased the episode's ratings among adults by 57 percent to a 2.2 ratings share. This was the largest increase in time shifting viewing for the week among network shows.
Reviews.
Television critics scribed mostly positive reviews for "Stowaway". Writing for "Entertainment Weekly", Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was "aces, very wry and amusing," and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting in response to it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from "The A.V. Club" also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't know if she was planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that "if the "villain" weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the "Fringe" writers have found to bring William Bell back." Andrew Hanson of the "Los Angeles Times" noted of Torv that her "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." He praised other facets of the episode, including how "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience "to see all the weirdness of "Fringe" through fresh eyes".
SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, noting that the actress "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in "Star Trek" a couple of years ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves."

Bloodline (Fringe)

"Bloodline" is the eighteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series "Fringe", and the 61st episode overall. The storyline follows the pregnant Olivia Dunham of the parallel universe ("Fauxlivia") as she experiences a kidnapping and acceleration of her pregnancy; meanwhile, her fellow Fringe agents Lincoln Lee and Charlie Francis attempt to locate her.
The episode's script was written by co-executive producers Alison Schapker and Monica Owusu-Breen, while Dennis Smith directed. "Bloodline" featured the return of guest actors Seth Gabel, Kirk Acevedo, Ryan McDonald, Andre Royo, and Amy Madigan. The Fox network released a "movie-style trailer" in the days leading up to the episode's broadcast as a special promotion.
It first aired in the United States on March 25, 2011 to an estimated 3.9 million viewers. Broadcasting in the wake of a fourth season renewal, the episode's 1.5/5 ratings share was a fifteen percent increase from the previous week. "Bloodline" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with several commentators characterizing the kidnapping mystery as predictable while also praising the depth of the parallel universe and its characters. Lead actress Anna Torv submitted the episode for consideration at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, but failed to receive a nomination.
Plot.
In the parallel universe, Fauxlivia (Anna Torv) is returned home by her mother Marilyn (Amy Madigan) after undergoing a pre-natal test to see if she has viral propagated eclampsia, a virus that killed her sister and sister's baby during childbirth. She believes she is being followed, and contacts Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) at the Fringe division, who sends over a security detail. By the time they arrive, Fauxlivia has been kidnapped; though they try to follow a secret tracker each agent carries, her abductors have extracted it to throw Fringe off their tracks. Walternate (John Noble) and Lincoln believe the abduction to be an inside job due to this. Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) identifies a vehicle that has passed by Fauxlivia's home at a high frequency, that being the taxi that belongs to Henry (Andre Royo). Lincoln and Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) track down Henry, who explains he has been keeping an eye on Fauxlivia, surprised to have seen her return and seeming like a different person than his previous encounters with her; Henry is unaware that he had actually helped the prime universe's Olivia to escape ("Olivia" and "The Abducted"). Lincoln, suspicious of these events, forces Walternate to admit that Fauxlivia was switched with Olivia, and that the child Fauxlivia carries is his grandchild. Meanwhile, Marilyn learns that Fauxlivia's test for the virus is positive and warns Charlie that she will die if she has the child.
During the Fringe team's search, Fauxlivia finds herself being put under a treatment to accelerate her pregnancy, bringing her child near term. She is able to escape from her captors and contact Fringe division to identify her location, but struggles from labor pains as the child is about to be born. Henry drives Lincoln to her location, and they are able to help Fauxlivia to deliver her child, a son, before medical help arrives. Fauxlivia and her child recover under tight security ordered by Walternate, fearing for their safety. The doctors determine the accelerated pregnancy outpaced the virus, thus allowing both Fauxlivia and her child to survive.
In the epilogue, as September (Michael Cerveris) the Observer, watches, a blood sample from the child is drawn discreetly by one of Fauxlivia's captors posing as an orderly, who transfers it to Brandon (Ryan McDonald), who is revealed to have developed the accelerated pregnancy procedure under Walternate's orders. Meanwhile, Lincoln and Charlie become somewhat distrustful of Walternate after learning what he hid from them. They consider that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) disappeared around the same time that Fauxlivia returned, and wonder what else Walternate is hiding from them.
Production.
"Bloodline" was co-written by co-executive producers Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, while "The Practice" veteran, Dennis Smith, directed the installment. Editor Timothy A. Good has called "Bloodline" the second of two parts – the first half was the season's third episode "The Plateau", which Owusu-Breen and Schapker also co-wrote. Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman had planned Fauxlivia's pregnancy since they conceived her character, but noted that "this isn’t going to be a normal pregnancy that you see, either. And the pregnancy is to evolve in a "Fringe" way that you don’t comprehend yet. It's not going to be your traditional love triangle, 'I'm pregnant and having a baby' story. It’s going to be "Fringe"-ified."
In late January 2011, TVline's Michael Ausiello reported actor Andre Royo was returning for one episode later in the third season. Royo made his third guest appearance of the season in "Bloodline", as cab driver Henry Higgins from the parallel universe. It is his final credit on the series to date. Amy Madigan, who plays Olivia's mother Marilyn, also returned in a guest appearance. Previous guest stars Seth Gabel, Kirk Acevedo, Ryan McDonald, and Michael Cerveris returned as Lincoln Lee, Charlie Francis, Brandon Fayette, and September the Observer, respectively. The episode also featured one-time guest actors Kendall Cross as Nurse Joyce and Françoise Yip as Dr. Rosa Oporto.
Leading up to the episode's broadcast, Fox released a "movie-style trailer" as a promotion, something they had previously done with "Entrada" and "Marionette", two episodes from earlier in the season. The video recapped the Peter/Olivia/Fauxlivia love triangle from Fauxlivia's perspective and then previewed scenes in "Bloodline". As with other "Fringe" episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in "Bloodline", with the intention of having "students learn about gestation and how it is different from species to species."
Cultural references.
Accelerated growth of yet-unborn children was a major plot element of "The Same Old Story", the second episode of the first season. While eclampsia is a real medical condition that can interfere with childbirth, the "viral-propagated eclampsia" presented in this episode is fictional. When Henry is located by the Fringe division, he is seen reading an "Opus the Peahen" comic, the parallel universe's counterpart to the "Opus" comic strip drawn by Berkeley Breathed. Also within the parallel universe, the movie "Taxi Driver" is shown to have been directed by Francis Ford Coppola rather than Martin Scorsese (though Robert De Niro was still able to improvise the "You talkin' to me?" scene), while the television series, "The West Wing", is shown to be entering its twelfth season.
Reception.
Ratings.
"Bloodline" aired the day after "Fringe"s fourth season renewal was announced by Fox Entertainment, which came in the wake of various actors communicating directly with fans to watch the series. Actor Lance Reddick noted of the renewal, "I know so often fans think that they need us... but I would be digging ditches or something else if it wasn't for you. So — thank you. Really." SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall was surprised but delighted by the network's decision, stating "That any network, let alone Fox, had the patience and the faith to renew this show is, for me, little short of a miracle. It was a week, it seems, for wonders."
"Bloodline" first aired in the United States on March 25, 2011. It was watched by an estimated 3.9 million viewers, earning a 1.5/5 ratings share among the 18–49 demographic, up from the previous episode's 1.3–1.4 rating. This was a 15 percent increase. "Fringe" helped Fox place in second for the night among adult viewers behind NBC, but the network fell into third place among total viewers behind NBC and ABC.
Reviews.
"Bloodline" has received generally mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Sarah Stegall enjoyed it, commenting that "This was one of the more quietly brilliant episodes of "Fringe" to date. Reaching all the way back to the first season for its genesis, it was still firmly rooted in the most up-to-date events, tied together several characters in a cabal of resistance, paved the way for major drama down the way, and gave us some emotional highlights we cannot expect to see from Our Side characters." "Entertainment Weekly" staff writer Ken Tucker called the episode "a beautifully modulated hour, written by Alison Schapker and Monica Owusu-Breen, that took care to establish the anxiety felt by Altivia and her mother, Marilyn (Amy Madigan) about the pregnancy." 
On a slightly less positive note, Noel Murray of "The A.V. Club" graded the episode with a B+. He remarked that it "starts out intense and crazy" but "becomes fairly predictable in its second half," as he correctly predicted Walternate's involvement in the abduction. Murray concluded, "Ultimately, 'Bloodline' is more of a plot-mover than most episodes of "Fringe". There’s no additional case to solve, and no profound theme to explore. If anything, it’s like the writers decided to inject a serum into the belly of show and accelerate the story, to get Fauxlivia’s baby out and to get on to the next phase." IGN's Ramsey Isler also didn't find the birth storyline all that shocking "since the number of people that had the power and knowledge to do this kind of thing was low." Rating the episode 7.5/10, Isler added that "the story could have used a bit more misdirection and a red herring or two to really keep us guessing, but that's a minor critique. Overall, Walternate's Machiavellian role in this story works, and the most important takeaway from this story is that it moved the overarching plot forward in one huge leap. Instead of waiting nine 'story' months for Fauxlivia's baby to pop out, we've already got the kid ready to fit into whatever plot twist the show runners have planned."
Some television critics have praised the parallel universe's characterization, with one noting that the "writers have made us care about the other side of this war, forced us to see the opposite numbers of our heroes as real and human and sympathetic; it's a brilliant move." The alternate performances of the actors in particular have been highlighted, especially those of Torv and Noble, but also those of Gabel, Acevedo, and Nicole.
Awards and nominations.
Anna Torv submitted "Bloodline", along with the season three episodes "Olivia", "Entrada", Marionette", and "The Day We Died", for consideration in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. She failed to receive a nomination.

Archiepiscopal seminary of Milan

The archiepiscopal seminary of Milan is the seminary of Archdiocese of Milan.
At present it has three seats: in Venegono Inferiore (Varese province), Seveso (Monza e Brianza Province) and in Milan, in corso Venezia. In the latter have their place the ISMI (Istituto sacerdotale Maria Immacolata), that takes care of the continuous training of priests in during the first five years from ordination, and the Istituto Superiore di Scienze Religiose; other various diocesan activities have been holding there. In the other two sites training of seminarists of theology is supervised: in Seveso the I and II theology with the corso propedeutico, in Venegono the subsequent years (from III to VI theology).
History.
The first seminary back to the times of St. Charles Borromeo: the site opened in 1564. Under the bishopric of Federico Borromeo took final form the location of the venue corso Venezia, under the name of Seminary of Porta Orientale. Besides its headquarters in Milan, St. Charles built several locations in the large diocese.
From 1638 to 1784 were seven: three in the city of Milan (the Seminary of Porta Orientale, the Seminary of Canonica, the Collegio Elvetico), four minor seminaries in Monza, Arona, Celana and Pollegio.
First reform school and then the presence of Napoleon's troops radically transformed the structure and the previous configuration: for various reasons ceased to be diocesan seminaries Celana, the Collegio Elvetico, the Seminary of Canonica and later Arona; a structure in Castello above Lecco was instead opened. In 1839 was the transfer of that seat at the Dominican convent of St. Peter Martyr in Seveso. With this step the configuration seminary route became so simplified: the ginnasio in Seveso, the liceo in Monza, the theology in Milan.
In the second part of the nineteenth century a seminary for poor students opened in Monza, entrusted to his father Barnabite Luigi Villoresi: training more flexible and open culture of the time (according to the inspirations from Antonio Rosmini) gave birth to a clergy visibly different from that formed with a more traditional way: this led to inevitable tensions. In 1900 a seminary was opened near the Duomo, which took the name Seminarietto, aimed at training those who were intended for liturgical service in the cathedral.
Following the apostolic visitation of the abbot Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, then Archbishop of Milan, the site of Venegono Inferiore was built with the intention to move there the center of the seminary. The construction began in 1928, started off in 1930 and was solemnly inaugurated in 1935. In the following decades, when the liceo classico and the last three years of theology were placed in Venegono, there were several locations: Seveso (medie-ginnasio), Masnago (elementari-medie), Arcore (medie), Merate (medie), Seminarietto del Duomo (ginnasio-liceo), Saronno (biennium theological and comunità propedeutica), Milano (School for adult vocations).
In 1966 the Cardinal Giovanni Colombo decided to transfer the theological faculty (built by Pope Leo XIII in 1892) from Venegono Inferiore to Milan, thus forming the Facoltà Teologica dell'Italia Settentrionale.
The vocational crisis in the following years forced a reorganization of the community and led to the closure of many facilities. In 1985 the site was closed in Seveso: the ginnasio was transferred to Venegono and after a few years began restructuring. When construction ended in 1998 the community since then living in Saronno was transferred in Seveso. With the gradual extinction of the minor Seminary (closed in 2002 after several attempts for renewal and revitalization), the comunità propedeutica was added to the biennium theological in Seveso.
The restore of the permanent diaconate wanted by Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini in 1986 has found its place in the headquarters of the Seminary.

2001–02 Hamburger SV season

Hamburger SV had another mediocre season, finishing in the lower reaches of the mid-table of Bundesliga. Mid-season purchase Bernardo Romeo made his mark immediately at his new club, which somewhat compensated for Sergej Barbarez loss of form. At the end of the season, Hamburg was ten points from both European qualifying and relegation.

Land of Fate

Land of Fate is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, published in 1992.
Contents.
The "Land of Fate" set described the setting of Zakhara at length. "Land of Fate" describes the maps, geography, routines of daily life, fashion, customs, organizations, class status, the legal system, magical items, languages, calendars, 12 different desert tribes, 17 deities or deity types, and 27 city writeups in the "Adventurer’s Guide to Zakhara," along with DM-only secrets for each city in the "Fortunes and Fates" book.
Publication history.
"Land of Fate" was published by TSR, Inc. as a boxed set containing a 128-page locations guide, a 64-page campaign guide, 8 loose "Monstrous Compendium" sheets, 12 cardstock mapsheets, 2 large color maps, and a plastic hex scale. Design was by Jeff Grubb with Andria Hayday, the cover was by Fred Fields, and illustrations by Karl Waller.
Reception.
Allen Varney reviewed "Land of Fate" for "Dragon" magazine #219 (July 1995). He began by saying: "It makes sense, unfortunately, that the "Land of Fate" box quickly followed the "Al-Qadim" rulebook as its first supplement. The rulebook briefly introduced the setting of Zakhara, but this set described it at length. A campaign needs this basic data", but with everything in "Land of Fate", he said, "It's all very large." He went on to say: "In principle the jottings of a campaign set can be satisfying in themselves. In the "Land of Fate" set, they make for dry reading. We get a useful chapter on all aspects of daily life, and a couple of wonderful sidebar articles on the Zakharan coffee ceremony ("the measure of a good host") and pearl diving, the stuff of memorable scenes in an adventure. The rest is a sandstorm of little details, one-paragraph character outlines, societal tidbits (we're told twice that worshippers in Zakhara "prostate" themselves), and jottings. With work you could assemble any dozen jottings into a free-wheeling adventure like the loose-jointed Arabian Nights tales, where one thing follows another without much logic. But not much of "Land of Fate" matches the screwy imagination of the best Nights tales. At times the designer's creativity clearly flags, such as in this candid beginning to an entry describing the secrets of Hilm: "The City of Kindness is boring." And, as with the rulebook, there is no hint in all these pages of how to develop these jottings into a memorable, characteristically Arabian campaign." Varney concluded the review by saying: "Parts of the "Land of Fate" boxed set enhance any Al-Qadim campaign, but its length is excessive and its inspiration uneven. Unless you plan to construct a long, ambitious campaign, you can probably get along without this box."

Ivan Okhlobystin

Ivan Ivanovich Okhlobystin (; born  22 July 1966) is a Russian actor, director and screenwriter. 
Okhlobystin became popular in the late 1990s but, following a religious conversion, withdrew to a monastery and became a Russian Orthodox priest. In early 2010 he resumed his entertainment career. Later that year he was named the creative director of Euroset, Russia's largest handset retailer. 
Okhlobystin plays head of the therapy department in the medical sitcom "Interny". On 5 September 2011 he announced that he would run for President of Russia in 2012 through the "Sky Coalition", but later gave up the idea, citing the opinion of the Russian Orthodox Church.
Appearing in RTVi's (Echo Moskvy's) " Without Fools" broadcast on December 2, 2012 Okhlobystin declared himself to be a "national-patriot" and claimed to "know" that "in the year when the head of State and the head of Church in Russia will both die", he will become the next President of the new Russian Empire. Saying, "the Russian people will vote for me, and the Russian Church will anoint me", he said that he'll immediately put up a new Iron Wall around Russia and start a campaign of "cleansing", in order to "rebuild the Russian nation".
Okhlobystin is known for his homophobic views. He said that he wanted to "burn homosexuals alive", since they are a "constant threat to his children" and that he could not watch this "Sodom and Gomorrah" any longer.

Assassin Mountain

Assassin Mountain is an accessory for the second edition of the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy role-playing game, published in 1993.
Contents.
"Assassin Mountain" contains three adventures (for levels 5-9) featuring the dreaded holy slayers (assassins) of Zakhara, first in a simple robbery; then when the player characters assault the slayers' impregnable mountain fortress, Sarahin (and wind up in its nightmarish Pit of a Thousand Voices); and in a sequel nine-day murder mystery set in Sarahin, where the PCs must discover who killed the slayers' leader, the Old Man of the Mountain.
Publication history.
"Assassin Mountain" was designed by Wolfgang Baur.
Reception.
Allen Varney reviewed "Assassin Mountain" for "Dragon" magazine #219 (July 1995). He called the sourcebox "inventive", noting that Baur was involved in many Al-Qadim supplements, and that "Secrets of the Lamp" was much more characteristic of his work than "Assassin Mountain". Varney states in his conclusion of the review: "The approach in "Assassin Mountain" is unique in the Al-Qadim line. Eschewing a barrage of colorful magic, Baur develops a claustrophobic atmosphere of paranoia and intrigue. Character interactions drive the plot, and the occasional fire elementals and gibbering mouther are tools to develop the narrative. These morally ambiguous adventures, modern takes on classic Arabian settings, require and reward good role-playing. Several scenes here will put role-players through the wringer, and they'll love it. But the plots also assume highly pragmatic PCs. If you or your group wouldn't feel comfortable allying with assassins, steer clear. I have trouble with this idea myself, and though "Assassin Mountain" is an accomplished work, it's not what I think of as the stuff of Arabian adventure."

A Dozen and One Adventures

A Dozen and One Adventures is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" fantasy tabletop role-playing game, published in 1993.
Contents.
"A Dozen and One Adventures" includes thirteen short adventures, featuring weird bathhouses, deceptive ghouls, amorous succubi, passionate genies, raucous merriment with desert riders, the sacred salt bond between host and guest, a boasting contest, a mummified talking head in the Hall of Lost Kings, Greek fire, a deranged fire mage, and the Brotherhood of True Flame. The adventures start with beginning characters, and the finale finishes with characters of levels 9-12.
Publication history.
"A Dozen and One Adventures" was designed by Steven Kurtz.
Reception.
Allen Varney reviewed "A Dozen and One Adventures" for "Dragon" magazine #219 (July 1995). He declares, "Now this is the stuff of Arabian adventure", and notes that "a lot of fire burns through the last half of these thirteen short adventures, despite one late episode in an inundated sand castle". Varney concludes with this assessment: "Starting with beginning characters, the "Dozen and One Adventures" develop a more-or-less continuous narrative up through the finale, for levels 9-12. Here the PCs become pawns, and occasionally onlookers, in a deadly struggle among the fire mage, the Soft Whisper assassins, a Leper King, and other high-power factions. Still, Kurtz (who has read all the Arabian Nights tales — "including the supplements!" he says, as if incredulous at his masochism) has summoned the flavor of the genre with impressive skill."

History.
Kunchacko established a film production company named "Udaya Pictures" in 1942, though he continued production at traditional the base of Malayalam film, Chennai, but it all changed in 1947 when he came together with film distributor K. V. Koshy and established Udaya Studios in Alleppey (Alappuzha), and in time the studio also set up its own distribution network. Soon it had a string of successes with blockbusters like "Thacholi Othenan", "Unniyarcha", "Palattu Koman", "Aromalunni" and "Kannappanunni", and became a household name.
After Kunchako's death in 1976, his son, director Boban Kunchacko, took over the functioning, but after his death in 2004 at the age of 55, the studio saw some bad days. 
However, Dr. Avinash Unnithan (Suryamangalam Group) has taken up the studio and it is being renovated and revamped in an attempt to bring it to its past glory, as per the need of the time, like an air-conditioned shooting floor and other facilities attached to it.

Contents.
"The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook" covers sha'irs and also the elemental mages of Zakhara. Presented in the familiar "Complete Handbook" format. it gives role-playing and campaign advice (apprentices, dueling practices), new wizard kits (astrologer, numerologist, clockwork mage, and others), almost a dozen secret magical societies, and ten pages of new spells and proficiencies. The Mechanician, for example, crafts clockwork automata to cast his spells.
This book details the wizards of the Al-Qadim setting, including the core kits of Sha'ir, Sorcerer, and Elemental Mage. It also introduces a number of additional kits.
Publication history.
"The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook" was written by Sam Witt and published by TSR as a 128-page softcover.
Reception.
Allen Varney reviewed "The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook" for "Dragon" magazine #219 (July 1995). Varney comments: "The kits work well, especially the Mechanician [...] But the societies come out of nowhere, adding a needless layer of campaign complexity ungrounded in Arabian folktales or the Zakharan campaign. If you want a secret society of desert mages, play in the Dark Sun world. Flatly written and wordy, "The Complete Sha'ir's Handbook" offers some useful advice on topics like genie prisons and caring for familiars, but its new spells look unusually powerful, as does the wizard assassin called the Spellslayer. Look before buying.

The Last Blitzkrieg

The Last Blitzkrieg is a 1959 World War II film produced by Sam Katzman and filmed at Veluwe and the Cinetone Studios in Amsterdam for a Columbia Pictures release. Arthur Dreifuss directed Van Johnson in a fictional account on Operation Grief in the Battle of the Bulge. Columbia contract stars Dick York and Kerwin Mathews also star in the film. Technical advisor to the film was Major John W. McClain who was a company commander with the 23rd Infantry. A novelisation of the screenplay was written by Walter Freeman.
Plot.
Several American GIs plan an escape from a German Prisoner of War camp. Among them is a German, Lt Von Kroner known to them as Sgt Richardson who is working under cover spying on the prisoners and polishing up his American English. Reporting the escape plan to the Camp Commandant, Von Kroner is told he is being removed from the camp as part of a top secret project gathering all fluent English speaking members of the Wehrmacht for an unstated reason.
Von Kroner is sent to a German castle with others for Operation Grief, called "Operation OK Butch" in the film where they will dress in American uniforms and spearhead the Ardennes Offensive by committing sabotage, confusing enemy forces and seizing key objectives for the attacking German forces. Assisting in the training, Von Kroner is assigned a team of three other men with various skills including a Waffen SS Officer, Wilitz who regales his comrades with stories of his exploits in terrorising unfortunates whilst a member of the Brown Shirts.
Von Kroner's team's activities and the initial German assault meet success but both soon run into unexpected difficulty. Von Kroner's forged orders are countermanded by a decimated American infantry company of the 23rd Infantry that forces them into being replacements whilst the bad weather making the German assault successful ends with American air power attacking the Germans. In their new unit Von Kroner meets his two fellow American prisoners Sgt Ludwig and Cpl Ennis who said they were the only survivors of their escape that the Germans knew about and ambushed.
Obtaining plans against the American attack against a strategic crossroads, Von Kroner warns the Germans by radio of the American attack but is ordered to stay with the Americans to ensure their attack fails. Von Kroner's team sabotage a jeep with a bomb killing the company commander, and attempt to destroy the unit's other vehicle, a weapons carrier that arouses Ludwig's suspicion.
The company attacks a German position with Wilitz using the opportunity to shoot their lieutenant in the back placing Ludwig in command. Several German prisoners are taken with Richardson/Von Kroner volunteering to take them to Battalion headquarters. He returns to tell his comrades that the prisoners didn't want to escape; they wanted to surrender to the Americans with Von Kroner taking them in. A furious Wilitiz insists that Von Kroner should have shot the lot of them.
With news of German infiltrators behind American lines spreading, Ludwig is further suspicious when Wilitz doesn't know what the American "hot foot" is.

Jaga (Muslim caste)

The Jaga are a Muslim community found in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. They are also known as Jagawa and Jagabhatt.
Origin.
The Jaga are converts from the Hindu Jaga Bhatt caste. Like other Bhatt communities the Jaga were once a community of professional singers and genealogists. The Jaga are found in the districts of Shahjahanpur, Bareilly, Farrukhabad, Hardoi, Unnao and Lucknow. They speak Urdu among themselves, and Hindi with outsiders.
Present circumstances.
The Jaga are divided into two sub-groups, the Ladua and Laggiha. Each of these two groups are strictly endogamous, and intermarriages between the two groups is rare. In fact, like other Uttar Pradesh Muslims, the community practice both cross cousin and parallel cousin marriages. The Jaga are entirely Shia, but also incorporate folk beliefs.
Traditionally, the Jaga were engaged in composing poetry and reciting the poetry on special occasions. They were dependent on patrons, who were often the large landowners known as zamindars and in Awadh, the talukdars. With the abolishment of the zamindar system by the Indian government at independence in 1947, the Jaga lost many of their patrons. The community are now mainly employed as landless agricultural labourers.
After independence of Pakistan in 1947, many members of Jaga community migrated to Pakistan.

George Corneal

George Durkin Corneal (September 13, 1883 – December 28, 1944) was an American basketball, track and football coach. In 1909, he became the first basketball coach at the University of Michigan and led the Michigan Wolverines basketball team to a 1-4 record. He also coached football, track, and basketball at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point and Lakewood High School.
Early years.
Corneal was born in Philadelphia in 1883. He graduated from Temple University and attended the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. His first coaching job was at Ohio State University.
University of Michigan.
In the fall of 1907, he was hired as the assistant in physical training at the University of Michigan's Waterman Gymnasium. While at Michigan, he also served as the coach of the school's first varsity basketball team in 1909. "The Michigan Alumnus" announced the formation of the team in January 1909:"For the first time in the history of the University there is to be a varsity basketball team. Realizing the demand for an indoor winter sport and the presence of good material in college, the athletic authorities passed a resolution providing for a basketball team and granted them a schedule of seven or eight games for this season. Coach Corneal finds himself up against the same proposition that always faces Coach Yost and Keene Fitzpatrick. His best men are ineligible and his 'reserves' consequently give his varsity a drubbing almost every evening when they line up in practice games. ... However, the coach is working hard and admits that he expects to have a good team rounded out by the time the first game is played with M.A.C."
The Michigan team compiled a record of 1-4 under Corneal.
Boise and Rock Island.
After leaving Michigan, Corneal coached for a time at the Normal School in Boise, Idaho. At the time of the 1910 Census, Corneal was living in Boise and identified his occupation as a school teacher. 
From 1911 to 1914, Corneal was the basketball coach at Rock Island High School in Rock Island, Illinois. In three seasons at Rock Island, Corneal's teams compiled a record of 19-18.
Wisconsin - Stevens Point.
For three academic years from 1914 to 1917, Corneal was the athletic director and head basketball, track and football coach at the Stevens Point State Normal School, now known as the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point. In three years at Stevens Point, Corneal's basketball teams compiled a record of 22-12, including an 11-2 record during the 1916-1917 season. In September 1917, when Corneal accepted a position in Ohio, the move was front page news in Stevens Point. The "Stevens Point Daily Journal" wrote:"He came here three years ago and conducted the Normal athletics in a successful manner. Stevens Point under him has had football teams which each year made a bid for the conference championship. He has also had charge of the physical work among the boys. His loss will be a serious one here ..."
Lakewood High School.
In September 1917, Corneal moved from Stevens Point, Wisconsin to Lakewood, Ohio. He was hired as the athletic director, football coach, basketball coach and track coach at Lakewood High School. Corneal stepped down as the school's football coach in 1935, but he remained the track for 27 years from coach from 1917 to 1944. He was also the cross country coach from 1928 through 1943. In his obituary, the Associated Press noted that "Corneal was famed for his powerful cinder path teams which dominated northern Ohio track circles for many years." His teams won five Ohio state track titles and three Ohio state cross country titles. He coached 51 individual state track meet winners and one state cross country meet winner. Several of his teams won national honors, and his athletes broke the world schoolboy record for the mile relay in 1925, the world schoolboy medley record in 1929, and the national two mile relay record in 1930. During his tenure at Lakewood, Corneal also founded the Lakewood Relays in 1922 and served as the meet's director. 
Corneal has been inducted into the Lakewood Hall of Fame. He also served as the vice president of the Ohio Association of Track Coaches, and was posthumously inducted into that organization's Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class in 1969.
Family and death.
In July 1912, Corneal married Rachel V. Abott at Bon Homme County, South Dakota. They had a son, George A. Corneal, born in approximately 1916 in Wisconsin.
Corneal died in 1944 following an illness of several months.

Humphrey Forman (26 April 1888 – 21 May 1923) played first-class cricket in two matches, one each for Cambridge University and Somerset in the 1910 cricket season. He was born at Repton, Derbyshire and died at Bangkok in Thailand.
Humphrey Forman was the son of Arthur Forman, a master at Repton School and himself a first-class cricketer for Derbyshire County Cricket Club. Humphrey was educated at Shrewsbury School. As a first-class cricketer, he was a lower-order batsman and a left-arm medium-pace bowler. He was quite successful as a bowler in his one first-class match at Cambridge University, taking four Kent wickets for 62 runs, more wickets than any other Cambridge bowler. He played a second match for Cambridge a week later against the Free Foresters; this match was not classed as first-class (though many such fixtures between these teams were in other years), but in any case Forman was not successful. In his solitary match for Somerset later in the same season, he opened the bowling but took only one wicket in the match.

Mahantango Creek (Snyder County)

Mahantango Creek (also known as Mahantongo Creek) is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Snyder and Juniata counties, Pennsylvania, in the United States. Its name comes from a Delaware Indian word meaning "where we had plenty to eat". The creek flows along the border between Snyder County and Juniata County.
Historically, numerous sawmills and gristmills have been built on the creek. The first inhabitants of the area arrived in the late 1700s. The watershed of the creek has an area of . Trout inhabit the tributaries of Mahantango Creek, but not the main stem. Smallmouth bass, however, may inhabit Mahantango Creek itself.
Course.
Mahantango Creek begins at the border between Perry Township, Snyder County, Chapman Township, Snyder County, and Susquehanna Township, Juniata County. The creek's headwaters are at the confluence of North Branch Mahantango Creek and West Branch Mahantango Creek, near Pennsylvania Route 104. It heads southeast for a short distance and then turns northeast. Shortly afterwards, it turns southeast again, passing by the community of Mahantango. The creek then turns nearly due-south and crosses under U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 15. Shortly afterwards, it reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River.
Mahantango Creek joins the Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth and upstream of Harrisburg.
Tributaries.
Mahantango Creek has two named tributaries. These are North Branch Mahantango Creek and West Branch Mahantango Creek. West Branch Mahantango Creek is long and North Branch Mahantango Creek is long. Both of these tributaries' headwaters are in Bald Eagle State Park.
Hydrology, geography and geology.
There is a broken flint ridge between Richfield and Mahantango Creek. A feature known as McKee's Half Falls is located near the creek's mouth. There are also limestone and sandstone formations at the mouth of the creek. A rock formation known as the Marcellus black slate forms visible outcrops at the headwaters of the creek.
Mahantango Creek forms part of the border between Snyder County and Juniata County.
In 2009, a $600,000 project was to alleviate soil erosion on Mahantango Creek was carried out. There are also no-till planting practices being done in the creek's watershed to reduce the amount of sediment flowing from it into the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay.
The water temperature of Mahantango Creek can be as high as .
Watershed.
The watershed of Mahantango Creek has an area of . The watershed is located in Snyder County and Juniata County.
Parts of the watershed of Mahantango Creek are rural and is mostly used for agricultural purposes.
History.
Mahantango Creek's name comes from the Delaware word "mahantongo", which means "where we had plenty to eat". It was apparently named after a group of Native Americans had a large meal on the creek.
George Herrold had a tract of land on the creek in 1765. It is unlikely, but possible, that Peter Shaffer settled on the creek around 1765. Michael Witmer gained access to a tract of land on Mahantango Creek around 1770.
In May 1772, there were plans to construct a road from Sunbury to Mahantango Creek. The Mahantongo Methodist Circuit historically included the watershed of the creek.
Historically, there were twelve gristmills and fourteen sawmills on Mahantango Creek and its tributaries. As late as 1919, there were still a large number of mills in the watershed, including the Old West Perry Mill, producing fermented pear cider, or perry, which was built in 1778.
In March 1901, flooding and ice jams severely damaged a number of bridges over Mahantango Creek. There are two covered bridges located on Mahantango Creek near Pennsylvania Route 104. One of them is called the North Oriental Covered Bridge and was built in 1908. The other is known as the Sheaffer Covered Bridge and was built in 1907. Both bridges are burr arch truss bridges.
Biology.
The Mahantango Creek Confluence Pools are a series of small pools located near Mahantango Creek in Susquehanna Township, Juniata County and Snyder County. These pools are surrounded by hardwood forests, which have been somewhat affected by logging. Additionally, there are vernal pools on the tributary West Branch Mahantango Creek. These are known as the West Branch Mahantango Creek Vernal Pools.
Mahantango Creek flows through an area of forest with an area of greater than .
Mahantango Creek is not stocked with fish. It is, however, a warmwater community for fish. No trout inhabit the creek, although it is possible that smallmouth bass inhabit it. However, trout are stocked on the tributary West Branch Mahantango Creek. Brook trout have inhabited North Branch Mahantango Creek in the past.
A barn on the floodplain of Mahantango Creek is inhabited by 30,000 bats. These include little brown myotis bats and big brown bats.

G. David Gearhart

G. David Gearhart (born June 9, 1952) is the fifth and current chancellor of the University of Arkansas. He succeeded John A. White on July 1, 2008, following 10 years of service to the university in his capacity as vice chancellor for university advancement. As chancellor, Dr. Gearhart instituted the first tuition freeze in 24 years and implemented a $220 million campus building renovation and refurbishment plan, as well as a campus-wide energy savings plan. He has also undertaken a renewed emphasis on the arts on campus, including the establishment of the “All Steinway Campus.” Under his leadership campus enrollment increased by more than 10 percent in two years, record research awards were recorded, and the university was reclassified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as RU/VH—“research university/very high,” the foundation’s top research classification.
Career in higher education.
Early career.
In 1977, Gearhart was appointed the director of development at Westminster College and led fundraising efforts for the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library. He returned to his native state in 1978 to become vice president for development at Hendrix College. After four years at Hendrix, Gearhart was selected to be the director of development at the University of Arkansas. In 1985, Gearhart was appointed vice president for development and university relations at Pennsylvania State University, becoming senior vice president three years later.
While at Penn State, he launched a major capital campaign, which raised in excess of $352 million. Total private gifts to Penn State during his 11 years at the university surpassed $950 million. In 1995, Gearhart joined the international consulting firm of Grenzebach, Glier, and Associates as senior vice president and managing director.
Career at the University of Arkansas.
Gearhart returned to Arkansas in 1998 as vice chancellor for university advancement at the University of Arkansas. In that capacity he was the architect of the Campaign for the Twenty-First Century, a billion-dollar capital campaign that concluded in June 2005 with the University of Arkansas taking its place as one of only 13 public universities at that time to have exceeded a billion dollars raised.
The centerpiece of this campaign was a $300 million gift from the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation, the largest gift ever made to a public university. The direct results of Gearhart’s leadership in this effort included the creation of 132 new endowed faculty positions, 1,738 new student scholarship and fellowship funds, dozens of new and renovated facilities and classrooms, and growth of the overall endowment from $119 million in 1998 to nearly $900 million by the time he assumed the chancellorship.
In 2013, Gearhart became embroiled in a scandal with then Vice Chancellor for University Advancement Brad Choate over budget shortfalls in the fundraising division of the institution. Choate, who was subsequently fired, oversaw the overspending of University monies. Gearhart refused to release documents related to the scandal through a FOIA request from the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. Under public pressure, Gearhart requested an audit of Advancement finances by the Arkansas Division of Legislative Audit. The audit report was published on September 11, 2013. At the subsequent meeting of the Legislature's auditing committee, allegations were made that Gearhart had fostered a "culture of secrecy" and directed the destruction of relevant documents. A prosecutor then investigated allegations that the University had violated the Freedom of Information Act (which would be a criminal offense under Arkansas law). The prosecutor reported finding insufficient evidence but his investigation includes testimony from several witnesses confirming that Gearhart had told them to "get rid of" a document.
Leadership.
In addition to his responsibilities as chancellor, Gearhart is a tenured member of the faculty in the College of Education and Health Professions, holding the rank of professor. A nationally respected expert in capital campaigns, he is the author of two books, The Capital Campaign in Higher Education and Philanthropy, Fund Raising and the Capital Campaign, as well as numerous articles.
Gearhart is also an advocate for the DREAM Act, which provides a path to citizenship for alien minors.
Gearhart continues to stray away from support of spousal benefits for domestic partners and same-sex employees of the University.In 2014 following a decision from Arkansas Judge Chris Piazza, the University of Arkansas began offering spousal benefits to same-sex married couples. Following the Supreme Court's stay of Piazza's decision, the University backed out of its commitment effectively denying the benefits to employees. 
Among his current professional affiliations, Gearhart serves as vice president of the University of Arkansas Fayetteville Campus Foundation, is a member of the board of advisors for the Arkansas World Trade Center, is a member of the Northwest Arkansas Council, and is a member of the advisory board of the Pryor Center for Oral and Visual History.

Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale

The Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale, or "Roman horse of the part of the Maremma that is in Lazio", is a horse breed native to the Lazio region of Italy. An ancient breed, it was officially recognised only in 2010; it is now one of the fifteen indigenous horse "breeds of limited distribution" listed by the AIA, the Italian breeders' association. The Lazio region has assigned it the conservation status "at risk of erosion". The population numbers about 800, of which most are in the comune of Monte Romano in the province of Viterbo; a herd of approximately 200 is at Ponzano Romano in the province of Rome, and others are in the province of Rieti. 
History.
The breed register for the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale was opened on 19 October 2010, and the breed standard confirmed by Ministerial Decree 27202, dated 1 December 2010. DNA testing had shown that the traditional working horse of the Maremma of Lazio was not only physically but genetically distinguishable from its counterpart in the Tuscan Maremma, the Maremmano, with which it had previously been classed. The two populations are reported as having common origins but limited overlap, with the Roman horse showing greater variability and a higher proportion of "ancestral" genes; Ripert reports informally that the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale has 38.5% genes of the original type, while the registered Maremmano population has only 12%. The genetic study, carried out by the Consorzio per la Sperimentazione, Divulgazione e Applicazione di Biotecniche Innovative (CONSDABI), National Focal Point for Italy of the Animal Genetic Resources project of the FAO, was presented at the 12th conference on “New findings in equine practice” held at Druento (Turin, Italy), 11–13 November 2010. 
The ARSIAL (regional agency for development and innovation in agriculture of Lazio) suggests that this is the same horse breed as the "Cavallo Romano" that was well described in 19th century treatises; authors who discuss the Cavallo Romano include Moreschi (1903) and Fogliata (1910). It is also suggested that the Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale descends from the horses of the ancient Romans, such as that of Marcus Aurelius, or even of the Etruscans.
Characteristics.
The Cavallo Romano della Maremma Laziale may be bay, black, chestnut or grey; limited facial markings (star and stripe) are permitted, as are white socks. Males measure at the withers, females . The girth and cannon measurements are similar for both sexes, approximately and respectively. The head is well set on, slightly long and heavy, and the profile convex or Roman; the neck is thick, muscular and arched, the mane and tail long and thick.
The shoulder is muscular and tends to be straight, the chest is broad with substantial muscle, the girth is deep and the back is short, straight and muscular, sometimes slightly concave. The croup is broad and sloping, and the tail is set low. The legs are solid, strong and muscular, the hooves broad and strong. Horses with concave profile, long or drooping ears, or poor conformation of the legs are not admitted for registration.
The action of the Cavallo Romano is lively and well-marked, and its temperament docile and courageous. It is sure-footed on even the most difficult terrain. 
For comparison, the description of the Cavallo Romano given by Moreschi in 1903 is this:
Uses.
Although sometimes employed in the past as a warhorse and as a carriage horse, the primary use of the Cavallo Romano was as a working horse for the management of open-range livestock, particularly horses, cattle and sheep. Until the land drainage and reclamation of the fascist era the Maremma region was, like the "campagna romana" and the Pontine Marshes, wild and inhospitable, and inhabited mostly by vast herds of livestock, transhumant shepherds and the "cavalcanti", the "riders", as the "butteri" of the Maremma Laziale were called. The traditions of the "cavalcanti" and their style of working riding, the "Monta italiana da lavoro", are still taught and transmitted by a small number of riding academies. In addition to herding work, the Cavallo Romano is used today as a saddle horse for trekking; other uses include agricultural and light draught work, use as pack animals, and the production of high quality meat and of milk for paediatric or cosmetic use.
