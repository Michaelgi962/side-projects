Tun Habib Abdul Majid

Tun Habib Abdul Majid bin Tun May Ali bin Tun Muhammad (1637 – 27 July 1697) was the 19th Bendahara (the ancient Malay equivalent of a Grand Vizier) of the Johor Sultanate during the late 16th century. The Johor Sultanate under Sultan Mahmud Shah II (who belonged to the Malacca-Johor royal family) saw a gradual decline of royal authority during Tun Habib's tenure as the Bendahara of Johor. Internal challenges within the Sultanate faced by Tun Habib consolidated his power as the Bendahara, in which case the Bendahara monopolised legitimate authority over the Johor Sultanate by the 1690s. After his death, Tun Habib's descendants spanned throughout the Johor Sultanate and established ruling houses in Riau-Lingga, Johor, Pahang and Terengganu.
Bendahara of Johor.
Power struggles.
Little was known of Tun Habib's early life except that he was the son of the Maharaja Sri Diraja of Johor, and that he was jostling for power and recognition with his rival, Laksamana Tun Abdul Jamil during the reign of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III.
In 1677, Sultan Ibrahim Shah appointed Tun Habib as the Bendahara of Johor and was assumed the title of "Bendahara Seri Maharaja" the following year. Nevertheless, his authority was quickly overshadowed by the more powerful and experienced Laksamana (who assumed the title of Paduka Raja Laksamana), Tun Abdul Jamil. Tun Abdul Jamil, seeking the advantage of having an inexperienced Sultan, quickly established his power centre at Riau and overshadowed the Sultan's authority and proclaimed himself Regent. He stopped paying tributes to the Sultan even before Sultan Ibrahim Shah's death in 1685, and appointed filled the top ranks with his family members. Naturally, these appointments earned the wrath of many chiefs and top ministers, including Tun Habib himself. The Laksamana, unable to withhold the tremendous opposition from Tun Habib and his allies, fled to Terengganu in 1688 where he was shortly killed after that. Shortly after Tun Abdul Jamil's expulsion, Tun Habib went over to Riau and took the young ruler, Sultan Mahmud Shah II back to Johor.
Later career.
The death of Tun Abdul Jamil allowed Tun Habib to reassert his position as the Bendahara once more. Tun Habib's return saw the position of the Bendahara in a more powerful position, given that the ruler was deemed too young and inexperienced to exert effective control over Johor's affairs. At least on the ceremonial side, Tun Habib swore allegiance to the young Sultan even as he wielded sole effective authority over the kingdom. In April 1691, a Dutch mercenary fleet visited Johor to seek for trade agreements with Tun Habib, to which he steadfastly turned down by citing that he was not to sign any agreements on his own accord until the Sultan reaches maturity of age.
Tun Habib was also reportedly well-loved and respected among his subjects and often worked closely with his ministers (Orang Kaya). Shortly after he regained power, Tun Habib relocated the Johor Empire's capital to Kota Tinggi. He also took charge of state affairs by proxy in Terengganu, at that time a sparsely populated state. Sultan Mahmud was given more opportunities to participate in state roles under Tun Habib, although it was the latter who wielded the actual control over the Sultanate's affairs. Tun Habib later died in Padang Saujana, Kota Tinggi in 1697, where he was buried. His oldest son, Abdul Jalil, succeeded him as the 20th Bendahara of Johor but usurped the throne from Sultan Mahmud Shah II just two years later in 1699 and took the title Sultan Abdul Jalil IV. His 5th son, Zainal Abidin, who was living in Pattani, came down to Terengganu and became its first Sultan.
Family.
Ancestry.
Tun Habib's mother was of Malay ethnicity; while his father was of mixed ancestry. His great-grandfather, Sayyid Abdullah Al-Aidrus, was a Hadhrami Arab immigrant who settled in Aceh and married the daughter of Sultan Alauddin Mansyur Shah. Their son, Sayyid Zainal Abidin, migrated to Johor and married the granddaughter of Tun Sri Lanang by his son, Tun Jenal, the 5th Bendahara of Sekudai. It was from this union that the Maharaja Sri Diraja, the Dato Pasir Diraja (Sayyid Ja'afar) and Putri Bakal were born. Putri Bakal was believed to have later married Sultan Mahmud Shah II.
The name "Habib" was a local Achinese variant of the "Sayyid", an honorific title used by descendants of the Prophet Muhammad. However, in lieu of terse relations between Aceh with its neighbours in the 16th century, Tun Habib's name revealed his Acehnese heritage served to raise suspicions when it came to political matters. His descendants gave up the use of "Habib" in their names.
Descendants.
Tun Habib had several sons by different wives, all of whom rose to influential positions. He had at least six sons: Tun (Habib) Abdul Jalil, Tun Abdullah, Tun Abdul Jamal, Tun Mas Anum, Tun Zainal Abidin and Tun Mas Jiwa were all later appointed as Bendaharas. Among these sons, Tun Abdul Jalil and Tun Zainal Abidin later established their own independent ruling houses in Johor-Riau and Terengganu respectively.

Kenneth Francis

Kenneth Francis (died 2011) was a United Kingdom politician and a former leading member of the London British National Party (BNP). He was expelled from the party in 2002 because he had a foreign girlfriend.
Francis was the former BNP organiser for Newham in east London and had been a candidate for the BNP in the 1997 general election, securing 3.6% of the votes. His membership was withdrawn for living with teacher Annie Hernandez, an asylum seeker from Ecuador. The expulsion came despite party leaders, including chairman Nick Griffin and his then deputy Tony Lecomber, being regular guests at the couple's home. Hernandez also attended several party conferences. 
Francis claimed that no one from the BNP criticised the relationship until November 2000 when he received a letter from Lecomber telling him he should leave the party. Francis said, "They had always made out that they didn't have a problem with her. Then they stabbed us in the backs." However, Lecomber told "The Times" that he and other BNP officials had disliked Francis's relationship with Hernandez, but had not been able to act because Francis had powerful supporters within the party; they had since been ousted. Lecomber said: "I didn't like it one bit. I used to put up with it on sufferance." 
According to the "Evening Standard", Francis's departure damaged the BNP in East London, the site of its first success in local elections in 1993 when Derek Beackon was elected as a councillor in Tower Hamlets. Under Francis' leadership, the area had the highest number of BNP candidates anywhere in Britain for the 1999 European Parliament elections. However, in March 2001, the BNP was beaten by the Christian People's Alliance in a by-election in the Beckton ward in Canning Town, leading the party to withdraw from the area.
He died on 21 June 2011 from cancer.

Candour (magazine)

Candour is a British far right-wing magazine founded and edited by A. K. Chesterton until his death in 1973. 
It was founded in 1953 as the successor to "Truth" newspaper of which he had been deputy editor. "Truth" had been acquired by the Staples Press, who insisted on a new editorial policy and as a result Chesterton resigned.
Chesterton issued a statement "Truth has been murdered" and asked his readers for backing for a new journal in the style of the old "Truth".
The initial response was not enthusiastic and the idea might have been still-born had it not been for funds received from R. K. Jeffery, a Chile-based British millionaire. Further backing then followed and "Candour" was born, with the first issue appearing on 30 October 1953.
"Candour" was intended to "serve as a link between Britons all over the world in protest against the surrender of their world heritage."
After Chesterton's death, "Candour" was edited by Rosine de Bounevialle until her own death in 1999. 
It continues to be published irregularly, with the latest issue printed in April 2014.

Moisés Simons

Moisés Simons (born Moisés Simón Rodríguez; 24 August 1889 in Havana, Cuba – 28 June 1945 in Madrid, Spain), was a leading Cuban composer, pianist, and orchestra leader. He was the composer of "El Manisero" ("The Peanut Vendor" in English) which is considered by many to be the most famous piece of music created by a Cuban musician and has since been recorded by other musicians from around the world hundreds of times.
Biography.
Early years.
Moisés Simons was born on 24 August 1889 in Havana, Cuba. The son of a Basque musician, he started studying music with his father, Leandro Simón Guergué. By the age of 9, he was the organist at his local church in the barrio of Jesús María and choirmaster of the Pilar church. At 15, he undertook advanced studies under various maestros in composition, harmony, counterpoint, fugue, and instrumentation.
Career.
Later, Simons became a concert pianist and musical director of lyric theater companies. He worked at the "Teatro Martí" where musical comedies by Ernesto Lecuona were performed. He then moved to the "Teatro Payret" under contract to the Spanish composer, Vicente Lleó, who directed a zarzuela company with whom he toured throughout Latin American including Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Central America.
In 1924, Simons founded a jazz band which played on the roof garden of the Plaza Hotel in Havana. It consisted of piano, violin, alto and tenor saxophones, flute, banjo, double bass, drums, and timbales. With Simons on piano, other members included Virgilio Diego on violin, Alberto Socarrás on alto sax and flute, José Ramón Betancourt on tenor sax, and Pablo O'Farrill on double bass. In 1928 while still at the same venue, Simons hired the famous trumpeter, Julio Cueva, as well as vocalist and drummer, Enrique Santiesteban. These were top instrumentalists were garnered top fees in those times of $8 a day.
Simons did research into the history of Cuban music publishing his articles in newspapers and magazines. He wrote the scores for stage shows and even several films. He was president of the Association of Musical Solidarity and the technical director of the Society of Wind Orchestras. 
Simons was renowned as a composer during the era of afrocubanismo, the time between World War I and World War II when the contributions of Afro-Cubans to Cuban culture were finally gaining recognition. Other celebrated composers during this Afro-Cuban awakening were Alejandro García Caturla, Amadeo Roldán, Ernesto Lecuona, Eliseo Grenet, Gonzalo Roig, Rodrigo Prats, and Jorge Anckermann.
Later years.
For much of the 1930s, Simons lived and worked in France, mostly in Paris, and was still there when World War II broke out. He was finally able to return to Cuba in 1942. He then moved to the Spanish Canary Island of Tenerife and later to Madrid, Spain where he signed a contract to provide music for the film, "Bambú", which included his last known composition, "Hoy Como Ayer" ("Today Like Yesterday" in English).
Moisés Simons died in Madrid, Spain, on 28 June 1945. He was 55.
"El Manisero".
The fame of "El Manisero" "(The Peanut Vendor)" led to Simons' own worldwide recognition. It sold over a million copies of sheet music for E.B. Marks Inc., and this netted $100,000 in royalties for Simons by 1943. Its success led to a 'rumba craze' in the US and Europe which lasted until the 1940s. The consequences of the Peanut Vendor's success was thus quite far-reaching.
The number was first recorded and released by singer, Rita Montaner, in either 1927 or 1928 on Columbia Records. The biggest hit for "El Manisero" came from the 1930 recording released by Don Azpiazú and his Havana Casino Orchestra in New York City on Victor Records. The band included a number of star musicians such as Julio Cueva (trumpet) and Mario Bauza (saxophone); Antonio Machín was the singer. There seems to be no authoritative account of the number of 78rpm records of this recording sold by Victor; but it seems likely that the number would have exceeded the sheet music sales, making it the first million-selling record of Cuban (or even Latin) music. 
The lyrics were based on a street vendors' cry, a pregón; and the rhythm was a son, so technically this was a "son-pregón". On the record label, however, it was called a "rhumba", not only the wrong genre, but misspelled as well. On the published score both music and lyrics are attributed to Simons, though there is a persistent story that they were written by Gonzalo G. de Mello in Havana the night before Montaner was due to record it in New York. Cristóbal Díaz says "For various reasons, we have doubts about this version... "El Manisero" was one of those rare cases in popular music where an author got immediate and substantial financial benefits... logically Mello would have tried to reclaim his authorship of the lyrics, but that did not occur." The second attack on the authorship of the lyrics came from none other than the great Fernando Ortíz. For Ortíz, the true author was an unknown Havana peanut seller, of the second half of the 19th century, who served as the basis for a danza written by Gottschalk. Of course, it may well be that elements of the song were to be found in real life. The English version is by Gilbert and Sunshine; the latter was Azpizú's sister-in-law, who toured with the band in the U.S.A. as singer. According to Sublette, the English lyrics are of almost unsurpassed banality.
In 1947, "The Peanut Vendor" had a second life as a hit number when Stan Kenton and his big band recorded and released it on Capitol Records. It was such a popular hit for Kenton that he would go on to rerecord it for a second time. 
Several films included versions of "El Manisero". It appeared in the MGM movie, "The Cuban Song", with Ernesto Lecuona as musical advisor; Judy Garland sung a fragment of the song in the 1954 film, "A Star is Born".
Other works.
Simons' musical compositions include lyric theater scores for the following operettas or zarzuelas: "Deuda De Amor", "La Negra Quirina", "Le Chant Des Tropiques", "Niña Mercé", and "Toi, c'est Moi" ‒ several of which were premiered in Paris during the 1930s.
"Toi, c'est Moi", the operetta co-written with popular French novelist, Henri Duvernois, and starring Simone Simon, opened at the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens in Paris in September 1934. The work consisted of a series of extremely varied numbers punctuated by humorous comedy scenes. The Cuban-born musicologist, Alejo Carpentier, praised Simons' excellent musical and technical accomplishment saying that "Toi C'est Moi" was by far the peak of Simons' creative career.
Noted compositions written by Simons include the following: "Cubanacan", "Los Tres Golpes", "Así Es Mi Patria", "Chivo Que Rompe Tambó", "La Trompetilla", "Paso Ñáñigo", "Serenata Cubana", "Vacúnala", "Marta", "Hoy Como Ayer", "Danzas Cubanas", and "Rumba Guajira".

<doc id="21378125" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21378125" title="Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories">
Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories

Water supply and sanitation in the Palestinian territories are characterized by severe water shortage and are highly influenced by the Israeli occupation. The water resources of Palestine are fully controlled by Israel and the division of groundwater is subject to provisions in the Oslo II Accord.
The West Bank's main resource of natural water is groundwater from the "Mountain Aquifer", most of it derived from rainfall and snowmelt on the Palestinian side of the Green Line. Palestinians abstract about 20% of the "estimated potential" of the aquifers that underlie both the West Bank and Israel. Israel abstracts the rest and in addition overdraws its share by over 50%, using about 1.8 times what it is allowed under the Oslo agreement. In Gaza, the only source of natural fresh water is the "Coastal Aquifer", which is heavily over-exploited and salinated as the result of seawater intrusion. The development of seawater desalination is hampered by the blockade of the Gaza Strip, which is attended with import restrictions on construction materials and fuel needed for desalination.
Generally, the water quality is considerably worse in the Gaza strip when compared to the West Bank. About a third to half of the delivered water in the Palestinian territories is lost in the distribution network. The lasting blockade of the Gaza Strip and the Gaza War have caused severe damage to the infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.
Concerning wastewater, the existing treatment plants do not have the capacity to treat all of the produced wastewater, causing severe water pollution. The development of the sector highly depends on external financing.
History.
Since 1948, the development of the water and sanition sector in the Palestinian territories is strongly linked to the development of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In 1995, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) was established by a presidential decree. One year later, its functions, objectives and responsibilities were defined through a by-law, giving the PWA the mandate to manage water resources and execute the water policy.
Water resources.
Division in the Oslo II Accord.
The 1995 Oslo II Accord allows the Palestinians in the West Bank the use of up to 118 million cubic meters (mcm) water per year. 80 mcm was supposed to come from to drill new wells. However, the PWA was able to drill new wells for only 30 mcm at the expense of the existing springs and wells. In the Oslo II Accord, the Israelis are allotted four times the Palestinian portion or 80% of the West Bank resources. However, 94% (340 mcm) of the Western Aquifer was allotted to the Israelis for use within Israel. The allowed quantities have not been adapted after the end of the supposed five years interim period. The parties established the Joint Water Committee to carry out the provisions of the concerning artikel 40 of Annex III.
Israel extracts more water from the West Bank than agreed in the Oslo Accord, while Palestinian abstractions were within the agreed range. Contrary to expectations under Oslo II, the water actually abstracted by Palestinians in the West Bank has dropped between 1999 and 2007. Due to the Israeli over-extraction, aquifer levels are near "″the point where irreversible damage is done to the aquifer.″" Israeli wells in the West Bank have dried up local Palestinian wells and springs.
Water from the Jordan River basin.
The Upper Jordan River flows south into Sea of Galilee, which provides the largest freshwater storage capacity along the Jordan River. Lake Tiberias drains into the Lower Jordan River, which winds further south through the Jordan Valley to its terminus in the Dead Sea. The Palestinians are denied any access to this water. About a quarter of the 420 million m3 Israel pumps from the Sea of Galilee goes to the local communities in Israel and to Jordan; the rest is diverted to Israel through the National Water Carrier (NWC) before it can reach the West Bank. Virtually all water from the Yarmouk River, north of the West Bank is diverted by Israel, Syria and Jordan. The water of the Tirza Stream, the largest stream in the central Jordan Valley, fed by rainwater, is diverted by Israel to the Tirza Reservoir and used by settlements in the area for irrigation of crops and for raising fish.
Other surface water.
In Gaza, the only source of surface water has been the Wadi Gaza. Since the early 1970s, however, Israel has built dams, and diverses its water for agricultural purposes within Israel prior to its arrival to Gaza.
Groundwater.
In the West Bank, the main groundwater resource is the "Mountain Aquifer", which consists of three aquifers:
According to Hiniker, at an average sustainable rate, the amount of renewable shared freshwater available throughout the entire Jordan Valley is roughly 2700 mcm per year, which is composed of 1400 million cubic metres of groundwater and 1300 million cubic metres of surface water. However, only a fraction of this can be used by Palestinians in the West Bank. Israel has denied Palestinians access to the entire Lower Jordan River since 1967. After the start of Israel’s military occupation in 1967, Israel declared the West Bank land adjacent to the Jordan River a closed military zone, to which only Israeli settler farmers have been permitted access.
In 1982, the West Bank water infrastructure controlled by the Israeli army was handed over to the Israeli national water company Mekorot. As of 2009, Mekorot operates some 42 wells in the West Bank, mainly in the Jordan Valley region, which mostly supply the Israeli settlements. The amount of water Mekorot can sell to the Palestinians is subject to approval of the Israeli authorities.
Drilling of wells into the mountain aquifer by the Palestinians is restricted. Most of its water thus flows underground towards the slopes of the hills and into Israeli territory. According to different estimates, between 80 and 85% of groundwater in the West Bank is used either by Israeli settlers or flows into Israel.
The Coastal Aquifer is the only source of water in the Gaza strip. It runs beneath the coast of Israel, with Gaza downstream at the end of the basin. With the water flows underground mainly east-west, however, Palestinian extractions from the aquifer have no effect on the Israeli side. Israel, on the contrary, has installed a cordon of numerous deep wells along the Gaza border and in this way extracts much of the groundwater before it can reach Gaza. Israel sells a limited part of the water to the Palestinians in Gaza. While Israel transports water from the north of its territory to the south, the Palestinians are not allowed to move water from the West Bank to Gaza. This is a reason why this aquifer is heavily over-exploited, resulting in seawater intrusion. The aquifer is polluted by salt as well as nitrate from wastewater infiltration and fertilizers. Only 5-10% of the aquifer yields drinking water quality. By 2000, the water from the Coastal Aquifer in the Gaza region was considered no longer drinkable due to high salinity from the sea water intrusion and high nitrate pollution from agricultural activity.
Pursuant Oslo II (Annex III, Article 40.7), Israel committed itself to sell 5 mcm/year to the Gaza Strip. This was not fulfilled. Gaza is not able to supply itself and has to either import water, or produce drinkwater by means of desalination plants.
Desalination of brackish groundwater.
In Gaza, desalinated brackish groundwater has become an important source of drinking water. Over 20,000 consumers in over 50% of the Gaza households have installed domestic ‘reverse osmosis’ (RO) units to desalinate water for drinking purposes. The water quality is high, though the water lacks basic minerals. As of January 2014, NGOs host 18 small desalination plants providing safe drinking water to 95,000 people.
In 2009, approximately 100 industrial desalination plants were operational. Due to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, the import of spare parts – essential to operate the desalination plants of industry, communities and housholds – as well as necessary chemicals, is problematic.
Desalinated seawater.
As of 2007, there was one seawater desalination plant in Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip, built in 1997-99 with funding by the Austrian government. It has a capacity of 600 m3 per day and it is owned and operated by the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility. At least initially, the operating costs were subsidized by the Austrian government. The desalinated water is distributed to 13 water kiosks.
Desalination of seawater is expected to become more important in the future through a long-planned regional desalination plant that would provide desalinated water using the piped water network throughout the entire Gaza strip. For over 20 years, a major desalination plant for Gaza has been discussed. The Palestinian Water Authority has approved a $500 million facility. Israel supports it and has quietly begun to offer Palestinians desalination training. In 2012 the French government committed a 10 million Euro grant for the plant. Arab countries, coordinated by the Islamic Development Bank, committed to provide half of the necessary funds, matching an expected European financial commitment. The European Investment Bank provides technical assistance.
A major problem is the fact that desalination is very energy intensive, while the import of fuel to produce the necessary electricity is restricted by Israel and Egypt. Furthermore, revenues from drinking water tariffs are insufficient to cover the operating costs of the envisaged plant at the current tariff level.
Rainwater collection.
In the West Bank, collection of rainwater is a very limited resource in addition to tanker truck water for Palestinians who lack connection to the water grid, notably in rural areas. However, Israeli authorities control even the collection of small quantities of rainwater. According to the 2009 report ""Troubled Waters"" by Amnesty International, some 180,000-200,000 Palestinians living in rural communities have no access to running water and the Israeli army often prevents them from even collecting rainwater. The Israeli army frequently destroys small rainwater harvesting cisterns built by Palestinian communities who have no access to running water, or prevents their construction.
Water reuse.
In view of the limited availability of water resources, water reuse is seen as an important source. In the West Bank, Israel collects wastewater in two facilities in the Jordan Valley. Not only wastewater from Israelis in Jerusalem and settlements is collected, but also from Palestinians. All recycled water is used for irrigation in settlements in the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area.
Water use.
Palestinians.
As of 2007, the estimated average "per capita supply" in the West Bank had increased to about 98 "liter per capita per day" (98 lpcd). The estimated "household use" was 50 lpcd, with many households consuming as little as 20 lpcd, even if connected to the network. Due to the fragmentation of the West Bank, movement of water from water-rich areas to Palestinian communities with water shortage is inhibited. Therefore, there are huge differences in water use in the eastern and southern West Bank. While the daily consumption in the Jericho district was 161 liters in 2009, in Jericho city even 225 liters, it was less than 100 liters in other areas. In the central Jordan Valley it was about 60 liters. Inhabitants of a-Nu’ima, east of Jericho, had only 24 liters. Residents of villages that are cut off from water supply have to buy water from watertanker operators. All of the eastern West Bank, except the Israeli settlements and Jericho are designated as a closed military area or as an area that for other reasons has access restrictions for Palestinians. In 2012, 90% of the small Palestinian communities living there had less than 60 lpcd. Over half of them, mostly Bedouin or herding communities, often cut off from their traditional wells, had even less than 30 litres per person per day.
As of 2009, the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) or municipalities provided about 70 lpcd in Gaza, but could not reach all households.
For 2012, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) provided the following figures (domestic use):
1) excl. East Jerusalem
2) including commercial and industrial uses; hence, the actual supply and consumption rates per capita are less than the indicated numbers; 93.9 MCM=105.6 lpcd and 67.9 MCM=76.4 lpcd (for given population over 365 days)
In 2012, about 44% of the groundwater was for use in agriculture. Industrial use was only 3% in 2005.
The household "use" is less than the "supply", which includes industrial, commercial and public consumption as well as losses. In the Gaza strip, for example, the estimated average "per capita supply" in 2005 was 152 lpcd, but due to high network losses, the actual water use was only 60% of it, which would be about 91 liter. The minimum quantity "for domestic use", recommended by the WHO is 100 lpcd.
Israeli settlers.
In 2008, the settlements in the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area were allocated 44.8 million m3 (MCM) of water, 97.5 percent of which (43.7 MCM) were for agricultural use. Seventy percent of it was provided by Mekorot. According to Israeli figures, the household use of settlers in the Jordan Valley was 487 liters per capita per day (lpcd) and in the northern Dead Sea area even 727 lpcd. That is three to four times the use of 165 liters in Israel. As the settlers in the in the eastern West Bank use nearly all the water use for agriculture, they in fact export water from the Palestinian Territories.
In 2009, settlers in Pnei Hever, Hebron District, consumed 194 liters per day; those in Efrat, east of Bethlehem, 217 liters.
Water use of Israelis versus Palestinians.
According to the Palestinian Water Authority, the average Israeli consumption of water is 300 liter per person per day, which is more than 4 times that of the Palestinian use of 72 liters per day. Some Palestinian village communities live on even less water than the average Palestinian consumption, in some cases no more than 20 liters per person per day. According to the World Bank, water extractions per capita for West Bank Palestinians are about one quarter of those for Israelis, and have declined over the last decade. In 1999, Palestinians in the West Bank used only 190 lpcd from the West Bank resources, the settlers 870 lpcd, and the Israelis used even 1,000 lpcd. Israeli settlers in the West Bank thus used about 4.5 times the amount of water available to the Palestinians.
In 2008, the settlers in the Niran settlement, north of Jericho, used more than 5 times the amount of the nearby Palestinian village al-A’uja. The Argaman settlement, in the central Jordan Valley, used more than 5 times the amount of the adjacent Palestinian village a-Zubeidat. The household use in the Ro’i settlement, in the northern Jordan Valley, was per head 21 times that of the adjacent Bedouin community al-Hadidya, which is not connected to the regular water supply.
In 2009, the settlers in Efrat consumed, with 217 liters, three times the amount of the per capita use of 71 liters in the nearby Palestinian Bethlehem Governorate.
While many Palestinians living in rural communities have no access to running water, Israeli settlers who export their products have irrigated farms, lush gardens and swimming pools. The 450,000 settlers use as much or even more water than all 2.3 million Palestinians together. Many Palestinians have to buy water from Israel, of often dubious quality, delivered with tanker trucks at very high prices. Water tankers are forced to take long detours to avoid Israeli military checkpoints and roads which are out of bounds to Palestinians, resulting in steep increases in the price of water.
Infrastructure.
Connection to the water grid.
According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) of the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, about 90% of the Palestinians in the Territories had access to an improved water source.
A 2011 survey carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) found that the number of households in the Palestinian territories connected to the water network was 91.8% in 2011. In the West Bank, 89.4% of the households were connected while the connection share in the Gaza Strip was 96.3%.
According a 2004 study by Karen Assaf, there are low service levels especially in small villages and refugee camps. The gap between urban and rural areas concerning water supply house connections may be due to the fact that available water resources are not accessible for the Palestinian actors in many cases. In 42% of the localities, water supply
got uninterrupted; 19% received it at least partially. Furthermore, about 40% of all served localities suffer from water shortages.
The Euro-Mediterranean Water Information System (EMWIS) states that continuity in the Palestinian territories is 62.8%
Water cisterns.
Due to unreliable water delivery, virtually every Palestinian house has at least one, most several water cisterns to store water. In the West Bank, water cisterns are often targeted by the IDF or Israeli settlers, destroyed under the pretext of illegality, but also for no apparent reason other, than, it would seem, shooting practice.
Drinking water quality.
Data of a survey carried out in 2011 revealed that 47.2% of the households in the Palestinian Territories consider the water quality as good. The share is significantly higher in the West Bank (70.9%) than in the Gaza Strip (5.3%). Compared to an earlier study, the results indicate that the percentage of households which consider the water quality as good decreased from 67.5% in 1999.
Water losses and sewage problems.
In 2012, the losses of water in the network were estimated some 28% in the West Bank and even half of the supplied amount in Gaza. In the West Bank, construction and maintenance of water and sewage infrastructure are problematic. The Palestinian areas are enclaves in the Israeli controlled Area C. Therefore, all projects are subject to approval of the Joint Water Committee and the Israeli army. In Gaza, the infrastructure is subject to periodical large-scale destruction by Israeli attacks, such as in the 2004 Raid on Beit Hanoun, or the 2008/2009 Operation Cast Lead. The groundwater in Gaza is highly contaminated by leaked sewage.
The high water loss rates are ascribed to illegal connections, worn out pipe systems in the networks, and utility dysfunction. Especially in the Gaza Strip, high losses are caused by illegal connections. Illegal use of water is often the result of water shortages and insufficient supply. Furthermore, the conditions of water supply utilities suffer from grave deficiencies causing high leakage rates and a weak water pulse in the system, ascribed to both institutional weakness and the restrictions posed by the occupation on the development of the water and sanitation sectors, including the Gaza blockade.
Effects of the Gaza war and the Gaza blockade.
Following the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, the World Bank reported severe damages to the water and sanitation infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. Almost all sewage and water pumps were out of operation due to a lack of electricity and fuel. Spare parts and other maintenance supplies were in urgent need to be replenished. This situation resulted in a serious shortage of water and sewage overflows in urban areas, posing a threat to public health.
The Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip impedes the provision of spare parts and thus contributes to exacerbate the problem. Several aid agencies and the top United Nations humanitarian official in the Palestinian territories therefore demanded the immediate opening of crossings. According to the United Nations, about 60% of the population in the Gaza Strip did not have access to continuous water supply in 2009.
Wastewater treatment.
About 90% of the Palestinians in the Territories had access to improved sanitation in 2008. Cesspits were used by 39% of households, while access to the sewer network increased to 55% in 2011, up from 39% in 1999.
In the Gaza strip, from the 110,000 m³ of wastewater per day which is produced in the Gaza Strip, 68,000 m³ was treated, according to a study from 2001. 20% of the treated wastewater was reused. The World Bank reported in 2009 that the three existing wastewater treatment plants work discontinuously. Damaged sewage infrastructure can often not be repaired due to the ongoing Israeli blockade. It leads to delays in repairs and a lack of electricity and fuel which would be necessary to operate the wastewater treatment facilities. The United Nations estimate that per day 50,000 to 80,000 cubic meters of untreated and partially treated wastewater are discharged into the Mediterranean Sea since January 2008, threatening the environment in the region.
In the West Bank, only 13,000 out of 85,000 m³ of wastewater were treated in five municipal wastewater treatment plants in Hebron, Jenin, Ramallah, Tulkarem and Al-Bireh. The Al Bireh plant was constructed in 2000 with funding by the German aid agency KfW. According to the World Bank report, the other four plants perform poorly concerning efficiency and quality.
Responsibility for water supply and sanitation.
Relevant laws.
The current sector legislation was established after the 1995 Oslo Accords, with a by-law establishing the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) in 1996, a 1998 Water Resources Management Strategy and the 2002 water law. The Water Law of 2002 clarifies the responsibilities of the Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) and establishes a National Water Council (NWC) with the task to set national water policies. It also establishes "national water utilities".
Policy and regulation.
General water sector policies are set by the Palestinian cabinet of ministries and the National Water Council (NWC). The council has the authority to suspend or dismantle the services of the board of directors of the regional water and wastewater services providers. The members of the council include the main Palestinian ministries. The Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) acts as regulatory authority, responsible for the legislation, monitoring and human resources development in the sector. The PWA is also in charge of water resources management. It has the mandate to carry out regular inspections and to keep a register of all water related data and information. The authority shares responsibility for irrigation with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and for environmental protection with the Environment Quality Authority (EQA).
The Joint Water Committee.
As part of the 1995 Interim Agreement, a Joint Water Committee (JWC) has been established between Israel and the Palestinian territories. The JWC was expected to implement the regulations of article 40 of the agreement which concern water and sanitation. The committee is composed of an equal number of participants by the two parties and all decisions need consensus, which means that each side has a veto. The JWC is not independent from Israel and the PA. Instead, decisions can be passed to a higher political level. Jägerskog reports several delays concerning the implementation of Palestinian project proposals within the committee, partly due to missing Palestinian funding, time-consuming approval procedures, hydrological and political reasons.
Service provision.
The Water Law No. 3 provided the legal basis for the establishment of "national water utilities". The PWA's goal is to establish four regional utilities, one in Gaza and three in the West Bank (North, Center and South). However, in reality as of 2011 only the regional utility for Gaza has been established.
West Bank. Water services in the West Bank continue to be provided by municipalities, two multi-municipal utilities and village councils. The largest and oldest multi-municipal utility in the West Bank is the Jerusalem Water Undertaking (JWU) in the Ramallah and Al-Bireh area. JWU, founded in 1966 when the West Bank was still part of Jordan, serves the two cities as well as 10 smaller towns, more than 43 villages and 5 refugee camps. A second much smaller multi-municipal utility is the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (WSSA) that serves Bethlehem and the neighboring towns Beit Jala and Beit Sahour. In other cities such as Tulkarem, Qalqilya, Nablus, Jenin, Jericho and Hebron as well as in small towns, municipalities provide water and - if existing - sewer services. Both utilities and municipalities depend to a varying extent on bulk water supply by the Israeli water company Mekorot, which delivers about 80% of the water used by JWU. In rural areas, water is provided by Village Council water departments. In the North-Eastern Jenin area a Joint Service Council (JSC) formed by six villages provides water.
Gaza strip In all 25 municipalities in the Gaza strip, water provision is the responsibility of the Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU). However, the utility is still in the process of being set up and exercise its legal tasks. The intended procedure is that the municipalities receive technical assistance by the CMWU and gradually transfer their staff and assets to it. According to the World Bank, this model led to some improvements like faster repair of leakage and economies of scale. However, the plan is far from being fully implemented. The model experienced serious problems which are mainly caused by the unstable political conditions in the Gaza strip since 2008, including differences between municipalities governed by Hamas and Fatah, so that some municipalities refused to transfer their assets and staff to CMWU.
Non-governmental organizations and universities.
Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are very active in the field of water and wastewater treatment and reuse. One NGO network is the Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network (PENGON) that was initiated after the 2000 al-Aqsa Intifada. It has more than 20 members, including NGOs, universities and research centers.
Private sector participation.
Two management contracts were awarded for Gaza in 1996 and for the Bethlehem area in 1999. In 2002, soon after the outbreak of the Second Intifada, the Bethlehem contract was terminated and the Gaza contract expired.
In Gaza, a four-year management contract was awarded to a joint venture of Lyonnaise des Eaux (now Suez) and Khatib and Alami in 1996. The contract was entirely funded by a US$ 25 million World Bank credit. According to a 1998 World Bank paper, water quality improved since the contract became active. Furthermore, water losses fell and water consumption and revenues rose. However, actual responsibility for service provision remained with municipalities. When the contract ended in 2000, it was renewed twice for one year until 2002. The World Bank reports that from 1996 to 2002, 16,000 illegal connections have been identified and more than 1,900 km of pipes have been observed for leakage. Moreover, 22,000 connections have been replaced, more than 20 km of pipes have been repaired and more than 30,000 water meters have been replaced. The amount of non-revenue water (NRW) decreased to about 30%. After the end of the contract, the Coastal Municipal Water Utility (CMWU) has been established to manage water and sanitation in the Gaza strip.
Another managemenent contract was awarded in 1999 covering water supply of about 600,000 people in the governorates of Bethlehem and Hebron, with a focus on the former one. The contract was awarded to a joint venture of the French Vivendi and the Lebanese-Palestinian company Khatib and Alami. Among other things, it included the improvement of infrastructure and billing procedures. The contract was financed with a credit of US$ 21 million, while the European Investment Bank (EIB) provided US$ 35.7 million. Mainly due to the continuing hostilities and the premature cancellation of EIB support, the World Bank rates the total outcome of the project as unsatisfactory. According to the World Bank, non-revenue water was reduced from about 50% to 24% in Hebron and only 10% in Bethlehem in 2004. Illegal connections were eliminated in Hebron and more than halved in Bethlehem.
Efficiency.
About half (44%) of the produced water is non-revenue water (NRW), water which is not billed due to leakage or water theft. The share varies widely from 25% in Ramallah to 65% in Jericho. In the Gaza Strip, NRW is estimated to be about 45%, out of which 40% is caused by physical losses and 5% by unregistered connections and meter losses.
Financial aspects.
Tariffs and cost recovery.
A water-pricing policy is under preparation. Currently, increasing block tariffs are applied in the Palestinian territories. There is no price differentiation according to the purpose (residential, commercial, industrial). The average cost of water supply is $22 per month ($25 in the West Bank and $10 in Gaza). Karen Assaf reported an average tariff of US$ 1.20 (5 NIS) per m³ in 2004. In areas where piped water is not available, water is purchased from water tankers for prices five to six times higher than for piped water. The long term objective to recover water production costs, or at least operation and maintenance costs, is still not reached.
The following table gives an overview of the distribution of households in the Palestinian Territories by the cost of monthly consumed water in 2003.
Bill collection rates average 50% in the West Bank and only 20% in Gaza.
Investment and financing.
The PWA issues periodic reports including information about projects and donor contributions. In the West Bank, the total investment cost of water projects from 1996 to 2002 amounted to about US$ 500 million, out of which 150 million were already spent on completed projects. The costs of ongoing projects were US$ 300 million, and the remaining US$ 50 million were committed to future projects. Out of the total cost of US$ 500 million, 200 million were invested in the water supply sector and 130 million in the wastewater sector. The remaining financial resources were spent in water conservation (80m), institutional and capacity building (30m), storm water, water resources and irrigation systems.
At the same time, the total investment costs of water projects in the Gaza Strip were about US$ 230 million, out of which most was spent on ongoing projects (US$ 170 mllion), while the remaining 60 million were implemented costs. About 90% of these investments were financed by grants and 10% by loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank. US$ 100 million were invested in the water sector and 40 million in the wastewater sector.
It is estimated that a future investment of about US$ 1.1 billion for the West Bank and US$ 0.8 billion is needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.
External cooperation.
About 15 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies support the Palestinian water sector. In 2006, the PWA complained that coordination between PWA and donors was "still not successful" and that some donors and NGOs were "bypassing" the PWA. Donor coordination mechanisms in the sector include Emergency Water, Sanitation and Hygiene group (EWASH) regrouping UN agencies and NGOs as well as Emergency Water Operations Center (EWOC) led by USAID. Both were established to coordinate the reconstruction after the 2002 Israeli incursions into the West Bank.
European Union.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) provided loan funding for refurbishing water reservoirs and was expected to fund the construction of the south regional wastewater treatment plant and a section of the North-South municipal water carrier in Gaza. Within the framework of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), the EIB financed operations with more than 137 million Euro in the West Bank and Gaza between 1995 and 2010. 10% of the funds were allocated to the water and environment sector.
France.
The French development agency, Agence française de développement (AFD), supports several projects in the Palestinian territories. For example, AFD finances the connection of densely populated areas of Rafah to the sewage system, the construction of water pipes and reservoirs in Hebron, and the construction of a water distribution network in six villages in the district of Jenin.
Germany.
German development cooperation has been engaged in the water and sanitation sector in the Palestinian Territories since 1994. It consists of financial cooperation through KfW and technical cooperation through GIZ, both working on behalf of the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.
KfW is engaged in Nablus, Tulkarem, Salfit, Ramallah / Al-Bireh, Jenin and Gaza City. The water supply activities focus on the reduction of non-revenue water so that the available water resources can be used more efficiently. One successful example of water loss reduction is the first phase of the KfW-supported program in Nablus: the frequency of supply for 8,000 inhabitants in the Rafidia neighbourhood was increased from every 4 days to every 2–3 days. This was achieved by reducing distribution losses from 40% to currently 30%. Sanitation activities include the construction of sewer networks and wastewater treatment. The town of Al Bireh had the only functioning wastewater treatment plant in the West Bank in 2009. The plant, which was funded by KfW, was commissioned in 2000 and operates in a satisfactory way despite the challenging environment of the West Bank. The construction of wastewater treatment plants in Gaza City, Western Nablus, Salfeet and the Tulkarem region, however, was substantially delayed as of 2009. Until 2008 new financial cooperation commitments were granted in the form of projects that identified specific investments at an early stage. This approach changed in 2008 with the approval of a new KfW-supported water and sanitation program for the West Bank and Gaza. This program is open for proposals from small and medium-sized towns if they comply with certain selection criteria. The program’s main focus is on water loss reduction.
Outcomes of technical cooperation include improved performance for the Jerusalem Water Undertaking, the utility serving Ramallah, as a result of capacity building and training. Employees of the municipality Al-Bireh were trained in operating the town's wastewater treatment plant. Wells have been drilled or rehabilitated in the Nablus and Ramallah area, supplying 120,000 people with drinking water. GTZ also supported the creation of the National Water Council in 2006. Furthermore, at least 6,000 schoolchildren have been taught water conservation measures.
Sweden.
The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) has participated in the development of feasibility and design studies for the north regional wastewater treatment plant and associated sewerage collection systems in Gaza.
United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
USAID is a leading development agency within the sector in the Palestinian territories. Their work includes the repair and rehabilitation of small scale water and sanitation facilities, rehabilitation of water and sewage networks as well as replacement of water pumps. In addition, USAID helps communities without access to piped water through water supply via tankers. In rural areas, the agency provides water collection cisterns to poor families. USAID helps to connect households to water and to install rainwater drainage pipes.
On the official web page, USAID announces to provide more than 60 km of water pipes in oder to supply ten additional villages in the southern Nablus area with potable water. By 2009, USAID has improved water supply for more than 19,500 households while about 30,000 households gained improved sanitation and connections to sewage networks.
An example of USAID's work in the Palestinian territories is the Emergency Water and Sanitation and Other Infrastructure Program. Between 2008 and 2013 USAID finances the second phase of the program. It is supposed to address the urgent need of adequate water and sanitation systems e.g. by providing emergency relief and rehabilitation of existing systems.
Another program funded by USAID from 2008-2013 is the Infrastructure Needs Program. It does not only focus on water, but also includes the financing of other infrastructure that is critical for economic growth. With regard to water, several achievements have been accomplished in 2010. For example, a water transmission line, water distribution systems, reservoirs, and steel water pipes have been built.
World Bank.
Under the Second Gaza Water and Sanitation Project which is active from 2005 to 2010, the World Bank provides US$20 million. One objective of the project is to develop a sustainable institutional structure of the water and sanitation sector. This is planned to be achieved through supporting the establishment of a Coastal Water Utility which is owned by the local governments and through increased private sector participation. In addition, the project seeks to strengthen the regulatory and institutional capacity of the PWA. The second objective of the project is the improvement of the water and sanitation services through rehabilitation, upgrade and expansion of the existing facilities.
In January 2008, another US$5 million for the project have been approved by the bank. The additional funding will contribute to finance the institutional strengthening of the Coastal Municipal Water Utility, which has suffered from a very difficult security situation. Moreover, operation and maintenance costs of the water and sanitation facilities in the Gaza Strip for one additional year are covered. One aim is to reduce non-revenue water from 45% to 35%, accompanied by an increase of revenues and customer satisfaction. The funding also provides for water meters, chemicals for water treatment and disinfection and the rehabilitation of water production wells.
In addition, the bank provides US$12 million for the North Gaza Emergency Sewage Treatment (NGEST) Project, which seeks to mitigate the health and environmental risks which arise from the Beit Lahia Waterwater Treatment Plant. Effluents of the treatment plant are discharged into a lake, putting the surrounding communities at risk. The objective of the project is to provide a long-term solution to wastewater treatment in the Gaza northern governorate. In order to achieve this, the lake is drained. New infiltration basins are built in another location, where the effluent of the lake will be transferred. A new wastewater treatment plant with improved quality standards will be built, covering the whole northern governorate.
In 2011, the World Bank approved three water and sanitation projects in the West Bank and Gaza. The Water Sector Capacity Building Project is supposed to support the Palestinian Water Authority by providing e.g. advisory support, technical assistance and staff training. The objective is to strengthen the PWA's capacity of monitoring, planning and regulating water sector development in the Palestinian territories.
Furthermore, the Water Supply and Sanitation Improvements for West Bethlehem Villages Project aims at the preparation of a feasibility study and a project concept for wastewater management and reuse in selected rural communities. Other components shall strengthen the capacity of the Water and Wastewater Department and increase the reliability of an existing water supply system.
Finally, the bank approved the third additional financing of the Second Gaza Emergency Water Project. Besides the capacity improvement of both the PWA and the coastal municipalities' water utility, the project shall ensure the management, operation and delivery of wastewater and water services.

Wyvern (film)

Wyvern is a 2009 Canadian-American made-for-television horror film produced by RHI Entertainment that premiered in the United States on the Syfy Channel on January 1, 2009. Written by Jason Bourque and directed by Steven R. Monroe, the film is the 15th of the "Maneater Series" produced under an agreement with Sci Fi Pictures. The film stars Nick Chinlund as Jake Suttner, a trucker who must stop a wyvern from eating the residents in the small town of Beaver Mills, Alaska. It was released in Region 1 on DVD on August 18, 2009. It was also released under the alternative title "Dragon". In Japan, it is titled "Jurassic Predator".
Plot.
The small Alaskan town of Beaver Mills is located just north of the Arctic Circle, meaning that the sun does not set during the summer solstice. As the town prepares for its annual celebration of this event, a wyvern is awakened from its prison by the melting of the ice caps, and first attacks a fisherman. Jake (Nick Chinlund), who is new in town, is a handyman fixing the cafe where Claire (Erin Karpluk) works. He hurts his hand and David (David Lewis), the town's doctor, comes to his house to look at it. While driving back to town, David stops in the woods to pee and is attacked by the wyvern. Sheriff Dawson (John Shaw) and Jake are having coffee at the cafe the next morning when they hear gunshots in the woods and go to investigate. It is Haas (Barry Corbin), a redneck who was attacked by the wyvern but managed to survive. They asked him what attacked him but he is unsure of what it was, and just tells them it could fly. On the way back to town, Dawson finds David's arm and then believes Haas. Colonel (Don S. Davis), who has seen the Wyvern from his house, goes in to town to warn everyone, because they are all outside for a festival. No one believes him and he goes to kill it. As Dawson goes to a friend's farm to get help, he radios to his Deputy Susie (Elaine Miles) to watch the town, but she can't understand what he says. Dawson arrives to find his friend dead, and heads back to town. Back at the town, the wyvern comes killing Susie and several other people. Jake, Claire, Haas, and an old crazy lady named Edin (Karen Austin) take shelter in the cafe. Later, Hampton (Tinsel Korey), who runs the towns radio, and Farley (Simon Longmore), just another citizen, make it to the cafe. Sheriff Dawson comes back to town but is killed by the wyvern. Jake and Claire decide to track the wyvern into the woods, where they find the Colonel, and discover the wyvern is killing anyone who tries to leave on the interstate. Jake and Hampton fix the radio tower and try to get help, but no one responds. Farley is injured trying to get supplies. The wyvern then uses David, who is still alive, as bait to get people to come out of the cafe. Jake goes to rescue him, and Farley realizes he wont make it back with David, so he distracts the wyvern to save them, but is eaten. David tells the group the Wyvern has eggs, and then dies from his injuries. The survivors decide to electrify the nest, but the wyvern comes and kills Haas. Jake takes a truck left on the side of the road and, using the eggs as bait, kills the wyvern by driving it off the cliff and bailing out at the last second. Jake, Claire, Colonel, Hampton and Edin head back to the cafe to try to radio for help again.
The film presents its own mythology surrounding the creature. According to Haas, the Wyvern is an ancient beast from Norwegian mythology. Haas further states that the Wyvern was the son of Hel, the goddess of death, who went on a rampage and bit Odin, causing the king of the Norwegian gods to imprison it in ice far to the north.
The truth is the Wyvern is from celtic mythology as the Wyvern is snake or worm like dragon that is also amphibian and hunts the England/Wales borders in the rivers Severn, Wye and Teme.

Siegfried Müller (SS officer)

Siegfried Müller (18 October 1914 – 7 April 1974) was a "Sturmbannführer" (major) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to recognize extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership by Nazi Germany during World War II.
Early life.
Siegfried Müller was born on 18 October 1914, in Krefeld on the Rhine in Germany to Paul and Wilhelmine Müller. His father was killed in 1916, fighting in World War I before Siegfried had turned two years old. In 1920 his mother was remarried to Heinrich Becker, a locksmith.
Müller attended the peoples' school in Krefeld from 1922 until 1927 and then the middle school in Essen (Altstadt), he graduated in 1933, and started as an apprentice with an architect's firm in Essen.
In 1935, Müller decided to end his apprenticeship to join the Heer, just after his twenty-first birthday in October, he was posted to the 1st Company, 1st Pioneer (Engineer) Battalion stationed in Königsberg and received his basic training. He was later selected to become an officer and commissioned with the rank of lieutenant in the Reserve in January, 1938. He was then given command of 3rd (mot) Company, 1st Pioneer Battalion. As Müller had volunteered to join the SS in April, 1934, (SS service number 230815), he transferred to the active list in November, 1938, and was posted to the SS "Totenkopf" Standarte Brandenberg with the rank of "untersturmführer" (second lieutenant).
World War II.
Müller was promoted to "obersturmführer" in January, 1940, he was awarded his first combat decorations during the Battle of France the Iron Cross II class in May and the I class in June, 1940. His next promotion to "hauptsturmführer" (captain) was in April, 1941, just before he took part in Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, and like all who suffered in the first Russian winter of the war, he was awarded the Eastern Front Medal followed by the German Cross in Gold in October, 1942, and the Infantry Assault Badge in December, 1942, which was awarded for having taken part in three or more motorized infantry assaults.
Siegfried Müller was awarded the Knight's Cross in December, 1944, for his personal bravery and leadership, by now he had been promoted to "sturmbannführer" (major) and had been transferred to the 12th SS Panzer Division "Hitlerjugend" and was in command of the 25th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment.
After the 227th Grenadier Division was unsuccessful in forcing a breakthrough through the American positions to the west of Hollerath on 16 December 1944, the next day the 25th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment was tasked to force a breakthrough towards Krinkelt.
The US 2nd Infantry Division had moved forward into the area of Rocherath and Krinkelt. In two days of hard fighting in villages and forests the 25th SS Panzergrenadier's succeeded in breaking through the US 99th Infantry Division's positions to retake Rocherath which was defended by the US 2nd Infantry Division, capturing over 450 prisoners of war.
Post war.
Siegfried Müller survived the war and returned to being an architect, living under the assumed name of Siegfried Heuser, (Heuser being his mother's maiden name). He died in Hamburg on 7 April 1974.

Personality disorder

Personality disorders are a class of mental disorders characterized by enduring maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition and inner experience, exhibited across many contexts and deviating markedly from those accepted by the individual's culture. These patterns develop early, are inflexible and are associated with significant distress or disability. The definitions may vary some according to other sources.
Official criteria for diagnosing personality disorders are listed in the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", published by the American Psychiatric Association, and in the mental and behavioral disorders section of the "International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems", published by the World Health Organization. The DSM-5 published in 2013 now lists personality disorders in exactly the same way as other mental disorders, rather than on a separate 'axis' as previously.
Personality, defined psychologically, is the set of enduring behavioral and mental traits that distinguish human beings. Hence, personality disorders are defined by experiences and behaviors that differ from societal norms and expectations. Those diagnosed with a personality disorder may experience difficulties in cognition, emotiveness, interpersonal functioning or control of impulses. In general, personality disorders are diagnosed in 40–60 percent of psychiatric patients, making them the most frequent of all psychiatric diagnoses.
These behavioral patterns in personality disorders are typically associated with substantial disturbances in some behavioral tendencies of an individual, usually involving several areas of the personality, and are nearly always associated with considerable personal and social disruption. A person is classified as having a personality disorder if their abnormalities of behavior impair their social or occupational functioning. Additionally, personality disorders are inflexible and pervasive across many situations, due in large part to the fact that such behavior may be ego-syntonic (i.e. the patterns are consistent with the ego integrity of the individual) and are, therefore, perceived to be appropriate by that individual. This behavior can result in maladaptive coping skills, which may lead to personal problems that induce extreme anxiety, distress or depression. These patterns of behavior typically are recognized in adolescence and the beginning of adulthood and, in some unusual instances, childhood.
There are many issues with classifying a personality disorder. There are many categories of definition, some mild and some extreme. Because the theory and diagnosis of personality disorders occur within prevailing cultural expectations, their validity is contested by some experts on the basis of invariable subjectivity. They argue that the theory and diagnosis of personality disorders are based strictly on social, or even sociopolitical and economic considerations.
Classification.
The two major systems of classification, the ICD and DSM, have deliberately merged their diagnoses to some extent, but some differences remain. For example, ICD-10 does not include narcissistic personality disorder as a distinct category, while DSM-5 does not include enduring personality change after catastrophic experience or after psychiatric illness. ICD-10 classifies the DSM-5 schizotypal personality disorder as a form of schizophrenia rather than as a personality disorder. There are accepted diagnostic issues and controversies with regard to distinguishing particular personality disorder categories from each other. ICD classifies Transsexualism as a personality disorder; while DSM-5 addresses Gender dysphoria.
World Health Organization.
The ICD-10 section on mental and behavioral disorders includes categories of personality disorder and enduring personality changes. They are defined as ingrained patterns indicated by inflexible and disabling responses that significantly differ from how the average person in the culture perceives, thinks and feels, particularly in relating to others.
The specific personality disorders are: paranoid, schizoid, dissocial, emotionally unstable (borderline type and impulsive type), histrionic, anankastic, anxious (avoidant) and dependent.
There is also an 'Others' category involving conditions characterized as eccentric, "haltlose" (derived from "haltlos" ("German") = drifting, aimless and irresponsible), immature, narcissistic, passive-aggressive or psychoneurotic. An additional category is for unspecified personality disorder, including character neurosis and pathological personality.
There is also a category for Mixed and other personality disorders, defined as conditions that are often troublesome but do not demonstrate the specific pattern of symptoms in the named disorders. Finally there is a category of Enduring personality changes, not attributable to brain damage and disease. This is for conditions that seem to arise in adults without a diagnosis of personality disorder, following catastrophic or prolonged stress or other psychiatric illness.
American Psychiatric Association.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (currently the DSM-5) provides a definition of a General personality disorder that stress such disorders are an enduring and inflexible pattern of long duration that lead to significant distress or impairment and are not due to use of substances or another medical condition. DSM-5 lists ten personality disorders, grouped into three clusters. The DSM-5 also contains three diagnoses for personality patterns that do not match these ten disorders, but nevertheless exhibit characteristics of a personality disorder.
Other.
Some types of personality disorder were in previous versions of the diagnostic manuals but have been deleted. This includes two types that were in the DSM-III-R appendix as "Proposed diagnostic categories needing further study" without specific criteria, namely Sadistic personality disorder (a pervasive pattern of cruel, demeaning and aggressive behavior) and Self-defeating personality disorder (masochistic personality disorder) (characterised by behaviour consequently undermining the person's pleasure and goals). The psychologist Theodore Millon and others consider some relegated diagnoses to be equally valid disorders, and may also propose other personality disorders or subtypes, including mixtures of aspects of different categories of the officially accepted diagnoses.
"* – Not actually to be classified as a personality disorder; classified instead as a form of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder."
"** – Originally proposed for deletion; status remains unclear for DSM-5."
Millon's description.
Psychologist Theodore Millon, who has written numerous popular works on personality, proposed the following description of personality disorders:
Additional classification factors.
Except for classifying by category and cluster, it is possible to classify personality disorders using such additional factors as severity, impact on social functioning, and attribution.
Severity.
This involves both the notion of personality difficulty as a measure of subthreshold scores for personality disorder using standard interviews and the evidence that those with the most severe personality disorders demonstrate a “ripple effect” of personality disturbance across the whole range of mental disorders. In addition to subthreshold (personality difficulty) and single cluster (simple personality disorder), this also derives complex or diffuse personality disorder (two or more clusters of personality disorder present) and can also derive severe personality disorder for those of greatest risk.
There are several advantages to classifying personality disorder by severity:
Effect on social functioning.
Social function is affected by many other aspects of mental functioning apart from that of personality. However, whenever there is persistently impaired social functioning in conditions in which it would normally not be expected, the evidence suggests that this is more likely to be created by personality abnormality than by other clinical variables. The Personality Assessment Schedule gives social function priority in creating a hierarchy in which the personality disorder creating the greater social dysfunction is given primacy over others in a subsequent description of personality disorder.
Attribution.
Many who have a personality disorder do not recognize any abnormality and defend valiantly their continued occupancy of their personality role. This group have been termed the Type R, or treatment-resisting personality disorders, as opposed to the Type S or treatment-seeking ones, who are keen on altering their personality disorders and sometimes clamor for treatment. The classification of 68 personality disordered patients on the caseload of an assertive community team using a simple scale showed a 3 to 1 ratio between Type R and Type S personality disorders with Cluster C personality disorders being significantly more likely to be Type S, and paranoid and schizoid (Cluster A) personality disorders significantly more likely to be Type R than others.
Signs and symptoms.
In the workplace.
Depending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty coping with work or the workplace - potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with interpersonal relationships. Indirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as substance abuse and co-morbid mental diseases, can plague sufferers. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average work abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the sufferer to exploit his or her co-workers.
In 2005, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the University of Surrey, UK, interviewed and gave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at Broadmoor Hospital in the UK. They found that three out of eleven personality disorders were actually more common in executives than in the disturbed criminals:
According to leading leadership academic Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries, it seems almost inevitable these days that there will be some personality disorders in a senior management team.
Relationship with other mental disorders.
The disorders in each of the three clusters may share some underlying common vulnerability factors involving cognition, affect and impulse control, and behavioral maintenance or inhibition, respectively, and may have a spectrum relationship to certain syndromal mental disorders:
Diagnosis.
The DSM-IV lists General diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder, which must be met in addition to the specific criteria for a particular named personality disorder. This requires that there be (to paraphrase):
The ICD-10 'clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines' introduces its specific personality disorder diagnoses with some general guideline criteria that are similar. To quote:
The ICD adds: "For different cultures it may be necessary to develop specific sets of criteria with regard to social norms, rules and obligations."
In clinical practice, individuals are generally diagnosed by an interview with a psychiatrist based on a mental status examination, which may take into account observations by relatives and others. One tool of diagnosing personality disorders is a process involving interviews with scoring systems. The patient is asked to answer questions, and depending on their answers, the trained interviewer tries to code what their responses were. This process is fairly time consuming.
Normal personality.
The issue of the relationship between normal personality and personality disorders is one of the important issues in personality and clinical psychology. The personality disorders classification (DSM IV TR and ICD-10) follows a categorical approach that views personality disorders as discrete entities that are distinct from each other and from normal personality. In contrast, the dimensional approach is an alternative approach that personality disorders represent maladaptive extensions of the same traits that describe normal personality. Thomas Widiger and his collaborators have contributed to this debate significantly. He discussed the constraints of the categorical approach and argued for the dimensional approach to the personality disorders. Specifically, he proposed that Five Factor Model of personality is alternative to the classification of personality disorders. For example, this view specifies that Borderline Personality Disorder can be understood as a combination of emotional lability (i.e., high neuroticism), impulsivity (i.e., low conscientiousness), and hostility (i.e., low agreeableness). Many studies across cultures have explored the relationship between personality disorders and the Five Factor Model. This research has demonstrated that personality disorders largely correlate in expected ways with measures of the Five Factor Model and has set the stage for including the Five Factor Model within the upcoming DSM-5.

Causes.
There are numerous possible causes of mental disorders, and they may vary depending on the disorder, the individual, and the circumstances. There may be genetic dispositions as well as particular life experiences, which may or may not include particular incidents of trauma or abuse.
A study of almost 600 male college students, averaging almost 30 years of age and who were not drawn from a clinical sample, examined the relationship between childhood experiences of sexual and physical abuse and currently reported personality disorder symptoms. Childhood abuse histories were found to be definitively associated with greater levels of symptomatology. Severity of abuse was found to be statistically significant, but clinically negligible, in symptomatology variance spread over Cluster A, B and C scales.
Child abuse and neglect consistently evidence themselves as antecedent risks to the development of personality disorders in adulthood. In the following study, efforts were taken to match retrospective reports of abuse with a clinical population that had demonstrated psychopathology from childhood to adulthood who were later found to have experienced abuse and neglect. In a study of 793 mothers and children, researchers asked mothers if they had screamed at their children, and told them that they did not love them or threatened to send them away. Children who had experienced such verbal abuse were three times as likely as other children (who did not experience such verbal abuse) to have borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive or paranoid personality disorders in adulthood. The sexually abused group demonstrated the most consistently elevated patterns of psychopathology. Officially verified physical abuse showed an extremely strong correlation with the development of antisocial and impulsive behavior. On the other hand, cases of abuse of the neglectful type that created childhood pathology were found to be subject to partial remission in adulthood.
Epidemiology.
The prevalence of personality disorder in the general community was largely unknown until surveys starting from the 1990s. In 2008 the median rate of diagnosable PD was estimated at 10.6%, based on six major studies across three nations. This rate of around one in ten, especially as associated with high use of services, is described as a major public health concern requiring attention by researchers and clinicians.
The prevalence of individual personality disorders ranges from about 2% to 3% for the more common varieties, such as schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, and histrionic, to 0.5–1% for the least common, such as narcissistic and avoidant.
A screening survey across 13 countries by the World Health Organization using DSM-IV criteria, reported in 2009 a prevalence estimate of around 6% for personality disorders. The rate sometimes varied with demographic and socioeconomic factors, and functional impairment was partly explained by co-occurring mental disorders. In the US, screening data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication between 2001 and 2003, combined with interviews of a subset of respondents, indicated a population prevalence of around 9% for personality disorders in total. Functional disability associated with the diagnoses appeared to be largely due to co-occurring mental disorders (Axis I in the DSM).
A UK national epidemiological study (based on DSM-IV screening criteria), reclassified into levels of severity rather than just diagnosis, reported in 2010 that the majority of people show some personality difficulties in one way or another (short of threshold for diagnosis), while the prevalence of the most complex and severe cases (including meeting criteria for multiple diagnoses in different clusters) was estimated at 1.3%. Even low levels of personality symptoms were associated with functional problems, but the most severely in need of services was a much smaller group.
There are also some sex differences in the frequency of personality disorders. They are shown in the table below.
Comorbidity.
There is a considerable personality disorder diagnostic co-occurrence. Patients who meet the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for one personality disorder are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for another. Diagnostic categories provide clear, vivid descriptions of discrete personality types but the personality structure of actual patients might be more accurately described by a constellation of maladaptive personality traits.

Management.
Specific approaches.
There are many different forms (modalities) of treatment used for personality disorders:
There are different specific theories or schools of therapy within many of these modalities. They may, for example, emphasize psychodynamic techniques, or cognitive or behavioral techniques. In clinical practice, many therapists use an 'eclectic' approach, taking elements of different schools as and when they seem to fit to an individual client. There is also often a focus on common themes that seem to be beneficial regardless of techniques, including attributes of the therapist (e.g. trustworthiness, competence, caring), processes afforded to the client (e.g. ability to express and confide difficulties and emotions), and the match between the two (e.g. aiming for mutual respect, trust and boundaries).
Challenges.
The management and treatment of personality disorders can be a challenging and controversial area, for by definition the difficulties have been enduring and affect multiple areas of functioning. This often involves interpersonal issues, and there can be difficulties in seeking and obtaining help from organizations in the first place, as well as with establishing and maintaining a specific therapeutic relationship. On the one hand, an individual may not consider themselves to have a mental health problem, while on the other, community mental health services may view individuals with personality disorders as too complex or difficult, and may directly or indirectly exclude individuals with such diagnoses or associated behaviors. The disruptiveness people with personality disorders can create in an organisation makes these, arguably, the most challenging conditions to manage.
Apart from all these issues, an individual may not consider their personality to be disordered or the cause of problems. This perspective may be caused by the patient's ignorance or lack of insight into their own condition, an ego-syntonic perception of the problems with their personality that prevents them from experiencing it as being in conflict with their goals and self-image, or by the simple fact that there is no distinct or objective boundary between 'normal' and 'abnormal' personalities. Unfortunately, there is substantial social stigma and discrimination related to the diagnosis.
The term 'personality disorder' encompasses a wide range of issues, each with different a level of severity or disability; thus, personality disorders can require fundamentally different approaches and understandings. To illustrate the scope of the matter, consider that while some disorders or individuals are characterized by continual social withdrawal and the shunning of relationships, others may cause "fluctuations" in forwardness. The extremes are worse still: at one extreme lie self-harm and self-neglect, while at another extreme some individuals may commit violence and crime. There can be other factors such as problematic substance use or dependency or behavioral addictions. A person may meet criteria for multiple personality disorder diagnoses and/or other mental disorders, either at particular times or continually, thus making coordinated input from multiple services a potential requirement.
Therapists in this area can become disheartened by lack of initial progress, or by apparent progress that then leads to setbacks. Clients may be experienced as negative, rejecting, demanding, aggressive or manipulative. This has been looked at in terms of both therapist and client; in terms of social skills, coping efforts, defence mechanisms, or deliberate strategies; and in terms of moral judgements or the need to consider underlying motivations for specific behaviors or conflicts. The vulnerabilities of a client, and indeed therapist, may become lost behind actual or apparent strength and resilience. It is commonly stated that there is always a need to maintain appropriate professional personal boundaries, while allowing for emotional expression and therapeutic relationships. However, there can be difficulty acknowledging the different worlds and understandings that client and therapist may live with. A therapist may assume that the kinds of relationships and ways of interacting that make them feel safe and comfortable, have the same effect on clients. As an example at one extreme, people who may in their lives have been used to hostility, deceptiveness, rejection, aggression or abuse, may in some cases be made confused, intimidated or suspicious by presentations of warmth, intimacy or positivity. On the other hand, reassurance, openness and clear communication are usually helpful and needed. It can take several months of sessions, and perhaps several stops and starts, to begin to develop a trusting relationship that can meaningfully address issues.
History.
Personality disorder is a term with a distinctly modern meaning, owing in part to its clinical usage and the institutional character of modern psychiatry. The currently accepted meaning must be understood in the context of historical changing classification systems such as DSM-IV and its predecessors. Although highly anachronistic, and ignoring radical differences in the character of subjectivity and social relations, some have suggested similarities to other concepts going back to at least the ancient Greeks. For example, the Greek philosopher Theophrastus described 29 'character' types that he saw as deviations from the norm, and similar views have been found in Asian, Arabic and Celtic cultures. A long-standing influence in the Western world was Galen's concept of personality types which he linked to the four humours proposed by Hippocrates.
Such views lasted into the 18th century, when experiments began to question the supposed biologically based humours and 'temperaments'. Psychological concepts of character and 'self' became widespread. In the 19th century, 'personality' referred to a person's conscious awareness of their behavior, a disorder of which could be linked to altered states such as dissociation. This sense of the term has been compared to the use of the term 'multiple personality disorder' in the first versions of the DSM.
Physicians in the early 19th century started to diagnose forms of insanity that involved disturbed emotions and behaviors but seemingly without significant intellectual impairment or delusions or hallucinations. Philippe Pinel referred to this as 'manie sans délire' – insanity without delusion – and described a number of cases mainly involving excessive or inexplicable anger or rage. James Cowles Prichard advanced a similar concept he called moral insanity, which would be used to diagnose patients for some decades. 'Moral' in this sense referred to affect (emotion or mood) rather than necessarily ethics, but it was arguably based in part on religious, social and moral beliefs, with a pessimism about medical intervention so that social control should take precedence. These categories were much different and broader than later definitions of personality disorder, while also being developed by some into a more specific meaning of moral degeneracy akin to later ideas about 'psychopaths'. Separately, Richard von Krafft-Ebing popularized the terms sadism and masochism, as well as homosexuality, as psychiatric issues.
The German psychiatrist Koch sought to make the moral insanity concept more scientific, suggesting in 1891 the phrase 'psychopathic inferiority', theorized to be a congenital disorder. This referred to continual and rigid patterns of misconduct or dysfunction in the absence of apparent mental retardation or illness, supposedly without a moral judgement. Described as deeply rooted in his Christian faith, his work has been described as a fundamental text on personality disorders that is still of use today.
20th century.
In the early 20th century, another German psychiatrist, Emil Kraepelin, included a chapter on psychopathic inferiority in his influential work on clinical psychiatry for students and physicians. He suggested six types – excitable, unstable, eccentric, liar, swindler and quarrelsome. The categories were essentially defined by the most disordered criminal offenders observed, distinguished between criminals by impulse, professional criminals, and morbid vagabonds who wandered through life. Kraepelin also described three paranoid (meaning then delusional) disorders, resembling later concepts of schizophrenia, delusional disorder and paranoid personality disorder. A diagnostic term for the latter concept would be included in the DSM from 1952, and from 1980 the DSM would also include schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders; interpretations of earlier (1921) theories of Ernst Kretschmer led to a distinction between these and another type later included in the DSM, avoidant personality disorder.
In 1933 Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Borisovich Gannushkin published his book "Manifestations of psychopathies: statics, dynamics, systematic aspects", which was one of the first attempts to develop a detailed typology of psychopathies. Regarding maladaptation, ubiquity, and stability as the three main symptoms of behavioral pathology, he distinguished 9 clusters of psychopaths: cycloids (including constitutionally depressive, constitutionally excitable, cyclothymics, and emotionally labile), asthenics (including psychasthenics), schizoids (including dreamers), paranoiacs (including fanatics), epileptoids, hysterical personalities (including pathological liars), unstable psychopaths, antisocial psychopaths, and constitutionally stupid. Some elements of Gannushkin's typology were later incorporated into the theory developed by a Russian adolescent psychiatrist, Andrey Yevgenyevich Lichko, who was also interested in psychopathies along with their milder forms, the so-called accentuations of character.
Psychiatrist David Henderson published in 1939 a theory of 'psychopathic states' which ended up contributing to the term becoming popularly linked to anti-social behavior. Hervey M. Cleckley’s 1941 text, The Mask of Sanity, based on his personal categorization of similarities he noted in some prisoners, marked the start of the modern clinical conception of psychopathy and its popularist usage.
Towards the mid 20th century, psychoanalytic theories were coming to the fore based on work from the turn of the century being popularized by Sigmund Freud and others. This included the concept of 'character disorders', which were seen as enduring problems linked not to specific symptoms but to pervasive internal conflicts or derailments of normal childhood development. These were typically understood as weaknesses of character or willful deviance, and were distinguished from neurosis or psychosis. The term 'borderline' stems from a belief that some individuals were functioning on the edge of those two categories, and a number of the other personality disorder categories were also heavily influenced by this approach, including dependent, obsessive-compulsive and histrionic, the latter starting off as a conversion symptom of hysteria particularly associated with women, then a hysterical personality, then renamed histrionic personality disorder in later versions of the DSM. A passive aggressive style was defined clinically by Colonel William Menninger during World War II in the context of men's reactions to military compliance, which would later be referenced as a personality disorder in the DSM. Otto Kernberg was influential with regard to the concepts of the borderline and narcissistic personalities which were later incorporated as disorders into the DSM in 1980.
Meanwhile, a more general personality psychology had been developing in academia and to some extent clinically. Gordon Allport was publishing theories of personality traits from the 1920s, and Henry Murray advanced a theory called 'personology' which influenced a later key advocate of personality disorders, Theodore Millon. Tests were developing or being applied for personality evaluation, including projective tests such as the Rorshach, as well as questionnaires such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Around mid-century, Hans Eysenck was analysing traits and personality types, and psychiatrist Kurt Schneider was popularising a clinical use in place of the previously more usual terms 'character', 'temperament' or 'constitution'.
American psychiatrists officially recognised concepts of enduring personality disturbances in the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in the 1950s, which relied heavily on psychoanalytic concepts. Somewhat more neutral language was employed in the DSM-II in 1968, though the terms and descriptions had only a slight resemblance to current definitions. The DSM-III published in 1980 made some major changes, notably putting all personality disorders onto a second separate 'axis' along with mental retardation, intended to signify more enduring patterns, distinct from what were considered axis one mental disorders. 'Inadequate' and 'asthenic' personality disorder' categories were deleted, and others were unpacked into more types, or changed from being personality disorders to regular disorders. Sociopathic personality disorder, which had been the term for psychopathy, was renamed Antisocial Personality Disorder. Most categories were given more specific 'operationalized' definitions, with standard criteria that psychiatrists could agree on in order to conduct research and diagnose patients. In the DSM-III revision, self-defeating personality disorder and sadistic personality disorder were included as provisional diagnoses requiring further study. They were dropped in the DSM-IV, though a proposed 'depressive personality disorder' was added; in addition, the official diagnosis of passive-aggressive personality disorder was dropped, tentatively renamed 'negativistic personality disorder.'
International differences have been noted in how attitudes have developed towards the diagnosis of personality disorder. Kurt Schneider had argued that they were simply 'abnormal varieties of psychic life' and therefore not necessarily the domain of psychiatry, a view said to still have influence in Germany today. British psychiatrists have also been reluctant to address such disorders or consider them on a par with other mental disorders, which has been attributed partly to resource pressures within the National Health Service, as well as to negative medical attitudes towards behaviors associated with personality disorders. In the US, the prevailing healthcare system and psychanalytic tradition has been said to provide a rationale for private therapists to diagnose some personality disorders more broadly and provide ongoing treatment for them.
Children.
Early stages and preliminary forms of personality disorders need a multi-dimensional and early treatment approach. Personality development disorder is considered to be a childhood risk factor or early stage of a later personality disorder in adulthood.
In addition, in Robert F. Krueger's review of their research indicates that some children and adolescents do suffer from clinically significant syndromes that resemble adult personal disorders, and that these syndromes have meaningful correlates and are consequential. Much of this research has been framed by the adult personality disorder constructs from Axis II of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Hence, they are less likely to encounter the first risk they described at the outset of their review: clinicians and researchers are not simply avoiding use of the PD construct in youth. However, they may encounter the second risk they described: under-appreciation of the developmental context in which these syndromes occur. That is, although PD constructs show continuity over time, they are probabilistic predictors; not all youths who exhibit PD symptomatology become adult PD cases.
Five Factor Model.
As of 2002, there were over fifty published studies relating the Five Factor Model (FFM) to personality disorders. Since that time, quite a number of additional studies have expanded on this research base and provided further empirical support for understanding the DSM personality disorders in terms of the FFM domains.
In her seminal review of the personality disorder literature published in 2007, Dr. Lee Anna Clark asserted that "the five-factor model of personality is widely accepted as representing the higher-order structure of both normal and abnormal personality traits".
The Five Factor Model has been shown to significantly predict all ten personality disorder symptoms and outperform the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in the prediction of borderline, avoidant, and dependent personality disorder symptoms.
Research results examining the relationships between the FFM and each of the ten DSM personality disorder diagnostic categories are widely available. For example, in a study published in 2003 titled "The five-factor model and personality disorder empirical literature: A meta-analytic review", the authors analyzed data from 15 other studies to determine how personality disorders are different and similar, respectively, with regard to underlying personality traits. In terms of how personality disorders differ, the results showed that each disorder displays a FFM profile that is meaningful and predictable given its unique diagnostic criteria. With regard to their similarities, the findings revealed that the most prominent and consistent personality dimensions underlying a large number of the personality disorders are positive associations with neuroticism and negative associations with agreeableness.
Openness to experience.
At least three aspects of openness to experience are relevant to understanding personality disorders: cognitive distortions, lack of insight and impulsivity. Problems related to high openness that can cause problems with social or professional functioning are excessive fantasising, peculiar thinking, diffuse identity, unstable goals and nonconformity with the demands of the society.
High openness is characteristic to schizotypal personality disorder (odd and fragmented thinking), narcissistic personality disorder (excessive self-valuation) and paranoid personality disorder (sensitivity to external hostility). Lack of insight (shows low openness) is characteristic to all personality disorders and could explain the persistence of maladaptive behavioral patterns.
The problems associated with low openness are difficulties adapting to change, low tolerance for different worldview or lifestyles, emotional flattening, alexithymia and a narrow range of interests. Rigidity is the most obvious aspect of (low) openness among personality disorders and that shows lack of knowledge of one's emotional experiences. It is most characteristic of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, the opposite of it known as impulsivity (here: an aspect of openness that shows a tendency to behave unusually or autistically) is characteristic of schizotypal and borderline personality disorders.

Eliot Spitzer

Eliot Laurence Spitzer (born June 10, 1959) is an American lawyer, political commentator, and Democratic Party politician who served as the 54th Governor of New York from January 2007 until his resignation on March 17, 2008.
Service.
He most recently ran as a candidate for New York City Comptroller, losing the Democratic nomination to Scott Stringer. He served as the 54th Governor of New York from January 2007 until his resignation on March 17, 2008, which occurred in the aftermath of a prostitution scandal. Prior to being elected governor, Spitzer served as New York State Attorney General. After serving as Governor, he became a political commentator, and was most recently the host of "Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer", a nightly news and commentary program on Current TV, which he later left. Prior to "Viewpoint", he was the co-host of "In the Arena"—a talk-show and punditry forum broadcast on CNN—from October 2010 to July 2011.
History.
He grew up in the Bronx, New York, as the third and youngest child of real estate tycoon Bernard Spitzer and Anne Goldhaber, both Austrian Jewish immigrants in New York. He attended Princeton University for undergraduate studies and then Harvard Law School for his Juris Doctor. It was there that he met his future wife, Silda Wall. He went on to work for the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and subsequently the Manhattan District Attorney's office to pursue organized crime. He launched the investigation that brought down the Gambino crime family's control over Manhattan's garment and trucking industries. In 1994, Spitzer left to work at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and, later, Constantine and Partners.
In the 1998 election, Spitzer defeated incumbent Republican Dennis Vacco by a slim margin to become New York State Attorney General. His campaign was financed by a controversial multi-million dollar loan from his father. As attorney general, Spitzer prosecuted cases relating to corporate white collar crime, securities fraud, internet fraud and environmental protection. He pursued cases against computer chip price fixing, investment bank stock price inflation, predatory lending practices by mortgage lenders, fraud at American International Group, and the 2003 mutual fund scandal. He also sued Richard Grasso, the former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, over a compensation package perceived to be excessive.
In 2007, Spitzer was inaugurated Governor of New York after defeating Republican John Faso. During his time in office, he proposed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in New York and issued an executive order allowing undocumented immigrants to be issued driver's licenses; both attracted controversy. In July 2007, he was admonished for his administration's involvement in ordering the New York State Police to record the whereabouts of State Senate majority leader Joseph L. Bruno. On March 10, 2008, it was reported that Spitzer was a client of Emperors Club VIP. The scandal prompted him to resign as Governor on March 17.
On July 7, 2013, Spitzer announced he would be running for New York City Comptroller, adding he was, "hopeful there will be forgiveness. I am asking for it." On September 10, 2013, Spitzer lost the Democratic primary to Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer.
Early life and education.
Spitzer was born on June 10, 1959, in the Bronx, the son of Anne (née Goldhaber), an English literature professor, and Bernard Spitzer, a real estate mogul. His paternal grandparents were Galician Jews, born in Tluste, Poland (now Ukraine). His maternal grandparents, born in the 1890s, were Jewish immigrants from Palestine. Spitzer is the youngest of three children. He was raised in the affluent Riverdale section of The Bronx in New York City. His family was not particularly religious, and Spitzer did not have a Bar Mitzvah.
He is a 1977 graduate of Horace Mann School. After scoring 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), Spitzer attended Princeton University and majored in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. At Princeton, he was elected chairman of the undergraduate student government, and graduated in 1981. He claims he received a perfect score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), and went on to attend Harvard Law School, where he met and married Silda Wall. Spitzer was an editor of the "Harvard Law Review".
Legal career.
Upon receiving his Juris Doctor, Spitzer clerked for Judge Robert W. Sweet in Manhattan, then joined the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. He stayed there for less than two years before leaving to join the New York County District Attorney's office.
Spitzer joined the staff of Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, where he became chief of the labor-racketeering unit, spending six years pursuing organized crime. His biggest case came in 1992, when Spitzer led the investigation that ended the Gambino crime family's organized crime control of Manhattan's trucking and garment industries.
Spitzer devised a plan to set up his own sweatshop in the city's garment district, turning out shirts, pants and sweaters, and hiring 30 laborers. The shop manager eventually got close to the Gambinos, and officials were able to plant a bug in their office. The Gambinos, rather than being charged with extortion – which was hard to prove – were charged with antitrust violations. Joseph and Thomas Gambino, the latter being an extremely high-ranking member, and two other defendants took the deal and avoided jail by pleading guilty, paying $12 million in fines and agreeing to stay out of the business.
Spitzer left the District Attorney's office in 1992 to work at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. From 1994 to 1998 he worked at the law firm Constantine and Partners on a number of consumer rights and antitrust cases.
New York Attorney General.
Elections.
Long-serving Democratic New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams decided to resign after he failed to defeat Republican U.S. Senator Al D'Amato in 1992. The New York State Legislature elected Assemblyman G. Oliver Koppell to serve the remainder of the term in 1993. Thirty-four-year old Spitzer decided to run as well as Koppell, Brooklyn Family Court Judge Karen Burstein, and Kings County DA Charles J. Hynes. At the time, Spitzer was a young and unknown white collar attorney. On May 5, when he announced he would run, he ran for using the state's antitrust laws to go after corporate polluters. Spitzer was the only candidate to support the death penalty. In the debate, he was criticized for spending $3 million of his own money. Despite heavy funding from his own family, he placed last among four candidates for the nomination, receiving just 19% of the vote. Bernstein, the only woman and gay candidate, won the primary with 31% of vote. Burstein subsequently lost to Republican Dennis Vacco in the general election, part of a nationwide Republican sweep, that included the election of Governor George Pataki.
That election of a Republican in 1994 allowed Spitzer to run again in 1998. On May 6, 1998 he announced he would run for the office again. On May 28, he emerged as the front-runner in the race, ranking first at the convention with 36% of the vote. He also had the most amount of money, with over $2 million. In September, he won the Democratic primary election with 42% of the vote. He defeated State Senator Catherine Abate (27%), Koppell (22%), and former Governor's Counsel Evan Davis (9%).
In late October, he conceded that his father lent him most of the money he raised. He financed both campaigns from two sets of loans: $4.3 million in 1994 and $4.8 million in 1998, both from J.P. Morgan & Company. Spitzer stated "I have worked long, long hours for my dad and for various businesses. Look, I'm not saying that I am underpaid. But any effort to challenge the propriety of that fee is way off base." On October 28, the New York Times endorsed Spitzer saying both candidates were flawed but "Vacco's performance and his key policy positions make him an even worse choice. In only four years Mr. Vacco has turned an important office with a distinguished public-service tradition into a patronage mill known for taking suspect contributions and for his mixed record on such key issues as women's right to abortion." They also said "Spitzer has promised a politically moderate approach that puts the public interest ahead of rigid philosophy and special-interest contributors." In November, Spitzer went on to defeat Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco by a small margin of victory of 0.6%. Spitzer didn't win a single county in the upstate. Amazingly, he won just 6 counties in the state: New York (81%), Bronx (80%), Kings (75%), Queens (67%), Westchester (52%), and Rockland (48%).
He ran for re-election to a second term in 2002. Spitzer defeated Republican Judge Dora Irizarry 66%–30%.
Tenure overview.
As Attorney General, Spitzer stepped up the profile of the office. Traditionally, state attorneys general have pursued consumer rights cases, concentrating on local fraud while deferring national issues to the federal government. Breaking with this traditional deference, Spitzer took up civil actions and criminal prosecutions relating to corporate white-collar crime, securities fraud, Internet fraud, and environmental protection. The New York Attorney General's office has Wall Street (and thus many leading corporate and financial institutions) within its jurisdiction. Also, the New York Attorney General wields greater than usual powers of investigation and prosecution of corporations under New York State's General Business Law. In particular, under the Martin Act of 1921, the New York Attorney General has the power to subpoena witnesses and company documents pertaining to investigations of fraud or illegal activity by a corporation. Spitzer used this statute to allow his office to prosecute cases which have been described as within federal jurisdiction. Spitzer used this authority in his civil actions against corporations and criminal prosecutions against their officers. It proved useful in the wake of several U.S. corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron in 2001. Several of these corporations, as well as the brokerage houses that sold their stock, were accused of having inflated stock values by unethical means throughout the 1990s. When inquiries into these allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Congress failed, Spitzer's office used its subpoena power to obtain corporate documents, building cases against the firms both in courtrooms and in public opinion.
Under his watch, Spitzer also commissioned a 1999 study of the NYPD's stop-and-frisk practices.
In 2004, "The Nation" endorsed Spitzer as a possible Democratic candidate for vice president, stating that he was "the single most effective battler against corporate abuses in either political party". He was, however, not chosen.
In January 2005, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce described Spitzer's approach as "the most egregious and unacceptable form of intimidation we've seen in this country in modern times".
Notable cases.
In addition to prosecutions and civil actions in the financial sector, Spitzer has pursued cases in both state and federal courts involving pollution, entertainment, technology, prostitution, corruption, occupational safety and health and other fields in which New York plays a part in setting and maintaining national standards of conduct.
Loan investigation controversy.
The New York State Senate Investigations committee is considering investigating a controversial multi-million dollar loan the governor's father Bernard Spitzer gave him when he ran for attorney general in 1998, a loan the younger Spitzer has paid back. Senate Investigations Committee chairman George Winner told the "New York Post" that subpoenas should be used to find out about the loans. Winner wrote to Senate Elections Committee chairman Senator Joseph Griffo that an article profiling Spitzer in "New York" magazine "outlined what may have been a willful effort by Eliot Spitzer and his father to circumvent campaign-contribution limits in New York state law and then conceal their actions." In 1998, Spitzer claimed that he secured the $5 million loan by mortgaging apartments his father had given him, but later revealed that his father was paying off the loans and, therefore, financing his campaign.
2006 election for Governor.
On December 8, 2004, Spitzer announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination for governor of New York. While long rumored, Spitzer's announcement was unusually early—nearly two years before the election. As a result of Spitzer's relative speed in bringing state Democrats to his side, he gained the respect of Democratic leaders nationwide. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson dubbed Spitzer the "future of the Democratic Party" at a fund raiser held in June 2005 for Spitzer's gubernatorial campaign.
In January 2006, Spitzer selected New York State Senate minority leader David Paterson as his choice for Lieutenant Governor and running mate. After announcing his candidacy, Spitzer was endorsed by numerous New Yorkers, including state Comptroller Alan Hevesi and two former New York City mayors, David Dinkins and Ed Koch. On May 30, 2006, Spitzer and Paterson won the endorsement of the New York State Democratic party. A June 2006 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showed him leading Nassau county executive Thomas Suozzi 76–13 percent. On July 25, 2006, he faced Suozzi in a gubernatorial debate held at Pace University in Manhattan, discussing issues such as public authorities and Medicaid. When asked about marijuana, Spitzer stated that he disagrees with medicinal use of the drug, claiming that other medicines were more effective. In the Democratic primary held on September 12, 2006, Spitzer handily defeated Suozzi, securing his party's nomination with 81 percent of the vote.
On October 5, Spitzer, addressing the Empire State Pride Agenda, declared that as governor he would work to legalize gay marriage in New York.
Spitzer was elected Governor on November 7, 2006, with 69 percent of the vote, defeating Republican John Faso and Libertarian John Clifton, among others.
Governorship.
At the traditional midnight ceremony, Spitzer was sworn in as governor of New York on January 1, 2007. A public ceremony was held at 1 p.m. on the same day which featured brass and percussion players from the Empire State Youth Orchestra Bucking tradition, the ceremony was held outdoors – the first outdoor inauguration ceremony in New York for over a century. After taking the oath of office, he attended a concert at the Times Union Center in his honor, headlined by James Taylor and Natalie Merchant.
Roadblocks to reform.
Spitzer's reform-based platform, and his pledge "to change the ethics of Albany", hit an early roadblock when his ideas on how to fill vacancies in the executive department were defeated by the state legislature. According to the New York State Constitution, it is the duty of the state legislature to fill executive vacancies. The governor was criticized as unreasonable for admonishing the legislature when it took constitutional actions. The appointment of state assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli to succeed the disgraced Alan Hevesi as New York State Comptroller was a serious blow to the new governor. Spitzer had backed an outside panel to draft a list of qualified candidates; the legislature resisted Spitzer's desires when these included no legislators. Some Assembly Democrats were alienated over the incident, and questioned Spitzer's refusal of extending patronage to party members seeking local political appointments.
Spitzer's choice was New York City Finance Commissioner Martha Stark, who was selected by a panel that consisted of former State Comptroller Edward Regan, former State Comptroller Carl McCall and former New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin. On February 7, 2007, when the Legislature voted, Stark was one of two names put into nomination, along with Assemblyman Thomas DiNapoli of Long Island, Assembly Leader Sheldon Silver's choice. The final vote was 150 for DiNapoli and 56 for Stark. Stark's main support came from Democrats in the Senate, along with Republicans in both chambers.
Spitzer traveled to the home districts of Democratic assemblymen William B. Magnarelli and George S. Latimer (in Syracuse and Westchester County respectively), and publicly criticized them for their votes on DiNapoli; he had plans to exert similar pressure on other of his party's legislators.
One of Spitzer's key campaign pledges was to reform the state budget process. While the state did pass a budget on schedule in 2007, the ultimate results fell short of what many reformers hoped Spitzer would achieve. The "New York Post" opined, "Spitzer promised reform, and delivered something completely different" and termed the budget itself "bitterly disappointing."
Spitzer's budget quickly turned into a deficit, as by the end of October it was projected the state would run a deficit exceeding $4 billion for the year. During Spitzer's first year the state payroll increased, aggravating budget problem. Despite increasing the public sector payroll, in late 2007 New York State started leading the nation in lost jobs. The 2008–09 budget includes measures to counter financial effects of the crisis in the financial sector starting in the second half of 2007.
Spitzer was criticized by members of the New York State Legislature for failing to compromise on issues during his first few months as governor. In one exchange, according to the "New York Post", Spitzer told New York State Assembly Minority Leader James Tedisco: "Listen, I'm a f - - -king "sic" on "Post" website steamroller and I'll roll over you and anybody else", although they reported that neither party had provided the confirmation the "Post" sought. Spitzer's reputation as a "steamroller" was shared by a plurality of New Yorkers in a Quinnipiac University poll, but by a 3 to 1 margin they believed the tactic had been unsuccessful and had only added to political gridlock.
Tedisco later accused Spitzer of cutting $300,000 of state funding for health care and education grants in the Schenectady area as retaliation for Tedisco's opposition to the Spitzer plan to allow illegal immigrants New York State driver's licenses. Tedisco accused the Governor of "dirty tricks" and "bullying".
In the wake of the controversy involving the political surveillance controversy involving Bruno, Spitzer was accused of pandering to special interest groups to solidify his base of support. "The governor who took office vowing to clean up Albany has lost so much public support that he is reduced to feathering the nest of the unions and other liberals", wrote Michael Goodwin of the "Daily News".
In February 2008, "The Washington Post" published an op-ed written by Spitzer in which he criticized the Bush Administration for inhibiting States from pursuing predatory lenders.
Proposal to legalize same-sex marriage.
In April 2007, Spitzer proposed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in New York. State Senate Majority Leader Joe Bruno announced his opposition to the proposal. This legislation passed in the State Assembly on June 19, 2007, but was denied in the State Senate and was returned to the Assembly.
Controversy over use of State Police for surveillance.
On July 23, 2007, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office admonished the Spitzer administration for ordering the State Police to keep special records of Senate majority leader Joseph Bruno's whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in New York City.
A 57-page report issued by the Attorney General's office concluded that Spitzer engaged in creating media coverage concerning Senator Bruno's travel. The investigation looked into both Bruno's travel and the Senate leader's allegation that Spitzer used State Police to spy on him. Cuomo concluded that "These e-mails show that persons in the governor's office did not merely produce records under a Freedom of Information Law request, but were instead engaged in planning and producing media coverage concerning Senator Bruno's travel on state aircraft before any FOIL request was made." It also suggests that the governor's staff lied when they tried to explain what they had done and forced the State Police to go far beyond their normal procedures in documenting Bruno's whereabouts.
The report cleared Bruno of any misuse of the state's air fleet, which had been alleged. The report criticized Spitzer's office for using State Police resources to gather information about Bruno's travel and releasing the information to the media. The findings of the report were endorsed by Spitzer's own Inspector General, Kristine Hamann.
Spitzer responded at a July 23 press conference that "As governor, I am accountable for what goes on in the executive branch and I accept responsibility for the actions of my office" and that his administration had "grossly mishandled" the situation. Spitzer subsequently announced that he would indefinitely suspend his communications director, Darren Dopp, and reassign another top official. When questioned about his promise to bring ethical responsibility to state politics, Spitzer responded by saying "I will not tolerate this behavior", "ethics and accountability must and will remain rigorous in my administration," and that "I have always stated that I want ethics and integrity to be the hallmarks of my administration. That is why I requested that the State Inspector General review the allegations with respect to my office, and that is why we have fully cooperated with both inquiries."
The investigations of the event, dubbed "Troopergate" by media outlets, have not been affected by Spitzer's resignation. As of March 2008, four probes by the state Attorney General's office, the State Senate Investigations Committee, the Albany County District Attorney's Office, and the New York Commission on Public Integrity are ongoing.
Controversy over driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.
On September 21, 2007, Spitzer issued an executive order directing that state offices allow undocumented immigrants to be issued driver's licenses effective December 2007. Applicants for driver's licenses would not be required to prove legal immigration status and would be allowed to present a foreign passport as identification. After meeting with the Department of Homeland Security in October 2007, Spitzer altered the plan so that licenses issued to migrant workers would look different from other licenses and that the new licenses would not allow access to airplanes and federal buildings.
On October 21, 2007, the State Senate voted to oppose the Spitzer plan by a 39–19 vote. Eight Democrats from moderate districts broke with Spitzer on the vote. After the vote, "The New York Times" called this issue "Mr. Spitzer's single most unpopular decision since he took office."
Following the State Senate's vote, Spitzer revised his plan again, proposing the issuance of a third type of driver's license. This driver's license would be available only to United States citizens who are New York State residents, and would be valid for crossing the Canadian border. Spitzer also announced that the expiration dates of temporary visas would be printed on the driver's licenses of individuals living in the country with them.
On November 14, the day following the release of a poll showing the proposal as extremely unpopular with voters, Spitzer announced he would withdraw the plan, acknowledging that it would never be implemented. The decision drew derision from the press, as the Associated Press termed this reversal a "surrender." WCBS-TV labeled him "Governor Flip-Flop." State Senator Rubén Díaz of the Bronx said he was "betrayed" by Spitzer's abandonment of the plan.
Approval as Governor.
As of November 13, 2007, Spitzer's approval rating as governor was 33 percent, a further decline from his 44% approval rating of October 24, 2007. A later poll showed that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would defeat Spitzer were he to seek reelection. Two polls in December 2007 showed further erosion in Spitzer's public standing.
Prostitution scandal.
On March 10, 2008, "The New York Times" reported that Spitzer had previously patronized a high-priced prostitution service called Emperors Club VIP and met for over two hours with a $1,000-an-hour call girl. This information originally came to the attention of authorities from a federal wiretap. Spitzer had at least seven or eight liaisons with women from the agency over six months, and paid more than $15,000. According to published reports, investigators believe Spitzer paid up to $80,000 for prostitutes over a period of several years while he was Attorney General, and later as Governor. Spitzer first drew the attention of federal investigators when his bank reported suspicious money transfers under the anti-money laundering provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. The resulting investigation, triggered by the belief that Spitzer may have been hiding bribe proceeds, led to the discovery of the prostitution ring.
Resignation.
In the wake of the revelations, Spitzer announced on March 12, 2008, that he would resign his post as governor at noon on March 17, 2008, amid threats of his impeachment by state lawmakers.
"I cannot allow for my private failings to disrupt the people's work," Spitzer said at a news conference in New York City. "Over the course of my public life, I have insisted – I believe correctly – that people take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning from the office of governor." Spitzer's Lieutenant Governor, David Paterson, succeeded him as governor of New York State.
Post-resignation developments.
On July 16, 2008, "The New York Times" made public that Spitzer used campaign funds to pay for two Mayflower Hotel bookings, $411.06 apiece, where he was suspected to have met with prostitutes. While it remains unclear if Spitzer stayed in the hotel on the nights he booked, "The Times" has stated that Spitzer met with prostitutes in early 2008. Spitzer declined to comment on the issue.
In November 2008, prosecutors in charge of the case announced that Spitzer would not face criminal charges for his involvement in the sex ring citing they found no evidence of misuse of public funds and therefore pressing charges would not serve the public interest. Spitzer offered an apology for his conduct saying "I appreciate the impartiality and thoroughness of the investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office, and I acknowledge and accept responsibility for the conduct it disclosed."
On May 31, 2013 Spitzer and his wife were reported to be living apart.
Post-resignation media and public appearances.
Since resigning, Spitzer has become a regular columnist for "Slate" and slowly begun a return to the limelight. Close friends have stated that Spitzer spends most of his time with his family, and regularly meets with lawyers in his father Bernard's real estate office in Manhattan. Spitzer and his wife have entered couples therapy because of Spitzer's adultery.
In September 2008, "The New York Times" reported that Spitzer was considering entering philanthropic, environmental, or pro bono legal work in an effort to improve his reputation. According to some sources, Spitzer was considering a run for Senate or Comptroller in 2010, speculation which Spitzer immediately dismissed.
Spitzer continued to make public appearances and engage in media commitments following his resignation. "The Washington Post" published a Spitzer opinion piece in November 2008 conveying his analysis of the financial crisis of 2008 and suggested remedies. Spitzer concluded the piece by saying that he hoped the Obama Administration would make the right policy choices, "although mistakes I made in my private life now prevent me from participating in these issues as I have in the past." The following month, "Slate" magazine published the first of a new series of columns by Spitzer dedicated to the economy.
In September 2009, Spitzer joined the City College of New York as an adjunct instructor of political science and is currently teaching an undergraduate course called "Law and Public Policy."
Spitzer took on various public speaking arrangements, beginning with a discussion with the New York chapter of the Entrepreneurs' Organization on June 17, 2009. He also made a number of television appearances in 2009 and 2010, including "Real Time with Bill Maher" and "Campbell Brown", as well as appearing as a substitute anchor on MSNBC. On June 24, 2010, CNN announced that Spitzer would be joining the network to host a "round-table" discussion program alongside center-right Kathleen Parker. "Parker Spitzer", compared by some media outlets to the defunct "Crossfire", replaced "Campbell Brown" in the 8:00 p.m. ET timeslot on weeknights starting in October. In February 2011, CNN announced that Parker was leaving the show, which was renamed "In the Arena" on February 28, 2011. On July 6, 2011, CNN announced it was canceling "In the Arena" and shifting "Anderson Cooper 360°" to the 8 p.m. time slot.
On March 30, 2012, Spitzer joined Current TV in the wake of Keith Olbermann's sudden firing from the network, and immediately began hosting his own program "Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer".
On August 22, 2011, "The New York Times" reported that Spitzer has been sued for a combined $90 million over an August 22, 2010 "Slate" column about Wall Street firm Marsh & McLennan by two former executives of the company, claiming that they were libeled by the column. The lawsuit by one of the executives was dismissed the following year.
On January 6, 2013, Spitzer announced that he had left both "Viewpoint" and Current TV, and that he would not be joining Current TV in its latest venture with Al Jazeera. "Moving forward, their mission will be different," he said. He also stated: "For me, journalism has been more a matter of projecting a particular approach to covering policies, to covering issues. It was a continuation of what I tried to do in government. And that doesn't fit with their vision of what they are going to do."
2013 election for NYC Comptroller.
On July 7, 2013, Spitzer announced he was running for New York City Comptroller, and would start a petition the following day. 3,750 valid signatures from registered voters from his party were required by July 11 to register for the race but Spitzer was able to submit over 27,000 signatures to the city Board of Elections before the deadline. Spitzer commented that he was asking for forgiveness, and hopeful that voters could forgive him.
Eliot Spitzer lost the primary on September 10, 2013 to Scott Stringer.
Personal life.
Silda and Eliot married on October 17, 1987, and together they have three daughters: Elyssa (born 1990), Sarabeth (born 1993), and Jenna (born 1995). At the close of 2013 Spitzer and his wife announced the end of their marriage. Spitzer is reported to have had a romantic affair with Lis Smith, a 31-year-old spokesperson for then New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio. She had been Spitzer's spokesperson during his 2013 run for comptroller.

Dyad (sociology)

In sociology a dyad (from Greek "dýo", "two") is a group of two people, the smallest possible social group. As an adjective, "dyadic" describes their interaction. 
The pair of individuals in a dyad can be linked via romantic interest, family relation, interests, work, partners in crime and so on. The relation can be based on equality, but may be based on an asymmetrical or hierarchical relationship (master-servant). 
The strength of the relationship is evaluated on the basis of time the individuals spend together, as well as on the emotional intensity of their relationship.
A dyad can be unstable because both persons must cooperate to make it work. If one of the two fails to complete their duties, the group would fall apart. Because of the significance of marriages in society, their stability is very important. For this reason marital dyads are often enforced through legal, economic, and religious laws.
Dyadic friendships refer to the most immediate and concrete level of peer interaction, which is expanded to include new forms of relationships in adolescence - most notably, romantic and sexual relationships. Already Ferdinand Tönnies treated it as a special pattern of "gemeinschaft", 1887, as "community of spirit".
Meaning.
Dyad means two things of similar kind or nature or group and dyadic communication means the inter-relationship between the two. In practice, this relationship refers to dialogic relations or face-to-face verbal communication between two people involving their mutual ideas, thought, behaviour, ideals, liking, disliking, and the queries and answers concerning life and living in nature. A sudden communication between two strangers in the street and not continued afterwards or not having lasting aftereffect on each other can not be termed as dyadic communication. Examples of dyadic communication occur between Jesus and Peter or between Socrates and Plato, where dialog is not only outward, superficial, or mechanical, but instead brings the two people into a sphere where each person influences the other.
A lasting communication of ideas between two people for long duration of time or of any intensive duration of deeper impact may be called dyadic communication.

Triad (sociology)

In sociology a triad is a group of three people. It is one of the simplest human groups that can be studied and is mostly looked at by microsociology. The study of triads, as well as dyads, was pioneered by German sociologist Georg Simmel at the end of the nineteenth century.
One common rule that has been widely observed is that in any group of three people two will tend to unite against the other one. This makes triads a far less stable arrangement than dyads. Larger groups also tend to be more stable because of the greater variety of relationships that can form in them. This is true for many different groups of people from groups of three siblings to groups of coworkers. This rule makes triads a very unstable grouping that has a high likelihood of leading to conflict. Because of this, groups of three are often avoided. For instance university roommates are almost always put in groups of two, as a room with three is far more likely to lead to conflict and unhappiness. 
An important exception is when one of the members of the group is clearly dominant. Allegiance to a dominant can create a team mentality, both from the submissives to the dominant, the dominant to the submissives, and the submissives to one another.
A store with three employees can function very well if one is clearly the boss. The other two may unite against the one, or one another for the boss' favor, but since they are far weaker this will not have much effect. In other circumstances, the shared allegiance to the dominant allows them to have a stable relationship, tiered or no. In societies where polygamy is practiced, sexual relationships often follow these rules, dependent also on societal rules.
The theory of triads among people has also been applied to countries by those studying international relations and many of the same basic principles hold. See also the theory of triangles.

The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)

"The Heat Is On" is a song written by Harold Faltermeyer and Keith Forsey and recorded by Glenn Frey, from Faltermeyer and Forsey's soundtrack of the popular 1984 film "Beverly Hills Cop".
History.
It was a major hit single in its own right, reaching number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in March 1985, behind "Can't Fight This Feeling" by REO Speedwagon. It was also quite popular internationally, reaching number two on the Australian Singles Chart in 1985 and gaining peaks of number 8 on the Canadian Singles Chart and number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. In the U.S., it is the highest charting solo single by any member of The Eagles. 
The mid-to-up-tempo recording featured a steady drumbeat, synthesizer, and guitar, with a repeated saxophone riff framing the lyrical message.
The guitar solo is played by Frey himself. 
The music video for the song received heavy MTV airplay. It showed a film editor assembling scenes for "Beverly Hills Cop" while Frey and a band played the song in the adjacent room, with action scenes from the movie then directly interspersed. Among the musicians shown in the video is saxophone player Beverly Dahlke-Smith (the actual recording being made by session horn player David Woodford), and Frey's long-time drummer Michael Huey.
The recording subsequently appeared on Frey's albums "Glenn Frey Live" (1993) and "Solo Collection" (1995) as well as on some various-artists 'top hits' collections. 
The song was ranked 784th out of 2006 songs by voting featured in the Triple M Essential 2006 Countdown.
Track listings.
7" Single
In popular culture.
"The Heat Is On" was Ottawa Senators star forward Dany Heatley's goal song. It is also the song played when the Omaha Lancers junior hockey team scores, making reference to the United States Hockey League. During the mid-to-late 1980s, it was also played at New York Mets home games following a home run by a Mets player. It is the walk-on music for English darts player Denis Ovens. 
The song's title expression has been directly used in marketing slogans, such as for Australian television operations TVW and Seven Network. It was also a slogan the St. Louis Cardinals used during their 1985 pennant drive. Most notably, it has been a theme song for the Miami Heat since the franchise's creation in 1988, and is played after home wins. 
It was also covered by Alvin and the Chipmunks in the 1985 "Alvin and the Chipmunks" episode "Every Chipmunk Tells a Story". In 2009, it was used in a political context as well, becoming the theme song for the British Columbia Liberal Party Member of the Legislative Assembly for Vancouver-Fraserview, Kash Heed. It was played at Fraserview Hall on May 12, 2009, when Heed was declared the winner over New Democratic Party of British Columbia rival Gabriel Yiu.
The song was also played during the car chase sequence in the film "30 Minutes or Less".
The song was also used in a February 2012 Coca-Cola ad campaign featuring many NASCAR drivers.
The song was the inspiration for a digital short written by then-"Saturday Night Live" veteran writer Adam McKay called "The H is O" about Glenn Frey starring Will Ferrell as Frey and Ben Stiller as a fan who tries to win a bet and pick up Frey with three lines or less. Jimmy Fallon and Horatio Sanz are also in the skit. McKay would go on to write a number of hit movies starring Ferrell, including "Anchorman" and "Talladega Nights".
In 1985, the song was in the 6th year anniversary of "Eat Bulaga!", the longest-running and top-rating noontime show on RPN 9 and hosted by Tito, Vic and Joey with Coney Reyes.

Agnostic atheism

Agnostic atheism, also called atheistic agnosticism, is a philosophical position that encompasses both atheism and agnosticism. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a belief in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a deity is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact. The agnostic atheist may be contrasted with the agnostic theist, who believes that one or more deities exist but claims that the existence or nonexistence of such is unknown or cannot be known.
History.
One of the earliest definitions of agnostic atheism is that of Robert Flint, in his Croall Lecture of 1887–1888 (published in 1903 under the title "Agnosticism").
The atheist may however be, and not unfrequently is, an agnostic. There is an agnostic atheism or atheistic agnosticism, and the combination of atheism with agnosticism which may be so named is not an uncommon one.
If a man has failed to find any good reason for believing that there is a God, it is perfectly natural and rational that he should not believe that there is a God; and if so, he is an atheist... if he goes farther, and, after an investigation into the nature and reach of human knowledge, ending in the conclusion that the existence of God is incapable of proof, cease to believe in it on the ground that he cannot know it to be true, he is an agnostic and also an atheist – an agnostic-atheist – an atheist because an agnostic... while, then, it is erroneous to identify agnosticism and atheism, it is equally erroneous so to separate them as if the one were exclusive of the other...

Forum spam

Forum spam consists of posts on Internet forums that contains related or unrelated advertisements, links to malicious websites, and abusive or otherwise unwanted information. Forum spam is usually posted onto message boards by automated spambots or manually with unscrupulous intentions with one idea in mind: to get the spam in front of readers who would not otherwise have anything to do with it intentionally.
Types of forum spam.
Forum spambots surf the web looking for guestbooks, wikis, blogs, forums and any other web forms to submit spam links to. These spambots often use OCR technology to bypass CAPTCHAs present. Some spam messages are targeted towards readers and can involve techniques of target marketing or even phishing. These automated schemes can make it more difficult for users to tell real posts from the bot generated ones. Some spam messages also simply contain tags and hyperlinks intended to boost search engine ranking rather than target human readers.
Most forum spam consists of links to external sites with the dual goals of increasing search engine visibility in highly competitive advertising domains such as weight loss, pharmaceuticals, gambling, pornography, real estate or loans, and generating more traffic for these commercial websites. Some of these links may contain code to track the spambot's identity so that if a sale goes through then the spammer behind the spambot can collect a commission.
Spam posts may contain anything from a single link to dozens of links. Text content is minimal, usually innocuous and unrelated to the forum's topic. Sometimes the posts may be made in old threads that are revived by the spammer solely for the purpose of spamming links. Posts include some text to prevent the post being caught by automated spam filters that prevent posts which consist solely of external links from being submitted.
Alternatively, the spam links are posted in the user's signature, in which case the spambot will never post. The link sits quietly in the signature field, where it is more likely to be harvested by search engine spiders than discovered by forum administrators and moderators.
Since November 2006, a very destructive forum and wiki spam attack has been propagated by inserting into comments redirect domains with an automated posting script like XRumer. These domains redirect a user to pornographic websites. If a user clicks on the image or attempts to close the Website an ActiveX codec will be downloaded as a Zlob Trojan. The spambot can often bypass many of the safeguards administrators use to reduce the amount of spam posted.
Effects of forum spam.
Spam prevention and deletions measurably increase the workload of forum administrators and moderators. The amount of time and resources spent keeping a forum spam free contributes significantly to labor cost and the skill required in the running of a public forum. Marginally profitable or smaller forums may be permanently closed by administrators.
Administrators may block the ip address of the spammer and in severe cases the whole ip range from that internet gateway provider. Thus a lack of connection from that spammers location, and neighbors will not have those resources, information, and access to the domain, or a server which house hundreds of websites, the administrators has the option to block from an entire region. Thus the spammer interferes with their communities - family and friends - internet connections and its resources that too will be blocked from.
Spam prevention.
Techniques for avoiding, removing, and mitigating forum spam include:

Earl St. John

Earl St. John (14 June 1892 – 26 February 1968) was an American film producer in overall charge of production for The Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios from 1950 to 1964. 
He was born in Baton Rogue, Louisiana, and moved to England after service in World War One. He worked in distribution and exhibition and in 1939 became personal assistant to John Davis.
He was appointed Executive Producer at the studios by Rank's Managing Director John Davis with a brief to reign in financial losses. Under his austere and autocratic control, location filming was cut back, and no film was permitted to exceed a budget of £150,000. Despite this, a number of successful productions emerged from Pinewood including "Genevieve", "Reach for the Sky" and "A Night to Remember".

Gynodioecy

Gynodioecy is a dimorphic breeding system in which male-sterile individuals ("i.e." females) coexist with hermaphroditic individuals in populations. For example, populations of "Lobelia siphilitica" and "Lobelia spicata" in Massachusetts are gynodioecious; the hermaphrodites within both populations were found to be self-compatible; and mixed mating occurred (Miller and Stanton-Geddes 2007). Consequently, reproduction in gynodioecious species might occur within the hermaphrodite ("i.e." for self-compatible hermaphrodites) or involve a hermaphrodite and a female. The genetic basis of gynodioecy involves both cytoplasmic and nuclear control (Delph et al. 2007), with ecological and genetic factors suggested to be important in regulating the frequency of females in populations.

British 18 inch torpedo

There have been a number of 18 inch torpedoes in service with the United Kingdom.
These have been used on ships of the Royal Navy and aircraft of both the Fleet Air Arm and Royal Air Force, while Royal Navy surface ships and submarines use 21 inch torpedoes.
Note that the British "18 inch" torpedoes were in diameter, beginning with the "Fiume" Whitehead torpedo of 1890.
45 cm "Fiume" (Whitehead) torpedo.
First introduced into British service in 1894.
18 inch Mark V.
Used on the River class and 1905 Tribal class destroyers.
18 inch Mark VI.
Used on Destroyers of the early 1900s.
18 inch Mark VII and VII*.
Introduced on the 1908 members of the 1905 Tribal class destroyers. Used by torpedo boats built before the First World War and destroyers. Used by RAF flying boats in the 1920s.
18 inch Mark XII.
Aircraft launched, used by Fleet Air Arm and RAF Coastal Command.
18 inch Mark XIV.
The Mark XIV was an aircraft-launched torpedo. Stocks were lost with the fall of Singapore.
18 inch Mark XVI.
Electric torpedo project not completed.
18 inch Mark 30.
An air-dropped passive acoustic homing torpedo known as "Dealer" and "Dealer B". "Dealer" did not see service use, but its successor, "Dealer B" (the Mark 30 Mod 0), was issued from June 1954. Considered very successful with approximately 1,200 being built, it served in both the Royal Navy and RAF until 1970. The Mark 30 Mod 1 had several improvements, but this program was cancelled in 1955 in favour of purchasing Mark 43 Mod 3 torpedoes from the USA.

Controversy.
Like in many previous editions of EMA, the public televote and the jury awarded conflicting scores. This caused some controversy, because the strongest televote favorite Natalija Verboten, received 0 points from the jury. Similarly, Bepop in 2003, Karmen Stavec in 2002, and Tinkara Kovač in 1999 were also televote favorites. These entries usually came 2nd, or failed to qualify for the semifinals, because the points awarded by the jury outweighed the points they received from the televotes.
The controversy resulted in the 2005 EMA scores basing solely on the results of the televote.
At Eurovision.
Slovenia performed 16th in the semi final. It finished on second last 21st place with only 5 points, failing to qualify to the Grand Finals

The Citroën DS3 is a supermini, produced by the French manufacturer Citroën since 2009 and officially launched in January 2010. This is the first car in the new DS (pronounced "déesse", which is French for "goddess") range from Citroën. It was first hinted by the concept car Citroën DS Inside. While DS branding explicitly recalls the classic Citroën DS, the DS3 bears no resemblance to the older car and shares none of its engineering quirks.
Overview.
The DS3 was named 2010 "Car of the Year" by "Top Gear Magazine".
Citroën revamped their DS3 line for the summer of 2011 with a new, limited edition model, a new color and a new decal on the roof. The new color is brun Hickory, a shade of dark brown that recently made its debut on the DS3′s bigger sibling, the DS4. One of the DS3′s strongest selling points is the ability for a customer to personalize their car when they order it by mixing and matching body and roof colors, decals, and so on. This new color helps that by bringing the total amount of available body colors to ten.
A new decorative sticker theme for the roof has also made its appearance. The theme was the one that won Citroën’s Créative Award contest and is named Flavio, after its Italian designer.
The DS3 features prominently in the video for the Pixie Lott song "What Do You Take Me For". It is the first car that has had product placement in a British music video.
Convertible.
Citroën has been presented a coach convertible based on the DS3 Cabrio at the Paris Motor Show in September 2012. Sales started in 2013.
Matière Grise edition.
Citroën announced the "Matière Grise" limited edition of 750 cars for European market. It is finished in flat grey paint with chromed mirrors, chromed door trim and chromed tail light surrounds. The roof can be ordered in either white or black and the only available wheels are 17″ alloys, also available in white and black.
Citroën DS3 Racing.
A version, the DS3 Racing, was introduced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. It is the road version of Citroën's rally specification DS3 R3. The new 0-62 mph time is 6.5 seconds and the increased top speed is .
The DS3 Racing is offered in only two colors, white with gray accents or black with orange accents including roof, wheels and interior. Besides these unique color schemes, the DS3 Racing is distinguished from other trim levels by the use of real carbon fiber on the front splitter, grill, wheel arches and rear diffuser. Additionally, carbon fiber is prominently featured on the interior.
In October 2011, Citroën announced that were planning on building a total of 2,400 DS3 Racings, significantly more than the 1,000 initially planned.
In October 2012, Citroën announced the DS3 RRC intended for use in the championships below the of the WRC: WRC-2 (formerly S-WRC), European Rally Championship (ERC), Middle East Rally Championship (MERC), some national championships and so on. Visually and internally, the two models (DS3 WRC and RRC) are different since the regulations are more restrictive on the RRC. For example, the WRC 1.6-litre turbocharged direct-injection engine has been slightly modified dropping the power from 315 bhp to 275 bhp, visually the bumper intakes are smaller and the rear spoiler complies with the S2000 standards. The other significant change concerns the brakes in tarmac configuration: the diameter of the discs has been reduced from 355 to 350mm and the water-cooling system has been removed.

Bisexuality

Bisexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior toward both males and females, and may also encompass romantic or sexual attraction to people of any gender identity or to a person irrespective of that person's biological sex or gender, which is sometimes termed "pansexuality."
The term "bisexuality" is mainly used in the context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women, and the concept is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation along with heterosexuality and homosexuality, which are each parts of the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. A bisexual identity does not necessarily equate to equal sexual attraction to both sexes; commonly, people who have a distinct but not exclusive sexual preference for one sex over the other also identify themselves as bisexual.
Bisexuality has been observed in various human societies and elsewhere in the animal kingdom throughout recorded history. The term "bisexuality", however, like the terms "hetero-" and "homosexuality", was coined in the 19th century.
Definitions.
Sexual orientation, identity, behavior.
Bisexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to males and females. The American Psychological Association states that "sexual orientation falls along a continuum. In other words, someone does not have to be exclusively homosexual or heterosexual, but can feel varying degrees of both. Sexual orientation develops across a person's lifetime–different people realize at different points in their lives that they are heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual."
Sexual attraction, behavior and identity may also be incongruent, as sexual attraction or behavior may not necessarily be consistent with identity. Some individuals identify themselves as heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual without having had any sexual experience. Others have had homosexual experiences but do not consider themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Likewise, self-identified gay or lesbian individuals may occasionally sexually interact with members of the opposite sex but do not identify as bisexual. The terms "queer", "polysexual", "heteroflexible", "homoflexible," "men who have sex with men" and "women who have sex with women" may also be used to describe sexual identity or identify sexual behavior.
Pansexuality may or may not be subsumed under bisexuality, with some sources stating that bisexuality encompasses romantic or sexual attraction to all gender identities or that it is romantic or sexual attraction to a person irrespective of that person's biological sex or gender. In this sense, the term "pansexuality" is used interchangeably with "bisexuality". The concept of pansexuality deliberately rejects the gender binary, the "notion of two genders and indeed of specific sexual orientations", as pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women.
Bisexual activist Robyn Ochs defines bisexuality as "the potential to be attracted—romantically and/or sexually—to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree."
According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006):...the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.
Bisexuality as a transitional identity has also been examined. In a longitudinal study about sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths, Rosario et al. "found evidence of both considerable consistency and change in LGB sexual identity over time". Youths who had identified as both gay/lesbian and bisexual prior to baseline were approximately three times more likely to identify as gay/lesbian than as bisexual at subsequent assessments. Of youths who had identified only as bisexual at earlier assessments, 60–70% continued to thus identify, while approximately 30–40% assumed a gay/lesbian identity over time. Rosario et al. suggested that "although there were youths who consistently self-identified as bisexual throughout the study, for other youths, a bisexual identity served as a transitional identity to a subsequent gay/lesbian identity." By contrast, a longitudinal study by Lisa M. Diamond, which followed women identifying as lesbian, bisexual, or unlabeled, found that "more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished these identities," over a ten-year period. The study also found that "bisexual/unlabeled women had stable overall distributions of same-sex/other-sex attractions." Diamond has also studied male bisexuality, noting that survey research found "...almost as many men transitioned at some point from a gay identity to a bisexual, queer or unlabeled one, as did from a bisexual identity to a gay identity."
Label accuracy.
Like people of other LGBT sexualities, bisexuals often face discrimination. In addition to the discrimination associated with homophobia, bisexuals must frequently contend with discrimination from gays, lesbians, and straight society around the word "bisexual" and bisexual identity itself. The belief that bisexuality does not exist is common, and stems from two views. In the heterosexist view, people are presumed to be attracted to the opposite sex and it is sometimes reasoned that only heterosexuality truly exists. In the monosexist view, it is believed that people cannot be bisexual unless they are equally sexually attracted to both sexes. In this view, people are either exclusively homosexual (gay/lesbian) or exclusively heterosexual (straight), closeted homosexual people who wish to appear heterosexual, or heterosexuals who are experimenting with their sexuality.
The belief that one cannot be bisexual unless equally sexually attracted to both sexes is disputed by various researchers, who have reported bisexuality to fall on a continuum, like sexuality in general. In 2005, the belief that bisexuality must involve equal sexual/romantic attraction was further perpetuated by researchers Gerulf Rieger, Meredith L. Chivers, and J. Michael Bailey, who concluded that bisexuality is extremely rare in men. This was based on results of controversial penile plethysmograph testing when viewing pornographic material involving only men and pornography involving only women. Critics state that this study works from the assumption that a man is only truly bisexual if he exhibits virtually equal genital arousal responses to pornography featuring only women and pornography featuring only men. Moreover, the assertion of Bailey that "for men arousal is orientation" was criticized by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) as a simplification which neglects to account for behavior and self-identification. Bailey's study also recruited men via advertisements in "gay oriented magazines" and an alternative paper in Chicago, using no vetting process other than a person's choice to call themselves bi in response to an ad for a paid study. Further, some researchers hold that the technique used in the study to measure genital arousal is too crude to capture the richness (erotic sensations, affection, admiration) that constitutes sexual attraction. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force called the study and "The New York Times" coverage of it flawed and biphobic.
It was reported that Bailey's study was misinterpreted and misreported. In 2008, in a new study with the same technology but different recruiting criteria and stimuli, Bailey said he found bisexual genital arousal patterns in men. In 2011, he and other researchers reported that specifically among men with a history of several romantic and sexual relationships with members of both sexes, high levels of sexual arousal were found in response to both male and female sexual imagery. The authors noted this change in recruitment strategy was an important difference, but there was not enough data to establish a protocol to attain a representative sample of bisexual-identified men. Noting these factors, they concluded, "Bisexual-identified men with bisexual arousal patterns do indeed exist, however, and they present an interesting opportunity to illuminate the development and expression of male sexual orientation." A further study found a stronger bisexual arousal pattern in bisexual-identified men, compared to heterosexual and homosexual men, but that not all such identified men exhibited such arousal patterns.
Kinsey scale.
The Kinsey scale is used to describe a person's sexual experience or response at a given time. It ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. People who rank anywhere from 2 to 4 are often considered bisexual; they are often not fully one extreme or the other. In principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered bisexual.
Prevalence.
Alfred Kinsey's 1948 work "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" found that "46% of the male population had engaged in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, or 'reacted to' persons of both sexes, in the course of their adult lives". Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term "bisexual" to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use "bisexual" in its original, biological sense as hermaphroditic, stating, "Until it is demonstrated taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."
"The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior", published in 1993, showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual and 4 percent of men and 2 percent of women considered themselves homosexual.
A 2002 survey in the United States by National Center for Health Statistics found that 1.8 percent of men ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 2.3 percent homosexual, and 3.9 percent as "something else". The same study found that 2.8 percent of women ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 1.3 percent homosexual, and 3.8 percent as "something else".
In 2007, an article in the 'Health' section of "The New York Times" stated that "1.5 percent of American women and 1.7 percent of American men identify themselves bisexual." Also in 2007, it was reported that 14.4% of young US women identified themselves as "not strictly heterosexual", with 5.6% of the men identifying as gay or bisexual.
A study in the journal "Biological Psychology" in 2011 reported that there were men who identify themselves as "bisexuals" and who were aroused by both men and women.
Studies, theories and social responses.
There is no consensus among scientists about the exact reasons that an individual develops a heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual orientation. Proposed reasons include a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors (including fraternal birth order, where the number of older brothers a boy has increases the chances of homosexuality; specific prenatal hormone exposure, where hormones play a role in determining sexual orientation as they do with sex differentiation; and prenatal stress on the mother).
The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that "sexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences." The American Psychological Association has stated that "there are probably many reasons for a person's sexual orientation and the reasons may be different for different people". It further stated that, for most people, sexual orientation is determined at an early age. The American Psychiatric Association stated: "To date there are no replicated scientific studies supporting any specific biological etiology for homosexuality. Similarly, no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse." Research into how sexual orientation may be determined by genetic or other prenatal factors plays a role in political and social debates about homosexuality, and also raises fears about genetic profiling and prenatal testing.
Sigmund Freud believed that every human being is bisexual in a very broad sense of the term, that of incorporating general aspects of both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also psychologically, with sexual attraction to both sexes being one part of this psychological bisexuality. Freud believed that in the course of sexual development the masculine side would normally become dominant in men and the feminine side in women, but that as adults everyone still has desires derived from both the masculine and the feminine sides of their natures. Freud did not claim that everyone is bisexual in the sense of feeling the same level of sexual attraction to both genders. Freud's belief in innate bisexuality was rejected by Sándor Radó and, following Rado, by many later psychoanalysts.
Human bisexuality has mainly been studied alongside homosexuality. Van Wyk and Geist argue that this is a problem for sexuality research because the few studies that have observed bisexuals separately have found that bisexuals are often different from both heterosexuals and homosexuals. Furthermore, bisexuality does not always represent a halfway point between the dichotomy. Research indicates that bisexuality is influenced by biological, cognitive and cultural variables in interaction, and this leads to different types of bisexuality.
In the current debate around influences on sexual orientation, biological explanations have been questioned by social scientists, particularly by feminists who encourage women to make conscious decisions about their life and sexuality. A difference in attitude between homosexual men and women has also been reported, with men more likely to regard their sexuality as biological, "reflecting the universal male experience in this culture, not the complexities of the lesbian world." There is also evidence that women's sexuality may be more strongly affected by cultural and contextual factors.
Camille Paglia has promoted bisexuality as an ideal. Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber made an academic case for bisexuality with her 1995 book "Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life," which argued that most people would be bisexual if not for repression and other factors such as lack of sexual opportunity.
Social factors.
In the 1940s, zoologist Alfred Kinsey was the first to create a scale to measure the continuum of sexual orientation from hetero to homosexuality. Kinsey studied human sexuality and argued that people have the capability of being hetero or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances.
From an anthropological perspective, there is large variation in the prevalence of bisexuality between different cultures. Among some tribes it appears to be non-existent while in others a universal, including the Sambia of New Guinea and other similar Melanesian cultures.
Sex drive.
Several studies comparing bisexuals with hetero- or homosexuals have indicated that bisexuals have higher rates of sexual activity, fantasy or erotic interest. Van Wyk and Geist (1984) found that male and female bisexuals had more sexual fantasy than heterosexuals. Dixon (1985) found that bisexual men had more sexual activities with women than did heterosexual men. Bisexual men masturbated more but had fewer happy marriages than heterosexuals. Bressler and Lavender (1986) found that bisexual women had more orgasms per week and they described them as stronger than those of hetero- or homosexual women. They also found that marriages with a bisexual female were happier than heterosexual unions, observed less instance of hidden infidelity, and ended in divorce less frequently. Goode and Haber (1977) found bisexual women to be sexually mature earlier, masturbate and enjoy masturbation more and to be more experienced in different types of heterosexual contact.
Recent research suggests that, for most women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men. For men, however, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex or the other, but not to both, depending on sexual orientation. Similarly for most bisexual women, high sex drive is associated with increased sexual attraction to both women and men; while for bisexual men, high sex drive is associated with increased attraction to one sex, and weakened attraction to the other.
Masculinization.
Masculinization of women and hypermasculinization of men has been a central theme in sexual orientation research. There are several studies suggesting that bisexuals have a high degree of masculinization. LaTorre and Wendenberg (1983) found differing personality characteristics for bisexual, heterosexual and homosexual women. Bisexuals were found to have fewer personal insecurities than heterosexuals and homosexuals. This finding defined bisexuals as self-assured and less likely to suffer from mental instabilities. The confidence of a secure identity consistently translated to more masculinity than other subjects. This study did not explore societal norms, prejudices, or the feminization of homosexual males.
In a research comparison, published in the "Journal of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology", women usually have a better hearing sensitivity than males, assumed by researchers as a genetic disposition connected to child bearing. Homosexual and bisexual women have been found to have a hypersensitivity to sound in comparison to heterosexual women, suggesting a genetic disposition to not tolerate high pitched tones. While heterosexual, homosexual and bisexual men have been found to exhibit similar patterns of hearing, there was a notable differential within a sub-group of males identified as hyperfeminized homosexual males who exhibited test results similar to heterosexual women.
Prenatal hormones.
The prenatal hormonal theory of sexual orientation suggests that people who are exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized brains and show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess testosterone and estrogens are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.
There is research evidence that the digit ratio of the length of the 2nd and 4th digits (index finger and ring finger) is somewhat negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively to estrogen. Studies measuring the fingers found a statistically significant skew in the 2D:4D ratio (long ring finger) towards homosexuality with an even lower ratio in bisexuals. It is suggested that exposure to high prenatal testosterone and low prenatal estrogen concentrations is one cause of homosexuality whereas exposure to very high testosterone levels may be associated with bisexuality. Because testosterone in general is important for sexual differentiation, this view offers an alternative to the suggestion that male homosexuality is genetic.
The prenatal hormonal theory suggests that a homosexual orientation results from exposure to excessive testosterone causing an over-masculinized brain. This is contradictory to another hypothesis that homosexual preferences may be due to a feminized brain in males. However, it has also been suggested that homosexuality may be due to high prenatal levels of unbound testosterone that results from a lack of receptors at particular brain sites. Therefore the brain could be feminized while other features, such as the 2D:4D ratio could be over-masculinized.
Brain structure.
Simon LeVay's (1991) examination at autopsy of 18 homosexual men, 1 bisexual man, 16 presumably heterosexual men and 6 presumably heterosexual women found that the INAH 3 nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus of homosexual men was smaller than that of heterosexual men and closer in size of heterosexual women. Although grouped with homosexuals, the INAH 3 size of the one bisexual subject was similar to that of the heterosexual men.
Chromosomes.
Some evidence supports the concept of biological precursors of bisexual orientation in genetic males. According to Money (1988), men with an extra Y chromosome are more likely to be bisexual, paraphilic and impulsive.
Evolutionary theory.
Some evolutionary psychologists have argued that same-sex attraction does not have adaptive value because it has no association with potential reproductive success. Instead, bisexuality can be due to normal variation in brain plasticity. More recently, it has been suggested that same-sex alliances may have helped males climb the social hierarchy giving access to females and reproductive opportunities. Same-sex allies could have helped females to move to the safer and resource richer center of the group, which increased their chances of raising their offspring successfully.
Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.
Also, in a 2008 study, its authors stated that "There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency." They hypothesized that "while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them." and their results suggested that "genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population."
In "Scientific American Mind", scientist Emily V. Driscoll stated that homosexual and bisexual behavior is quite common in several species and that it fosters bonding: "The more homosexuality, the more peaceful the species". The article also stated: "Unlike most humans, however, individual animals generally cannot be classified as gay or straight: an animal that engages in a same-sex flirtation or partnership does not necessarily shun heterosexual encounters. Rather, many species seem to have ingrained homosexual tendencies that are a regular part of their society. That is, there are probably no strictly gay critters, just bisexual ones. Animals don't do sexual identity. They just do sex."
History.
Ancient Greece.
Ancient Greeks did not associate sexual relations with binary labels, as modern Western society does. Men who had male lovers were not identified as homosexual, and may have had wives or other female lovers.
Ancient Greek religious texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. The subtexts varied, from the mystical to the didactic.
Spartans thought that love and erotic relationships between experienced and novice soldiers would solidify combat loyalty and unit cohesion, and encourage heroic tactics as men vied to impress their lovers. Once the younger soldiers reached maturity, the relationship was supposed to become non-sexual, but it is not clear how strictly this was followed. There was some stigma attached to young men who continued their relationships with their mentors into adulthood. For example, Aristophanes calls them "euryprôktoi", meaning "wide arses", and depicts them like women.
Ancient Rome.
It was expected and socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role. The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not gender "per se". Both women and young men were considered normal objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires only with slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the "infames". Gender did not determine whether a sexual partner was acceptable, as long as a man's enjoyment did not encroach on another's man integrity. It was immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's sex life, indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in "low sensual pleasure" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.
Social status.
Because some bisexual people do not feel that they fit into either the homosexual or the heterosexual world, and because they have a tendency to be "invisible" in public, some bisexual persons are committed to forming their own communities, culture, and political movements. Some who identify as bisexual may merge themselves into either homosexual or heterosexual society. Still, other bisexual people see this merging as enforced rather than voluntary; bisexual people can face exclusion from both homosexual and heterosexual society on coming out. Psychologist Beth Firestein states that bisexuals tend to internalize social tensions related to their choice of partners and feel pressured to label themselves as homosexuals instead of occupying the difficult middle ground where attraction to people of both sexes would defy society's value on monogamy. These social tensions and pressure may affect bisexuals' mental health, and specific therapy methods have been developed for bisexuals to address this concern.
Bisexual behaviors are also associated in popular culture with men who engage in same-sex activity while otherwise presenting as heterosexual. The majority of such men — said to be "living on the down-low" — do not self-identify as bisexual. However, this may be a cultural misperception closely related to that of other LGBT individuals who hide their actual orientation due to societal pressures, a phenomenon colloquially called ""being closeted"".
Pride symbols.
A common symbol of the bisexual community is the bisexual pride flag, which has a deep pink stripe at the top for homosexuality, a blue one on the bottom for heterosexuality, and a purple one, blended from the pink and blue, in the middle to represent bisexuality.
Another symbol with the same color scheme is a pair of overlapping pink and blue triangles, the pink triangle being a well-known symbol for the homosexual community, forming purple where they intersect.
Many homosexual and bisexual individuals have a problem with the use of the pink triangle symbol, as it was the symbol that Hitler's regime use to tag and persecute homosexuals (similar to the yellow Star of David constituted of two opposed, overlapping triangles). Therefore, a double moon symbol was devised specifically to avoid the use of triangles. The double moon symbol is common in Germany and surrounding countries. Another symbol used for bisexuality is a purple diamond, conceptually derived from the intersection of two triangles, pink and blue (respectively), placed overlapping.
Media.
Film.
Notable portrayals of bisexuality can be found throughout mainstream media in movies such as: "Black Swan", "Frida", "Showgirls", "The Pillow Book", "Alexander", "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", "Henry and June", "Chasing Amy", "Velvet Goldmine", "Kissing Jessica Stein", "The Fourth Man", "Basic Instinct", "Sunday Bloody Sunday", "Something for Everyone", "The Rules of Attraction", and "Brokeback Mountain".
Television.
United States.
The FOX television series "House" features a bisexual female doctor, Remy "Thirteen" Hadley, played by Olivia Wilde, from season four onwards. The same network had earlier aired the television series "The O.C.", which for a time featured bisexual Alex Kelly (also played by Olivia Wilde), the local rebellious hangout spot's manager, as a love interest of Marissa Cooper.
Beginning with the 2009 season, MTV's "The Real World" series featured two bisexual characters, Emily Schromm, and Mike Manning.
Canada.
The Showcase supernatural crime drama, "Lost Girl", about creatures called Fae who live secretly among humans, features a bisexual protagonist, Bo, played by Anna Silk. In the story arc she is involved in a love triangle between Dyson, a wolf-shapeshifter (played by Kris Holden-Ried), and Lauren Lewis, a human doctor (played by Zoie Palmer) in servitude to the leader of the Light Fae clan.
United Kingdom.
In the BBC TV science fiction show "Torchwood", several of the main characters appear to have fluid sexuality. Most prominent among these is Captain Jack Harkness, a pansexual who is the lead character and an otherwise conventional science fiction action hero. Within the logic of the show, where characters can also interact with alien species, producers sometimes use the term "omnisexual" to describe him. Jack's ex, Captain John Hart is also bisexual. Of his female exes, significantly at least one ex-wife and at least one woman with whom he has had a child have been indicated. Some critics draw the conclusion that the series more often shows Jack with men than women. Creator Russell T Davies says one of pitfalls of writing a bisexual character is you "fall into the trap" of "only having them sleep with men" He describes of the show's , "You'll see the full range of his appetites, in a really properly done way." The preoccupation with bisexuality has been seen by critics as complementary to other aspects of the show's themes. For heterosexual character Gwen Cooper, for whom Jack harbors romantic feelings, the new experiences she confronts at Torchwood, in the form of "affairs and homosexuality and the threat of death", connote not only the Other but a "missing side" to the Self. Under the influence of an alien pheromone, Gwen kisses a woman in Episode 2 of the series. In Episode 1, heterosexual Owen Harper kisses a man to escape a fight when he is about to take the man's girlfriend. Quiet Toshiko Sato is in love with Owen, but has also has brief romantic relationships with a female alien and a male human. British newspaper "The Sun" ran the headline "Dr Ooh gets four gay pals" prior to the first series, describing all of "Torchwood"s cast as being bisexual.
Music.
Rock musician David Bowie famously declared himself bisexual in an interview with "Melody Maker" in January 1972, a move coinciding with the first shots in his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. In a September 1976 interview with "Playboy", Bowie said, "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me." In a 1983 interview, he said it was "the biggest mistake I ever made", elaborating in 2002 he explained "I don’t think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners or be a representative of any group of people. I knew what I wanted to be, which was a songwriter and a performer [...] America is a very puritanical place, and I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do. In 1995, Jill Sobule sang about bi-curiosity in her song "I Kissed a Girl", with a video that alternated images of Sobule and a boyfriend along with images of her with a girlfriend. Another song with the same name by Katy Perry also hints at the same theme. Some activists suggest the song merely reinforces the stereotype of bisexuals experimenting and of bisexuality not being a real sexual preference. Lady Gaga has stated that she is bisexual, and has stated that her song "Poker Face" is about fantasizing about a woman while being with a man.
Ric Ocasek of The Cars said that he was bisexual in an interview in 1986, stating, "I like beautiful women. Tall, thin, beautiful women. Fat little ugly women. I like all kinds of women. I'm always attracted to the opposite sex. I'm attracted to both sexes, actually. But not only beautiful men -- I think I like weird men." Brian Molko, lead singer of Placebo is openly bisexual. In 1994, with questions still swirling about his sexuality, Michael Stipe of REM described himself as "an equal opportunity lech", and said he did not define himself as gay, straight, or bisexual, but that he was attracted to, and had relationships with, both men and women. Freddie Mercury, lead singer of the band Queen, was an also acknowledged bisexual. He had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, but also a male partner Jim Hutton, although he distanced himself from Hutton during public events.
Literature.
Virginia Woolf's "" (1928) is an early example of bisexuality in literature. The story, of a man who changes into a woman without a second thought, was based on the life of Woolf's lover Vita Sackville-West. Woolf used the gender switch to avoid the book being banned for homosexual content. The pronouns switch from male to female as Orlando's gender changes. Woolf's lack of definite pronouns allows for ambiguity and lack of emphasis on gender labels. Her 1925 book "Mrs Dalloway" focused on a bisexual man and a bisexual woman in sexually unfulfilled heterosexual marriages in later life. Following Sackille-West's death, her son Nigel Nicolson published "Portrait of a Marriage", one of her diaries recounting her affair with a woman during her marriage to Harold Nicolson. Other early examples include works of D.H. Lawrence, such as "Women in Love" (1920), and Colette's "Claudine" (1900–1903) series.
The main character in Patrick White's novel, The Twyborn Affair (1979), is bisexual. Contemporary novelist Bret Easton Ellis' novels, such as "Less Than Zero" (1985) and "The Rules of Attraction" (1987) frequently feature bisexual male characters; this "casual approach" to bisexual characters recurs throughout Ellis' work.
Webseries.
In October 2009, "A Rose By Any Other Name" was released as a "webisode" series on YouTube. Directed by bisexual rights advocate Kyle Schickner, the plot centers around a lesbian-identified woman who falls in love with a straight man and discovers she is actually bisexual.
Media stereotypes.
There tend to be negative media portrayals; references are sometimes made to stereotypes or mental disorders. In an article regarding the 2005 film "Brokeback Mountain", sex educator Amy Andre argued that in films, bisexuals are often depicted negatively:
Using a content analysis of more than 170 articles written between 2001 and 2006, sociologist Richard N. Pitt, Jr. concluded that the media pathologized black bisexual men’s behavior while either ignoring or sympathizing with white bisexual men’s similar actions. He argued that the black bisexual is often described as a "duplicitous heterosexual" man spreading the HIV/AIDS virus. Alternatively, the "Brokeback" white bisexual (when seen as bisexual at all) is often described in pitying language as a "victimized homosexual" man forced into the closet by the heterosexist society around him.
In the HBO drama "Oz", Chris Keller was a bisexual serial killer who tortured and raped various men and women. Other films in which bisexual characters conceal murderous neuroses include "Black Widow", "Blue Velvet", "Cruising", "Single White Female", and "Girl, Interrupted".
Among other animals.
Many non-human animal species exhibit bisexual behavior. Examples of mammals that display such behavior include the bonobo (formerly known as the pygmy chimpanzee), orca, and the bottlenose dolphin. Examples of birds include some species of gulls and Humboldt Penguins. Other examples of bisexual behavior occur among fish and flatworms.
Many species of animals are involved in the acts of forming sexual and non-sexual relationship bonds between the same sex; even when offered the opportunity to breed with members of the opposite sex, they pick the same sex. Some of these species are gazelles, antelope, bison, and sage grouse.
In some cases, animals will choose to engage in sexual activity with different sexes at different times in their lives, and will sometimes engage in sexual activity with different sexes at random. Same-sex sexual activity can also be seasonal in some animals, like male walruses who often engage in same-sex sexual activity with each other outside of the breeding season and will revert to heterosexual sexual activity during breeding season.

Citroën DS5

The Citroën DS5 is a compact executive car by French automaker Citroën that was launched for the European market in November 2011. It is the third model in the new premium (Luxury vehicle) sub-brand DS and runs alongside its mainstream cars. The DS5 was revealed at the 2011 Shanghai Auto Show in April 2011.
Details.
Although Peugeot and Citroën products have shared platforms and principal components since the closing decades of the twentieth century, the DS5 became in 2011 the first Citroën branded car to be assembled in Peugeot's lead European plant at Sochaux.
The DS5 mixes hatchback and estate styling resembling a shooting-brake. The styling was influenced by the C-Sportlounge concept car shown at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is long and wide, dimensions that are similar to those of the Lancia Delta. This is hardly a coincidence: the DS5 is based on the PF2 platform as 3008 is too, not on the C5 as its name would imply.
Like the original concept car, its interior is heavily aviation inspired and available with two centre consoles - one of which is located on the roof directly above the other. With a head-up display in front of the driver, the cabin is designed to resemble a jet aeroplane. Emphasising its links to aviation, and the original Citroen DS model, the carmaker recreated an old photoshoot of the car with Concorde.
Buyers are able to choose between a turbocharged petrol and two diesel engines, but the drivetrain that Citroën is focusing on is PSA's diesel-electric Hybrid4. It marries a 163 hp 2.0 HDi diesel engine with a electric motor mounted on the rear axle and sends the power to all four wheels as it is needed. Depending on trim level, this powertrain emits 99g/km or 107g/km CO2, and the car can drive on electricity alone if the battery is sufficiently charged. It is also worth noting that the DS5 will be the first Citroën with a hybrid drivetrain, and the first production car with a diesel-electric hybrid drivetrain.
A hybrid convertible Citroën DS5 was chosen by François Hollande for his investiture parade as President of France.
Reviews.
The Guardian's Martin Love reviewed the DS5 giving the car a positive review towards the design. However he also mentioned that the DS5's gearbox feels jerky. 
What Car? has reviewed the DS5 giving the car a 2 out of 5 stars complaining that it rides poorly for an executive car. The readers however gave the car 4 stars.
Top Gear reviewed the car during October 2011, they gave the DS5 a 7 out of 10, they approved the cars design.

Bad Science (book)

Bad Science is a book by Ben Goldacre, criticising mainstream media reporting on health and science issues. Published by Fourth Estate in September 2008, the book contains extended and revised versions of many of his "Guardian" columns. It has been positively reviewed by the "British Medical Journal" and the "Daily Telegraph" and has reached the Top 10 bestseller list for Amazon Books. It was shortlisted for the 2009 Samuel Johnson Prize.
Contents.
Introduction.
A brief introduction (by Goldacre) touching on subjects covered by subsequent chapters. It bemoans the widespread lack of understanding of evidence-based science.
Chapter 1: Matter.
Detoxification methods (the Aqua Detox, ear candles etc.) that can easily be shown to be bogus by simple experiments. Discusses the "detox phenomenon." Touches on purification rituals.
Chapter 2: Brain Gym.
The claims for Brain Gym, a programme of specific physical exercises that its commercial promoters claim can create new pathways in the brain. The uncritical adoption of this programme by sections of the British school system is derided.
Chapter 3: The Progenium XY Complex.
On cosmetics, and the misleading and pseudoscientific claims by their manufacturers.
Chapter 4: Homeopathy.
Homeopathy is used to prompt a discussion of the nature of scientific evidence, with reference to the placebo effect, regression to the mean, and the importance of blind testing and randomisation in the design of fair clinical trials. Having concluded that homeopathic pills have been shown to work no better than placebo pills, the author suggests homeopathy may still have psychological benefits which could be the subject of further study.
Chapter 5: The Placebo Effect.
Examples of the power of the mind over pain, anxiety and depression are presented with studies showing how higher prices, fancy packaging, theatrical procedures and a confident attitude in the doctor all contribute to the relief of symptoms. In patients with no specific diagnosed condition, even a fake diagnosis and prognosis with no other treatment helps recovery, but ethical and time constraints usually prevent doctors from giving this reassurance. Exploiting the placebo effect is presented as possibly justifiable if used in conjunction with effective conventional treatments. The author links its use by alternative medicine practitioners with the diversion of patients away from effective treatments and the undermining of public health campaigns on AIDS and malaria.
Chapter 6: The Nonsense "du Jour".
Nutritionists are accused of misusing science and mystifying diet to bamboozle the public. Misrepresentations of the results of legitimate scientific research to lend bogus authority to nutritionist theories, while ignoring alternative explanations are cited in evidence. The use of weak circumstantial associations between diet and health found in observational studies as if they proved nutritionist claims is criticised. The unjustified over-interpretation of surrogate outcomes in animal (or tissue culture) experiments as proving human health benefits is explored. The cherry picking of published research to support a favoured view is contrasted with the systematic review designed to minimise such bias. The supposed benefits of antioxidants are questioned with studies showing they may be ineffective or even harmful in some cases. The methods used by the food supplement industry to manufacture doubt about any critical scientific reports are likened to those previously used by the tobacco and asbestos industries.
Chapter 7: Dr Gillian McKeith PhD.
The Scottish TV diet guru and self-styled "doctor" Gillian McKeith and her scientific claims are dissected. Statements exemplifying her scientific knowledge include that the consumption of dark-leaved vegetables like spinach "will really oxygenate your blood" as they are high in chlorophyll, and that "each sprouting seed is packed with the nutritional energy needed to create a fully-grown, healthy plant". She is described masquerading as a genuine medical doctor on her TV reality/health shows. Her publications are compared with a Melanesian cargo cult; superficially correct but lacking any scientific substance. Her belief in the special nutritional value of plant enzymes (which are broken down in the gut like any other proteins) is ridiculed. The general problems involved in establishing any firm links between diet and health are examined.
Chapter 8: 'Pill Solves Complex Social Problem'.
The claim that fish oil capsules make children smarter is examined. The book probes the methodological weaknesses of the widely publicised "Durham trial" where the pills were given to children to improve their school performance and behaviour, but without any control groups and wide open to a range of confounding factors. The failure to publish any results and backtracking on earlier claims by the education authorities is slated. The media's preference for simple science stories and role in promoting dubious health products is highlighted. Parallels are drawn between the Equazen company behind the Durham fish oil trials and the Efamol company's promotion of evening primrose oil.
Chapter 9: Professor Patrick Holford.
The influence of the best-selling author, media commentator, businessman and founder of the Institute for Optimum Nutrition (which has trained most of the UK's "nutrition therapists") is acknowledged. Holford's success in presenting nutritionism as a scientific discipline in the media, and forging links with some British universities is also noted. The book judges that his success is based on misinterpreting and cherry-picking favourable results from the medical literature, in order to market his vitamin pills. His promotion of vitamin C in preference to AZT as a treatment for AIDS, vitamin E to prevent heart attacks, and vitamin A to treat autism are all condemned as lacking in sound evidential support. His reliance on the work of discredited fellow nutritionist Dr. R.K. Chandra is likewise slated. The Universities of Luton and Teesside are criticised for their past associations with Holford and the ION.
Chapter 10: Is Mainstream Medicine Evil?
The book remarks on the relatively low percentage of conventional medical activity (50 to 80%) which could be called "evidence-based". The efforts of the medical profession to weed out bad treatments are seen to be hampered by the withholding or distortion of evidence by drug companies. The science and economics of drug development are outlined, with criticism of the lack of independence of industrial research and the neglect of Third World diseases. Some underhand tricks used by drug companies to engineer positive trial results for their products are explored. The publication bias produced by researchers not publishing negative results is illustrated with funnel plots. Examples are made of the SSRI antidepressants and Vioxx drugs. Reform of trials registers to prevent abuses is proposed. The ethics of drug advertising and manipulation of patient advocacy groups are questioned.
Chapter 11: How the Media Promote the Public Misunderstanding of Science.
The misrepresentation of science and scientists in the media is attributed to the preponderance of humanities graduates in journalism. The dumbing-down of science to produce easily assimilated wacky, breakthrough or scare stories is criticised. Wacky "formula stories" like those for "the perfect boiled egg" or "most depressing day of the year" are revealed to be the product of PR companies using biddable academics to add weight to their marketing campaigns. Among other examples, the speculation by Dr. Oliver Curry (a political theorist at the LSE) that the human race will evolve into two separate races, presented as a science story across the British media, is exposed as a PR stunt for a men's TV channel. The relative scarcity of sensational medical breakthroughs since a golden age of discovery between 1935 and 1975, is seen as motivating the production of dumbed-down stories which trumpet unpublished research and ill-founded speculation. An inability to evaluate the soundness of scientific evidence is seen to give undeserved prominence to marginal figures with fringe views.
Chapter 12: Why Clever People Believe Stupid Things.
This chapter is a brief introduction to the research on cognitive biases, which, Goldacre argues, explain some of the appeal of alternative medicine ideas. Biases mentioned include confirmation bias, the availability heuristic, illusory superiority and the clustering illusion (the misperception of random data). It also discusses Solomon Asch's classic study of social conformity.
Chapter 13: Bad Stats.
This chapter covers the cases of Sally Clark and Lucia de Berk, in which the author says poor understanding and presentation of statistics played an important part in their criminal trials.
Chapter 14: Health Scares.
In this chapter, the author claims that the press selectively used a "laboratory" that gave positive MRSA results where other pathology labs found none. Creating an "expert" from Chris Malyszewicz who worked from a garden shed.
Goldacre notes how the Daily Mirror once managed to combine "three all-time classic bogus science stories" into one editorial: the Arpad Pusztai affair of GM crops, Andrew Wakefield and the MMR vaccine controversy and Chris Malyszewicz and the MRSA hoax. On the other hand journalists were very poor in uncovering or reporting on the thalidomide tragedy - only covering well the ultimate political issue of compensation.
Chapter 15: The Media's MMR Hoax.
Andrew Wakefield and the MMR vaccine controversy. continues to discuss the lab results in previous chapter and discusses the MRSA mix up in hospitals wrong patients get wrong results.
Index.
The hardback and first paperback editions did not include an index. Several indexes were prepared by bloggers, including one prepared by Oliblog. The latest paperback issue includes a full index.
Previously unpublished chapter: "The Doctor Will Sue You Now".
Further to the release of this book a resolution of the legal status of one of the chapters has come about since Goldacre won a libel case filed against him by Matthias Rath. The post dated 9 April 2009 states: "This is the “missing chapter” about vitamin pill salesman Matthias Rath. Sadly I was unable to write about him at the time that book was initially published, as he was suing my ass in the High Court."
The full chapter has been made universally available under a Creative Commons license with the title "The Doctor Will Sue You Now". Additionally, this full chapter is included as chapter 10 in the "New Paperback Edition".
In this chapter the author explains its origin, its reasons for being excluded and describes his personal reasons and tribulations in the said legal resolution. Being his personal point of view it contains an account of his anger at being gagged due to legal/financial restrictions, his support by the Guardian (whom he writes for) and his now encyclopedic knowledge of the subject in question.

Friderich Martens

Friderich Martens, (1635 - 1699) was a German physician and naturalist who conducted the first scientific observations of the nature, animal life and climate of Svalbard. He published his notes in the book ""Spitzbergische oder Groenlandische Reise-Beschreibung, gethan im Jahre 1671"" and this book became a reference work for many decades.
Biography.
There is very little documentation on Martens' life. He was born in 1635 and worked as an feldsher and physician in Hamburg.
In 1671 Martens joined a voyage on a whaler through the Norwegian Sea to Spitsbergen. The "Jonas im Walfisch", under captain Pieter Pieterszoon van Friesland, left Hamburg on 15 April 1671 heading north. The vessel left Spitsbergen on 22 July again reaching the Elbe on 21 August the same year. Martens made detailed notes of his observations and compiled these in his book ""Spitzbergische oder Groenlandische Reise-Beschreibung, gethan im Jahre 1671"" which was published in 1675 by Gottfried Schulzen in Hamburg. The book contains observations of the ocean and weather and descriptions of a number of arctic plants, birds and animals complete with many drawings. There are also the first notes on the Ivory Gull prior to the thorough description by Constantine Phipps and the Brünnich's Guillemot prior to the thorough description by Morten Brünnich 
Martens book was later translated into several languages and was published in Italian (1680), Dutch (1685), English (1694; as a section of a book) and French (1715; as an article).
Martens died in 1699 at the age of sixty-four.
Legacy.
The book remained a reference work for many years and was quoted among others by Constantine Phipps 1774 in ""A Voyage towards the North Pole undertaken … 1773"", Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre 1796 in ""Études de la nature"" and Bernard Germain de Lacépède 1804 in ""Histoire naturelle des cétacés"".
In 1861 Swedish explorer "Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld" named Martensøya, an island among the Sjuøyane in honor of Friderich Martens 
The National Library of Finland at the University of Helsinki keeps an original copy of a Dutch edition printed in 1710, of which a digital copy is available.
In 2002 a reprint was released in Berlin.
In 2007 El Museo del Fin del Mundo (Usuahia, Argentina) based on a 1711 copy manuscript kept in its collection, published a Spanish translation of the book.

Bengali language

Bengali or Bangla ( "" ) is the language native to the region of Bengal, which comprises present-day Bangladesh and the Indian states West Bengal, Tripura and southern Assam. It is written using the Bengali script. With about 220 million native and about 250 million total speakers, Bengali is one of the most spoken languages, ranked seventh in the world. The National Anthem of Bangladesh, National Anthem of India, National Anthem of Sri Lanka and the national song of India were first composed in the Bengali language.
Along with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali evolved circa 1000–1200 CE from eastern Middle Indo-Aryan dialects such as the Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, which developed from a dialect or group of dialects that were close, but not identical to, Vedic and Classical Sanskrit. Literary Bengali saw borrowings from Classical Sanskrit, preserving spelling while adapting pronunciation to that of Bengali, during the period of Middle Bengali and the Bengali Renaissance. The modern literary form of Bengali was developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries based on the dialect spoken in the Nadia region, a west-central Bengali dialect. Bengali presents a strong case of diglossia, with the literary and standard form differing greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language. Standard Bengali in West Bengal and Bangladesh are marked by some differences in usage, accent, and phonetics. Today, literary form and dialects of Bengali constitute the primary language spoken in Bangladesh and the second most commonly spoken language in India. Also with a rich literary tradition arising from the Bengali Renaissance, Bengali language binds together a culturally diverse region and is an important contributor to Bengali nationalism.
The Bengali Language Movement was a popular ethno-linguistic movement in the former East Bengal (today Bangladesh), which was a result of the strong linguistic consciousness of the Bengali people to gain and protect spoken and written Bengali script's recognition as a state language of the then Dominion of Pakistan. On the day of 21 February 1952 several students and political activists were killed during protests near Dhaka University campus. The day has since been observed as Language Movement Day in Bangladesh, and was proclaimed the International Mother Language Day by UNESCO on 17 November 1999 marking Bengali language the only language in the world to be also known for its language movements and people sacrificing their life for their mother language Bengali. There was a similar Bengali language movement in Assam which was a protest against the decision of the Government of Assam to make Assamese the only official language of the state even though a significant proportion of the population were Bengali speaking.
History.
Like other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali arose from eastern Middle Indo-Aryan dialects of Magadhi Prakrit and Pali. The earliest recorded spoken languages in the region and the language of Gautama Buddha, evolved into the Jain Prakrit or "ôrdhômagôdhi" "Half Magadhi" in the early part of the first millennium CE. "ôrdhômagôdhi", as with all of the Prakrits of North India, began to give way to what are called "ôpôbhrôngshô" ("Corrupted grammar") languages just before the turn of the first millennium. The local "ôpôbhrôngshô" language of the eastern subcontinent, "Purbi ôpôbhrôngshô" or Abahatta ("Meaningless Sounds"), eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups of the Assamese-Bengali languages, the Bihari languages, and the Oriya languages. Some argue that the points of divergence occurred much earlier—going back to even 500 but the language was not static: different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects. For example, Magadhi Prakrit is believed to have evolved into Abahatta around the 6th century which competed with the ancestor of Bengali for a period of time.
Usually three periods are identified in the history of Bengali language:
Bengali also saw an increase in Sanskrit influence during the Middle Bengali (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu era) and also during the Bengal Renaissance. The modern Bengali vocabulary contains the vocabulary base from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, also borrowings & reborrowings from Sanskrit and other major borrowings from Arabic, Austroasiatic languages and other languages in contact.
Until the 18th century, there was no attempt to document Bengali grammar. The first written Bengali dictionary/grammar, "Vocabolario em idioma Bengalla, e Portuguez dividido em duas partes", was written by the Portuguese missionary Manuel da Assumpção between 1734 and 1742 while he was serving in Bhawal Estate. Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, a British grammarian, wrote a modern Bengali grammar ("A Grammar of the Bengal Language (1778)") that used Bengali types in print for the first time. Ram Mohan Roy, the great Bengali reformer, also wrote a "Grammar of the Bengali Language" (1832).
During this period, the "Chôlitôbhasha" form of Bengali using simplified inflections and other changes, was emerging from "Sadhubhasha" (Proper form or original form of Bengali) as the form of choice for written Bengali.
Bengali was the focus, in 1951–52, of the Bengali Language Movement ( "Bhasha Andolôn") in what was then East Bengal (today Bangladesh). On 21 February 1952, protesting students and activists were fired upon by military and police in the University of Dhaka and three young students and several other people were killed. Later in 1999, UNESCO declared 21 February as the International Mother Language Day in recognition of the deaths and people sacrificing their life for their mother language Bengali. In a separate event on 19 May 1961, police in Barak Valley in Assam killed eleven people who were demonstrating against legislation that mandated the use of the Assamese language.
Geographical distribution.
Bengali language is native to the region Bengal, which comprises present-day nation of Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and southern Assam.
Besides the native region it is also spoken by the majority of the population in the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. There are also significant Bengali-speaking communities in Middle East, Japan, United States, Singapore, Malaysia, Maldives, Australia, Canada and United Kingdom.
Official status.
Bengali is the national and official language of Bangladesh, and one of the 23 official languages recognised by the Republic of India. It is the official language of the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam. It is also a major language in the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
Bengali is a second official language of the Indian state of Jharkhand since September 2011. It is also a recognized secondary language in the City of Karachi in Pakistan. The Department of Bengali in the University of Karachi also offers regular programs of studies at the Bachelors and at the Masters levels for Bengali Literature. In December 2002, Sierra Leone’s then 
President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah also named Bengali as an "official language" in recognition of the work of 5,300 troops from Bangladesh in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone peacekeeping force.
The national anthems of both Bangladesh and India were written in Bengali by the Bengali Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. In 2009, elected representatives in both Bangladesh and West Bengal called for Bengali language to be made an official language of the United Nations.
Dialects.
Regional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a dialect continuum. Linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterjee grouped these dialects into four large clusters—Rarh, Banga, Kamarupa and Varendra; but many alternative grouping schemes have also been proposed. The south-western dialects (Rarh or Nadia dialect) form the basis of modern standard colloquial Bengali. In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern and south-eastern Bangladesh (Barisal division, Chittagong division, Dhaka division and Sylhet division of Bangladesh), many of the stops and affricates heard in West Bengal are pronounced as fricatives. Western alveolo-palatal affricates চ [], ছ [], জ [] correspond to eastern , ছ় , . The influence of Tibeto-Burman languages on the phonology of Eastern Bengali is seen through the lack of nasalized vowels. Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma Bangla, have contrastive tone; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. Rajbangsi, Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, Hajong is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.
During the standardization of Bengali in the 19th century and early 20th century, the cultural center of Bengal was in the city of Calcutta (now Kolkata), founded by the British. What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect of Nadia District, located next to the border of Bangladesh. There are cases where speakers of Standard Bengali in West Bengal will use a different word from a speaker of Standard Bengali in Bangladesh, even though both words are of native Bengali descent. For example, the word salt is "nun" in the west which corresponds to "lôbôn" in the east.
Spoken and literary varieties.
Bengali exhibits diglossia, though largely contested notion as some scholars proposed triglossia or even n-glossia or heteroglossia between the written and spoken forms of the language. Two styles of writing, involving somewhat different vocabularies and syntax, have emerged:
While most writing is in Standard Colloquial Bengali, spoken dialects (defeated language of the captive speaker) exhibit a greater variety. South-eastern West Bengal, including Kolkata, speak in Standard Colloquial Bengali. Other parts of West Bengal and western Bangladesh speak in dialects that are minor variations, such as the Medinipur dialect characterised by some unique words and constructions. However, a majority in Bangladesh speak in dialects notably different from Standard Colloquial Bengali. Some dialects, particularly those of the Chittagong region, bear only a superficial resemblance to Standard Colloquial Bengali. The dialect in the Chittagong region is least widely understood by the general body of Bengalis. The majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one variety—often, speakers are fluent in "Cholitobhasha" (Standard Colloquial Bengali) and one or more regional dialects. For some counter-views, one may browse some different articles.
Even in Standard Colloquial Bengali, the words may differ based on the speakers's religion. Due to religious traditions Hindus and Muslims might use respectively, Sanskrit-derived and Arabic-derived words. Some examples of lexical alternation between these two forms (here S=derived from Sanskrit, A=derived from Arabic):
Phonology.
The phonemic inventory of standard Bengali consists of 29 consonants and 7 vowels, including 6 nasalized vowels. The inventory is set out below in the (upper grapheme in each box) and romanization (lower grapheme).
Bengali is known for its wide variety of diphthongs, combinations of vowels occurring within the same syllable.
Stress.
In standard Bengali, stress is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all trochaic; the primary stress falls on the initial syllable of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in "shô-hô-jo-gi-ta" "cooperation", where the boldface represents primary and secondary stress.
Consonant clusters.
Native Bengali words (তদ্ভব "tôdbhôbô") do not allow initial consonant clusters; the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e. one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as গেরাম "geram" (CV.CVC) for গ্রাম "gram" (CCVC) "village" or ইস্কুল "iskul" (VC.CVC) for স্কুল "skul" (CCVC) "school".
Writing system.
The Bengali script is an "abugida", a script with letters for consonants, diacritics for vowels, and in which an "inherent" vowel (অ "ô") is assumed for consonants if no vowel is marked. The Bengali script is used throughout Bangladesh and eastern India (Assam, West Bengal, Tripura). The Bengali script is believed to have evolved from a modified Brahmic script around 1000 CE (or 10th – 11th century). The Bengali script with minor variations is shared with Assamese script.
The Bengali script is a cursive script with eleven graphemes or signs denoting nine vowels and two diphthongs, and thirty-nine graphemes representing consonants and other modifiers. There are no distinct upper and lower case letter forms. The letters run from left to right and spaces are used to separate orthographic words. Bengali script has a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the graphemes that links them together called মাত্রা "matra".
Since the Bengali script is an abugida, its consonant graphemes usually do not represent phonetic segments, but carry an "inherent" vowel and thus are syllabic in nature. The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either as in মত "opinion" or , as in মন "mind", with variants like the more open . To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the "hôsôntô" (্), may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in ম্ ). This diacritic, however, is not common, and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a "hôsôntô", may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final ন in মন or the medial ম in গামলা ).
A consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent is orthographically realized by using a variety of vowel allographs above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel ligature. These allographs, called কার "kar" are dependent, diacritical vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph মি represents the consonant followed by the vowel , where is represented as the diacritical allograph ি (called ই-কার "i-kar") and is placed "before" the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs মা , মী , মু , মূ , মৃ , মে , মৈ , মো and মৌ represent the same consonant ম combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. It should be noted that in these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called "inherent" vowel is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign ম .
The vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in মই "ladder" and in ইলিশ "Hilsa fish", the independent form of the vowel ই is used (cf. the dependent form ি). A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realized using its independent form.
In addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing "hôsôntô", three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed "chôndrôbindu" (ঁ), denoting a suprasegmental for nasalization of vowels (as in চাঁদ "moon"), the postposed "ônusbar" (ং) indicating the velar nasal (as in বাংলা "Bengali") and the postposed "bisôrgô" (ঃ) indicating the voiceless glottal fricative (as in উঃ! "ouch!") or the gemination of the following consonant (as in দুঃখ "sorrow").
The Bengali consonant clusters (যুক্তব্যঞ্জন "juktôbênjôn") are usually realized as ligatures (যুক্তাক্ষর "juktakkhôr"), where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist a few visual formulas to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more "transparent" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognize both the new "transparent" and the old "opaque" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.
Bengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke "daŗi" (|), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar.
Unlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called মাত্রা "matra". The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter ত "tô" and the numeral ৩ "3" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the "matra", as is the case between the consonant cluster ত্র "trô" and the independent vowel এ "e". The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).
There is yet to be a uniform standard collating sequence (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.
Orthographic depth.
The Bengali script in general has a comparatively shallow orthography, i.e., in most cases there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds (phonemes) and the letters (graphemes) of Bengali. But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.
One kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit, and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters (শ, ষ, and স) for the voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative , although the letter স does retain the voiceless alveolar fricative sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in স্খলন "fall", স্পন্দন "beat", etc. The letter ষ also does retain the voiceless retroflex fricative sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in কষ্ট "suffering", গোষ্ঠী "clan", etc. Similarly, there are two letters (জ and য) for the Voiced alveolo-palatal affricate . Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal ণ is now pronounced as an alveolar when in conversation (the difference is seen heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another retroflex consonant such as ট, ঠ, ড and ঢ), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The near-open front unrounded vowel is orthographically realized by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: এত "so much", এ্যাকাডেমী "academy", অ্যামিবা "amoeba", দেখা "to see", ব্যস্ত "busy", ব্যাকরণ "grammar".
Another kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either or depending on the Vowel Harmony (স্বরসঙ্গতি) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in কম "less", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.
Many consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants ক্ and ষ is graphically realized as ক্ষ and is pronounced (as in রুক্ষ "rugged") or (as in ক্ষতি "loss") or even (as in ক্ষমতা "power"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.
For a detailed list of these inconsistencies, consult Bengali script.
Uses.
The Bengali script, with a few small modifications, is also used for writing Assamese. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali alphabet like Meitei language in the Indian state of Manipur, where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali script for centuries, though Meitei Mayek script has been promoted in recent times.
Romanization.
There are various ways of Romanization systems of Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali script has often been included with the group of Indic scripts for romanization where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the "International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" or IAST system (based on diacritics), "Indian languages Transliteration" or ITRANS (uses upper case alphabets suited for ASCII keyboards), and the National Library at Calcutta romanization.
In the context of Bengali Romanization, it is important to distinguish transliteration from transcription. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced). Since English does not have the sounds of Bengali, and since pronunciation does not completely reflect the spellings, not being faithful to both.
Although it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a phonemic transcription, where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.
Grammar.
Bengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives (inflection). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately declined (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four cases while verbs are heavily conjugated, and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.
Word order.
As a head-final language, Bengali follows subject–object–verb word order, although variations to this theme are common. Bengali makes use of postpositions, as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. Determiners follow the noun, while numerals, adjectives, and possessors precede the noun.
Yes-no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) tone of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally optional particles (e.g. কি "-ki", না "-na", etc.) are often encliticized onto the first or last word of a yes-no question.
Wh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to focus position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.
Nouns.
Nouns and pronouns are inflected for case, including nominative, objective, genitive (possessive), and locative. The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of animacy. When a definite article such as -টা "-ţa" (singular) or -গুলা "-gula" (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for number.
When counted, nouns take one of a small set of measure words. Similar to Japanese, the nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. The noun's measure word (MW) must be used between the numeral and the noun. Most nouns take the generic measure word -টা "-ţa", though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. -জন "-jôn" for humans).
Measuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. আট বিড়াল "aţ biŗal" instead of আটটা বিড়াল "aţ-ţa biŗal" "eight cats") would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. শুধু একজন থাকবে। "Shudhu êk-jôn thakbe." (lit. "Only one-MW will remain.") would be understood to mean "Only one person will remain.", given the semantic class implicit in -জন "-jôn".
In this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to mass nouns.
Verbs.
Verbs divide into two classes: finite and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for person (first, second, third), tense (present, past, future), aspect (simple, perfect, progressive), and honor (intimate, familiar, and formal), but "not" for number. Conditional, imperative, and other special inflections for mood can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.
Inflectional suffixes in the morphology of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in syntax.
Bengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the zero copula, where the copula or connective "be" is often missing in the present tense. Thus "he is a teacher" is সে শিক্ষক "se shikkhôk", (literally "he teacher").
Vocabulary.
Bengali has as many as 100,000 separate words, of which 50,000 are considered তৎসম "Tôtsômô" (direct re-borrowings from Sanskrit), 21,100 are তদ্ভব "Tôdbhôbô" (native words), and the rest being বিদেশী "bideshi" (foreign borrowings) and দেশী "deshi" (Austroasiatic borrowings) words.
However, these figures do not take into account the fact that a large proportion of these words are archaic or highly technical, minimizing their actual usage. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of তদ্ভব "Tôdbhôbô" words, while তৎসম "Tôtsômô" only make up 25% of the total. দেশী "deshi" and বিদেশী "Bideshi" words together make up the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.
Due to centuries of contact with Europeans, Mughals, Arabs, Persians, and East Asians, The Bengali language has absorbed countless words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these borrowings into the core vocabulary.
The most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. After close contact with several indigenous Austroasiatic languages, centuries of invasions from Persia and the Middle East, particularly under the Mughal Empire, numerous Turkish, Arabic, and Persian words were absorbed and fully integrated into the lexicon.
Later, East Asian travelers and lately European colonialism brought words from Portuguese, French, Dutch, and most significantly English during the colonial period.

SmartForm

In the Australian government, a SmartForm is an electronic form with capabilities beyond a traditional paper form, such as electronic completion, dynamic sections, database calls and electronic submission. The Australian government established a specialist unit called the SmartForms Developer Center to encourage and assist Government Agencies to transform their current paper forms to SmartForms. The aim of this is to improve both their own internal processing as well the service they are providing to their constituents.
In 2008, the use of SmartForms was named a best practice initiative by the Australian Government Information Management Office in the Review of the Australian Government's Use of ICT.
Use in Government.
The Federal Australian Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research coordinates SmartForms initiatives across Australian government agencies. Departments currently using SmartForms include NSW Local Government Agencies, Victorian State Government, NT State Government and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.
The Australian Department of Finance and Deregulation is promoting a Whole of Government SmartForms solution under a $42M Australian Government Online Service Point program. This SmartForm solution is based on Adobe Systems XFA forms, Livecycle and Avoka Transact.
Technologies.
There are a number technologies that can deliver SmartForm benefits with varying levels of capability. These include:

Bengali alphabet

The Bengali alphabet ( "Bangla hôrôf", "Bangla lipi") is the writing system for the Bengali language ("Bangla") and is the 6th most widely used writing system in the world. The script with minor variations is shared by Assamese and is the basis for the other languages like Meitei and Bishnupriya Manipuri. All these languages are spoken in the eastern region of South Asia. Historically, the script has also been used to write the Sanskrit language in the same region. From a classificatory point of view, the Bengali script is an abugida, i.e. its vowel graphemes are mainly realized not as independent letters, but as diacritics attached to its consonant letters. It is written from left to right and lacks distinct letter cases. It is recognizable by a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the letters that links them together which is known as "matra". The Bengali script is however less blocky and presents a more sinuous shape.
History.
The Bengali script evolved from the "Siddhông" script, which belongs to the Brahmic family of scripts. In addition to differences in how the letters are pronounced in the different languages, there are some typographical differences between the version of the script used for Assamese language and that used for Bengali language.
"Illustration:"
The Bengali script was originally not associated with any particular language, but was often used in the eastern regions of Medieval India and then in Pala Empire and later continued to be specifically used in the Bengal region. It was later standardized into the modern Bengali script by Ishwar Chandra under the reign of the British East India Company. Today the script holds official script status in Bangladesh and India, and is associated with the daily life of the Bengali people.
Standardization.
In the Bengali script, clusters of consonants are represented by different and sometimes quite irregular forms; thus, learning to read is complicated by the sheer size of the full set of letters and letter combinations, numbering about 350. While efforts at standardizing the alphabet for the Bengali language continue in such notable centres as the Bangla Academy at Dhaka (Bangladesh) and the Pôshchimbônggô Bangla Akademi at Kolkata (West Bengal, India), it is still not quite uniform as yet, as many people continue to use various archaic forms of letters, resulting in concurrent forms for the same sounds. Among the various regional variations within this script, only the Assamese and Bengali variations exist today in the formalized system.
It seems likely that the standardization of the alphabet will be greatly influenced by the need to typeset it on computers. The large alphabet can be represented, with a great deal of ingenuity, within the ASCII character set, omitting certain irregular conjuncts. Work has been underway since around 2001 to develop Unicode fonts, and it seems likely that it will split into two variants, traditional and modern. In this and other articles on Wikipedia dealing with the Bengali language, a Romanization scheme used by linguists specializing in Bengali phonology is included along with IPA transcription. A recent effort by the Government of West Bengal focused on simplifying Bengali orthography in primary school texts.
There is yet to be a uniform standard collating sequence (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.
Description of Bengali glyphs.
The glyphs of the Bengali script can be divided into vowel diacritics, consonant and vowel letters (including consonant conjuncts), modifiers, digits, and punctuation marks.
Vowels.
The Bengali script has a total of 11 vowel graphemes, each of which is called a "sbôrôbôrnô" "vowel letter". These "sbôrôbôrnô"s represent six of the seven main vowel sounds of Bengali, along with two vowel diphthongs. All of these are used in both Bengali and Assamese, the two main languages using the script. There is no standard character in the script for the Bengali main vowel sound , and vowel length differences thought to be represented by different vowel graphemes (e.g., "hrôsbô i" vs. "dirghô i") do not hold true for the spoken language. Also, the grapheme called "ri" does not really represent a vowel phoneme, rather the sound .
When a vowel sound occurs at the beginning of a syllable or when it follows another vowel, it is written using a distinct letter. But when a vowel sound follows a consonant (or a consonant cluster), it is written with a diacritic which, depending on the vowel, can appear above, below, before or after the consonant. The diacritic cannot appear without a consonant. A diacritic form is named by adding a "-kar" to the end of the name of the corresponding vowel letter (see table below).
An exception to the above system is the vowel . This has no diacritic form, but is considered inherent in every consonant letter. To specifically denote the absence of this inherent vowel following a consonant, a diacritic called the "hôsôntô" (্) may be written underneath the consonant.
Although there are only two diphthongs in the inventory of the script, the Bengali sound system has in fact many diphthongs. Most of these diphthongs are represented by juxtaposing the graphemes of their forming vowels, as in "keu" .
The table below shows the vowels present in the modern (i.e., since late nineteenth century) inventory of the Bengali alphabet, which has abandoned three historical vowels, "rri", "li", and "lli", traditionally placed between "ri" and "e".
Consonants.
Consonant letters are called "byônjônbôrnô" "consonant letter" in Bengali. The names of these letters are typically just the consonant sound plus the inherent vowel "ô". Since the inherent vowel is assumed and not written, most letters' names look identical to the letter itself (e.g. the name of the letter is itself "ghô"). Some letters that have lost their distinctive pronunciation in Modern Bengali are called by a more elaborate name. For example, since the consonant phoneme can be written , or (depending on the spelling of the particular word), these letters are not simply called "nô"; instead, they are called "dôntyô nô" ("dental n"), "murdhônyô nô" ("cerebral n"), and "niiyô"/"ingô". Similarly, the phoneme can be written "talôbyô shô" ("palatal s"), "murdhônyô shô" ("cerebral s"), or "dôntyô sô" ("dental s"), depending on the word. Since the consonant "ngô" cannot occur at the beginning of a word in Bengali, its name is not "ngô" but "ungô" (pronounced by some as "umô" or "ũô"). Similarly, since semivowels cannot occur at the beginning of a Bengali word, the name for "semi-vowel " is not "" but "ôntôsthô ô".
The table below presents the Bengali consonant letters in their traditional order.
Consonant conjuncts.
Up to four consecutive consonants not separated by vowels can be orthographically represented as a ligature called a "consonant conjunct" (Bengali: "juktakkhôr" or "juktôbôrnô"). Typically, the first consonant in the conjunct is shown above and/or to the left of the following consonants. Many consonants appear in an abbreviated or compressed form when serving as part of a conjunct. Others simply take exceptional forms in conjuncts, bearing little or no resemblance to the base character.
Often, consonant conjuncts are not actually pronounced as would be implied by the pronunciation of the individual components. For example, adding "lô" underneath "shô" in Bengali creates the conjunct , which is not pronounced "shlô" but "slô" in Bengali. Many conjuncts represent Sanskrit sounds that were lost centuries before modern Bengali was ever spoken, as in , which is a combination of "jô" and "niô", but is not pronounced "jiô", Instead, it is pronounced "ggyõ" in modern Bengali. Thus, as conjuncts often represent (combinations of) sounds that cannot be easily understood from the components, the following descriptions are concerned only with the construction of the conjunct, and not the resulting pronunciation.
Fused forms.
Some consonants fuse in such a way that one stroke of the first consonant also serves as a stroke of the next.
Approximated forms.
Some consonants are simply written closer to one another to indicate that they are in a conjunct together.
Compressed forms.
Some consonants are compressed (and often simplified) when appearing as the first member of a conjunct.
Abbreviated forms.
Some consonants are abbreviated when appearing in conjuncts, losing part of their basic shape.
Variant forms.
Some consonants have forms that are used regularly, but only within conjuncts.
Exceptional consonant-vowel combinations.
When serving as a vowel sign, উ u, ঊ ū, and ঋ take on many exceptional forms.
Conjuncts of three consonants also exist, and follow the same rules as above. Examples include স sô + ত tô +র rô = স্ত্র strô, ম mô + প pô + র rô = ম্প্র mprô, জ jô + জ jô + ৱ wô = জ্জ্ব jjwô, ক kô + ষ + ম mô = ক্ষ্ম . Theoretically, four-consonant conjuncts can also be created, as in র rô + স sô + ট + র rô = র্স্ট্র , but these are not found in real words.
Modifiers and others.
The "jôfôla" is sometimes used as a diacritic to indicate non-Bengali vowels of various kinds in transliterated foreign words. For example, the schwa is indicated by a "jôfôla", the French u and the German umlaut ü as উ্য uyô, the German umlaut ö as ও্য oyô or এ্য eyô, etc.
The apostrophe, known in Bengali as ঊর্ধ্বকমা "urdhbôkôma" "upper comma", is sometimes used to distinguish between homographs, as in পাটা "paţa" "plank" and পা'টা "paţa" "the leg". Sometimes a hyphen is used for the same purpose (as in পা-টা, an alternative of পা'টা).
Digits and numerals.
The Bengali script has ten Numerical digits (graphemes or symbols indicating the numbers from 0 to 9). Bengali numerals have no horizontal headstroke or মাত্রা "matra".
Numbers larger than 9 are written in Bengali using a positional base 10 numeral system (the decimal system). A period or dot is used to denote the decimal separator, which separates the integral and the fractional parts of a decimal number. When writing large numbers with many digits, commas are used as delimiters to group digits, indicating the thousand (হাজার "hajar"), the hundred thousand or lakh (লাখ "lakh" or লক্ষ "lôkkhô"), and the ten million or hundred lakh or crore (কোটি "") units. In other words, going leftwards from the decimal separator, the first grouping consists of three digits, and the subsequent groupings always consist of 2 digits.
For example, the English number 17,557,345 will be written in traditional Bengali as ১,৭৫,৫৭,৩৪৫ (এক কোটি, পঁচাত্তর লাখ, সাতান্ন হাজার, তিন শত পঁয়তাল্লিশ "", "one crore, seventy-five lakhs, fifty-seven thousand, three hundred forty-five").
The "matra".
Unlike in western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter-forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called মাত্রা "matra". The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter ত "tô" and the numeral ৩ "3" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the "matra", as is the case between the consonant cluster ত্র "trô" and the independent vowel এ "e". The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).
Punctuation marks.
Bengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke daŗi (|), the Bengali equivalent of a full stop, have been adopted from western scripts and their usage is similar. Commas, semicolons, colons, quotation marks, etc. are the same as in English. The concept of using capital letters is absent in the Bengali script, hence proper names are unmarked.
Characteristics of the Bengali text.
Direction.
Bengali text is written and read horizontally, from left to right.
Size.
The consonant graphemes and the full form of vowel graphemes fit into an imaginary rectangle of uniform size (i.e. uniform width and height). The size of a consonant conjunct, regardless of its complexity, is deliberately maintained the same as that of a single consonant grapheme, so that diacritic vowel forms can be attached to it without any distortion.
Spacing.
In a typical Bengali text, orthographic words, i.e., words as they are written, can be seen as being separated from each other by an even spacing. Graphemes within a word are also evenly spaced, but this spacing is much narrower than the spacing between words.
Punctuation marks.
As discussed earlier, the Bengali punctuation marks are often the same as their English counterparts, both in form and function.
Characteristics of the orthographic word.
In every Bengali orthographic word, one can find different kinds of graphemes and their combinations, and they are as follows:
The "matra".
The "matra" or the horizontal headstroke on each grapheme usually add up and often form a continuous single headstroke over the entire orthographic word, with different graphemes hanging down from it. This gives Bengali text a distinct look.
Grapheme frequency count.
According to Bengali linguist Munier Chowdhury, there are about 9 graphemes that are the most frequent in Bengali texts, shown with its percentage of appearance in the table in right.
Inconsistencies.
The following inconsistencies are inherent in the Bengali script and orthography. They often put additional burden on the person learning the script. The inconsistencies manifest themselves in various ways. Sometimes there are multiple different letters or symbols for the same sound (over-production). Sometimes a letter loses its original sound value. In other instances, the coverage of phonological information by the script is incomplete, inconsistent and/or ambiguous. Most of these inconsistencies can be attributed to the fact that the script was originally conceived to represent Sanskrit sounds.
Redundant graphemes for the vowel sounds ' and '.
The Bengali script has two symbols for the vowel sound and two symbols for the vowel sound . This redundancy stems from the time when this script was used to write Sanskrit, a language that had a short ই and a long ঈ , and a short উ and a long ঊ . These letters are preserved in the Bengali script with their traditional names, despite the fact that they are no longer pronounced differently in ordinary speech. These graphemes do serve an etymological function, however, in preserving the original Sanskrit spelling in "tôtsômô" Bengali words (i.e., words that were borrowed from Sanskrit).
The vowel grapheme ঋ "ri".
The grapheme called "ri" does not really represent a vowel phoneme in Bengali, rather the consonant-vowel combination . Nevertheless, it is included in the vowel section of the inventory of the Bengali script. This inconsistency is also a remnant from Sanskrit, where the grapheme represents a retroflex approximant, a sound considered a vowel in Sanskrit.
The vowel sound "".
Even though the near-open front unrounded vowel is one of the seven main vowel sounds in the standard Bengali language, no distinct vowel symbol has been allotted for it in the script, since there is no sound in Sanskrit, the primary written language when the script was conceived. As a result, this sound is orthographically realized by multiple means in modern Bengali orthography, usually using some combination of এ, অ, আ and the jôfôla (diacritic form of the consonant grapheme য "jô") as seen in the following examples:
ত and ৎ.
In the native Bengali words, syllable-final ত "tô" is pronounced , as in নাতনি "grand daughter", করাত "saw", etc.
ৎ (called খণ্ড-ত "" "broken "tô"") is always used syllable-finally and always pronounced as . It is predominantly found in loan words from Sanskrit such as ভবিষ্যৎ "bhôbishyôt" "future", সত্যজিৎ "sôtyôjit" (a proper name), etc. It is also found in some onomatopoeic words (such as থপাৎ "thôpat" "sound of something heavy that fell", মড়াৎ "môɽat" "sound of something breaking", etc.), as the first member of some consonant conjuncts (such as ৎস tsô, ৎপ tpô, ৎক tkô, etc.), and in some foreign loanwords (e.g. নাৎসি "natsi" "Nazi", জুজুৎসু "jujutsu" "Jujutsu", ৎসুনামি "tsunami" "Tsunami", etc.) which contain the same conjuncts.
This is an over-production inconsistency, where the sound is realized by both ত and ৎ. This creates confusion among inexperienced writers of Bengali. There is no simple way of telling which symbol should be used. Usually, the contexts where ৎ is used need to be memorized, as these are less frequent.
শ, ষ and স.
Three graphemes—শ "palatal s", ষ "cerebral s", and স "dental s"—are used to represent the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative , as seen in their word-final pronunciations in ফিসফিস "fisfis" "whisper", বিশ "biśh" "twenty" and বিষ "biṣh" "poison". The grapheme স "dental s", however, does retain the voiceless alveolar fricative sound when used as the first component in certain consonant conjuncts as in স্খলন "sthôlôn" "fall", স্পন্দন "spôndôn" "beat", etc.
জ and য.
There are two letters জ "jô" and য "jô" for the voiced postalveolar affricate (jô sound). Compare জাল "net" and যাও "Go!".
What was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal ণ is now pronounced as an alveolar (unless conjoined with another retroflex consonant such as ট, ঠ, ড and ঢ), although the spelling does not reflect this change.
Romanization.
The romanization of Bengali is the representation of the Bengali language in the Latin script. There are various ways of Romanization systems of Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. While different standards for romanization have been proposed for Bengali, these have not been adopted with the degree of uniformity seen in languages such as Japanese or Sanskrit. The Bengali script has often been included with the group of Indic scripts for romanization where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the "International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration" or IAST system (based on diacritics), "Indian languages Transliteration" or ITRANS (uses upper case alphabets suited for ASCII keyboards), and the National Library at Calcutta romanization.
In the context of Bengali Romanization, it is important to distinguish transliteration from transcription. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced). Since English does not have the sounds of Bengali, and since pronunciation does not completely reflect the spellings, not being faithful to both.
Although it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently Romanized on Wikipedia using a phonemic transcription, where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written. The Wikipedia Romanization scheme is given in the table below, with the transcriptions as used above.
History.
The Portuguese missionaries stationed in Bengal in the 16th century were the first people to employ the Latin alphabet in writing Bengali books, the most famous of which are the "Crepar Xaxtrer Orth, Bhed" and the "Vocabolario em idioma Bengalla, e Portuguez dividido em duas partes", both written by Manuel da Assumpção. But the Portuguese-based romanization did not take root. In the late 18th century Augustin Aussant used a romanization scheme based on the French alphabet. At the same time, Nathaniel Brassey Halhed used a romanization scheme based on English for his Bengali grammar book. After Halhed, the renowned English philologist and oriental scholar Sir William Jones devised a romanization scheme for Bengali and for Indian languages in general, and published it in the "Asiatick Researches" journal in 1801. This scheme came to be known as the "Jonesian System" of romanization, and served as a model for the next century and a half.
Transliteration vs transcription.
The Romanization of a language written in a non-Roman script can be based on transliteration (orthographically accurate, i.e. the original spelling can be recovered) or transcription (phonetically accurate, i.e. the pronunciation can be reproduced). This distinction is important in Bengali as its orthography was adopted from Sanskrit, and ignores sound change processes of several millennia. To some degree, all writing systems differ from the way the language is pronounced, but this may be more extreme for languages like Bengali. For example, the three letters শ, ষ, and স had distinct pronunciations in Sanskrit, but over several centuries, the standard pronunciation of Bengali (usually modeled on the Nadia dialect), has lost these phonetic distinctions (all three are usually pronounced as IPA ) while the spelling distinction nevertheless persists in orthography.
In written texts, it is easy to distinguish between homophones such as শাপ "shap" "curse" and সাপ "shap" "snake". Such a distinction could be particularly relevant in searching for the term in an encyclopedia, for example. However, the fact that the words sound identical means that they would be transcribed identically; thus, some important meaning distinctions cannot be rendered in a transcription model. Another issue with transcription systems is that cross-dialectal and cross-register differences are widespread, and thus the same word or lexeme may have many different transcriptions. Even simple words like মন "mind" may be pronounced "mon", "môn", or (in poetry) "mônô" (e.g. the Indian national anthem, Jana Gana Mana).
Often, different phonemes (meaningfully different sounds) are represented by the same symbol or grapheme. Thus, the vowel এ can represent both (এল "elo" "came"), or (এক "êk" "one"). Occasionally, words written in the same way (homographs) may have different pronunciations for differing meanings: মত can mean "opinion" (pronounced "môt"), or "similar to" ("môtô"). Thus, some important phonemic distinctions cannot be rendered in a transliteration model. In addition, when representing a Bengali word to allow speakers of other languages to pronounce it easily, it may be better to use a transcription, which does not include the silent letters and other idiosyncrasies (e.g. স্বাস্থ্য "sbasthyô", spelled <swāsthya>, or অজ্ঞান "ôggên", spelled <ajñāna>) that make Bengali romanization so complicated. Those spelled letters are false to phonetic romanization of Bengali and is a result of often inclusion of the Bengali script with other Indic scripts for romanizations, where the other Incic scripts don't carry the inherited vowel ô, thus making Bengali romanization a mess.
Comparison of romanizations.
Comparisons of standard romanization schemes for Bengali are given in the table below. Two standards are commonly used for transliteration of Indic languages including Bengali. Many standards (e.g. NLK / ISO), use diacritic marks and permit case markings for proper nouns. Newer forms (e.g. Harvard-Kyoto) are more suited for ASCII-derivative keyboards, and use upper- and lower-case letters contrastively and forgo normal standards for English capitalization.
Examples.
The following table includes examples of Bengali words Romanized using the various systems mentioned above.
Romanization reference.

Nicholas Metcalfe

Nicholas Metcalfe (died 1539) was an English churchman and college head.
Life.
He graduated B.A., possibly from Michaelhouse, Cambridge, in 1494/5, became M.A. in 1498, B.D. in 1503/4 and D.D. in 1506/7. He was Archdeacon of Rochester from 1512. He was also prebendary of Lincoln, and rector of Woodham Ferrers.
He was master of St. John's College, Cambridge from 1518. He built up the endowments: Metcalfe was in close touch with John Fisher, his bishop in the Diocese of Rochester and as executor to Lady Margaret Beaufort a major force behind the foundation of St. John's. Through Fisher St John's in 1524 took over property from run-down nunneries, at Bromhall in Berkshire and Lillechurch (Higham) in Kent. Another Kent property Fisher obtained was that of a hospital at Ospringe.
A steady Catholic and opponent of Hugh Latimer, Metcalfe was later praised across the religious divide by Roger Ascham for his concern for learning and its encouragement. He opposed the divorce of Henry VIII from Catherine of Aragon. In the end, by 1536, he conformed to the new church settlement. He was still compelled to resign as Master in 1537.

100 St Georges Terrace

100 St Georges Terrace is a 24-storey skyscraper in Perth, Western Australia. It is a mixed retail and commercial property located at 100 St Georges Terrace. The retail component, named enex100, is made up of three floors of shops and food outlets between St Georges Terrace and the Hay Street Mall. The office tower is high and the project was the first office building constructed in Perth to a 4.5-star Australian Building Greenhouse Rating.
Site history.
The St Georges Terrace side of the site was formerly occupied by several buildings. The site adjacent to Trinity Church was opened as a branch of the Union Bank in 1885. The seven-storey New Zealand Insurance Company building was constructed at 100 St Georges Terrace in 1927, followed by the neighbouring six-storey Airways House in 1933. The Union Bank became ANZ Bank, and in May 1963 it vacated its building to allow for the construction of a modern replacement building on the same site. The replacement ANZ Bank was 14-storeys tall and was opened in November 1965 by Premier David Brand. The site also became home to the National Mutual Arcade.
The Hay Street side of the site was home to department store Sandovers. The original building on the site designed by architect J. Talbot Hobbs was destroyed by fire in 1907 and replaced with a new building. This remained the home of Sandovers until the company closed down late in the 20th century, and the facade remains standing to this day.
The ANZ Bank Building was demolished in the late 1980s, and the National Mutual Arcade was demolished in early 1991. This was to make way for a A$100 million development retail arcade and 39-storey office tower, however due to a market downturn the plans never eventuated. Instead, the St Georges Terrace half of the site was landscaped into a park and the northern half saw construction of a Toys "R" Us store.
Redevelopment.
In 2001, Futuris Corporation subsidiary Caversham Properties obtained a $30 million option over the site to develop an office tower. In 2002 Futuris unveiled its plans to build a $120 million, 27-storey tower on the site named Century City, and received planning approval for the development. The development would include a large shopping centre and cinema beneath the office tower. The development did not attract sufficient interest from major tenants, and Futuris' option was terminated.
After the termination of Futuris' option, an option to develop the site was taken up by Pivot Group, the private group of Incitec chairman Peter Laurance, in September 2003. At this time, the site was owned by AXA Statutory Fund, and managed by Deutsche Asset Management. On 17 December 2004, the Pivot Group exercised its option to buy the site from Axa Pacific for A$30 million. On the same day, it announced fresh redevelopment plans for the site. The development was undertaken as a joint venture between Incitec and the Industry Superannuation Property Trust (ISPT), the latter of which also owned the nearby Forrest Chase shopping centre. Upon completion, ISPT would take full ownership of the property. In order to facilitate the redevelopment, the properties fronting the Hay Street Mall were purchased by the Pivot Group.
Development approval was received from the City of Perth in April 2004. The project was to be the largest retail development in the Perth central business district since Forrest Chase was completed in 1989. Construction was initially expected to begin in early 2005, and the building was expected to have a value upon completion of A$140 million.
The plans included underground car park as well as a 22-bay loading dock, which was to be used by tenants of the shopping centre as well as other retailers on the Hay Street Mall. However, despite wanting such a loading dock for the mall since 1989, the City of Perth refused to invest public money in the project.
Before construction started, supermarket chain Woolworths took up a 20-year lease over of space in the retail component of the project, out of a total of of total retail space.
The development was structured so that if there was insufficient demand for office space, the office tower would be scrapped in favour of a pure retail development. Due to an economic boom in Western Australia, during planning and construction the retail and office rental markets in the Perth CBD dried up, with vacancy rates falling to record lows. Despite this and rents among the lowest in the Perth office market, the developers had trouble securing an anchor tenant for the office tower portion of the development. The developers confirmed in October 2005 that the construction of the office tower would go ahead without an anchor tenant.
Existing leases over the remaining buildings fronting the Hay Street Mall expired at the end of January 2006, and demolition started in February 2006. The heritage-listed facades of these buildings were retained and incorporated into the new development. Demolition was complete by April 2006, with construction by building company Multiplex expected to get underway by July 2006. By this stage, the cost of the development had been revised to $250 million.
Axiom Properties joined the development on 27 June 2006, investing A$5 million in exchange for half of the profits of the office tower portion of the development.
The first major office tenancy was achieved in March 2007 when Japanese oil and gas giant Inpex signed a 10-year lease over of space across the building's top four floors. This was followed by the National Australia Bank which took up of space in the tower and became its anchor tenant, to enable it to shift from its current location in St Martins Centre. The bank also leased of retail space over two levels to open a new retail headquarters fronting St Georges Terrace, and secured signage rights to the building. Apache Energy also committed to in the building. Closer to the building's completion, NOPSA leased of space, and engineering company Kellogg Brown & Root and subsidiary Geanherne took up of space in the building, bringing it to 97 percent leased. The remaining 3% of available space was taken by Microsoft shortly after completion upon their relocation from QV.1.
During construction, ISPT bought out Axiom Properties' share of the project and renamed it from "Century City" to "100 St Georges Terrace", with the retail component called "enex100". The rationale for this change was to reflect a more modern image, with the former name considered "too conservative". The name "enex100" is apparently derived from the slogan "enjoy and expect the unexpected".
The initial stage of the retail project, made up of shops fronting the Hay Street Mall, opened in mid-December 2008. The second stage of the retail centre was made up of the Woolworths supermarket, JB Hi-Fi and an upmarket food court on the podium level. Woolworths was opened on 8 June 2009, and was the chain's 800th store in Australia. The remainder of the complex was officially opened by Perth MLA John Hyde.
In December 2009, Greenhouse bar and restaurant was opened at the front of the complex on St Georges Terrace. Designed by Joost Bakker, the building is built entirely of recycled and/or recyclable materials, and was constructed over a 14 day period by a team of workers. The exterior walls of the restaurant are covered with approximately 4000 Strawberry plants, with the internal walls being made of Plywood and insulated with 420 Straw bales. The rooftop bar is also home to a produce garden and worm farm.
Design.
The development was designed by architects Hames Sharley, who were also responsible for the design of the Swan Bells belltower. The complex is made up of an office tower fronting St Georges Terrace with 19 storeys of offices, and four plant floor levels rising above three levels of retail between the Hay Street Mall and the Terrace. A further four basement floors contain tenant parking and building services. The design of the shopping centre was modelled around suburban shopping centres such as Chadstone Shopping Centre in Melbourne and Chatswood Chase in Sydney, rather than based upon traditional CBD arcade layouts.
Before commencing construction, the developers committed to achieving a 4.5-star Australian Building Greenhouse Rating for the project. This added 10 percent to the cost of the building, and the developers indicated that achieving a 5-star rating would be prohibitively expensive.
Floor plates in the office building are in area, and are described by the management as virtually "column-free" and with "high windows". There is a total of of net lettable office space in the development.
Tenants.
Major tenants in the office tower include:

Mikhail Sabinin

Mikhail (Gobron) Sabinin (, ) (1845-1900) was a Russo-Georgian monk, historian of the Georgian Orthodox Church and icon painter. 
He was born to the Russian priest from Tver, Pavel Sabinin, and a Georgian woman. Educated at the Tiflis gymnasium in the 1860s, he then attended St. Petersburg Theologian Academy and attained to a magister degree for his work "History of the Georgian Church until the End of the 6th Century" ("История грузинской церкви до конца VI в." [СПб., 1877]), the first comprehensive treatment of the subject produced in Russian. He travelled in several regions of Georgia, studying monuments of Christian architecture, copying frescos and icons, recording legends and collecting manuscripts. In St. Petersburg, he was tonsured a monk and given the name Gobron after a 10th-century Georgian saint. In 1882, he published "The Paradise of Georgia" (საქართველოს სამოთხე; St. Petersburg, 1882), a voluminous lithographed edition of biographies of important Georgian Orthodox Christian saints. In the 1880s, he served at the famous Iviron Monastery on Mount Athos. In 1882 he published also "The Passion of Eustathius of Mtskheta". 
In 1898, he clashed with the office of Russian exarchate at Tiflis over his criticism of Russification and was removed from Georgia to Moscow where he died of pneumonia on May 10, 1900.

Sacred Steel (band)

Biography.
The band has roots back till in the 80s when almost all of the members were already playing in bands that could gather underground acclaim. But not before the foundation of Sacred Steel, they were able to draw larger attention and success. After opening for bands like Blitzkrieg they were signed to Metal Blade Records in April 1997 being the first German band ever to do so. 
Their debut album 'Reborn In Steel' was released October 1997 and with great press and fan response, Sacred Steel became one of the top German metal acts in a short time, maybe also due to the renaissance of True metal and successes of bands like Hammerfall.
They released two more albums on Metal Blade: 'Wargods Of Metal' in 1998 (produced by Bill Metoyer of Slayer and Helstar fame) and 'Bloodlust'. Their third album was 'Bloodlust' in 2000, a concept album that saw the band broaden their stylistic horizon but, of course, staying a committed true metal band to the bone.
They played many festivals in Europe, mostly underground ones but also the renowned Wacken Open Air twice and went on tour with many bands, e.g. Primal Fear and Children Of Bodom.
After signing to Massacre Records they released 'Slaughter Prophecy' in 2002 which again saw the band playing around with a wide variety of influences that revealed the decades-long love of the musicians for all kinds of heavy metal. Some of the new songs even bordered on Doom metal or Death metal. The last album of the original lineup was 'Iron Blessings' that was released with a big bang in October 2004 - that very release show has been turned into a live CD and DVD under the title 'Live Blessings' (released 2006).
After a year-long hiatus Jörg Michael Knittel and Oliver Großhans, the two original guitarists, left Sacred Steel to pursue their Death-Metal project "My Darkest Hate". Jens Sonnenberg switched from bass guitar to guitar and two new members were quickly brought in: Kai Schindelar on bass guitar, the former guitar tech and roadie Jonas Khalil as additional guitarist. 
2006 saw the release of the first album with the new lineup which had been recorded with Sodom producer Harris Johns. 'Hammer Of Destruction' was a 'back to the roots'-album for the band and had very strong songs that reminded of rather archetypical heavy metal bands like early Metallica, Iron Maiden, Jag Panzer, Megadeth or Helstar. It was again a success with fans and media and even spawned a video clip to 'Maniacs Of Speed'
Style & Aesthetic.
Sacred Steel can be located somewhere between classic European True metal and heavier Thrash- or Speed Metal, but also draw lots of influences like Fantasy Metal or Doom metal. They have albeit managed to create a very genuine style from their first album on which is mostly due to the unique and unusual vocal performance of singer Gerrit P. Mutz.
Their lyrics deal with typical genre topics like battles (especially visible on the concept album 'Bloodlust') or Heavy Metal in general and never fail to offer an honest and dedicated, yet good humoured stance (e.g. the anthems 'Sacred Steel' and 'Sacred Bloody Steel').
2009 - Carnage Victory.

<doc id="21378595" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21378595" title="SeHCAT">
SeHCAT

SeHCAT is the usual name for 23-seleno-25-homo-tauro-cholic acid (selenium homocholic acid taurine or tauroselcholic acid). It is used in a clinical test to diagnose bile acid malabsorption.
Development.
SeHCAT is a taurine-conjugated bile acid analog which was synthesized for use as a radiopharmaceutical to investigate "in vivo" the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. By incorporating the gamma-emitter 75Se into the SeHCAT molecule, the retention in the body or the loss of this compound into the feces could be studied easily using a standard gamma camera, available in most clinical nuclear medicine departments.
SeHCAT has been shown to be absorbed from the gut and excreted into the bile at the same rate as cholic acid, one of the major natural bile acids in humans. It undergoes secretion into the biliary tree, gallbladder and intestine in response to food, and is reabsorbed efficiently in the ileum, with kinetics similar to natural bile acids. It was soon shown to be the most convenient and accurate method available to assess and measure bile acid turnover in the intestine. SeHCAT testing was commercially developed by Amersham International Ltd (Amersham plc is now part of GE Healthcare Medical Diagnostics division) for clinical use to investigate malabsorption in patients with diarrhea. This test has replaced 14C-labeled glycocholic acid (or taurocholic acid) breath tests and fecal bile acid measurements, which now have no place in the routine clinical investigation of malabsorption.
Procedure.
A capsule containing radiolabelled 75SeHCAT (with 370kBq of Selenium-75 and less than 0.1 mg SeHCAT) is taken orally. The physical half life of 75Se is approximately 118 days; activity is adjusted to a standard reference date. Patients are often fasted before taking the capsule and swallow water to ensure passage of the capsule into the gastrointestinal tract. The effective dose of radiation for an adult given 370kBq of SeHCAT is 0.26mSv. (For comparison, the radiation exposure from an abdominal CT scan is quoted at 5.3mSv and annual background exposure in the UK 1-3mSv.) Measurements were originally performed with a whole body counter but are usually performed now with an uncollimated gamma camera. The patient is scanned supine or prone with anterior and posterior acquisition from head to thigh 1 to 3 hours after taking the capsule. Scanning is repeated after 7 days. Background values are subtracted and care must be taken to avoid external sources of radiation in a nuclear medicine department.
From these measurements, the percent retention of SeHCAT at 7 days is calculated. A 7-day SeHCAT retention value greater than 15% is considered to be normal, with values less than 15% signifing excessive bile acid loss, as found in bile acid malabsorption.
With more frequent measurements, it is possible to calculate SeHCAT retention whole body half-life; this is not routinely measured in a clinical setting. A half-life of greater than 2.8 days has been quoted as normal.
Clinical use.
The SeHCAT test is used to investigate patients with suspected bile acid malabsorption, who usually experience chronic diarrhea, often passing watery feces 5 to 10 times each day. When ileum has been removed following surgery, or is inflamed in Crohn's disease, the 7-day SeHCAT retention usually is abnormal, and most of these patients will benefit from treatment with bile acid sequestrants. The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is reduced in these patients with ileal abnormalities and, as the normal bile acid retention exceeds 95%, only a small degree of change is needed. Bile acid malabsorption can also be secondary to cholecystectomy, vagotomy and other disorders affecting intestinal motility or digestion such as radiation enteritis, celiac disease and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
A similar picture of chronic diarrhea, an abnormal SeHCAT retention and a response to bile acid sequestrants, in the absence of other disorders of the intestine, is characteristic of idiopathic bile acid malabsorption – also called primary bile acid diarrhea. These patients are frequently misdiagnosed as having the irritable bowel syndrome, as clinicians fail to recognize the condition, do not think of performing a SeHCAT test, or do not have it available.
There have been at least 18 studies of the use of SeHCAT testing in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome patients. When these data were combined, 32% of 1223 patients had a SeHCAT 7-day retention of less than 10%, and 80% of these reported a response to cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant.

Saudi list of most wanted suspected terrorists

Periodically Saudi Arabias Ministry of Interior publishes a most wanted list.
According to "Asharq Alawsat" Saudi Arabia has published four lists of "most wanted" suspected terrorists, and those lists contained 19, 26, 36 and 85 individuals.
The list of 85 most wanted suspected terrorists published in February 2009 named eleven former Guantanamo captives.
Earlier lists.
On May 7, 2003, the Saudi Interior Ministry announced a list of 19 names who it said were planning to carry out subversive activities. On May 12, 2003 Riyadh compound bombings took place.
List of December 6, 2003.
A list published on December 5, 2003 contained twenty-six names.
When a new list was published in February 2009 Carol Rosenberg, writing in the "Miami Herald", reported that all but one of the captives had been killed or captured.
List of June 28, 2005.
The list of June 28, 2005 contained thirty-six names.
The Saudi government encouraged those named on the list to surrender, and promised lenient treatment.
By April 7, 2007 the Saudi government reported that twenty-three of those individuals had been killed or captured.
List of February 3, 2009.
The most recently published list was published on February 3, 2009.
It listed 85 individuals, 83 of whom were Saudis, and two were from Yemen. 
Carol Rosenberg, reporting in the "Miami Herald", wrote that six of the men on the new most wanted list were former Guantanamo captives.
Robert Worth, reporting in the "New York Times", wrote that fourteen Saudis, formerly held in Guantanamo, had fallen under suspicion of supporting terrorism following their release.
The men were all believed to be living outside of Saudi Arabia, some of them receiving militant training.
They were promised lenient treatment, and encouraged to turn themselves in at the nearest Saudi embassy.
Those on the new list include three Saudis who appeared in a threatening al Qaeda video:
Said Ali al-Shihri, Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Awfi and Nasir al-Wuhayshi, and another individual named Abdullah al-Qarawi.
Al-Wuhayshi claims he is the leader of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.
Al-Qarawi is reported to be the leader of Al-Qaida in the Persian Gulf.
Al-Shihri and Al-Awfi are former Guantanamo captives, and Al-Shihri stated he was Al-Wuyashi's deputy.
The "Saudi Gazette" reported that Saudi security officials identified an individual named Saleh Al-Qaraawi as the leader of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.
An article published in "Asharq Alawsat" on February 6, 2009, noted the range in age among the suspects—from seventeen to fifty-two.
This article named Abdullah El Qarawi, who it described as the "most dangerous" individual on the list, as the leader of Al Qaeda operations in the Persian Gulf.
According to the article Abdullah El Qarawi is just 26 years old, and most of the individuals on the list are between 25 and 25.
The article listed the names and ages of fifteen other individuals.
Another article in the "Asharq Alawsat" identified other individual from the list, including: Abdullah al-Abaed—wanted for the assassination of a senior police official, and Mohamed Abul-Khair, one of Osama bin Laden's bodyguards, and one of his sons-in-law.
On February 7, 2009 the "Saudi Gazette" reported some details of some of the wanted men.
The article named seven men it identified as former Guantanamo captives, and five other most wanted suspected terrorists it did not identify as former Guantanamo captives.
Suspects who remain at large, or otherwise unaccounted for.
According to the "Agence France Presse" the "SPA News Agency" reported on May 23, 2009 that three Saudis suspected of ties to Al Qaida returned to Saudi Arabia and turned themselves in to authorities.
The "Arab News" reported the identities of the three men were not made public, but that they had not been listed on the February 2009 most-wanted list.
The "Saudi Gazette" reported that only two of the men voluntarily surrendered and that the third man was captured in Yemen.
On October 19, 2010, when reporting the surrender of Jabir Jubran Al Fayfi and Badr Mohammed Nasser al-Shihri the "Associated Press" asserted that 70 of the original 85 men named on the list remained at large or unaccounted for.

Benoît Moerlen

Benoît Moerlen (born 6 February 1956) is a French percussionist, best known for his work in Gong, Pierre Moerlen's Gong and a later off-shoot Gongzilla.
History.
Benoît Moerlen studied the vibraphone at the Strasbourg Conservatory, where his elder brother Pierre Moerlen had also studied percussion.
Benoît Moerlen first played with Gong on 1974's "You", Pierre already being a member. He joined more permanently for "Gazeuse!" (1976) and "Expresso II" (1978) when the band had come under Pierre's leadership. The latter was released under the Gong name in the UK, but as by Pierre Moerlen's Gong in North America. The band toured Europe in support. Benoît remained with the band for "Downwind" (1979) and "Live" (released 1980). Having left in 1979, Benoît joined Pierre in Mike Oldfield's touring band, and he appears on the resultant live album "Exposed" (1979).
He re-joined Pierre Moerlen's Gong in the late 1980s for "Second Wind" and "Full Circle Live '88", also playing additional keyboards. He also appeared with Pierre on Oldfield's "Islands" (1987).
Benoît Moerlen was then a founding member of Gongzilla, playing vibraphone and marimba, with bassist Hansford Rowe and guitarist Bon Logaza, with whom he had played in Pierre Moerlen's Gong. They released "Suffer" (1995) and "Thrive" (1996, with guests David Torn and Gary Husband).
Benoît also plays solo marimba concerts in France, Belgium and Germany, and works in a duo called Akimbo with the German vibraphone player Stefan Traub. In 2005, Benoît was rehearsing with Pierre for a new line-up of Pierre Moerlen's Gong when Pierre died in his sleep.

Charles George Everard

History.
Dr Charles George Everard MD (1794 – 30 March 1876) was a physician, pioneer farmer and Member of the Legislative Council, in the early days of South Australia.
Early life.
Charles was born in Marshfield Gloucestershire on 29 August 1794 He, his wife Catherine (1786 – 1866), and children William (1819 - 1889), Charles John (1821 – 1892) and James George (died 1840 at aged 15) of Gloucestershire, arrived in Adelaide from London on the ship "Africaine" under Captain John Finlay Duff on 9 November 1836, and were present at the Proclamation of the new Colony.
Contribution to South Australia.
Before leaving England he had purchased Sections 43 and 44 in the Hundred of Adelaide and eight Town Acres. He built his first house on one of these, on the corner of Hindley and Morphett Streets, along with a row of shops. He then turned his attention to Section 43 on the Bay Road (now Anzac Highway). Around 1838 he acquired Section 52 from Walter Thompson, making a total of 138 acres. By 1841 he and son William had cropped several acres of wheat and some barley, and built two cottages; one of pine and one of brick.
In 1938, he built a house at what is now 87 Anzac Highway, called Ashford House and is currently used for the Errington Special Education Centre.
Charles George Everard was one of the first eighteen appointed in 1839 to South Australia's newly created unicameral Legislative Council, was appointed J.P., and was elected to the Legislative Council in 1857 representing the South district.
Everard Park, South Australia was once part of his extensive land holdings.
Other.
The Electoral district of Ashford's name derives from the name given by Everard sometime before 1845 to his property 'Ashford', that was thought to have the best orchard in the colony. The name was also given to a suburb within the electorate: Ashford, South Australia

Patrick Gleeson

Patrick Gleeson (born Nov. 9, 1934) is a musician, synthesizer pioneer, composer and producer, from California, USA. 
Gleeson began experimenting with electronic music in the mid-'60s at the San Francisco Tape Music Center using a Buchla synth and other devices.
In 1968, "upon hearing Walter Carlos' "Switched-On Bach"", he bought a Moog synthesizer and opened recording studio Different Fur.
He worked with Herbie Hancock in the early 1970s, touring with Hancock – thus pioneering the use of synthesizers outside the studio – and appearing on the albums "Crossings" and "Sextant". Hancock has credited Gleeson with introducing him to synthesizers and teaching him technique. "Sextant" and "Headhunters" were both recorded in part at Different Fur studios. Gleeson has worked with many other Jazz musicians, including Lenny White, Freddie Hubbard, Charles Earland, Eddie Henderson and Joe Henderson.
Gleeson recorded a number of solo albums, starting with "Beyond the Sun - An Electronic Portrait of Holst's "The Planets"" in 1976, to which Walter Carlos contributed the sleeve notes. The album was nominated for a "best engineered recording-classical" Grammy in 1976. "Beyond the Sun" was followed in 1977 by a more commercial album, "Patrick Gleeson's Star Wars". 
He worked as an engineer on the 1978 Devo album "", part of which was recorded at Different Fur.
He sold his interest in Different Fur in 1985. 
Gleeson has been involved in the scoring of a number of film soundtracks, including "The Plague Dogs", "Apocalypse Now", "Crossroads" and "The Bedroom Window". He has scored nine television series, including "Knot's Landing".

Process architecture

Process architecture is the structural design of general process systems and applies to fields such as computers (software, hardware, networks, etc.), business processes (enterprise architecture, policy and procedures, logistics, project management, etc.), and any other process system of varying degrees of complexity.
Processes are defined as having inputs, outputs and the energy required to transform inputs to outputs. Use of energy during transformation also implies a passage of time: a process takes real time to perform its associated action. A process also requires space for input/output objects and transforming objects to exist: a process uses real space.
A process system is a specialized system of processes. Processes are composed of processes. Complex processes are made up of several processes that are in turn made up of several processes. This results in an overall structural hierarchy of abstraction. If the process system is studied hierarchically, it is easier to understand and manage; therefore, process architecture requires the ability to consider process systems hierarchically. Graphical modeling of process architectures is considered by Dualistic Petri nets. Mathematical consideration of process architectures may be found in CCS and the π-calculus.
The structure of a process system, or its architecture, can be viewed as a dualistic relationship of its infrastructure and suprastructure. The infrastructure describes a process system's component parts and their interactions. The suprastructure considers the super system of which the process system is a part. (Suprastructure should not be confused with superstructure, which is actually part of the infrastructure built for (external) support.) As one traverses the process architecture from one level of abstraction to the next, infrastructure becomes the basis for suprastructure and vice versa as one looks within a system or without. 
Requirements for a process system are derived at every hierarchical level. Black-box requirements for a system come from its suprastructure. Customer requirements are black-box requirements near, if not at, the top of a process architecture's hierarchy. White-box requirements, such as engineering rules, programming syntax, etc., come from the process system's infrastructure.
Process systems are a dualistic phenomenon of change/no-change or form/transform and as such, are 
well-suited to being modeled by the bipartite Petri Nets modeling system and in particular, process-class Dualistic Petri nets where processes can be simulated in real time and space and studied hierarchically.

Pierre-Barthélemy Gheusi

Pierre-Barthélemy Gheusi, also known by the pseudonym Norbert Lorédan, (21 November 1865 – 30 January 1943) was a French theatre director, librettist, journalist and writer. He was born in Toulouse and died in Paris. 
Biography.
A son of a banker and distant cousin of Gambetta, Pierre-Barthélemy Gheusi studied at the college in Castres, where he met Jean Jaurès, who was at that time a tutor there, and became a friend of the doctor and scholar François de Vesian. He went to study law in Toulouse. 
In 1887–1888, at the instigation of Laurent Tailhade, Gheusi worked on the revue "Le Décadent", but his literary career struggled to take off, despite the recommendations of Émile Zola and Catulle Mendès. 
Gheusi was involved in republican politics and joined the electoral campaign of Jaurès in the legislative elections of 1889 in Castres. In the following years, the government called on his services from time to time. In 1897, Ernest Constans sent him on an inspection tour of Christian schools in Palestine. After a short period at the Ministère des Colonies in 1906, beside Georges Leygues (also from south west France), he was charged by Jean Cruppi, then minister of Foreign Affairs, to work in 1911 for the restoration of diplomatic relations between France and Venezuela.
In 1894, he married Adrienne Willems, nièce of the painter Florent Willems and frequented, alongside many free-thinkers and free-masons, the Luscrambo, an association which grouped the Toulousains of Paris, founded by the singer and future director of the Opéra Pedro Gailhard. 
His novel "Gaucher Myrian", written in collaboration with the Bordeaux intellectual and musicologist Anatole Loquin was published in 1893, and attests to his interest in catharism. In 1906, he became a member of the Eglise gnostique catholique, alongside Léonce-Eugène Fabre des Essarts and Gabriel Fauré.
In 1897, Arthur Meyer entrusted him with the direction of the illustrated literary supplement of the "Gaulois" which had just been created with the title "Le Gaulois du dimanche". In 1899, he bought the "Nouvelle Revue" from Juliette Adam. Under his direction, this periodical enjoyed a particularly brilliant period. 
In 1911, he acquired the castle of the Baron, Albert de L'Espée, at Ilbarritz, by Biarritz at auction, and envisaged making a golf course; the 1914 war stopped the works and he transformed the house into a hospital for repatriated injured soldiers during the First World War. He himself served as subalterne/officier d'ordonnance of Gallieni.
Pedro Gailhard had called him to serve in the direction of the Paris Opéra in 1906 and in 1914, he became director of the l'Opéra Comique, alongside Émile and Vincent Isola. He was suddenly removed in 1918 by his sworn enemy Clemenceau. After a short time running the Théâtre Lyrique du Vaudeville (1919–1920), he became editor of "Figaro" and soon was promoted to administrative director. He was especially entrusted by the new proprietor, François Coty, with organizing the merger with "Le Gaulois" in 1929, before leaving in 1932.
In that year Anatole de Monzie, Minister of Public Instruction and Beaux-Arts, nominated him again Director of the Opéra-Comique which was in a financial crisis. Gheusi used his own funds to assist the theatre, but he was forced to resign at the time of the strikes of 1936. 
He died in Paris on 30 January 1943. His memoirs, "Cinquante Ans de Paris", are a precious document on the political life under the Third Républic.

Norrlands dragonregemente

Norrlands dragonregemente (Norrland Dragoon Regiment), also K 4 or K 8, was a Swedish Army cavalry regiment located in the province of Lappland that traces its origins back to the 17th century. It is still in active service as the Norrland Dragoons detachment of Norrbottens Regemente, I19, still located in Arvidsjaur. The current name of the fighting unit is Arméns Jägarbataljon (Swedish Army Ranger Battalion). 
Units from AJB have been involved in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, Pakistan, Ukraina and Tchad (continuously in Afghanistan since 2004).
History.
The regiment has its origin in "Ångermanlands, Medelpads och Jämtlands regemente" raised in 1646. From 1689 on, this regiment was named "Jämtlands dragonregemente", but had only one company of cavalry troops. This company was semi-separate, with the name "Jämtlands kavallerikompani" and had been split off from "Bohus-Jämtlands kavalleriskvadron" in 1670. The company was renamed "Jämtlands hästjägarskvadron" in 1802 and after receiving another squadron it was organized into a battalion and renamed "Jämtlands hästjägarkår" in 1834.
The corps gained full status as a separate unit in 1853 and was given the designation K 8 (8th Cavalry Regiment). It was renamed "Norrlands dragonregemente" in 1892 and when merged with parts of "Kronprinsens husarregemente" in 1927 it was redesignated K 4 but kept its name before being reorganized to a battalion and renamed "Norrlands dragoner" in 1958. Finally the regiment was renamed back to its old name in 1980.

Marketa Lazarová

Marketa Lazarová (1967) is a Czechoslovak historical film directed by František Vláčil. It is an adaptation of the novel "Marketa Lazarová" (1931) by Vladislav Vančura. The movie takes place in an indeterminate time during the Middle Ages, and tells the story of a daughter of a feudal lord who is kidnapped by neighbouring robber knights and becomes a mistress of one of them.
"Marketa Lazarová" was voted the all-time best Czech movie in a prestigious 1998 poll of Czech film critics and publicists.
Theodor Pištěk designed the costumes for the film.
Plot.
The movie opens with two brothers, Mikoláš and one-armed Adam, along with a small group of men, ambushing a wagon and men traveling on a country road in the middle of winter. The attackers massacre most of the travelers, one escapes, Mikoláš chases and captures one and his men capture another. The man who escaped, a Saxon aristocrat, turns out to be the new Bishop of Hennau and a close ally of the local king. The two captives are the Bishop's son and his assistant. When Mikoláš returns to the site of the ambush, he finds a group of scavengers, led by Lazar, a neighbor of Mikoláš's, stripping the dead. Mikoláš' first impulse is to kill Lazar, but spares him after Lazar prays to Christ to forgive Mikoláš. Mikoláš returns to his village where his father, Kozlík, is the clan patriarch. Kozlík becomes furious at Mikoláš for allowing a man to escape, for bringing home two captives and for allowing Lazar to live. When Mikoláš explains that he took the captives for ransom, his father asks him if he intends to travel to Saxony to claim the ransom or if Mikoláš intends to invite the Saxons to bring their army to their small clan village.
In the next scene, Kozlík, chased by wolves, is running through deep snow back to the village. It turns out the king had summoned him to the capital. When Kozlík arrived, the king's captain had attempted to take Kozlík into custody, but Kozlík attacked the captain and fled. The narrator explains the captain was previously a merchant who brewed his own beer. Therefore, people call him Captain Pivo (Beer). The king then orders the Captain to take a regiment to rescue the Bishop's son and to punish Kozlík and his family. Anticipating the attack, the family abandons its village and moves deeper into the forest. As they pack, Mikoláš visits Lazar to request an alliance with him against the king. He suggests the two clans could ambush and massacre the regiment. Marketa now enters the story. She is Lazar's virginal, naïve daughter, destined by her father to become a nun. Marketa is horrified to see her father and his men attack and brutally beat Mikoláš after refusing to ally with him against the king. After beating Mikoláš, Lazar allows him to leave. When Mikoláš arrives home, his father sends a small group of men back to Lazar's to take vengeance against him for beating Mikoláš. When they arrive at Lazar's village, they realize the Captain and his regiment have already arrived. Therefore, they begin to return to Kozlík, but not before killing the Captain's right-hand-man who attempted to single-handedly attack them in a fool-hardy charge.
In the next scene, Lazar and his daughter Marketa visit the nunnery. Lazar has failed to bring the required amount of money to allow Marketa to take vows, so they return home. When they enter the village, they find Mikoláš and his men have captured the village. They kill Lazar's mentally disabled son, kidnap Marketa and nail Lazar in a crucifixion pose to the village door. When Mikoláš and his men return to the family's forest stronghold, Mikoláš rapes Marketa then protects her against his father's attempt to torture her with shoes filled with inward-pointing nails. At the same time, a romance has developed between the Bishop's son, Kristián, who is still a captive, and Kozlík's daughter Alexandra. Earlier in the movie, it was revealed that Alexandra had an affair with her brother Adam. During sex, a viper had bitten Adam's arm and the venom was slowly killing him. This led to Kozlík chopping off his son's arm. By this time in the movie, Alexandra's affections had moved to Kristián who has impregnated her. All of this defiance of Kozlík leads him to chain Mikoláš, Marketa, Alexandra and Kristián together and banish them to the hill outside of the fortress stockade. When the Captain and his regiment arrives at the fortress, Kozlík allows the four back inside. In a series of fragmented flashbacks and flash forwards, the movie reveals that after an initial, ill-considered attack was repulsed, the Captain mounted a second attack which succeeded. Kristián thinks he sees Alexandra killed by dogs. He goes insane and begins to wander the country-side. Marketa attempts to return home, but her father, who survived the attempted crucifixion, rejects her. Mikoláš escapes and Kozlík is taken captive to the king's castle. Marketa reunites with Mikoláš, whom she now loves and who has impregnated her. Alexandra, who actually survived, comes across the insane Kristián who she kills by crushing his head with a rock. The Captain's men find her mourning Kristián's death and arrest her. At the same time, Mikoláš mounts an unsuccessful attempt to free his father from the castle dungeon. Marketa goes to take orders in the nunnery, but leaves during the ceremony to rejoin Mikoláš who is dying from wounds suffered in the ill-fated rescue attempt. The Captain marries Mikoláš and Marketa in an abbreviated ceremony held in the dirt of the castle courtyard. The Captain's men then take Mikoláš and his father Kozlík to their executions. At the end of the movie, Marketa wanders the countryside as the narrator explains that both she and Alexandra had sons. According to the narrator, Marketa nursed both, implying that Alexandra was executed after she gave birth to her son.
Video release.
The film was released by the Criterion Collection in 2012.

Pv loop experiments

Pressure Volume loops are widely used in basic and preclinical research. Left ventricular PV loops are considered to be the gold standard for hemodynamic assessment and are widely used in research to evaluate cardiac performance. While it has long been possible to measure pressure in real time from the left ventricle, measuring the volume was technically more difficult. 
The use of ultrasonic sonomicrometry and the development of the conductance catheter triggered renewed interest in PV loops studies. In sonomicrometry, small ultrasonic transducers (usually referred to as "crystals") transmit signals to each other, and the distance between them is accurately determined based on the transit-time of the signals. By knowing the long and short axis lengths of the ventricle, ventricular volume is easily and accurately determined. Conductance cathethers measure instantaneous conductance in the left ventricle, which is then converted to blood volume using complex formulas and usually after determining and applying various correction factors. Typically only one method is used to perform PV studies in research settings.
The miniaturization of sonomicrometer crystals and pressure catheters have made mice PV loop studies feasible and more common.
Sonomicrometer method.
A sonomicrometer system is composed of an electronic signal-processing unit that is connected to small ultrasonic transducers (crystals). A computer acting as a data acquisition and display device obtains data in real time from the signal processor unit, while the crystals are implanted in or on the left ventrical. As few as 2 or as many as 6 crystals can be used to perform 1-axis, 2-axis, or 3-axis length measurements of the axial planes of the heart, usually at a rate of 200 to 2000 times per second. A typical sonomicrometer system has a resolution of 12 micrometres, enabling high-resolution measurements of the axial lengths. 
Ventricular volume is computed directly (either in micro-liters or milli-liters) by combining the axial length measurements in standard spherical or ellipsoidal volume equations:
formula_1 (for a single-axis measurement)
formula_2 (for a two-axis measurement, where L1 is the length of the long axis)
formula_3 (for a three-axis measurement)
When the axial measurements are acquired in terms of millimeters, then the volume units in these equations will be in terms of milliliters.
Conductance catheter technique.
A conductance catheter contains two or more ring-shaped electrodes along its length. When a high-frequency low-amplitude constant current is passed through the outer electrodes to generate an electric field, the potential difference between any pair of inner electrodes is inversely proportional to the amount of conductive material at that site.
Conductance is defined as the applied current divided by the voltage measured between two adjacent electrodes. 
The conductance catheter technique has no major drawbacks but requires careful calibration of conductance signals. Other techniques exist but this article focuses on the well-established conductance catheter technique.
Theory.
The formula by Baan et al. (1984) for obtaining ventricular volume is as follows: formula_4
where
The conductance measured by the catheter is actually the conductance of the blood and of the surrounding myocardial tissue. This latter conductance is called the parallel conductance (GP).
Calibration and correction.
From the above equation, it can be seen that the volume measurement requires the knowledge of α, ρ, L, and GP.
The equation may be considered to be a straight line of the form y = mx + b, where m (the gain) is a combination of the three terms 1/α, ρ, and L2 and b (the offset) is GP. 
L is available from catheter data sheets, while ρ can be measured directly using appropriate equipment. 
Ideally, gain should be determined in every experiment. While L is known and ρ can be measured, the α factor poses more difficulties. Indeed, the only way to obtain a reliable gain (encompassing α) involves directly measuring cardiac output. Therefore, for most purposes, an educated estimate is used based on values found in the literature. 
To take into account the parallel conductance, GP, the most common method involves injection of hypertonic saline into the subject—enough to temporarily reduce blood resistance, and therefore increase preload, but not so much as to alter haemodynamics. The minimum and maximum volumes (Vmax and Vmin) from each loop in the series of loops are plotted on a graph. Vmax and Vmin lines are extrapolated and at their point of intersection, where Vmax is equal to Vmin, must be zero—conductance is parallel conductance only. The volume at this point is the correction volume.
Admittance techniques offer an alternative to the saline bolus as a means of determining GP.
Parameters.
Several parameters can be calculated for each loop (e.g. end-diastolic pressure, end-systolic pressure, ejection and filling intervals, contractility index, stroke volume, and ejection fraction).
More importantly, other interesting parameters are derived from series of loops obtained under changing conditions. For example, the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) and end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) are derived from series of loops obtained by slowly inflating a balloon to occlude the inferior vena cava, a procedure that reduces cardiac preload.
EDPVR and ESPVR are valuable because they are load-independent indices of left ventricular function. 
They also measure left ventricle Compliance/Stiffness (EDPVR) and Contractility (ESPVR) respectively.
Other parameters derived from series of loops are:

Eleven Caesars

The Eleven Caesars are eleven paintings of half-busts of Roman emperors painted by Titian for Federico II, Duke of Mantua. The original busts were by among Pieve di Cadore's best-known works, inspired by the "Lives of the Caesars" by Suetonius and copied by artists such as Bernardino Campi and Giovan Paolo Lomazzo. The paintings were originally to have been housed in a room devoted to them to plans by Giulio Romano inside the Palazzo Ducale di Mantova. Between 1627 and 1628 the paintings were sold to Charles I of England by Vincenzo II Gonzaga, and when Charles's collection was dissolved during the English Commonwealth the "Eleven Caesars" passed into the collection of the king of Spain. They were lost in a fire at Alcazar near Madrid.
Some works by Giulio Romano, or his workshop, designed to hang below the portraits are in the British Royal Collection.

Ma Liuming

Ma Liuming 马六明 (born 1969 in Huangshi, Hubei province) is a contemporary Chinese painter active in performance art. He is known most of all for his exploration of the power and poetry of public nudity in China, where such behavior was strictly forbidden. That is why he has been the target of government censorship, unable to perform in his own country for most of his career.
In 1981 Ma Liuming started to study oil painting with tutor Cai Erhe. He graduated from Hubei Institute of Fine Arts in 1991 (MFA) in the Oil Painting Department. Two years later, he was one of the founders of Beijing East Village, an artists colony on the outskirts of Beijing. In the early 1990s it became a Mecca for experimental art forms. One of Ma Liuming’s first performances was called ""Fen-Ma Liuming’s Lunch 1"", a collaboration with Zhang Huan and Zhu Ming in 1994. He sat, completely nude, sucking a plastic tube that was attached to his penis. In 1994 Ma Liuming was arrested for a period of two months because of works like this. Many of the artists of the Beijing East Village fled in response to this police action.
In order to match his own uniquely androgynous appearance Ma Liuming developed his own performance persona – Fen-Ma Liuming, a hybrid figure of male and female components.
Next to performances painting is a key component in his works. Since 2000, he has developed his ""Baby series"", in which the face of Fen-Ma Liuming appears on infant’s bodies. It is a surrealistic image that is both disturbing and laughable.
Throughout different mediums such as performance, painting and photography Ma Liuming continues to investigate the limits of provocation, seducing his audience into an inquiry of more intriguing matters.
Fen-Ma Liuming.
Fen-Ma Liuming (芬-马六明) was the name Ma Liuming gave to distinguish his performance from himself. Fen- Maliuming was a transgender creation with woman’s face and dresses but has a man’s body. The initial idea of Fen- Ma Liuming was born in the 1990s when Ma was still an undergraduate in Hubei Academy of Fine Arts. Ma used to wrap his naked body with plastic wrap while modeling for student to do the life drawing, later on, Ma considered this as his first performance.
In 1993, Ma quit his job and moved to the Beijing artists’ colony known as the East Village to start his career as a contemporary Chinese painter and pioneer of Chinese performance art. Although the living condition in the East Village was tough, Ma and his colleagues expressed their passion and creativity to contemporary art during this time period. At the end of Ma’s first year in the East Village, two British visitors came to the village and had huge impact on Ma, perhaps changed the current of his life. The openly gay artistic couple Gilbert and George inspired Ma to turn to performance art as the main medium of his artistic expression.
One night, Ma was persuaded by his friends to wear woman’s make-up and clothes. When the time Ma saw the sight of himself in the mirror, he was shocked. According to his words: "I felt frightened, but also felt that I was ready for a bigger change. So I changed my clothes, and dressed in a girl's long skirt. I had the idea to create art using only make-up and my body." This was the birth of Fen-Ma Liuming.
Since that was the early time period of the 1990s, nude performance was appalling for the public. In 1994, Ma was arrested by police when he was doing the performance in the East Village. During the time Ma was in prison, he became famous in the Chinese contemporary art world and his work- Fen Maliuming was interpreted as a political symbol. After two months, Ma was released and sent back to Beijing.
This event changed Ma’s performing style in a dramatic way. Before his arrest, Fen- Ma Liuming expressed the duality of pleasure with cruelness, and mercy following tragedy. But after Ma was released, the expression of the performance became the concern of the life and society,which is the unsafe and dangerous emotion he had at that time.
In 1996, Fen- Ma Liuming had its first show outside China – 1996 Tokyo International Performance Art Festival. In the darkness of performance hall, Fen-Ma Liuming lit matches one by one to illuminate different parts of his body. When the theatre lights came finally came up, he presented himself fully with a woman's face and a man’s body. According to his own word: "In China, performance art was underground, and the conditions were simple and rough. In art festivals outside China, the partners were professional, and we went over every detail. After talking with some overseas artists, my views and thoughts changed."
After 1996, Fen- Ma Liuming was welcomed by most of performance art festivals and art exhibitions. In the performance in Lyon, France 2001, Ma took some sleeping pills and rendered himself motionless. Then the audiences were invited to come on stage and take photo with Fen- Ma Liuming. The idea of this sleeping version of Fen- Ma Liuming is to blur the boundary between man and woman, self and non-self. The final performance of Fen- Ma Liuming was at the 2002 Asia Performance Art Festival in Fukuoka, Japan. Ma said: "I hope Fen-Ma Liuming will remain in a kind of beautiful permanent, ageless state. But now my body language no longer has the characteristics of Fen-Ma Liuming."

Charles François Jalabert (1819–1901) was a French painter in the academic style. He rapidly gained renown as an artist among Parisian high society in the second half of the 19th century and attended the salon of Madame Sabatier. Some of his works are now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes.
Jalabert was born in Nîmes. One of his most famous works was the oil on canvas painting called "The Plague of Thebes". The painting referred to the Athenian tragedy 'Oedipus Rex' by Sophocles. Thebes is ravaged by plague as a result of the corruption in the place and the murderer of Laius, the former king of the city. The attempts of Oedipus, the incumbent ruler, to allay the plague bring him only to the realization that he is the cause of the plague. His murdering his own father and marrying his mother, he comes to see, is what brought the curse to Thebes. The Plague of Thebes, and other famous works of Jalabert's, like Oedipus and Antigone, are now on display at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes.

Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway

The Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway (P&DR) was a gauge railway, built with the intention of improving the moorland areas around Princetown. In fact granite quarries provided the dominant traffic. The railway was a toll railway (where independent carriers operated horse-drawn wagons and paid the company a toll). It opened in 1823, and a number of short branches were built in the next few years.
The Lee Moor Tramway (LMT) was opened as a branch of the original line in 1856; the extraction of china clay had become an important industry, and the LMT brought the mineral down to processing areas and to shipment at Plymouth. The LMT too operated with horse traction, in conjunction with steam locomotives and rope worked inclines.
The Omen Beam Tramway was an independent tramway for the gathering of peat from the moor above Dartmoor prison, for the manufacturing of naphtha.
The P&DR cost much more than the estimate and the intended generation of agriculture on the moor did not take place. The railway was dominated by a trading company who used it for bringing granite to Plymouth for coastal shipping transport. China clay deposits on Lee Moor were exploited and a branch of the P&DR was built to bring the mineral to Plymouth. The originally P&DR line declined and its upper section was later adopted for a branch line, but the LMT branch, and a short section of the lower end of the P&DR, remained in use until 1960. The line crossed the important Exeter to Plymouth main line on the flat, and many photographs have been circulated depicting the incongruous sight of the horse-drawn wagons crossing the busy main line railway.
Origins.
Conception.
Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt was a substantial and philanthropic landowner in Devon and Cornwall. He had founded the settlement that he called Princetown, on Dartmoor, and he was anxious to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Dartmoor prison had been completed at Princetown in 1809 as a prisoner-of-war detention facility, but the peace following 1815 emptied the prison. Tyrwhitt wished to improve agriculture and extractive industries on Dartmoor, and he conceived the idea of a railway to connect Princetown and Plymouth. This was to bring lime and sea-sand up to the Moor for the improvement of land, together with timber and coal. Granite, peat, mineral products and agricultural produce would be carried down. Goods would be conveyed in wagons drawn by horses, on the turnpike principle, in which all-comers might run their wagons on the railway on payment of a toll.
He put forward proposals at Plymouth Chamber of Commerce in 1818 suggesting an 18% return on capital, and obtained subscribers, and a line was surveyed by William Shillabear of Walkhampton, a schoolmaster and surveyor. William Stuart was the engineer supervising the construction of the Plymouth Breakwater at the time, and this had a primitive internal tramway at the stoneyard. Stuart provided a cost estimate for the construction, and a Parliamentary bill was submitted to form the "Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway", with Stuart as its Engineer. It was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 2 July 1819 with capital of £27,783, authorising it to build from Crabtree to Princetown.
Tyrwhitt ceremonially laid the first rail on 12 August 1819, but in fact contracts had not yet been let for the construction, and some re-appraisal of the engineering of the railway was to intervene. At a Committee meeting on 26 July 1819 Stuart had been instructed to re-survey the line.
Extension to Sutton Pool, and first contracts.
In April 1820, contracts had been let to William Bailey for the supply of cast iron rails; they were to be of the fishbelly pattern 2 ft 10 in (864 mm) long and 6 inches (150 mm) deep; they were to be butt jointed at the supports on stone blocks. The gauge was to be , it is not clear who chose this, or why. A contract for the construction of the formation was let to Hugh McIntosh of London in June 1820, for 9s 3d per yard; it was to be a single line with a number of passing sidings (referred to as "turnouts")—two per mile. Some sidings — at least at Roborough and Yelverton — were to be constructed of granite blocks dressed to as to provide a flange guide, similar to the construction of the main line of the Haytor Granite Tramway.
Alteration to the main route.
On 26 December 1820 the engineer Stuart reported that Shillabear's route as far as Jump (later called Roborough) which ran via Fursdon was too steep for horse traction. He proposed a variation of the route on "Mr Archer's Land" that would reduce the gradient from 22" to 18" in the chain. (From 1 in 36 to 1 in 44; Kendall comments "as opposed to the estimated 1 in 72 maximum".) This required a further revision of the route immediately after obtaining the second Act of Parliament, and after the letting of contracts for construction, and Stuart's report was unwelcome. Some embankment works near Roborough had already been undertaken. The Committee held Stuart responsible and brought in Roger Hopkins as Assistant Engineer. In due course a new route with easier gradients was surveyed and approved; its course ran to the east of the earlier proposed route, but required a tunnel (Leigham Tunnel) and added a further £5,000 to the cost of the line. An Act authorising this was passed on 2 July 1821. The total estimated cost thus became £40,000 and the length 25½ miles (41 km).
The Engineer William Stuart engaged in a dispute with the Committee over responsibility for the route selection, and was dismissed in October 1821. The contractor McIntosh was also dismissed amidst controversy over construction standards in June 1822, and Johnson Brothers (as successor to Johnson & Bryse) took over the work. Hopkins was now in charge as sole Engineer, he modified the specification for the later batch of rails; they were to be 3 ft 10 in (1,168 mm) long, with lapped joints at the sleeper blocks.
Opening, and extensions.
The finances of the Company during the construction phase had been extremely difficult, and work had only been kept going by repeated Exchequer Loans and other financial arrangements. There must therefore have been considerable relief when the line was opened on 26 September 1823 with a celebration breakfast. The opening was between Crabtree and the foot of Kings Tor, Walkhampton.
John and William Johnson were the operators of the quarries at Walkhampton, and the Company soon found that their traffic dominated the income of the line: the hoped-for agricultural and general merchandise traffics had not materialised. Moreover the Company had expended all the capital that they had, and indeed were unable to repay the exchequer loans they had taken out. The extensions to Sutton Pool and to Princetown were therefore carried out by the Johnson Brothers as contractors, and in return they took a mortgage on the Company and were able to offset their tolls against the sums due. In this way the line was completed to Princetown itself in 1826. The Princetown terminus was a few hundred yards east of the later Great Western Railway station.
The Earl of Morley had granted land for the line conditionally upon a branch line being constructed to his quarry in Cann Wood, and he exerted pressure on the Company to comply. However in fact he converted an existing leat into a canal, the Cann Quarry Canal from his quarry to near Marsh Mills, and the Plymouth & Dartmoor Railway built a half-mile branch from near Crabtree to a basin on the canal. These works opened either on 20 November 1829 or 20 January 1830. This required transshipment from canal to the Railway, and boat operation on the fast flowing converted leat was difficult; the branch was extended northwards to Plymbridge mostly on the towpath of the canal, in 1833.
Morley also had interests in the extraction of china clay (a form of kaolinite) at Lee Moor, somewhat to the north-east of Marsh Mills, and he arranged with Johnson Brothers for them to extend the P&DR eastwards from Marsh Mills to Plympton, where the china clay could be brought down a pack horse road from Lee Moor. This opened in 1834. It is not clear whether the railway extension was Morley's property or the Johnsons', but it is generally regarded as being part of the P&DR.
Passengers.
The P&DR was not planned, or authorised, as a passenger railway. However Kendall reports an extract from a "chronicle in diary form compiled by one William Bray, sometime Rector of Tavistock"; approaching King's Tor he found that
Some huts, one a blacksmith's shop now presented themselves, and before this stood a vehicle not much unlike a rude kind of vis-a-vis with an awning. This I had observed passing on with some degree of rapidity before us. I conclude that in these carriages with iron wheels, though as cumbrous and uneasy as the scythed cars of the Britons, many pleasure parties make excursions from Plymouth, for a man accosted me and said that if I wanted to see the works, Mr. Johnson, or Thomson or some such name, would show them to me ...
This seems to be a non sequitur, and it may be that the carriage was simply a stone wagon equipped with boards as seats for the Engineer to view the works on the line.
After opening day.
The original estimate for completion of the line had been £27,783 on which a return of 18% had been foretold. Now that the line was open, £37,000 had been subscribed and £28,000 borrowed from the Exchequer; the Johnson Brothers had negotiated an advantageous rate for their traffic, and any receipts from it would return to them for moneys owing to them; and there seemed to be little general traffic. The dominance of Johnson Brothers traffic is shown by the return of receipts from 26 September 1823 to 5 July 1825:
Now however the Earl of Morley demanded that the commitment of 1821, to connect his Cann Wood Quarry to the line, should be honoured at once. With the Exchequer demanding payment of capital and interest on Exchequer loans, the Company was now in serious trouble.
In desperation, the Company agreed a "reduction" in tolls to the Johnson Brothers in return for an end date to their effective monopoly seven years later; this was agreed in the face of objection from the Exchequer. Lord Morley, seeing the reality of the situation, cut a canal from his quarry down to Marsh Mills, in exchange for low rates. This was actually simply a widening of an existing leat and proved unsatisfactory as a canal. However a branch from the P&DR to Marsh Mills, crossing the River Plym. The branch opened on 20 November 1829 or 20 January 1830
Lord Morley had interests in china clay (kaolinite) deposits on Lee Moor, and in 1833 he agreed with the Johnson Brothers that they would build a branch line to Plympton largely on the northern margin of the Exeter Turnpike. China clay was to be brought down from Lee Moor by packhorse to Plympton. The line was completed by mid 1834 and leased for 75 years to the Johnson Brothers.
The seven year agreement with the Johnson Brothers had given them an effective monopoly of granite transport until 1834, but on expiry of that period no other trader came forward to challenge their established position.
Thomas Tyrwhitt died in 1833; his vision, to generate agricultural development on the moor, had failed. As early as 1825-6, this had been evident to von Oeynhausen and von Dechen, who had made a tour of English railways:
The railway was completed satisfactorily, but the plan for cultivation on Dartmoor has encountered such severe difficulties, that it seems that there is little to show for the effort. Consequently this expensive project has missed its main objective and can only service the interest on the capital outlay with difficulty, as it is limited to the transport of granite alone.
The huge overspend on the originally subscribed capital outlay had been partly funded by Exchequer loans of £28,000; the Administrators periodically pressed the Company for repayment, which the Company could not afford. The line was effectively the private property of the Johnson Brothers and it appears likely that they made some payments on account to prevent premature seizure by the Exchequer.
Johnson Brothers' activity increased with the years; Rachel Evans, writing in 1846 passed the quarries:
An immense excavation presents itself studded with workmen ... some are boring holes in the flinty rock; others are filling the cavities with powder; some are chipping the rude blocks into shape; others are lifting their ponderous weight by cranes and levers; horses, carts and railway waggons, are in constant employment, to convey away the heavy masses of stone, (some twenty feet in length) which have been available in the principal public works, lately carried on in the metropolis: the Post Office and London Bridge, were constructed of this strong material, and at present it is furnished for building the new houses of parliament ... Three hundred men were recently in constant employment on the spot.

The main line descended from Princetown to Crabtree, east of Laira, following a very sinuous course in an attempt to limit the maximum gradient for the uphill haul; extremely small-radius curves were adopted in places to avoid major earthworks.
Priestley, writing in 1831 said
Commencing at Bachelor's Hall in the parish of Lydford, at no great distance from the prison erected for the reception of prisoners of war on Dartmoor, the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway runs in a very circuitous course from north to south by Moortown, Grenofen, Buckland Abbey, Hoo Meavy, and Borringdon to Crabtree in the parish of Egg Buckland, where it crosses the turnpike road from Plymouth to Exeter, and where the original line terminated; from thence, however, its course was continued, under powers granted by subsequent acts, to the sound at Sutton Pool, a short distance south of Plymouth.
From Princetown, where the terminal was intended for general merchandise servicing the small community there, the line ran west, passing between the Foggintor Quarry (to the north) and Swelltor Quarries (to the south, on the promontory formed by King's Tor); it swept round the north of King's Tor and to the west of Ingra Tor, now heading general south past Peekhill and across the western flank of Yennadon Down. South of Dousland there was a sharp turn to head north again, to maintain the contour, passing west to Yelverton where the line passed through the centre of the common. Close to the Roborough road, the line descended southwards curving past Clearbrook, and now with multiple twists the line descended to the west of the Tavistock Road through wooded terrain, before turning west through Leigham Tunnel. Negoitating more twist the line descended to the west of the River Plym to reach a point a little west of Marsh Mills. Here it turned west and followed close to the north bank of the Plym, eventually reaching Crabtree wharf.
On some similar lines a vehicle was provided for the horses to ride on the downhill journey but there is no evidence of this arrangement on the P&DR. The line was single-track and there were frequent passing sidings to enable opposing "trains" to pass one another.
The line was conceived as a toll line, where any carrier might use the line for his own wagons, but the overwhelming dominance of the Johnson Brothers' quarry traffic meant that the main line was effectively their private railway.
The intermediate land was moorland and agricultural upland but there were few significant settlements. Sidings, apparently for general merchandise, were provided at Yelverton and Roborough. Nearing Plymouth, the line ran to a wharf at Crabtree, and the later extension reached both Sutton Harbour and a wharf on the River Plym at Laira; at the time of construction the city had not been built up in those areas.
Branches.
The extension to Marsh Mills was of similar construction, but in generally flatter terrain, and the further extension to Plympton ran on the north margin of the Exeter turnpike road. There was a two-span cast iron bridge at Marsh Mills. When the line was extended again to Cann Quarry, it was laid on the towpath of the erstwhile canal.
At the crossing of the South Devon Railway main line, boards were laid between the rails of the P&DR for the horses to walk on.
Wagons and operation.
The main line had a generally falling gradient, and it was steep enough to require efficient braking. The wagon structure was founded on two main beams 9 feet (2.743 m) long, with the bed formed of 2½ inch (64 mm) planking armoured with longitudinal iron strips. The wheels were cast iron, 29 inches (737 mm) diameter with 4½ inch (114 mm) treads; the wheel treads were conical "so that the diameter close to the flange is 29¾ inches" (756 mm) . The axles were 41½ inches (1,054 mm) apart. The brakes were cast iron and fixed to a long wooden lever, acting on both wheels on the same side. The couplings were connecting links 15 inches (381 mm) long.
There was a mobile crane, mounted on a wagon body; it was capable of lifting loads of 80 cwt (4 tonnes). It was in addition to the fixed cranes.
South Devon Railway.
Crossing at Laira Green.
For some years the P&DR line was the only significant line in the area: but in 1843 the South Devon Railway (SDR) deposited plans for its proposed line from Exeter to Plymouth. When the Bill was presented in the 1844 Parliamentary session, it contained the statement that "Messrs John and William Johnson are in possession of and claim to be entitled as mortgagees or assignees to the said Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway ... " The was the de facto position, and the P&DR proprietors were unable to have the clause containing the words removed. The section from Plympton to the junction near Marsh Mills was sold to the SDR and closed in 1847 to allow them to construct their main line without the necessity of making a crossing of the P&DR. Lord Morley seems to have acquiesced in this; his china clay traffic from Lee Moor used Plympton as a railhead and he may have considered the SDR a more efficient carrier from there to Plymouth.
The SDR obtained powers in the 1846 session to take over the P&DR line between Crabtree and Sutton Pool, but the terms were subject to negotiation, and this proved difficult and slow. At one stage the SDR attempted to install a crossing of the P&DR without agreement:
The progress of this extension was stopped by a dispute between the South Devon Railway Company and the mortgagee in possession of the Dartmoor Railway, a line 24 miles long, constructed in 1820. This railway was crossed on the level at right angles by the South Devon line. The mortgagee not getting the terms he asked from the South Devon Railway, brought immense blocks of granite from his Dartmoor quarries, and deposited them on the line where the South Devon wished to cross. This effectually prevented the railway from proceeding with the line and they soon arranged a compromise, which had the desired effect, the granite blocks being then removed by the mortgagee of the Dartmoor Railway.
This crossing became "the well-known oblique crossing at Laira", although the location was really Laira Green as opposed to Laira Wharf on the River Plym.
The South Devon Railway opened its line to Laira Green on 5 May 1848. The station was immediately on the Exeter side of the Laira crossing, at the turnpike bridge. The completion to Millbay took place on 2 April 1849.
Sutton Pool line sold.
The South Devon Railway was anxious to get rail access to Sutton Pool, and on 23 April 1851 they finalised an agreement with the Johnson Brothers: it transferred ownership to the SDR; the SDR would lay mixed gauge track (broad gauge and 4 ft 6in) to maintain P&DR access to Sutton Pool while giving themselves access from Laira. The Cattewater section (the stub to the wharf on the Plym) was excluded from the arrangement. The triangular junction between the line to Sutton Pool and that to Cattewater had very short radius curves, but this area (referred to as "the Granite Works"), and wharves at Laira, were horse-operated for the first years. Some improvement to the curve was made, and the broad gauge rails opened in May 1853. The SDR obtained an Act on 3 July 1854 authorising the strengthening of the line for locomotive operation, and a deviation near the Granite Works to further ease the curve there.
Tavistock line.
At the time of the South Devon Railway reaching Plymouth, promoters were already proposing a branch line to Tavistock, and after initial uncertainty it was a South Devon and Tavistock Railway (SD&TR) that seized the initiative. On 5 July 1852, the Committee negotiated an agreement with Lord Morley, owner of the china clay extractive works on Lee Moor. The SD&TR agreed to build a branch line to Lee Moor for Morley; in doing so they would acquire the right to take over the P&DR Cann Quarry branch from Marsh Mills, which they needed to build their line. The Lee Moor line "would be at once constructed": presumably entirely on Morley's land no authorising Act was required, but the Company was not yet incorporated.
Work started on building the Lee Moor branch in September 1852: it was to be an intrinsic part of the SD&TR lines, and possibly on the broad gauge. The SD&TR got its authorising Act on 24 July 1854. In August 1854 trial operations on the Lee Moor line were under way, but were suspended following an accident on 4 October 1854. An investigation revealed that the construction of the line was gravely inadequate.
William Phillips (as J & W Phillips) was the lessee of Morley's china clay deposits and had been relying on the completion of the line to get the mineral to Plymouth. After an investigation he undertook, it was plain that the works were unsatisfactory, and an agreement of 5 June 1856 the SD&TR relinquished its interest in the line, and Phillips took over.
The SD&TR opened its line to Tavistock on 21 June 1859, but without taking over any of the P&DR line.
Sutton Pool improvements.
The SDR closed the Laira to Sutton Pool line in 1856 so that it could be rebuilt for locomotive working, implementing the authorisation of 3 July 1854. When it reopened in 1857 the 4 ft 6in gauge and broad gauge lines had been separated between Laira, Prince Rock and Cattewater. In 1869 the obligation on the South Devon Railway (by agreement with Phillips) to maintain the 4 ft 6in gauge access to Sutton Pool lapsed, and on 19 April they introduced locomotive operation, having removed the Dartmoor gauge rails.
Lee Moor Tramway: construction.
There were two inclines, called Cann Wood and Torycombe; they were of the counterbalanced self-acting type. There was a passing loop in the middle of each; above the loop there was a three-rail section, with the middle rail common; below the loop there was a single track. When the ascending and descending cuts crossed at the loop, the descending cut pushed through the points at the lower end of the loop, and they were therefore correctly set for the next ascending cut.
The line ran through Lee Moor village to Cholwichtown, and there was a spur line to Wotter Village (the Wotter Tramway). The original alignment and incline approaching Lee Moor was closed, but part of it was used as a dead-end approach to kilns.
The P&DR from 1865.
An agreement was made on 3 May 1865 to reconstitute the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway Company, with all the preference shares owned by William Johnson. The new company was sufficiently profitable to be able to pay a 0.25% dividend in 1870.
Relaying on the P&DR main line proceeded: 600 tons of new rail were laid in 1873-4.
Princetown Railway.
The transfer took place in 1878: the Princetown Railway paid £22,000 in shares for the necessary part of the line, and it opened on 11 August 1883. The activities of the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway were now confined to the Lee Moor traffic from the point where that line joined; in Plymouth there were interchange arrangements with the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Laira, and a wharf on the Plym, also at Laira.
Turnchapel branch.
On 2 August 1883 the P&DR obtained powers to build a line to Turnchapel; it succeeded in building a bridge over the Plym near Laira road bridge, opened as far as Plymstock (then called Pomphlett) in 1887. The LSWR took over the powers for the branch, and they opened it on 1 January 1897.
Final years of the P&DR.
Towards the end of the nineteenth century the P&DR had lost the quarry traffic from Dartmoor (to the Princetown Railway) and practically all the general merchandise traffic. The Lee Moor line flourished as the trade in the mineral flourished, and the china clay work therefore dominated the residue of the Company. In 1916 the rails on the disused section above Cann Wood were recovered for scrap, and under the Railways Act 1921 the Company was transferred to the new Southern Railway. In practice this referred to the short branches around the Cattewater. The Lee Moor Tramway continued in use, traversing the southern end of the P&DR main line, and the entire section of route from Lee Moor to Laira became colloquially known as the "Lee Moor Tramway".
Lee Moor Tramway in operation.
In 1862 Phillips, having managed all the difficulty of creating the Lee Moor line, sold his china clay business and the lease of the line to Mrs R Martin.
The dominant traffic was china clay downhill to the Cattewater or Laira exchange sidings and stores and coal uphill to Lee Moor. The inclines operated by balancing loaded wagons with empties; at Cann incline five loaded wagons downhill would pull three empties and two loaded wagons up. At Torycombe water tank wagons were kept ready when an unbalanced uphill movement was required.
Increasing volumes of traffic caused to locomotives to be acquired in 1899; they worked the section between the inclines, horses continuing to haul the wagons above and below. Heavier rails were installed ready for locomotive operation.
At Lee Moor there had been short branches to Wotter and Cholwich Town but these closed in 1900 and 1910 respectively.
In 1919 the china clay operation and the Tramway were sold to English China Clays Limited (ECC), and this company became part of English Clays, Lovering Pochin Ltd (ECLP). From 1936 the section above Torycombe incline ceased to be used, and the operating company increasingly installed pipelines to transmit the china clay in slurry form, and also by road.
The last commercial use of the Tramway seems to have been at the end of 1945 and commissioning of a major pipeline from Lee Moor to Marsh Mills in 1947 made the closure irrevocable. The owning company did not wish to relinquish the right of way, however, and token movements carrying sand from Marsh Mills to Maddock's concrete works were made at three-monthly intervals. This continued until the final movement on 26 August 1960, the last time the Lee Moor Tramway horses pulled wagons across the Great Western Railway main line. The trackwork in the main line was removed in October–November.
Omen Beam Tramway.
The peat was processed to produce naphtha, used for making candles and mothballs, and the fibrous material in the peat was used in paper making. Over 30 tons of peat were used daily.
The track rails were spiked direct to wooden sleepers, not stone setts, and fine ballast was laid between the rails for the horses' walkway. The total cost (probably including the works) was £19,000. The total length was 2¾ miles (3.6 km).
When the prison was reopened as a convict prison, the entire building was at first lit using naphtha gas, and in the twentieth century a gas engine ran on the fuel.
The track may easily be seen from the Two Bridges Road east of Rundlestone Corner.
A present-day description and photographs are available on Richard Knight's "Dartmoor Walks" website at and a description of the process of peat processing, and references to the Omen Beam activity are on the "Legendary Dartmoor" website at [http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/peat_moor.htm

Glen Newey

Professor Glen Newey is a political philosopher who is Professor of Political Theory at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. Until 2011 he was Professor in the School of Politics, International Relations & Philosophy at Keele University, Staffordshire, England. He is a prominent member of the "Realist" school of political philosophers which also includes such figures as Bernard Williams, John N. Gray, and Raymond Geuss. Newey has also written extensively about toleration, casting doubt on whether it remains a coherent political ideal in modern liberal-democratic societies. 
Newey blogs regularly for the London Review of Books on a range of topics including UK and overseas politics, university politics, finance and culture, taking a strongly critical stance against free-market capitalism and the marketising of higher education. His journalistic articles are often informal in vein; in one article entitled "As Useful as a String Condom" Newey criticises the British Royal Family as being of no use any more in modern Britain. His journalistic output also includes film and theatre reviews, as well as review essays on political and moral philosophy, and cultural criticism. He is also a strong defender of free speech and of academic freedom.
Background.
Glen Newey was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge where he studied History under the supervision of Richard Tuck. After graduating he worked for several years as a schoolteacher in Jersey. He completed Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees at the University of York, where his doctoral supervisor was Professor John Horton. Before working at Keele University, Newey had taught at the University of Sussex, University of Strathclyde, University of York, Birkbeck College and the University of Oxford.
Area of Specialisation.
Glen Newey's main research interests are in political philosophy. His work focuses on toleration, the nature of politics, political morality, including the ethics of deception in public life, security, freedom of speech, and the political theory of Thomas Hobbes. He argues that modern liberalism, as defended by John Rawls and his followers, sidelines politics in favour of a moralised account of public life. Presently, his work concentrates upon the relationship between security and other political concepts, as well as the nature of politics and the relation between freedom and justice. Political deception is another area of interest. Between 2008 and 2010 he was a research associate at Helsinki Collegium.
Other areas of interest include the concept of security, freedom of speech, Hobbes's political philosophy and the philosophical basis that political systems are built upon. His academic and journalistic output examines liberal views and develops an alternative to them.

Dreams of the City

Dreams of the City or Ahlam al-Madina () ("Dreams of the City") is a Syrian feature drama film by director Mohamed Malas. The story is about a young widow and her two sons are forced to move from their native Quneitra to Damascus, where her brutish father offers little emotional or financial support, forcing all of them to fend for themselves. Against the backdrop of successive military coups that punctuated the turbulent 50s in Syria, Adib, the eldest of the two boys, comes of age in the overwhelming urban magic of Damascus. Images of mosques, the faces of strangers and the greenery that embroiders Damascus swirl by as Adib witnesses each dizzying and violent day in the city.
The film is partially autobiographical, and it marks the emergence of auteur cinema in Syria, and an unsentimental and at times critical look at the lives of the middle classes.

DeJarnette's Tavern, also sometimes called "DeJarnette House", "Daniel DeJarnette Tavern", or "Staunton River Hunt Club", is a nationally registered historic place near Nathalie, Halifax County, Virginia. This wooden structure with stone foundations and chimneys was built in the late eighteenth century, perhaps about 1780, and consists of one and one-half stories, with a supra-attic and cellar. Most of the first floor was occupied by a large tavern room.

Elvira Madigan (film)

Elvira Madigan is a 1967 Swedish film directed by Bo Widerberg, based on the tragedy of the Danish tightrope dancer Hedvig Jensen (born 1867), working under the stage name of Elvira Madigan at her stepfather's travelling circus, who runs away with the deserter Swedish lieutenant Sixten Sparre (born 1854).
Plot.
Elvira Madigan and Sixten Sparre are together in the Danish countryside. Sixten has renounced the military and now claims to be "on the women's side." Elvira, who was the main attraction at her circus, has got her identity back and starts to refer to herself with her real name Hedvig.
A friend from Sixten's regiment tries to persuade him to come back, but fails. They have no money or future and try to fish and earn money the best they can - Hedvig sells a picture of herself drawn by Toulouse-Lautrec and is paid to entertain a party with her tightrope walking. But the situation becomes more desperate, and finally they see death as their only option.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack features Géza Anda playing the Andante from Piano Concerto No. 21 in C by Mozart, which is now popularly known as the "Elvira Madigan" Concerto; as well as Vivaldi's "Four Seasons".
Anda's Deutsche Grammophon LP of Concerto No. 21 was re-issued with a cover showing Pia Degermark in costume in a still from the film.
Critical responses.
An unnamed reviewer in the "Time Out Film Guide" writes: "Candidate for the prettiest pic ever award. ... you may be enchanted by it if you don't laugh yourself sick.". Describing it as breathing the "hippie mid-sixties", Edgardo Cozarinsky writes: "Though the lovers are there as early instances of drop-outs, and several contemporary readings effortlessly emerge, Widerberg's real concern is with the sensuous presence of cream and berry juice on lips and fingertips". For Widerberg, "this affirmation in the face of death carries ... the weight of a modest but combative ideological point".

Territorial Abbey of Montevergine

The Territorial Abbey of Montevergine () is a Roman Catholic territorial abbey located in the commune of Montevergine in the Ecclesiastical province of Benevento in Italy.
About 1120 William of Vercelli founded an abbey of eremitic inspiration dedicated to the Holy Virgin. It was consecrated in 1124 on "Mons Sacer", so called because of the ruins of a temple of Cybele. Catherine of Valois and her son, Louis I of Naples, are buried in the abbey. The new basilica, built in 1961, is home to a 13th-century Byzantine icon of a black Madonna.
In 1926 it was established as the Territorial Abbacy of Montevergine.

Vatican Radio lawsuit

The Vatican Radio lawsuit was started by the Regional Health Department for "Throwing of dangerous things" on the Italian ground. Every time it was sued the radio showed the 'Lateran Treaty', bilateral agreements signed by the Holy See and Benito Mussolini during Fascism. (The area around the radio station at the time it was built was not heavily populated).
The Santa Maria di Galeria transmitter site is the subject of a dispute between the station and some local residents who claim the non-ionising radiation from the site has affected their health. However these claims are not accepted by the station.
Vatican Radio covers a large area of the Rome municipality, as set by the 'extraterritorial right' in Italian law. To cover such a large area, the radio station has around 60 pylons higher than . Since this part of Rome is not under Italian jurisdiction, these transmitters are not subject to the Italian laws that limit the radiation that a radio station can emit. In the vicinity of these pylons, the radiation emitted can be more than the double the amount allowed by Italian law, as verified officially by the Italian Civil Defense and the Department for the Environment of the region of Lazio.
This situation causes much disturbance to the lives of the people living in this area: the most common complaints are that one can hear the transmissions breaking through on telephones, and many other electronic devices (due in many cases to the devices having poor electromagnetic immunity to the strong signals). The Region of Lazio has also found that the people in the area around the emitters are much more likely to have leukemia; the closer those in the examined sample lived to the radio station, the more likely they were to have leukemia, up to six times the Italian national average.
A well known Italian TV program called "Le Iene" went to the radio station and replaced the radio's insignia with a new one stating 'Radio Erode' meaning 'Herod's Radio', referring to Herod the Great and the Massacre of the Innocents, since the studies show that the most affected people are children 0 to 14 years old.

COROT-7b

COROT-7b (previously named COROT-Exo-7b) is an exoplanet orbiting around the star COROT-7, in the constellation Monoceros, at 489 light years from Earth. It was first detected photometrically by the French-led COROT mission and reported in February 2009. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, it was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 times that of the Earth (which would give it a volume 3.95 times Earth's), and the first potential extrasolar terrestrial planet to be found. The planet is also notable for its very short orbital period, revolving around its host star in about 20 hours.
Discovery.
COROT-7b was found by observing its parent star's periodic decrease in apparent magnitude caused by the planet's transit in front of the star as seen from Earth. Measuring this dip in brightness, together with a size estimate for the star, allows one to calculate the planet's size. (See Transit method.) The space mission COROT observed the star COROT-7, in the stellar field LRa01, from 15 October 2007 to 3 March 2008. During this period, 153 periodic transit signals of 1.3 h duration with a depth of 3.4 × 10−4 were registered. After 40 days of data acquisition, the Alarm mode pipeline algorithm detected the shallow signal of COROT-7b, starting the follow-up observations from the ground to get a confirmation of the planetary nature of the transiting object.
The discovery of COROT-7b was announced a year later on 3 February 2009, during the COROT Symposium 2009 in Paris. It was published in a special issue of the journal "Astronomy and Astrophysics" dedicated to results from COROT.
Uncertain mass.
After the detection of COROT-7b in the lightcurve, follow-up observations carried out with a network of ground-based telescopes ruled out nearly completely the possibility of a false positive detection. The HARPS spectrograph was subsequently used to measure the mass of COROT-7b with the radial velocity method. The strong activity of the host star, which perturbates radial velocity measurements, made the mass determination troublesome.
The discovery paper, by Queloz "et al.", weighed the planet at about 4.8 Earth masses, giving it a density of 5.6 ± 1.3 g cm−3, similar to Earth's. The value was obtained using a pre-whitening procedure and harmonic decomposition. It was also inferred that there was a second non-transiting planet in the system, COROT-7c, with a 3.7-day orbital period.
A second paper, by Hatzes "et al.", employing Fourier analysis, reported a likely mass of 6.9 Earth masses for COROT-7b, and found hints for the presence of a third planet in the system, COROT-7d, with mass similar to Neptune's and a 9-day orbital period.
Pont "et al." evidences larger-than-declared systematic errors in the HARPS measurements, weighing COROT-7b between one and four Earth masses. The radial velocity confirmation of the planet is in shaky ground too, with a tentative detection of only 1.2 sigma certainty.
Boisse "et al.", employing simultaneous fitting of stellar activity and planetary signals in the radial velocity data, calculate for COROT-7b a mass of 5.7 Earth masses, though with a very large uncertainty.
The COROT team then published a second paper on COROT-7b's mass, removing stellar activity through analysis only of radial velocity data for which multiple measurements were taken in a given night. The planet is weighed at 7.42 Earth masses, yielding an average density of 10.4 ± 1.8 g cm−3, far higher than the Earth's and similar to that of the second rocky planet found, Kepler-10b.
A last study by Ferraz-Mello "et al." improved the approach used in the discovery paper, finding that it downsized the amplitude of the planets' induced radial velocities. It reports for COROT-7b a heavier mass of 8 Earth masses, in agreement with the second paper published by the COROT team. Thus, CoRoT-7b may be rocky with a large iron core, with an internal structure more like Mercury than Earth.
Spitzer observations.
An independent validation of COROT-7b as a planet is supplied by follow-up performed with the space based Spitzer telescope. Its observations confirmed the transits of the planet, with the same depth, at different wavelengths than the ones observed by COROT. The data then allows to validate COROT-7b as a bona-fide planet with a very high degree of confidence, independently from the noisy radial velocity data.
Characteristics.
While the planetary mass remains uncertain, with a range between 2 and 8 Earth masses, the radius and orbital period of COROT-7b are well constrained from COROT photometry: it orbits very close to its star (1/23rd the distance from the Sun to Mercury) with an orbital period of 20 hours, 29 minutes, and 9.7 seconds and its radius is measured as 1.58 Earth radii. The planet had the shortest orbit ever seen in any planet, extrasolar or otherwise, at the time of discovery.
COROT-7b has a maximum surface temperature between 1800 to 2600 °C (3300 to 4700 degrees Fahrenheit). Due to the high temperature, it may be covered in lava. The composition and density of the planet, though weakly constrained, make COROT-7b a probably rocky planet, like Earth. It could belong to a class of planets that are thought to contain up to 40% water (in the form of ice and/or vapor) in addition to rock. However, the fact that it formed so close to its parent star may mean that it is depleted of volatiles. A strong possibility exists that the planet's rotation is tidally locked to the orbital period, so that temperatures and geologic conditions on the sides of the planet facing towards and away from the star may be dramatically different. Theoretical work suggests that CoRoT-7b could be a chthonian planet (the remains of a Neptune-like planet from which much of the initial mass has been removed due to close proximity to its parent star). Other researchers dispute this, and conclude COROT-7b was always a rocky planet and not the eroded core of a gas or ice giant, due to the young age of the star system.
Any departure from circularity of its orbit (due to the influence of host star and neighboring planets) could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that of Io, via tidal heating.
A detailed study of the extreme properties of COROT-7b has been published, concluding that, despite the mass uncertainty, the planet is Earth-like in composition. The extreme proximity to the star should prevent the formation of a significant atmosphere, with the dayside hemisphere as hot as the tungsten filament of an incandescent bulb, resulting in the formation of a lava ocean. The researchers propose to name this new class of planets, COROT-7b being the first of them, "lava-ocean planets".
Model of the interior.
The uncertainty in COROT-7b mass does not allow precise modelling of the planet structure. Nevertheless, educated guesses could still be put forth. Assuming a 5-Earth-masses planet, the planet was modeled to have convection in the mantle with a small core with no more than 15% the mass of the planet, or 0.7 M⊕. The lower mantle above the core-mantle boundary has more sluggish convection than the upper mantle because the greater pressure causes fluids to become more viscous. The temperature of the upper convecting mantle is different from one side of the planet to the other with lateral temperature differences for downwellings up to several hundred kelvins. However, the temperature of the upwelling is unaffected by downwelling and surface temperature variations. On the permanent dayside of the tidally locked planet where the surface temperature is hot from continuously facing its sun, the surface takes part in convection, which is the evidence that all the surface of this hemisphere being covered in oceans of lava. On the permanent nightside, the surface is cool enough for the formation of the crust with pools of lava above the convective mantle with intense volcanism. The dayside of the planet has larger convection cells than the nightside. Researchers also investigated the physical state of the interior of CoRoT-7b, indicating as likely a solid iron core, thus a self-generated magnetic field should be absent on the planet.
Possible atmosphere.
Due to the high temperatures on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 bar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side in the form of particles of minerals, such as enstatite, corundum and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10 km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.

Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes

The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes is the fine arts museum of Nîmes.
Site.
It was founded in 1821 and originally housed in the Maison Carrée. Since 1907 it has been housed in a building designed by the architect Max Raphel in Square de la Mandragore on rue de la Cité Foulc. The Maison Carrée soon became too small and an architectural competition was organised in 1902 for a new building. This was won by Max Raphel and work began in 1903, being completed in 1907. It was renovated by the architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte in 1987
Collections.
The original collection was gathered from private collections in 1824 and was mainly made up of Roman antiquities, old master paintings and modern paintings. It was later enriched by legacies such as those of Robert Gower in 1869 and of Charles Tur in 1948 and gifts by professional and amateur artists. The collection now includes 3,600 works. In a lower 3-room gallery are Italian paintings by Jacopo Bassano (1515–1592), Lelio Orsi (1511–1587) and Andrea della Robbia (1435–1525) among others. In the seven rooms of the upper gallery are Flemish and Dutch paintings of the 16th and 17th centuries (Rubens, Carel Fabritius, Pieter van Aelst (1502–1550), Leonaert Bramer) and French paintings by Renaud Levieux, Jean-François de Troy, Pierre Subleyras and Paul Delaroche's "Oliver Cromwell with the corpse of Charles I". They also house paintings by the Nîmes-born artists Charles-Joseph Natoire and Xavier Sigalon.

Jean-Michel Wilmotte

Jean-Michel Wilmotte (Born in Soissons (Picardy) in 1948) is a French architect.
Biography.
Jean-Michel Wilmotte studied interior design at the Camondo school of interior design in Paris. Just two years after graduating, he founded his own agency in Paris in 1975. His style influenced a number of personalities including François Mitterrand, who asked him to design part of his private apartments in the Elysée Palace in 1982. Soon after, the mayor of Nimes, Jean Bousquet, commissioned the redevelopment of the city hall and the Museum of Fine Arts.
Jean-Michel Wilmotte earned his degree in architecture in 1993, allowing him to work on large scale and to develop the concept of "interior design of cities", while maintaining the same attention to the use of "noble materials and extreme attention to finishes" notable in his smaller scaled works.
Over the years, the agency has diversified and operates primarily in five key areas: architecture, interior design, museology, urbanism and design. An attention to details allows Jean-Michel Wilmotte and his team to work from the smallest to the largest scale: moving from a house to a skyscraper, from a shop to a corporate headquarters, from a gallery of art to a museum, and from street furnitures to urban design. Currently the agency Wilmotte & Associates has 185 employees from 40 different origins. It has now taken a clear international and multicultural dimension, with projects in over twenty countries around the world. The Firm is now established in four locations in Paris, one in Sophia-Antipolis, one in London and one in Seoul.
In 2005, the Wilmotte Foundation was created to promote the urban graft through the W Prize, with the goal of helping and encouraging young architects. In 2010, according to a study by UK magazine Building Design, the agency is listed in the world ranking of the 100 largest architecture firms, holding the 73rd spot in 2011.

Joe Ades

Joseph “Joe” Ades () (18 December 1934–February 1, 2009), also known as the “Gentleman Peeler,” was a well-known street potato peeler seller in New York City, USA.
Early life.
Joseph Ades, the youngest of seven children, was born in Manchester, England, where his father worked in the textile industry. Leaving school at 15, he became an office boy before becoming intrigued by the local markets that would spring-up in the World War II–devastated landscapes of Northern England. He started out hawking comic books before selling linens, textiles, jewelry, and toys directly on the streets.
Australia.
In 1956 he married Shirley, and they had three children. The family moved to Australia in 1969 as Ten Pound Poms, where they settled in Sydney, where Ades tried to set up markets in the parking lots of drive-in movies. Eventually he sold goods at street fairs off of the back of a large truck. After the marriage to Shirley dissolved in 1980, Ades remarried and divorced again.
While married to his third wife, she gave him a copy of "London Labour and the London Poor" by Henry Mayhew, a contemporary of Charles Dickens, which recorded the activities of the street sellers of the Victorian period. Ades modeled himself on what Mayhew called “the patterers,” most of whom liked to ape the dress and mannerisms of the gentleman.
New York City.
After the breakup of his third marriage, and a period of residence in Ireland, Ades followed his daughter to New York City, taking up residence in Manhattan.
From 1993 onward, Ades sold $5 Swiss-made metal potato peelers. Known for his engaging sales patter and demonstrations in places such as Union Square Greenmarket, while wearing $1,000 Chester Barrie suits and shirts from Turnbull & Asser. Ades never bothered with a license, meaning that he was often moved on by the New York City Police Department. His pitches and lifestyle eventually meant that he became so famous that he was the subject of a "Vanity Fair" article series.
Ades sold enough peelers to enjoy café society at the Pierre Hotel, on the Upper East Side, and lived with his fourth wife, Estelle Pascoe–November 17, 2007) in her three-bedroom apartment on Park Avenue.
Ades died on February 1, 2009, only a day after being informed that he had been granted American citizenship.
Legacy.
Ades was survived by his daughter and two sons from his first marriage. His daughter, Ruth Ades-Laurent, began selling the peelers in the same spots as her father, but was later forbidden from selling in Union Square.

Auguste Clésinger

Auguste Clésinger (Jean-Baptiste Auguste Clésinger; 22 October 1814 – 5 January 1883) was a 19th-century French sculptor and painter.
Life.
Auguste Clésinger was born in Besançon, in the Doubs department of France. His father, Georges-Philippe, was a sculptor and trained Auguste in art. Auguste first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1843 with a bust of vicomte Jules de Valdahon and last exhibited there in 1864. At the 1847 Salon, he created a sensation with his "Woman bitten by a serpent", produced from life-casts from his model Apollonie Sabatier (the pose being particularly suitable for such a method), thus reinforcing the scandal with an erotic dimension. Appolonie Sabatier was a salonnière and the mistress of Charles Baudelaire and others. The sculpture's beauty was praised by Théophile Gautier:
Clésinger also portrayed Sabatier as herself, in an 1847 marble sculpture now in the Musée d'Orsay.
He produced busts of Rachel Félix and of Théophile Gautier, and a statue of Louise of Savoy (now in the Jardin du Luxembourg). He received the knight's cross of the Légion d'honneur in 1849 and rose to an officer of the order in 1864. In 1847, he married George Sand's daughter, Solange Dudevant. In 1849, the couple had a daughter, Jeanne, nicknamed "Nini", who died in 1855 shortly after her parents' separation. 
At the death of the composer-pianist Frédéric Chopin on 17 October 1849, Clésinger made Chopin's death mask and a cast of his hands. He also sculpted, in 1850, the white marble funerary monument of "Euterpe", the muse of music, for Chopin's grave at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, in Paris. 
Clésinger died in Paris on 5 January 1883. He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery (division 10). His heir was his model and mistress Berthe de Courrière.
Selected works.
Biblical art.
He produced life-size statues for the side chapels of the Église de la Madeleine in Besançon, of the Via Dolorosa, the Pietà, the Entombment, the Resurrection and ascension.

Territorial Abbey of Monte Oliveto Maggiore

The Abbey of Monte Oliveto Maggiore is a large Benedictine monastery in the Italian region of Tuscany, 10 km south of Asciano. Its buildings, which are mostly of red brick, are conspicuous against the grey clayey and sandy soil—the "Crete senesi" which give this area of Tuscany its name. 
It is a territorial abbey whose abbot functions as the bishop of the land within the abbey's possession, even though he is not consecrated as a bishop.
It is the mother-house of the Olivetans and the monastery later took the name of "Monte Oliveto Maggiore" ("the greater") to distinguish it from successive foundations at Florence, San Gimignano, Naples and elsewhere.
History.
It was founded in 1313 by Bernardo Tolomei, a jurist from one of the most outstanding families in Siena. In 1319 or 1320 it was approved by Bishop Guido Tarlati as "Monte Oliveto", with reference to the Mount of Olives and in honour of Christ’s Passion. The monastery was begun in 1320, the new congregation being approved by Pope Clement VI in 1344. 
The abbey was for centuries one of the main land possessors in the Siena region.
On January 18, 1765, the monastery was made the seat of the Territorial Abbacy of Monte Oliveto Maggiore.
Overview.
Interior.
The monastery is accessed through a drawbridge which leads to a medieval palace in red brickwork, surmounted by a massive quadrangular tower with barbicans and merlons. This edifice was begun in 1393 as the fortified gate of the complex; it was completed in 1526 and restored in the 19th century. Over the entrance arch is a terracotta depicting "Madonna with Child and Two Angels" attributed to the Della Robbia family, as well as the "St. Benedict Blessing" nearby.
After the entrance structure is a long alley with cypresses, sided by the botanical garden of the old pharmacy (destroyed in 1896) a cistern from 1533. At the alley's end is the bell tower, in Romanesque-Gothic style, and the apse of the church, which has a Gothic façade.
"Chiostro Grande".
The "Chiostro Grande" ("Great Cloister") has a rectangular plan and was realized between 1426 and 1443. On the oldest side it has a two-storey loggia and a pit, dating to 1439. Under the vaults of the cloister are frescoes of the "Life of St. Benedict" painted by Luca Signorelli and il Sodoma, considered amongst the most important Renaissance artworks in Italy.
The frescoes disposition follows St. Gregory's account of Benedict's life. Signorelli's paintings were executed in 1497-98, while Sodoma's date to 1505 afterwards.
The church.
The church entrance is preceded, in the "Chiostro Grande", by a frescoes with "Jesus Carrying the Cross", "Jesus at the Column" and "St. Benedict Giving the Rule to the Founders of Monte Oliveto", also by Sodoma. The church's atrium is on the site of a previous church (1319), showing on the walls frescoes with "Father Hermits in the Desert" and "St. Benedict's miracle", both by an unknown Sienese artists. In a niche is the "Madonna with Child Enthroned" by Fra Giovanni da Verona.
The church as nave on the Latin cross plan, with a luminous interior. It was renovated in Baroque style in 1772 by Giovanni Antinori. The main attraction is the wooden inlaid choir by Giovanni da Verona, executed in 1503-1505. It is one of the most outstanding examples of tarsia in Europe. The church houses also a canvas by Jacopo Ligozzi ("Assumption", 1598), behind the high altar, and a 14th-century polychrome wooden "Crucifix", in the Sacrament Chapel. The sacristy has an inlaid ceiling dating to 1417.
"Chiostro di Mezzo".
Che "Chiostro di Mezzo" ("Middle Cloister") was built in the 15th century, surrounded by a portico with octagonal pilasters. Artworks include a 15th-century "Madonna with Child and Angels" and "Annunciation" by Riccio. Nearby is the entrance to the refectory, decorated by frescoes by Fra Paolo Novelli (1670) and, in the end wall, a canvas of the "Last Supper" by Lino Dinetto (1948).
Library and Pharmacy.
The stairs leading to the first floor are decorated by Sodoma's fresco depicting the "Coronation of Mary" and one by an unknown artist of the "Deposition". Antonio Muller (an artist from Danzig) executed in 1631 a "Characters and Events of the Olivetani", while by Giovanni da Verona is a wooden candelabrum (1502). The latter artist was also author of the library, which has a basilica plan with a nave and two aisles divided by columns with Corinthian capitals (1518). Nearby is the Monastic Library, housing some 40,000 volumes and incunabula. From the library is the access to the Pharmacy, housing, in 17th century vases, a collection of medicinal herbs.
"Definitorio".
The name "Definitorio" refers to the Capitular Hall (1498), on whose end wall is a fresco of "Madonna with Child and Saints" by Matteo Ripanda (16th century); the hall houses a small museum of Sacred Arts, with works by Segna di Bonaventura ("Madonna with Child"), the Master of Monte Oliveto ("Maestà"), Neroccio di Bartolomeo ("St. Bernardino"), Vincenzo Tamagni ("Madonna with Child") and a fresco portraying "St. Sebastian" by an artist of the Sienese School.

<doc id="21379657" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21379657" title="Guaranteed Education Tuition Program">
Guaranteed Education Tuition Program

The Guaranteed Education Tuition Program, or GET Program, is a 529 savings plan administered by the U.S. state of Washington for residents of the state. As with any 529 plan, account owners invest in the program on behalf of a beneficiary – typically the owner's child or grandchild – in order to prepay for expenses associated with the beneficiary attending a higher education institution.
Overview.
The GET Program is a prepaid 529 plan, and accounts may only be opened by, or on behalf of, residents of the state of Washington. The value of an account is dictated by the quantity of "units" purchased. Units have a purchase value and a payout value which are subject to increase yearly. The U.S. dollar payout value of one unit is always equal to one percent of the annual full-time, undergraduate, in-state tuition and state-mandated fees at the most expensive public university in the state – either the University of Washington or Washington State University. Currently, as of February 2013, the purchase price of one unit is substantially higher than the payout value: $172 vs $117.82, respectively. This premium over current tuition provides financial stability for the program, since tuition is guaranteed in the future, regardless of how much it increases. For example, tuition has had double-digit increases in each of the past four years. This purchase:payout price ratio has risen from previously more favorable levels in the past. In 2007 the purchase price was $70 per unit while the payout price was $59, for a ratio of only 1.19. To see financial gain, GET units should be held for at least 4-5 years. GET is a long term program of particular benefit to families with young children. 
Use of the funds invested in GET are restricted to tuition and other expenses associated with higher education (e.g., room and board, books, mandatory fees). Units purchased must be retained for a minimum of two years before they can be used. Investments are not tax-deductible; however, the increase in account value over time, as well as disbursements to pay for higher-education expenses, are both tax-free. Disbursements for purposes other than to pay for higher-education expenses are subject to income taxes and/or penalties imposed by both the program and the Internal Revenue Service; exceptions are made for certain circumstances such as the death of the beneficiary or the beneficiary receiving a scholarship, in which case income tax is still imposed but penalties are not. 
Accounts may only be opened by, or on behalf of, Washington residents; however, disbursements from the program may be made to any higher education institution in the United States, as well as some foreign institutions, that participate in financial aid programs through the United States Department of Education. Accounts have the same monetary value wherever they are used. Accounts are fully transferable to other relatives of the initial beneficiary. Contributions may be made in lump sum or regular payments may be made on a custom monthly plan. The Account Owner retains full control of the account. 
Investments in the program are backed by the state; i.e., the state assumes all investment risk and guarantees that returns on investments will keep pace with inflation and increases in college tuition over time. The program currently does not receive any appropriations from the state; however, per state law RCW 28B.95.050, the state is required to provide funding in the event that the program's available funds are insufficient to cover its payout obligations.

Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'archéologie de Besançon

The Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'archéologie (Museum of Fine Arts and Archeology) in the French city of Besançon is the oldest public museum in France. It was set up in 1694, nearly a century before the Louvre became a public museum.
Collections.
The collections of the Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'archéologie de Besançon are divided in three categories: archaeology, painting, and drawing cabinet.
Painting.
The collections shows the main tendencies and evolutions of European art from the 14th to 20th centuries: 
Origin of the collections.
The collections of the museum mostly originated in four gifts. In 1694, Abbot Boisot gave his collection (manuscripts, printed books, medals, eleven paintings and four busts coming from the Granvelle family) to the town's Benidictine monks, on the condition that the public had access to these collections twice a week. This "bibliothèque-musée Boisot" (Boisot Library-Museum) lasted for the whole of the 18th century. In 1819 Pierre-Adrien Pâris, the King's architect, added his collection (38 paintings and 183 drawings including those of Fragonard). Jean Gigoux gave the museum his collection in 1894 (over 3000 drawings and 460 paintings of Spanish, English, Northern and German schools), and finally George Besson and his wife gave the museum their collection in 1960 (112 paintings and 220 modern and contemporary drawings).
Building.
Since 1843, the museum has been located in a former grain hall, in the center of the town. The building became too small following Besson's donation, it was rebuilt from 1967 to 1970 by Louis Miquel, a student of Le Corbusier. The interior courtyard was covered with a concrete structure.

Marie Anne de Bourbon (1697–1741)

Marie Anne de Bourbon (Marie Anne; 16 October 1697 – 11 August 1741) was a French noblewoman, the daughter of Louis III, Prince of Condé. Her father was the grandson of "le Grand Condé" and her mother, Louise Françoise de Bourbon, "Mademoiselle de Nantes", was the eldest surviving daughter of Louis XIV of France and his "maîtresse-en-titre", Madame de Montespan. She was known as "Mademoiselle de Clermont".
Biography.
The fourth daughter and the fifth child of her parents, she shared her name with her eldest sister, Marie Anne Éléonore. Her eldest sister was mentally retarded and as such was hidden from the court.
She was born at the Hôtel de Condé in Paris and was baptised there on 29 August 1700. Marie Anne also shared her name with an aunt, Marie Anne, who became the Duchess of Vendôme after her marriage to Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme in 1710.
Marie Anne was said to have been the fruit of her mother's affair with François Louis, Prince of Conti. Her mother, who had an amorous nature, had been having an affair with the prince in the time leading up to the birth of Marie-Anne. François Louis's wife, Marie Thérèse de Bourbon, was the sister of Marie-Anne's mother's husband. Together, the Conti couple had been the titular monarchs of Poland during the year of Marie-Anne's birth.
Her first cousin, Marie Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans (1695–1719), married Charles de France, "duc de Berry" in 1710. Upon her marriage, Marie Louise Élisabeth assumed the rank of "Granddaughter of France" and became entitled to her own household. Marie Anne was chosen to be one of her ladies-in-waiting. After the death of her husband, Marie Louise Élisabeth led a life of debauchery at the Palais du Luxembourg and the Château de La Muette. Her numerous lovers and repeated pregnancies soon gave her the reputation of a Messalina. These libertine scandals made a frustrated Marie Anne to resign her post.
Marie Anne secretly married her lover, the Duke of Joyeuse, in 1719. Her husband, Louis de Melun, was the son of the Prince of Epinoy and a princess from Lorraine. Louis was also a great great grandson of Gabrielle d'Estrées. He was married to Armande de La Tour d'Auvergne, a daughter of the Duke of Bouillon and grand daughter of Marie Anne Mancini (she died in 1717). In 1724, during a hunting party at Marie Anne's ancestral home, the Château de Chantilly, Louis disappeared and his body was never found. Naturally distraught, Marie Anne never married again. She was never to have any children.
In 1725, she was put in charge of the household of the new Polish-born queen, Marie Leszczyńska. She was secured this post thanks to her brother Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon who had helped secure the marriage of Marie Leszczyńska to Louis XV. At the death of her cousin Louise Diane d'Orléans in 1736 after a difficult childbirth (the child was a stillborn), Marie Anne was asked to go to the Château d'Issy to represent the Queen in honour of Louise Diane's early death.
Marie Anne held her post until her death in 1741. She died of inflamed bowels at the "hôtel du Petit Luxembourg". Like her sisters, Louise Anne and Élisabeth Alexandrine, she was buried in the Carmelite Convent of the "Faubourg Saint-Jacques" in Paris.
Her portrait "en Sultane", by Jean-Marc Nattier (1733), "justifying her chic state of undress" (Wallace Collection, London) is a famous example of "turquerie".

Part of the NFB's "Canada Carries On" series, "The Romance of Transportation in Canada" marked the NFB’s first major foray into industrial animation, influenced not by the auteur style of NFB animation studio founder Norman McLaren, but by the United Productions of America (UPA) style.
Canadian film critic Tom Waugh has also noted that the film's commentary -- written and narrated by McLaren's lover, Guy Glover -- features "a high camp commentary" with "very queer inflections."
Awards.
"The Romance of Transportation in Canada" received a special BAFTA Award, the Short Film Palme d'Or for animation at Cannes Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award for Animated Short Film nomination. It was the NFB's first film to be nominated for an Oscar in the animation category, at the 25th Academy Awards as well as the first international nomination in this category. Norman McLaren's pixilation film "Neighbours" won an Academy Award the same year, and was nominated for another, but these were both in live-action categories.

Berthe de Courrière

Berthe de Courrière (June 1852, Lille – 14 June 1916, Paris) was a French artists' model and "demimondaine". She was the mistress, model, and heir of the sculptor and painter Auguste Clésinger.
Life.
Born Caroline Louise Victoire Courrière, she set out for Paris at age 20 and first became the mistress of General Georges Boulanger and several ministers. The sculptor Auguste Clésinger, an intimate friend of George Sand, remarked on Courrière's full form and gigantic proportions, bringing her the nicknames "la grande dame" ("the big woman") or "Berthe aux grands pieds" ("Bigfoot Bertha"). She was his model for the bust of Marianne for the Sénat as well as for the colossal statue of the Republic for the 1878 Exposition Universelle. On Clésinger's death, in 1883, Berthe was his sole heiress and found herself with a large fortune.
In 1886, she met Remy de Gourmont, then making his literary debut, and commissioned from him a study on Clésinger. She became Gourmont's mistress and muse. Gourmont lived with her, at first on rue de Varenne then at number 71 rue des Saints-Pères, until his death in 1915. She died in 1916 and was laid to rest beside him in Clésinger's vault at the cimetière du Père-Lachaise. Gourmont's passionate letters to her over 1887 were published together in one volume as "Lettres à Sixtine" (1921).
In popular culture.
She was the heroine of "Sixtine, roman de la vie cérébrale" (1890) then of "Le Fantôme" (1893).

Advance–decline line

The advance–decline line is a stock market technical indicator used by speculators to measure the number of individual stocks participating in a market rise or fall. As price changes of large stocks can have a disproportionate effect on capitalization weighted stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the NYSE Composite Index, and the NASDAQ Composite index, it can be useful to know how broadly this movement extends into the larger universe of smaller stocks. Since market indexes represent a group of stocks, they do not present the whole picture of the trading day and the performance of the market during this day. Though the market indices give an idea about what has happened during the trading day, advance/decline numbers give an idea about the individual performance of particular stocks.
The advance–decline line is a plot of the cumulative sum of the daily difference between the number of issues advancing and the number of issues declining in a particular stock market index. Thus it moves up when the index contains more advancing than declining issues, and moves down when there are more declining than advancing issues. The formula for ADL is:
The Advance/Decline Line formula could be applied to volume of the advancing and declining stocks. 
The ADL is one of the oldest indicators based on the Advance-Decline Data and it was the most popular of all internal indicators.
Divergence.
"Divergence" is when the stock market index moves in one direction while the ADL on that index moves in the opposite direction. If the index moves up while the ADL moves down, the index may be misleading about the true direction of the overall market, as happened toward the end of the US Dot-com bubble in 1999–2000, when the indices continued to rally while the ADL diverged downward starting at the beginning of 1999. Such negative divergence was also seen toward the end of the roaring twenties bull market, during 1972 at the height of the Nifty Fifty market, and starting in March 2008 before the late-2008 market collapse.
Advance–decline numbers application.
There may be cases in which an index reports a gain at the end of the trading day. This gain may be caused by an increase in a certain number of stocks. However, a significant lead by declining stocks may be observed relative to the advancing stocks.
However, these results should be interpreted as a decline in the market, no matter that the index has experienced an increase. Therefore, you should base your judgments regarding the performance of the market on the advance/decline numbers, not on the performance of a particular index no matter how broad it is.
There have been many cases in which a major increase in an index was not accompanied by an increase in the advance number. In such a case it is reasonable to conclude that by the end of the trading day the index will decline.
The reverse is also true. For instance, if there is a significant movement in the advance/decline numbers, you can expect a movement in the different indexes as well.
Additionally, a market that experiences a trend toward either a decline or an advance is highly unlikely to reverse its movement immediately on the next trading day.
Advance–decline numbers can be also used in your daily observations of the trades to determine whether a particular trend is a false or a spot.
Finally, use advance–decline numbers whenever you need to make a judgment on the performance of the market. These numbers can also give you understanding on the movements of the indexes.

Citroën DS Inside

The Citroën DS Inside is a concept car which was unveiled by Citroën on February 5, 2009 at the Geneva Motor Show. It is a prefiguration of the new luxury DS ("Different Spirit") range of Citroën. The range will include three models, the first one, the Citroën DS3, is sold from May 2010 and it is derived from the DS Inside.
This range of vehicle will share no common feature with and be in no way the successor of the legendary Citroën DS.
The DS Inside (and therefore the production DS3) is a concept of a luxury compact car which would compete against the Mini and the Alfa Romeo MiTo.
