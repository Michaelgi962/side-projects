Dale Roberts (baseball)

Dale Roberts (April 12, 1942 – October 8, 2010) was an American relief pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the New York Yankees in the 1967 season. Listed at , , Roberts batted right-handed and threw left-handed. He was nicknamed ″Mountain Man″. 
Early life.
Born in Owenton, Kentucky, Roberts was the son of Clarence A. and Julie E. Roberts (née Etherington). After graduating from Versailles High School, he served in the United States Naval Air Forces to a term of four and a half years.
Career.
Roberts was signed by the Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1963, and initially assigned to the Harlan Yankees of the Appalachian League, a Rookie-class league. After pitching in 21 games, all but one as a relief pitcher, and a 4–3 record, he was promoted to the Shelby Colonels/Yankees of the class-A Western Carolinas League, and pitched in an additional two games, both of which he was credited with the loss. In 1964, he remained with the Shelby team, and pitched in 47 games while having a 3.53 ERA. For the 1965 season, he was assigned to the Binghamton Triplets of the class-A New York – Penn League. In 112 innings pitched in 45 appearances, he had a 6–4 record and a 3.21 ERA.
In 1966, Roberts was transferred to another class-A team, the Greensboro Yankees of the Carolina League. After appearing in 35 games for Greensboro, and having a 6–4 record and a 2.21 ERA, he was promoted the class-AAA Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. The Yankees switched affiliations for the 1967 season from the Mud Hens to the Syracuse Chiefs, also of the International League, and Roberts moved as well. For Syracuse, he had a 9–4 record and 2.97 ERA in 50 games pitched, when he was a late-season call-up by the Yankees to their Major League club. He appeared in two games for the Yankees; the first one occurred on September 9, when he pitched the final inning in a 7–1 loss to the Boston Red Sox, allowing one run on two hits and one base on balls. His second and last Major League appearance occurred on September 16, when he pitched the eighth inning in a 6–1 loss against the Cleveland Indians, and gave up one run on one hit, one intentional base on balls, and two hit batters. Roberts did not appear in another game for the Yankees, who traded him on December 7, 1967, along with Bob Tillman, to the Atlanta Braves for Bobby Cox.
His first assignment in the Braves organization began with the Shreveport Braves, a class-AA team in the Texas League. Toward the end of the season, Roberts was promoted to the Braves' class-AAA team, the Richmond Braves of the International League, and had a 1.93 ERA in eight appearances. He returned to Shreveport in 1969, and played the entire season with the club, appeared in 61 games, had a 2.29 ERA, and collected 14 saves. In 1970, his last season in professional baseball, Roberts began the season in Shreveport, made 33 appearances, and while his ERA was a low 2.80, he was moved to the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), the class-AAA affiliate of the California Angels. He played in four games with the Islanders before being moved again, landing with the Eugene Emeralds, also of the PCL. He retired after when the season was completed.
Personal life.
After his playing days, Roberts worked as an industrial electrician for several companies, including Texas Instruments and Osram Sylvania. On October 8, 2010, he died in Lexington, Kentucky, aged 68, at Chandler Medical Center located on the campus of University of Kentucky. He was survived by a daughter, two granddaughters, three brothers, and a sister.

List of national parks of the United States

The United States has 59 protected areas known as national parks, which are operated by the National Park Service, an agency of the Department of the Interior. National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress. The first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Many current National Parks had been previously protected as National Monuments by the President under the Antiquities Act before being upgraded by Congress. Seven national parks (six in Alaska) are paired with a National Preserve. While administered together, they are considered as separate units and their areas are not included in the figures below. The newest national park is Pinnacles National Park, upgraded in 2013.
Criteria for the selection of National Parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (though these criteria are not always considered together). National Monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance.
Twenty-seven states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the United States Virgin Islands. California has the most (nine), followed by Alaska (eight), Utah (five), and Colorado (four). The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over , it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Hot Springs, Arkansas, at less than . The total area protected by national parks is approximately , for an average of but a median of only . The most-visited national park is Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee, with over nine million visitors in 2011, followed by Arizona's Grand Canyon, with over four million. In contrast, only 5,227 people visited the remote Lake Clark in Alaska in the same year. Fourteen national parks are designated World Heritage Sites.
A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been abandoned. Other units of the National Park Service are sometimes incorrectly referred to as national parks; they are listed here.

Rubik's 360

Rubik's 360 is a 3-D mechanical puzzle released in 2009 by Ernő Rubik, the inventor of Rubik's Cube. Rubik's 360 was introduced on February 5, 2009 at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair ahead of its worldwide release in August.
The puzzle involves changing the position of six balls, each a different color, in a central sphere to six color-coded compartments in the outer sphere. This is done by maneuvering them through a middle sphere that only has two holes. There are three spheres that make up the puzzle. The puzzle begins with all 6 balls in the center; solving the puzzle involves getting the balls into the outer sphere. Unlike the original Rubik's Cube, there seem to be no algorithms and, in general, less mathematics associated with this puzzle. In addition there is a factor of manual dexterity involved in the solution that was unnecessary with the original cube.
Like Rubik's Cube, Rubik's 360 has only one solution, but it cannot be solved by being broken apart. It is considered suitable for all ages and according to first reviews it is very addictive and engaging.
The unofficial world record for solving this puzzle at a competition is 37.02 seconds, a record held by Martin Smith of the UK.

Isaac Ferdinand Quinby

Isaac Ferdinand Quinby (January 29, 1821-September 18, 1891) was a U.S. soldier and Union general during the American Civil War.
Biography.
He was born near Morristown, New Jersey in 1821. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated in 1843, ranking 6 out of 39 classmates. His early service in the army was with the 2nd U.S. Artillery and later during the Mexican War he served in the 3rd U.S. Artillery. In 1852 he resigned from the army and moved to New York where he became professor of math and philosophy at Rochester University.
When the Civil War began in 1861, Quinby was appointed colonel of the 13th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He led his regiment into action at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861. In August that year he resigned from the army but on March, 17, 1862 was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and sent to the Western Theater of the Western Theater to command the Sub-district of Columbus. Shortly after his arrival in the West he was placed in command of the District of Mississippi where forces under his command captured Fort Pillow on May 22, 1862. After commanding various other districts, Quinby was placed in command of the 7th Division, XIII Corps. This division eventually became the 7th Division of James B. McPherson’s XVII Corps.
In March 1863 Admiral David D. Porter and General Leonard F. Ross led the Yazoo Pass Expedition against Confederate-held Fort Pemberton. After the expedition had departed, Quinby’s division was sent out as reinforcements. Quinby met Ross and Porter on March 20 and learned the expedition had failed but convinced them to return and try again. The continuation resulted in two more unsuccessful artillery duels and the expedition ended for good on April 5. During the expedition Quinby became ill and took a leave of absence and General Marcellus M. Crocker assumed command of the 7th Division. Having recovered, Quinby returned to duty on the morning of May 16 but it was deemed necessary for General Crocker to retain command of the division as they were deploying for battle at Champion Hill. Quinby agreed, concluding he was still in a feeble condition from the journey to rejoin the army. He did however remain on the field until the battle was decided only then did he officially assume command of the division. Quinby led his division during the May 22 assaults on Vicksburg. During the siege, on June 3, Quinby’s health began to fail him again and went on another sick leave, only this time he would not return to field command. He returned to New York where he commanded a Draft Depot at Elmira, New York before he resigned from the army on December 31, 1863.
Quinby returned to his position as professor at Rochester University in 1863 and taught there until 1884. Later in life he served as a U.S. Marshal and author. He died in Rochester, New York in 1891.

In the medieval period, it was known as "Cokkes Lane" and was the site of legal brothels. It is famous as the site of the house (No. 25) where the supposed Cock Lane ghost manifested itself in 1762, and as being the place where the writer John Bunyan, who wrote England's first best-seller, died from a fever in 1688. 
The junction of Giltspur Street and Cock Lane was known as Pye Corner, famous as marking the furthest extent of the Great Fire of London: commemorated by the Golden Boy of Pye Corner. This effigy was originally built into the front of a public house called The Fortune of War which used to occupy the site but was pulled down in 1910.

Flying wires

The flying wires of an aircraft work in conjunction with other wing components such as spars and interplane struts to transmit flight loads. Most commonly used on biplane aircraft they are also used on monoplanes and triplanes.
Purpose.
Strictly the flying wires (or lift wires) are those that carry lifting loads whereas the landing wires support the weight of the mainplanes on the ground and as the name suggests, the inertial forces that are often encountered on landing. Both are sets of diagonal wires within each of the bays defined by the interplane struts. Lift forces distort each bay upwards on its outer edge so the diagonal that runs outwards from bottom to top planes increases in length; thus the flying wires that resist this distortion run along this diagonal and the landing wires along the other.
Flying wires also serve to maintain dihedral and angle of incidence by lengthening or shortening individual wires using turnbuckles or threaded end fittings. The initial setting or in-service adjustment of these angles, usually with the help of a clinometer and plumb-bob, is known as 'rigging'. The wires may be lengths of simple stranded cable, aerofoil sectioned steel or piano wire. Thinner wires found between the interplane struts are known as incidence wires.

It was a conventional single-bay biplane with wings of unequal span braced by I-struts. It featured an open cockpit and a fixed, tailskid undercarriage. The upper wing was fitted with aerodynamically balanced ailerons and fuselage had an oval cross-section.
Design and development.
The D.I had a protracted development through the course of 1917, with at least six development prototypes built before Rumpler settled on a final design in 1918 in time for the "Idflieg"'s D-type competition at Adlershof. Two 8D1s participated, powered by Mercedes D.III engines. Another one participated in the follow-on competition in autumn, this time with a BMW engine. 
Operational history.
The "Idflieg" approved the type for production and issued the designation D.I, but only a small number were produced; the war was practically over and none saw operational service.

Strawberry Road

Strawberry Road (28 September 1979 – 1 June 1995) was a champion Australian Thoroughbred racehorse who went on to race in Germany, France, the United States, and Japan. Bred in New South Wales, he was by the 'superbly-bred' Whiskey Road (Nijinsky-Bowl Of Flowers) out of Giftisa (by Rich Gift - a grandson of Nasrullah and Abernant).
Racing career.
In Australia.
Trained by Doug Bougoure, Strawberry Road had two starts late in his two-year-old season before making a winning start to the new season on 11 August 1982, in the Queensland Maiden Handicap at Eagle Farm. Following a spell, he progressed from an Improvers to a Graduation with four wins in a row. Taken to Sydney, and stepped up to stakes company, he finished second to Marscay (the previous year's Golden Slipper winner) in the Hobartville Stakes, and, after two further lead-up runs, recorded his first Group One wins in the Rosehill Guineas and the AJC Derby. Back in Queensland, following a brief let-up, Strawberry Road won three of his four starts, including the Queensland Derby. After recording 10 wins for the season, including three in Group One races, Strawberry Road was named Australia's champion racehorse for the 1982-1983 season.
In the spring, Strawberry Road campaigned in Melbourne, and, interspersed with defeats at Caulfield, won the Freeway Stakes, the Centennial Stakes, and the Cox Plate. In the autumn, Strawberry Road failed to find his best form, and, after 26 starts in Australia, which produced 13 wins, three seconds, and three thirds, a controlling interest was sold to Ray Stehr and John Singleton, who exported him to France.
International Campaigns.
Trained by John Nicholls, Strawberry Road won the Grosser Preis von Baden in Germany in 1984. He then finished fifth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in France, third and fourth, respectively, in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Turf in the United States, and closed the year with a seventh in the Japan Cup, ridden by the great English jockey Lester Pigott. 
Strawberry Road returned to France in 1985, and, under new trainer Patrick Biancone, won the Prix d'Harcourt. He was then sold to prominent French horseman Daniel Wildenstein, for whom he won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Wildenstein then sent Strawberry Road to the United States, where he ran second to the champion Pebbles, by a neck, in the Breeders' Cup Turf. Sold to Allen Paulson and Bruce McNall, Strawberry Road remained in the United States, and was trained by Hall of Fame trainer Charlie Whittingham.
Now seven, Strawberry Road recorded the last feature win of his career in the Arcadia Handicap at California's Santa Anita Park in 1986.
At Stud.
Retired to stud by Paulson (now his sole owner), at his Brookside Farm in Versailles, Kentucky, Strawberry Road was a highly successful sire. His 368 progeny included 233 winners, and among the most successful were:
Strawberry Road is also the damsire of:
In 1995, Strawberry Road contracted a bacterial infection that led to peritonitis and pneumonia. In a weakened condition, he fell in his stall, fracturing the femur in his right hindleg, and had to be euthanised.

Cradley Heath Baptist Church

Cradley Heath Baptist Church, also known as Four-ways Baptist Church, was the first Church of any denomination to build a chapel in Cradley Heath, West Midlands. The first meeting was in December 1833, in Granger's Lane. Later, land was bought near the Four-Ways end of the High Street, and a meeting place was built. The site was expanded, and two further buildings were built, the last in 1904. This is now a listed building.
The church is noted for appointing Britain's first recorded black West Indian pastor, Rev. George Cosens (or Cousens), in 1837.
Origins.
Cradley Heath Baptist Church began as an off-shoot of Cradley Baptist Church in 1833. The Minister, Rev. Jabez Tunnicliff, read a verse from the Bible which challenged his theology. He paused so long in his sermon that some of the officers thought he was ill. He continued the sermon, but began Bible study which led him to part, amicably, with Cradley Baptist Church. A total of 34 others (though one returned) left with him that year. In December 1833 they began to meet and formed a new Church. Other people, from Cradley Heath, joined them at such a rate that in 1834 they had to build a substantial chapel. This first building was enlarged in 1850 by adding a gallery on the ground within the iron railings fence shown in the sketch of the first building. This is the side entrance as shown on the right hand side of the photograph.
Deacons.
Of the original 4 deacons, church officers responsible for practical administration, two deserve mention. Benjamin Fellows also served as a lay preacher, and performed baptisms. This is usually done by the Minister, but Mr Fellows officiated at two baptism services during 1838 when George Cosens was the minister. This may have been for practical reasons. Until a baptistry inside the building had been provided, baptisms were often carried out in "the cut" - a branch of a local canal.
Samuel Hallam, with his wife Ann, were not local to Cradley Heath. They were milliners, and had shops in Stourbridge, then Dudley, and finally in Birmingham before emigrating to Canada. Samuel came from Cromford, Ann from Sheffield, and they married in Tamworth. Jabez Tunnicliff's wife, Mary, was in the same trade, and probably worked in the Hallam's shop. Before joining the new Cradley Heath Baptist Church, Samuel had been a Deacon in the Baptist Church in Stourbridge. He served as secretary and treasurer in the Sunday School until 1841.
Particular and General Baptists.
An explanation is needed of the doctrinal issue which led Tunnicliff to leave Cradley Baptist Church. British Baptists form two main groups according to one specific point of Protestant doctrine. This concerns Calvinism, which teaches that the work of Christ was not for everyone, but only for a few, the elect. The theological term here is "Particular Atonement". Related to this is a concept that the "elect" are "born-again" by a work of God, which John Calvin thought to have happened to him when he was baptised as a baby by an Augustinian monk. This enables them to believe when they hear the gospel. Related to this is another concept, "Irresistible Grace", which teaches that the "elect" cannot resist the call of God, and that the "non-elect" cannot respond to it.
The General Baptists follow Arminian theology, in that the work of Christ was for all, but not everyone believes and benefits from it. Being "born again" is a work of God which follows believing in Jesus Christ. But believing is not something one can do unaided. Conversion begins with a work of God to call, and to awaken to hear the call, and to give the faith with which one believes. But in contrast to Calvinism, the call of God is not irresistible, but people still have the freedom to refuse. In many respects, however, as expressions of Protestant thinking in the 16th century, Arminianism and Calvinism have much in common and are like brothers from the same family.
The challenge to Tunnicliff's theology began with a challenge to the determinism implied by "Irresistible Grace". This led to his finding from Bible study that he considered that the General Baptist doctrines were right, and that he could no longer, with good conscience, continue to be salaried by a Particular Baptist congregation.
History.
Although the Baptists were first to build a chapel in Cradley Heath, Primitive Methodists met in homes and workshops, from about 1820, but did not build until 1841. Some headlines in the history of Cradley Heath Baptist Church relate to the Ministers and others involved there.
Rev. George Cosens, first black minister.
Cradley Heath Baptist Church is notable for having had the first Afro-Caribbean Minister in the Black Country, said to be the first known in Britain. In 1837, Rev. George Cosens was called to be minister. He was very popular, and served in various other churches in the area. His first time there was from 1837 to 1839. But he later served at Cradley Heath Baptist Church from 1869 to 1879. His second term was very successful at first, but later the health problems of old age were such that he was to be asked to resign. A meeting of the Deacons of the Church held on 2 June 1879 accepted his resignation. He moved to a less onerous pastorate at Brierley Hill.
Born in 1805 He was said to have come from Jamaica to study in a London college. In 1823, he was converted to Christianity while he and another student spent some free time in a church. He was disowned by his family, but clung to his Christian faith. He never returned to his native Jamaica, but served various churches as their pastor. His first church activity was with the Primitive Methodists from 1824. In May 1830 he married Mary Burnett, who died in June 1931 In 1832, he was sent by the Sunderland Circuit to the Norman Isles. Extracts from his journal published in the Primitive Methodist Magazine show 6 months successful work in Jersey and Gurnsey. But Kendall in his 1906 history says Cosens had to be recalled after being fined for tactless comments about young people in his audience. During mission work with John Nelson in Weymouth he left the Primitive Methodists after a disagreement, and joined the Baptists. His first appointment with the Baptists was as an assistant pastor at the New Connexion General Baptist Church at Aylesbury in 1837. His first pastorate at Cradley Heath began in November 1837.
Cosens died in 1881, and was buried in the cemetery of Brierley Hill Baptist Church (DY5 2RR) where he was then the Minister. The life of George Cosens is becoming celebrated in Britain's black community.
The variant spelling George Cousens is found in the 1933 Centenary Souvenir history by Rev. Idris Williams. The spelling Cosens is found in the minutes in the Secretary's Book from 1876 to 1889 and on the inscription on the 1876 photograph.
Buildings.
The first meeting place, after Tunnicliff's own home, was on 23 December 1833, "the wheelwright's smithy" near Five-Ways. This has been identified as in the yard of "Heath Cottage", Grainger's Lane.
In September 1834, they bought a piece of ground in the "Quarry Piece", Cradley Heath. The first building was erected in December 1834, "a fine new chapel seated for about 300". It was on the site of most of the present schoolroom. The gallery was added later. This extension is at the right-hand side of the above photograph. Neighbouring St Luke's Church was built in 1847.
The present main building was opened in December 1904. It is a substantial brick building with a spire and ornaments both inside and outside. A two-manual plus pedals pipe organ adorns one side.
The original chapel now serves as the schoolroom and hall. At various times in cold winters, the congregation have returned to the old building.
In the 1987, Sandwell Council made it a Grade II Listed Building, as being a significant landmark.
The present day.
In spite of dwindling numbers, the congregation has continued to meet. During 2007, the question of continuing in the present building was discussed. After much debate, it was decided to continue. The 175th Anniversary was celebrated in December 2008.
As well as the Sunday morning meeting, Cradley Heath Baptist Church is involved in providing for the needs of people in local nursing homes who cannot get to a place of worship. There is also a short open-air meeting for hymn singing on some Saturdays, sometimes in the market, or on other open spaces just before Christmas.
Community activities include a "Toddlers Group" on Friday mornings, and a gardening club on the first Thursday evening of the month. The Cradley Heath Flower & Gardening Club was originally planned for the summer of 2009, but is so popular that it continues to meet during the winter. On 5 November 2009, the Special Demonstrator at the Club's Open Evening was Andrew Lloyd, Florist from Stourbridge. He is the NAFAS Area Chairman for Three Counties & South Wales and has been in the Floristry Business for 27 years. He presented 'A Floral Sparkler' and it was a sell-out event, with an audience of nearly 90 people.
The Christmas activities in December 2009 included a "Christmas Spectacular" concert featuring children from nearby Springfield Primary School and a special guest appearance from international rising star Charlie Green, a semi-finalist on "Britain's Got Talent" in 2008. 250 tickets were sold to raise funds for urgent repairs to this listed building.
The Church is involved in an annual Christmas toy collection. In 2010, this was donated to local charity Loaves 'N' Fishes to provide toys to needy children. The collection was boosted by the generosity of the people of Cradley Heath through the local Tesco's supermarket which kindly provided a collection point.
During the winter of 2009-2010, the church building suffered from thieves taking lead from the roof. This was at about the same time as lead was taken, twice, from the roof of the nearby public library building, and from a number of private houses. The church building suffered from significant amounts of water leaking in. The pipe organ alone required repairs estimated at about £4,000
During the first quarter of 2011, a disabled standard toilet was built in the Choir Vestry, as part of upgrading the building to 21st century standards. Being a listed building, the construction had to be such that the original building features were not damaged. A grant application to English Heritage was made during 2010. The building was judged to be of sufficient historical interest that a grant of £106,000 was awarded in March 2011, leaving an estimated £60,000 to be found to cover major building repairs including dry rot damage and the first replacement roof on the original 19th century building.
The first phase of general renovation took place during the first 6 months of 2013. This repaired the front (west end) and north side of the 1904 building, including replacement of ornamental terra-cotta features, and the floor on the north side.

John Raven

John Earle Raven (; 13 December 1914 – 5 March 1980), who published as J. E. Raven, was an English classical scholar, notable for his work on presocratic philosophy, and amateur botanist.
Early life and education.
John Raven was born on 13 December 1914 in Cambridge, the son of Charles Earle Raven, sometime Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge and Master of Christ's College, Cambridge and of Margaret Wollaston. His mother's family endowed Raven with a distinguished intellectual pedigree, including between 1723 and 1829 seven Fellows of the Royal Society (among them Charlton Wollaston, Francis Wollaston (1694-1774), Francis Wollaston (1762-1823), George Wollaston and William Hyde Wollaston); Raven was also a 7th generation direct descendent of William Wollaston, the philosophical writer. On his father's side, he was related to Dean Hole.
Raven was educated at St Ronan's School, then situated at Worthing, before proceeding in September 1928 with a scholarship to Marlborough College, where he distinguished himself academically, winning prizes in English verse, Greek iambics, Greek and Latin prose and Latin verse, culminating in a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. He did not confine himself to the intellectual, playing in the first XV at rugby and setting new school records in 1934 for the high jump and 440 yards.
Following the award of a first class degree in classics at Trinity Raven became in 1946 a research fellow there. In October 1948 he was elected a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, a position he held until his retirement in 1984.
During the Second World War he was a conscientious objector, basing his case on arguments by Plato. He undertook unsalaried social work for Guy Clutton-Brock at Oxford House in Bethnal Green.
Classical scholar.
As a classical scholar, Raven's interests were in ancient philosophy. In 1957 he published with Geoffrey Kirk "The Pre-Socratic philosophers", a standard work for undergraduates still in use today. Raven contributed the chapters relating to the Italian tradition (Pythagoras of Samos, Alcmaeon of Croton, Pre-Parmenidean Pythagoreanism, Parmenides of Elea, Zeno of Elea, Melissus of Samos, Philolaus of Croton and Eurytus of Croton) and on Anaxagoras and Archelaus.
As Senior Tutor at King's in the 1960s he turned the college to the left telling public schools that their boys could no longer expect to swan in as before.
Raven was the undergraduate tutor of Myles Burnyeat who would subsequently become the fifth Laurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at Cambridge University.
Botanist: The Heslop-Harrison fraud.
While Raven's principal professional occupation was his career as a classical scholar, he applied a similar intellectual rigour to his amateur interest in botany.
From the mid-1930s John Heslop-Harrison, Professor of Botany at King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne, had reported significant new plant discoveries on expeditions to the Inner and Outer Hebrides. The sheer scale of the discoveries aroused scepticism and in 1948 Raven secured a grant from Trinity College to fund a trip to Harris and Rùm in July and August of that year to investigate the claims of Heslop-Harrison.
Raven's conclusions about two of the notable species were published, briefly, in "Nature". He suggested that both "Carex bicolor" and "Polycarpon tetraphyllum" were introductions to Rùm, but did not comment on the possible means of introduction. His full report of the expedition and fraud was deposited in the library of King's College, Cambridge on 5 May 1960, to attack Prof. Jack Heslop-Harrison's electron microscope research into plant genetics (DNA) and only published in full in 1999 after the deaths of both Heslop-Harrison, his son Jack Heslop-Harrison and Raven himself. In the report Raven alleged that at some time in the 1940s Heslop Harrison transported alien plants to the Isle of Rum and planted them in the soil; he then "discovered" the plants, claimed they were indigenous to the area and that he was the first to find them. Raven's report to the council of Trinity College states: "In the interests not only of truth but also of the reputation of British science it is essential somehow to discover what plants and what insects he (Heslop Harrison) has either completely fabricated or else deliberately introduced into the Hebrides."
Raven's classical and botanical interests were brought together in four J. H. Gray Lectures given at Cambridge in 1976, published after his death as "Plants and Plant Lore in Ancient Greece".
Family.
Raven married Constance Faith Alethea Hugh Smith; they had five children: Anna Raven, Andrew Raven, Hugh Raven, Sarah Raven and Jane Raven. On marriage in 1954 John and Faith Raven purchased Docwra's Manor in Shepreth, near Cambridge, where they cultivated a garden which is now open to the public.
He died on 5 March 1980 in Shepreth, near Cambridge, aged 65. Following his death a group of friends contributed to a collection of essays to commemorate his life, published in 1981 as "John Raven by his Friends".

USS Dlonra (SP-66)

USS "Dlonra" (SP-66) was an armed motorboat that served in the United States Navy as a patrol vessel from 1917 until after the end of World War I.
Little is known about "Dlonra". She was a private motorboat of the same name when the U.S. Navy acquired her for World War I service as a patrol vessel in 1917 and commissioned her as USS "Dlonra" (SP-66).
"Dlonra" was attached to the 1st Naval District and performed patrol duty in the area of Portland, Maine. In 1918 she was shipped to France where for the remainder of the war she served as a transport tender.
Records of "Dlonra"s status after the end of World War I on 11 November 1918 are lacking. Presumably she was decommissioned and disposed of—perhaps sold or returned to her owner—in late 1918 or 1919, as was the case with most of the many private craft that went into U.S. Navy service as patrol boats during World War I.

Armadio della vergogna

The armoire of shame () is a wooden cabinet discovered in 1994 inside a large storage room in Palazzo Cesi-Gaddi, Rome which, at the time, housed the chancellery of the military attorney's office. The cabinet contained an archive of 695 files documenting war crimes perpetrated on Italian soil under fascist rule and during Nazi occupation after the September 8, 1943 armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces. The actions described in the records spanned several years and took place in various areas of the country, from the southern city of Acerra to the northern province of Trieste and as far east as the Balkans; it remains unclear, to this day, how the archive remained concealed for so long, and who gave the order to hide the files in the immediate post-war period.
Discovery.
In 1994, military prosecutor Antonino Intelisano, who was at the time in charge of the trial against former SS officer Erich Priebke, accidentally uncovered the content of the wooden cabinet, which had remained stored for decades, face to the wall, in an unused room in Palazzo Cesi. Its contents had seemingly been placed in the armoire temporarily, probably in the immediate post-war months, and forgotten or (perhaps purposely) overlooked.
The armoire contained the memorandum titled "Atrocities in Italy", stamped "secret", which had been compiled by the British Secret Intelligence Service, whose officers had documented the victims' accusations and painstakingly collected depositions, and consigned it to the Italian magistrates, who failed to prosecute the individuals mentioned in the files, limiting publication of details and accusations to the cases against unnamed Nazi and fascist officers.
Among the previously unknown war crimes which were then brought to justice are noteworthy:

Werkspoor Jumbo

__NOTOC__
The Werkspoor Jumbo was a 1930s Dutch biplane freighter aircraft design by Joop Carley and built by Werkspoor. Only one aircraft was built (registered PH-AFI) which was sometimes called the Carley Jumbo and was operated by KLM for two years.
Ordered in 1927 as a specialised freighter for KLM. The Jumbo was a large single-engined biplane fitted with two large cargo doors.
Delivered in 1931 it was operated by KLM between Amsterdam, Rotterdam and London for two years and was then passed to the airlines training centre which operated it for the next eight years. In 1938 it was described as a good trainer. The aircraft was destroyed at Amsterdam-Schiphol in a German bombing raid on the 10 May 1940.

Heroes (play)

Heroes is a 2005 translation into English and adaptation by Tom Stoppard of the 2003 French play "Le Vent Des Peupliers" by Gérald Sibleyras.
The play is a comedy set in 1959 in a French retirement home for First World War veterans. (The literal translation of "Le vent des peupliers" is "The Wind in the Poplars". During the adaptation into English, there was concern this might cause confusion due to being too close to the popular children's title "The Wind in the Willows", so "Heroes" was agreed as the English title. At the time, Stoppard said, "To tell you the truth, if Charles Wood hadn't written a play called Veterans 1972, we would have called it that.")
The original production opened at London's Wyndham's Theatre on 18 October 2005 and closed on 14 January 2006. It starred Richard Griffiths, John Hurt and Ken Stott.

Battle of Castiglione (1706)

The Battle of Castiglione took place on 8 September 1706 in the War of the Spanish Succession. A French army defeated a Hessian army besieging Castiglione delle Stiviere.
The battle.
Since May 1706 a French army of 48,000 under Louis d'Aubusson de la Feuillade was besieging the Savoy capital Turin, while another army of 44,000 under Louis Joseph de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme barred the Austrians' path from Lake Garda. However Vendôme was recalled to Flanders to restore order after the lost Battle of Ramillies, leaving command to the inexperienced Duke of Orléans. Eugene of Savoy exploited the situation and dashed to Turin, forcing Orléans to split his forces. He left 23,000 men under the Count of Médavy near the Adige in case allied reinforcements appeared from the other side of the Alps.
In fact, a Hessian army under the Crown-Prince of Hessen-Kassel, the future King Frederick I of Sweden, crossed the Alps and besieged Castiglione. Here Médavy attacked and totally defeated the Hessians, inflicting a loss of 8,000 killed, wounded, and missing.
Aftermath.
This defeat was a setback for the Hessians, who had won the Battle of Turin the previous day and forced the French out of Milan and Savoy. Now, however, Médavy remained in control of Cremona and Mantua, blocking communications through the Alpine passes, and other French troops still occupied key towns in central Italy; a link-up with the 8,000 Spanish troops in Naples was not impossible.
The allies were divided over how to proceed. The maritime powers insisted on pursuing the fleeing French over the Alps and taking control of the French naval base of Toulon to force Louis XIV to make peace. Emperor Joseph I of Austria was determined to deal with Médavy first, to clear the way for the completion of his Italian plans, which were the permanent conquest of the Spanish possessions of Naples and Sicily.
Louis XIV came to his aid. The French King was desperately short of troops and opened bilateral negotiations with Joseph for safe passage back to France for his remaining troops in Italy. Despite Anglo-Dutch protests, Joseph concluded the convention of Milan with France on 13 March 1707, which permitted the army of Médavy to march unmolested back to France, opening the way to Southern Italy for the Austrian army of Count Wirich Philipp von Daun. He reached the Neapolitan frontier on 22 June, and two weeks later the Spanish troops there, cut of from reinforcements by sea or land, capitulated.
The attack on Toulon materialized on 29 July but by now the French were prepared and strengthened, and the attack was a failure.

History of the aircraft carrier

Aircraft carriers are warships that evolved from balloon-carrying wooden vessels into nuclear-powered vessels carrying scores of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. Since their introduction they have allowed naval forces to project air power great distances without having to depend on local bases for staging aircraft operations. 
Balloon carriers were the first ships to deploy manned aircraft, used during the 19th and early 20th century, mainly for observation purposes. The advent of fixed-wing aircraft in 1903 was followed in 1910 by the first flight from the deck of a US Navy cruiser. Seaplanes and seaplane tender support ships, such as , followed. The development of flat top vessels produced the first large fleet ships. This evolution was well underway by the early to mid-1920s, resulting in the commissioning of ships such as "Hōshō" (1922), (1924), Béarn (1927), and the s (1927).
Most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had even served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships. During the 1920s, several navies started ordering and building aircraft carriers that were specifically designed as such. This allowed the design to be specialized to their future role, and resulted in superior ships. During the Second World War, these ships would become the backbone of the carrier forces of the US, British, and Japanese navies, known as fleet carriers. 
World War II saw the first large-scale use of aircraft carriers and induced further refinement of their launch and recovery cycle leading to several design variants. The USA built small escort carriers, such as , as a stop-gap measure to provide air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. Subsequent light aircraft carriers, such as , represented a larger, more "militarized" version of the escort carrier concept. Although the light carriers usually carried the same size air groups as escort carriers, they had the advantage of higher speed as they had been converted from cruisers under construction.
Early history - balloon and seaplane carriers.
The earliest recorded instance of using a ship for airborne operations occurred in 1806, when Lord Cochrane of the Royal Navy launched kites from the 32-gun frigate in order to drop propaganda leaflets. The proclamations against Napoleon Bonaparte, written in French, were attached to kites, and the kite strings were set alight; when the strings had burned through, the leaflets landed on French soil.
Balloon carriers.
Just over 40 years later on 12 July 1849, the Austrian Navy ship "Vulcano" was used for launching early aircraft. A number of small Montgolfiere hot air ballons were launched with the intention of dropping bombs on Venice. Although the attempt largely failed due to contrary winds which drove the balloons back over the ship, one bomb did land on the city.
Later, during the American Civil War, about the time of the Peninsula Campaign, gas-filled balloons were used to perform reconnaissance on Confederate positions. The battles soon turned inland into the heavily forested areas of the Peninsula, however, where balloons could not travel. A coal barge, the , was cleared of all deck rigging to accommodate the gas generators and apparatus of balloons. From the barge Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, Chief Aeronaut of the Union Army Balloon Corps, made his first ascents over the Potomac River and telegraphed claims of the success of the first aerial venture ever made from a water-borne vessel. Other barges were converted to assist with the other military balloons transported about the eastern waterways, but none of these Civil War craft ever took to the high seas.
Balloons launched from ships led to the development of balloon carriers, or balloon tenders, during World War I, by the navies of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Sweden. About ten such "balloon tenders" were built, their main objective being aerial observation posts. These ships were either decommissioned or converted to seaplane tenders after the war.
Seaplane carriers.
The invention of the seaplane in March 1910—with the French Fabre Hydravion—led to development of the earliest ship designed as an "aircraft carrier", albeit limited to aircraft equipped with floats: in December 1911 appears the French Navy "Foudre", the first seaplane carrier. Commissioned as a seaplane tender, and carrying seaplanes under hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered onto the sea with a crane, she participated in tactical exercises in the Mediterranean in 1912. "Foudre" was further modified in November 1913 with a 10 meter flat deck to launch her seaplanes.
, temporarily converted as an experimental seaplane carrier in April–May 1913, was also one of the first seaplane carriers, and the first experimental seaplane carrier of the Royal Navy. She was originally laid down as a merchant ship, but was converted on the building stocks to be a seaplane carrier for a few trials in 1913, before being converted again to a cruiser, and back again to a seaplane carrier in 1914. She was sunk by a German submarine in October 1914. The first seaplane tender of the US Navy was the , converted to that role in December 1913.
In September 1914, during World War I, in the Battle of Tsingtao, the Imperial Japanese Navy seaplane carrier "Wakamiya" conducted the world's first successful naval-launched air raids. It lowered four Maurice Farman seaplanes into the water using its crane. These seaplanes later took off to bombard German forces, and were retrieved back from the surface afterwards.
On the Western front the first naval air raid occurred on 25 December 1914 when twelve seaplanes from , and (cross-channel steamers converted into seaplane carriers) attacked the Zeppelin base at Cuxhaven. The attack was not a complete success, although a German warship was damaged; nevertheless the raid demonstrated in the European theatre the feasibility of attack by ship-borne aircraft and showed the strategic importance of this new weapon.
Many cruisers and capital ships of the inter-war years often carried a catapult-launched seaplane for reconnaissance and spotting the fall of shot. Such seaplanes were launched by a catapult and recovered by crane from the water after landing. They were successful even during World War II. There were many notable successes early in the war, such as 's float-equipped Swordfish during the Second Battle of Narvik in 1940, which spotted for the guns of the British warships, helping to sink seven German destroyers, and sank the German submarine "U-64" with bombs. The Japanese Nakajima A6M2-N "Rufe" floatplane, derived from the Zero, was also a formidable fighter with only a slight loss in flight performance; one of its pilots scored 26 kills.
Genesis of the flat-deck carrier.
Of carrier operations mounted during the war, one of the most successful took place on 19 July 1918 when seven Sopwith Camels launched from HMS "Furious" attacked the German Zeppelin base at Tondern, with two bombs each. Several airships and balloons were destroyed, but as the carrier had no method of recovering the aircraft, two of the pilots ditched their aircraft in the sea alongside the carrier while the others headed for neutral Denmark.
Inter-war years.
The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 placed strict limits on the tonnages of battleships and battlecruisers for the major naval powers after World War I, as well as not only a limit on the total tonnage for carriers, but also an upper limit of 27000 tons for each ship. Although exceptions were made regarding the maximum ship tonnage (fleet units counted, experimental units did not), the total tonnage could not be exceeded. However, while all of the major navies were over-tonnage on battleships, they were all considerably under-tonnage on aircraft carriers. Consequently, many battleships and battlecruisers under construction (or in service) were converted into aircraft carriers.
HMS "Argus": the first full-length flat deck.
The first ship to have a full-length flat deck was , the conversion of which was completed in September 1918. The United States Navy did not follow suit until 1920, when the conversion of (an experimental ship which did not count against America's carrier tonnage) was completed. The first American fleet carriers would not enter service until November, 1927 when the "Lexington"-class was commissioned. (The class lead ship itself, , was commissioned in December of that year.)
"Hōshō": the first purpose-built aircraft carrier commissioned.
The first purpose-designed aircraft carrier to be laid down was (1924) in 1918. Japan began work on the following year. In December 1922, "Hōshō" became the first to be commissioned, while "Hermes" was commissioned in February 1924.
<!-- clear for the longer title to follow -->
HMS "Hermes" (1924): the full-length flight deck / starboard control tower island -design emerges.
The design of HMS "Hermes" (1924) preceded and influenced that of "Hōshō", and its construction actually began earlier, but numerous tests, experiments and budget considerations delayed its commission. The long gestation of "Hermes" resulted finally in the first aircraft carrier to display the two most distinctive features of a modern aircraft carrier: the full-length flight deck, and the starboard side control tower island. With the exception of the squared-off flight deck prow and angled flight deck of later carriers, "Hermes" was the first to display the main features of the classic silhouette and plan layout of the great majority of aircraft carriers produced over at least the next 90 years.
HMS "Hermes" (1924) was commissioned 2 days earlier than a sister aircraft carrier, . Like "Hermes", "Eagle" had a full-length flight deck and a starboard-side control tower island. Unlike "Hermes", however, "Eagle" was a converted battleship and had a less integrated design and appearance than the purpose-designed "Hermes".
A "hurricane bow" is a bow sealed up to the flight deck, first seen on (1924). The American "Lexington" class also featured this when they entered service in 1927. Combat experience proved it to be by far the most useful configuration for the bow of the ship among others that were tried, including an additional flying-off deck and an anti-aircraft battery. The latter was the most common American configuration during World War II, seen in the "Essex" class (the "long-hull" variant), and it was not until after the war when majority of American carriers incorporated the hurricane bow. The first Japanese carrier with a hurricane bow was .
Important innovations just before and during World War II.
By the late 1930s, carriers around the world typically carried three types of aircraft: torpedo bombers, also used for conventional bombings and reconnaissance; dive bombers, also used for reconnaissance (in the U.S. Navy, aircraft of this type were known as "scout bombers"); and fighters for fleet defence and bomber escort duties. Because of the restricted space on aircraft carriers, all these aircraft were of small, single-engined types, usually with folding wings to facilitate storage. In the late 1930s, the RN also developed the concept of the armoured flight deck, enclosing the hangar in an armoured box. The lead ship of this new type, HMS "Illustrious", commissioned in 1940.
Light aircraft carriers.
Prior to the beginning of the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt noticed that no new aircraft carriers were expected to enter the fleet before 1944, and proposed the conversion of several "Cleveland"-class cruiser hulls that had already been laid down. They were intended to serve as additional fast carriers, as escort carriers did not have the requisite speed to keep up with the fleet carriers and their escorts. The actual U.S. Navy classification was small aircraft carrier (CVL), not light. Prior to July 1943, they were just classified as aircraft carriers (CV).
The Royal Navy made a similar design which served both them and Commonwealth countries after World War II. One of these carriers, (1959), was still in use as India's INS "Viraat".
Escort carriers and merchant aircraft carriers.
To protect Atlantic convoys, the British developed what they called Merchant Aircraft Carriers, which were merchant ships equipped with a flat deck for six aircraft. These operated with civilian crews, under merchant colors, and carried their normal cargo besides providing air support for the convoy. As there was no lift or hangar, aircraft maintenance was limited and the aircraft spent the entire trip sitting on the deck.
These served as a stop-gap measure until dedicated escort carriers (CVE) could be built in the U.S. About a third of the size of a fleet carrier, they carried between 20 and 30 aircraft, mostly for anti-submarine duties. Over 100 were built or converted from merchantmen. Escort carriers were built in the US from two basic hull designs: one from a merchant ship, and the other from a slightly larger, slightly faster tanker. Besides defending convoys, these were used to transport aircraft across the ocean. Nevertheless, some participated in the battles to liberate the Philippines, notably the Battle off Samar in which six escort carriers and their escorting destroyers aggressively attacked five Japanese battleships and bluffed them into retreating.
Catapult aircraft merchantmen.
As an emergency stop-gap before sufficient merchant aircraft carriers became available, the British provided air cover for convoys using Catapult aircraft merchantman (CAM ships). CAM ships were merchant vessels equipped with an aircraft, usually a battle-weary Hawker Hurricane, launched by a catapult. Once launched, the aircraft could not land back on the deck and had to ditch in the sea if it was not within range of land. In over two years, fewer than 10 launches were ever made, yet these flights did have some success: 6 bombers for the loss of a single pilot.
World War II.
Aircraft carriers played a significant role in World War II. With seven aircraft carriers afloat, the Royal Navy had a considerable numerical advantage at the start of the war as neither the Germans nor the Italians had carriers of their own. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of by German battlecruisers during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. The first British warship lost in the war was by "U-29" on 17 September 1939.
The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at Taranto signalling the beginning of the effective mobile aircraft strikes, by short ranged aircraft. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing Malta, both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the Italian Navy and land-based German aircraft from dominating the Mediterranean theatre.
In the Atlantic, aircraft from and were responsible for slowing the German battleship during May 1941. Later in the war, escort carriers proved their worth guarding convoys crossing the Atlantic and Arctic oceans.
Germany and Italy also started with the construction or conversion of several aircraft carriers, but with the exception of the nearly finished , no ship was launched.
World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. Japan started the war with ten aircraft carriers, the largest and most modern carrier fleet in the world at that time. There were seven American aircraft carriers at the beginning of the hostilities, although only three of them were operating in the Pacific.
Drawing on the 1939 Japanese development of shallow-water modifications for aerial torpedoes and the 1940 British aerial attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto, the 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single striking unit marked a turning point in naval history, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. 
Meanwhile, the Japanese began their advance through Southeast Asia, and the sinking of "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" by Japanese land-based aircraft proved in finality that aircraft, and aircraft carrying warships, would dominate the seas. For the first time in naval history aircraft had sunk a battleship while maneuvering at sea and fighting back. In April 1942, the Japanese fast carrier strike force ranged into the Indian Ocean and sank shipping, including the damaged and undefended carrier (1924). Smaller Allied fleets with inadequate aerial protection were forced to retreat or be destroyed. The Doolittle Raid, consisting of 16 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers launched from the USS "Hornet" (CV-8) against Tokyo, forced the recall of the Japanese strike force to home waters. In the Battle of the Coral Sea, the world's first carrier battle and one in which fleets only exchanged blows with aircraft became a tactical victory for the Japanese, but a strategic victory for the allies. For the first time in history, at the Battle of Midway, a naval battle was decisively fought by aircraft and not warships; all four Japanese carriers engaged were sunk by planes from three American carriers (one of which was lost); the battle is considered the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Notably, the battle was orchestrated by the Japanese to draw out American carriers that had proven very elusive and troublesome to the Japanese.
Subsequently the US was able to build up large numbers of aircraft aboard a mixture of fleet, light and (newly commissioned) escort carriers, primarily with the introduction of the "Essex" class in 1943. These ships, around which were built the fast carrier task forces of the 3rd and 5th Fleets, played a major part in winning the Pacific war. The Battle of the Philippine Sea in 1944 was the largest aircraft carrier battle in history and the decisive naval battle of World War II. 
The reign of the battleship as the primary component of a fleet finally came to an end when U.S. carrier-borne aircraft sank the largest battleships ever built, the Japanese super battleships in 1944 and in 1945. Japan built the largest aircraft carrier of the war: , which was a "Yamato"-class ship converted before being halfway completed in order to counter the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers at Midway. She was sunk by the patrolling US submarine while in transit shortly after commissioning, but before being fully outfitted or operational, in November 1944.
Wartime emergencies also spurred the creation or conversion of unconventional aircraft carriers. CAM ships, like , were cargo-carrying merchant ships that could launch but not retrieve a single fighter aircraft from a catapult. These vessels were an emergency measure during World War II as were the Merchant aircraft carriers (MACs), such as which put a flight deck on top of a cargo ship. Submarine aircraft carriers, such as the French "Surcouf" and the Japanese , which was capable of carrying three Aichi M6A "Seiran" aircraft, were first built in the 1920s but were generally unsuccessful at war.
Post-war developments.
Three major post-war developments came from the need to improve operations of jet-powered aircraft, which had higher weights and landing speeds than their propeller-powered forebears.
The first jet landing on a carrier was made by Lt Cdr Eric "Winkle" Brown who landed on in the specially modified de Havilland Vampire LZ551/G [http://www.airliners.net/photo/UK---Navy/De-Havilland-Sea/1312997/L/&width=1200&height=812&sok=WHERE__(reg_%3D_%27LZ551%27)_&sort=_order_by_photo_id_DESC_&photo_nr=1&prev_id=&next_id=1188987] on 3 December 1945. Brown is also the all-time record holder for the number of carrier landings, at 2,407.
After these successful tests, there were still many misgivings about the suitability of operating jet aircraft routinely from carriers, and LZ551/G was taken to Farnborough to participate in trials of the experimental "rubber deck". Despite significant effort toward developing this idea, and some performance advantages due to the removal of the undercarriage, it was found to be unnecessary; and following the introduction of angled flight decks, jets were operating from carriers by the mid-1950s.
Angled decks.
During World War II, aircraft would land on the flight deck parallel to the long axis of the ship's hull. Aircraft which had already landed would be parked on the deck at the bow end of the flight deck. A crash barrier was raised behind them to stop any landing aircraft which overshot the landing area because its landing hook missed the arrestor cables. If this happened, it would often cause serious damage or injury and even, if the crash barrier was not strong enough, destruction of parked aircraft.
An important development of the early 1950s was the British invention of the angled flight deck by Capt D.R.F. Campbell RN in conjunction with Lewis Boddington of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. The runway was canted at an angle of a few degrees from the longitudinal axis of the ship. If an aircraft missed the arrestor cables (referred to as a "bolter"), the pilot only needed to increase engine power to maximum to get airborne again, and would not hit the parked aircraft because the angled deck pointed out over the sea.
The angled flight deck was first tested on , by painting angled deck markings onto the centerline flight deck for touch and go landings. This was also tested on the same year. In both tests, the arresting gear and barriers remained oriented to the original axis deck. During September through December 1952 the USS "Antietam" had a rudimentary sponson installed for true angled deck tests, allowing for full arrested landings, which proved during trials to be superior. In 1953 the USS "Antietam" trained with both US and British naval units, proving the worth of the angled deck concept. HMS "Centaur" was modified with overhanging angled flight deck in 1954. The U.S. Navy installed the decks as part of the SCB-125 upgrade for the "Essex" class and SCB-110/110A for the "Midway" class. In February 1955, HMS "Ark Royal" became the first carrier to be constructed and launched with the deck, followed in the same year by the lead ships of the British "Majestic"-class (HMAS "Melbourne") and the American "Forrestal"-class (USS "Forrestal").
Steam catapults.
The modern steam-powered catapult, powered by steam from the ship's boilers or reactors, was invented by Commander C.C. Mitchell of the Royal Naval Reserve. It was widely adopted following trials on between 1950 and 1952 which showed it to be more powerful and reliable than the hydraulic catapults which had been introduced in the 1940s.
Optical Landing Systems.
The first of the Optical Landing Systems was another British innovation, the Mirror Landing Aid invented by Lieutenant Commander H. C. N. Goodhart RN. This was a gyroscopically-controlled concave mirror (in later designs replaced by a Fresnel lens Optical Landing System) on the port side of the deck. On either side of the mirror was a line of green "datum" lights. A bright orange "source" light was directed into the mirror creating the "ball" (or "meatball" in later USN parlance), which could be seen by the aviator who was about to land. The position of the ball compared to the datum lights indicated the aircraft's position in relation to the desired glidepath: if the ball was above the datum, the plane was high; below the datum, the plane was low; between the datum, the plane was on glidepath. The gyro stabilisation compensated for much of the movement of the flight deck due to the sea, giving a constant glidepath. The first trials of a mirror landing sight were conducted on HMS "Illustrious" in 1952. Prior to OLSs, pilots relied on visual flag signals from Landing Signal Officers to help maintain proper glidepath.
Nuclear age.
The U.S. Navy attempted to become a strategic nuclear force in parallel with the United States Air Force (USAF) long range bombers with the project to build the , which was termed CVA, with the "A" signifying "atomic". This ship would have carried long range twin-engine bombers, each of which could carry an atomic bomb. The project was canceled under pressure from the newly created USAF, and the letter "A" was recycled to mean "attack." This only delayed the growth of carriers. Nuclear weapons would be part of the carrier weapons load, despite Air Force objections, beginning in 1955 aboard . By the end of the 1950s the Navy had a series of nuclear-armed attack aircraft (see also USS "Franklin D. Roosevelt").
The U.S. Navy also built the first aircraft carrier to be powered by nuclear reactors. is powered by eight nuclear reactors and was the second surface warship (after ) to be powered in this way. Subsequent supercarriers starting with took advantage of this technology to increase their endurance utilizing only two reactors. Other nations operate nuclear-powered submarines, but thus far only France has a nuclear-powered carrier, the "Charles de Gaulle".
Helicopters.
The post-war years also saw the development of the helicopter, with a variety of useful roles and mission capability aboard aircraft carriers. Whereas fixed-wing aircraft are suited to air-to-air combat and air-to-surface attack, helicopters are used to transport equipment and personnel and can be used in an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) role, with dipping sonar, air-launched torpedoes, and depth charges; as well as for anti-surface vessel warfare, with air-launched anti-ship missiles.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the United Kingdom and the United States converted some older carriers into Commando Carriers or Landing Platform Helicopters (LPH); seagoing helicopter airfields like . To mitigate the expensive connotations of the term "aircraft carrier", the new "Invincible"-class carriers were originally designated as "through deck cruisers" and were initially to operate as helicopter-only craft escort carriers. The arrival of the Sea Harrier VTOL/STOVL fast jet meant they could carry fixed-wing aircraft, despite their short flight deck.
The United States used some carriers initially as pure ASW carriers, embarking helicopters and fixed-wing ASW aircraft like the S-2 Tracker. Later, specialized LPH helicopter carriers for the transport of Marine Corps troops and their helicopter transports were developed. These evolved into the Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) and later into the Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) classes of amphibious assault ships, which normally also embark a few Harrier aircraft.
Ski-jump ramp.
Another British innovation was the ski-jump ramp as an alternative to contemporary catapult systems. The ski-jump ramp at the end of a runway or flight deck allows an aircraft which makes a running start to convert part of its forward momentum into upward motion. The intent is that the additional altitude and upward-angled flight path from the jump provides extra time until the forward airspeed generated by engine thrust is high enough to maintain level flight. V/STOL aircraft often also use their ability to direct some of their thrust downwards to give them additional lift until required airspeed is attained.
As the Royal Navy retired or sold the last of its World War II-era carriers, they were replaced with smaller ships designed to operate helicopters and the V/STOVL Sea Harrier jet. The ski-jump gave the Harriers an enhanced STOVL capability, allowing them to take off with heavier payloads. It was subsequently adopted by the navies of other nations including India, Spain, Italy, Russia, and Thailand.
Post-World War II conflicts.
UN carrier operations in the Korean War.
The United Nations command began carrier operations against the North Korean Army on July 3, 1950 in response to the invasion of South Korea. Task Force 77 consisted at that time of the carriers and . Before the armistice of July 27, 1953, twelve U.S. carriers served 27 tours in the Sea of Japan as part of Task Force 77. During periods of intensive air operations as many as four carriers were on the line at the same time (see Attack on the Sui-ho Dam), but the norm was two on the line with a third "ready" carrier at Yokosuka able to respond to the Sea of Japan at short notice.
A second carrier unit, Task Force 95, served as a blockade force in the Yellow Sea off the west coast of North Korea. The task force consisted of a Commonwealth light carrier (, , , , and ) and usually a U.S. escort carrier (, , , , and ).
Over 301,000 carrier sorties were flown during the Korean War: 255,545 by the aircraft of Task Force 77; 25,400 by the Commonwealth aircraft of Task Force 95, and 20,375 by the escort carriers of Task Force 95. United States Navy and Marine Corps carrier-based combat losses were 541 aircraft. The Fleet Air Arm lost 86 aircraft in combat, and the Australian Fleet Air Arm 15.
Post-colonial conflicts.
In the period following World War II through the 1960s, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands employed their carriers during decolonization conflicts of former colonies.
France employed the carriers "Dixmude", "La Fayette", "Bois Belleau", and "Arromanches" to conduct operations against the Viet Minh during the 1946–1954 First Indochina War.
The United Kingdom used carrier-based aircraft from HMS "Eagle", "Albion", and "Bulwark", and France from "Arromanches" and "La Fayette", to attack Egyptian positions during the 1956 Suez Crisis. Royal Navy carriers "HMS Ocean" and "Theseus" acted as floating bases to ferry troops ashore by helicopter in the first ever large-scale helicopter-borne assault.
The Royal Netherlands Navy deployed HNLMS "Karel Doorman" and an escorting battle group to Western New Guinea in 1962 to protect it from Indonesian invasion. This intervention nearly resulted in her being attacked by the Indonesian Air Force using Soviet supplied Tupolev Tu-16KS-1 Badger naval bombers carrying anti-ship missiles. The attack was called off by a last-minute cease fire.
Between 1964 and 1967, the Royal Navy deployed the Far East Fleet carriers HMS "Ark Royal", "Centaur", and "Victorious" in support of operations in Borneo during the "Konfrontasi" conflict between Indonesia and Malaysia. HMS "Albion" and "Bulwark" were deployed as commando carriers, and the Australian carrier HMAS "Sydney" served as a troop transport.
Indo-Pakistan War of 1971.
During the war, India deployed INS "Vikrant" against Pakistan from its station in the Andaman Islands for operation against Pakistani forces in the East (present Bangladesh). Hawker Sea Hawks from the carrier successfully choked the Chittagong harbour and put it out of service.
U.S. carrier operations in Southeast Asia.
The United States Navy fought "the most protracted, bitter, and costly war" (René Francillon) in the history of naval aviation from August 2, 1964 to August 15, 1973 in the waters of the South China Sea. Operating from two deployment points (Yankee Station and Dixie Station), carrier aircraft supported combat operations in South Vietnam and conducted bombing operations in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force in North Vietnam under Operations Flaming Dart, Rolling Thunder, and Linebacker. The number of carriers on the line varied during differing points of the conflict, but as many as six operated at one time during Operation Linebacker.
Twenty-one aircraft carriers (all of the attack carriers operational during the era except ) deployed to Task Force 77 of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, conducting 86 war cruises and operating 9,178 total days on the line in the Gulf of Tonkin. 530 aircraft were lost in combat and 329 more in operational accidents, causing the deaths of 377 naval aviators, with 64 others reported missing and 179 captured. 205 officers and men of the ship's complements of three carriers (, , and ) were killed in major shipboard fires. At times some of the carrier groups operated over 12,000 miles from their home ports.
Falklands War.
During the Falklands War the United Kingdom was able to win a conflict 8,000 miles (13,000 km) from home in large part due to the use of the light fleet carrier (1959) and the smaller "through deck cruiser" carrier . The Falklands showed the value of a STOVL aircraft—the Hawker Siddeley Harrier (the RN Sea Harrier and press-ganged RAF Harriers)—in defending the fleet and assault force from shore-based aircraft and in attacking the enemy. Sea Harriers shot down 21 fast-attack jets and suffered no aerial combat losses, although six were lost to accidents and ground fire. Helicopters from the carriers were used to deploy troops and for medevac, search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare.
Another lesson from the Falklands War resulted in the withdrawal of Argentina's aircraft carrier ARA "Veinticinco de Mayo" with her A-4Qs. The sinking of the Argentine cruiser ARA "General Belgrano" by the fast attack submarine HMS "Conqueror" showed that capital ships were vulnerable in nuclear submarines' hunting grounds.
Operations in the Persian Gulf.
The U.S. has also made use of carriers in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan and to protect its interests in the Pacific. During the 2003 invasion of Iraq U.S. aircraft carriers served as the primary base of American air power. Even without the ability to place significant numbers of aircraft in Middle Eastern airbases, the United States was capable of carrying out significant air attacks from carrier-based squadrons. Recently, U.S. aircraft carriers such as the provided air support for counter-insurgency operations in Iraq.

Terry Pettus

Terry Pettus (August 15, 1904 – October 1984) was a newspaper reporter and activist from Seattle, Washington.
Biography.
Originally from Terre Haute, Indiana, son of a Christian Socialist, Pettus worked briefly as a reporter in Minneapolis and in Grand Forks, North Dakota, before moving to Seattle with his wife Berta in 1927. Shortly after arrival in Seattle, they lodged with artist Kenneth Callahan; Pettus went to work for the "Seattle Star".
In 1935, as a reporter for the "Tacoma Tribune" he became Washington State's first member of the American Newspaper Guild. In February 1936 he was asked by the Guild to organize its Seattle chapter. By the end of the year, this had led to the first successful strike to gain union recognition for workers at a Hearst newspaper (the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer"). (David Selvin of the Pacific Coast Labor Bureau also played a key role in these events.)
The "Tacoma Tribune" closed its doors shortly thereafter. Pettus worked for a time in South Bend, Washington, editing the "Willapa Harbor Pilot" and becoming involved with the left-wing Washington Commonwealth Federation, initially in a drive for public power. Increasingly radicalized by the Great Depression, in 1938 Pettus joined the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). He became editor of the Commonwealth Federation's "Washington New Dealer" (from 1943 "New World"). When he tried to enlist to serve in World War II, he was rejected because this work was considered essential to the war effort.
In the late 1930s, in Seattle, Pettus edited the Commonwealth Federation's newspaper and hosted the Seattle-area hootenannies (or "hoots"), which Eric Scigliano describes as "fundraising, consciousness-raising, and hellraising parties" for the federation. Pettus had originally learned the word in Terre Haute, where it meant "a party that just sort of happens" without prior planning and brought it to Seattle. When Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger passed through Seattle, they performed at the hoots; it is believed that they picked up the term "hootenanny" there, and passed it into the broader American vocabulary.
Pettus ran unsuccessfully for Seattle City Council in 1946, finishing last in a field of six contending for three seats. Pettus was named as a member of the Communist Party by former head of the Washington Commonwealth Federation Howard Costigan in February 1948 testimony before the Canwell Committee of the Washington State Legislature.
Blacklisted in the McCarthy Era at the start of the Cold War, Pettus became editor of the "People's World", a newspaper associated with the CPUSA. He was charged in 1952 with conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government, and convicted and sentenced to five years, plus an additional three on contempt charges for refusing to name names. He only actually ever served 60 days, and his conviction was eventually overturned by the United States Supreme Court. Pettus left the CPUSA in 1958.
Back in Seattle, Pettus moved onto a houseboat in 1958 and later played a crucial role in saving Lake Union's houseboats and in preventing the city from dumping sewage directly into the lake. Seattle mayor Charles Royer honored him in 1982 with an official Terry Pettus Day, and in 1985, the year after his death, the city dedicated the small Terry Pettus Park on the shore of Lake Union near one of the houseboat neighborhoods.

Embūte Castle

Embūte Castle ruins are located in Embūte, Latvia (), in the Embūte parish, Vaiņode municipality not far from an ancient castle hill erected by Curonians which was an ancient Curonian settlement and is mentioned in ancient chronicles as a place with strong Curonian resistance to German crusaders.
History.
Embūte Castle was built in the middle of the thirteenth century as residence for the Bishop of Courland. It came in the hands of the Livonian Order for a short period, but in the end of the thirteenth century it again belonged to the bishop. The castle was many times rented in the following centuries. 
In the sixteenth century the castle became a centre of big manors and residence for local German landlords. The castle was destroyed in the Great Northern War. Some documents from the eighteenth century tells, that only the castle walls are preserved. In the same century a manor was erected on the old castle walls. It was expanded in the nineteenth century by demolishing one of the old gate towers.
The last owner of the castle was the widow of Hans von Hahn. The castle burned down in 1920 and the baroness moved to Germany. Local rumours says that the baroness burned the castle to avoid its nationalization by the new Latvian government. During the agrarian reforms in Latvia (1921–1930) all manors and land was nationalized and divided by the Latvian government.
After the Second World War, the local Soviet kolkhoz used stones from the castle as building materials.
Todays Castle.
Embūte Castle ruins are situated far from the main road, in the sparsely populated region of Courland. Today's ruins are surrounded by trees and in quite bad condition. Only fragments of some walls and towers are visible.

Alan Sykes

Sir Alan John Sykes, 1st Baronet (11 April 1868 - 21 May 1950) was an English businessman in the bleaching industry and Conservative politician in Cheshire. 
Sykes was born at Cringle House Cheadle, the second son of Thomas Hardcastle Sykes of the Sykes Bleaching Company and his wife Mary Platt daughter of John Platt MP for Oldham. He was known as Jack. He was left motherless in 1875, and in 1881 went away to Rugby School, following his brothers and cousins. He then went to Oriel College, Oxford and while at Oxford joined the Freemasons, to which he remained deeply committed in his adult life. He entered the family bleaching company at the age of 23 and worked his way through the various departments of the bleachworks before becoming manager. Sykes played cricket for Cheshire Gentlemen and hunted with the Cheshire hounds. He became a Justice of the Peace in 1897 and was active in the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, Cheshire Regiment until 1904. After his father died in 1901, he took on a number of local civic positions in Stockport, becoming treasurer of the Infirmary and a Governor of the Grammar School. Sykes was interested in agriculture, running Edgeley Home Farm and the family's estates in Canada of in Saskatchewan. He travelled extensively in his early years to America and Canada, and also to South Africa, Egypt, India and Russia and was an early enthusiast for motoring and flying. 
In 1907 Sykes was adopted as the Conservative candidate for Knutsford and a year later gave up the management of the Edgeley Bleachworks, while remaining director of the Bleachers' Association. In April 1910, he was appointed deputy lieutenant of Cheshire, and from 1910 to 1911 he was mayor of Stockport, the fourth generation of the family to hold this office. Before and after the first world war, Sykes was a leading Conservative organizer in the North West, chairing the Lancashire and Cheshire Federation of Junior Unionist organization. In January 1910, as a keen Tariff Reformer, he was elected MP for Knutsford, taking control from the Liberal. Unsatisfied with the political support he was receiving from the local press, in 1912 he gained control of the Stockport Advertiser Group, which was in fact owned by Swain & Co under the direction of an uncle. In parliament he kept up persistent questioning in support of local interests, and was a leading member of a group of MPs critical of the Government's neglect of Territorial Army and the Volunteer Forces before and during the First World War. In 1916 he served the Government as commissioner reviewing permits for aliens.
At the beginning of World War I he returned to command the local volunteers as lieutenant-colonel of the reformed 6th Battalion, the Cheshire Regiment TF. He was unfit for active service in 1914 but served as secretary to the County Committee of the Cheshire Volunteer Regiment and Staff commandant from 1916 until the force's disbandment in 1920. He was awarded a baronetcy in June 1917. Sykes resigned as an MP in 1922 but continued to be active in local party organizations. He was chairman of the Cheshire division of the National Union from 1913, of the Lancashire and Cheshire Division of the Conservative Association from 1930 to 1932, of the North West Provincial Association from 1933 to 1947, and of Knutsford Conservative Association 1922-1946. After retiring as an MP, he became involved in the bleaching business again. 
Outside the Bleacher's Association, Sykes held, mostly by inheritance, a number of directorships, of which the principal one was of Williams Deacons Bank held between 1918 and 1948. Others were land holding companies and Swain & Co the newspaper group. He was Chairman of the governors of Stockport Grammar School from 1921 to 1950, Chairman of the Stockport Infirmary from 1918 to 1948, president of Manchester Northern Hospital from 1901 and chairman thereof from 1942 to 1950, chairman of the Ephraim Hallam Trust and president of the Oldham Blue Coat School. As early as 1923 he was noted as holding "more offices than he can remember" He was involved in the local government of Cheadle. For many years he was also president of the Lancashire and Cheshire Economic League and was an early supporter of the FBI and other business associations which the Bleachers' Association had helped to fund. In 1948, he succeeded the 17th Earl of Derby as Grand Superintendent of Lancashire (East Division) Provincial Grand Chapter of the Royal Arch Masons.
He remained a confirmed bachelor, with plutocratic tastes - for example yellow Rolls Royces and annual gastronomic tours of France followed by taking the waters at Vichy. Sykes was the nephew of Richard Sykes the rugby player who founded towns in America and cousin of Sir Percy Sykes the geographer and explorer of central Asia.
Prior to his death he lived at South View Cheadle and was buried in the family vault at Cheadle St Mary's Parish Church graveyard

Deep Fried and Minty Fresh

"Deep Fried and Minty Fresh" is the thirteenth episode in the of the American crime drama "". The episode first aired on February 12, 2009.
Synopsis.
It is a bad night at fast food restaurant Choozy's Chicken: The signature chicken statue crashes through the restaurant's window and Bob Graham, the head manager, is found dead in the kitchen. Langston and Nick examine the area, discovering that someone has been living in the kitchen of the fast food joint. The two find a blood pattern that indicates a body was dragged outside, suggesting that there is a second victim. They follow the blood to the dumpsters and grease containers, but Langston notes that the container for Choozy's chicken is missing—and has been replaced by one for a Chinese restaurant. They also discover skid marks and a side mirror broken off from a vehicle.
Riley looks in the drop safe in Bob's office to see if the restaurant was robbed while Brass talks to Kiwi Long, the usual night manager, who says Bob was covering her shift. She mentions an employee named Elizabeth Martin was closing up the night before, but that she has not been able to reach her. Nick finds blood on a "wet floor" sign in the restaurant while Dr. Robbins conducts the autopsy, determining that a strong blow to the head that severed Bob's spinal cord was the cause of death. Nick and Langston get a lead with the side mirror, leading them to a frat boy named Max Stanton, who has a prior for assault against Bob. A former Choozy's Chicken employee, it quickly becomes evident to the two CSIs that the only thing Max is guilty of is theft: He was attempting to make off with the Choozy Chicken in his truck but failed. The team prints all of the Choozy's Chicken employees, but two are missing: Elizabeth Martin and Gary Comstock. Brass finds evidence that "Elizabeth Martin" is an assumed name, while Wendy finds Gary, a former drug addict, is in the system—and that his epithelials were in a razor found at the restaurant, indicating he was the one living in the kitchen.
Mandy runs the fingerprints found next to the broiler but does not get a match to Bob or any of the employees. She matches prints on Elizabeth Martin's closing receipt to prints on the "wet floor" sign, but without Elizabeth's prints for a comparison, she cannot say for sure that they are Elizabeth's. Riley finds menstrual blood in Bob's office, but no sign a sexual assault or struggle took place.
The team turns to surveillance footage from the nearby Chinese restaurant's camera and sees several people getting out of a van and stealing a grease container. The plates are registered to one Timothy Rand. Langston and Brass go to Rand's house in the desert and find him distilling grease into biodiesel fuel. Langston opens up the container from Choozy's and finds a male body inside. The man is identified as Gary Comstock, and Dr. Robbins determines the man was asphyxiated in hot chicken grease. Hodges finds the remnants of glasses and nine 20-dollar bills in the grease Gary was dumped in.
Langston, Riley and Nick return to the scene and posit that Bob killed Gary and dumped his body, but are baffled by the print next to the broiler, which did not match Bob. Nick asks Mandy to run the print again and she does, noticing this time around that it is inverted because of pressure. Once that is factored in, the print proves to be a match for Bob. Brass calls Nick: INS has found Elizabeth Martin and determined she is an illegal immigrant. Brass questions Elizabeth, whose real name is Rosa Gonzales, and she tells him she was indeed closing the night Bob was killed. Bob claimed her receipts did not add up and forced her to undress so he could do a strip search. Gary walked in and caught him feeling Rosa up and confronted Bob. Bob went after Gary and Rosa dressed and ran out to find Bob winning the fight. She picked up the "wet floor" sign and struck Bob in the head. Gary told her to run and she did. Brass tells her the blow from the "wet floor" sign was not what killed Bob. Langston, Nick and Riley ponder the question and Langston posits that without his glasses (which fell in the chicken grease) and suffering from a blow to the head, Bob's balance may have been off; he likely slipped in the chicken grease and tumbled backwards, hitting his head on the floor hard enough to sever his spinal cord.
Meanwhile, Catherine and Greg investigate the death of Melinda Tucker, who was killed handcuffed to her bed while her husband Scott, a real estate agent, was passed out drunk on the couch. Catherine takes the wine in Scott's glass back for processing, while Greg notices two tubes of toothpaste in the trashcan. Catherine and Langston join Doc Robbins in the autopsy room. Doc takes out the heart and squeezes the contents out. Too everyone's surprise, a blue substance comes out which Langston and Doc describe as "fresh" and "minty". The substance is later tested to be high in fluoride. Hodges confirms her death was due to fluoride poisoning from "toothpaste overdose" and points out that she was fed twice the amount needed to kill a person her size.
Greg and Detective Vartann question Scott, who had the key to the handcuffs in his pocket. He has fallen on hard times and his wife had a large life insurance policy—did he decide to get rid of his wife? Scott claims that he and Melinda had not had sex in months, and also notes that Melinda was a dental hygienist before they married; she would have kicked him where it counted before letting him feed her a fatal amount of toothpaste. Greg starts squeezing out the toothpaste from the Tuckers' home, but stops when Hodges tells him and Catherine that the toothpaste that killed Melinda had a bleaching agent in it, which the toothpaste the Tuckers had did not.
Catherine and Greg return to the Tucker house but do not find any toothpaste with whitening on the premises. Greg notices a shoe mark on the fence and thinks to check the eighty-year-old neighbor's trash—and comes up with two tubes of whitening toothpaste and a pair of used latex gloves.
Back at the lab, Greg makes a startling discovery: the DNA in the gloves is Melinda's. She fed herself a fatal dose of toothpaste, spiked her husband's wine and then handcuffed herself to the bed to frame him for murder. Scott tells Catherine that his wife was deeply unhappy when his clients started to lose their houses and blamed the Tuckers. The clients she had socialized with and became friends with blamed her, and she blamed Scott. Dr. Robbins approaches Ray; he has found a space in the morgue he can use for an office. It is not much, but Ray is quite pleased with the accommodations.
Controversy.
Writer and producer of the episode, Sarah Goldfinger, was sued for defamation of character by California real estate agents, Melinda and Scott Tamkin. The Tamkins allege that Goldfinger, in an act of revenge from a failed buy that Goldfinger had attempted some years before, wrote the Tucker characters in their image, though created them lacking morals. These characters, the Tamkins surmise, hurt their business by turning people away once potential customers realize the similarities.

This can take the form of whole stumps, logs, pieces of bark or even worked timber such as railway sleepers or floorboards. The pieces are arranged artistically and plants, typically ferns, mosses and lichens are encouraged to grow around or on them. They provide a feature for the garden and a habitat for several types of wildlife. The first stumpery was built in 1856 at Biddulph Grange and they remained popular in Victorian Britain.
A stumpery traditionally consists of tree stumps arranged upside-down or on their sides to show the root structure but logs, driftwood or large pieces of bark can also be used. The stumps can be used individually or attached together to form a structure such as a wall or arch. Stumperies can vary in size from a handful of logs to large displays containing dozens of full tree stumps. The use of storm-damaged or diseased trees is not uncommon and can save the landowner the cost of their removal. Where tree stumps are unavailable a more modern, angular look can be achieved by using railway sleepers or old oak floorboards and some companies sell waste timber or driftwood specifically for the purpose of constructing stumperies. Plants such as ferns, mosses and lichens are often encouraged to grow around and on the stumpery. Stumperies provide a home for wildlife and have been known to host stag beetles, toads and small mammals.
Stumperies have been described as "Victorian horticultural oddities" and were popular features of 19th-century gardens. The reasons for their popularity vary but it may be a result of the Romantic Movement which emphasised the beauty of nature. Their popularity may also be attributed to the increasing popularity of ferns as garden plants at the time. Ferns were very fashionable and hundreds of new species were introduced to Britain from around the world. The stumpery made an ideal habitat for these shade-loving plants. Additionally stumperies may have been used in place of rockeries in areas where suitable rocks were in short supply. Their popularity is once again on the rise.
The first stumpery to be built, at Biddulph Grange, Staffordshire, in 1856, was designed by the artist and gardener Edward William Cooke for the estate's owner James Bateman. The stumpery at Biddulph Grange consists of stumps placed into a wall either side of a garden path and used as a scaffold for the growth of ferns. A famous modern stumpery is that at Highgrove House, Gloucestershire, the home of Prince Charles, which is considered to be the largest stumpery in Britain. The Prince built the stumpery from sweet chestnut roots, held in place by steel bars, when he first purchased the estate in 1980, and it now provides a home for organically grown ferns, hellebores and hostas. The largest stumpery in the United States is at Vashon Island in Washington. It rivals the Highgrove stumpery in size, measuring and including around 95 separate tree stumps. Stumperies can sometimes be mistaken for garden rubbish; indeed, when Prince Philip first saw his son's stumpery, he remarked: "When are you going to set fire to this lot?".

Sodium cellulose phosphate

Sodium cellulose phosphate is a drug used to treat hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. It has been used to prevent kidney stones. 
This compound is an ion-exchange resin that can not be absorbed by the body. However, it can be used to restore the normal intestinal calcium absorption. When it is taken orally, it binds strongly to calcium and inhibits its absorption into the blood. From there, inhibition is caused due to the lower intraluminal calcium levels, which is typically available for absorption. 
The mechanism of action of the drug compound can cause a couple of internal effects. Due to the binding activity of the compound with calcium, it will also bind with magnesium and cause a depletion in the body. Working off of this effect, sodium cellulose phosphate will bind with divalent intestinal cations. Because of this binding, more oxalate is available in the blood. This high level of oxalate within the intestine can also be a source of renal stones.
Studies.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, physiological action studies took place to show how intestinal calcium was absorbed and how it affects other functions within the body. By a study done at the University of Texas, it was found that sodium cellulose phosphate inhibited calcium absorption through three separate techniques.
Through these studies, major conclusions were made regarding the drug compound. Sodium cellulose phosphate reduces the renal excretion of magnesium and calcium. Phosphate and oxalate were both increased in the urine, one due to intestinal hydrolysis and the other to a reduced oxalate complex. Overall, it was noted that the drug could be used to correct the increased calcium absorption that occurs in absorptive hypercalciuria.
Calcibind.
The major US dosage form of sodium cellulose phosphate is Calcibind, which was developed and brought to market by Mission Pharma. Calcibind is a powder dosage form, which comes in small, 2.5 gram doses, individually packaged. The patent for this product was approved on December 28, 1982. The product was eventually removed from the market for reasons that have not been found at this time.
Hypercalcemia.
This condition occurs when there is a raised level of calcium in the blood, compared to the normal range of 2.2–2.6 mmol/L. Typical symptoms of this condition include renal stones, bone pain, abdominal discomfort, and nausea/vomiting. More severe symptoms are associated with psychiatric overtones which are consumed with anxiety, depression, and insomnia.
Hypercalciuria.
Hypercalciuria occurs when there is an elevated level of calcium in the urine. This condition is due to severe calcium reabsorption within the intestines.

United States Penitentiary, Beaumont

The United States Penitentiary, Beaumont (USP Beaumont) is a high-security United States federal prison for male inmates in Texas. It is part of the Federal Correctional Complex, Beaumont (FCC Beaumont) and is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice.
FCC Beaumont is located approximately east of Houston.
Notable incidents.
2007 inmate murder.
On November 28, 2007, correction officers were escorting inmates Mark Snarr and Edgar Garcia to their cells at the USP Beaumont. When they arrived, Snarr and Garcia slipped from their restraints, repeatedly stabbed both correction officers with homemade prison knives known as shanks, and took the officers' cell keys.
Snarr and Garcia then unlocked the cell of inmate Gabriel Rhone and stabbed Rhone over 50 times. Additional officers arrived and used chemical agents to stop the attack, which lasted several minutes and was captured on surveillance camera. The wounded corrections officers and Rhone were transported to a local hospital, where Rhone was pronounced dead. The officers were treated and survived.
Attorneys for Snarr and Garcia claimed that Rhone had repeatedly threatened to kill their clients and that prison officials had failed to respond to those threats. However, Snarr and Garcia were subsequently convicted of murder and both were sentenced to death on May 24, 2010. They are currently being held at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, a high-security facility in Indiana which houses federal death row.
2008 inmate murder.
On February 12, 2008, USP Beaumont staff discovered the body of a 29-year-old inmate, Ronald Joseph, in his cell. An autopsy showed that Joseph died from asphyxia due to ligature strangulation or compression of the neck. Further investigation identified James Sweeney and Harry Lee Napper, both inmates at USP Beaumont, as suspects in the murder. Sweeney and Napper were indicted and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and second-degree murder on May 4, 2011. In 2012, Sweeney pleaded guilty to racketeering and murder charges for leading the prison gang Dead Man Incorporated in exchange for the murder charge being dismissed and was sentenced to life in prison. Napper received a decades-long sentence.

Margaret Skinnider

Margaret Skinnider (28 May 1892 – 10 October 1971) was a revolutionary and feminist born in Coatbridge, Scotland. She fought during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin. Her part in the Easter Rising was all the more notable because she was a woman, a sniper and the only female wounded in the action. She was mentioned three times for bravery in the dispatches sent to the Dublin GPO.
Early life.
Skinnider was born in 1893 to Irish parents in the Lanarkshire town of Coatbridge. She trained as a mathematics teacher and joined Cumann na mBan in Glasgow, she was also involved in the women's suffrage movement in Glasgow. Ironically she had learned to shoot in a rifle club which had originally been set up so that women could help in defence of the British Empire. During her trips to Ireland Skinnider came under the influence of Constance Markievicz and became active in smuggling detonators and bomb-making equipment into Dublin (in her hat) in preparation for the 1916 Easter Rising. She along with Madeleine french-Mullen spent time in the hills around Dublin testing dynamite. 
When Skinnider was shown "the poorest part of Dublin" by Constance Markievicz, she wrote; "I do not believe there is a worse place in the world." The street was "a hollow full of sewage and refuse", and the building "as full of holes as if it had been under shellfire".
Easter Rising.
Operating variously as a scout, message runner (often dressed as a boy) and sniper Skinnider
took part in action against the British Army at the Garrison at the College of Surgeons and St. Stephen's Green under
the Command of General Michael Mallin and Constance Markievicz. Skinnider was reportedly an excellent markswoman. She was seriously wounded when she was shot three times attempting to burn down houses on Harcourt Street to try to cut off the retreat of British soldiers who had planted a machine gun post on the roof of the University Church.
Nora Connolly describes Skinnider's leading role in this action;
In her autobiography "Doing my bit for Ireland" (New York – Century, 1917) Skinnider herself vividly describes her role as a sniper at St. Stephen's Green in the Easter Rising:
In terms of her role as a woman taking part in military action Skinnider comments: 
The current president of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, quoted Skinnider's stirring words in his 2006 address to the Sinn Féin Ard Feis.
Initially imprisoned and seriously injured, Skinnider spent several weeks in hospital before she contrived to escape whilst awaiting medical treatment and obtained a travel permit from Dublin Castle to enable her to return to her native Scotland.
Post-1916 activities.
Skinnider returned to Dublin later that year before fleeing to America in fear of internment. Whilst in America, she collected funds for the republican cause and lectured with other women who had fought in the Easter Rising. Skinnider also wrote and published her autobiography in New York – "Doing my Bit for Ireland". Skinnider later returned to Ireland and took up a teaching post in Dublin in 1917. During the War of Independence she was arrested and imprisoned. In the civil war she became Paymaster General of the Irish Republican Army until she was arrested in 1923
Later life.
After her release from prison, she worked as a teacher at Kings Inn Street Sisters of Charity Primary School in Dublin until her retirement in 1961. She was a member of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) throughout her teaching career. She became its President in 1956. During her tenure she represented Ireland at the World Conference of the Organisation of the Teaching Professions in Manila, Philippines. She fought in particular for the rights of women – this agitation resulted in the introduction of common incremental salary sales for women and single men in 1949. She lived her last years in Glenageary, County Dublin. She died on 10 October 1971 and was buried in the Republican plot in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball Flying High

Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball Flying High () is a 1991 Swedish animated feature film directed by Jan Gissberg after an original script by Thomas Funck, using Funck's already well-established characters. It follows a shorter film made by the same team in 1987, "Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball". This is the first time since before 1954 where a Kalle Stropp production features voice acting by others than only Funck himself, only with the exception of children that had participated in other productions as well. Also notable is that The Hen, one of the prominent characters in the Kalle Stropp canon, does not appear.
Synopsis.
Something strange has been spotted over the tree tops in the forest where Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball live, and Plåt-Niklas quickly builds a monocular to examine it. It turns out to be an emergency signal and the two friends together with Plåt-Niklas and The Parrot set out on an expedition to resque whoever is sending the signal.
While crossing a stream, though, Froggy Ball falls down a small waterfall and ends up in a dark cave. While looking for a way out he stumbles upon the Cone People who live there and quickly befriends the Cone King and Queen. In the meantime Charlie Strap has met up with Kottegrön, a young and impulsive female cone, and soon joins Froggy Ball and the others. It turns out that the Cone People are the ones who have been sending the signal, and when elevated up to a tree top Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball see a helicopter landing, with three evil businessmen from the company Tonto-Turbo who are planning to tear down a huge part of the forest. When the businessmen leave, Kottegrön ends up being with them on the helicopter.
Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball hang on to the landing skids, but eventually fall off high up in the air over a lake. Luckily it turns out that Charlie's tailcoat can be used as a parachute, and Froggy Ball even learns how to steer it by pulling the tails so they can land on a steam boat. On the boat Plåt-Niklas and The Parrot succeed to locate them so they can join them again.
The boat takes them to Gripsholm Castle, which turns out to be where the businessmen were heading too, as their full plan is to move the old castle to the cleared space in the forest and turn it into a hyper modern luxury hotel, replacing most of its walls and floors with glass. This will be made possible by hacking the authorities' computers with a special program they are keeping on a floppy disk. Kottegrön, who has been hiding in a briefcase, tries to steal the disk but fails. Instead she, Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball end up on the bottom of the castle well, but are soon resqued by Plåt-Niklas who has the ability to fly. In the meantime the men from Tonto-Turbo leave again in their helicopter. Plåt-Niklas calculates that they are heading to the city, before he flies back to the cone forest with Kottegrön.
In the city, Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball walk up to Tonto-Turbo's central office and confront them, but are simply laughed at and disregarded. The businessmen then head off to the Nobel party where they have been invited. The two friends, left in the office, discover that the men forgot to bring the floppy disk with them. They try to find out which one of the disks at the office it is that is the real one, and while trying one in the computer the frog ends up inside of a computer game and Charlie has to control him into safety with the joystick. Soon after that, one of the men returns - and takes the right disk with him.
Unable to get into the Nobel party, Froggy Ball is ready to give up when a submarine appears. Out of it come Plåt-Niklas and Kottegrön who have returned. Through the kitchen they smuggle themselves into the party by hiding in the dessert - an ice cream parade. When inside Froggy Ball holds a speech where he accuses the men from Tonto-Turbo in public. The atmosphere becomes confused, and the men capture the two friends and decide to get rid of them once and for all. But then suddenly The Fox, who had previously only been seen in a short cameo in the very beginning of the story, arrives and causes disruption. While the men are distracted everybody can escape, and Kottegrön steals the floppy disk. After a wild chase though, the men recapture the disk, but only to see an army of cones arrive and chase them into the water, where also the disk is dropped by The Parrot.
Back in the cone forest the frog is awarded a prize from the hands of the cone Minister of Flower Pots and the businessmen are given a new profession - shaving sheep, which they seem to enjoy.
Production.
In the early 1980s "Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball" were frequently featured in various Swedish radio series during the summers. It was when listening to one of these Jan Gissberg got the idea of making an animated film about them and contacted Thomas Funck. Together they discussed the desirable appearances of the characters and settings. The project was to be produced by Gissberg's own recently started animation studio, Cinemation Industries, where also his brother Peter Gissberg worked as a background artist. Around Christmas 1987 a short film was released, but already a year prior to that, they had begun working on a script for a feature-length film. In 1987 they started the process of making it, using a budget of 13 million SEK.
Reception.
The general Swedish reception was positive, with more or less a critical consensus claiming that it stood out as the winner among the films competing over a similar target audience, being released around the same time as "Rock-A-Doodle", "The Rescuers Down Under" and "". The playful style and rich ideas were complimented, and the poetic background art by Peter Gissberg was particularly praised.
"Dagens Nyheter" claimed that although it might lack the virtuosity of Disney's films, it is to its credit that it also lacks their sentimentality and delight for violence. And further, that it is "pretty sophisticated when it allows the sportively drawn characters to appear against a backdrop of aquarellic soft nature poetry, signed by Peter Gissberg."

Bird Day

Bird Day is the name of several holidays celebrating birds. The first such holiday was established by Charles Almanzo Babcock, the Oil City superintendent of schools, in 1894.
Bird Day is a holiday established by Oil City, Pennsylvania school superintendent Charles Babcock in 1894. It was the first holiday in the United States dedicated to the celebration of birds. Babcock intended it to advance bird conservation as a moral value. It is celebrated on May 4 of every year.
International Migratory Bird Day.
International Migratory Bird Day is a conservation initiative that brings awareness on conserving migratory birds and their habitats throughout the Western Hemisphere. This program is dedicated to international conservation efforts and environmental education in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Originated by the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, it is now coordinated by Environment for the Americas.
International Migratory Bird Day (IMBD) officially takes place on the second Saturday in May in the U.S. and Canada and on the second Saturday of October in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean each year. Recognizing that this date does not work well for all places or for the migratory birds themselves- sites host these programs at their convenience throughout the year.
This program engages the general public to care about maintaining healthy bird populations and protecting breeding, non-breeding, and stop over habitats used by migratory birds. International Migratory Bird Day programs often are informal science education or informal science learning activities such as bird walks, art competitions, nature based festivals, and presentations. These programs take place in a variety of settings such as zoos, aquariums, protected lands, biospheres, museums, and schools.
Every year International Migratory Bird Day has a new conservation theme with corresponding artwork, educational materials, and activities.

National Bird Day.
National Bird Day is an annual holiday with half a million adherents who celebrate through birdwatching, studying birds, bird drinking games including 'bird date' and other bird-related activities. Bird adoption is a particularly important National Bird Day activity. According to the newspaper "Atlanta Journal-Constitution", many bird enthusiasts celebrate by adopting birds and by educating future bird owners about the special issues involved with taking care of birds, including their "screaming, biting, constant cleanups, the need for daily interaction and a varied diet". National Bird Day takes place every year on January 5.
"Bird Day" in the United Kingdom.
Since 1979, bird lovers in the United Kingdom have taken part in the annual Big Garden Birdwatch. In the annual event coordinated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, up to half a million people spend an hour counting birds. In 2009 the Big Garden Birdwatch was referred to as "Bird Day" the "The Scotsman" newspaper.
"Bird Day" in Pakistan as Panchi Mela™(c) Family Festival.
Since 2013, bird lovers in Pakistan have taken part in the Avari Gardens. In the annual event coordinated by the Panchi Virsa.

PhyloXML

PhyloXML is an XML language for the analysis, exchange, and storage of phylogenetic trees (or networks) and associated data. The structure of phyloXML is described by XML Schema Definition (XSD) language.
A shortcoming of current formats for describing phylogenetic trees (such as Nexus and Newick/New Hampshire) is a lack of a standardized means to annotate tree nodes and branches with distinct data fields (which in the case of a basic species tree might be: species names, branch lengths, and possibly multiple support values). Data storage and exchange is even more cumbersome in studies in which trees are the result of a reconciliation of some kind:
To alleviate this, a variety of ad-hoc, special purpose formats have come into use (such as the NHX format, which focuses on the needs of gene-function and phylogenomic studies).
A well defined XML format addresses these problems in a general and extensible manner and allows for interoperability between specialized and general purpose software.
An example of a program for visualizing phyloXML is Archaeopteryx.

Buried Alive (2007 film)

Buried Alive is a 2007 horror film starring Terence Jay, Leah Rachel, and Tobin Bell, about a group of college students stalked by a vengeful spirit during a New Mexico road trip. It was a straight-to-DVD release distributed by Dimension Extreme. This film was a Blockbuster Exclusive.
Plot.
The film opens with Rene (Leah Rachel) in the bath, with her cousin, Zane (Terence Jay) also in the bathroom, and they have a conversation. Suddenly, he pushes her underwater, and she begins to drown. While looking up at his face from under the water, she sees the visage of an old woman above her. She then wakes up, and we find out that she has fallen asleep and begun to drown. Her boyfriend Danny (Steve Sandvoss) wakes her up, and the two make out.
The scene then switches to Zane, who has enlisted the help of dorky nerd Phil (Germaine De Leon) to research his family history. Zane decides to visit his family home, bringing Phil, Rene, Danny, and her two sorority pledges, Julie "Cow" (Lindsey Scott) and Laura "Dog" (Erin Michelle Lokitz). The two pledges have been forced to dress up as animals (cow and dog respectively) and are being brought to Zane's family home as an initiation. On the way to the cabin, Zane constantly sees an old woman on the side of the road, culminating in her appearance in the middle of the road, which causes him to almost crash. He decides she is a hallucination, and continues on to his family's land.
Lester (Tobin Bell), the caretaker of the house, has been living in a trailer on the land, and searching for gold. It appears that he has found some, but does not tell anyone when they arrive. The college students marvel at his stuffed oddities, as he has become an amateur taxidermist. He warns the group not to go into the subcellar, or to go outside after dark. Zane does not take his warnings seriously, and they continue on to the house. 
Settling in, Rene enslaves Julie and Laura and forces Phil to tell how he knows so much about Rene and Zane's family history. Phil goes outside to get a signal on his mobile phone, but is split in half by the ghost with an axe.
Thinking Phil is sitting in the car talking on his phone, the five remaining teens decide to learn more about the family history. After that, Rene decides to have a little fun with Julie and Laura by setting them a task; they must run to Lester's caravan and bring back one of his stuffed animals as proof they were there. They must wear one item of clothing and it can't be an overcoat. Julie chooses to wear her pants and Laura chooses to wear her boots, and although Laura accomplishes the task, Julie doesn't because she sprains her ankle. Rene says that she was once given the task but had to go three blocks, down fraternity row, and that she chose to wear a ski mask.
Rene decides to give Julie one more task, and that's to take off her clothes, except for her underclothes, and blindfold her. Rene takes Zane's belt and uses it on Julie as a test of trust. Soon, Rene and Laura depart Julie and leave her standing there. Danny decides to go get Phil but finds out that he's dead before he gets his face cut off. When the lights go out, Zane goes out to check the machine to find it's still functioning normally, but the cable was cut. Zane finds Danny's faceless body, as do Rene and Laura. Zane, Rene and Laura dash back inside the house, thinking Lester is behind Danny's murder, but they find Lester dead as well.
They try to escape with their car, but its sabotaged. They grab Lester's keys and Laura dashes to Lester's caravan to get his truck. While Zane and Rene are still in the house, Zane gets locked in another room and Rene is knocked unconscious with the spirit scratching the words "Sins Of The Father" on her back. Zane finally breaks through and kills the woman, but when barricading themselves in a room, the woman appears and knocks Zane unconscious.
Laura returns with Lester's truck and the woman is about to slaughter Laura, but disappears after seeing a tattoo that's similar to the necklace Rene had throughout the movie. Laura escapes and Rene and Zane wake to find themselves in some kind of box. The old woman quickly grabs the necklace and drops the gold ring taken by the caretaker in the beginning of the movie. Rene and Zane scream in fear as the old woman buries them alive.
Reception.
"Buried Alive" was met with negative reviews, earning Rotten Tomatoes an approval rating of 17%. David Nusair of Film Reel Reviews quoted that "aside from the admittedly effective casting of Tobin Bell from "Saw" as a crazy old coot, "Buried Alive" is conspicuously lacking in overtly positive elements."

Paul Robeson, Jr.

Paul Robeson, Jr. (November 2, 1927 – April 26, 2014) was an American author, archivist and historian.
Biography.
Robeson was born in Brooklyn to entertainer and activist Paul Robeson and Eslanda Goode Robeson. As his family moved to Europe he grew up in England and Moscow, in the Soviet Union. In Moscow he attended an elite school. The Robesons returned to the United States in 1938 to live first in Harlem, New York, and after 1941 in Enfield, Connecticut. Robeson, Jr. graduated from Enfield High School and attended Cornell University where he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering in 1949. He died of lymphoma in 2014.
Paul Robeson, Sr. legacy.
Robeson maintained on many occasions that his father ""never joined the Communist Party or any party for that matter -- he was an independent artist and would never submit to any kind of organizational discipline."" 
On his own politics he stated: ""I was much more an organized political person"", he said, adding that from about 1948 to 1962, he was a member of the Communist Party. ""It was an instrument, a radical instrument that could help advance the interests of African-Americans. It helped build the early civil-rights movement and independent trade union movement in the 1930s, '40s and '50s."" He said he left the party in 1962 after ""it became bureaucratic and corrupt"".
Robeson's father, Paul Sr., was one of his closest friends and protectors, traveling and living with him intermittently during his life. Following his father's death, Robeson Jr. worked extensively to establish the Paul Robeson Archive and the Paul Robeson Foundation. The archive, currently housed at Howard University's Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, is the largest repository in the Western hemisphere of Robeson documents and articles, totaling well over 50,000 items. He is of Igbo descent through his father.

History of Python

The history of the Python programming language dates back to the late 1980s.
Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, "Benevolent Dictator for Life" (BDFL).
Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features including a full garbage collector and support for unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process. Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on 3 December 2008 after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.
First publication.
In February 1991, Van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources. Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as "one of Python's major programming units". Python's exception model also resembles Modula-3's, with the addition of an codice_4 clause. In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python's userbase.
Version release dates.
Release dates for the major and minor versions:
Version 1.0.
Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools codice_5, codice_6, codice_7 and codice_8. Van Rossum stated that "Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches".
The last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia whence he released several versions.
By version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp's keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.
During Van Rossum's stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic "literacy" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E's goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA. , the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, reaching out to non-programmers is not an active concern.
BeOpen.
In 2000, the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. CNRI requested that a version 1.6 be released, summarizing Python's development up to the point at which the development team left CNRI. Consequently, the release schedules for 1.6 and 2.0 had a significant amount of overlap. Python 2.0 was the only release from BeOpen.com. After Python 2.0 was released by BeOpen.com, Guido van Rossum and the other PythonLabs developers joined Digital Creations.
The Python 1.6 release included a new CNRI license that was substantially longer than the CWI license that had been used for earlier releases. The new license included a clause stating that the license was governed by the laws of the State of Virginia. The Free Software Foundation argued that the choice-of-law clause was incompatible with the GNU GPL. BeOpen, CNRI, and the FSF negotiated a change to Python's free software license that would make it GPL-compatible. Python 1.6.1 is essentially the same as Python 1.6, with a few minor bug fixes, and with the new GPL-compatible license.
Version 2.0.
Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions, a feature borrowed from the functional programming languages SETL and Haskell. Python's syntax for this construct is very similar to Haskell's, apart from Haskell's preference for punctuation characters and Python's preference for alphabetic keywords. Python 2.0 also introduced a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles.
Python 2.1 was close to Python 1.6.1, as well as Python 2.0. Its license was renamed Python Software Foundation License. All code, documentation and specifications added, from the time of Python 2.1's alpha release on, is owned by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit organization formed in 2001, modeled after the Apache Software Foundation. The release included a change to the language specification to support nested scopes, like other statically scoped languages. (The feature was turned off by default, and not required, until Python 2.2.)
A major innovation in Python 2.2 was the unification of Python's types (types written in C) and classes (types written in Python) into one hierarchy. This single unification made Python's object model purely and consistently object oriented. Also added were generators which were inspired by Icon.
Version 3.0.
Python 3.0 (also called "Python 3000" or "Py3K") was designed to rectify certain fundamental design flaws in the language (the changes required could not be implemented while retaining full backwards compatibility with the 2.x series, which necessitated a new major version number). The guiding principle of Python 3 was: "reduce feature duplication by removing old ways of doing things".
Philosophy.
Python 3.0 was developed with the same philosophy as in prior versions. However, as Python had accumulated new and redundant ways to program the same task, Python 3.0 had an emphasis on removing duplicative constructs and modules, in keeping with "There should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it".
Nonetheless, Python 3.0 remained a multi-paradigm language. Coders still had options among object-orientation, structured programming, functional programming and other paradigms, but within such broad choices, the details were intended to be more obvious in Python 3.0 than they were in Python 2.x.
Timeline and compatibility.
Python 3.0 was released on December 3, 2008.
The Python 2.x and Python 3.x series were planned to coexist for several releases in parallel, with the 2.x series existing largely for compatibility and with some new features being backported from the 3.x series.
Python 2.6 was released to coincide with Python 3.0, and included some features from that release, as well as a "warnings" mode that highlighted the use of features that were removed in Python 3.0.
Similarly, Python 2.7 coincided with and included features from Python 3.1, which was released on June 26, 2009.
Python 2.7 was the last release in the 2.x series; parallel releases ceased as of Python 3.2.
Python 3.0 broke backward compatibility. There was no requirement that Python 2.x code would run unmodified on Python 3.0. There were basic changes such as changing the print statement into a print function (so any use of print as a statement will cause the program to fail), and switching to Unicode for all text strings. Python's dynamic typing combined with the plans to change the semantics of certain methods of dictionaries, for example, made perfect mechanical translation from Python 2.x to Python 3.0 very difficult. However, a tool called "2to3" could do most of the job of translation, pointing out areas of uncertainty using comments or warnings. Even in an alpha stage, 2to3 appeared to be fairly successful at performing the translation. For projects requiring compatibility with both the 2.x and 3.x series, the Python development team recommended keeping one source (for the 2.x series), and producing releases for the Python 3.x platform using 2to3. Edits to the Python 3.x code were discouraged for so long as the code needed to run on Python 2.x.
Features.
Some of the major changes scheduled for Python 3.0 were:
Subsequent releases in the Python 3.x series have included additional, substantial new features; all ongoing development of the language is done in the 3.x series.
Influences from other languages.
Python's core syntax and certain aspects of its philosophy are directly inherited from ABC. C provided some of Python's syntax, and the Bourne shell served as the model for an interpreter that becomes interactive when run without arguments. List comprehensions, anonymous functions, lexical closures and the map function are among the major features borrowed from functional languages, primarily dialects of Lisp and Haskell. Generators and iterators were inspired by Icon, and were then fused with the functional programming ideas borrowed into a unified model. Modula-3 was the basis of the exception model and module system. Perl lent Python regular expressions, used for string manipulation. Python's standard library additions and syntactical choices were strongly influenced by Java in some cases: the codice_18 package, introduced in version 2.3, the codice_19 package for multithreaded applications, the SAX parser, introduced in 2.0, and the decorator syntax that uses codice_20, added in version 2.4

CGU plc

CGU plc was a large insurance group, created by the merger of Commercial Union and General Accident. The Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange.
History.
The Company was created by the 1998 merger of Commercial Union and General Accident.
Commercial Union.
Commercial Union was established following a conflagration in London's dockland in 1861, known as the Great Tooley Street Fire, which destroyed a number of warehouses and wharves along the River Thames as a result of which the fire insurance companies were hit by a series of massive claims. Consequently they increased their fire insurance rates so dramatically that a group of local merchants and brokers decided to form their own company. This became known as the "Commercial Union Assurance Company Ltd."
It purchased the Hand in Hand Fire & Life Insurance Society, the world's oldest fire insurance company, in 1905 and The Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation Ltd. in 1910 and it continued to grow by further acquisitions.
General Accident.
General Accident was a financial services firm formed by several mergers and acquisitions over several years. the "General Accident and Employers' Liability Assurance Association Ltd." was founded in Perth, Scotland in 1885. It became the "General Accident Assurance Corporation Ltd." in 1891.
General Accident acquired Yorkshire Insurance Company Ltd. in 1967. All general insurance business was relocated to Perth, with York becoming the centre for the new firm's life assurance and pensions business.
General Accident acquired Stevenage-based Provident Mutual Life Assurance Association in 1995, merging it with the GA Life and Pensions business as Provident Mutual Life Assurance Ltd. York became the centre of all life assurance business and Stevenage of all pensions business.
Aviva reintroduced the General Accident brand in April 2013. The new General Accident brand is aimed at customers who use car insurance price comparison sites.
Norwich Union merger.
The Company merged with Norwich Union in 2000 to form CGNU plc, later renamed Aviva plc.
In the US, the CGU casualty and property businesses were purchased by White Mountains Insurance Group; the name of the Company has since changed to "OneBeacon Insurance Company".

Political funding in the United Kingdom

Political funding in the United Kingdom has been a source of controversy for many years. There are three main ways a political party is funded. The first is through membership subs; the second is through donations; and for opposition members the third is through state funding (though only for administrative costs). The general restrictions in the UK were held in "Bowman v United Kingdom" to be fully compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, article 10.
History.
Starting in 2006, political funding came under scrutiny as concerns grew that the largest British political parties were too dependent on a handful of wealthy donors. Furthermore, during the Cash for Honours scandal, concern grew even more. A concern of the 1970s had been that the major parties were unable to raise sufficient funds to operate successfully.
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA) was an act that established the Electoral Commission and required all political parties to register with it, set down accounting requirements for political parties, and introduced controls on donations.
2006 Sir Hayden Phillips inquiry.
In March 2006, former civil servant Sir Hayden Phillips was charged with setting up an inquiry to come up with proposal for reform. It reported a year later. He recommended capping individual donations at £50,000 and capping spending for political campaigns. He also suggested increasing state funding by £25m and expanding its reach.
2008 Ministry of Justice report.
In June 2008, the Ministry of Justice released a white paper analyzing party finance and expenditure. The paper proposed to tighten controls on spending by parties and candidates, substantially strengthen the powers of the Electoral Commission, and increase the transparency of donations.
Membership subscriptions.
Membership subscriptions ("subs") provide one source of funding for political parties. However, in recent times membership has declined and campaign costs have grown.
Donations.
The Conservative Party relies on donations mostly from individuals and companies; as well as these sources the Labour Party receives a significant portion of its donations from trade unions. For example, in the third quarter of 2009, eighteen political parties reported donations totalling £9,532,598 (excluding public funds). The Conservative Party received £5,269,186, the Labour party received £3,045,377 and the Liberal Democrat party received £816,663. Donations typically peak before elections. Between the 6th of April and the 6th of May 2010 (a general election campaign month) the Conservatives took £7,317,602, Labour £5,283,199 and the Liberal Democrats £724,000.
State funding.
Opposition parties receive state funding to pay administration cost; Short Money in the House of Commons starting in 1975, and Cranborne Money in the House of Lords starting in 1996.
In addition there is a general policy development grant available to parties with two MPs or one MP and one MEP.
Transparency.
Donations worth over £5,000 to national parties must be declared, as must be donations worth £1,000 or more to local associations.
For a while as a loophole, loans did not have to be declared.

House model

A house model (also known as a "mannequin") is a fashion model who works exclusively or near-exclusively for a particular fashion brand, house or label. A house model can also be associated with specific cosmetic or perfume brands.
Pre-1945.
The role of the house model began to be clearly defined in the mid-19th century, when Charles Frederick Worth gained a reputation for showing his designs to prospective clients upon live models. Worth's own wife, Marie Vernet, had been a model for the Parisian drapers Gagelin and Opigez before their marriage, and she continued to act as a model for Worth's early designs.
The London couturier Lucile, is widely credited with training the first professional fashion models in about 1897. She is also linked with the first runway or "catwalk" fashion shows. The use of live models as mannequins became increasingly popular throughout the 1910s, leading to those that followed the trend such as Georges Doeuillet of Paris becoming noted for it.
By the 1920s, it was standard practice for fashion houses to employ in-house mannequins. Such a profession was considered normal enough to be the job of the heroine of the 1927 Alfred Hitchcock film .
Post-1945.
From the late 1940s, individual house models began to become well known by their names or professional names. They could also move from one house to another. "Lucky" (Lucie Daouphars (ca.1922-1963)) was originally a house model for Jacques Fath before becoming the top house model for Christian Dior. Dior gained a reputation for his line-up of dedicated house models, all of whom he gave nicknames (including "Alla" and "Victoire").
Dior's house models would also model for fashion photographs, although this was not standard practice. Many photographers preferred photographic models such as Dovima, who were not affiliated with any specific fashion house. One of the few exceptions to this rule was Joanna Lumley, who worked as a house model for Jean Muir in the mid to late 1960s, and was frequently photographed wearing Muir's designs.
Some house models gained insight into the fashion trade through their jobs, and went on to become designers in their own right, such as Emmanuelle Khanh, who modelled at Balenciaga and then Givenchy from 1957 to 1963 before launching her ready to wear fashion label.
Present day.
The definition of the house model in the present day is less clear. Couturiers continue to employ house models, although it is rare for the model to be affiliated exclusively to a specific brand or label. A model may be called a house model for a certain designer due to being frequently featured in that designer's advertisements or catwalk shows, without working exclusively for them. For example, Kate Moss's widely known work for Calvin Klein, particularly her "Obsession" advertisements is a small part of a wide-ranging modelling career. Julia Stegner, the house model for Hugo Boss for several seasons, also did modelling work for other fashion houses and brands.
The house model need not be exclusively a model. An actor or celebrity may be invited to act a role similar to that of the house model by being the "public face" of a brand or label. For example, L'Oreal has many "spokespeople" including Andie MacDowell and the Bollywood actor Aishwarya Rai to endorse its beauty products and act as a public face for the company.

Vjekoslav Heinzel

Vjekoslav Heinzel (21 August 1871 – 1 March 1934) was the Mayor of Zagreb from 1920 to 1928. He is best remembered for great development projects of the 1920s that significantly expanded the city.
Heinzel was born into an entrepreneurial family in Zagreb, and was sent to Graz and Stuttgart to become an architect, graduating in 1893. Licensed for standalone work as an architect in 1896, he designed numerous buildings in Zagreb. In 1910, he became a city councillor and in 1912, he became the head of the local Chamber of Trade and Crafts. He same year he ceased his professional activities and traveled across Europe, before he returned and organized the food supply of Zagreb during World War I.
Heinzel was also an early automobilist, who along with Ferdinand Budicki drove the first car in Zagreb, and was one of the founders of the Croatian automobile club in 1906. He participated in many early car races, including winning the first race for the championship of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia in 1912.
During the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Heinzel was first elected mayor in 1920 and served until the August 1921, when the city administration was temporarily disbanded. In 1922, he was elected as a member of the Croatian Bloc. In 1926 and 1927 he had a falling out with the Party of Rights and the Croatian Peasant Party, but was re-elected in the subsequent election. His administration organized the construction of large sections of today's Peščenica, Trnje, Trešnjevka, Maksimir and other city neighborhoods. His contributions included the construction and expansion of numerous hospitals, the beginning of the Dolac Market, and the reconstruction of the Laščinska road, later Sajmišna, and today the Vjekoslav Heinzel Avenue, a prominent north-south avenue in the eastern part of the city that starts at the Eugen Kvaternik Square and divides Trnje and Peščenica.
During Heinzel's term as mayor, Zagreb got its first 0.35 kW radio transmitter on 15 June 1926. On 1 April the same year, the city installed its first automatic switchboard, with the capacity of 7,000 telephone subscribers.
Heinzel's efforts came at a considerable cost, however, as the city had to take out a loan of 250 million Yugoslav dinars, a topic of much criticism at the time.

<doc id="21356521" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21356521" title="Bert Smyers">
Bert Smyers

Bertrand "Bert" Hunter Smyers (March 1872 – June 18, 1953) was an attorney and, along with fellow student John Scott, founder of the University of Pittsburgh's football program. Smyers is also considered to be the University's first quarterback.
Prep school.
Born in Marion Center, Indiana County, Pennsylvania, Smyers attended Bucknell University when it was a college preparatory school during his senior year of 1888-89. At Bucknell, he had an academic average of 9 out of a scale of 10, considered an outstanding academic achievement, in course that included Natural Philosophy, Rhetoric, Algebra, Caesar, Scriptural History, Composition, Declamation, and Elocution. While there, Smyers was involved in an informal football team, not part of the school's regular sports, which was probably learned from older brothers attending other schools and then taught to pals after school.
University years.
In the fall of 1889, the 130 pound Smyers enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh, then called the Western University of Pennsylvania (WUP), to continue his education. He and senior student John Scott assemble a football team of which only three of the players had previously witnessed the sport. Smyers made himself quarterback and Scott was the center and one informal game was played, a loss to Shadyside Academy in 1889. In preparation for the following season, the first official football season of football recognized by the University of Pittsburgh, Smyers and his teammates took up a collection and purchased a football for practices and games, however players were responsible for their own uniforms and Smyers' own uniform was pieced together by his mother and sister. 
The first official game for the University was held on October 11, 1890 when the Allegheny Athletic Association's opponent, Shadyside Academy, failed to appear for its game at Exposition Park. Allegheny A.A. called Smyers who brought the WUP team as a replacement. WUP was defeated 38-0. Smyers' team next faced Washington & Jefferson College, losing 32-0, but closed out its inaugural three game season with a win over Geneva College 10-4.
The following season saw Smyers suffer a broken nose in a 40-6 losing effort against Washington and Jefferson and the team finished 2-5 with wins over Western Pennsylvania Medical College, which became affiliated with WUP in 1892 and later merged with the University in 1908 to become its medical school, and Geneva College, who WUP lost two other contests to that same season. Perhaps the most important development for the second season of football had been Smyers recruitment of Joeseph Trees from Normal University of Pennsylvania, who at 210 pounds became WUP's first subsidized athlete. Later in life, Trees made millions in the oil industry and became an important benefactor for the University and athletic department. Today, an athletic facility named Trees Hall still bears his name on the University of Pittsburgh's Oakland campus.
In a letter from Harriet Smyers, Bert's daughter-in-law and wife of son William Hays Smyers, to the University of Pittsburgh in 1990, sent in preparation for celebration of 100 years of football there, further details about Bert are given, as follows: Once they were near the goal line and having trouble getting over so (Bert) whispered to his pals just to pick him up bodily and throw him over and he'd hold out the ball. Since he was only about 131 pounds this was easy and they made the touchdown. He told the grandchildren, 'I was Pitt's first forward pass.' The flying wedge as I'm sure you know was outlawed because of the serious injuries that resulted. The team locked arms in form of a wedge and plowed through (or over) the opposing team. At one game only 10 men on the (Pitt) team showed up. The opposing team let them "borrow" another man "elsewhere" and make up the 11. Your guess is as good as mine as to where the extra man came from. (Bert) claimed he was the 2nd strongest man at Pitt. The strongest man could chin himself with ond arm and (Bert) never managed that.
Legacy.
A press release from Pitt, circa 1930, gave the following account of Bert's place in football history: The man who started football at the University of Pittsburgh (at that time, 1889, Western University of Pennsylvania) is still at it. He is Bert Smyers, attorney, member of the Ohio State Game committee, working to enthuse the followers of the Panthers for the trip to Columbus, Nov. 15. Keen of eye and hard of muscle, though somewhat heavier, Pitt's first quarterback is knee deep in the present campaign, as enthused as he was that fall 41 years ago. He's chairman of the sub-committee working with the former varsity men and managers of which association he also is president. Forty one years ago this fall Smyers, a youth weighing 131 pounds, but hard as nails, arrived at the union station from Marion Center, Indiana County. Money wasn't so plentiful with him so he walked from the station to the university. Walking wasn't much of an item to him, anyhow, as he used to drive a herd of cattle from his home town to a neighboring town, walking both ways a total of fourteen miles. And he did that three times a week at $1.25 per trip. It was this walking schedule that made his legs so hard and his wind so good. And it was working about his father's blacksmith shop the other three days that hardened the muscles in his arms and shoulders. Those muscles are still hard. Arriving at the university Bert was the inspiration for a football team, the first on the hill... where now one of the finest stadiums in the country stands and where one of the nation's greatest teams holds forth. "I played four years, as did most of the boys... And the last two years nearly all of us wore beards or moustaches. Football didn't bring in any revenue then. When we started the game we started very modestly. The boys had to supply their own equipment. I had no money to spend recklessly so I wrote home to mother and told her I needed a pair of football pants and she made them by cutting off the legs of an old gray pair and putting rubber elastic around the knees. The stockings were contributed by my sister. The girls wore heavier stockings than they do now. Football players wore jackets and I tried to describe in a letter to my mother that they were made of canvas. But all the canvas they had was some canvas from some old oat sacks around the barn. So she made me a vest of that with laces from an old corset and I was all ready to play! It was a lot of fun even if the game was not so well organized as today. We played the teams of this section, colleges, prep schools, clubs, etc..."
Personal life.
Smyers was married to Flora Bell Hays, on 20 July 1898 at Allegheny. He enjoyed target shooting with his sons. Based on the obituary of son Bertrand Jr., Smyers was also the village blacksmith in Marion Center. Bertrand died on June 18, 1953 at Pittsburgh, and is buried at Marion Center Cemetery. Smyers had 3 sons: Bertrand Jr., William, and Edward.
Bert's daughter-in-law Harriet also recalled in a letter an incident later in Bert's life when he was 60:Once at a Rotary Club picnic they had a contest to see who could climb furthest up the flag pole. The pole was over 100 feet tall and so wide for the first few feet that his arms could not reach around it. He had to grip it with his legs and arms alternately inching up by grasping the pole with his thighs, reaching up with his arms to get a higher hold and holding with his arms while he moved his legs up an inch or two. He stopped at 60 feet and won the contest. He said he could have gone further but since he was 60 years old that year it seemed a good place to stop. He played tennis every Saturday from April to November and once, when in his 60's beat the Pittsburgh High School Tennis champion at an informal set...
A clipping from "The Rotarian" from 1947, six years prior to his death, had the following to say about Bert Smyers: Busy Bert. Although writing doggerel is one of his hobbies, BERT H. SMYERS, a member of the Rotary Club of Pittsburgh, Pa., keeps more active physically than many men half his age. Last August, at age 75, he "caught" a game of soft ball at a Rotary picnic, played three sets of tennis, won a prize in a horse-shoe pitching contest, and won another prize in a waltz contest on the dance floor that evening. He is the only surviving member of the first football team... of the University of Pittsburgh...

<doc id="21356523" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21356523" title="USS Despatch (1873)">
USS Despatch (1873)

The third USS "Despatch" was a United States Navy steamer in commission from 1873-1891.
Acquisition and commissioning.
"Despatch" was the commercial steamer "America" when the U.S. Navy purchased her in November 1873 at New York City. She was commissioned on 23 November 1873, Lieutenant Commander Frederick Rodgers in command.
The "Virginius" Affair, 1873.
Purchased for dispatch duty because of her speed, "Despatch" was assigned to the North Atlantic Station and joined the fleet in December 1873 at Key West, Florida, in anticipation of war with Spain over the seizure of the American filibustering steamer "Virginius" by the Spanish cruiser . The Spanish had taken "Virginius" into port at Santiago de Cuba in Cuba and summarily condemned her, with 53 of her passengers and crew executed (see "Virginius" Affair). After lengthy diplomatic negotiations, 102 survivors were delivered on board , and "Virginius" was ordered to be turned over to Captain W. D. Whiting, Chief of Staff of the North Atlantic Fleet. "Despatch" carried Capt. Whiting to Bahia Honda to take charge of "Virginius", and took "Virginius" in tow for Key West.
"Despatch" remained with the fleet, serving as dispatch vessel and participating in squadron drills until arriving at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., which became her new base on 24 April 1874.
Operations from Washington, D.C., 1874-1877.
From 1874-1877, "Despatch" carried out special duty assignments from her base at Washington, D.C., and at various times operated with the North Atlantic Fleet along the United States East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. She was kept ready for use as a dispatch and relief vessel, and on several occasions transported the Secretary of the Navy and United States Senate committees. She also towed monitors from one point to another and experimented with spar torpedoes at Newport, Rhode Island.
Operations in the Ottoman Empire, 1877-1879.
"Despatch" departed on 20 April 1877 for the eastern Mediterranean and a special assignment with the United States Embassy at Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. Arriving there on 14 June, "Despatch" carried dispatches and transported the American minister to the Ottoman Empire, which was in turmoil because of war with the Russian Empire and internal political unrest. "Despatch" was detached early in 1879, and returned to Washington, D.C., where she was decommissioned on 9 July 1879.
Cadet training, presidential yacht duty, and special assignments, 1880-1891.
After extensive repairs, "Despatch" was recommissioned on 8 June 1880 for use as a training ship and cruised along the U.S. East Coast with cadet engineers from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland on board.
"Despatch" was again out of commission at Washington from 23 September-19 October 1880, then operated principally in the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay and along the U.S. East Coast from Norfolk, Virginia, to Maine until 1891, carrying out special assignments. She was frequently used by the President as the first presidential yacht, as well as by the Secretary of the Navy and other members of the United States Cabinet, Congressional committees, members of naval boards conducting inspections, and for varied ceremonial duties. One of the most important of these ceremonial events occurred on 28 October 1886 when she transported President Grover Cleveland - including his private secretary and three members of his cabinet - to and from Bedloe's Island in New York Harbor for the dedication and unveiling of the Statue of Liberty on 28 October 1886. Over the years, she also carried despatches and men to the fleet and along the U.S. East Coast, towed into port or destroyed damaged ships and wrecks, and escorted new ships during their sea trials. From 12 December 1881-3 June 1882, "Despatch" cruised to Hispaniola to conduct hydrographic surveys of Samana Bay and the Yuna River.
Loss.
After carrying the Secretary of the Navy on a cruise along the New England coast to review the fleet in August 1891, "Despatch" put into New York, from which she sailed for Washington on 9 October 1891. Early on the morning of 10 October, in a gale, she was wrecked on Assateague Island off the Virginia coast. With the aid of men from the Assateague Lifesaving Station of the United States Lifesaving Service, all of "Despatch"s crew got ashore safely.
The wrecked hulk of "Despatch" was sold for salvage on 12 November.

Tärnö

Tärnö is an island in the Blekinge archipelago, the largest and southernmost island in Hällaryd archipelago, in Karlshamn municipality, Blekinge County.
Geography.
The island measures 115.7 ha (285.9 acres) in surface.
The island boasts forty homesteads, now nearly all in use as summer residences.
History.
The island's population was once a farming and fishing community, to which many traces bear witness to this day. Tärnö was an important piloting centre during the first half of the 20th century. During that same period, cobblestones were hewn on the island for shipping to Germany and other countries. The island featured in a number of Per Gunnar Evander's novels.
Communications and Services.
Ferry services to Tärnö are maintained from Karlshamn and from Matvik. Additionally, taxi boats frequent the island. A kiosk is found on the island serving simple food items and other necessities as well as a community centre which is rented out for summer camps and the like. The island's old teachers's residence is also rented out during summer, as are many smaller cottages, both municipally and privately owned.
Sights.
Tärnö has two lighthouses. A large wooden one featuring a drum lens at the island's highest point was built in 1910 to replace a predecessor. The other one is a simple structure for guiding coastal fishery which only has a 40 Watt bulb. A known sight apart from the picturesque cottages and the unique natural surroundings is the "fiskgökaeken" (a hollow centuries-old oak tree), a few Iron Age graves as well as a large naturally formed stone terrace.

Storforsen

Storforsen, a rapid in the Pite River in Swedish Norrbottens län is located approximately 38 km northwest of Älvsbyn. With an average flow of 250 m3/s, the rapids are one of the biggest in Europe. The rapids stretch out over a distance of 5 km in which the riverbed is lowered by 82 metres. 
Flow usually is highest at midsummer: 870 m3/s. During the floodyear 1995 a total of 1200 cubic metres flowed down Storforsen each second. 
To prevent accidents the rocks surrounding the rapids are fenced, views being readily accessible to the public via ramps. While the rapids were used in previous years to transport logs, today its surroundings are part of a nature park, visited by 150,000 people each year.

Masha Kirilenko

Masha Lopatova "Marina" Kirilenko () (born 1979) is a Russian pop singer, wife of Russian basketball player Andrei Kirilenko, and the daughter of the famous CSKA and Russian National Team basketball player Andrei Lopatov.
Lopatova grew up in Moscow and first worked as a model in London. She then owned a sports and entertainment marketing company and managed Russian pop group Boy Band. In 2002, Masha recorded and distributed her own album. The music video for "Sugary", which featured a cameo by Andrei Kirilenko, reached number one on MTV Russia.
The couple moved to Cottonwood Heights, Utah later in 2001 when Andrei, who had been drafted by the NBA's Utah Jazz in 1999, joined the team. They have two sons: Fedya (born 2002) and Stepan (born March 6, 2007). In 2011, Andrei and Masha became American citizens.
Masha Lopatova is an entrepreneur and fashion industry specialist, co-owner of Fashion IQ in Moscow, Russia. Fashion IQ is a fashion consulting and personal styling company that works with the daring and increasingly influential Russian talent in the international arena. Before Masha's move to the fashion industry, however, she had an eclectic and prominent career in the Russian media. 
Although Masha was raised in Moscow, in early adulthood she moved to London to study film. After obtaining a Masters Degree in TV and Video Production from St Martin's College, Masha returned to Moscow to pursue a career specializing in Russian media. During this period Masha launched a PR Firm inspired by her father's athletic career as a well-known and respected basketball player, an agency focused on representing athletes in Russia. It was in this work that she ultimately met and married her husband, NBA basketball player Andrei Kirilenko. 
Shortly after their marriage Andrei's basketball career brought them to the US, where they began their family. After establishing a new home in the US, Masha focused her energy and interest in fashion by opening a small boutique. Shortly after the opening of her American boutique, Fleur De Lis, Masha opened another boutique and showroom, Made In USA, in Moscow, Russia. Combining her expertise in the Russian market and her connections with the American Apparel Industry, Masha began forming distribution partnerships with American Contemporary brands seeking entrance into the Russian market. For seven years she imported diverse labels previously inaccessible to the bold Russian fashionistas. During this time Masha had two boys, Fedor and Stepan, and adopted her daughter, Sasha, from Russia. 
Masha's constant work to promote new brands in the Russian industry eventually brought her full circle to opening Fashion IQ, a PR and consulting company, as well as personal styling agency in Moscow, Russia. Fashion IQ focused heavily on partnerships with highly respected Russian stylists, designers, and became an agency to look to in the Russian fashion business. In 2013 Masha decided to bring Fashion IQ to New York, where she now lives with her family. Offering, this time, a fearless Moscvian perspective of fashion to the US industry. Masha's newest venture, Fashion IQ NYC, will launch in May 2014.
In the USA, Masha and Andrei started a charitable organization, Kirilenko's Kids, to help underprivileged children both locally and in Russia.

H. V. Meyerowitz

Herbert Vladimir Meyerowitz (b. 1900 St. Petersburg, d.1945 London) was an artist, educator and British colonial administrator in Africa.
Meyerowitz's father was a wealthy German businessman and his mother a Russian pianist who had studied with Artur Rubenstein. 
At the time of the 1905 Revolution, the family moved from Russia to Switzerland, where Meyerowitz was educated at a Pestalozzi school. His education was completed in England, with holidays in Russia. The family were in Russia when war broke out in 1914 and, because of their German nationality, they were interned at Ekaterinburg. They moved to Berlin in 1916 as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Germany. In 1918, Meyerowitz served briefly in the German army. 
After the war, he returned to Berlin to study art. Together with his future wife, Eva, he developed an enthusiasm for the art of West Africa. Meyerowitz went on to study woodcarving at the Berlin Kunstgewerbeschule. He became an admirer of the educational theories of Franz Cižek
On the completion of his art training, Meyerowitz moved to South Africa with his wife, where he established a reputation as a wood sculptor. He taught for five years at Cape Town University and opened a school of art.
In 1935, he made a study of the crafts in Lesotho (then Basutoland), which he wrote up in "A Report on the Possibilities of the Development of Village Crafts in Basutoland" (Morija Printing Works, 1936). He organised an exhibition of African Arts and Crafts as part of the International Educational Conference in Salisbury, Rhodesia. He said in a speech that the traditional African art on show was "good, because it still fulfilled its purpose", but that the work brought in from the schools and institutions was "trash ... which we, in the name of education, had inflicted on the people of Africa".
The Rev. H.M.Grace, the Principal of Achimota College in the Gold Coast (Ghana), offered Meyerowitz the job of arts and crafts supervisor. Achimota College had been founded in 1927 as a selective boarding school to train an African élite. It combined Western educational methods with the study of local customs, languages, biology and geography. 
Meyerowitz and his wife made a survey of the indigenous crafts of the Gold Coast, which they found to be in decline. At Achimota, he replaced Western-style art classes based on academic drawing with an arts and crafts approach based on local skills and traditions.
From 1937, Meyerowitz began to develop a scheme for an Institute of West African Arts, Industries and Social Sciences, which would be a "marriage of the of aesthetic skill and power to modern technique". It would investigate local arts and crafts, teach certain native crafts in the light of European experience and create local craft industries. It would also investigate local history, tribal life, customs, religion and economic conditions. This scheme was approved by the West African Governors' Conference at Lagos in 1939 and the Advisory Committee on Education in 1940. Before the war, African colonies had depended on the export of commodities, which was made almost impossible by enemy shipping. The Colonial Office adopted instead a policy developing indigenous industries and eventually accepted Meyerowitz's idea. In 1943, the Institute was set up under the direction of the Rev. R.W.Stopford. Meyerowitz's colleague Michael Cardew records that only the power of Meyerowitz's "magnetic eloquence (backed up by the pressure of the war) could have persuaded the Colonial Office to support the project and the Treasury to release the necessary funds."
Meyerowitz planned the Institute on the basis of production units that would combine the arts with industry. "If industries are to be established for West African needs," he argued, "the only alternative to white capital and coloured labour is a self-contained development of the kind now proposed; and the people as a whole benefit more from many local production units on a co-operative basis than from concentrated industrial centres".
In 1936, on the recommendation of the English studio potter Michael Cardew, Meyerowitz appointed Harry Davis to teach pottery at Achimota and expand the pottery department to manufacture bricks, tiles, water coolers and glazed ware. The College also produced textiles. Davis resigned in 1942, and was replaced by Cardew, who undertook a large expansion of the pottery on a site at Alajo, with the aim of creating a profitable business that would meet all the pottery needs of West Africa, including that of the British Army. The pottery made continuing losses and the educated Africans who worked as apprentices found little to admire in Cardew's studio pottery approach.
Grace had retired from the college in 1940, depriving Meyerowitz of a useful ally. Stopford retired in 1945. The financial losses at the Institute brought its future into question. While in London in 1945, Meyerowitz discovered that his mother, who had remained in Russia, had died in the Siege of Leningrad. He committed suicide in the same year. The inquest recorded that he had suffered from "manic depressive cyclothymia" Shortly after, the Institute was closed.

Industrial spur

An industrial spur is a type of secondary track used by railroads to allow customers a location to load and unload railcars without interfering with other railroad operations.
Background.
Industrial spurs can vary greatly in length and railcar capacity depending on the requirements of the customer the spur is serving. In heavily industrialized areas, it is not uncommon for one industrial spur to have multiple sidings to several different customers. Typically, spurs are serviced by local trains responsible for collecting small numbers of railcars and delivering them to a larger yard, where these railcars are sorted and dispatched in larger trains with other cars destine to similar locations. Because industrial spurs generally have less capacity and traffic than a mainline, they tend to have lower maintenance and signaling (train control) standards.
Today.
Before the rise of the long-distance trucking in the early 1930s, railroads were the primary means of transportation around the world. Industries of the era were commonly built along railroad lines specifically to allow for easy access to shipping. Short (under a mile, oftentimes only several hundred yards) industrial spurs with very small (under ten car) capacities were a common sight along railroads in industrial and rural cities alike. As automobile and roadway technology improved throughout the early and mid 20th century, most low volume industry spurs were abandoned in favor of the greater flexibility and economic savings of trucking. Today, railroads remain the most economical way to ship large quantities of material, a fact that is reflected in industrial spurs. Most modern day spurs serve very large industries that require hundreds, if not thousands, of carloads a year.

Amdo Tibetan

The Amdo language (; also called "Am kä") is the spoken language of the majority of the people of Amdo in northeastern ethno-cultural Tibet, in Chinese provinces of Qinghai and some parts of Sichuan (Aba) and Gansu (Gannan). It is one of the four main spoken languages of Tibetan, the other three being Standard Tibetan ("ü ke") Kham ("kham ke") and Ladakhi ("tö ke"). All four main languages of Tibetan share a common written script but their spoken pronunciations, vocabularies and grammars are different. These differences may have emerged due to geographical isolation of the regions of Tibet. Unlike Khams language and standard Tibetan, Amdo language is not tonal. It retains many word-initial consonant clusters which have been lost in Central Tibetan.

10th Baluch Regiment

The 10th Baluch or Baluch Regiment was a regiment of the British Indian Army from 1922 to 1947. After the independence, it was transferred to the Pakistan Army. In 1956, it was amalgamated with the 8th Punjab and Bahawalpur Regiments. During more than a hundred years of military service, the 10th Baluch Regiment acquired an enviable reputation as one of the most distinguished among the fabled regiments of the British Indian Army. Its long list of honours and awards includes four Victoria Crosses.
The Bombay Army.
The Baluch Regiment originated in the Army of Bombay Presidency in 1844, when Sir Charles Napier raised the 1st Belooch (old spelling of Baluch) Battalion (raised as the Scinde Beloochee Corps and designated as 27th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in 1861) for local service in the newly conquered province of Sindh. Two years later, another Belooch battalion was raised (designated as the 29th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry in 1861), while in 1858, John Jacob raised Jacob's Rifles (30th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry), which would soon become the 3rd Belooch Regiment. The term 'local' was interpreted fairly loosely when it became necessary to send the 2nd Beloochees to the Persian War in 1856-57, a campaign frequently overshadowed by the events of the Indian Mutiny in 1857. The 1st was in Karachi when the news of the insurrection reached the Commissioner. Sir Bartle Frere dispatched them with all haste, on foot across the Sindh desert in May, to join the siege artillery train on its way to Delhi; the only Bombay unit to join the Delhi Field Force. The regiment was brought into line for its services in North India as the 27th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. Meanwhile, the 2nd Beloochees were also regularized as the 29th Regiment. In 1862, the 2nd Beloochees were dispatched to China to suppress the Taiping Rebellion. Two years later, they became the first foreign troops to be stationed in Japan, when two companies were sent to Yokohama to guard the British legation. The 1st Beloochees greatly distinguished themselves in the tough Abyssinian Campaign of 1868 and were made Light Infantry as a reward. All Baloch battalions took part in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, where the Jacob's Rifles suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Maiwand. The 1st Belooch Regiment again distinguished itself in 1885-87 during the Third Burma War.
In 1891, two battalions of Bombay Infantry also became "Baluchi," when they were reconstituted with Baluchis, Hazaras and Pathans from Baluchistan and localized in the province. The first of these, the 24th (Baluchistan) Infantry was raised in 1820, while the other, 26th (Baluchistan) Infantry was raised in 1825. Following the Kitchener Reforms of 1903, these battalions were redesignated as the 124th Duchess of Connaught's Own Baluchistan Infantry, 126th Baluchistan Infantry, 127th Queen Mary's Own Baluch Light Infantry, 129th Duke of Connaught's Own Baluchis and 130th King George's Own Baluchis (Jacob's Rifles). In 1914, their full dress uniforms included red trousers worn with rifle green or drab tunics.
First World War.
During the First World War, most of the regiments raised second battalions, while the 124th Baluchistan Infantry raised two battalions. Only 2/124th Baluchistan Infantry of the wartime raisings was retained after the post-war reforms.
The 129th DCO Baluchis served on the Western Front in France and Belgium, where they became the first Indian regiment to attack the Germans and the only Indian regiment to fight in both the First & Second Battles of Ypres. At Hollebeke, during the First Ypres, Sepoy Khudadad Khan became the first Indian to win the Victoria Cross; Britain's highest decoration for valour. Prior to 1911 Indian soldiers had not been eligible for the Victoria Cross. The battalion would go on to serve with distinction in German East Africa alongside the 127th QMO Baluch Light Infantry and 130th KGO Baluchis. Meanwhile, the 1st and 3rd Battalions of 124th DCO Baluchistan Infantry served in Persia, while the 2nd distinguished itself in Mesopotamia and Palestine.
Inter-War Period.
After the First World War, a major re-organization of British Indian Army took place. Most of the wartime units were disbanded, while the remaining single-battalion regiments were merged to form large regimental groups of 4-6 battalions each. Among these was the 10th Baluch Regiment, formed in 1922 at Rajkot (Rajasthan) from the five old Baluch battalions and the second battalion of 124th Baluchistan Infantry. The regimental depot later shifted to Karachi. The distinctive rifle green and red uniform of the old Baluch battalions was adopted by the entire regiment. The officers wore a cherry boss surmounted by a silver 'X' on field and forage caps, while the old battalion badges continued to be worn on pagris and helmets by the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th Battalions. It was not until 1945 that a single cap badge was adopted by the regiment on introduction of berets during the Second World War. It consisted of a Roman numeral 'X' within a crescent moon, a crown above and title scroll below, all in white metal. The badges of rank were in black metal with red edging, while the lanyard was of rifle green cord with two red runners. Another distinctive feature of Baluchi uniforms were plain silver ball buttons worn on service and mess dresses.
The line up of the new regiment was:
Second World War.
The regiment's record of service in the war was once again most impressive. It suffered 6572 casualties and won numerous gallantry awards including two Victoria Crosses to Naik Fazal Din and Sepoy Bhandari Ram. During the Second World War, the regiment raised another ten battalions, although most of them were disbanded after the war. At the end of 1945, the 10th Baluch Regiment lost its number and became The Baluch Regiment.
Post-independence.
At the time of independence, the active battalions were 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th & 17th. The regiment was allotted to Pakistan. Dogra companies of the Baluch Regiment were transferred to the Indian Army. The Regimental Centre shifted to Quetta in 1947 to make room for the Government offices in the new capital of Pakistan. In 1948, the 6th and 8th Battalions were re-raised in response to the war with India in Kashmir, where the 4th Battalion greatly distinguished itself in the Battle of Pandu. In 1956, major reorganization took place in the Pakistan Army and larger infantry groups were created by amalgamating the existing infantry regiments. As a result, the 8th Punjab and Bahawalpur Regiments were absorbed by the Baluch Regiment (now called the Baloch Regiment). The new line up of the regiment was:

Willershausen is a village and castle in the Gemeinde of Herleshausen in Werra-Meißner-Kreis, Hesse.
In 1383, the Treusch von Buttlar were lords of Willershausen and adjacent areas. Already at the end of the 13th Century, the residential tower and the defensive tower of the present castle were built. The Treusch von Buttlar were the owner until the 1757. The castle came to the von Kutzleben family and the Schwebheim branch of the von Bibra family in 1757. The estate was divided between the two families on September 27, 1817. Ernst von Bibra sold their portion in 1850 to Landgrave Carl August of Hesse. From 1889 to 1992 the Landgraves of Hesse were owner of the property. Today, a golf course is maintained.

Built in the 1930s as the town expanded eastwards, Woodhall was a thriving community centred on Woodhall Square and the adjoining Woodhall Terrace at the foot of the hill. Mansion Avenue and Heggies Avenue climb up the steep hill to opposite ends of Parkhill Avenue, whilst Brightside, Pleasantside and Sunnyside Avenues (plus a branch of Mansion Avenue) follow the contours of the hill and are therefore reasonably flat.
Woodhall Terrace consisted of fine red sandstone tenements along the south side of the A8 Glasgow Road. Woodhall Square was a major bus terminus, with a service every ten minutes to Gourock at peak times and hourly "through" services to Glasgow and Largs. Dino's Italian Cafe and shop stood in the square and was popular with day-trippers heading for the bus to Gourock or those going by foot to picnic at nearby Parklea on the banks of the Clyde.
There was a busy Co-op grocery shop on Brightside Avenue at the junction with Mansion Avenue, one of several local Co-op shops in Port Glasgow. Further up the hill, Parkhill Square was also a bus terminus until the late 1960s at which time the buses started to run on up the hill to Oronsay Avenue in Park Farm and Bardrainney.
Industry.
There was no industry in the area until a small industrial estate named Kelburn Business Park opened in the 1980s, alongside the realigned A8 dual carriageway. Two of the three units are occupied by Vango and White House Products Ltd, the third unit was vacated by Chinese company Amphenol in 2001.
The adjacent Woodhall Park, which was home to Port Glasgow F.C., better known as The Port Juniors, was cleared and zoned for industrial use by Inverclyde Council in 2000 - the land remains derelict at the time of writing in 2009.
2009.
All but one of the tenements on Woodhall Terrace were demolished in 2002, along with many of the houses on "the avenues" and all of the houses on and to the east of Parkhill Square, leaving the area with a forlorn, ghost-town look today. Dino has long gone, but the building survives and is occupied by a Post Office and licenced grocer. The Co-op building on Brightside has become Riverview Resource Centre. St Martin's Church and hall are still there, behind a stockade-like fence. Further along Mansion Avenue is Tree Tops Nursery, standing alone on a street where the houses have all been demolished.
The future.
Plans by River Clyde Homes to build new houses on Parkhill Avenue were reported by local newspaper The Greenock Telegraph on 29 January 2009.
Public transport.
The area is served by Woodhall railway station on the Inverclyde Line which has regular services to and from Glasgow Central and Gourock. Local buses run from Greenock town centre to Oronsay Avenue via Heggies Avenue every twenty minutes at peak times.

Clothing in ancient Greece

Clothing in ancient Greece primarily consisted of the chiton, peplos, himation, and chlamys. While no clothes have survived from this period, descriptions exist in contemporary accounts and artistic depictions. Clothes were mainly homemade, and often served many purposes (such as bedding). Despite popular imagination and media depictions of all-white clothing, elaborate design and bright colors were favored.
History and types.
Ancient Greek clothing consisted of lengths of linen or wool fabric, which generally was rectangular. 
Clothes were secured with ornamental clasps or pins (, "perónē"; cf. fibula), and a belt, sash, or girdle (zone) might secure the waist.
Men's robes went down to their knees, whereas women's went down to their ankles.
The inner tunic was a peplos or chiton. The peplos was a dress worn by women. It was usually a lighter woollen garment, more distinctively Greek, with its shoulder clasps. The upper part of the peplos was folded down to the waist to form an apoptygma. The chiton was a simple tunic garment of lighter linen, worn by both genders and all ages. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. Often the chiton is shown as pleated. Either garment could be pulled up under the belt to blouse the fabric: kolpos.
A strophion was an undergarment sometimes worn by women around the mid-portion of the body, and a shawl (epiblema) could be draped over the tunic.
Women dressed similarly in most areas of ancient Greece although in some regions, they also wore a loose veil as well at public events and market.
The chlamys was made from a seamless rectangle of woolen material worn by men as a cloak. It was about the size of a blanket, usually bordered. The chlamys was typical Greek military attire from the 5th to the 3rd century BC. It was worn also to symbol that is is a soldier.
The basic outer garment during winter was the himation, a larger cloak worn over the peplos or chlamys. The himation has been most influential perhaps on later fashion.
During Classical times in Greece, male nudity received a religious sanction following profound changes in the culture. After that time, male athletes participated in ritualized athletic competitions such as the classical version of the ancient Olympic Games, in the nude as women became barred from the competition except as the owners of racing chariots. Their ancient events were discontinued, one of which (a footrace for women) had been the sole original competition. Myths relate that after this prohibition, a woman was discovered to have won the competition while wearing the clothing of a man—instituting the policy of nudity among the competitors that prevented such embarrassment again.

R.O.C. (band)

R.O.C. are a British electronica group, founded in 1983 by Fred Browning and Patrick Nicholson in London, England. Karen Sheridan joined the band in 1993.
Career.
Their early singles displayed a tendency to black humour, but with their first album, "ROC", the group revealed a more personal side. Fred Browning (sometimes written as Fred Braunen) and Karen Sheridan supplied the songwriting.
The Virgin album featured "Dada", based around Idi Amin's laugh, and "Said What I Said". Regarding "Ocean & England", "Q" said: "it ends with a love song - now that is unsettling".
Virgin dropped ROC in 1999, and the band seemed finished. ROC continued with three single releases, including "2000Mann" on the Spiky record label, and toured the UK with Sneaker Pimps. The threesome reconvened in 2003, joining the Brooklyn-based label 12 Apostles. In 2004, they were back in the recording studio with long-standing collaborators Danton Supple and Gareth Huw Davies. "Night Fold Around Me" was completed in early 2005.
A single, "Princess", was BBC 6 Music's 'Evening Single of the Week' in July 2005. The follow-up "Journey to the Centre of Brixton" made Playlouder.com's readers' poll best singles of 2005 (despite only being released in December), with radio airplay including BBC Radio 1 and 6 Music (UK) and 2SER (Australia). 
In June 2006, "Night Fold Around Me" was released.

The Church of Scientology (Melton)

The Church of Scientology is a book written by J. Gordon Melton on the Church of Scientology. It is the first of a series of books on new religious movements published by the Center for Studies on New Religions.
Contents.
The book deals with the history and development of Scientology, covering such matters as church's structure and organization, ethics, and nonprofit initiatives. It also deals with the church's views regarding religious freedom and human rights, as well as its members efforts to win their own religious freedom and human rights. It also deals with the question the Church itself has often been asked, whether it does qualify as a religion.
Reception.
The book was well-received on publication. Derek Davis in the "Journal of Church and State" said "Few books pack as much information into so little space." Catherine Ritchie in "Library Journal" called it a brief, well-balanced guide to the controversial movement, and a good choice for public libraries. Jana Riess in "Publishers Weekly" said it was a rare, welcome impartial treatment of the subject by an outsider and that it did an admirable job covering the bases and showing the views of both the Church and its detractors.
After publication, many sources cast doubt on the book's impartiality. This was partly due to the fact that the book uses few references other than those provided by the church and therefore contains very little negative information about the organization, even though there are many critics who deem Scientology dangerous and a cult that does much harm.

Maryland Route 381

Maryland Route 381 (MD 381) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Brandywine Road, the highway runs from MD 231 at Patuxent north to U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in Brandywine. MD 381 connects Brandywine with the southeastern corner of Prince George's County and the northeastern corner of Charles County. The highway was constructed from MD 5 through Brandywine in the 1910s. MD 381 was extended southeast to MD 231 in the late 1920s and early 1930s. When MD 5 was relocated between Camp Springs and Brandywine in the mid-1950s, MD 381 was extended north along the old road to Camp Springs. The highway was rolled back to its present terminus at US 301 in the mid-1960s.
Route description.
MD 381 begins at an intersection with MD 231 (Prince Frederick Road) at the hamlet of Patuxent between Hughesville and the Patuxent River. The highway heads north as a two-lane road to the Charles–Prince George's county line at Swanson Creek. Just north of Swanson Creek, MD 381 crosses the Herbert Subdivision of CSX's Pope's Creek Subdivision, which connects the Pope's Creek Subdivision with the Chalk Point Generating Station to the east. Road access to the power plant is provided by Eagle Harbor Road, which also serves the tiny town of Eagle Harbor. MD 381 continues through the village of Aquasco, which contains the historic homes Sunnyside and Villa DeSales and St. Mary's Rectory. The highway gradually curves northwest and meets MD 382 (Croom Road) at Poplar Hill. MD 381 passes through the village of Baden, which contains St. Paul's Parish Church, and to the east of Cedarville, which sits north of Cedarville State Forest.
MD 381 completes its westward curve before entering the village of Brandywine. MD 381 has a pair of at-grade railroad crosses at two of the three corners of the wye junction of the Herbert Subdivision and the Pope's Creek Subdivision. West of the latter railroad, the highway passes the historic William W. Early House. MD 381 veers northwest just before reaching its northern terminus at US 301 (Robert Crain Highway) adjacent to Gwynn Park High School and northeast of US 301's partial interchange with MD 5 (Branch Avenue). Brandywine Road continues as a county highway northwest through the hamlet of T.B., where the highway meets the eastern end of MD 373 (Accokeek Road), the northern end of short, unsigned MD 631 (Old Brandywine Road), and intersects MD 5. Brandywine Road serves the missing movements of the US 301–MD 5 interchange, allowing access from southbound MD 5 to northbound US 301 and from southbound US 301 to northbound MD 5.
History.
The first section of Brandywine Road to be improved was from the Pope's Creek Branch railroad crossing east to North Keys Road, which was built by Prince George's County with state aid as a gravel road in 1911. By 1921, a segment of gravel road connected the Brandywine section with the Southern Maryland Road in the hamlet of T.B. at what is today the intersection of Brandywine Road and Old Brandywine Road east of MD 5. Construction on the remainder of MD 381 began in 1929 with the construction of three sections of gravel road between Brandywine to Aquasco. All three segments were completed by the end of 1930. MD 381 was completed as a gravel road from Aquasco to its southern terminus at Patuxent in 1933. When MD 5 was relocated to its present alignment from its junction with US 301 north to north of Camp Springs in 1956, MD 381 was extended north along MD 5's old alignment on Brandywine Road and Old Branch Avenue through Clinton and Camp Springs. The portion of the state highway north of US 301 was transferred to county maintenance in 1965.

Plot.
Saki Miyanaga, a high school first-year student, does not like mahjong because her family would always force her to play it and punish her regardless of the outcome of the game. Due to this, she learned how to keep her score at zero, neither winning nor losing, a skill said to be more difficult than actually consistently winning. However, her friend from middle school, completely unaware of such circumstances, convinces her to visit the school's small mahjong club upon entering into high school. After the club discovers her ability, they recruit her permanently and convince her to win instead of breaking even.

Joseph I (Chaldean Patriarch)

Mar Yousip I (Joseph I, † 1707) was the first incumbent of the "Josephite" line of Church of the East, thus being considered the Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church from 1681 to 1696.
Background situation.
By 1660, the Church of the East had become divided into two patriarchates:
Life.
Although the town of Amid in 1553 has been the See of Yohanan Shimun VIII Sulaqa, the area of influence of the "Shimun" patriarchs moved soon towards East, and by 1660 the area of Amid was under the Alqosh's patriarchate. In 1667 the Capuchin missionary Jean-Baptiste de St-Aignan established there, teaching to omit the liturgical commemoration of Nestorius and to use the title Mother of God for Saint Mary.
Yousip (Joseph) was born in Amid and educated by the priest 'Abd Al-Ahad. He was consecrated metropolitan bishop of Amid between 1669 and 1672, and shortly after in 1672 became catholic. The reaction of Alqosh's patriarch Eliya X (XI) Yukhannan Maraugin was very strong: he came personally to Amid, installed a traditionalist bishop named David and had Joseph to be twice imprisoned. Joseph was released only after a payment of a ransom and had to leave to Rome. When Joseph returned in 1677, the bishop David fled in Egypt and the Ottoman authorities recognized Joseph's independence and his government over the dioceses of Amid and Mardin.
On June 23, 1681 arrived the formal recognition from Rome with the delivery of the pallium and the granting of the title ""Patriarch of the Chaldean nation deprived of its patriarch"". Thus into the Church of the East began a new patriarchal line in Full Communion with Rome.
Felt ill, in August 1694 Joseph I left Amid for Rome, and formally abdicated in 1696. He died in Rome on Nov. 10, 1707.
The life of Mar Yousip I is mainly known by his biography written in the early 18th century by 'Adb Al-Ahad son of Garabet (bishop of Amid, died 1728) and later translated in French in 1898 by J.P. Chabot.

Water supply and sanitation in Egypt

"This article covers drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt. For questions related to the water balance, water pollution, irrigation, flood control or trans-boundary water issues please see Water resources management in modern Egypt. 
"This article was last substantially updated in October 2012."
Drinking water supply and sanitation in Egypt is characterized by both achievements and challenges. Among the achievements are an increase of piped water supply between 1990 and 2010 from 89% to 100% in urban areas and from 39% to 93% in rural areas despite rapid population growth; the elimination of open defecation in rural areas during the same period; and in general a relatively high level of investment in infrastructure. Access to an improved water source in Egypt is now practically universal with a rate of 99%. On the institutional side, the regulation and service provision have been separated to some extent through the creation of a national Holding Company for Water and Wastewater in 2004, and of an economic regulator, the Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency (EWRA), in 2006.
However, many challenges remain. Only about one half of the population is connected to sanitary sewers. Partly because of low sanitation coverage about 17,000 children die each year because of diarrhea. Another challenge is low cost recovery due to water tariffs that are among the lowest in the world. This in turn requires government subsidies even for operating costs, a situation that has been aggravated by salary increases without tariff increases after the Arab Spring. Poor operation of facilities, such as water and wastewater treatment plants, as well as limited government accountability and transparency, are also issues.
Foreign aid from the United States, the European Union, France, Germany, the World Bank and other donors remains important, both in terms of financing and in terms of technical assistance. Western donors also have long promoted sector reforms aiming at higher levels of cost recovery and more efficient service provision. Private sector participation has so far been limited mainly to Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects for treatment plants.
Access.
There are conflicting figures about the number of people with access to safe water, and especially the number of people with access to sanitation. According to the official UN figures used to monitor the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, 99% of Egyptians had access to an improved water source and 94% had access to improved sanitation in 2008.
According to one source, Egypt has reached the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people without proper access to safe water and sanitation by 2015 ahead of time in 2008. However, according to the government report of the same year, Egypt was still off track to achieve the sanitation target in rural areas, especially in Upper Egypt and in frontier governorates. 
Soakaway latrines, which are common in rural areas, often do not work properly due to the high groundwater table, infrequent emptying and cracks in the walls. Thus sewage leaks out and contaminates the surrounding streets, canals, and groundwater. Trucks that empty latrines and septic tanks do not necessarily discharge septage into wastewater treatment plants, but rather dump the content in the environment.
Service quality.
Continuity of supply.
According to the government's National Research Center, 40 percent of Cairo's inhabitants do not get water for more than three hours per day and three large districts do not receive any piped water. In 2008 demonstrations concerning this issue took place in Suez, where 500 people blocked a main road to Cairo. According to a survey carried out prior to 2006 in governorate of Fayoum, 46% of households complained about low water pressure, 30% about frequent water cuts and 22% complained that water is not available during day time. These problems lead many people to use water from canals which could be hazardous to health. Service quality is particularly poor in mature informal districts where about 20% of the Egyptian population lives.
Drinking water quality.
It is estimated that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. One reason is that drinking water quality is often below standards. Some water treatment plants are not maintained properly and are thus inefficient in removing parasites, viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. In 2009, a study by the Ministry of Health showed that drinking water for half a million people in Asiut was unfit for human consumption. As of June 2011, nothing had been done to address the problem. Chlorination systems of wells, which had been installed years ago because high levels of bacteria had been detected in the groundwater, failed for lack of maintenance and have been shut down so that untreated water is provided to the residents. 
In the village Wardan in North Giza, the water became very dark in 2007. The authorities declared that they were not responsible, claiming that illegal shallow wells or boosters that some residents installed to ensure water availability and pressure, are responsible for the problem. According to the Ministry of Environment, "there is a lack of coordination among institutions responsible for monitoring water quality and an absence of a unified system of analysis, techniques and methodologies".
Wastewater treatment.
Egypt had 372 municipal wastewater treatment plants in 2012, treating an average of 10.1 million cubic meters per day. The capacity of Egypt's wastewater treatment plants was more than 11 million cubic meters per day, serving more than 18 million people. The number has increased 10 times between 1985 and 2005. The amount of water which is released into the Nile is 3.8 billion m³ per year, out of which only 35% was treated properly as of 2004.
The largest wastewater treatment plant in Egypt is located in Gabal el Asfar to the Northeast of Cairo, serving about 9 million people and treating 2 million cubic meters per day in 2009. The plant discharges into the Belbeis Drain and then into Bahr El Baqar Drain (BBD), which in turn drains to Lake Manzala 170 km away from Cairo. The drain and Lake Manzala had been identified as "black spots" by the Egyptian Environmental Action Plan back in 1992. The quality of water improved substantially after the completion of the first 1.2 million cubic meter per day stage of the plant in 1999, but the drain and the lake are still environmentally fragile. Until 2009 the capacity was extended to 2 million cubic meters per day. A contract for the expansion of the plant to 2.5 million cubic meters per day is financed by the African Development Bank. The tendering began in 2011 and the Design-Build-Operate contract was awarded in October 2013. Completion is expected in 2015. A planned third stage would bring capacity to 3 million cubic meters per day, serving 12 million people and making Gabal al Asfar one of the largest wastewater treatment plants in the world. 
Another large wastewater treatment plant is located at Abu Rawash in the western part of Giza governorate. It initially treated 0.4 million cubic meters only at primary level. The treated water is discharged in the Barakat drain and then 50 km downstream into the Nile River. In 2005-08 the capacity was increased to 1.2 million cubic meters per day. In 2013 a tender was underway to upgrade the entire plant to secondary treatment and to increase its capacity to 1.6 million cubic meters per day with a possible loan funding from EBRD and Egyptian banks as part of a public-private partnership.
Water resources.
Egypt’s main source of freshwater is the Nile River. The river supplies 56.8 billion m³ of freshwater every year, which represents 97% of all renewable water resources in Egypt. Average rainfall in Egypt is estimated at 18 mm or 1.8 billion m³ per year. Furthermore, Egypt has four different groundwater aquifers: the Nile Aquifer, the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer, the Moghra Aquifer and the Coastal Aquifer.
Since 2005, Egypt is classified as a water scarce country as it has less than 1000 m³ of fresh water per year per capita. Furthermore, it is forecasted that in 2025 the population will reach 95 million, which would mean a per capita share of only 600 m³ per year.
Water use and hygiene behavior.
At the national level, total domestic water use in Egypt is estimated at about 5.5 billion m³ per year or 8% of total water use. This corresponds to an average of about 200 liter per capita per day (l/c/d), or almost twice as much as in Germany. However, actual domestic water use is lower because of network losses, and furthermore it varies considerably between different localities in Egypt. For example, the installed drinking water supply capacity ranges from 70 l/c/d in Upper Egypt to 330 l/c/d in Cairo. Water consumption in Alexandria is about 300 l/c/d.
At the local level, a study on water and sanitation in two villages in the Nile Delta conducted in the late 1980s provides some insights into water use and hygiene behavior in rural areas at the time. The inhabitants had access to three water sources: piped water from household connections or public standpipes; shallow wells with handpumps; and canal water. Canals were used by many women for laundry and washing domestic utensils, and for cleaning vegetables and grain.
Women preferred canal water to groundwater because canal water was softer and was not brackish. The surroundings of standpipes were dirty and the residents did not feel responsible to maintain them, seeing this as a responsibility of the government. Shallow wells were contaminated. There was no sewerage and no system to dispose greywater. Household latrines were used primarily by women. Men used sanitary facilities at mosques or defecated in canals. Children defecated openly in the streets or fields. Emptying of latrines was done by donkey carts or trucks which empty their load into canals. As a result of conditions like these infant mortality remained high despite the government's provision of water through standpipes. 
More recent survey data show that hygiene behavior has improved since then at the national level: The rate of open defecation in rural areas declined from 17% in 1990 to less than 1% in 2005. While provision of water supply alone had only a limited impact on child mortality, subsequent improvements in sanitation and hygiene behavior contributed to significantly reduce child mortality from 90/1000 births in 1990 to 23 in 2008.
Infrastructure.
As of 2008, there were 153 large and 817 small drinking water treatment plants, as well as 239 wastewater treatment plants. The length of the water distribution networks was 107,000 km and the length of the wastewater collection network was 29,000 km.
History.
From the 19th century to contemporary Egypt.
The first modern water companies in Egypt were created by European private investors in Alexandria and Cairo in the 1860s under the Khedivate of Egypt. At the same time, the French-British Suez Canal Company operated, alongside the Suez Canal itself, the drinking water supply for the Suez Canal cities Port Said, Suez and Ismailia, the latter city having been created by the company.
The Cairo and Alexandria water companies were nationalized in 1956, along with the nationalization of the Suez Canal by the socialist government of Gamal Abdel Nasser. For the promotion of investments in provincial cities, two state agencies were created, one in charge of water supply and one in charge of sanitation.
Economic opening and the arrival of foreign aid in the 1970s.
With the economic opening of Egypt under the government of Anwar Sadat in the 1970s (Infitah) substantial foreign aid arrived. In particular, USAID provided assistance for water supply and sanitation in Greater Cairo, Alexandria and the Suez Canal cities. Provincial cities and rural areas, however, were initially neglected. About half of the investments undertaken at that time were made in Cairo and Alexandria, although only a quarter of the population lived there.
Achievements. As a result of massive externally funded investments access to water supply and sanitation increased substantially during the next decades. For example, water production capacity increased from 5.5 million cubic meters per day in 1982 to 21 million in 2004 and per capita water consumption increased from 130 to 275 liter per day during the same period.
Challenges. However, the organizations in charge of operating and maintaining the infrastructure were weak in terms of financial and human resources, especially in provincial Egypt, so that service quality remained poor. A World Bank sector study in the late 1970s observed “dismal conditions”, such as 
Concerning inadequate cost recovery, in provincial Egypt only about one-third of the operating cost was recovered. Rural water supply was mostly through standpipes that provided water for free. All the meagre revenues were transferred to the Central Government, which in turn provided subsidies that were insufficient for proper operation and maintenance.
Only one of the six problems diagnosed in the 1970s has been resolved: investment levels have substantially increased and have remained high. However, the other problems still largely prevail more than three decades later despite two sector reforms carried out in 1981 and 2004.
Sector fragmentation and its consequences. The structure of the drinking water supply sector in the mid-1970s illustrates the problem of fragmentation:
The responsibility for wastewater collection and disposal systems was almost equally fragmented. It consisted of:
The planning of infrastructure for water supply and sanitation was separated between two organizations, GOPW and GOSSD. As a result, some towns or neighborhoods received access to piped water supply, but not to sewers, which led to a deterioration of the hygiene situation.
The 1981 reforms: Reduced fragmentation and creation of public companies.
To remedy this situation, donors pushed for a sector reform. In order to promote the reforms they also proposed to finance two projects in the Nile Delta, one in Beheira Governorate financed by the World Bank and one in Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate financed by Germany.
The government initiated the reform in 1981 with two key elements: First, it merged the water and sanitation investment agencies GOPW and GOSSD in a single new entity called NOPWASD. Second, it promoted the creation of autonomous water and wastewater companies in each governorate, following the example of the existing companies in Cairo and Alexandria. However, the central government did not push hard for their creation. Two decades later only three such companies were created. 
The Water Companies in the Nile Delta. The governor of Beheira governorate, located next to Alexandria, created the first such company, the Beheira Water Company, by decree in 1981. With financing from the World Bank and France, facilities in the governorate were renovated and expanded. This led to some positive results: water supply became continuous and cost recovery for operating costs was achieved. However, the project took 13 years to complete, 7 years longer than expected and experienced 67 percent cost overruns.
Two more water companies were created in the late 1980s, both also in the Nile Delta governorates and under the influence of external financiers: the Damietta water company with support from the World Bank and the Kafr el-Sheikh water and wastewater company with support from Germany. In other governorates, such as in Daqahliya, resistance from the governors and from NOPWASD prevented the creation of a water company despite pressure by external donors.
The three water companies were less successful than expected. A 1991 USAID report concluded:
Public Economic Authorities in other governorates. Seven other governorates (Aswan Governorate, Minya Governorate, Beni Suef Governorate, Faiyum Governorate, Dakahlia Governorate, Gharbia Governorate and Sharqia Governorate) created Public Economic Authorities for water supply which took over the responsibility to operate water supply systems from the former regional systems that had been operated by GOPW. These units had less scope for financial and managerial autonomy than the water companies.
National Water Pricing Policy. In 1985 the government adopted a National Water Pricing Policy with the objective to gradually reach full operation and maintenance cost recovery for water by 1991. The policy also introduced a sewer surcharge set at just 10% of the water bill. The policy also provided for incentives (10 percent of total income) in the form of bonuses to workers in the water industry. However, tariffs were not increased as foreseen by the policy.
Remaining challenges. In 2000, almost 10 years later, things had not much changed. A report by NOPWASD stated that institutional capacity and cost recovery in the sector remained low. Infrastructure continued to fall into disrepair, while the entities in charge of water supply and sewerage systems ran large deficits that were only partly covered through subsidies. At that time, the Alexandria Water Company was the only water company in Egypt to cover its operating costs. The report concluded that there was a “duplication of administrative entities, low cost recovery ratios, and lack of qualified management and modern management systems”. 
A few years later, another government report observed that water and wastewater service providers were overstaffed with poorly qualified and poorly paid employees, that there was no system to evaluate staff performance, that billing and collection were poor and done manually, that there was no system to respond to citizen complaints, and no procedures for maintenance.
The 2004 reforms: Creation of the Holding Company and private sector participation.
Genesis of the reforms. When donors expressed their dissatisfaction with the poor performance of the sector, the government initiated another sector reform that, again, aimed at improving service quality, gradually attaining a financial equilibrium and improving staff skills. The Ministry of Housing charged NOPWASD with the elaboration of a diagnostic study and recommendations for reforms. This was to be done under the label of decentralization through the creation of commercially oriented companies at the governorate level, just as recommended two decades earlier. However, two new elements were added to the reforms: private sector participation and autonomous regulation.
The study was presented to the Cabinet of Ministers in 1998. The Cabinet charged the Ministry of Housing with the elaboration of two documents: a decree on the reorganization of the water and wastewater sector, as well as a law on public utility concessions for water and wastewater. Both were initially approved in principle by Cabinet in 2000. However, the water concession law was never passed. A decree for the creation of a regulatory agency was also circulated. The process of enacting the reforms took many more years. During this time the decree on the reorganization of the sector was modified, creating a Holding Company that would de facto compete with NOPWASD.
Creation of the Holding Company. In April 2004 the decree that created the Holding Company, which was to become a central institution of the sector, was enacted. The existing 7 water and wastewater companies (2 in Cairo, 2 in Alexandria, and the 3 in the Nile Delta) as well as the existing 7 Public Economic Authorities were all transformed into affiliated companies of the Holding Company. While the Holding Company did not become responsible for investment, it was responsible for the acquisition of equipment to modernize its affiliate companies and for training their staff. Also, it became a key interlocutor for foreign donors.
Creation of a regulatory agency. In 2006 the sector reforms were complemented by the creation of a regulatory agency, the Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency. The creation of an “autonomous” regulatory agency for utilities was a standard recommendation made by donors for infrastructure sector reforms in developing countries at that time. The agency's tasks include reviewing proposals for tariff adjustments, monitoring the application of technical standards and reviewing customer complaints. The agency also has a mandate to both promote and regulate private sector participation. These tasks overlap with the tasks of other agencies, such as the Holding Company (which also reviews proposals for tariff adjustments, alongside the Ministry of Housing and the Cabinet), the public companies (which also review complaints) and the PPP Central Unit (which also promotes private sector participation). Five years after its creation, the regulatory agency remains a relatively weak and marginal entity whose autonomy is doubtful.
Private sector participation. In 2006 the government created a Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) Central Unit in the Ministry of Finance to promote private greenfield investments in infrastructure across various sectors. In the water sector, the unit promoted large Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects for new wastewater treatment plants in Cairo and Alexandria. The unit left the operation of the utilities untouched.
Implementing the reforms. With the passing of the reforms, tariffs in Greater Cairo were increased from an extremely low base level by 100% as a signal to donors that the reforms were serious. The Holding Company started a program to replace 800,000 non-functioning meters, created a central laboratory, procured SCADA and GIS systems for the public companies and established customer hotlines. Furthermore, the Holding Company established a performance benchmarking system including bonus payments that are paid to companies that improve their performance. As a result of the reforms, donors re-engaged in the sector.
Unresolved challenges. While the reforms addressed some issues, others remain unresolved. For example, sector fragmentation was not actually reduced. No organization was dissolved; instead several new organizations were created. Cost recovery is still very low; overstaffing has apparently even increased from about 6.5 employees per 1000 connections in the early 2000s to about 10 in 2008. Also, the separation of responsibilities for investment and operation in provincial Egypt has not been addressed: NOPWASD remains in charge of investment, while the Affiliated Companies are only in charge of operation.
Overcoming the separation of investment and operation?. In the absence of a comprehensive reform, European donors have begun to address this issue at the project level. Under the Improved Water and Sanitation Program (IWSP), approved in 2009, the water and sanitation companies will be responsible for carrying out investments, thus by-passing NOPWASD. IWSP is jointly funded by four European financiers and the Egyptian government with a volume of 295 million Euro for its first phase. However, the World Bank under its Integrated Sanitation and Sewerage Infrastructure Project approved in 2008 (USD 320m in two phases) continues to channel investments through NOPWASD.
Impact of the Arab Spring (2011 onwards).
The Arab spring temporarily diverted policy attention away from sector reforms, while the financial situation of the Egyptian water utilities deteriorated because of wage increases that were not fully compensated through higher subsidies. Furthermore, the bill collection ratio further declined. In 2012, the government of Mohamed Morsi created a Ministry of Water and Sanitation, which was formerly part of the Ministry of Housing.
Responsibility for water supply and sanitation.
Policy and regulation.
Egyptian water sector policies are set by several ministries. The Ministry of Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities, created in 2012, took over its functions from the Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities that had previously been in charge of the sector. The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (previously called Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources) is in charge of water resources management and irrigation. The Ministry of Health and Population is responsible for monitoring drinking water quality. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency is responsible for environmental affairs and the assessment and monitoring of water use. The Holding Company for Water and Wastewater, founded by decree in 2004, is responsible for the financial and technical sustainability to the Governorate-based utilities. The Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency (EWRA), established in 2006, is in charge of the economic and technical regulation of utilities.
After a visit by the UN Special Rapporteur for the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in 2009, she noted limited transparency and accountability of the government to its citizens concerning water and sanitation. She received numerous accounts of complaints to the authorities about drinking water supply that remained without a response. She noted that it was "exceedingly difficult to obtain information about the quality of (...) drinking water" and "there was confusion about where to send complaints" - the Holding Company, the Ministry of Health or the Regulatory Agency. "The overlapping responsibilities create a situation where no institution considers itself accountable for the problem in question", she concluded, adding that "the overall lack of transparency and access to information in the water and sanitation sectors creates an atmosphere of suspicion, which is characterized by a lack of
confidence in the quality of drinking water and overall distrust of the Government and the Holding Company."
The Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities approved a Water and Wastewater Sector Policy Paper in September 2010, which enshrines the human right to water in the policy. As of 2012, the Ministry was in the process of elaborating a national strategy based on the policy paper, including several sub-strategies on topics such as tariffs, informal settlement and rural sanitation.
Service provision.
Public institutions.
The Ministry of Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities supervises all institutions in charge of providing water and sanitation services. Broadly speaking, these are two types of institutions: those in charge of investment and those in charge of operation. However, this separation is not always clear-cut, since some companies in charge of operation also carry out investments.
Three institutions are in charge of planning and supervision of infrastructure construction:
The Holding Company for Water and Wastewater (HCWW) and its 26 affiliated companies are in charge of operation and maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure. The Holding Company owns all water and sanitation infrastructure in Egypt. Its affiliated companies include:
In some governorates water and sewer services are still provided directly by the Holding Company. It is envisaged to establish affiliated companies in all governorates, bringing the total number of affiliated companies to 28.
Private sector participation.
The government's support for private sector participation in water supply and sanitation is focused on build-operate-transfer (BOT) for wastewater treatment plants, through which private finance is mobilized. This approach is limited to Cairo and Alexandria where external donors had become less keen to provide assistance. The first BOT wastewater for US$ 160 million for the New Cairo wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 250,000 m3/day was awarded in 2010 and is due to be completed at the end of 2012. The lead advisor for the structuring of the transaction was the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group. 
Contracts for another large wastewater treatment plant, the upgrade of the 1.2 million m3/day Abu Rawash plant for US$ 500 million, was in the prequalification process in November 2012. The Holding Company for Water and Wastewater also plans to launch BOTs for seawater desalination on the Red Sea and the Sinai, together with the government's Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) unit that would provide a sovereign guarantee. The private sector has also become involved in other functions beyond construction and consulting. For example, in Cairo, Suez and Ismailia a private company has been engaged to inspect water and wastewater networks, reduce leakage and install water meters.
Economic efficiency.
The share of non-revenue water in Egypt was estimated at 34% in 2005. Other sources estimated the level at 40-50%. The good practice benchmark in the region is in Tunisia where the level of non-revenue water is 18%.
Egyptian utilities are overstaffed. They employed 98,500 staff in 2008 for 9.5 million subscribers, equivalent to more than 10 employees per 1000 connections. Good practice for water and sanitation utilities is to have less than 5 employees.
Financial aspects.
Water and sewer tariffs in Egypt are among the lowest in the world. Despite their affordability, almost half the bills are not paid and politicians are reluctant to increase tariffs, especially since the Arab Spring. Thus only a fraction of costs is recovered through revenues from tariffs. The shortfall in revenues is partly made up by government subsidies for investment and operations at the tune of USD 2.5bn per year, of which only about 10 percent is financed by external donors.
Tariffs and other costs.
Tariff level. Water and sewer tariffs in Egypt are very low in international comparison. Customer metering is low and where meters exist they often do not work, so that vast majority of urban water consumers are still charged a flat rate which is estimated according to the kind of building. In Cairo water tariffs were 29 piastres (about 5 US cents) per m3 in 2008. Sewerage is charged as a 25% surcharge to the water bill. According to a 2009 study by GIZ, tariffs varied between 0.04 EUR per m3 in Gharbiya Governorate to 0.07 EUR per m3 in Alexandria. Based on a tariff of 5 US Cents per m3 and a consumption of 200 liter per capita and day, which is higher than in Central Europe, the monthly water bill of a family of five amounts only to the equivalent of USD 1.50.
Tariff structure. There are numerous customer classifications resulting in complex tariffs that vary, among others, depending on the customer’s line of business, the effluent produced by the customer, the seasonality of water use, and a customer’s distance from the water mains. Many water tariffs are uniform, i.e. the same tariff applies for each unit of consumption, if the water use is metered at all. Some affiliated companies have increasing-block tariffs for metered customers, i.e. the unit rate increases with consumption. But even in this case there the amount of water included in the first blocks is so large that there is little incentive to save water.
Tariff setting. Tariffs are set centrally and are almost the same all over Egypt. In certain areas they were raised after the reforms of 2005. Tariff increases have to be approved by the holding company, the national water regulatory agency EWRA, the Ministry of Water Supply and Sanitation, the Cabinet of Ministers, the President of the Republic and the National Assembly. Tariffs have not been increased since 1992. Since the Arab Spring tariff increases have become even more difficult to approve.
Affordability. According to a study done by the consulting firm Chemonics for the EU in 2009, a household consuming 218 liter per capita per day paid a water and sewer bill equivalent to 0.81% of total household expenditure. Only 11% of households (constituting 7.4% of the population) spent over 1% on water and wastewater.
Connection fees. Connection fees are a significant expenditure for households. In poor areas, connection fees are reduced and can be paid in instalments through a revolving fund established by the Holding Company, UNICEF and USAID.
Prices paid to water vendors. In some slums the majority of residents does not have legal access to water, and most people get water from tankers or water points. Because residents lack legal title over the land that they occupy, they are unable to connect legally to the water and sanitation network. Water provided by tankers costs two to three Egyptian pounds for 25 litres, approximately 300 times more than the tariff for piped water.
Costs of emptying septic tanks. The cost of emptying septic tanks can be significant. Some people avoid using their septic tanks, because if they do the tank fills up more quickly and they must pay to empty it more often. They thus continue to pollute the surrounding environment, although they have sanitation facilities at home.
Cost recovery and subsidies.
The Egyptian government highly subsidizes the sector. The estimates of the degree of cost recovery vary depending on the source of information, the years analyzed and the definition of costs. According to one estimate dating from prior to 2007, cost recovery was only 20%, with tariffs at 0.23 EP per m3 and costs at 1.10 EP per m3. According to another estimate, between 1982 and 2004 the government spent 65 billion Egyptian pounds (about 10.73 billion USD at the exchange rate of 2004) for water supply and sanitation, of which 40% was recovered through tariff revenues. According to a 2012 study by USAID, the recovery of operation and maintenance costs, excluding depreciation, through operating revenues was 95% for water supply and sanitation on average, ranging from 31% in Sinai to 134% in Beheira. The average bill collection rate was only 57%, ranging from 48% in Cairo to 85% in Beni Suef.
Investment and financing.
Investments in water supply and sanitation for Egypt exceeded USD 9.15 bn over the 20 years prior to 2007. They stood at USD 2.2bn in 2009/2010, suggesting a significant increase in investment over the previous years. However, investment declined again substantially to 4 billion Egyptian Pound (US$ 650 million) in 2011 and 3 billion Egyptian Pound (US$ 490 million) in 2012. The National Master Plan for Water Supply and Sanitation conservatively estimates the investment needs for the 30 years after 2007 at about Euro 20bn, out of which almost two thirds will be required for sanitation.
Financing. Investments are mostly financed by the government with the support of external donors. The private sector makes a limited contribution to finance, mostly through a single BOT that has so far been awarded for a US$ 160 million wastewater treatment plant. Between 2005 and 2010 Egypt received more than 1bn Euro in external aid for water supply and sanitation, out of which 30% were grants and the remainder soft loans with an average interest rate of 1%. This corresponds to EUR 200 million per year, corresponding to only about 10% of the government's investment budget for the sector in 2009/10. According to the Ministry of Housing, government subsidies to water and wastewater utilities amounted to more than 15 billion Egyptian pounds (USD 2.5bn) in 2009/10, including EP 13.4bn (USD 2.2bn) investment subsidies, EP 0.66 bn (USD 0.1bn) operating subsidies and EP 1 bn (USD 0.2bn) repair and rehabilitation subsidies.
External cooperation.
The European Union, France, Germany, the United States and the World Bank are among the most important external cooperation partners in the Egyptian water and sanitation sector in terms of funding. Several other bilateral donors, as well as UNDP and UNICEF, are also active in the sector.
European donors increasingly fund projects jointly under the EU's Neighborhood Investment Facility (NIF), which supports the Improved Water and Wastewater Services Program (IWSP) in four governorates in the Delta during its first phase (Gharbia, Sharkia, Damietta, and Beheira) and four governorates in Upper Egypt during its second phase. IWSP pools loans from Germany, France and the European Investment Bank as well as a grant from the European Commission, which is used as an incentive for the other donors to pool their loans and to thus harmonize their procedures.
There is a water donor group co-chaired by the EU and the Netherlands. As of 2012, the Netherlands was in the process of phasing out its assistance to the water and sanitation sector.
European Union.
The European Union provides budget support in the form of grants, institutional strengthening, the support of a National Master Plan for Water Supply and Sanitation, as well as financing for a radio network and water meters. Budget support is through a so-called Water Sector Reform Programme, including a first phase of 80 million Euro (2005–2009) and a second phase of 120 million Euro (2011–2015). Funds for institutional strengthening are provided to the Egyptian Water Regulatory Authority (6m Euro for 2008–2010 and 1.5m for 2011–2013) and the Holding Company (1.5m Euro for 2011–2013). The EU also co-finances investment jointly funded with bilateral European donors and the European Investment Bank, in particular the Improved Water and Wastewater Services Program IWSP.
France.
The French Development Agency supports the IWSP (see above). It contributes with 40 million Euro to the total project cost of 295 million Euro.
Germany.
Germany provides investment finance and technical assistance for projects in Qena and Kafr El Sheikh, as well as for the IWSP (see above), for which KfW is the lead donor. The technical cooperation agency GIZ is active in strengthening the capacity of the Holding Company and the two affiliated companies in Qena and Kafr el Sheikh.
United States.
The United States has supported the development of Egypt’s water and sanitation sector since the early 1980s. It provided support to the sector reforms that established the holding company and the regulatory agency. USAID funded wastewater treatment plants throughout the country, including in Alexandria where it financed the expansion of the wastewater collection and treatment system to elimination raw wastewater discharge into the sea. It also financed technical assistance to the Alexandria General Water Authority (AGWA) through a strategic plan, training and a management information system. 
It also financed water treatment plants in villages in Minya and Beni Suef Governorate as well as in Mansoura City, the capital of Dakahlia Governorate, all in the Nile Delta. In 2008 USAID began two technical assistance projects, one to provide managerial systems and tools to utilities, the other aimed at "developing a strategic plan for the sector", "creating a framework for public-private partnerships", and "improving investment planning" at the national level.
World Bank.
The Integrated Sanitation and Sewerage Infrastructure Project was approved in 2008 and is expected to end in 2014. Its main objective is the sustainable improvement of the sanitation and environmental conditions as well as the water quality in the three Delta Governorates of Beheira, Gharbia and Kafr El-Sheikh. Furthermore, a local result-based monitoring and evaluation system will be established in order to improve sanitation coverage and thus environmental and health conditions. The project also contains a component of institutional development and capacity building. According to the World Bank, the project is the first large scale effort to address rural sanitation in Egypt. The total cost of the project is 201.5 million USD, out of which the World Bank provides more than half (120 million USD). A second phase of the project, extending it to four more governorates (Menoufia and Sharkia in the Delta, Assiut and Sohag in Upper Egypt) was approved in 2011 with a volume of 200 million USD.
Others.
The following other external partners were active in the sector in 2008:

Karl Godulla

Karl Godulla, Carolus Godulla, in Polish spelled Karol Godula (born 8 November 1781 in Makoschau, today Makoszowy, a subdivision of Zabrze, Silesia; died 6 July 1848 in Breslau, today Wrocław) was a Silesian self-made industrialist ("the king of zinc"), and one of the best-known pioneers in the industrial development of Prussian Silesia.
Life.
Godulla grew up in modest conditions and went into the services to count von Ballestrem, who promoted the intelligent, ambitious and skillful young man. In 1807, Godulla was promoted to be the manager at the count estate, and in 1818 ascended to become the overseer of all his goods. In 1812, the zinc smelter "Karlhütte" construction began, and Godulla became its manager. He received from the count 28 shares ("freikuxen") in this new smelter, and this started his own business career.
Soon, Godulla acquired his own coal mines, calamine mines and zinc smelters. He attained a large fortune, partly through introduction of new industrial processes into the fast developing industry of Silesia. By the time of his death, Godulla owned 80 zinc mines, 4 zinc smelters, 48 coal mines and considerable real estate. Godulla was considered to be an economic person, who lived rather in his little wooden house in Ruda Slaska than in his palace at Schomberg (Szombierki), nowadays, a subdivision of Bytom. He was also known to be very industrious man, who allowed himself little peace, and who imposed these standards on his employees and workers of his industrial establishments. He declined knighthood allegedly stating that "the greatest nobility comes from the memory of an actful life".
Legacy.
Godulla remained unmarried and childless. He adopted a child of a worker, Johanna Gryzik (1842-1910), who at the age of 6 inherited Godulla's fortune, at 16 was ennobled by Friedrich Wilhelm IV to Gryzik von Schomberg-Godulla, a month later married count Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch, and then successfully administered by herself the business empire, one of the largest in Germany. After WWII, the descendants of the family were expelled from Silesia, her grave was emptied, and most of the property destroyed.
A subdivision of Ruda Śląska ("Godula", de:"Godullahütte") has historically been named after Carolus Godulla. Following the fall of communism, the Godula Upper-Silesian Higher Business School in Chorzów was established. Godula's name was also given to a college in Ruda Śląska-Halemba (Zespół Szkół Ponadgimnazjalnych nr 3) and a primary school in Ruda Śląska-Godula (Szkoła Podstawowa Nr 40) and a high school in Bytom-Szombierki (Gimnazjum Nr 6). His daughter's name has recently (2007) been given to an elementary school (3) in Ruda Śląska (in today's Polish version, her name is spelled "hrabina Joanna Gryzik von Schaffgotsch").
Legends.
As a young man, Godulla was disfigured, possibly by poachers, with business of whose he successfully interfered (part of his hired job). He lost an eye, use of one hand, had a disfigured face, permanent limp, and (allegedly) lost masculinity. Folk legends had it that he cut a deal with the devil (this was to explain his exceptionally good business fortune, the late-night experiments in chemistry, and personal oddities).

<doc id="21356970" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21356970" title="Johannes Kepler ATV">
Johannes Kepler ATV

The "Johannes Kepler" ATV, or Automated Transfer Vehicle 002 (ATV-002), was an unmanned cargo spacecraft built to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). It was launched on 16 February 2011 by the European Space Agency (ESA). "Johannes Kepler" carried propellant, air and dry cargo weighing over , and had a total mass of over , making it, at the time, the heaviest payload launched by the ESA. The spacecraft was named after the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler.
"Johannes Kepler" was the second ATV cargo resupply vehicle to be launched, following the "Jules Verne" mission of 2008. "Johannes Kepler" carried around five tonnes more cargo than Russia's Progress-M resupply spacecraft, and about 1.5 tonnes more than the Japanese HTV. The ATV used of fuel to boost the ISS's altitude from 350 to 400 km.
Many of the supplies aboard the ATV were used for the Space Shuttle mission STS-133 and the ISS Expedition 26. A Reentry Breakup Recorder was placed aboard the ATV before it undocked from the ISS on 20 June 2011. "Johannes Kepler" performed a destructive re-entry as intended on 21 June 2011, with its remains impacting the Pacific Ocean.
Spacecraft.
"Johannes Kepler" consisted of two sections: the Propulsion Module, with four main engines and 28 smaller maneuvering thrusters, and the Integrated Cargo Carrier, which attached directly to the ISS and could hold up to eight standard payload racks. The four solar wings of the spacecraft provided up to 4,800 watts of electrical power to its rechargeable batteries.
The ATV's rendezvous and docking system mounted a telegoniometer, which functioned as a radar system, and two videometers, which fired laser pulses at cube-shaped reflectors on the ISS' "Zvezda" service module for range detection. The nose of the spacecraft contained rendezvous sensors and Russian docking equipment.
Mission payload.
GeoFlow II.
"Johannes Kepler" delivered the GeoFlow II hydrodynamics experiment container to the ISS. This experiment was designed to observe liquid movements in microgravity, and compare them with computer simulations, thus helping scientists to understand convection currents within the Earth’s mantle.
Mission summary.
Launch.
On 16 February 2011 UTC, "Johannes Kepler" was launched on an Ariane 5ES rocket from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. The launch was conducted by Arianespace on behalf of the ESA.
The first launch attempt, on 15 February 2011, was halted four minutes before lift-off, due to an erroneous signal from one of the rocket's fuel tanks.
Docking.
Docking with the ISS was completed on 24 February 2011 at 15:59 UTC, after a 15-minute delay. The spacecraft traveled over eight days to catch up with the space station, and arrived at the aft port of the station's "Zvezda" service module. During the rendezvous operations, ATV-2 traveled a total of 2.5 million miles. The docking occurred as ATV-2 and the ISS flew over the coast of Liberia in western Africa. Hooks and latches engaged a few minutes later to firmly attach ATV-2 to the ISS.
The "Johannes Kepler" mission marked the first time European astronauts were on board the International Space Station during an ATV mission, with Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli welcoming the ATV's arrival. ESA astronaut Roberto Vittori was also aboard the ISS at the same time as the ATV, having arrived on Space Shuttle "Endeavour" on the STS-134 mission in May 2011.
ISS altitude Increase.
"Johannes Kepler" was used to boost the ISS's standard altitude from about 350 kilometers (220 statute miles) to 400 km (248 miles). The higher altitude has lower atmospheric drag, which reduces the propellant needed annually to maintain the station's altitude from 6,800 kg (19,000 lb) to roughly 3,630 kg (8,000 lb), depending on atmospheric conditions. The ATV used about 4,500 kg (9,900 lb) of rocket fuel to accomplish this change, with the reboost occurring incrementally over several months.
End of mission and deorbit.
On 20 June 2011, "Johannes Kepler" undocked from the ISS. At 18:30 UTC (20:30 CEST) that same day, while preparing to deorbit, the ATV was forced to conduct a debris-avoidance maneuver, using some of its remaining fuel to move into a safe orbit after NASA warned of a potential collision with orbital debris. On 21 June 2011, the ATV deorbited, burning up in the atmosphere as planned over the South Pacific Ocean at around 22:44 CET.

U.S. Route 11 in Louisiana

U.S. Highway 11 in Louisiana (US 11) runs from the national southern terminus at US 90 in New Orleans to the Mississippi state line south of Picayune. The route parallels Interstate 10 (I-10) across Lake Pontchartrain and into Slidell, serving as that city's major north–south arterial. After crossing I-12, it parallels I-59 to Pearl River, at which point the two highways proceed concurrently across the state line.
The portion of US 11 between Slidell and Pearl River was once part of the Old Spanish Trail, an early auto trail that largely became the route of US 90 when the numbered U.S. Highway System was implemented in 1926. US 11 originally terminated in Mississippi just northwest of what is now the John C. Stennis Space Center. In 1937, US 90 was relocated onto a new route bypassing Slidell and Pearl River, significantly reducing the distance between New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast. US 11 was extended into Louisiana two years later over the former alignment of US 90, and the two routes proceeded concurrently into Downtown New Orleans. In 1951, US 11 was cut back to its current southern terminus at US 90 in Eastern New Orleans.
Until the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the area during the late 1950s to mid-1960s, US 11 was one of two major routes eastward out of New Orleans, the other being US 90. Both still serve as important alternate routes to I-10 when hurricanes threaten the area, as was perhaps most evident when, in August 2005, Hurricane Katrina heavily damaged the nearby I-10 Twin Span Bridge over Lake Pontchartrain, rendering the crossing completely impassible for over six weeks. (The US 11 Bridge, constructed in 1928, had sustained only minor damage.) North of Pearl River, US 11 does not serve a similar function, however, since it was moved onto I-59 in 1965 and no longer retains a separate crossing over the west and east branches of the Pearl River.
Route description.
From the south, US 11 begins at an intersection with US 90 (Chef Menteur Highway) in Eastern New Orleans between Michoud and Venetian Isles. It proceeds north as an undivided, two-lane highway for through an area known as Irish Bayou to Point Aux Herbes, where it passes through an interchange with I-10 at Exit 254. US 11 immediately continues northeast onto the Maestri Bridge, a 4.8 mile (7.7 km)-long span across Lake Pontchartrain that parallels the I-10 Twin Span Bridge.
About midway across the lake, US 11 crosses from Orleans Parish (coextensive with the city of New Orleans) into St. Tammany Parish and begins to closely follow along the east side of the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) trestle. Making landfall in North Shore, US 11 becomes known as Pontchartrain Drive and passes through the community of Eden Isle. US 11 gains a center turning lane at Oak Harbor Boulevard, and immediately afterward, the highway enters the city of Slidell and widens to accommodate a second lane in either direction.
In Slidell, US 11 curves to the northwest and intersects LA 433 (Old Spanish Trail). The center lane disappears, and the two highways become concurrent for a short distance until an intersection with Front Street. Here, US 11 turns back to the northeast alongside the Norfolk Southern Railway tracks while LA 433 continues straight ahead across the rail line. US 11 follows Front Street through Slidell's historic district and intersects US 190 Business at Fremaux Avenue, beginning a brief concurrency for several blocks to an intersection with mainline US 190 at Gause Boulevard. Here US 190 Business reaches its western terminus, and US 11 continues northward along Front Street, narrowing again to an undivided, two-lane highway. Just beyond Indiana Avenue, a local street, US 11 crosses to the west side of the Norfolk Southern tracks via an overpass. Proceeding north for , US 11 reaches the northern limit of Slidell and enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-12 at Exit 83, briefly widening to a divided, four-lane highway. I-12 heads west toward Mandeville and Covington and east to a major interchange with I-10 and I-59.
Returning to two-lane capacity, US 11 continues north through a sparsely-developed area known as Alton and intersects LA 1091 (Robert Boulevard). later, US 11 enters the town of Pearl River and intersects LA 41 (Watts Road), which heads north toward Bogalusa. From this intersection, LA 3081 continues north along Main Street while US 11 turns southeast onto Concord Boulevard. Shortly afterward, US 11 enters an interchange with I-59 at Exit 3, which also marks the northern terminus of LA 1090 (Military Road). US 11 turns north to follow the on-ramp to I-59 and utilizes the interstate's alignment for the remainder of the distance in Louisiana.
After , I-59/US 11 reaches Exit 5A, which forms the northern terminus of LA 3081 and provides another connection to Pearl River. Immediately following this interchange, the highway crosses the northern town limit and proceeds onto a bridge over the West Pearl River. Just north of the bridge is Exit 5B, an interchange with a local road known as Old US 11, part of the pre-interstate alignment that now serves the Pearl River Wildlife Management Area. I-59/US 11 proceeds northward through the Honey Island Swamp and, after , reaches its final interchange, Exit 11 (Pearl River Turnaround). It then crosses the main branch of the Pearl River into Mississippi at a point south of Picayune.
History.
Mississippi termini.
As originally designated in November 1926, the southern terminus of US 11 was located in Santa Rosa, Mississippi at a junction with US 90, the present intersection of Mississippi Highway 607 (MS 607) and Old US 11. At that time, US 90 followed the general route of US 11 through Slidell and Pearl River. After crossing the state line into Mississippi, US 90 intersected US 11 then curved back to the south, bypassing Pearlington on the way to Bay St. Louis. This route duplicated that of the Old Spanish Trail, an auto trail designated in 1916, pre-dating the numbered U.S. Highway System. Since 1921, the Louisiana portion had also carried the designation of State Route 2, as did all of US 90 throughout the state.
In December 1935, the current route of US 90 running directly between the Rigolets Bridge and Pearlington was opened, shortening the distance from New Orleans to the Mississippi Gulf Coast by . Once US 90 was officially shifted onto the cutoff in June 1937, US 11 was extended south to meet it at the present intersection of MS 604 and MS 607. The following year, a second cutoff was opened, placing US 90 on its current alignment between Pearlington and MS 607 west of Waveland. US 11 was again extended to intersect US 90, following MS 604 southward into Pearlington.
Extension into Louisiana.
In June 1939, the Louisiana Highway Commission successfully petitioned the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) to have US 11 moved onto the former route of US 90 through Pearl River and Slidell and joined with US 90 to the intersection of Canal and North Broad Streets in New Orleans. From the original southern terminus at Santa Rosa, US 11 then followed what is known as Old US 11, now a largely abandoned local road, to the state line where it crossed a now-demolished bridge over the Pearl River. It then continued onto Old US 11 in Louisiana, locally maintained today as part of the Pearl River State Wildlife Management Area, to the site of the interchange with I-59 and the current route of US 11. Continuing southwest, US 11 crossed a second demolished bridge over the West Pearl River, entering the town of Pearl River. It then followed Main Street through town, state-maintained today as part of LA 3081 and LA 3081 Spur, and rejoined the present alignment at LA 41 (Watts Road). Maps from 1939 indicate that US 11 briefly continued along the former route of US 90, turning southeast onto LA 433 to an intersection with current US 90 at the Rigolets Bridge. Including the concurrency with US 90 into Downtown New Orleans, this routing would have represented the longest expanse of US 11 in Louisiana, totaling .
The permanent re-routing of US 11 as approved by AASHO became effective on January 1, 1940. At this time, US 11 assumed its present routing across Lake Pontchartrain via the Maestri Bridge. Originally known as the Pontchartrain Bridge (or Watson-Williams Bridge, after its backers), the nearly 5 mile (8 km)-long span was opened on February 18, 1928 and initially operated as a toll bridge. The bridge was the subject of much controversy and was a hot issue in several political campaigns during the 1920s. Louisiana Governor Oramel H. Simpson successfully advocated for free bridges to be constructed for US 90 across Chef Menteur Pass and the Rigolets, and though the route was longer, the completion of the free spans in 1929 and 1930 led to the financial ruin of the toll bridge. In December 1938, the state of Louisiana purchased the Pontchartrain Bridge at auction, eliminated the tolls, and re-named it after New Orleans' mayor, Robert S. Maestri. Once US 11 was routed onto the Maestri Bridge, it continued south through Irish Bayou to its present southern terminus at US 90 and continued into town co-signed with US 90. The contemporary route of US 90 followed the current route from US 11 to Michoud; Old Gentilly Road to a point formerly known as Lee Station, where it rejoined Chef Menteur Highway; Chef Menteur Highway across the Industrial Canal and onto Gentilly Boulevard; Gentilly Boulevard to Paris Avenue; then south onto Paris and St. Bernard Avenues to North Broad Street; and finally, southwest onto North Broad Street to Canal Street. This routing of US 11 in Louisiana totaled .
In May 1942, the opening of the Michoud Cutoff on Chef Menteur Highway bypassed the portion of Old Gentilly Road between Lee Station and Michoud, straightening the route of US 11-90 and eliminating two grade crossings. In 1951, the Louisiana Department of Highways eliminated several U.S. Highway concurrencies. US 51 and US 65 were removed from their concurrencies with US 61 into New Orleans, and US 11 was truncated to its present southern terminus near Irish Bayou. The number of U.S. Highway designations intersecting at Canal and North Broad Streets was thus reduced from five to two (US 61 and US 90).
Interstate 59.
In July 1963, construction of I-59 was completed from Pearl River northward across the Mississippi state line with the opening of the I-59 West Pearl River Bridge. The US 11 West Pearl River Bridge, originally opened in 1926, was closed due to safety reasons in 1964 and slated for demolition. US 11 traffic was detoured onto I-59 via Exit 3 at LA 1090 (Military Road). This detour became permanent the following year with US 11 assuming its current routing co-signed with I-59 between Pearl River and Nicholson, Mississippi. The move was unpopular with the St. Tammany Parish police jury and with residents of Pearl River who would now have to travel several miles out of their way to reach Picayune, Mississippi. In response, the Louisiana Department of Highways reopened the bridge to local traffic only to declare it unsafe again in 1968. After further protests, the state made temporary repairs to the bridge to serve local traffic until an additional interchange was constructed to better connect the town with northbound I-59. Exit 5A on I-59/US 11 was opened in 1971 as part of LA 41 Spur (now LA 3081), and the old US 11 bridge was demolished.

VideoAge International

VideoAge International is a TV trade magazine based in New York City, with offices in Los Angeles, California and Milan, Italy.
Known simply as VideoAge, it is published by TV Trade Media, Inc. It comes out seven times per year. It also publishes dailies during major international TV trade shows.
History.
Early History
"VideoAge" was launched in 1981 by Dom (Domenico) Serafini, when the international television industry was still in its infancy. The magazine made its first appearance at VIDCOM, television trade market in Cannes that was a precursor of MIPCOM. The name "VideoAge" was chosen because the time of its launch, 1981, was the age of video. Indeed the “video age” soon after became The New York Times’ favorite expression to describe the foreseen 500-channel universe (of the “push” type). When "VideoAge" was introduced the television sector already had five publications: "Variety", "The Hollywood Reporter", "Broadcasting", "Television/Radio Age (magazine)" and, in the U.K., "TV World". Both "TV/Radio Age" and "TV World" went out of business in the late '80s. Dom Serafini, a former international editor of "TV/Radio Age", created "VideoAge" with a unique formula: The key companies in the TV business upfronted the money in exchange for ad pages. Among the first 20 supporting companies were: MGM, MIFED, Rusconi Editori, CBN (Pat Robertson), Canale 5 (Silvio Berlusconi), ABC TV stations, Eastman Kodak and Brazil’s Globo TV.
In early 1983 "VideoAge" introduced, at NATPE in Las Vegas, the industry’s first trade show daily (subsequently branded as The TV Executive) by using Polaroid pictures for the photo-page. This was an era without one-hour photo developing, without easily available fax machines and, in lieu of yet unfamiliar cell phones, bulky walkie-talkies and pagers were used. The yellow "VideoAge" T-shirts were then worn as a way to identify reporters on the trade floor. Among the first companies to support "VideoAge"’s dailies were: Enter-Tel, France’s TF1 and Telepictures. Today, the concept of dailies has been rendered more valuable by online services, which, in the hectic market schedules, are limited to e-mail checking, while trade news is more convenient in the printed format. The Magazine initially served an audience that tended to know more than the journalists did. They reported on events that most readers were aware of beforehand, and they could only cover the tip of the "iceberg." Additionally, they had to walk a fine line and report on people and companies that were also their advertisers.
The magazine began making use of self-titled "dailies" or daily issues only introduced during selected Television trade markets, in 1984. "VideoAge" opened with an office in New York, and soon expended to Los Angeles, London, and Milan. There is also a branch office in Osaka, Japan.
Later History
"VideoAge" eventually defined its topics of study along the following lines, regulations, sociology, psychographics, finances, production, distribution, ratings, broadcasting, cablecasting, satellite, IPTV, piracy, as well as introductions to new technology, and attempts to make complex new technological topics digestible to non-geeks and rich technophobes. The vast majority of it' current business model deals with competing with the television trade's 10 other publications that cover all aspects of television, especially international TV In addition, to the many more which cover specialized TV fields such as mobile video, Internet-TV, cable and/or satellite TV. "VideoAge" was one of the first trades to enter online services in 1997, first with its English site (www.VideoAge.org), followed by the Spanish-language site (www.VideoAgeLatin.com) and its Italian-language version (www.VideoAgeItalia.com). The website contains archival issues and can be found, here. Archive material can also be found at: http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.videoageinternational.com
Current.
The magazine's main market is at television trade shows where it is distributed free of charge. It does contain a minute newsstand presence, and can be found in the lobby of a variety of Los Angeles hotels, especially around the time of the LA Screenings. Revenue comes entirely under the form of profit from advertisers. The magazine occasionally prints with a Spanish-language section. A presence in South America is budding, and the magazine has strong ties with a Brazilian trade show in São Paulo. The magazine also has a web presence, releasing occasional online press statements and videos documenting the magazine's presence at trade shows. The website offers a variety of services, none of them all that useful, and can be seen here.
Format
"VideoAge" utilizes a tabloid format and prints in full color. Advertisements are for the most part full-page, although the front cover prints with a smaller ad caption. The vast majority of the articles do not report simple facts as much as examine the television industry; the magazine is thus somewhat popular in universities where it's utilized as a primary reference source and object of study in a variety of classes. The scope of the magazine tends to focus more on those companies that advertise on it. The magazine differs from its contenders, such as Variety, in the sense that it does not dispatch reporters to stories, nor does it engage in conventional reporting practices. Because the magazine only has a real presence in trade shows, its scope tends to focus on those.
Online services.
"VideoAge" maintains three web sites in English, Spanish and Italian. Published articles can be viewed as PDFs (full issue and full page) and a selected few as text.

St. Leo's Roman Catholic Church, Mimico

St. Leo's Roman Catholic Church is a Catholic church in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Royal York Rd (formerly Church St) at Stanley, in the Mimico neighbourhood, formerly part of Etobicoke. It is the oldest Catholic church in Etobicoke and the only Catholic church in Mimico.
History.
The first services were held at Eden Court (515 Royal York Rd) the home of Mr Edward Stock, one of only three remaining Victorian Houses on Royal York with St. Leo's Rectory, the building has recently been declared a historic building. Mr. Stock donated land for the original church in 1895 which opened as a mission of Holy Family in 1903. 
In 1909 St. Leo's became a parish serving Swansea south of the College St extension (now Morningside Ave) and Mimico with its original boundaries: Lake Ontario, the Humber River, North Queen St (now Delroy Dr) and Mimico Ave (now Kipling Ave). One of ten famous races run between athletes Tom Longboat and Alf Shrubb took place for St. Leo's parish picnic at an old Mimico park in 1912 the same year St. Leo's extensively extended the church, doubling its capacity. St. Leo's casualties for the First World War were 1 killed (Pte. Ed Doherty), 5 wounded out of 30 enlisted. In 1920 the former western portion of Mimico became the Town of New Toronto, leading in 1924 to the building of St. Teresa's Catholic Church and the separation of this area from St. Leo's. In 1923 the Town of Mimico had opened a second Public school and in 1926 the parish built St. Leo Elementary School across from the church on land bought from Mimico's Werner family which led to the creation of the Mimico Separate School Board which often met at the old Rectory, 48 Station Rd across from the Mimico Library. St. Leo Elementary School is the oldest Separate School in Etobicoke still open. Like the Town of Mimico and its other churches, St. Leo's went deeply into debt during the Great Depression. With much post war Italian immigration to the northern half of Mimico, in 1947 the Mimico Separate School Board opened a second Catholic school for the parish north of the QEW; St. Louis Elementary School the name likely suggested by the name of the pastor at the time (the first Italian-speaking pastor) Fr. Louis Markle. All of St. Leo's early clergy served at the mother church of Holy Family (except Fr. Markle, whose brother Fr. Basil Markle served there). All the early pastors but the first (Fr. Doherty) taught at St. Augustine's Seminary, a tradition carried on by the current pastor.
A new church was built across the street from the old in 1953 on the site of Mimico's 1858 post office. Shortly after, the parish made a concerted effort to buy the next door Postmaster's Home, Werner House, to be the new rectory. In 1955 St. Mark's Catholic Church was built in Humber Bay neighbourhood and in 1961 Holy Angels was built for The Queensway neighourhood, the area having been cut off from Mimico by the building of the Queen Elizabeth Way. After liturgical changes in the Latin Rite led to the use of the vernacular (English) in place of Latin, St. Leo's began providing a separate liturgy for Italian parishioners. In 1960 a Parish Hall was built on the site of the Old Church. Both elementary schools were extensively added to throughout the 1960s as Mimico was amalgamated with Etobicoke, St. Leo's parish replacing Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church, Kingsway as the oldest Catholic parish in Etobicoke. After full funding for Catholic Schools was introduced, the Public Board of Education offered the old Mimico High School to the Separate (Catholic) School Board which declined on the grounds that demographics changes in Etobicoke meant Mimico was no longer centrally located.
Four St. Leo's parishioners have received the Sacrament of Holy Orders: Fr. Jim Passery (ordained in the church on the 50th anniversary of the parish), Deacon Ralph Yearsley, Deacon Gord Weiss, and Deacon Alan Morris. One of St. Leo's most celebrated former parishioners is NHL Hockey Player Brendan Shanahan. St. Leo's is also home to the Fourth Lakeshore Beavers, Cubs and Scouts.

Anna Ranch Heritage Center

Anna Ranch Heritage Center is a former cattle ranch in Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii named for Anna Leialoha Lindsey Perry-Fiske (1900–1995).
Early history.
The ranch began in the early 19th century when an Englishman James Fay (c. 1778–1858) married a native Hawaiian woman Kaipukaiikapuokamehameha Kahahana about 1828. Their daughter Mary Kaala Fay (1830–1886) had 12 children. Her second marriage was to George Kynaston Lindsey (1832–1872), who bought the land in 1858. Their oldest son Thomas Weston Lindsey (1855–1912), married Beke Fredenberg and had eight children. Thomas' oldest son William Miller Seymour Lindsey (1875–1939) married Mary Leialoha Rose. Their only daughter was Anna Leialoha.
Anna Lindsey first moved to Hilo, Hawaii, but divorced her first husband Henry Lai Hipp in 1939 and moved back to the ranch to manage it. The business was heavily in debt, so she performed most of the work herself. In 1943 Anna Lindsey married James Lyman Perry-Fiske. Atypically for the time, she managed the ranch until her death in 1995. In 1968 Anna was named “Career Woman of the Year” by the Hawai’i Federation of Business and Professional Women. In 1983 she was credited as the biggest individual contributor to the Hawaii American Heart Association chapter.
In 2009 she became a member of the Paniolo Hall of Fame.
Major buildings include a ranch house, slaughter house, barn and garage constructed between 1910 and 1930. The preserved ranch house and outbuildings have become a historic house museum. After being restored to 1939 condition, the house was opened for tours in September 2007.
It was listed as site 06001120 on the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii April 28, 2008. It is located on Hawaii Belt Road (state Route 19, also called Kawaihae Road at this point) at coordinates .

Albert F. Schoepper

Albert F. Schoepper (October 22, 1913 - July 29, 1997) was leader of the United States Marine Band and White House music consultant from 1955 to 1972. 
Albert Schoepper was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Albert O. Schoepper and Matilda "Matie" Stehler. He began his musical training at age 7 with the violinist Alfred Perrot. He attended East High School in Rochester, and studied at the Eastman School of Music under Gustav Tinlot. He also studied violin and conducting under Andrew Polah at Syracuse University. 
Schoepper joined the Marine Band in 1934, playing violin and saxophone. He often appeared as a violin soloist on network radio programs and was named concert master of the Marine Chamber Orchestra. He first conducted at the White House in 1942. He spent 38 years with the band. He joined the band as an enlisted man in 1934, playing violin and saxophone, and became the first Marine Band director to reach the rank of full colonel. 
Col. Schoepper performed as a soloist and conductor before royalty and heads of state and government at hundreds of White House engagements. His first White House appearance as conductor in 1942 before King George II of Greece. Later, when the White House was being renovated, he conducted all the Blair House engagements for Harry S. Truman. 
In 1955 Schoepper replaced William F. Santelmann as Marine Band Director. Col. Schoepper directed "The President's Own" (as the Marine Band is known) at the inaugurations of Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon. 
Schoepper was in charge of the band for 17 years. He took the full band on 18 concert tours, during which he estimated that it played before some 12 million people. Schoepper also served as music adviser to the White House. He helped organize soirees with the country's finest artists and appearances of its most popular performers. 
During the Johnson Administration, members of the White House social staff, as the story is told, had a "frank exchange of views" because they considered Col. Schoepper too indulgent of Mr. Johnson's passion for the foxtrot, neglecting other rhythms that his dancing guests might have favored. 
For his last performance at the White House, Schoepper led the Marine Chamber Orchestra at a reception for retiring members of Congress. Once the final chord faded, President Nixon introduced him and toasted him as the guests stood and saluted. 
Schoepper died July 29, 1997 in Alexandria, Virginia of pneumonia, weeks after experiencing a stroke that he never recovered from.

Qazim Dervishi

Qazim Dervishi (10 June 1908 – 19 January 1994) was the first Albanian international referee and a talented athlete and footballer. He was born in 1908 in the city of Shkodër in a noble family of the time. In his honour the sports arena of Shkodër is now called Qazim Dervishi Sports Arena.
Life.
Dervishi was born in Shkodër, on June 10, 1908. Since his childhood he had a passion for all kinds of sports and he practiced football and basketball during his teenage years. In 1924 he entered the "Harry Fultz" Technical School in Tirana. The motto of the school at that time was "If we rest we rust" (). After finishing school he started teaching basketball and he started training a team in Shkodër. He is known as the "man who brought basketball from Technical School" because of the popularity he gave the sport in his native city. In 1930 he was named headmaster of the "Malet Tona" campus in Shkodër. In 1939 he was transferred to the city of Pogradec to work as a teacher but came back to Shkodër in 1942. Just three years after, he was named president of the sportive society KS Vllaznia. In the years 1946-1947 he transferred to Gjirokastër where he taught the local youths the sport of basketball for the first time. During 1947 he worked in the Peqin-Kavaje railway as an instructor on physical education. That is where he was arrested by the communist government because of his sympathy to ex-King of Albanians Ahmet Zogu. This was influenced from the fact that he had studied in the "Harry Fultz" Technical School where most of the dissidents of the communist regime had studied. A 22-month investigation was made from the "Sigurimi" that "found enough proofs" to declare him guilty of propaganda against the communist regime. He was punished with a sentence of 18 years but he served only until 1954 because of very bad health conditions. He was paralyzed and he managed to get a paralysis financial assistance. In 1993 he was given the title "The Nation's Teacher" for his contribution in sports. In 2009 the Council of the Municipality of Shkoder accorded to him the title "Honorary Citizen". He died in January 1994 in the age of 86 years old, honored from the Albanian people.
Sporting activities.
As soon as Dervishi went for studies in Tirana, he started taking part in the sportive activities that were held in the school and often was named among the excellent students in sports. He practised and contributed in athletics, basketball, football, etc. It should be mentioned that in an interview of Master Irfan Tershana, it is stated that Qazim was also one of the best baseball players of the Technical School.
Basketball.
The first ever official basketball match in Albania was played on March 2, 1928 between the Technical School and the "Malet Tona" campus. For the Technical School captain was Qazim Dervishi. The match was won from the boys of the Technical School with the result of 32-14. In 1929 he is named headmaster in the "Malet Tona" campus in Shkodër. Even here along with the headmaster duties, Dervishi gave a primary importance to the sports practising. After a year of training, on June 27, 1930 was held the first basketball match in the city of Shkodër between the local team of the "Malet Tona" campus and the "Naim Frasheri" club from Tirana. The match was played in a regular size field and for the first time in Shkodër were put the baskets. Dervishi was the referee for this game, which ended in a tie. In the years 1933-1934, in the Perash elementary school where he was working (the only mixed school at that time) he started the women's basketball which became also popular.
Career as a referee.
After 1939, Dervishi took another direction, that of a referee and of the director of the physical education. In this year he finishes a 3-months training to classify himself as a referee. On February 22, 1946 he presided the first ever international match between Albania and Montenegro. He also was the only Albanian referee in the 1946 Balkan Games where the Albanian national football team won the championship. He presided a match as the main referee (Yugoslavia-Bulgaria, 2-1) and another one as a linesman (Albania-Romania, 1-0).

Émile Bernard chronology

This is an Émile Bernard chronology of the life and career of French artist, art critic and writer Émile Bernard, based on documents hitherto published - however, most of the relevant sources remain unpublished. To a certain extent, these gaps can be filled by information derived from letters and biographies of e.g. Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin and Émile Schuffenecker. Bernard and his work is associated with Post-Impressionism, Cloisonnism and Synthetism.
Since 1891, Bernard used to date his letters.
1860s 1870s 1880s 1890s 1900s 1910s 1920s 1930s 1940s 
"The Vanguard Years:" 1884 1886 1887 1888 1889 1890 1891 1892 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897
FootnotesAt that time, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Louis Anquetin, Eugène Boch and Paul Tampier (1859–1940) were studying with Cormon. At Père Tanguy's shop, he first saw some of Cézanne's paintings. Toulouse-Lautrec and Anquetin introduced young Bernard to Montmartre's night life. In 1885, Bernard created his first important work, the woodblock "La Nativité."
1886.
After having been expelled by Cormon for insubordinate behaviour in early spring, 1886, his parents tried to convince him to work in business, which he refused. Financially supported by the parents, Bernard instead went on a foot trip to Brittany. Recommended by Claude-Émile Schuffenecker, whom he had met at Concarneau, he went to Pont-Aven in July, to see Paul Gauguin who however at first did not recognize Bernard's talent. Returned home after two months, he moved in with his parents, visited the exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants and saw the work of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac.
1887.
When his parents rented a house in Asnières, Émile was able to exhibit pointillist works there, early in the year, and was invited by Seurat to visit his studio. Bernard and Anquetin however soon decided to break with Neo-Impressionism and go their own way, painting flat colour areas but strong black contours.
At Tanguy's, Bernard met Lucien Pissarro and Charles Angrand at that time.
In spring, he returned to Brittany and stayed two months in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer, where he created stained glass windows. After his grandmother started to live with the family, they moved to a bigger house and built a studio for Émile.
1888.
On occasion of the Salon des Indépendants in March 1888, the art critic Édouard Dujardin coined Bernard's and Anquetin's new style Cloisonnism.
1890.
After returning to Paris, Bernard had to find out that Charlotte was meanwhile engaged to someone else. Madeleine became engaged to Charles Laval, who also was obliged to proof that he would be able to maintain a family. After losing his parental allowance, Émile organized a lottery of his paintings. 
1893.
Deciding to go abroad, together with Maria, Bernard was supported by Count Antoine de La Rochefoucauld and Andries Bonger. He first travelled Italy: On visits in Genova, Pisa, Rome and Florence he admired Perugino, Botticelli, Giotto, Simone Martini, Taddeo Gaddi and Fra Angelico. When meeting Dal Médico, a fellow from Pont-Aven, he decided to accompany him to Constantinople via Samos. There, he got the commission to paint the chaple of Les Missionnaires de Lyon. He afterwards moved on to Smyrna, where Maria left him for a French photographer. Via Jerusalem and Alexandria, he arrived in Cairo by the end of the year. There, he had some income from decorating the chapel of the "Pères de la Mission africaine de Lyon," but still was supported by Bonger and de La Rochefouauld.
1894.
Married "Hannénah Saati," of Libanese descent, on July 1 and started living like an Arab, whilst reading Fathers of the Church (St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas) and philosophers like Hegel, Aristotle and Plato, for becoming inspired. Still was, to some extent, supported by his family. To the 5th album of André Marty's L'Estampe originale, he contributed a print.
1895.
Bernard's first son, Otse, was born. The painter was commissioned with frescoes for the chapel of Cairo's Cathédrale de la Vierge and looked for inspiration in Michelangelo's oeuvre. 
His sister Madeleine, terminally ill with tuberculosis, moved to Cairo where she died on November 19.
1896.
For their difficult financial situation, the family moved to Spain, reaching Granada in August and Seville in December. Hannénah became ill of tuberculosis.
1897.
In spring, Bernard met Spanish painter Zuloaga; after the birth of a second son, Fortunato, they moved back to Cairo to live with Hannénah's family. Both sons died of tuberculosis, soon later.
1898.
Birth of a third son, Odilon. Bernard participated at the Salon de l'Art Religieux and published the firstone of 17 volumes of poetry. Besides, he started a major paintings series on life in Cairo.
1899.
In an exhibition in honour of Odilon Redon, organized by de La Rochfoucauld and held at Durand-Ruel gallery, Bernard exhibited a tapestry and a cupboard panel.

Konrad the Curly

Konrad the Curly (; b. ca. 1198 – d. Czerwony Kosciol, 4 September 1213), was a Polish prince member of the Piast dynasty in his Silesian branch. 
He was the third son of Henry I the Bearded, Duke of Wroclaw, by his wife (and later Saint) Hedwig, daughter of Berthold IV, Duke of Merania.
Life.
Little is known about his early years. The death of his older brother Bolesław in 1208 left him in the second place over the Silesian inheritance, after his brother and new heir Henry II the Pious. He died very young after a fall from his horse during a hunt and was buried in Trebnitz, where his sister Gertrude was the Abbess.
Prince Konrad was the hero of the first alleged ethnic conflict between the Polish and Germans in Silesia. According to an anonymous Silesian monk, the author of the "Polish-Silesian Chronicle" from the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, Henry I the Bearded tried to leave all his inheritance to Henry II the Pious. This led in a quarrel between the brothers, who degenerated in an open conflict with the passive attitude of their parents. In this dispute, the young Konrad had the support of the Polish, and Henry II gained the favour of the Germans. As a result, both forces crushed in the Battle of Studnica near Opole in 1213, were the Germans under the leadership of Henry II defeated the Polish troops of Konrad. The chronicles suggests that Konrad's fatal accident shortly after wasn't coincidence. 
Thanks to this information, by the 19th and early 20th century, Prince Konrad became in a Polish national hero. Historiography recognized the Battle of Studnica as a breakthrough event for Polish Silesia. The Silesian writer Jan Mikołaj Jaroń created a 1920 drama with the title "Konrad the Curly". In 1928, Leon Schiller developed the "Silesian Drama at the beginning of the 13th century in five acts". As a defender of the Prince, Zofia Kossak-Szczucka wrote "Legnickie Pole" in 1931. Konrad's brother and antagonist, Henry II the Pious, was recognized as pro-German.

Green Gallery

The Green Gallery was an art gallery that operated between 1960 and 1965 and was located at 15 West 57th Street in Manhattan, New York, United States. The director of the gallery was Richard Bellamy (1927–1998), and it was one of the first "uptown" galleries to show the work of the downtown New York avant-garde. During the late 1950s and early 1960s the downtown New York art world's avant-garde circle was generally located around the 10th Street Galleries and the Green Gallery began to show many "10th Street" artists uptown. Searching for the best kinetic metaphor to describe Richard Bellamy's contribution to his art practice, Green Gallery opening artist Mark di Suvero famously told his dealer of 38 years, "You've been (springboard? (wings?) (slingshot?) to my art." 
The Green Gallery opened in 1960 with backing from the art collector Robert Scull (1917–1986). In 1962, Bellamy was introduced to the 22 year old Sam Green. Amused by the coincidence of their names, Bellamy hired Green on the spot to man the galleries front desk. Art writer John Gruen later described Green Gallery as an ""An important stepping-stone for every major American Pop artist."" The gallery's five-year run spanned a fertile period in the New York art world. Showcasing a new generation of post-Abstract Expressionist artists, diverse in talent and vision, who were giving shape to works that would by the mid-1960s be called Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction, Minimalism, Op Art, Fluxus, and Pop Art.
After Andy Warhol's friend Ted Carey saw the works of James Rosenquist there - when Warhol was without a gallery, and still working as an illustrator - he suggested that Warhol try to engage the owner. In 1963 Warhol befriended Green in the gallery (assuming that Green was the son of the owner named "Green"), looking for an outlet for his artworks.
It displayed the work of such artists as Tom Wesselmann, James Rosenquist, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Dan Flavin, Larry Poons, Milet Andrejevic, Mark di Suvero, Lucas Samaras, Robert Beauchamp, Neil Williams, Philip Wofford, Ralph Humphrey, Ronald Bladen, Richard Smith, Sally Hazelet Drummond, Pat Passlof, and Tadaaki Kuwayama. Other artists who exhibited in group exhibitions there included Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Andy Warhol, Yayoi Kusama, Frank Stella, John Chamberlain, Daniel Spoerri, Walter Darby Bannard, Robert Whitman, Julius Hatofsky, Burgoyne Diller, Myron Stout, Richard Stankiewicz, Lester Johnson, Felix Pasilis, Joan Jacobs, Lilly Brody, Jean Follett, Aristedemos Kaldis, Peter Agostini, Philip Pavia, Franz Kline among others.

Paola filmed two seasons of the show and production was concluded in late 2009. "Atrévete a Soñar" marked Paola's transition from children's to tween telenovelas. Paola and the cast of the telenovela recorded two soundtracks and toured across Mexico, in order to promote the show. The telenovela and its soundtrack were very successful throughout Mexico and Latin America. The soundtrack was certified double platinum in Mexico.
2011–present.
In 2011, she began the production for her fourth solo studio album. Her previous discography included songs for telenovela or film soundtracks. She revealed that she wanted her new album to reflect her growth as an artist and shed her image as a child actress. "Ruleta", written by Mexican pop singer, Paty Cantú, was announced as the album's lead single. The official music video premiered on Paola's official VEVO channel on 14 March 2012. The single rose to number 32 on the Top Mexican Airplay charts in July 2012.
Her self-titled album, "Danna Paola", was released on 5 June 2012, simultaneously in Mexico and Latin America for digital download and physical release. It included 11 songs written by popular Mexican artists such as Jesse y Joy, Río Roma, Ha*Ash, and a collaboration with 3BallMTY. The album debuted at number 56 on AMPROFON. Previously, "Curame" was announced as a single, but on 19 June 2012, the song was replaced by "Todo fue un show" as the album's second single. Paola explained that she decided to change the single choice, in order to showcase her vocal ability. The album's following single, "No Es Cierto", is a duet with Noel Schajris. Her fourth single, "Agüita", is the official theme song for the second season of MTV Latin America's series, "Niñas Mal".
In May 2012, she served as the opening act for Demi Lovato's concerts in at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City and the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.
In May 2013, Paola auditioned for the first Spanish-language Mexican production of the successful Broadway musical, "Wicked", in Mexico City. She auditioned for both Glinda and Elphaba, performing "Popular" and "Defying Gravity". Later that same month, the final cast for the Mexican production was announced, with Paola playing the role of Elphaba. The production opened in Mexico City at Teatro Telcel, on October 17, 2013. Critics in Mexico, as well as the play's original composer, Stephen Schwartz, praised her performance. At the age of 18, Paola is the youngest person to play the role of Elphaba.
In addition to being well-received by critics, the play was also a commercial success in Mexico City. In its first 12 weeks, it sold over 100,000 tickets and had 100 performances, breaking a box office record and making it one of the most successful theatre productions in Mexico. In March 2014, Paola was cast in "Saving Sara Cruz" a modern day remake of the 1992 film, "The Bodyguard". The film will be Paola's English-language debut. Filming for the project reportedly began in June 2014.

Henriette Anne Louise d'Aguesseau

Henriette Anne Louise d'Aguesseau, Duchess of Noailles, Princess of Tingry (12 February 1737 – 22 July 1794), was the heiress of her grandfather, Henri François d'Aguesseau, and wife of Jean Paul François de Noailles, Count and Duke of Ayen.
Family.
She was the daughter of Jean Baptiste Paulin d'Aguesseau de Fresne, Count of Compans and of Maligny, who married, on 29 February 1736, Anne Louise Françoise du Pré, Dame of la Grange-Bleneau, daughter of Louis Francis du Pré, Lord of La Grange-Bleneau, and Anne Louise Robert de Septeuil. 
Her father was successively adviser to the Parliament, Commissioner of the Second Chamber of the Palais Queries, Master of Requests, State Councilor regular in 1734, Dean's Council, and Provost Master of Ceremonies of the Order of the Holy Spirit. Her mother died the day after she was born, on 13 February 1737.
Her paternal grandfather Henri François d'Aguesseau (November 27, 1668 – February 5, 1751) was Chancellor of France three times between 1717 and 1750.
Early life.
Her mother died in childbirth, and after her father remarried, she was educated at the Convent of the Visitation at Saint-Denis, by Mme d'Héricourt. At the age of fourteen, she was educated by her stepmother, Mme d'Aguesseau de Fresnes: 
She preferred reading and gardening--into which latter skill she had been initiated, in the park at Fresnes, by her grandfather the chancellor. His death in 1750 came as a dreadful shock to her. She had adored the courteous and attentive old gentleman. 
After the death of her grandfather, Henri François d'Aguesseau, she became an heiress. She was married to Jean-Paul-François de Noailles on 25 February 1755. The arranged marriage had been worked out by Adrien-Maurice, 3rd duc de Noailles, who had worked with Chancellor d'Aguesseau.
Hôtel de Noailles.
She maintained a salon at the Hôtel de Noailles, the family residence in Paris. She disapproved of the arranged marriage of her daughter Adrienne with Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, in view of their youth. So after a year's delay while she managed their courtship, they were married at the Hôtel de Noailles.
At the death of her father-in-law, Louis, 4th duc de Noailles, she returned to France. In May 1794, during the Reign of Terror, she was arrested at Hôtel de Noailles and imprisoned in Luxembourg Prison (see Prison du Luxembourg) in Paris. Along with her mother-in-law, Catherine de Cossé-Brissac duchesse de Noailles, and daughter, Anne Jeanne Baptiste Louise vicomtesse d'Ayen, she was guillotined, on 22 July 1794. She was buried in a mass grave of Picpus Cemetery.
The Château de la Grange-Bléneau passed from her maternal grandfather, through her, to her daughter, Adrienne de La Fayette.

Law enforcement in the Netherlands

Law enforcement in the Netherlands is provided by the National Police Corps (), divided in ten regional units and a central unit, and the Royal Marechaussee (), a gendarmerie.
Organisation.
From the end of 1945 until 1993, the Dutch police was composed of the "municipal police" () and the "state police" (). In 1994, the police was reorganised into 25 "Regional Constabularies" () and a National Constabulary (). In 2013 the police in the Netherlands was reorganised again into its current structure. In the event of serious emergencies, the police cooperates with the fire brigade, ambulance service, other government agencies and military forces in the security region corresponding to the police region.
The "regiokorpsen".
Every "regiokorps" (regional constabulary) is led by a "korpschef" (corps chief), a "Hoofdcommissaris" (Chief Commissioner) who conducts the day-to-day police force management. Decisions about the principal law enforcement policies are made by a regional board, the so-called "Driehoek" (triangle) whose chairman is the "korpsbeheerder" (force manager). The "korpsbeheerder" is usually the mayor of the largest municipality in the region. The other board members of the "Driehoek" are the "korpschef" and the (chief) prosecutor.
A region consists of several districts, each having a district chief. Each district consists of a number of local units, called "basiseenheden" (basic units) or teams.
The "police strength", the number of constables and other police employees in a region is determined by the number of inhabitants and the amount of crime in the region. So the smallest force counts about 300 police officers, while the largest one counts more than 5000 police employees. There are about 55,000 police employees serving in the Netherlands.
Selected police officers may also be deployed in a riot police Mobile Unit. Mobile units are called in to deal with serious public order offenses. Each police region has one or more units on stand-by for a total of 45 mobile units nationwide, each of which has about 50 members (including middle-ranking and senior officers). Nine units have also been trained to respond to incidents on maritime vessels. The Mobile Unit also incorporates plain clothes units known as 'aanhoudingseenheden'. These groups target specific suspects of public order offenses.
"Korps landelijke politiediensten".
The "Korps landelijke politiediensten" (National Constabulary, KLPD) provides eleven operational services, including:
The KLPD is responsible for policing on the roads, waterways, railways and in the air. It also combats domestic and cross-border serious/organised crime and terrorism. For that last purpose the KLPD has operational command of all anti-terror police units. The national constabulary supports the regional police forces with specialised means such as police horse and dog teams; provides witness protection. A last task is the protection of members of the Dutch Royal Family and other dignitaries (e.g. diplomats and politicians) as assigned by the authorised minister.
"Koninklijke Marechaussee".
The "Koninklijke Marechaussee" (KMar) (Royal Constabulary or Royal Military Police) is one of the four services of the Armed forces of the Netherlands. It is a gendarmerie — that is, a military organisation which conducts the duties of a normal police force as well as being the police force to the armed forces. The Marechaussee is a fully military force under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence. However it does not answer to the Chief of the Defence Staff, but directly to the minister of defence (to secure independence and impartiality when enforcing military law).
The RNLM performs the following duties:
The first four units are territorial, other two have national rather than regional responsibilities. The Marechaussee also provides general policing at Schiphol airport and its surrounding area -known as 'Schiphol-Rijk', in addition to border control duty at the airport itself.
The Marechaussee also carries ceremonial duties at royal palaces, such as when new diplomats present their Letters of Credence to the Queen, and to escort important guests.
Military tasks are to guard military (including NATO) bases, to provide police service to military personnel, to assist military transports and civil and military law enforcement.
A last duty is to reinforce and support the civil police when extra manpower or a higher escalation in the use of force is needed. To this end the KMar has its own Riot units; its own teams to make arrests and the BSB (see above). The KMar has some armoured car units to perform such duties.
KMar subunits usually accompany units of the Armed forces of the Netherlands on deployment and they are especially well represented in the Police Training mission in the Afghan Kunduz province where they lead the training of the ANP. 
Ranks.
Ranks of the Dutch police.
Within the Dutch police the following ranks are in use:
Police trainees are armed with a handgun if training for the constable level, if not the trainee performs his/hers duties unarmed (pepperspray,handcuffs and baton).
In addition to these ranks, the so-called "Buitengewoon Opsporings Ambtenaren" (Special Investigation Officials) serve in the force. These are usually not a part of the above rank system. These special investigation officials may be authorised for specific duties such as parking duties or railway duties. Often it means they are authorised to uphold specific laws by fining transgressors, without the use of weapons or any other use of force.
Ranks of the Royal Marechaussee.
The ranks within the Royal Marechaussee are:
General Officers, National Level:
Senior officers, District Level:
Officers, Brigade Level:
Executive personnel:
Equipment.
Basically the equipment of every Dutch police officer consists of the following:
Personnel from the rank of Constable ("Agent") and also some trainees ("Aspirant") carry a firearm. 
The German-made Walther P5 is currently in use for the Dutch police and has been since 1978 while arrestatieteams (SWAT) is armed with the Austrian-made Glock 17 pistol and/or a submachine gun, usually the German-made Heckler & Koch MP5.
It was originally planned to be replaced by the SIG-SAUER PPNL, a 9x19mm Parabellum version of the SIG Sauer P250, but the contract was canceled due to the failure of several safety tests.
Tasks.
Since 2012, the new Dutch Police Law (Politiewet 2012) passed. The article which describes the police, has been changed from article 2, to article 3.
Article 3 of the Dutch Police law describes what the missions of the police are: "The task of the police is to, in subordination to the authorities and complying with applicable law, take care of the actual upholding of the legal order and to supply aid to those who need it." In practice this is comes down to four main missions.
Within the police, several departments are occupied with parts of these main tasks.
Communications centre.
The communications centre is sometimes called the heart of the police force. All calls to the emergency telephone number 112 and the national police number 0900-8844 come in here around the clock.
The people of the communications centre have to judge the calls in such a way that something is done, fast and properly. If a call is serious, an employee in the communications centre will have to directly choose which police officers are to be dispatched to the address. The communications centre employees know exactly where all the members of the force on the street are.
The calls coming into the communications centre are dispatched according to a number of criteria, resulting in so called priorities. Four priorities are defined.
The other two priorities are dispatched to neighbourhood teams.
Systems in use.
For a number of years, the communications centres have used the "Gemeenschappelijk Meldkamer Systeem" (Common Communications Centre System, GMS). This system has a lot of functions. In the first place it functions as a plotting screen which displays every unit logged in. It also has a database function for procedures and phone numbers necessary for correctly executing police work and it links to the C2000 system and the CityGIS (GPS) system.
C2000 is the digital, secure communications system and, with CityGIS, police cars can be tracked on a map using GPS, which can be reported to the communications centre using a VDO navigation system.
Basic police work.
In the Netherlands basic police work consists of the following tasks:
The Dutch government is keen to put more and more police "on the street". This means that the use of ICT will have to be improved so that constables do not lose a lot of time noting all their observations on paper for later use. The uniformed policemen on the street are those of the patrol service.
Sometimes police patrols drive directly from the communications centre to the location where someone requested assistance. This can be a simple case of someone locking their keys inside their car, a complaint about litter or an incoveniently parked car. There are also more serious calls that need direct attention, like an accident with injuries, a stabbing, a burglary, vandalism; all events where the police has to act and reassure.
Surveillance is not only done from the patrol car, but also from a motorbike or a horse. Especially in crowded malls surveillance is often done on foot or (motor)bike. The men and women on the street have to permanently "keep their eyes open" to spot suspicious behaviour, such as someone walking around looking inside parked cars, cars without working lights or drunken cyclists.
Car owners are told that their lights are broken and why this is dangerous. A constable on foot may tell shop owners to put locks on their shelves outside to prevent shoplifting. If you report on a stolen bike, you'll be told what kind of bike locks are most effective.
The police in a municipality are available 24 hours every day for basic law enforcement. More and more often the police will visit schools to teach pupils about drug prevention, vandalism or sex on the internet. The police in a municipality make sure that what is forbidden isn't done, and that which is mandatory is actually done. They also make sure that anyone who asks for assistance gets it, supported by personnel from the district and the region. Since the early 90s several police regions have been working with neighbourhood teams called neighbourhood supervisors.
Powers.
The police have powers "ordinary" people don't have. E.g. an officer can stop or arrest people, or look in a shopping bag for lifted items, or (on authorization of the assistant prosecutor) search a home for arms. The police also have the power to use force. This power is often called the "monopoly on force". The police is one of the few organisations in the Netherlands that are allowed to use force, the use of which is bound by many rules and preconditions.
The power to stop someone is often confused with the power to arrest someone. The power to stop someone is the power of the police to make someone stand still, so that the police can ask for his name and address.
The power to stop someone is the power that enables the arrest of someone. However, this power is not only granted to the police. The Code of Criminal Procedure, article 53, sub 1, reads:
In case of discovery in the act everyone is authorized to stop the suspect.
The term "in the act" meaning "when it just happened".
Stopping someone means holding the suspect while waiting for the arrival of the police. When someone is stopped, he is always brought to a police station for questioning.
The investigative powers of the police are for example described in the Police Law, the Arms and Munitions Law, the Opium Law, the Road Traffic Law 1994, the Entry Law and the Code of Criminal Procedure.
These powers are bound by very strict rules. Some of these powers may be applied by an officer himself, like the examples before. Other police powers, like wiretapping, observation or searching premises, can only be used after permission is granted by the examining judge.
Cooperation with other services.
When providing aid the police cooperates with other services. When dealing with an accident for example, the police cooperates with ambulance services, doctors and the fire brigade. The police also cooperate with the Koninklijke Marechaussee.
"Slachtofferhulp".
For providing support to victims the police cooperates with the "Bureaus Slachtofferhulp" (comparable to Victim Support). The employees of "Slachtofferhulp" are specially trained to provide support to victims of accidents and crime.

Clearance cairn

A Clearance Cairn is an irregular and unstructured collection of fieldstones which have been removed from arable land or pasture to allow for more effective agriculture and collected into a usually low mound or cairn. Commonly of Bronze Age origins, these cairns may be part of a cairnfield (a collection of closely spaced cairns) where some cairns might be funerary. Clearance cairns are a worldwide phenomenon wherever organised agriculture has been practised.
Purpose of clearance.
By removing large and moderate size stones from the surface and sub-surface, ploughing can take place with much less potential damage taking place to the plough blade. Stones also prevent the growth of plants where they physically block access to the soil and their removal allows for a greater surface area for crops to grow and to allow for plants to grow to their full potential; Stones also increase drainage and may therefore deprive plants of moisture. Stones were removed from fields to allow for the efficient use of hand tools, animal powered machines on such fields in the past and for tractors, etc. in more recent times. Some prehistoric clearance cairns may also contain burials. A few clearance cairns may have been additionally created as boundary markers. As ploughing developed and specialised the greater depth tilled and the increased power of mechanised ploughing resulted in more and larger stones being brought to the surface and these too had to be removed.
Field clearance cairns sometimes survive long after cleared fields have fallen out of use and are often the only surviving evidence of past agricultural activity in areas of woodland, upland areas, etc. The existence of these cairns was once regarded as suggesting pastoral farming, many now consider them the result of arable or mixed agricultural exploitation enabling ploughing or hand tillage to work more efficiently.
Heat radiation.
The possibility exists that the stone piles were built in the middle of the enclosures, with an additional purpose of maximising the effects of daytime radiance; the holding in of heat caught during the day, and its release at night would increase the temperature of the field very slightly. This effect would encourage crop growth and reduce the risk of frost. Walled gardens produce the same effect.
Creation of clearance cairns.
Many clearance stones were used in the construction of defensive structures, houses, farm buildings, walls, drainage ditches, road metalling, etc. Where permanent clearance cairns were formed it was predominately on waste land, such as steep slopes, edges of woodland, field corners, and around earth-fast boulders.
The amount of stone which needed to be cleared from fields depended upon the local geology, glacial deposits, glacial erratics, etc. Many cairns are mainly composed of stones which could have been carried by a single person who would have followed the plough as it turned up small boulders, etc.
Some surviving cairns are of considerable antiquity as field clearance has been practised since the beginnings of agriculture in the Stone Age, such as at the Gardberg site in Vestre Slidre, Oppland, Norway. A Bronze Age origin for clearance cairns is more common.
Characteristics.
Cairns may be discreet, in large groups (cairnfields) or as linear formations—linear cairns. Many stones in clearance cairns show plough-marks or ard-marks at various angles to each other, typical of the Bronze Age ploughing methods. These ard-marks indicate that the boulders were obstructing the ploughing process and were in situ for some time before removal.
Other items such as bog-wood and grubbed out tree stumps were sometimes added to the cairns as a result of tree felling and the process of creation of pasture from woodland. Bog-wood stumps and trunks can be thousands of years old, are darker in colour due to the tannins from the peat and do not show typical wood decomposition characteristics due to their preservation within peat bogs. The absence of saw marks indicates felling using axes, providing further information about the age of the wood involved.
Some clearance cairns are linear in form. Many of the smaller cairns were probably created by family groups, whilst larger ones would have required organised labour.
Cairnfields have on occasions been confused with various other classes of monuments, such as round barrow cemeteries and groups of round barrows, stone hut circles, ring cairns, or burnt mounds. In general round barrows are larger, more regular, and may contain visible traces of a cist or kerb; stone hut circles have distinct entrances; ring cairns have a hollow centre; and burnt mounds contain a high proportion of fire-crazed stones of rather smaller size than appear in the average clearance cairns within cairnfields.
Natural deposits such as so called 'clitter agglomerates', morains can also on occasion look rather similar to groups of clearance cairns, but their context, position and regular form usually betrays their true origins.
Clearance cairn material is often heterogeneous, typically consisting of both edged and rounded small stones, sometimes mixed with sand, clay or silt, lifted from the field nearby. Agricultural and clearance cairns are sometimes located on slopes, whilst burial cairns rarely are. 
Clearance cairns constructed using mechanised methods with horse or motor powered assistance may appear superficially similar, however the stones are generally much larger and they are more randomly tipped rather than hand placed. 
Natural history.
Due to the age and 'abandoned' state of many clearance cairns they are often good sites for the growth and survival of lichens, mosses, ferns and other plants; the actual species being dependent on the rock type. Cairns are relatively undisturbed and emulate old walls for the micro-habitats they produce.
Landscape history.
In some areas which are now unproductive moorland, aerial photographs show the presence of numerous prehistoric clearance cairns and associated dwellings such as hut-circles. This clear evidence of previous ancient habitation and cultivation shows that the climate worsened until the farmers were forced to move to lower ground.
Stone carrying.
Stone carry or the stone walk is a traditional Scottish athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition; the competitors pick up two heavy stones with iron handles, and carry the pair as far as they can.

Notebook Found in a Deserted House

"Notebook Found in a Deserted House" is a Cthulhu Mythos short story by Robert Bloch. It was first published in a 1951 issue of Weird Tales. Many consider it to be a predecessor to the film "The Blair Witch Project".
Synopsis.
As the title implies, the entire text is that of a notebook found in an empty house. The notebook is written by Willie Osborne, a farm boy who had lived with his grandmother until she died.
During the time he lived with his grandmother, she told him about entities she called "them ones", which apparently live in the mysterious forest around the farm that his Aunt Lucy and Uncle Fred own. “Them ones” seem to be most active during Halloween, as Willie’s grandmother claims people have heard the sound of drums coming from the forest at that time.
After his grandmother’s death, Willie goes to live with his aunt and uncle who live in the purportedly haunted woods. His ideas about strange beings inhabiting the forest are supported by the fact that his aunt and uncle always lock the doors at night and never enter the woods after dark. Even more strangely, the forest seems to be devoid of animal life. Willie thinks the answer is that a cult of Druids, possibly having come over from before the time of Columbus, lives in the woods.
In October, Willie has a disquieting experience in the forest. Getting late in the day, he hears something coming towards him. Hiding behind a rock, Willie smells an awful stench and hears an unearthly voice say something in an equally unearthly language, in which is the word "shoggoth". Willie investigates the spot where the entity went by and discovers what appear to be hundreds of hoof marks and a foul-smelling slime, not unlike that which comes out of a mysterious old well on the farm. For many nights after, he dreams of the creature that made the hoof-prints.
Things take a turn for the worse as Halloween nears. Willie’s cousin, Frank, was supposed to come visit for Halloween. When the buggy that Fred went out in to bring him to the farm comes back empty, Lucy faints. A few days later, on Halloween, Lucy disappears herself.
When Willie tries to escape, the situation is compounded when a man claiming to be Cousin Osborne shows up, saying that he did not arrive earlier due to business. Willie explains to him the situation, wisely leaving out his experience in the woods and his idea of what might be out there. When Osborne shows knowledge of Willie’s experience anyway, and claims to be from Arkham when Willie knows him to be from Kingsport, it becomes obvious that he is an impostor. Cousin Osborne, claiming to have custody of Willie, orders him to stay indoors. Later, when the mailman, Cap Pritchett, arrives, the fake Osborne insists that Willie is not home. Willie immediately shows himself and asks to be ridden into town. Pritchett, seeing that Cousin Osborne was lying about Willie’s presence, agrees to Willie’s request. Cousin Osborne warns Willie as he leaves that he is making a mistake.
As Pritchett and Willie go some way, Willie tells him about the recent going-ons and asks Pritchett if he knows what a shoggoth is. When Pritchett tries to answer, a black, log-like creature appears in the road and attacks the horse, pulling Pritchett out as he identifies it as a shoggoth. Willie escapes and comes to a clearing where he sees a cult of people he presumes to be the Druids sacrificing cattle, as well as some people, on an enormous rock with two enormous black marks on its sides. The shoggoth reappears, the same from Willie's nightmares. More terrified than ever, Willie runs away, screaming, and ends up back at the house. He barricades himself inside and writes most of the titular notebook.
The next day, Willie sees Cousin Osborne talking to someone, speaking of getting into the house through an unused well in the backyard, which Willie realizes is an entrance to the underground world where the "Druids" live. The last thing he writes is "The door is banging o–"
Chaosium.
The log-like creatures in Bloch's story were identified as shoggoths. Gaming company Chaosium, the creators and publishers of the "Call of Cthulhu" horror role-playing game, which is based on the works of Lovecraft and other Mythos authors, used the creatures in the "Call of Cthulhu" bestiary as depicted by Bloch, but identified them as progenies of Shub-Niggurath (so-called Dark Young) in order to add more monsters to its gaming lines.

Axel Music

Axel Music is an entertainment retail chain based in Denmark, with warehouses and distribution centres in Canada, United States, France, and Germany. It also maintains online websites for customers worldwide. On 18 June 2012, the company announced its bankruptcy.
History.
Axel Music was formed in 1992 in downtown Copenhagen and over the intervening years opened 14 stores in Denmark. In February 2001 the company formed Lake Shore Distribution in Canada and launched Axelmusic.com. In April 2006 it was one of the first online stores to offer HD DVD, followed by Blu-ray in June of that year. As of 2009 it operates a network of warehouses to fulfill orders taken on its internet sites and 8 separate locations throughout Denmark for its Danish customers.
Since June 18, 2012, PlanetAxel is bankrupt.
It is with great sadness, deep regret and utter embarrassment that we announce the closure and bankruptcy of PlanetAxel.com
On Monday afternoon, June 18, 2012 the board of directors have informed us that no further investment will be made in the company. This comes in light of the recently finished 2011 financials which showed such an insurmountable deficit and loss to company value that a swift decision was made almost overnight.
Trivia.
The company maintains separate sites for its customers inside and outside Denmark.
On the international site the customer has the option for viewing the price of an item in Euros, US Dollars, Canadian Dollar, Norwegian Kroner, Swedish Krona, Australian Dollar, Swiss Franc and British Pounds.
One interesting feature of the international site is that, once signed in, the customer can, in the case of Blu-ray Discs, elect to be emailed as to whether or not US sourced versions of films have been found to be region free. Axel Music staff test each US disc to see if it has been region coded and then show on the film's item page that non-US customers can order this title.

Mieszko, Duke of Lubusz

Mieszko of Lubusz () (ca. 1223/27 – 1242) was a Piast Duke of Lubusz during 1241–1242. He was the second son of the Silesian duke Henry II the Pious of Wrocław, by his wife Anne Přemysl, daughter of King Ottokar I of Bohemia.
Life.
When on 9 April 1241 Duke Henry II was defeated and killed in the Mongol invasion of Poland at the Battle of Legnica, Mieszko and his older brother Bolesław II the Bald were old enough to be considered adults according to the Piast family customs. As the chroniclers of the reign of Henry II the Pious called Mieszko with the surname "of Lubusz" ("Lubuski"), it seems possible that his older brother Bolesław II had to cede him their father's territories in Greater Poland around Lebus as a separate district.
This, of course, was to be only temporary until their younger brothers Henry III the White and Konrad I attained the age of majority. However Mieszko wasn't alive to see this, because was dead by the beginning of 1242 and was buried in St. Peter's Church below the Lubusz Castle. He never married or had children. Shortly after, Lubusz was pledged to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and the Margraviate of Brandenburg by his brother Bolesław II.

Irving Sandler

Irving Sandler (born July 22, 1925 in New York City) is an American art critic, art historian, and educator. He has provided numerous first hand accounts of American art, beginning with abstract expressionismin the 1950s, where he managed the Tanager Gallerydowntown and co-ordinated the New York artists' ZT 'Club' of the New York School from 1955 to its demise in 1962 as well as documenting numerous conversations of from the Cedar Street Tavern and other artists venues. Sandler saw himself as an impartial observer of this period, as opposed to polemical advocates such as Clement Greenberg or Harold Rosenberg.
Biography.
Sandler was raised in Philadelphia. He served with the U.S. Marine Corps for three years in the Second World War. He received a bachelor's degree from Temple University in 1948, and a master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1950. He did some additional graduate work at Columbia University, but ultimately finished a doctoral degree at New York University much later, in 1976. He started writing art criticism at the behest of Thomas B. Hess for "ARTNews" in 1956, and was a senior critic there through 1962. He has taught at several universities, including the Pratt Institute, New York University, and the State University of New York at Purchase, where he was appointed a professor in 1972.
Sandler has curated several critically acclaimed exhibitions including the "Concrete Expressionism Show" in 1965 at New York University, which featured the work of painters Al Held and Knox Martin and the sculptors Ronald Bladen, George Sugarman and David Weinrib, and "The Prospect Mountain Sculpture Show" in 1977. Many American artists have been interviewed by Sandler, including first generation abstract expressionists such as Robert Motherwell, Willem DeKooning, Phillip Guston, and Franz Kline. in 1957 and later pop protagonists such as Tom Wesselmann in 1984. In the 1970s he was co-founder of "Artists Space", that helped launch the careers of Judy Pfaff, Barbara Kruger and Cindy Sherman amongst others.
As indicated in the bibliography below, Sandler has written several monographs on individual artists as well as a sweeping, four-volume survey of "postmodern art" ("The Triumph of American Painting: A History of Abstract Expressionism" (1970), "The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties" (1978), "American Art of the 1960s" (1988), and "Art of the Postmodern Era: From the Late 1960s to the Early 1990s" (1996).). Robert Storr has described the history, "Narrative, untheoretical--at times antitheoretical--and unapologetically focused not just on what happened in the United States but principally on what happened in Manhattan, Sandler's surveys have been widely criticized but even more widely used, not least because they are readable and deeply informed by their author's unrivaled access to the artists and art-worldings about whom he writes." Sandler continues to write, and is concerned with allowing certain aspects of New York painting to be reassessed, as in his recent work on Esteban Vicente (2007). In 2009 he published "Abstract Expressionism and the American Experience: a Reevaluation".

Liverpool 1 is a British television drama series centred on the work of a fictional Merseyside Police vice squad. Produced by Lime Street Productions for ITV, it starred Samantha Janus and Mark Womack and ran for two series in 1998 and 1999. The series represented an early vehicle for Janus' move into mainstream drama roles, following her success in the situation comedy "Game On".
Plot.
"Liverpool 1" focused on Detective Constable Isobel De Pauli (Samantha Janus), a successful Metropolitan Police detective. Her partner's career move to Liverpool in turn sees De Pauli transferred there. Upon arrival she is partnered with introverted DC Mark Callaghan (Mark Womack), a no-nonsense officer brought up on the streets of the city he now polices; the opening sequence of the first episode culminates in Callaghan throwing a suspect from an apartment window.
The earlier episodes centre around the dual themes of the personality clash between De Pauli and Callaghan, coupled with the ongoing saga of the squad's pursuit of local gangster John Sullivan (played by Paul Usher). Callaghan's relationship with Sullivan - who is his cousin - and the interconnectedness of the city, are themes throughout the series.
Episodes featured guest stars including Leslie Phillips.
Repeats are intermittently shown on ITV3.
Janus and Womack began a relationship during the filming of the series; they have since had two children, Benjamin (born 2001) and Lily-Rose (born 2005) and on 17 May 2009, the pair were married.

Gaius Crastinus

Gaius Crastinus (c. 85 BC – 48 BC) was a soldier in Julius Caesar's 10th legion during his Gallic Wars. He had first joined either the 8th or 9th legion in 65 BC, when Pompey Magnus had first raised these two legions in Spain. He transferred over to the 10th legion as a junior-grade centurion in 61 BC when it was first formed, after being handpicked by Caesar. After joining the 10th legion, he commanded a Century. Crastinus fought throughout Caesar's Gallic campaigns, and was present at the Battle of Alesia, where he witnessed the surrender of the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix to the forces of the Roman Republic. Early in the war, Crastinus commanded his unit as it repelled an attempted crossing of a river by the Helvetii. Crastinus, whom Caesar considered to be amongst his best soldiers, was promoted by Caesar to the rank of Primus Pilus, or "First Spear" Centurion. This rank was one of exceptional prestige, since centurions of this rank commanded the first ("primus"), and most important, century in a Legion. With this rank, Crastinus also would have outranked all other centurions in his legion, as it was the highest possible rank of any enlisted Roman soldier. 
He died in the battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, playing a vital role as he led a forlorn hope party of volunteers in the opening attack against Pompey's line from Caesar's right wing. As reported by Caesar in the De Bello Civili he incited his comrades saying "Follow me, my old comrades, and give your general true service. Only this battle remains; when it's over he will regain his dignity and we our freedom." Then he turned to Caesar and said "Today, general, I shall earn your gratitude whether I live or die". He almost broke through the enemy line before being killed by an enemy legionary thrusting a gladius in his mouth. Appianus reports that after the battle Caesar himself said to be in Crastinus' debt, tributed him heroic rites and erecting an altar. 
Ross Cowan in his monograph "Roman Battle Tactics 109 BC – AD 313" advances the hypothesis that Crastinus offered himself as sacrifice to the Underworld Gods to ensure Caesar victory in a "Devotio". In this rite, a Roman soldier offered to die in battle and pledged his soul to the Gods of underworld to ensure in exchange the destruction of the enemy. The Italian historian Luciano Canfora in his book "Giulio Cesare. Il dittatore democratico" likens the figure of Crastinus as that of a political commissar, totally devoted to the Caesarian party to the point of volunteering for a suicide mission.

Division polynomials

In mathematics the division polynomials provide a way to calculate multiples of points on elliptic curves and to study the fields generated by torsion points. They play a central role in the study of counting points on elliptic curves in Schoof's algorithm.
Definition.
The set of division polynomials is a sequence of polynomials in formula_1 with formula_2 free variables that is recursively defined by:
The polynomial formula_11 is called the "n"th division polynomial.
Properties.
Using the relation between formula_39 and formula_40, along with the equation of the curve, the functions formula_41 , formula_42 and formula_35 are all in formula_17.
Let formula_45 be prime and let formula_31 be an elliptic curve over the finite field formula_47, i.e., formula_48. The formula_49-torsion group of formula_15 over formula_51 is isomorphic to formula_52 if formula_53, and to formula_54 or formula_55 if formula_56. Hence the degree of formula_57 is equal to either formula_58, formula_59, or 0.
René Schoof observed that working modulo the formula_49"th" division polynomial allows one to work with all formula_49-torsion points simultaneously. This is heavily used in Schoof's algorithm for counting points on elliptic curves.

St. Andrew's Episcopal Church (Walden, New York)

St. Andrew's Episcopal Church is located at the corner of Walnut and Orchard Street in the village of Walden, New York, United States. It is a brick Gothic Revival structure designed and built in 1871 by Charles Babcock, a former partner of Richard Upjohn. Located at the center of town, near the village hall, it is a local landmark that dominates the village's skyline.
Babcock, who was himself an Episcopal priest, designed the building with the Ecclesiological theories of Anglican church architecture in mind. It has been renovated slightly since its construction, and joined to a nearby chapel, but remains largely intact, exemplifying those theories. In 2008 the church and its rectory were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Property.
The property includes two contributing resources, the church and its rectory. A chapel that was originally freestanding has been connected to the church.
Church.
The church's main facade faces east, towards the triangle of Orchard, Scofield and Walnut streets at the center of town. Opposite is the village's memorial to the local members of the 124th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the "Orange Blossoms", who served with distinction in the Union Army during the Civil War. The village hall is located diagonally across from it on Walnut Street.
It is a single-story brick structure with a steeply-pitched gabled roof. On the southeast side of the nave, near the front entrance, is a bell tower with a tall spire. It and the church's main roof are shingled in slate. The walls are reddish-brown brick laid in common bond. The foundation is of locally-quarried brownstone, with a datestone in the southeast corner.
Three narrow Gothic lancet windows resting on a brownstone course are evenly spaced across the front, with a roundel high above. The roofline is marked by a corbelled cornice with a metal Latin cross at the gable's apex. The main entrance, at the foot of the bell tower, has double wooden doors, each with a St. Andrew's cross in the lower corner, set in a Gothic arch surrounded with three brick courses. A louvered, recessed Gothic arch marks the bell stage of the tower, which then gives way after brief corbels to the spire, topped with another cross.
The four-bay south face, looking out on Orchard Street, has a pair of lancet windows, similar to but smaller than their counterparts on the front. It is broken by the chapel transept, where another lancet window was once bricked over. To the west of the transept is the connection to the chapel. On the north side are an identical grouping of windows and a porch which provides direct access to the nave. A tall brick chimney rises from the wall here.
Inside, the sanctuary has the pews arranged with a center aisle and two side ones along the walls. The ceiling is made of beaded wooden boards that expose the hammerbeam roof's trusses. Chamfered wooden posts rise up to it from between the lancet window pairs on either side. A carved wooden altar with Gothic motifs sits in front of the lancet windows in the west wall. In the rear are an office and robing room.
The basement is largely unfinished and used for storage. Support functions, such as a kitchen and meeting space, are handled by the rooms of the former chapel.
Rectory.
The rectory, an L-shaped two-and-a-half-story brick house, is located just north of the church along Walnut Street. The three-bay front facade extends east from the larger main block in the rear. It features segmented arched windows with brownstone sills and a wooden porch. The foundation is brownstone.
Its finishes inside date from the original construction and later renovations. Of note from the latter are the front staircase and architrave between the front and rear parlors.
Aesthetics.
Like Upjohn and other Episcopal architects designing churches for that faith in the mid-19th century, Babcock was strongly influenced by articles and essays in "The Ecclesiologist", a journal published by members of England's Oxford Movement, which sought a return to more traditional religious practices in Anglicanism. In architecture that meant the older forms of the English country parish church, many built during the Middle Ages, such as St Michael's Church, Longstanton, which has a similar main block to St. Andrew's.
Babcock's initials are found on many sketches of Upjohn's, including one church with tower in Upjohn's pattern book "Rural Architecture" that strongly resembles St. Andrew's. Christ Church in Ballston Spa, completed by Upjohn's office after he left, also bears a resemblance, although its massing and decoration are less restrained than Babcock typically was.
For St. Andrew's, he offset the tower to the side, a variation that had become popular with Ecclesiological architects around the mid-19th century. This created a more Picturesque effect than leaving it in the center. Because of this, and the limitations of the lot, the church's chancel is on the west end rather than liturgical east as most "Ecclesiologist"-influenced churches do.
The rectory, completed slightly after the main church, shows more vernacular influences of its day, and those of later renovations. Its main design is Italianate, but the current porch, rebuilt in the early 20th century, is a Craftsman-style treatment of the original.
History.
The St. Andrew's congregation predates its current church building by a century. It was one of three charters in the region obtained in July 1770 by The Rev. John Sayre, sent as a missionary to the Hudson Valley from London. After the Revolution, it shared its rector with St. George's in nearby Newburgh.
Congregants had moved from a primitive log cabin to a more permanent meetinghouse as the church grew, and in 1826 they decided to build a larger one in Walden, at the time an unincorporated preindustrial hamlet known mainly for its mill on the Wallkill River. It was finished and consecrated in September 1827.
After the Civil War, the church needed to expand again. It bought the current lot in 1871 from William Scofield, after whom a nearby street is named, for $800 ($ in 2009 dollars). Babcock, at the time transitioning from his position as rector of St. James' Church in Arden to the first professor at what is now Cornell University's College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, delivered plans and construction documents before leaving for Ithaca. Local contractors using local materials were hired, and the church was finished later that year. The debt incurred by the construction was enough that it took until 1880 to pay off, and only then was the church formally consecrated.
The rectory was built the following year. In 1884 the congregation decided to accommodate continuing growth by building the chapel on the western end of the lot. At the turn of the century the oil lamps that had originally lit the church's sanctuary were replaced with electric models, and in 1915 the rectory received its remodeled porch and some changes to the interior, such as the rear parlor fireplace.
Eventually the congregation decided to combine the chapel and church into one large building. This began in 1924 with a simple hyphen, and culminated 15 years later with the current linkage and its accompanying changes to the chapel's fenestration. The church and rectory have remained intact since that time.

Harold Morris (politician)

Family and education.
Harold Morris was the son of Sir Malcolm Morris, KCVO, the eminent surgeon and dermatologist. He was educated at Clifton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. Morris married Olga Teichman of Chislehurst, Kent and they had one son and four daughters.
Career.
Morris graduated in law from Oxford. He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple in 1899 and joined the South-East Circuit. Between 1914–1919 he served the Coldstream Guards, including two and half years service in France was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the military MBE. He took silk in 1921 and was the same year appointed Recorder of Folkestone, serving until 1926. From 1926–1945 he served as President of the Industrial Court and from 1925 he was Chairman of the National Wages Board for Railways. He was knighted in 1927.
In 1929, Morris was appointed Chairman of the Committee on Unemployment Claims and from 1930–1935 he was Chairman of the Coal Wages Board. In the 1940s he was elected a member of the Royal Institution. In 1944 he was Chairman of the Court of Inquiry set up by the Minister of Labour and National Service to look into the wages and hours of work obtaining in the woolcombing section of the wool textile industry in Yorkshire. He retired from legal work in 1945, aged 70 but maintained directorships of a number of companies.
Peel Commission.
In 1936, Morris was appointed as a member of the Palestine Royal Commission, or the Peel Commission, which was set up to look into the disturbances between the Arab and Jewish populations of the British Mandated Territory of Palestine. The Commission recommended that there should be a Jewish national state in north and west of Palestine and an Arab state in the east and south. However the government rejected the Commission’s proposal to partition Palestine.
Politics.
At the 1922 general election, Morris was selected as the Lloyd George National Liberal candidate for Bristol East. Bristol East had been a Liberal seat since its creation in 1885 and had been held by Sir Charles Hobhouse. It was fought and won in 1918 by George Bryant Britton as a Coalition Liberal in opposition to Hobhouse who remained an Independent Asquithian. However Britton did not wish to stand again in 1922 and Morris was chosen to replace him. He faced a straight fight with Labour and just held the seat with a majority of 151 votes. At the 1923 general election Morris was again involved in a straight fight against Labour. Despite the surge in support for the re-united Liberal Party at this election nationally, Morris was unable to hold onto his seat, losing to Labour’s Walter John Baker by 2,040 votes. After this election Morris decided to concentrate on his legal career and did not stand for Parliament again.
Death.
Morris died at his home at 21 Lichfield Road, Kew, in Surrey, on 11 November 1967 aged 90.

Bernard the Lightsome

Bernard the Lightsome (also known as of Lwówek) () (ca. 1253/57 – 25 April 1286) was a Duke of Lwówek (Löwenberg) since 1278 (with his brother until 1281) and Jawor (Jauer) during 1278–1281 (as a co-ruler of his brother).
He was the third son of Bolesław II the Bald, Duke of Legnica by his first wife Hedwig, daughter of Henry I, Count of Anhalt. It is not known when exactly he was born but had to happen before 1258, because seven years later he was sent to Wroclaw by his father with the "Tithe" to the Bishop Thomas.
Life.
Bernard actively supported the policy of his father Bolesław II and his brothers, Henry V the Fat and Bolko I the Strict (for example, he participated in the victorious Battle of Stolec). After the death of his father in 1278, Henry V give his younger brothers Bernard and Bolko I the Duchies of Lwówek ("Löwenberg") and Jawor as a co-rulers. However, his independent rule began only three years later, in 1281, when he and Bolko made the division of their domains and Bernard received Lwówek. Little is known about this period in Bernard's life, and the only certain fact was (according to the chronicles), that he promoted and protect knights, a common practice among the medieval princes. This also maybe justificated his nickname "Zwinny" (Lightsome, Clever) give to him by contemporarie sources. Lwówek had a special gratitude to him after he kept the Silesian monastery of the Knights Hospitaller, where he was a generous benefactor, giving them among other things in 1281, the village of Cieplice.
Bernard died unmarried and childless in 1286. He was buried in the Dominican church in Legnica, and his lands were inherited by his brother Bolko.

Treshchotka

Treshchotka (, singular; sometimes referred as Treshchotki, , plural) is a Russian folk music idiophone instrument which is used to imitate hand clapping.
Treshchotka (Clapper).
Traditional Russian idiophone percussion instrument Treshchotka is a set of small boards on a string that get clapped together as a group 
Treshchotki is commonly used in Russian folk music.
Name.
The word is derived from the root "tresk-", meaning crackling or rattle. In Russian slang, word Treshchotka "()" sometimes used to describe a person who is excessively chatty and loud.
History.
There are no known documents confirming usage of Treshchotka in ancient Russia; however in 1992, during an archeological dig the city of Novgorod, two wooden boards were found; which, by the hypothesis of Vladimir Ivanovich Povetkin, were parts of the ancient Novgorod's treshchotka of the 12th century. 
The first published mention of Treshchotka was made by Kliment Vasilievich Kvitka. The great Russian lexicographer Vladimir Dahl describes treshchotka in his "Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language" as a device made to produce crackling, thundering and racketing sounds. 
At the present time some villages in Russia are still playing and crafting treshchotkas.
Construction.
Treshchotka is made of a set of 15 to 20 thin oak planks/boards which are about 16 to 18 centimeters (approximately 6-8 inches) long; planks are tightly held by a rope that is threaded through the hole on top of each board. To make sure that boards are not pressed against each other a small short piece of wood (2 cm 1.5 inches) is inserted between each board.
Play.
To play treshchotka one would hold it by the ends with both hands, generally at the chest or head high and alternate the motion between brusque and smooth to produce crackling and clicking sounds. This technique not only attracts listener by its sounds but also adds visual spectacle effect.
Superstitions.
It is noted that treshchotkas was used during peasant wedding ceremonies where instrument(s) could have been decorated with ribbons, flowers and sometimes jingle bells. The use of the treshchotka in the wedding ceremonies allows to theorize that in the past it were performing not only a role of musical instrument but also served some mystical function, perhaps protecting newlyweds from evil spirits.

Instrument of Government

The Instrument of Government was a constitution of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. Drafted by Major-General John Lambert in 1653, it was the first sovereign codified and written constitution in the English-speaking world.
Antecedence.
The "Instrument of Government" included elements incorporated from an earlier document "Heads of Proposals, which had been agreed to by the Army Council in 1647, as set of propositions intended to be a basis for a constitutional settlement after King Charles I was defeated in the First English Civil War. Charles had rejected the propositions, but before the start of the Second Civil War, the Grandees of the New Model Army had presented the "Heads of Proposals" as their alternative to the more radical Agreement of the People presented by the Agitators and their civilian supporters at the Putney Debates.
On 4 January 1649 the Rump Parliament declared "that the people are, under God, the original of all just power; that the Commons of England, being chosen by and representing the people, have the supreme power in this nation". This was used to as the basis for the House of Commons to pass acts of parliament which did not have be to passed by the House of Lords or receive royal assent. Two days later the Rump alone passed the act creating the high court of justice that would try Charles as a traitor. Charles was tried and executed later that month.
On 17 March the Rump passed an act abolishing the monarchy and two days later an act abolishing the House of Lords. On 29 May 1649 the Rump passed . It was a simple declaration that Parliament would appoint "Officers and Ministers under them for the good of the People... without any King or House of Lords".
Articles.
The "Instrument of Government" granted executive power to the Lord Protector. Although this post was elective, not hereditary, it was to be held for life. It also required the calling of triennial Parliaments, with each sitting for at least five months.
Adoption and replacement.
The "Instrument of Government" was adopted on 15 December 1653 and Oliver Cromwell was installed as Lord Protector on the following day. In January 1655, Cromwell dissolved the first Protectorate Parliament, ushering in a period of military rule by the Major Generals.
The "Instrument of Government" was replaced in May 1657 by England's second, and last, codified constitution, the Humble Petition and Advice.
Influence on the American constitution.
Since America had already been colonized by the English—in 1607, at Jamestown, and in 1620, at Plymouth—the United States has sometimes claimed this historic document as a part of its political, legal, and historic heritage.

Typology (urban planning and architecture)

Typology (in urban planning and architecture) is the taxonomic classification of (usually physical) characteristics commonly found in buildings and urban places, according to their association with different categories, such as intensity of development (from natural or rural to highly urban), degrees of formality, and school of thought (for example, modernist or traditional). Individual characteristics form patterns. Patterns relate elements hierarchically across physical scales (from small details to large systems).
The following is an example of a set of characteristics with typological associations: 
Single-family residences set well back from a street on large lots (about, one-fifth acre to two or more acres) and surrounded by mowed lawns with naturalistic ornamental plantings of trees and shrubs are associated typologically with North American suburban places. 
Single-family residences that come all the way forward on an individual lot so that the front of the building is coincident with front lot line, or which are set back only a few feet to accommodate a lightwell or front entry stoop, are associated typologically with highly urbanized places in North America. 
An emphasis on typology is characteristic of New Urbanism. New Urbanists believe it is important to match the physical development characteristics of a place within the appropriate typology for that place, as determined by local preferences taken in context with urban patterns as evidenced throughout history. Modernists, in keeping with their general disinclination to keep within the constraints of tradition and hierarchies of patterns, are less likely to focus on identifying the correct typology of a site.

Femmes du Maroc

Femmes du Maroc ("Women of Morocco") is a monthly Moroccan women's magazine. 
The magazine was first published in 1995. In 2007, each issue sold around 13.500 copies, which made it the most widely read monthly French language magazine in the country. It has an Arabic sister publication, "Nissae Min Al Maghrib", which sells more than twice as much.
"Femmes du Maroc" is published by the Moroccan publishing house Caractères and directed, together with "Nissae", by the Moroccan journalist Aïcha Zaïmi Sakhri, known for her strong support of women's rights. It has a large fashion and beauty section, besides other sections such as psychological advice aimed mainly at working women, advice for a more pleasurable sex life and, since 2004, a small section called 'celibattante', which translates loosely as 'unmarried and proud of it' and breaks the taboo of considering sexual relations only inside the marriage framework. It considers itself a feminist publication with a clear aim of changing the situation of women in the Moroccan society.
The magazine also offers long interviews with politicians, artists and activists and features articles that often criticize the patriarchal aspects of society. "Femmes du Maroc" has launched signature campaigns asking for legal reforms. It also sponsors "Caftan", an annual commercial fashion event.
Other Moroccan women magazines include "Citadine" (""Citizen"" founded in 1995, with 8.000 copies sold), "Ousra" (""Family"", in Arabic) and "Parade", all of them published in French, and "Citadine" (Arabic version, around 5.600 copies sold), "Lalla Fatima" (around 34.000 copies), and "Nissae Min Al Maghrib" (around 36.000 copies), in Arabic language.
