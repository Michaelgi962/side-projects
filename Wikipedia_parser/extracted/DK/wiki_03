Rahat Khan

Rahat Khan () (born 1940) is a Bangladeshi author, novelist, editor and journalist.
Life.
Rahat Khan was the editor of "Ittefaq".
Rahat Khan, hailing from Kishoreganj, was born in 1940. Graduating from the Department of Bangla Language and Literature in 1961 under the University of Dhaka, he engaged himself in teaching in which he earned much fame and popularity. During his eight years of teaching he served in different renowned colleges like Nasirabad College of Mymensingh, Jagannath College of Dhaka, Commerce College of Chittagong etc. In 1969, he changed his profession and joined the esteemed daily Bangla language newspaper The Ittefaq in the post of Assistant Editor. And now Rahat Khan is known as one of the most eminent journalists of the country. But surpassing all those above identities he is a fiction writer.
In one of his memoirs Rahat Khan recalled his early boyhood days when he, a student of class three, dared to write his first story. In his interview with Suhita Sultana for The Daily Banglabazar Patrika (dated: 27 February 1997) he told: ‘Then we were living in a village. One day a kite pounced on a small tortoise before our eyes. The event shocked me very much and made me tearful. I don’t know why but I wrote a story on it and thus my authorial life began.’ Though his pen never stopped his emergence as a writer took some more time. In 1972 his first volume of stories Onischito Lokaloy (Uncertain Human Habitation) was published which was followed by Ontohin Jatra (The Eternal Journey 1975); Bhalo Monder Taka (Money for Good and Evil, 1981); Apel Songbad (News of the Apple, 1983) etc. During the first years of the eighties Rahat Khan’s debut novel Omol Dhobol Chakri (Milk white Service) came out. His other novels include Ek Priyodorshini (A Beautiful Women, 1983); Chhyadompoti ( A Shadow Couple, 1984); Hey Shunyote (O, Emptiness, 1984); Songorsho (Clash, 1984); Shahor (The City, 1984); Hey Ononter Pakhi (O, Bird of Infinity, 1989); Modhomater Khelowar (The Forward Footballer, 1991). Alongside them his other novels like Akangsha (Desire), Koyekjon (A Few Person), Ognidaho (Conflagration), Hey Maton Bongo (O, Mother Bangla) are well acquainted to the Bangladeshi readership.
The common life observed in Rahat Khan’s novels comes out of the urban Dhaka society. Mostly the middle class and higher middle-class people take place in them. But as a journalist his experience abounded the higher-class society and even the lower poor class. We get the intermingle of them in his novels.
On the other hand as he passed his childhood and boyhood days in village home, we get the delineation of village picture in his novels. But it seem that novelist Rahat Khan feels much more easy in analysing and narrating the middle class mind. He can penetrate the earn the small feelings of them, their unexposed joy and sorrows, their sighs and boasts. If we look into the story line of the novel Omol Dhobol Chakri, we may find the justification of the above statement. Characters like Rafiq or Farhad or Mr. Ahahad’s wife are not very uncommon in our society, but the novelist presents them in such a way for which these characters and their surrounding appear before us as something novel and thus we discover uncommon personalities from these common people.
Rahat Khan gets delighted in portraying the boastfulness of the higher class society which is in reality a vague and vacant life. The features of urban society like its restlessness and frustration are commonly found in his novels. He can study the inner life of human beings and can draw them in a very meticulous way. The portrayal of sexual life that he makes of the urban people is very noteworthy.
The spirit of Ekushe February and Liberation war can also be felt in the works of Rahat Khan. He has composed a good number of songs where he took them as their themes. Alon with some of his stories the theme of liberation war can be found in his novels including Hey Matoh Bong, Hey Mohasunyota.
Rahat Khan is a lifelong writer. By now he has authored more than thirty-two novels which have brought many awards for him. He was honoured with the prestigious Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1973. The other honours that he received are: Suhrid Literary Award (1975); Sufi Motahar Hossain Award (1979); Mahbubullah Zebunnesa Trust Award (1979); Abul Mansur Memorial Award (1980); Humayun Qadir Memorial Award (1982); Troyi Literary Award (1988); Chetona Literary Award (1989) etc. The highest prize that he received for his literary endouvers is Ekushe Padak. In 1996, Rahat Khan was awarded with this highest national honour.

Rashid Karim

Rashid Karim (; 14 August 1925 – 26 November 2011) was a modern and popular novelist of Bangladesh.
Biography.
Rashid Karim was born in Kolkata, West Bengal in 1925. He did his BA from the Calcutta Islamia College (now Maulana Azad College), an affiliated college of the University of Calcutta. After the partition of the sub-continent in 1947, his family moved to Dhaka.
He began writing during the British period, continued during the Pakistan period but wrote his major novels during the Bangladesh period. It was in independent Bangladesh that his career as a writer reached its zenith. Rashid Karim penned his first story at the age of fourteen. So he began quite early. But his first story was published in 1942 in Mohammed Nasiruddin's Saogat. After that he did not write till 1961, when began the second phase of his writing career. His first novel "Uttam Purush" was published that year. It made him widely known and brought him the prestigious Adamjee Award. Two years later "Prashanna Pashan" instantly turned him into a major novelist of the Bengali language. Again he went into hibernation, this time for a decade. After the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971, he published his epic novel, "Amar Jato Glani", in 1973. This novel helped his fame reach its peak. Till this period he was known as a gifted writer who wrote less but wrote very well. But from then on he wrote and published regularly. "Prem Ekti Lal Golap" was published in 1978.
Rashid Karim had battled paralysis for nineteen years before his death. He could not write a single word during that long period and died at Ibrahim Cardiac Centre in Dhaka on November 26, 2011.
Published works.
Essays.
Three books of essays:
Critique on his novels.
"Uttam Purush" (উত্তম পুরুষ).
Through the character of "Shaker" of "Uttam Purush", the Muslim mind of the then Kolkata has been exposed. The Pakistan movement, which was nourished wholeheartedly by all Muslim people for their identity, takes an upper hand in the novel. Shaker is the embodiment of all characteristics available in the Muslim society – not even the political and cultural attitude go beyond. He supports the Muslim League and is a great fan of Muhammad Ali Jinnah and eventually relinquishes a sort of detest against Mahatma Gandhi and other Hindu leaders, though he is in the belief that Pakistan would be a country irrespective of Hindus and Muslims. Possibly, for that very reason, the narrator ‘I’ of the novel speaks about himself at the outset: "I am not an ideal man…. Not only for lack of power of character but the diversion of my mental attitude". The novel ends with Shaker’s migration from Kolkata to Dhaka. In the novel Rashid Karim has delineated the subconscious mind of the humans more acutely than the picture of the society and the compactness of the story.
"Prasanno Pashan" (প্রসন্ন পাষাণ).
The second novel of Rashid Karim, "Prasanno Pashan" received similar appraisal from the readers of Bangladesh. The story of this novel is also set in the city of Kolkata. The protagonist of this novel is "Tishna" who is the narrator of the novel herself. The whole novel is related in the first person narrative as her personal accounts. Like his first novel, this second one of Rashid Karim lacks the perfection to be a true picture of the then society. A very thin thread of the Kolkata's Muslim society may be observed in the novel. Rather the incidents of Tishna’s early life are the main focus of the novel. The novelist has tried to portray the like-sketch of Tishna and the influence of the episode of her Chhotofufu (younger aunt) and Chotochacha (younger uncle) on her life. The other characters like Alim and Karim also play importance roles in the plot of the novel. On the eve of her youth Tishna not only sympathised Kamil, rather she loved him: the proof of it is present in the end of the novel. We now understand that Tishna loved Kamil but the social prejudices prevented her to reach her love. Though Tishna is presented as the main character, her exposition comes through narration, rather than action – she rarely participates in them; rather she only watches. As a result she fails to create any permanent impression on the reader’s mind. On the other hand Chhotofufu, Tishna’s distant aunt Mayna, spans less in the novel but touches more deeply. The character of Kamil is also no better creation.
"Amar Jato Glani" (আমার যত গ্লানি).
The plot of this novel spans from the partition of 1947 to the 26th March 1971. The story is narrated, appropriate to say ‘told’, by Erphan Chowdhury. The other characters inserted are Ayesha, Ayesha’s husband Samad Saheb, Abid, Kohinur, Akkas, Nabi and others. We observe intermingle of Erphan’s personal experience in the socio-political milieu of the novel. In this novel, unlike the earlier two, Rashid Karim has been successful in the juxtaposition of psychoanalysis and external society. The successful use of stream of conscious in the frame of socio-political arena is really praiseworthy in "Amar Jato Glani".
"Prem Ekti Lal Golap" (প্রেম একটি লাল গোলাপ).
The novel for which Rashid Karim earned more reputation is "Prem Ekti Lal Golap". This is the most successful novel of him, or of the contemporary Bengali novels, for its meticulous psychoanalytic element. The novelist has placed the outer behaviour and the subconscious thoughts juxtapositionally are a well proportionate way. Rashid Karim’s expression in this regard is more spontaneous in Prem Ekti Lal Golap. Commenting on this novel Zillur Rahman Siddiqui, an eminent poet and critic of the country said: "He can visualize the great in the silly, the tiny movement of the soul can take a true picture in his pen and thus Rashid Karim has again proved that he is one of the greatest creative fiction writers of the country". 
In general<br>It is profound that autobiographical elements are present in Rashid Karim's novels, since his novels sketch the middle-class people and their socio-political environment, which is his own. If we look into his swangsong Jibon Moron we will find the presence of some similar incidents that the novelist himself experienced in his own life. He himself also went through an adolescent love affair with a girl whose name is not even exposed in the swangsong. The marriage of the girl imprinted a great shock on his mind and resultantly he gave up any sort of writing. Though the novelist has confessed that if this girl would not appear in his life, he would never be able to be a writer. Once upon a time he had relation with two girls, which is also a common subject in his novels. The shadows of this girl or their marriage are not very faint in Karim’s novels also. The shifting of Rashid Karim’s family to Dhaka from Kolkata is another significant autobiographical element that has taken a large space in his novels.
Literary style.
The novels of Rashid Karim have that capacity to give his readers a sort of cathartic feeling – and everyone will agree with the point that before his novels we did not meet such modern individuals in Bengali fiction. He is the pioneer Bengali novelist to expose the modern man – the flexibility and fickleness that every modern human being goes across regarding his love, sex and everything. No other contemporary Bengali novelist could expose the inner soul so tremendously. 
Publisher and writer Mofidul Haque said: "he was very confident about his writing. He wrote what he believed in. He taught us about the ecstasy of obtaining knowledge and passion".

Ulmus changii

Ulmus changii W. C. Cheng, occasionally known as the Hangzhou Elm, is a small deciduous tree found across much of China in forests at elevations of up to 1800 m. Owing to its increasing scarcity, "U. changii" was added to the Hainan Province Protected Plants List in 2006.
Description.
The tree can reach a height of 20 m with a trunk of about 0.9 m d.b.h; the bark is dark grey. The leaves are generally ovate, < 11 cm long, glabrescent and smooth when mature. The wind-pollinated apetalous flowers are produced on second-year shoots in March - April, the samarae are almost orbicular, < 35 mm in diameter. 
Pests and diseases.
"U. changii" was found to be among the least suitable elms for feeding and reproduction by the adult elm leaf beetle "Xanthogaleruca luteola" [http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1603/0022-0493%282001%29094%5B0162%3AROTCEU%5D2.0.CO%3B2] in the USA.
Cultivation.
The species is extremely rare in cultivation beyond China, although in the USA the species is rated hardy enough for USDA zone 5. There are no known cultivars of this taxon, nor is it known to be in commerce.
Subspecies & varieties.
Two varieties are recognized: var. "changii" L.K.Fu, and var. "kunmingensis" W.C.Cheng.
Etymology.
The tree is named for S. S. Chang, the Chinese botanist who identified the species in 1936.

Dagenham Dock

Dagenham Dock is a place in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham in London, England. It is located to the south of Dagenham and on the River Thames. It was once the site of a large coaling port and continues to be the location of a small terminal licensed to handle coal off-loading. Today the site is used for a number of river-related uses including a TDG (now Norbert Dentressangle) depot with around 200 tanks for storage of petrol, distillates, aviation fuel, biofuels, tallow, ethanol, fertilisers, urea etc.
History.
The dock was constructed at the site of Dagenham Breach, an area of flooded marsh caused by the breaching of the sea wall in 1707, and repeatedly flooded in the 18th Century. After a number of failed attempts, in 1865 Sir John Rennie built a jetty and a branch railway, but the company failed financially. The site was acquired and Dagenham Dock was constructed over from 1887 by Samuel Williams.
Early in the 20th Century HMS "Thunderer", the last major warship built on the Thames, was fitted out at a new jetty, still known as the Thunderer Jetty.
Barking Reach Power Station was constructed between 1992 and 1995 on Chequers Lane, and was the first major generating station to be built in London for many years.
Geography.
The area is planned to be the site of an environmentally sustainable business cluster, part of the London Riverside section of the Thames Gateway zone. Expansion of the little-used Dagenham Dock railway station is expected to aid the development including services on the Docklands Light Railway and East London Transit.

Claude Voilier

Claude Voilier was a French teacher, journalist, translator (especially of popular English children's series such as The Three Investigators and The Dana Girls into French), and a prolific author, having written over 600 short stories for various French magazines, and about 400 stories for children. In the English-speaking world, she is best known for her continuation of Enid Blyton's The Famous Five series of children's adventure novels. 
Claude Voilier was born Andrée Labedan around 1930. She wrote two popular novels for children, "Le manoir des cinq preux" and "Celle qu'on retrouva". She was living in Arcachon (Gironde), France, at the time of her death in May 2009.
Voilier's Famous Five series.
Starting from the early 1970s, and continuing up to the mid-1980s, Voilier wrote a series of books based on Enid Blyton's Famous Five series. The series comprises 24 books, 18 of which have been translated into English by Anthea Bell. Voilier had translated some of the later Blyton Famous Five books into French, and this was a major reason why she was asked to continue the series.[http://livres-d-enfants.conceptbb.com/Enid-Blyton-f6/Le-Club-des-Cinq-par-Claude-Voilier-t80.htm]
The numbering of the English translations is quite different from the French order. There follows a list of the original French series, with English titles where applicable. The 18 English titles will then be listed in their series order.
Original French Famous Five series.
The original French Famous Five series by Claude Voilier was published by Bibliothèque Rose, a division of the giant French publishing house Hachette. Jean Sidobre illustrated the first 12 as well as the penultimate volume. Claude Pascal illustrated a further seven. Buci illustrated "Les Cinq contre les fantômes" and Anne-Claude Martin illustrated "Les Cinq en Amazonie" and "Les Cinq contre le loup-garou".
In the original hardback editions, the books do not have chapters, and every second page has a comic strip-style illustration that sums up the main action in the text on the opposite page. The comics are one to three panels in length. Most of these illustrations are in black and white, but every so often there is a single-panel full-page colour illustration. However, later paperback editions published in the 1990s dispense with the comics and instead use black-and-white illustrations by Anne Bozellec. These illustrations only appear at intervals rather than on every second page. The paperback editions are also divided into chapters.
A full list of the original French series follows below:
1. "Les Cinq sont les plus forts" (1971; English title: "The Famous Five and the Mystery of the Emeralds")
2. "Les Cinq au bal des espions" (1971; English title: "The Famous Five in Fancy Dress")
3. "Le Marquis appelle les Cinq" (1972; English title: "The Famous Five and the Stately Homes Gang")
4. "Les Cinq au Cap des tempêtes" (1972; English title: "The Famous Five and the Missing Cheetah")
5. "Les Cinq à la Télévision" (1973; English title: "The Famous Five Go on Television")
6. "Les Cinq et les pirates du ciel" (1973; English title: "The Famous Five and the Hijackers")
7. "Les Cinq contre le masque noir" (1974; English title: "The Famous Five Versus the Black Mask")
8. "Les Cinq et le galion d'or" (1974; English title: "The Famous Five and the Golden Galleon")
9. "Les Cinq font de la brocante" (1975; English title: "The Famous Five and the Inca God")
10. "Les Cinq se mettent en quatre" (1975; English title: "The Famous Five and the Pink Pearls")
11. "Les Cinq dans la cité secrète" (1976; English title: "The Famous Five and the Secret of the Caves")
12. "La fortune sourit aux Cinq" (1976; English title: "The Famous Five and the Cavalier's Treasure")
13. "Les Cinq et le rayon Z" (1977; English title: "The Famous Five and the Z-Rays")
14. "Les Cinq vendent la peau de l'ours" (1977; English title: "The Famous Five and the Blue Bear Mystery")
15. "Les Cinq aux rendez-vous du diable" (1978; English title: "The Famous Five in Deadly Danger")
16. "Du neuf pour les Cinq" (1978; English title: "The Famous Five and the Strange Legacy")
17. "Les Cinq et le trésor de Roquépine" (1979; English title: "The Famous Five and the Knights' Treasure")
18. "Les Cinq et le diamant bleu" (1979; reprinted in 1980 as "Les Cinq et le rubis d'Akbar"; never translated into English) 
19. "Les Cinq jouent serré" (1980; English title: "The Famous Five and the Strange Scientist")
20. "Les Cinq en croisière" (1980; never translated into English)
21. "Les Cinq contre les fantômes" (1981; never translated into English)
22. "Les Cinq en Amazonie" (1983; never translated into English)
23. "Les Cinq et le trésor du pirate" (1984; never translated into English)
24. "Les Cinq contre le loup-garou" (1985; never translated into English)
The series in English.
18 of the titles were translated into English by Anthea Bell and published in paperback by Knight Books. They were subsequently published again in the early 1990s by Hodder and Stoughton. The Hodder editions have slightly revised titles; instead of e.g. "The Famous Five and the Strange Legacy", the Hodder editions say "The Five and the Strange Legacy" etc., which is closer to the original French.
The formatting is rather different from the French series (at least, from the original hardback versions on which the translations are almost certainly based), in that the translated versions have chapters. The Knight editions also have a number of illustrations that are loosely based on the French style. They are full-page, in black and white and have one or two panels. They are not as ubiquitous as in the French versions however, and are not really in a true comic-strip style. Illustrations were omitted entirely from the Hodder editions.
A complete list of the English titles is given below:
1. "The Famous Five and the Stately Homes Gang" (first published by Knight Books in 1981; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five and the Stately Homes Gang")
2. "The Famous Five and the Mystery of the Emeralds" (first published by Knight Books in 1981; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five and the Mystery of the Emeralds")
3. "The Famous Five and the Missing Cheetah" (first published by Knight Books in 1981; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five and the Missing Cheetah")
4. "The Famous Five Go on Television" (first published by Knight Books in 1981; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five Go on Television")
5. "The Famous Five and the Golden Galleon" (first published by Knight Books in 1982; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five and the Golden Galleon")
6. "The Famous Five Versus the Black Mask" (first published by Knight Books in 1982; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five Versus the Black Mask")
7. "The Famous Five in Fancy Dress" (first published by Knight Books in 1983; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five in Fancy Dress")
8. "The Famous Five and the Blue Bear Mystery" (first published by Knight Books in 1983; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five and the Blue Bear Mystery")
9. "The Famous Five and the Inca God" (first published by Knight Books in 1984; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five and the Inca God")
10. "The Famous Five and the Cavalier's Treasure" (first published by Knight Books in 1984; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1993 as "The Five and the Cavalier's Treasure")
11. "The Famous Five and the Strange Legacy" (first published by Knight Books in 1984; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five and the Strange Legacy")
12. "The Famous Five and the Secret of the Caves" (first published by Knight Books in 1984; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five and the Secret of the Caves")
13. "The Famous Five and the Hijackers" (first published by Knight Books in 1985; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five and the Hijackers")
14. "The Famous Five and the Strange Scientist" (first published by Knight Books in 1985; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five and the Strange Scientist")
15. "The Famous Five in Deadly Danger" (first published by Knight Books in 1985; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five in Deadly Danger")
16. "The Famous Five and the Knight's Treasure" (first published by Knight Books in 1986; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five and the Knight's Treasure")
17. "The Famous Five and the Z-Rays" (first published by Knight Books in 1986; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five and the Z-Rays")
18. "The Famous Five and the Pink Pearls" (first published by Knight Books in 1987; later republished by Hodder and Stoughton in 1994 as "The Five and the Pink Pearls")
Possible 25th volume.
In 1996, a book written by Claude Voilier and illustrated by Anne Bozellec, entitled "Les Cinq et le secret du vieux puits" ("The Five and the Secret of the Old Well"), was published and may constitute the 25th volume in the series. However, from the rather scant information available about the book, it appears as though it may be little more than a rewrite or updated translation of "Le Club des Cinq et le vieux puits", which is the French version of "Five Have a Mystery to Solve", the 20th book in Enid Blyton's original The Famous Five series. So unlike the first 24 volumes of the Voilier series, it is almost certainly not a truly new story and hence should probably be classified as being among the French translations of Blyton's series.
The Three Investigators connection.
Claude Voilier has translated some volumes of The Three Investigators series into French. One of the stories in this series, The Mystery of the Silver Spider, is set in the fictitious country of Varania. In "The Famous Five and the Strange Scientist", the character of Professor Kolkov comes from Varania, which makes for an interesting little crossover connection between the French Famous Five series and The Three Investigators series.

Katwijk aan Zee

Katwijk aan Zee (literally, "Katwijk-on-Sea") is a seaside resort located on the North Sea at the mouth of the Oude Rijn. It is situated in the municipality of Katwijk and the province of South Holland.
History.
The name "Katwijk" probably has its origins in the name of a Germanic tribe called the Chatten (Chatti). The Dutch word ""wijk"" means "area", so the name probably meant something like "the Chatti area".
In Roman times, Katwijk was a place of strategic importance. It was located at the Roman Empire's northern border, at the mouth of the Rhine river, which in Roman times was larger in this area than it is today. There was a good deal of traffic along the Rhine. Katwijk was also a jumping-off point for the voyage to Britain. Built during the reign of Emperor Claudius (41–54), the town's name was "Lugdunum". The town's name was later associated with the name of the city of Leiden, but this is now thought to be incorrect.
After the Romans left the settlement was abandoned and the area largely depopulated, except for small, isolated groups of Frisians ekeing out a living along the changing coast. The area was Christianised by British and Irish missionaries around the 9th century.
Starting around the 12th century the population began to grow. In 1231, the first reference to "Catwijck" appeared in the records. At this time Katwijk aan Zee was little more than a few wooden houses.
A reference to a fish market on the beach appeared in the records around 150 years later. In 1388, the fish market was moved from Katwijk aan den Rijn to Katwijk aan Zee. Katwijk aan Zee and Katwijk aan den Rijn were part of the same heerlijkheid called "Beide de Katwijken en 't Zand" (or something similar). They have been administratively joined for centuries.
In 1520 a Roman ruin known as "Brittenburg" emerged from the shifting sands on the beach just south of the mouth of the Oude Rijn, much to everyone's astonishment. It became the subject of a number of prints and paintings. It was square in shape, each side measuring 75 m, and the ruins stood about 3 m high. Eventually it disappeared back under the shifting sands. Attempts have been made to find it again, but to no avail.
Katwijk aan Zee emerged from the Reformation as a staunchly Protestant town, a reputation it still has today. It's also named to be an enclave of the Dutch Bible-belt ('Bijbelriem') that covers the area from the North-South side of Holland ('Zeeland') to Middle-East, where there's the Veluwe forest. The main religion in the Bible-belt and therefore also in Katwijk aan Zee is a strict form of Calvinism.
Amplified by the strict form of religion, the differences with neighbouring communities and the non-migratory nature of members of the old Katwijk families, Katwijk aan Zee continued its existence as a quiet, close-knit North Sea fishing village from the 16th century. 
Although fishing is not a major activity in the village today and many of the inhabitants are nowadays secular, the old traditions still survive in many ways. Most of the inhabitants are still very traditional, whether they are member of a Calvinist church or not.
Katwijk aan Zee had its own unique dialect, called 'Katwijks' or 'Strand-Hollands' ('Kattuks' in dialect). This dialect is still spoken by a considerable number of people, therefore being one of the few active dialects of Hollandic still in active use. Yet, fewer youngsters learn to speak the dialect actively.
Over the course of time the mouth of the Oude Rijn silted up. However, a locks was constructed at the mouth of the river in 1807 by engineer F. W. Conrad (d. 1808). After this the Old Rhine (here called the "Uitwateringskanaal") did not flow naturally into the sea, but was held back by a lock. When necessary, the lock can be opened to allow the river to flow out to sea. The shore and the entrance to the canal were also strengthened by dikes.
During World War II, most of the buildings of Katwijk aan Zee were demolished by the Germans to make way for the Atlantic Wall. In the dunes south of Katwijk, many bunkers from World War II can still be found.
Since the 20th century, Katwijk aan Zee is a popular seaside resorts and the village grew explosively. In 1980–1990, Katwijk aan den Rijn and Hoornes-Rijnsoever became incorporated. Recently, in 2006, the neighbouring communities Valkenburg and Rijnsburg were added, which made a larger municipality called 'Katwijk'.
Other facts.
Katwijk aan Zee is the landing place for a large number of international and intercontinental Transatlantic telephone cables such as the TAT-14.
Katwijk aan Zee is the home town Netherlands forward Dirk Kuyt who currently plays for Fenerbahce.

Caen Guided Light Transit

The Caen guided light transit or Caen "TVR", locally known as the "Tram", is an electrically powered guided bus system in Caen, France, which uses Bombardier Guided Light Transit ("TVR" in French) technology. After a construction time lasting three years, the system opened on 18 November 2002 at a total cost of 227 million euros. The Caen transport company, "Twisto" (CTAC), is the current operator of the "TVR" system and calls the system the "Tram".
Service is provide by 24 three-section articulated vehicles, guided by a central non-supporting rail. The entire passenger line is guided, and in normal service the vehicles are powered by electricity drawn from an overhead wire through a pantograph. The vehicles have auxiliary diesel engines and steering wheels and are able to operate away from the guide rail, but only in diesel mode, and under normal operating conditions they run only in electric mode when carrying passengers along the route, using their diesel engines only when travelling to and from the depot (garage). The use of pantographs for current collection means the Caen vehicles cannot move laterally away from the overhead wire when operating in electric mode, and for this reason they are not considered to be trolleybuses, under the English language meaning of that word, and the system is sometimes referred to as a "rubber-tyred tramway".
History.
It was in 1988 that the SMTCAC ("Syndicat Mixte des Transports en Commun de l'Agglomération Caennaise") first considered developing public transport on a large-scale. However, the opening of the bus system was not without problems as well as lack of interest in the system by the population with only 23% backing the project, in 1994, Viacités, one of the guided bus' network partners closed a contract with the consortium STVR ("Société the transport sur Voie Réservée"), existing construction company Spie Batignolles and Bombardier Transportation proceeded with infrastructure and vehicle construction. Due to financial contracts the municipality had no other choice but to push the project forward despite a relative lobby against the "tram".
Network.
The total network is 15.7 kilometres long and comprises two lines, A and B, with a common section running north–south in central Caen. The central section, between "Copernic" and "Poincaré", encompasses 15 stops. The entire network serves a total of 34 stops. There are plans for a second line running from east to west.
The "tram" current serves 40% of the public transport trips, 70 000 inhabitants and 60 000 jobs situated within 400m of the line.
Service frequency is high (3.5 to 7 minutes between vehicles) and operates between 05:30 and 00:30. Speed is 30% higher than conventional buses and stops are never more than 450 m apart.
Rolling stock.
Service is provided by Bombardier GLT guided buses, each 24.5m long and 3.40m high, and weighing 38 tons. Their top speed is 70 km/h.
Safety.
The system has been plagued with faults, due to design and operation; on 21 October 2004 a young boy named Nathan was run over and killed by a TVR vehicle in Rue Roger-Bastion. The vehicle, being bus-based, restricted to its guiding rail and lacking grip to brake in time, could not avoid the infant.

Replacement with light rail.
Viacités confirmed on 14 December 2011 its plans to abandon the TVR in favour of light rail by 2018, due to its unreliability. The light rail is set take 18 months to construct and has an approximately €170 million price tag.
The conversion to light rail will also mean the termination of two concession contracts that Keolis and Bombardier-Spie Batignolles consortium STVR hold.

Just a Gigolo (1978 film)

Just a Gigolo (Schöner Gigolo, armer Gigolo) is a 1978 film directed by David Hemmings and starring David Bowie. Set in post-World War I Berlin, it also featured Sydne Rome, Kim Novak and, in her last screen appearance, Marlene Dietrich. The hostile reception the film received led Bowie to quip that it was "my 32 Elvis Presley movies rolled into one".
Plot.
A Prussian officer (David Bowie) returns home to Berlin following the end of the Great War. Unable to find employment elsewhere, he works as a gigolo in a brothel run by the Baroness (Marlene Dietrich). He is eventually killed in street fighting between Nazis and Communists. Both sides claim his body but the Nazis succeed in capturing it and bury him with honours, "a hero to a cause he did not support".
Production.
Around the time of its release, David Hemmings said that "Just a Gigolo" was intended to be "highly ironic, tongue-in-cheek, about the period". Marlene Dietrich was persuaded to come out of retirement to make the film, reportedly receiving $250,000 for two days' shooting.
It was Bowie's first movie role after Nicolas Roeg's "The Man Who Fell to Earth" (1976). As Roeg's film had played upon Bowie's earlier identification with science fiction and alienness, so "Just a Gigolo" fitted his then-current interest in pre-war Berlin, pricked by meeting Christopher Isherwood, whose "Goodbye to Berlin" had inspired the musical "Cabaret". The city had also been the recording location for Bowie's latest studio album, ""Heroes"" (1977).
The singer has variously claimed that he took the role "as a favour to Hemmings", who at the time was also planning to produce a documentary of Bowie's 1978 concert tour, and because "Marlene Dietrich was dangled in front of me". Actually, the two stars never met. Dietrich played her brief part in Paris, where she lived, with the result simply being cut into Bowie's scenes that were shot, along with the rest of the film, in Berlin.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack of "Just a Gigolo" included jazz and cabaret standards performed by various acts including Pasadena Roof Orchestra, The Manhattan Transfer and the Village People. As well as appearing on screen, Sydne Rome sang a track called "Don't Let It Be Too Long", by David Hemmings and composer Günther Fischer, while Marlene Dietrich performed the song "Just a Gigolo".
Unlike his work on "The Man Who Fell to Earth", Bowie did contribute a piece of music to the film; his so-called "Revolutionary Song" was co-written with musical director Jack Fishman and played by a band called The Rebels. It was released in Japan as a single, which later became something of a collectors item.
Release and aftermath.
The film opened in Berlin on 16 November 1978. It received poor reviews and was pulled from cinemas. Hemmings recut the picture for its UK premiere in Leicester Square on 14 February 1979 where, at an ostensibly black-tie affair, Bowie and his date wore kimonos. Reviews were again negative; the "Sunday Mirror" called the film "all show and no substance" and considered Bowie "completely miscast", while "Time Out" advised its readers to simply "overlook it".
In an interview with "NME" in September 1980, Bowie was quoted as saying:
Bowie's biographers have labelled the film "an active pain", "an unadulterated flop", and a "debacle". Its reputation among mainstream critics generally remains low, Halliwell's calling it an "international misadventure... interminable... clumsily made", while Leonard Maltin describes it as a "weird melodrama". Allmovie's Hal Erickson has nevertheless given the film a 3-star rating.
"Just a Gigolo" was released to DVD in 2004.

Lipulekh pass is connected to Chang Lobochahela, near the old trading town of Purang (Taklakot), in Tibet.
The pass is first Indian border post to be opened for trade with China in 1992. This was followed by the opening of Shipki La, Himachal Pradesh in 1994 and Nathu La, Sikkim in 2006. Presently, Lipulekh is open for cross-border trade every year from June through September.

The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)

In 1979 the US National Public Radio broadcast a radio dramatization of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It was produced by The Mind's Eye and has since been made available by several different companies.
It is sometimes confused with the later BBC production in 1981, but is distinguished by the fact that the most widely circulated US edition comes in a wooden box, whether on compact discs or cassette tapes. The Mind's Eye cast for "The Hobbit" (a separate production) recorded their tracks separately (unlike the BBC production which, like most British radio serials, assembled the cast to record their dialogue together) but the adaptation for "The Lord of the Rings" was recorded en group and received much praise as being better than the Mind's Eye productions ("a masterpiece" (The Courier), "spirited production, stirring music" (Washington Post), "The best available" (Booklist).
The cast includes Ray Reinhardt (Bilbo), James Arrington (Frodo), Pat Franklyn (Merry), Mac McCaddon (Pippin), Lou Bliss (Sam), Bernard Mayes (Gandalf), Gail Chugg (Narrator), Bernard Mayes (Tom Bombadil), and Tom Luce (Strider/Aragorn). Additionally, Franklyn, McCaddon, Chugg, Reinhardt, Bob Lewis, John Vickery, Erik Bauersfeld and Carl Hague were credited for "additional voices".
The radio script of "The Lord of the Rings" was written by Bernard Mayes, was an abridged version of the book, and emphasized dialogue over description. The broadcasts totaled more than 11 hours. The budget was small and production time was limited. The cast were local theater players, and the production used stock music and homemade sound effects. The script of "The Lord Of The Rings" is notable for including the Tom Bombadil scenes, unlike most other adaptations of the book.
Radio drama was a rarity in the United States at that time, and this production was popular at the time of its broadcast. It was later overshadowed by the BBC radio dramatization. The Mind's Eye also produced a six-hour adaptation of "The Hobbit".
The Mind's Eye adaptation has also been identified with Soundelux, and, most recently, with Highbridge. The name changes correspond to the companies which owned the rights at different times.
The newer editions of the drama on compact disc and MP3 have a somewhat shorter running time than the original cassettes, omitting or condensing a considerable amount of dialogue and narration.

United States women's national under-23 soccer team

The United States U-23 women's national soccer team is a youth soccer team operated under the auspices of U.S. Soccer. Its primary role is the development of players in preparation for the full Women's National Team. The team's most recent major tournament was the 2008 Nordic Cup, in which the United States team won 3-0 over Germany. The team competes in a variety of competitions, including the annual Nordic Cup, which is the top competition for this age group. The current head coach is Randy Waldrum.
History.
Beginnings as a U-20 program.
The United States U-23 team has been active since 1989, however it was run as a U-20 team from its inception until 1998. Its main goal was to prepare college players for the step up to international soccer. Women had no viable opportunities to enhance their playing abilities, aside from overseas, since the United States lacked a top-level domestic league during this time.
The switch to U-21.
In 1998, United States Soccer Federation decided to make the team a U-21 team in order to give women a higher level of play to better prepare them for the full National Team. In accordance with this strategy, the U-21 team frequently rostered "over-aged" players in the U-21 training camps, as well as the Nordic Cup. It remained a U-21 team from 1998 through 2008.
Competing as a U-23 team.
2008 saw the change of the USA's oldest youth national team moved to the U-23 level. The move was made by the United States Soccer Federation in response to age-level changes FIFA had made to its oldest women's youth competition, now named FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. The age limit was raised from being a U-19 tournament to a U-20 tournament. This change, coupled with a newly introduced U-23 age limit to the Nordic Cup, prompted the USSF to rethink and eventually change the youth development team. The team continues serve as a stepping-stone for collegiate and post-collegiate players to the United States Women's National Team. Additionally, many U-23 players develop further through the new national women's league, the NWSL. While many of the post-collegiate players play in this new league to develop their game, the U-23's turned focus on college players who are out of season and may not yet be NWSL-eligible.
Current players.
2014 Six Nations Tournament roster.
The United States won the tournament with victories over Japan (1-0) on March 1, Sweden (2-1) on March 3, and Norway (2-1) on March 5. Defender Abby Dahlkemper was the only U.S. player to play every minute of the three matches in the tournament.

Winnats Pass is in the High Peak area of the English county of Derbyshire. It lies to the west of the village of Castleton, in the National Trust's High Peak Estate. The road winds through a cleft, surrounded by towering limestone pinnacles. The pass was once thought to have originated as a giant collapsed cavern; however, a more recent explanation is that it was a ravine between the coral reefs that originally formed the limestone. The name is a corruption of 'wind gates'. A local legend is that the pass is haunted after a young couple were murdered by miners.
The permanent closure of the main A625 road at Mam Tor in 1979 due to subsidence has resulted in Winnats Pass being heavily used by road traffic. However, the narrowness of the road and its maximum >28% (1 in 3.5) gradient has caused it to be closed to buses, coaches and vehicles over 7.5 tonnes in weight. The road regularly features in the Tour of the Peak cycle race each autumn.

Cabrits National Park is on a peninsula at the north end of the Caribbean island of Dominica, north of Portsmouth. The park protects tropical forest, coral reefs and wetlands. There are hiking trails and an English garrison called Fort Shirley. Cabrits National Park occupies 1,313 acres (531 ha) and was established in 1986.
The word Cabrits means goat in Spanish, French and Portuguese, and is a reference to the animal that has been indigenous to Cabrits. Goats were introduced to the island by sailors, who set them free on the island to grow, so that there would be meat available when they returned.
Fort Shirley.
Fort Shirley was formerly a military outpost, a sterling example of its kind in the West Indies. The British built it in the 18th century garrison to defend north Dominica. It was later abandoned, and after suffering for years, Dr. Lennox Honychurch began restoration in 1989.

Just a Gigolo (song)

"Just a Gigolo" is a popular song, adapted by Irving Caesar in 1929 from the Austrian song "Schöner Gigolo, armer Gigolo", written in 1928 in Vienna by Leonello Casucci (music) and Julius Brammer (lyrics). 
History.
The song was first published by Boheme Verlag in 1929 and performed by several orchestras in Germany that year, including Dajos Béla's orchestra with the singer Kurt Mühlhardt. In Italy Daniel Serra sang a version, followed by Sirio Di Piramo and his orchestra in 1930, while other countries provided their own versions. 
The original version is a poetic vision of the social collapse experienced in Austria after World War I, represented by the figure of a former hussar who remembers himself parading in his uniform, while now he has to get by as a lonely hired dancer. The music features a simple melodic sequence, but nonetheless has a clever harmonic construction that highlights the mixed emotions in the lyrics, adding a nostalgic, bittersweet effect.
The success of the song prompted publishers Chappell & Co. to buy the rights and order an English version from Irving Caesar, a very popular lyricist of the time. Caesar eliminated the specific Austrian references and, in the often-omitted verse (but included in the 1931 recording by Bing Crosby), set the action in a Paris cafe, where a local character tells his sad story. Thus, the lyrics retained their sentimental side but lost their historic value.
"Just a Gigolo" appeared in a 1931 film, a 1932 Betty Boop cartoon and a 1993 TV-series, all titled after the song. The song was recorded by many musicians of the time, including Louis Armstrong and (in German) Richard Tauber. 
The film "Schöner Gigolo, armer Gigolo", directed by David Hemmings in 1979, was titled after the first verse of the original lyrics, but the "Just a Gigolo" title was used for US distribution. In this film, the song was performed by Marlene Dietrich, in her last film appearance.
"Just a Gigolo"/"I Ain't Got Nobody" medley.
Origin.
"Just a Gigolo" is best known in a form recorded by Louis Prima in 1956, where it was paired in a medley with another old standard, "I Ain't Got Nobody" (words by Roger A. Graham and music by Spencer Williams, 1915). Although these two songs have nothing else in common, the popularity of Prima's combination, and of the Village People's 1978 and David Lee Roth's 1985 cover versions of the medley, has led to the mistaken perception by some that the songs are two parts of a single original composition.
The coupling of the two songs had its genesis in an earlier Louis Prima recording from 1945, which was then adapted by Sam Butera for Prima's 1950s Las Vegas stage show, during which Prima would revisit his old hits in a new, jive-and-jumping style. The success of that act gained Prima a recording deal with Capitol Records, which aimed to capture on record the atmosphere of his shows. The first album, titled "The Wildest!" and released in November 1956, opened with "Just a Gigolo"/"I Ain't Got Nobody", which then became Prima's signature number and helped relaunch his career.
Recording.
The recording session took place in April 1956 at Capitol Tower Studios, Los Angeles, and was produced by Voyle Gilmore. Prima was backed by his Las Vegas group, Sam Butera & the Witnesses, in its original line-up: Sam Butera (tenor sax), James "Red" Blount (trombone), William "Willie" McCumber (piano), Jack Marshall (guitar), Amado Rodriques (bass) and Robert "Bobby" Morris (drums). Keely Smith, who was Prima's wife and an important part of his act, joined the Witnesses for the characteristic backing vocals. Prima sang the lead but didn't play the trumpet on this track.
List of versions.
The following artists have released or performed versions of the song:
Cultural references.
The song is sung in Floyd Gottfredson's "Mickey Mouse" comic strip first published May 14, 1931 (part of a story called "High Society").
The song lyrics are parodied in an original "Star Trek" novel, "How Much for Just the Planet?" (1987) by John M. Ford.
On his 1962 album, Oh Yeah, a piano-playing Charles Mingus repeatedly sings the first line of the song in his own composition, "Devil Woman".
The Crosby version of the song plays during the final scene and credits of "Mad Men" season 6/episode 3: "The Collaborators".
The song is being played on a piano during the Zeppelin scene in the film "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" while two characters are talking about a woman.
The Prima verson of the song can be heard in the trailer for the 2013 John Turturro film, Fading Gigolo.
The song is featured in the 2013 rhythm game Just Dance 2014 for Nintendo Wii, Wii U, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
The Prima version is also sung by Robert De Niro in "Mad Dog and Glory" (1993).

Milecastle 49

Milecastle 49 (Harrows Scar) was a milecastle on Hadrian's Wall ().
Description.
Milecastle 49 is situated immediately west of the gorge of the River Irthing where the Wall was carried over the river by the bridge at Willowford. The scar or cliff and hence the milecastle are named after an ancient tenement called The Harrows which stood nearby. The tenement is shown on William Howard's 1603 map of the Barony of Gilsland and on an estate map of The Shaws commissioned by John Carrick around 1800.
Harrows Scar measures 19.8 metres east to west by 22.9 metres north to south and no contemporary internal buildings are now visible. It is built with narrow gauge defensive walls which are bonded with the Narrow Wall curtain of Hadrian's Wall on either side. It has Type III gateways. It lies 1458m west of Milecastle 48 and 1391m east of Milecastle 50.
The monument is currently in the care of English Heritage. It was designated as a Scheduled Monument (number:13987) on 14 July 1997.
Excavations.
It was excavated in 1898, and in 1953 by I. A. Richmond, when parts of the underlying Turf Wall milecastle (49TW) were identified.
Associated Turrets.
Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 49 are known as Turret 49A and Turret 49B.
Turret 49A.
Turret 49A (TW) () was constructed when the turf wall was built. The turret was demolished when the Birdoswald fort was built. Traces of it were found during investigations in 1945. Turret 49A was located on or near the headquarters building. There are no visible remains of the turret.
Turret 49B.
Turret 49B (Birdoswald) () lies 340 metres west of the west rampart of Birdoswald fort. It was excavated in 1911. The masonry remains have been consolidated and exposed. 
It replaced the earlier turf wall turret (49B TW; ) which was dismantled when the stone wall was built.

Auckland Domain

The Auckland Domain is Auckland's oldest park, and at 75 hectares one of the largest in the city. Located in the central suburb of Grafton, the park contains all of the explosion crater and most of the surrounding tuff ring of the Pukekawa volcano.
The park is home to one of Auckland's main tourist attractions, the Auckland War Memorial Museum, which sits prominently on the crater rim (tuff ring). Several sports fields occupy the floor of the crater, circling to the south of the cone, while the rim opposite the Museum hosts the cricket pavilion and Auckland City Hospital. The Wintergarden, with two beautiful glass houses, lie on the north side of the central scoria cone. The fernery has been constructed in an old quarry in part of the cone. The duck ponds lie in the northern sector of the explosion crater, which is breached to the north with a small overflow stream.
Volcano.
The Auckland Domain volcano, Pukekawa, is one of the oldest in the Auckland Volcanic Field, and consists of a large explosion crater surrounded by a tuff ring with a small scoria cone ("Pukekaroro") in the centre of the crater. Its tuff ring, created by many explosive eruptions, is made of a mixture of volcanic ash, lapilli and fragmented sandstone country rock. Its eruption followed soon (in geological terms) after the neighbouring Grafton Volcano was created, destroying that volcano's eastern parts and burying the rest.
Originally, the crater floor was filled with a lava lake, the western half collapsed slightly and became a freshwater lake which later turned into a swamp and slowly filled up with alluvium and sediment, before being drained by Europeans for use as playing fields and parkland. These origins are still somewhat visible in that the Duck Ponds are freshwater-fed from the drainage of the crater.
History.
Maori habitation.
Pukekawa was identified by the Māori early on as one of the best sites in the isthmus area, with the north-facing side of the volcanic cone well-suited for growing kūmara, while the hill itself was used for storage and as a pā site. The crater swamp meanwhile provided eels and water.
Pukekawa means 'hill of bitter memories' in the Māori language, and likely refers to various hard-fought tribal battles between the Ngapuhi and the Ngati Whatua iwi. A sacred totara, commemorating the battles and their eventual settlement, was reputedly planted by princess Te Puea Herangi and still stands on the central volcanic cone.
European usage.
After the Europeans bought the land from the Ngati Whatua, it was set aside as a public reserve in 1843 by Governor FitzRoy, probably working from an idea of William Hobson. It remains one of the city's greatest assets. It was initially called "Auckland Park", but was soon referred to on maps and documents as the "Auckland Domain". During the 1860s the Domain springs were a source of water for the town of Auckland, while the original swamp was drained and turned into a cricket field. The Auckland Acclimatisation Society located their gardens here in the 1860s which were later developed into the Auckland Botanic Gardens. Parts of the layout still exist north of the band rotunda including some greenhouses from the 1870s.
In the 1850s the then Governor-General Gore-Browne eyed up the Domain as the setting for the new Government House. He was displeased with both the existing house's location in Waterloo Quadrant and also its style (and especially that it was of wood imitating stone construction). He envisaged a castle-style masonry residence similar to the Sydney Government House, which is also set in a large landscaped domain like Auckland's. Plans were drawn up, but the Premier of the time, Weld, refused to authorise funds for the project and so the Auckland Domain remained freely accessible to the public as it had been intended. The Governor General's residence was later relocated from Waterloo Quadrant to Mount Eden in the early 1960s.
A great many exotic specimen trees were donated and planted throughout the Domain by the late Victorians which have now matured into a splendid landscape park. They are now augmented by many New Zealand species. The wooden Cricket Pavilion designed by Mr Gorrie was built in 1898 as a replacement for an earlier structure that burnt down.
1910 saw the first ever rugby league test match in New Zealand when Great Britain defeated the New Zealand at the Domain's cricket ground as part of the 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand.
In 1913 the Domain was the site of the Auckland Exhibition whose president was local businessman William Elliot. The financial return from this event resulted in many improvements, the chief one being the splendid Wintergardens next to the duckponds. The teahouse was built as the "ideal home" exhibition set piece and retained after the rest of the exhibition was dismantled. An example of an Arts and Crafts cottage, it stands between the Wintergardens and the duckponds.
During the 1920s & 1930s William Elliot donated several of the marble statues as well as money to complete the Wintergarden complex. He provided a further sum of money to construct the splendid Art Deco Domain entrance gates on Road. Designed by Gummer and Ford architects, The gates are surmounted by a bronze statue of a nude male athlete by the NZ sculptor Richard Gross. The Auckland Domain is also the location of several other public artworks including Guy Nygan's "Millennium Tree".
Dominating the Auckland Domain is the Auckland War Memorial Museum and the Cenotaph in front of it (Architects Grierson, Aimer and Draffin). The large neo-Greek style museum building was opened in 1929 with the rear portion added in the 1960s, with a major renovation and extension in the middle 2000s adding an award-winning dome-shaped building in the inner courtyard.
In 1940, to commemorate the founding of Auckland in 1840, a new road was planned for the Domain. "Centennial Drive" was surveyed and trees planted its length but it was never formed as a road; it is now a walkway between the Duckponds and Stanley Street.
An 18,500 cubic meter water reservoir was constructed in 1953, buried in the field at the high point to the immediate south of the museum. The reservoir is still in use maintaining the water supply into Auckland's CBD.
Events.
The Domain has also hosted many of New Zealand's largest outdoor events. Such use has a long history, from balloon ascents during the Edwardian period, the 1953 Elizabeth II Royal Tour, Papal visits, and various sports events.
Some of the largest annual events are "Christmas in the Park", which in the past has drawn more than 200,000 spectators, and other popular recurring events including the "Symphony under the Stars" and the "Teddybears Picnic".
The 2005 Red Bull Trolley Grand Prix was held using Domain Drive as the racecourse.

13th Marine Expeditionary Unit

The 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (13th MEU) is one of seven Marine Expeditionary Units currently in existence in the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Expeditionary Unit is a Marine Air Ground Task Force with a strength of about 2,200 personnel. The MEU consists of a command element, a reinforced infantry battalion, a composite aviation squadron and a combat logistics battalion. The 13th MEU is currently based out of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California.
Mission.
The mission of the MEU is to provide geographic combatant commanders with a forward-deployed, rapid-response force capable of conducting conventional amphibious and selected maritime special operations at night or under adverse weather conditions from the sea, by surface and/or by air while under communications and electronics restrictions.
History.
Early years.
The 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) was activated at Camp Pendleton, California, February 1, 1985, as the 13th Marine Amphibious Unit. The unit was renamed as the 13th MEU February 5, 1988. It is one of three West Coast MEUs which make periodic deployments to the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf regions.
The “Fighting 13th” has experienced a number of firsts. It was the first West Coast MEU to be designated as Special Operations Capable, having trained to conduct a wide variety of special missions. It was the first MEU to deploy with Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC); an entire section of Avenger air defense weapons systems, the first to refuel ground vehicles with the Tactical Bulk Fuels Delivery System mounted in a CH-53E. Additionally, it was the first West Coast MEU to deploy with a force reconnaissance platoon, and the first to launch from an amphibious vessel USS Tarawa (LHA-1) and train with drone remotely piloted vehicles (as the 13th MAU in 1986).
1990s.
The 13th MEU (SOC)’s special operations capabilities were used extensively on its deployment during Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Beginning a routine deployment June 20, 1990, the MEU was diverted to Southwest Asia in August. The first amphibious force to arrive in the theater of operations, personnel conducted the first Marine offensive actions against Iraq. In October, elements boarded two Iraqi tankers that refused to obey United Nations sanctions.
The MEU’s last combat operation in Desert Storm was an Iraqi prisoner-of-war detainment on Faylaka Island, Kuwait, March 3, 1991, which resulted in 1,413 Iraqi prisoners being apprehended. The MEU returned to the United States April 16, after being deployed 301 consecutive days.
The 13th MEU (SOC) deployed again in January 1992. During this deployment, the MEU conducted training operations in the Persian Gulf, Africa and Thailand. Additionally, the MEU was the last deploying unit to visit the Philippines prior to the closure of Naval Station Subic Bay prior to returning that summer. The 13th MEU (SOC) arrived off the coast of Somalia in early October 1993 in response to increasing hostilities there. As a key element of the newly formed COMMARFOR Somalia, the 13th MEU (SOC) and 22nd MEU (SOC), remained on station ready to provide support to United States and United Nations forces.
In mid-November the 13th MEU (SOC) became the principle rapid response force in the region and executed two humanitarian assistance operations. The first, Operation Show Care, took place in the cities of Marka and Qoryooley from November 11–14. From December 1–3, Operation More Care was conducted in the Old Port of Mogadishu. Both operations provided needed medical and dental assistance to Somali citizens.
The 13th MEU (SOC) continued its presence mission through January 1994, providing aircraft for the “Eyes Over Mogadishu” missions as well as sniper support at the United States Embassy compound. The 13th MEU returned to the United States March 17.
The MEU deployed again October 25, only seven months after returning to Camp Pendleton. Following a scheduled exercise on Okinawa, November 11–13, the MEU sailed to the Persian Gulf. During this period the MEU conducted a Maritime Interdiction Operation/Visit Board Search and Seizure (MIO/VBSS) mission aboard the Honduran-flagged merchant vessel Ajmer, which was in violation of United Nations sanctions on Iraq.
In January 1995, the 13th MEU (SOC) was ordered to conduct Operation United Shield - the withdrawal of UNOSOM forces from Somalia. The MEU sailed to Africa and conducted operation rehearsals in Kenya. On February 28, the 13th MEU (SOC) conducted an amphibious assault onto Somali soil and executed a relief-in-place with UNOSOM forces. By March 2, the withdrawal of all UNOSOM forces was complete, and during the first hours of March 3, the final Marine forces departed Somali soil. The 13th MEU (SOC) returned to Camp Pendleton April 24.
The MEU departed on its ninth deployment April 19, 1996. During an MEU exercise in Kuwait, the MEU became the first MEU(SOC) to put the entire landing force ashore in Kuwait without the use of a port or airfield. This was a vital step in the validation of the plan for the defense of Kuwait, which had previously not been tested.
The “FIghting 13th” returned to Camp Pendleton to end its deployment October 18. The 13th MEU(SOC) began its tenth deployment August 29, 1997. During WESTPAC 98-1, the MEU participated in Operation Southern Watch during November and December, helping enforce the no-fly zone over southern Iraq. The MEU returned home February 28, 11998.
December 5, 1998, began WESTPAC 99-1. During deployment, the MEU conducted training in Hawaii, Singapore and Kuwait. MEU Marines provided reinforcements to the U.S. Embassy in Kenya and responded to the Eritrea-Ethiopia war.
While deployed in the WESTPAC from September 14–16, 2000, the MEU conducted a humanitarian assistance operation in East Timor, offloading more than 570 tons of material by aircraft and more than 430 tons via sea lift.
In October 2000, the 13th MEU was dispatched to provide security and assist in Operation Determined Response, the recovery of the crippled destroyer in the port of Aden, Yemen. The MEU marked its transit home with a stop on Iwo Jima, and Tarawa, returning to Camp Pendleton February 13, 2001.
Global War on Terror.
The “Fighting 13th’s” thirteenth deployment began six weeks early when it departed December 1, 2001, in response to Operation Enduring Freedom being conducted in Afghanistan. Aircraft from HMM-165 (Rein) played an integral part in the air war conducted during Operation Enduring Freedom and provided the primary air support during Operation Anaconda in the early months of 2002. In addition to the 13th MEU (SOC)’s role in Operations Enduring Freedom and Anaconda, the MEU conducted humanitarian assistance operations in Kenya. While in Kenya the MEU built bridges, improved and built school structures, dug a well, and improved structures at a maternity hospital. Medical and dental aid and education were provided to the local population by MEU medical staff and bilateral training was conducted with Kenyan forces. The MEU conducted separate bilateral training exercises with Qatari and Omani forces prior to returning to Camp Pendleton June 17, 2002.

Peter Buck (restaurateur)

Peter Buck (born c. 1930) is a physicist, restaurateur, and philanthropist. He co-founded the Subway fast food restaurant chain.
Education.
A native of South Portland, Maine where he was born circa 1930, Buck graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, in 1952. He then earned master’s and doctoral degrees in physics at Columbia University. In 2008, Bowdoin College awarded him an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.
Subway.
While working as a nuclear physicist for several companies from 1957 to 1978, Buck loaned partner and family friend Fred De Luca $1,000 in 1965 and advised him to open a sandwich shop to help him pay for college at the University of Bridgeport in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They named the restaurant after Buck, calling it "Pete's Super Submarines". Together Buck and De Luca formed Doctor's Associates to oversee operations of the restaurants as the franchise expanded. Though neither the first nor the second restaurants were financial successes, they continued to expand their operations. By 1973, they had 16 locations throughout Connecticut and, in 1974, they began franchising out the restaurants. They also introduced Subway's current logo and changed the name of their operation from what was then "Pete's Subway" to "Subway Sandwiches".
The company reached the height of its success after issuing a marketing campaign starring Jared Fogle in the early 2000s. Subway now has 41,803 franchised locations worldwide, making it the largest quick service restaurant chain in the world.
Philanthropy.
Among Buck's philanthropic works, he donated the Carmen Lucia ruby to the gem collection at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History and gave a grant to Bowdoin College in 2009 that completed its capital campaign. Consequently, the college's new fitness center bears his name.

Randy Holt

Stewart Randall Holt (born January 15, 1953 in Pembroke, Ontario) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who spent 10 seasons in the National Hockey League. Known as one of the toughest players in the sport during his career, he still holds the NHL single-game record for penalty minutes.
Playing career.
After playing his junior hockey with the Sudbury Wolves, Holt was selected 45th overall in the 1973 NHL Amateur Draft by the Chicago Black Hawks. He would spend most of the next four seasons in the Central Hockey League with the Dallas Black Hawks, Chicago's top minor league affiliate, although he was a frequent callup to Chicago, appearing in 42 games over that stretch. He established himself as one of the toughest players in minor pro, recording a CHL record 411 penalty minutes in 1974–75, but also showed a fair amount of skill and was named a CHL First-Team All-Star in 1976 after scoring 52 points from the blueline. 
Just after the start of the 1977–78 season, Holt was dealt to the lowly Cleveland Barons and finally received a chance to stick in the NHL full-time. He finished the season with 1 goal and 5 points in 52 games, along with 249 penalty minutes. At the end of the season, however, the Barons ceased operations and Holt was claimed by the Vancouver Canucks in the resulting dispersal draft. 
Holt appeared in only 22 games for the Canucks before being dealt to the Los Angeles Kings mid-way through the 1978–79 campaign. He finished the season with 1 goal and 9 assists for a career high 10 points, along with 282 penalty minutes, in 58 games between Los Angeles and Vancouver. Included in his penalty total was an NHL record 67 in a March 11, 1979 game against the Philadelphia Flyers. 
After another season in Los Angeles, Holt was traded to the Calgary Flames for the 1980–81 season. He would play some of the best hockey of his career in the 1981 playoffs, recording 2 goals and 4 points in 13 games to help the Flames reach the Stanley Cup semi-finals. For the 1981–82 season, he was dealt to the Washington Capitals, where he would set a club record with 250 penalty minutes. He broke his own record with a league-leading 275 penalty minutes the following season, and also appeared in a career-high 70 games, recording 8 assists. He closed out his career with a 26-game stint for the Philadelphia Flyers in 1983–84 before retiring. 
In 395 NHL games, Holt scored just 4 goals and 37 assists, and amassed 1,438 penalty minutes.
His older brother Gary Holt also played in the NHL during the 1970s.
March 11, 1979.
The toughest player on the Los Angeles Kings, Holt had been acquired mid-way through the 1978–79 season to add muscle to a skilled Kings team, and was expected to be a factor when the team travelled to Philadelphia to face off against the fearsome Flyers. After picking up a minor penalty early in the first period, Holt fought Philadelphia enforcer Frank Bathe at 14:58 of the first period, picking up 20 minutes in penalties. However, Holt felt that he had been a victim of a cheap shot from Flyers' agitator Ken Linseman earlier in the game, and at the end of the first period instigated a bench-clearing brawl in an attempt to settle the score with Linseman. He was assessed a further 45 minutes in penalties for his actions during the brawl, including a triple game misconduct, bringing his game total to 67, shattering the previous NHL record of 52 set by Jim Dorey in 1968. He was also suspended three games by the league for his actions.

The eldest of ten children born to Sardar Battan Singh and Sardarni Swaran Kaur, he was educated at a boarding school in Nairobi. His first work experience was as a spanner boy in his father's garage, and he gained further experience as a mechanic in other organisations before becoming the Royal East African Automobile Association's first patrolman in 1958.
The first Sikh driver ever to win an international rally, and also the first man to win the Safari Rally three times, he was fondly known as the "Flying Sikh" for his exploits behind the wheel. Although Ugandan rival Shekhar Mehta has more outright victories in the event, Singh's record of 19 finishes in 22 attempts is an unprecedented feat of consistency in what has been long regarded as the world's toughest rally, where the attrition rate can exceed 90%. He was even one of the so-called "Unsinkable Seven" – the only crews in the 1968 event who were able to reach the finish at Nairobi when the rest of the entire field of 74 were stranded on the Mau Escarpment along the western rim of the Great Rift Valley.
He had no motorsport experience until he was 26, but made up for his late start by eventually accumulating over sixty wins in the East African Rally Championships in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Aside from his three wins on the Safari Rally, he also scored three top five finishes in the Southern Cross Rally in Australia in the 1970s, and was twice awarded Kenya's Motor Sportsman of the Year title (1970, 1976).
His historic first Safari win in 1965 proved to be a triumph against expectations and a defiance of superstition. It was the 13th running of the event, and his car was given the number 1 which was at that time considered an unlucky number in the Safari. Nevertheless, there was only good fortune for Joginder and Jaswant, despite piloting the same Volvo which factory driver Tom Trana had used in 1963 and 1964 and which had clocked up 42,000 competitive miles on its odometer before the Bhachu brothers' victory.
He spent many years as a resident in the United Kingdom from the 1980s and lived in Canada. He was present as a guest at the opening of the 50th running of the Safari Rally in 2002, and was appointed patron of the Safari Classic for 2007.
Joginder Singh died of heart failure in London on Sunday 20 October 2013, he was aged 81.

Charles Robin

Charles Robin (October 30, 1743 – June 10, 1824) was an entrepreneur from the Isle of Jersey.
He was born in Saint Brélade, Jersey in 1743. By 1763, he was the captain of a ship working in the Newfoundland cod trade. In 1765, with his two brothers and two others, they formed a firm which developed fishing grounds off Cape Breton Island and the Gaspé region. The company sold dried cod to Portugal and Spain, and salmon, furs, and timber to England and Quebec. He brought exiled Acadians from France to work on Cape Breton Island and in the Chaleur Bay region. The operation suffered much damage at the hands of American forces during the American revolution. Robin became partner in a new firm under his own name in 1783. The company advanced merchandise to fisherman against future catches; this resulted in a labour force captive to credit and reduced costs for the company. His connections with the government in Quebec gave him access to the best beach locations near the fishing grounds used to cure the fish.
Robin's fishing and trading operations extended around the Gulf of St. Lawrence region and Arichat. Fishermen on Isle Madame sold all of their fish to Robin, allowing him to control the price. Other merchants at Isle Madame included Valpy dit Janvrin, LeVesconte, de Gruchy, Hubert, Jean, and Moore. Many of these firms continued to exploit Isle Madame's fisheries until well into the twentieth century.
Robin groomed his nephews Philip and James to take over the operation of the company, which remained an important part of the region's economy for the century that followed.
Robin himself was a judge in the Court of Common Pleas, a justice of the peace, and served on the land board for the legal District of Gaspé. In 1802, Robin retired to Jersey. He died in Saint Aubin, Jersey in 1824.

Sumapaz is the 20th locality of Bogotá, capital of Colombia. It is the largest of Bogotá's 20 localities, beginning from the north at the edge of the urban frontier and running south to the Cundinamarca border with Meta and Huila. It is completely rural, with no city services.
History.
The area was an important pilgrimage site for the Muisca indigenous peoples in pre-Columbian times, as the goddess "Bachue" was believed to be submerged in Iguaque lake. In the 16th century, it was discovered by Nicolás de Federman on his journey to El Dorado.
It has been the stage for several rural conflicts, including those of 1928 and 1946. La Violencia of 1948 gave rise to the formation of the guerilla groups still present in Colombia. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Colombian army took the territory from guerilla hands as part of a counter-guerilla strategy of President Álvaro Uribe.
Economy.
The population is dependent on small-scale farming and livestock.

Milecastle 50

Milecastle 50 (High House) was a milecastle on Hadrian's Wall ().
Description.
Milecastle 50 is situated to the west of Birdoswald fort. It lies 1391 metres west of Milecastle 49 and 1501 metres east of Milecastle 51. Very little can be seen on the ground other than a ploughed-down earth platform.
Excavations.
The milecastle was excavated in 1911. Excavation showed that it measures 18.3 metres east to west by 23.2 metres north to south. It is built with narrow gauge defensive walls, which are bonded into the Narrow Wall curtain of Hadrian's Wall on either side. It has Type III gateways. 
The stone milecastle replaced its predecessor, Milecastle 50TW (High House) on the Turf Wall, some 200 metres to the south (). It is the only Turf Wall milecastle without a Stone Wall successor on it. Milecastle 50TW was excavated by F. G. Simpson and I. A. Richmond in 1934. It had turf defensive walls, a timber north tower, and a fragment of a timber construction inscription was recovered recording its construction under Aulus Platorius Nepos.
Associated Turrets.
Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 50 are known as Turret 50A and Turret 50B.
Turret 50A.
Turret 50A (High House) () was excavated in 1911. The north half of the turret is buried beneath the road, and the south half survives as a slight earthwork at the edge of the adjoining field. It replaced the earlier turf wall turret (50A TW; ) which was dismantled when the stone wall was built. 
Turret 50B.
Turret 50B (Appletree) () was also excavated in 1911. There are no surface remains visible, but a distinct rise in the south wall of the road marks the point in which it is carried over the south wall of the turret. It replaced the earlier turf wall turret (50B TW; ) which was dismantled when the stone wall was built.

<doc id="5852731" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5852731" title="System image">
System image

In computing, a system image is a copy of the entire state of a computer system stored in some non-volatile form such as a file. A system is said to be capable of using system images if it can be shut down and later restored to exactly the same state. In such cases, system images can be used for backup.
Hibernation is an example that uses an image of the entire machine's RAM.
Disk images.
If a system has all its state written to a disk, then a system image can be produced by simply copying that disk to a file elsewhere, often with disk cloning applications. On many systems a complete system image cannot be created by a disk cloning program running within that system because information can be held outside of disks and volatile memory, for example in non-volatile memory like boot ROMs.
Process images.
A process image is a copy of its state at a given point in time. It is often used for persistence. A common example is a database management system (DBMS). Most DBMS can store the state of its database or databases to a file before being closed down (see database dump). The DBMS can then be restarted later with the information in the database intact and proceed as though the software had never stopped. Another example would be the hibernate feature of many operating systems. Here, the state of all RAM memory is stored to disk, the computer is brought into an energy saving mode, then later restored to normal operation.
Some emulators provide a facility to save an image of the system being emulated. This is often called a savestate.
Programming language support.
Some programming languages provide a command to take a system image of a program. This is normally a standard feature in Smalltalk (inspired by FLEX) and Lisp, among other languages. Development in these languages is often quite different from many other programming languages. For example in Lisp the programmer may load packages or other code into a running Lisp implementation using the read-eval-print loop, which usually compiles the programs. Data is loaded into the running Lisp system. The programmer may then dump a system image, containing that pre-compiled and possibly customized code - and also all loaded application data.
Often this image is an executable, and can be run on other machines. This system image can be the form in which executable programs are distributed — this method has often been used by programs (such as TeX and Emacs) largely implemented in Lisp, Smalltalk, or idiosyncratic languages to avoid spending time repeating the same initialization work every time they start up.
Similar, Lisp Machines were booted from Lisp images, called Worlds. The World contains the complete operating system, its applications and its data in a single file. It was also possible to save incremental Worlds, that contain only the changes from some base World. Before saving the World, the Lisp Machine operating system could optimize the contents of memory (better memory layout, compacting data structures, sorting data, ...).
Although its purpose is different, a "system image" is often similar in structure to a core dump.

I Malavoglia

I Malavoglia is the best known novel by Giovanni Verga. It was first printed in 1881. An English edition, The House by the Medlar-Tree (1890) translated by Mary A. Craig was published in the Continental Classics series.
This work belongs to the "Ciclo dei vinti", together with "Mastro-don Gesualdo", and "La Duchessa di Leyra", "L'Onorevole Scipioni" and "L'uomo di lusso", works which deal with the problem of social and economical advancement. "La Duchessa de Leyra" remained only a draft, while the last two novels planned for the "Ciclo", "L'Onorevole Scipioni" and "L'Uomo di Lusso", were not even started.
"I Malavoglia" deals with a family of fishermen who work and live in Aci Trezza, a small Sicilian village near Catania. The novel possesses a choral aspect, and depicts characters united by the same culture, but divided by ancient rivalries.
Verga adopts the impersonality technique, reproducing some features of the dialect and adapting himself to the point of view of the characters. In doing so, he renounces the customary mediation of the narrator.
A film, based on the story of "I Malavoglia", "La Terra Trema" (), was directed by Luchino Visconti in 1948. In the book by Silvia Iannello "Le immagini e le parole dei Malavoglia" (Sovera, Roma, 2008) the author selects some passages of the Verga novel "I Malavoglia", adds original comments and Acitrezza's photographic images, and devotes a chapter to the origins, remarks and frames taken from the film "La terra trema".
Summary.
In the village of Aci Trezza in the Province of Catania lives the Toscano family, who, although extremely hardworking, has been nicknamed (for antiphrasis) the "Malavoglia" (The Reluctant Ones). The head of the family is Padron Ntoni, a widower, who lives at the house by the medlar tree with his son Bastian (called Bastianazzo, despite his being anything but tall), and the wife of the latter called Maria (nicknamed Maruzza la Longa). Bastian has five children: Ntoni, Luca, Filomena (Mena), Alessio (called Alessi) and Rosalia (Lia). The main source of income is "la Provvidenza" (the Providence), which is a small fishing boat. In 1863, Ntoni, the eldest of the children, leaves for the military service. To try and make up for the loss of income which his absence will cause, Padron Ntoni attempts a business venture and buys a large amount of lupins. The load is entrusted to his son Bastianazzo, the plan being to sell them in Riposto to make a profit. However, Bastianazzo and the merchandise are tragically lost during a storm. Following this misfortune, the family finds themselves with a triple misfortune: the debt caused by the lupins which were bought on credit, the Providence to repair, and the loss of Bastianazzo, an important and loved member of the family. Having finished his military service, Ntoni returns to the laborious life of his family very reluctantly, having seen the riches and splendour outside his small village, and does not represent any support to the already precarious economic situation of his family.
The family’s misfortunes are far from over. Luca, one of Padron Ntoni’s grandsons, dies at the battle of Lissa (1866), which leads to the breaking off of the betrothal of Mena to Brasi Cipolla. The debt from the lupin venture causes the family to lose their beloved “Casa del Nespolo” – the house by the medlar tree, and gradually the reputation of the family worsens until they reach humiliating levels of poverty. A further wreck of the Providence leaves Padron Ntoni near death, although fortunately he manages to recover. Later Maruzza, his daughter-in-law, dies of cholera. The firstborn, Ntoni, decides to go away from the village to seek his fortune, only to return destitute. He loses any desire to work, turning to alcoholism and idleness. The departure of Ntoni had forced the family to sell the Providence to get the money needed to get back the Casa del Nespolo, which had never been forgotten. 
The mistress of the osteria, Santuzza, who is already coveted by the sharkish Don Michele, becomes infatuated with Ntoni, serving him for free in the tavern. The conduct of Ntoni and the lamentations of his father convince her to turn her emotions from him, and to return to Don Michele. This leads to a brawl between the two; a brawl that results in the stabbing of Don Michele in the chest by Ntoni during an anti-smuggling raid. Ntoni ends up in prison. At his trial, after hearing rumours about a relationship between Don Michele and his granddaughter Lia, Padron Ntoni passes out and falls to the ground. Now old, his conversation is disjointed and he recites his proverbs without much awareness of what is going on. Lia, the younger sister, becomes the victim of vicious village gossip, runs away and becomes a prostitute. Mena, because of the shameful situation of her sister, feels that she cannot marry Alfio, even though they love each other, and instead remains at home to care for Alessi and Nunziata’s children. Alessi, the youngest of the brothers, has remained a fisherman and with hard work manages to rebuild the family fortunes to the point at which they can repurchase the house by the medlar tree. Having bought the house, what is left of the family visits the hospital where the old Padron Ntoni is being kept, to inform him of the good news and to announce his imminent return home. It is the last moment of happiness for the old man, who dies on the day he was to return. Even his desire to die in the house where was born is never granted. When Ntoni is released from prison and comes back to the village, he realises that he cannot stay because of all that he has done. He has excluded himself from his family by systematically denouncing their values.

Armchair Cricket

Armchair cricket is a card game that is inspired by the bat and ball sport cricket. It is played by either two or four people. Depending on the version of the game being played, a game can last a few minutes to several hours. It was produced commercially in England but is no longer made (although unused sets are still available for sale by private and specialist traders).
The Cards.
The game is not played with a standard deck of playing cards. Two identical decks of 55 cards, comprising five suits of 11, are used instead (the 110 cards together are referred to as a pack). The suits are named after important pieces of cricketing equipment – bats, balls, stumps, gloves and pads – and numbered simply 1 to 11. The cards numbered 1 are called ‘dollies’ (cricketing slang for an easy catch) and those numbered 11 are called ‘beauts’ (presumably referring to excellent deliveries or shots).
Basic Gameplay.
In the two player game, both players hold six cards, unseen by their opponent (one player may hold seven or eight cards as a way of evening up the odds where there is a wide difference in ability). One player will be ‘bowling’ and the other ‘batting’. The bowler plays a card – corresponding to bowling a delivery – and the batsman (or batter) responds by playing a card – corresponding to playing a shot. Depending on the cards, the outcome may be runs for the batsman or a wicket to the bowler (or, of course, a dot ball).
Different Versions.
There are a number of versions of the game, which allow for games of varying length and intensity to be played.
Quicket.
This is a fast, simple version, which might be thought of as an equivalent to ‘French cricket’. Only four of the five suits are used, and once the pack has been exhausted an innings is over (since there are 88 cards in this pack and a delivery requires a card to be played by both players, the maximum length of a Quicket innings is 44 balls). The standard way to play this version is for the innings to end immediately if a wicket falls.
Limited Overs.
Just as in cricket, with one innings per team, innings ending with the fall of ten wickets or after the allotted overs have been bowled. When a pack is exhausted, the cards that have been played (the discard pile) are turned face down, shuffled and reused.
Full Cricket.
Each team has two innings, with scores aggregated to determine the victor. Instead of the match length being determined by counting overs, it is done by counting how often packs are exhausted – players can think of a pack as representing half an hour of play. So, for instance, playing a five day Test match involves 30 ‘hours’ of play, and so the pack needs to be exhausted 60 times.
Rules.
When the batsman is faced with a delivery, he or she will be out by playing a card that is different in suit and lower in value. To score runs he or she needs to play a card that is in the same suit and higher in value. (Anything else is a dot ball.) The number of runs is determined by the difference in value. Roughly, if the batsman’s card exceeds the bowler’s by 1, 2 or 3, one run is scored; if by 4 or 5, two runs; if by 6, three runs; if by 7, 8, 9, four runs; if by 10, six runs. (So the only way to score a six is to play a beaut on a dolly.) There are some complications if other rules are being played, especially the two-card shot.
The manufacturer says that with this basic rule, a game can be played but the scores will be unrealistically low (compared to real cricket). There are a number of rules, which are best introduced gradually, which make the game more and more realistic (and require more sophisticated thinking from the players).
The most important are the no-ball rule, the extras, lower-order batsmen and the two-card shot.
No-ball rule.
Playing the basic rule only soon reveals that bowling is too easy (or batting is too difficult). The no-ball rule redresses this by reducing the number of cards that the bowler is allowed to use. Every over there is a no-ball suit, determined by the suit used by the bowler in the last delivery of the previous over. If a bowler plays a card in the no-ball suit then the batsman automatically gets a run, and is entitled to play any card without penalty. The bowler has to bowl an extra delivery. In fact, Armchair Cricket played simply with the no-ball rule is a challenging game and reasonable simulation of cricket already.
The extras.
These are more restrictions on the bowler. If the bowler bowls a card equal in value to the last card played then a wide is called, runs added to the batsman and the ball has to be bowled again. If, instead, the bowler’s card exceeds the last card played by one, then byes are called (the number of byes or wides depends on the value of the bowler’s card). The other extra from real cricket, the leg bye, is a feature of the two card shot.
Lower-order batsmen.
To simulate the fact that in real cricket some batsmen are worse than others, there are restrictions on the cards the batsman is allowed to use when the lower order batsmen are in play. Specifically, there are no extra restrictions on the first five batsmen, then the next three are not allowed to use dollies to defend a higher card in the same suit, and the last three batsmen cannot use dollies or twos to defend higher cards. There is no similar way of simulating different bowlers’ abilities.
The two-card shot.
This is a relatively complicated procedure, whereby the batsman plays two cards in response to the bowler’s delivery, and forces the bowler to play another card, called the fielding card. With the two-card shot rule in place, Armchair Cricket can simulate several more features of the real game, including run outs, overthrows, out obstructing the field, out hit the ball twice and scrambled singles (called suicide singles).
Four player games.
There are some differences in the four player game, where players play in pairs. The major differences are that for the batting side, each player holds seven cards not six, and represents one of the batsmen for the duration of that batsman’s innings, whereas the two players on the bowling side always alternate overs. So in the course of one over a bowler may well bowl to both his or her opponents.
Keeping score.
Because of the game’s attempt to simulate real cricket so closely, players tend to keep score in much the same way as real cricket scorers do, performing the so-called ball by ball analysis onto a specially prepared scoring pad. In this way, individual batsmen’s and bowler’s performances can be given (e.g. scoring rate, number of runs conceded etc.). However, this is not vital for determining the result of the game. The bare minimum is to know how many balls have been bowled in the over, how far the game has progressed (in terms of overs or packs), the team’s score, and which individual batsman is facing any particular delivery (if players are playing the lower-order batsmen rule). In the Quicket version, all that’s needed is to keep track of the team’s score, and (as suggested in the game’s documentation) players can use the unused suit to display the score.
Skill and luck.
Although there is an element of luck in a game where you pick up cards face down from a shuffled deck, Armchair Cricket is a game of skill, and it is interesting to consider to what extent real cricketing knowledge and experience is useful in playing the game. Perhaps experience in how to pace an innings, especially in the limited overs version, is a relevant skill. The right time to make a declaration in the two innings version may be another example.
Realism.
Bearing in mind the complicated nature of real cricket, in its technical details, Armchair Cricket does a remarkable job of simulating the game. There are many details which can be ignored by the players without affecting the game, or instead savoured by cricket fans who enjoy these details. For example, the precise values of the cards played allow players to distinguish between dot balls that are (i) defensive shots where the bat struck the ball, (ii) ‘leaves’ where the batsman deliberately does not strike the ball, and (iii) instances where the ball has ‘beaten the bat’ without taking a wicket. Whichever of these three possibilities is the case makes no substantial difference to the game, but the detail is there nevertheless for those who wish to know. Similarly, when a wicket falls there is a procedure for determining how the batsman was out (deciding between bowled, LBW, caught out etc.), but ultimately, the nature of the dismissal is irrelevant to the outcome of the game.
Factors that are not simulated.
There are, of course, some aspects of the real game of cricket which are not simulated in Armchair Cricket, which players may like to think about how to incorporate into their house rules.
Weather.
Rain does not stop play in Armchair Cricket, nor will umpires offer the batting team bad light!
Pitch conditions.
Perhaps the most serious missing aspect is there is no simulation of pitch conditions. The rule book describes the act of looking at your cards at the start of the game after winning the toss as inspecting the pitch’, but unless you get to see your opponent’s hand as well, this is not that realistic. The most serious drawback is that in a long two innings game, where traditionally the team batting last suffers on a deteriorating pitch, there is no real reason why in Armchair Cricket the fourth innings is any harder for the batting team than the previous three. Perhaps you could adapt the lower-order batsmen rule to make it harder in the latter stages of a game?
Bowler styles.
In real cricket, the bowler styles are varied and important, but there is no appreciable difference in the card game between a fast bowler, a wristy leg-spinner or a swing-and-seam merchant. (There is a very minor differentiation, which is that when a bowler takes a wicket that is caught behind, the bowler can decide it was a stumping if the bowler was a spinner.) This all ties up with earlier problems regarding weather and pitch conditions. One can imagine a complicated refinement to the rules where fast bowlers on bouncy pitches in sunny weather have the odds stacked slightly in their favour, or spinners have an advantage when bowling to left-handers in the fifth day of a test, but it would need a lot of playtesting and perhaps would not add much to the game.
Setting the field.
An important role played by the captain of the fielding side in cricket is deciding where each of your teammates should stand - this affects the bowler's behaviour, how easy it is for the batsman to score runs, how risky certain shots are etc. There is no way of simualting this in Armchair Cricket, except to say that it falls under the general concept of how aggressively the bowler is bowling.
Fatigue.
Similarly to how the pitch does not deteriorate in Armchair Cricket, bowlers do not get tired (although they do benefit from resting during the intervals!). Nothing stops the bowling team using the same two bowlers for the entire duration of a Test match. When to deploy one’s bowlers is a crucial part of the captain’s role in real cricket, but is irrelevant in Armchair Cricket.

Grothendieck connection

In algebraic geometry and synthetic differential geometry, a Grothendieck connection is a way of viewing connections in terms of descent data from infinitesimal neighbourhoods of the diagonal.
Introduction and motivation.
The Grothendieck connection is a generalization of the Gauss-Manin connection constructed in a manner analogous to that in which the Ehresmann connection generalizes the Koszul connection. The construction itself must satisfy a requirement of "geometric invariance", which may be regarded as the analog of covariance for a wider class of structures including the schemes of algebraic geometry. Thus the connection in a certain sense must live in a natural sheaf on a Grothendieck topology. In this section, we discuss how to describe an Ehresmann connection in sheaf-theoretic terms as a Grothendieck connection.
Let "M" be a manifold and π : "E" → "M" a surjective submersion, so that "E" is a manifold fibred over "M". Let J1("M","E") be the first-order jet bundle of sections of "E". This may be regarded as a bundle over "M" or a bundle over the total space of "E". With the latter interpretation, an Ehresmann connection is a section of the bundle (over "E") J1("M","E") → "E". The problem is thus to obtain an intrinsic description of the sheaf of sections of this vector bundle.
Grothendieck's solution is to consider the diagonal embedding Δ : "M" → "M" × "M". The sheaf "I" of ideals of Δ in "M" × "M" consists of functions on "M" × "M" which vanish along the diagonal. Much of the infinitesimal geometry of "M" can be realized in terms of "I". For instance, Δ* ("I"/"I"2) is the sheaf of sections of the cotangent bundle. One may define a "first-order infinitesimal neighborhood" "M"(2) of Δ in "M" × "M" to be the subscheme corresponding to the sheaf of ideals "I"2. (See below for a coordinate description.) 
There are a pair of projections "p"1, "p"2 : "M" × "M" → "M" given by projection the respective factors of the Cartesian product, which restrict to give projections "p"1, "p"2 : "M"(2) → "M". One may now form the pullback of the fibre space "E" along one or the other of "p"1 or "p"2. In general, there is no canonical way to identify "p"1*"E" and "p"2*"E" with each other. A Grothendieck connection is a specified isomorphism between these two spaces.

Milecastle 51

Milecastle 51 (Wall Bowers) was a milecastle on Hadrian's Wall ().
Description.
Milecastle 51 is situated to the west of Birdoswald fort (), at the point where the Stone Wall rejoins the line of the Turf Wall. It lies 1501m west of Milecastle 50 and 1484m east of Milecastle 52. The remains are in poor condition, consisting of turf covered foundations with traces of a ditch to the east.
Excavations.
The milecastle was excavated in 1927, 1934 and 1936. Although not now visible, excavation showed that it had two internal stone barracks buildings. It had Type III gateways.
The stone milecastle replaced its underlying predecessor, Milecastle 51TW, on the Turf Wall.
Associated Turrets.
Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 51 are known as Turret 51A and Turret 51B.
Turret 51A.
Turret 51A (Piper Sike) () is of the type normally associated with the Turf Wall, and later replaced in stone. The turret was excavated in 1927 and again in 1970. The entrance was on the east side and a substantial platform against the north wall. Cooking hearths and rubbish were found spread over the rest of the turret. Occupation is not believed to have continued later than the 2nd century AD. The turret was consolidated after 1970 and survives to a maximum height of 0.8 metres.
Turret 51B.
Turret 51B (Leahill) () measures 4.1 by 4.3 metres. It was excavated in 1927 and again in 1958. It replaced the earlier Turf Wall turret. The stone turret has been consolidated and survives to a maximum height of 1.1 metres.

Prouts Neck

Prouts Neck is a peninsula in the town of Scarborough, Maine, in the United States. Prouts Neck first appears on a map by Samuel de Champlain from his 1604 explorations of New England. In early times it was known as Black Point because of the dark appearance of its forests. Captain Thomas Cammock, a nephew of the Earl of Warwick was the first European settler of what is now called Prouts Neck. In 1631, he was granted an area of about 1500 acres by the Plymouth Council for New England which had jurisdiction, granted by the King, over all of New England. Ownership passed through several early families and settled for a time with Timothy Prout, a Boston merchant, who lived there from 1728 to 1768. The name Prout’s Neck became well established, but by 1830 the Libby family had purchased most of the Neck and the name became Libby’s Neck till the late 1870s, by which time most of the Libby land had been sold off to members of the growing summer community and the name reverted to Prouts Neck (more often written without the apostrophe). Prouts Neck is known also for artist Winslow Homer (1836–1910), whose studio overlooking Cannon Rock is a National Historic Landmark.
Prouts Neck, or just "Prouts" to residents, is a mostly seasonal summer community. The neck itself is not completely gated, but it is well patrolled by local police. The peninsula is almost completely built out, meaning that existing houses sell for a significant premium, and land for new ones is difficult to come by. There are a number of antique summer "cottages" that have been in families for generations, several of which were designed by noted architect John Calvin Stevens. These cottages are unique in that many have not changed for well over one hundred years, presenting an interesting view of a bygone era. Although there were once many hotels on Prouts Neck, including the Jocelyn, and most notably the Checkley, the only one that remains is the august and venerable Black Point Inn, which has recently undergone a complete renovation designed by Gawron Turgeon Architects and is open to the public on a seasonal basis.
The Prouts Neck Country Club (PNCC), established in 1907, is a private country club with an 18 hole golf course, putting green, driving range, tennis courts, golf shop, tennis pro shop, and clubhouse with an outstanding staff. Membership is restricted to residents of the neck and their guests.
The Prouts Neck Bathing Association (PNBA) is responsible for maintenance and regulation of the private Beach Club.
The Prouts Neck Yacht Club (PNYC) is located on the southwestern corner of the peninsula, also known as Western Point. The club conducts sailing classes for children from age 6-17 as well as classes for adults. The club operates moorings for both powerboats and sailboats. The club owns a fleet of 420s, a fleet of Prams, a few Optimists and a fleet of about 8 Sonars. Prouts Neck Yacht Club has adult Sonar races weekly as well as 2 inter-club regattas each summer, (one in August, one in July), both called the Golden Cleat Regatta.
Famous families that have summered in Prouts Neck for generations include members of the Rockefeller family, descendants of Andrew Carnegie and more. Other famous residents include NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and actress Glenn Close.

Late Egyptian language

Late Egyptian is the stage of the Egyptian language that was written by the time of the New Kingdom around 1350 BC – the Amarna period. Texts written wholly in Late Egyptian date to the Ramesside Period and later. Late Egyptian succeeded but did not fully supplant Middle Egyptian as a literary language.
Late Egyptian literature.
Late Egyptian is represented by a large body of religious and secular literature, comprising such examples as the "Story of Wenamun", the love poems of the Chester–Beatty I papyrus, and the "Instruction of Any". Instructions became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom, which took the form of advice on proper behavior. It was also the language of the Ramesside administration.
Differences between Middle and Late Egyptian.
Late Egyptian is not completely distinct from Middle Egyptian, as many "classicisms" appear in historical and literary documents of this phase. However, the difference between Middle and Late Egyptian is greater than the one between Middle and Old Egyptian: from being a synthetic it became an analytic language. Their relationship has been described as being similar to that of Latin and Italian. 
Developments during the first millennium BC.
Hieroglyphic orthography saw an enormous expansion of its graphemic inventory between the Late Dynastic and Ptolemaic periods. 
Middle Egyptian had a renaissance after the Third Intermediate Period, when it was often used in hieroglyphic and hieratic texts in preference to Late Egyptian.

Robbie Herrera

Roberto Herrera (born 12 June 1970) is an English former professional footballer. He played as a left-back and is currently College Co-ordinator at Torquay United as part of the club's youth development link with Paignton Community and Sports College.
Career.
Herrera, although born and raised in Torquay, South Devon and registered as a schoolboy with his local side Torquay United, began his career as an apprentice with Queens Park Rangers, turning professional on 1 March 1988. His league debut came as a substitute on 14 January 1989 in an away defeat against Wimbledon, but future appearances proved to be hard to come by.
Herrera returned to Torquay United on loan on 17 March 1992, playing 11 league games. A further loan spell at Plainmoor followed on 24 October 1992, Herrera returning to the QPR reserves after 5 games. On 29 October 1993, he made the short move from Loftus Road to Fulham, where he eventually made 144 league appearances, scoring twice. After helping Fulham to promotion from Division 3 in 1997, Herrera lost his place to former QPR colleague Rufus Brevett, as the ambitions of their owner Mohamed Al Fayed became apparent, ambitions that would see the London side in the Premiership within 4 years.
The situation surrounding Herrera's move to Fulham was a unique one. During a time of financial frailty for Fulham, chairman Jimmy Hill came out in front of the crowd and said that they had identified a full back from Queens Park Rangers who he and the manager thought would improve the team. Hill asked that Fulham fans contribute what they can towards the £60,000 for the signing of this full back and the following game Herrera was paraded in front of the crowd with the rumour being that filmstar Hugh Grant had stumped up the transfer fee.
On 4 August 1998, he signed for Torquay for a fee of £30,000, his solid defending and quick attacking instincts helping to establish him in the team. However, a recurring groin injury caused him to miss games, and during the 2000–01 season he found it difficult to sustain himself as a first team regular, not playing at all after 31 March. Although his form was not good, he was played as a wing-back by Wes Saunders, and not in his natural full-back position. It was little surprise that Herrera was one of the three players released at the end of the 2000–01 season. He had played 104 league games, scoring one goal against Rochdale, in his third spell at the club.
Surprisingly, given his poor showing the previous season, Herrera was invited back to Plainmoor on trial by new manager Roy McFarland, playing in the 2–0 win away to Newton Abbot on 25 July 2001. On 8 August he signed a 3-month contract, and played in the opening game of the season away to Bristol Rovers. Two further appearances followed, but he then slipped out of the reckoning and was released on 17 September.
He joined Leyton Orient on trial on 1 October, signing a one-month contract 2 days later as manager Tommy Taylor wanted cover for the injured Matthew Lockwood. Taylor was sacked soon after, but Herrera impressed new manager Paul Brush enough to earn a second month's contract beginning on 5 November, despite being out with first a back injury and then a toe injury. He was released by Orient later that month and joined non-league Grays Athletic.
In December 2005, Herrera joined Leroy Rosenior's Merthyr Tydfil, moving on to Taunton Town, managed by former Torquay player Russell Musker in August 2002. He left Taunton in the summer of 2003 to join Bideford, managed by another former Torquay player Sean William Joyce.
In March 2006 he joined another North Devon side Torrington, taking over as player-manager the following month. Herrera resigned in February 2007 after a 7–0 defeat against Melksham Town, and returned to Bideford as a player only.
Since ending his professional playing career, Herrera has worked with Torquay United's youth team, and has held coaching positions as well as being the club's College Co-Ordinator. In September 2009, following United winger Saul Halpin's graduation to the first team, then-chief executive Colin Lee hailed Herrera's contribution to the college scheme, saying "Robbie has done a fantastic job, and he's been a big reason for the course's success on the football side." As part of his involvement with Torquay's youth team, Herrera has also occasionally refereed matches between their U-18s and the youth sides of other clubs.

David of Augsburg

David of Augsburg (early 13th century – 19 November 1272) was a medieval German mystic, and a Franciscan friar. It is believed that he probably joined the Franciscan Order at Regensburg. He was the master of novices in the Franciscan houses at Regensburg and Augsburg. He wrote the acclaimed ""Formula Novitiorum"".
His major work, written in the 1240s, is entitled "The Composition of the Interior and Exterior Man according to the Triple states of Beginners, Proficient, and Perfect". It is composed of three different treatises whose dates and relationships are difficult to determine. It was clearly popular, since close to 400 manuscripts of the whole or parts survive, along with numerous translations.
He also composed various vernacular texts in Middle High German (24 are known, though at times doubt has been cast on the veracity of the attribution). The most notable of these are "The Seven Stages of Prayer", and "Concerning the Manifestation and Salvation of the Human Race".

15th Marine Expeditionary Unit

The 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (15th MEU) is one of seven Marine Expeditionary Units currently in existence in the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) with a strength of about 2,200 personnel. The MEU consists of a command element, a reinforced infantry battalion, a composite helicopter squadron and a combat logistics battalion. The 15th MEU is currently based out of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California.
Mission.
The mission of the MEU is to provide geographic combatant commanders with a forward-deployed, rapid-response force capable of conducting conventional amphibious and selected maritime special operations at night or under adverse weather conditions from the sea, by surface and/or by air while under communications and electronics restrictions.
History.
Early years.
In April 1983, the Commandant of the Marine Corps approved the original Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Headquarters concept, providing for the sourcing of two Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) headquarters from each Marine Amphibious Brigade headquarters. The Commandant directed the establishment of two additional MAU headquarters in November 1985. As a result, the Headquarters, 15th Marine Amphibious Unit was activated 1 July 1987 at Camp Pendleton.
The Commandant directed the replacement of the title "Headquarters" with "Command Element" in the titles of the MAGTFs in August 1987. The 15th MAU’s designation was further changed in February 1988 to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Both changes were made to more accurately reflect the operational and expeditionary nature of the MAGTF. Before World War II, and in the period between then and the Vietnam War, Marine units dispatched for overseas service were generally designated as “expeditionary brigades."
Since its activation in July 1987, the 15th MEU has trained to meet its mission in the rotation with the 11th and 13th MEUs to provide a continuous presence in the Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf and as a ready MAGTF in the continental United States.
In October 1989, the MEU assisted in relief efforts following the San Francisco earthquake, performing their assigned missions and also taking on several volunteer projects to help the victims of the disaster.
1990s.
Marines of the 15th MEU relieved the 1st Battalion, 24th Marines (1/24, 4th Marine Division) to continue the evacuation of the Republic of the Philippines in August 1991 after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo that had occurred six weeks earlier. Assistance lasted over a month as the Marines distributed food and medical supplies, evacuated stranded villagers and provided security to other rescue personnel.
The MEU spearheaded Operation Restore Hope on 9 December 1992, to provide humanitarian assistance to the civil war torn and famine-stricken country of Somalia. After a predawn landing, the Marines secured the capital city of Mogadishu, the international airport and maritime shipping port facilities, as well as the American Embassy, and quickly moved into other inland areas to protect food distribution convoys and patrol the streets to restore order. The MEU pushed into and secured the inland cities of Baidoa and Balidogle and the coastal town of Kismayo in order to establish relief efforts and maintain security. The span of operations for the Battalion Landing Team was over .
During its deployment in 1994, the MEU provided a detachment of CH-53Es to assist in the Rwanda Relief Effort. The detachment, based in Entebbe, Uganda, provided the only heavy lift capability to the joint task force commander. A few weeks later the MEU assisted in the relocation of the United States Liaison Office from Mogadishu, Somalia, to Nairobi, Kenya.
In October 1994, the MEU was called on again to provide a quick reaction force to counter any possible Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Within 48 hours, the MEU sent Marines ashore in Kuwait City to demonstrate U.S. resolve in maintaining peace and security in the area.
In January 1996, July 1997, and October 1998, AV-8B Harriers from the 15th MEU (SOC) participated in Operation Southern Watch, patrolling the No-fly zone over southern Iraq maintaining continuous surveillance of the Kuwait-Iraq border, and to ensure the Iraqi military did not violate any United Nations resolutions passed since the Gulf War.
During its 2000 deployment, the 15th MEU (SOC) also participated in the Australian-led Operation Stabilise, providing desperately needed assistance to the people of East Timor, and again patrolled the skies over Southern Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch.
Global War on Terror.
Marines of the Forward Command Element of the 15th MEU (SOC) were in East Timor readying for the arrival of the ARG to conduct Humanitarian Operations, while the ARG was in Darwin, Australia during the September 2001 terror attacks on the United States. Following the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the 15th MEU (SOC) continued their plans of humanitarian operations to assist the war-torn country of East Timor, before sailing to the North Arabian Sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
On 7 October 2001, the 15th MEU participated in the United States' new "War on Terrorism," sending Marines and Sailors into Northern Pakistan to establish a forward operating air base and logistical hub. These Marines provided security to USAF personnel who arrived on location shortly after the 15th MEU Marines of Battalion Landing Team 1/1 had established security.
On 25 November 2001, the Marines and Sailors of the 15th MEU (SOC) conducted an Amphibious assault over into the land-locked country of Afghanistan. The Marines and Sailors set new standards for Marine Corps amphibious doctrine. Landing at a remote airbase, southwest of Kandahar, the Marines occupied Camp Rhino that had been secured by the U.S. Army special forces, America's first Forward Operating Base while maintaining the first significant conventional ground presence in Afghanistan. The Marines and coalition forces later moved north to Kandahar International Airport securing a new forward operating base. With the move, the Marines and coalition forces were able to continue with new missions and build a prison camp that housed numerous Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters.
On 6 January 2003, this time on board the ARG, the 15th MEU (SOC) departed once again for another deployment. In mid-February, elements of the MEU off-loaded and established a training camp in Northern Kuwait while other members of the MAGTF – primarily the helicopter squadron – remained on board the Tarawa ARG in the Persian Gulf.
During February and March 2003, tactical control (TACON) of the MEU was assigned to the United Kingdom's 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines for Operation Iraqi Freedom. On 21 March 2003, Marines from the 15th MEU crossed the border into Southern Iraq and secured the ports of Umm Qasr and Az Zubayr in order to destroy Iraqi resistance and enable follow-on humanitarian assistance to begin.
In late-March 2003, the MEU again became part of the I Marine Expeditionary Force and moved to An Nasiriyah, Iraq to relieve the Marines of Task Force Tarawa. In An Nasiriyah, the 15th MEU secured the remaining sectors of the city, conducted a supporting attack during the rescue of American Prisoner of war Jessica Lynch and continued to establish security throughout the greater An Nasiriyah area. The MEU provided humanitarian assistance to the local population that included purifying drinking water, and doctors and corpsmen assisted medical care. The MEU began helping establish the local government to include police and other local services in addition to continuing to conduct airborne surveillance and direct-action raids on the ground to seek out and capture any Ba’ath Party or Fedayeen resistance.
In January 2005, the 15th MEU participated in Operation Unified Assistance by providing disaster relief to survivors of the massive tsunami in Sumatra, Indonesia and southern Sri Lanka. Immediately after wrapping up those operations, the 15th MEU proceeded south of Baghdad, Iraq to Forward Operating Base Falcon near Al-Mahmudiyah, Babil province, south of for security and stability operations in between rotations of army units. Their deployment into Iraq lasted about 30 days.
On 13 September 2006, the 15th MEU was once again deployed to Iraq. It left San Diego on the , , and and in mid November began operating in Al Anbar province as Task Force Bullrush, composed of elements of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable); Bravo Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion; C Company, 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, and Alpha Company, 3rd Platoon, 1st Combat Engineer Battalion.
On 11 February 2007, the unit received notice of its second extension of their deployment in support of President Bush's surge of additional forces into the critical areas of Iraq. While operating in Al Anbar, the MEU conducted combat operations in Rutbah, Barwana, Haditha, Haqlaniyah, Ramadi and Al Asad in support of Multinational Force-West. The unit returned to San Diego on 30 May 2007.
On 5 May 2008, the unit was deployed on a sea deployment to the Western Pacific & the Persian Gulf, aboard the USS Peleliu, USS Dubuque, and the USS Pearl Harbor. 
On 17 September 2012, the 15th MEU was deployed with the Peleliu Amphibious Ready Group (USS Peleliu, USS Greenbay, and the USS Rushmore) as a theater reserve and crisis response force throughout the U.S. Central Command and the U.S. 5th Fleet area of responsibility. The unit returned to Camp Pendleton 13 May 2013.

Hesperosuchus

Hesperosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodylomorph reptile that contains a single species, "Hesperosuchus agilis". Remains of this sphenosuchian have been found in Late Triassic (Carnian) strata from Arizona and New Mexico.
"Hesperosuchus" was a contemporary of "Coelophysis", a primitive predatory theropod dinosaur. "Coelophysis" was long thought to have been a cannibal, based on the presence of putative juvenile "Coelophysis" bones in the gut regions of a few adults. In at least one of these cases, though, the "juvenile "Coelophysis"" bones were actually those of a "Hesperosuchus" (or something very similar) instead.

In 1996 Reggie became the front man for soul, rock, and hip hop group Maktub. While touring in the earlier years with the Wayne Horvitz 4+1 Ensemble, Watts was forced to downsize his effects pedal from a Roland Space Echo tape delay to a Line 6 DL4 delay modeler, a smaller device that makes it easy to travel. He began using the Line 6 in live shows with Maktub, in order to replicate the duplicate harmonies from the recorded material. Then he experimented with improvising entire songs in solo acts with the Line 6, playing initial gigs at small Seattle venues and artist bungalows. Also, while in Seattle, Reggie composed musical scores for Northwest dance choreographers and he dabbled in sketch comedy with future theatrical collaborator Tommy Smith.
In 2004, after recording five albums over eight years, Watts moved to the Lower East Side, New York City. In 2005, he recorded his first solo single, "So Beautiful".

Rich Jackson

Rich Jackson (born July 22, 1941 in New Orleans, Louisiana) was an American college and professional football player. In college Jackson played for Southern University. Jackson played for the American Football League's Oakland Raiders in 1966 and the AFL Denver Broncos from 1967 through 1969. He played for the NFL Broncos in 1970 through 1971, and the NFL Cleveland Browns in 1972. Jackson was All-Pro in 1969 and 1970. 
A defensive end whose nickname was "Tombstone", Jackson was famous for moves such as the "head slap" and the "halo spinner" which he used to subdue opposing offensive linemen. In the late Lyle Alzado's book "Mile High" he recalled Rich Jackson as the toughest man he'd ever met, and told the story of Jackson breaking the helmet of Green Bay Packer offensive tackle, Bill Hayhoe, with a headslap. He had 10 sacks in both 1968 and 1970 and posted a career-high total of 11 in 1969. He was named 1st Team All-AFL by the AP, Pro Football Weekly and UPI at the conclusion of the 1968 season and by the AP, NEA, NY Daily News, Pro Football Weekly, The Sporting News and UPI at the end of the 1969 season. He was also a unanimous 1st Team All-NFL choice in 1970. 
Jackson's career was cut short by a severe knee injury midway through the 1971 season. He finished with an unofficial total of 43 sacks, 31 of which came during the three season period of 1968-1970. Despite the shortened career, "Sports Illustrated"'s football expert, Paul Zimmerman, said that Tombstone Jackson was perhaps the finest overall defensive end and pass rusher he ever saw, a surefire Hall of Famer if he would have had a longer playing career, in a bigger media market. As it was Jackson will be remembered as a great one, only by a handful of football insiders, including those who lined up with and against him.
Jackson wore number 87 with the Broncos and was part of the inaugural class of inductees into the Denver Broncos' "Ring of Fame". He was inducted in 1984 along with safety Goose Gonsoulin, running back Floyd Little, and wide receiver Lionel Taylor. He was voted to the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1975.

Milecastle 52

Milecastle 52 (Bankshead) was a milecastle on Hadrian's Wall ().
Description.
Milecastle 52 is situated to the west of Birdoswald fort. It lies 1484 metres west of Milecastle 51 and 1520 metres east of Milecastle 53. The site is occupied by Bankshead House and garden. There is no trace of the milecastle visible.
Excavations.
Milecastle 52 was excavated in 1934. Although not now visible, excavation showed that it measures 27.5 m east to west by 23.4 m north to south and that it has Type III gateways. The stone milecastle replaced its underlying predecessor, Milecastle 52TW on the Turf Wall.
In 1808 two altars to the local deity Cocidius were discovered here. One of the altars was dedicated by soldiers of the Twentieth Legion in the years 262-6. In 1862 a broken slab was found with the name of Hadrian.
Associated Turrets.
Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 52 are known as Turret 52A and Turret 52B.
Turret 52A.
Turret 52A (Banks East) () is situated by the road east of Banks village. Excavations in 1933 uncovered remains of the demolished Turf Wall abutting the turret's east wall. The turret was in use from around the early 2nd century until at least the end of the 3rd century. The entrance is on the southeast side, and traces of two hearths and a low bench along the north west wall. The walls have been consolidated and restored, and stand to a maximum height of 1.75 metres. The turret was the first section of Hadrian's Wall to be placed in the guardianship of the Ancient Monuments department in 1934.
Turret 52B.
Turret 52B () has never been located. Its position has been estimated in relation to Turret 52A and Milecastle 53. It may lie beneath the modern road.
Pike Hill Signal Tower.
The remains of Pike Hill Signal Tower are situated 170 metres east of Turret 52A. The greater part of the signal tower has been destroyed by the modern road, but a fragment of its southeast wall, 2 metres long and 0.8 metres wide, is south of the road.

The show premiered September 9, 1974 and Joe and Rhoda married in the seventh episode. The network gave the marriage much advance publicity, and the episode proved a ratings blockbuster, having drawn some 50 million viewers to become one of television's most-watched single programs.
In season three, however, the couple separated, and they later divorced. According to Valerie Harper, Groh was written out of the show when the producers decided that "Rhoda" worked better with its star as a single woman. "We all felt very bad about David not continuing," she said. The two remained lifelong friends. However, this change was not embraced by the show's audience and ratings began to decline sharply. "Rhoda" was eventually canceled in the fall of 1978. Groh starred in his own series, the short-lived "Another Day", and went on to make his Broadway theatre debut in Neil Simon's "Chapter Two".
Later career.
From 1983 to 1985, Groh played D.L. Brock in the ABC daytime soap opera "General Hospital", leaving the show to appear in Off Broadway play "Be Happy for Me" (1986). "The New York Times" drama critic Frank Rich found Groh ""completely convincing as the brash gold-chain-and-bikini-clad Lothario"". Other New York City theater credits include "Road Show" (1987), and "The Twilight of the Golds" (1993).
On television, Groh appeared in guest roles on such series as "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century", "L.A. Law", "Baywatch", "Law & Order", "Murder, She Wrote", "Melrose Place", "The X-Files", and "JAG". His film career includes appearances in "Victory at Entebbe" (1976), "Get Shorty" (1995), and several independent films.
Personal life.
Groh was a serious collector of antique furniture and folk art, much of which he kept in a second home in Connecticut. He mainly resided, however, in Santa Monica, California, where he lived with his third wife, Kristin, and his son Spencer (by his second wife).
Death.
Groh died on February 12, 2008 of kidney cancer in a Los Angeles hospital at the age of 68.

Peaslake

Peaslake, Hoe and Colmar's Hill are in the centre of the Surrey Hills AONB and mid-west of the Greensand Ridge about ESE of the county town of Guildford, England point-to-point. Surrounded by denser pine and other coniferous forest-clad hills, the three conjoined settlements have a small core in Peaslake itself with the amenities of a village but are otherwise lightly scattered settlements at a higher elevation than the centre of Shere, the civil parish.
The area referred to by the 2011 census covers . Hurtwood Control maintains and coppices of surrounding forest, the Hurtwood which comprises: Holmbury Hill, Pitch Hill, Winterfold, Shere Heath, Farley Heath and part of Blackheath Common.
On similar terrain in the far east of the parish and borough is Holmbury St Mary which has been used in the latest edition of the London-Surrey Cycle Classic — both small villages are centres for hiking and mountain biking.
Amenities.
Amenities are a village hall, pub, a bike shop and a multi-purpose village shop does teas and hot snacks and incorporates a post office.
Place of worship.
The centre also has St Mark's church, built in 1889.
There are 2 churches in the parish, the Sunday morning Services alternate between them.
School.
The village school is unusual in that it is owned and run by residents and parents, who bought it after it was closed by the local education council in 1994. It is free to pupils (except those in the nursery classes) and raises all its own running costs (over £100,000 a year) without council or government support (aside from "early years" funding). It offers education for fifty children from age 3 to 7. The school was made a Free School in September 2013 
History.
No references to the hamlet were found by the research for the Victoria County History (Surrey: 1911) in Assize Rolls, Patent Rolls. Feet of Fines nor the ecclesiastical records of Westminster and Lambeth Palaces. The earliest mention is that in 1784 Francis Haybitle, a farm labourer "of Peaslake", left (to the vestry) a rentcharge of 15s. a year on a cottage in Shere to provide bread for the poor.
Peaslake School was founded by George Cubitt (the 1st Lord Ashcombe), Mr. Justice Bray, the Misses Spottiswoode, and others in 1870. John Bartholomew mentions the place in his gazetteer of 1887 as a village in Shere parish, Surrey "4½ miles SE. of Guildford". In the last decade of the 19th century a road from Ewhurst, practicable for wheels, was the first one brought into Peaslake as district councils were instituted. It was formerly accessible from the north, but was on the edge of the accessible country with no real road beyond. A Working Men's Institute which no longer exists was built in 1891 by the Misses Spottiswoode of Drydown, multiple benefactors to the neighbourhood. Most of the oldest houses were built in the brief Edwardian period (1901-1911).
Tourism and on screen.
Peaslake is set in rolling meadows and forests in terms of topography, soil type and land use. Its architecture and amenities have been the backdrop to filming. Access to the village by car can only be gained by using roads which are at some point single track, which gives visitors the feel that it is more remote than it is, and which makes it quieter than the villages closer to the A25. The position, in one of the most uniformly forested parts of the Greensand Ridge, provides a variety of trees on varying terrain.
Sports.
Peaslake is a focal point for mountain biking in the surrounding hills. The nearest railway station is Gomshall, a mile to the north.
On similar terrain in the far east of the parish and borough is Holmbury St Mary which has been used in the latest edition of the London-Surrey Cycle Classic — both small villages are centres for hiking and mountain biking.
Geography.
The scattered settlement with a core at Peaslake is at 110m to 210m above sea level; parts of the Shere parish to which belongs and which is nearest to these ascend a further 50 metres. All three adjoining small settlements are in the centre of the Surrey Hills and mid-west of the Greensand Ridge about from the county town of Guildford. Surrounded by square kilometres of forest and downland, this is a guidebook tourist destination for walking and cycling.
Hurtwood.
In total of surrounding forest, the Hurtwood SSSI, is maintained by the Friends of the Hurtwood which comprises: Holmbury Hill, Pitch Hill, Winterfold, Shere Heath, Farley Heath and part of Blackheath Common. Three of the nine car parks within Hurtwood are closest to Peaslake.
Almost east of Pitch Hill, wholly within Shere parish bounds and slightly closer to Holmbury St Mary, is Holmbury Hill - this is a Bronze Age multivallate hill fort; its elevation is 261m AOD.
Its most notable features are just over the parish bounds which are more generous as far as allocating the watershed (crest) is concerned to Ewhurst (in Waverley as shown by a dark line in the top-right map) is Pitch Hill (sometimes called "Coneyhurst Hill") which at is the fifth-highest point in Surrey, an adjoining wikt:knoll along the same crest has the Ewhurst Windmill, which is a somewhat rustic, inhabited listed example — its only other comparator in the South East is at Capel.
The Greensand Way runs from mid Kent to Hindhead, Surrey, on the border of Hampshire. It stays along its crest and therefore it is accessed from Peaslake by a nearly straight road at a similar elevation, using a natural ravine formed by the brook which rises on the opposite side of the Duke of Kent School, close but within Ewhurst parish.
Demography.
In all 111 houses make up the main centre of the village of 346 in total.
The United Kingdom Census 2011 considered the village as three relevant output layers, approximately a quarter of the ward "Shere", the latter being used for elections to Guildford Borough Council. All parts featured their single largest proportion of housing as single family homes with gardens.
The proportion of households in the three divisions of Peaslake who owned their home outright was at least 13.3% above the borough average and 19.4% above the national average (in Colmar's Hill, greater still in the other two). The proportion who owned their home with a loan was within 2% of the borough average except in Colmar's Hill where it was 9.9% greater than the national average. This provides in each area for a lower proportion than average of rented residential property and of social housing relative to the Surrey and national averages; in Colmar's Hill only 5% of housing was rented, or living rent-free from another.
Notable residents.
Notable residents include members of the band WinterKids

International Board on Books for Young People

The International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) is a non-profit organization based in Switzerland committed to bringing books and children together.
History.
In 1952 Jella Lepman organized a meeting in Munich, Germany, called "International Understanding through Children’s Books". Many authors, publishers, teachers and philosophers of the time attended the meeting and as a result a committee was appointed to create the International Board on Books for Young People – IBBY.
A year later in 1953, IBBY was registered as a non-profit organization in Zurich, Switzerland. The founding members included: Erich Kästner, Lisa Tetzner, Astrid Lindgren, Jo Tenfjord, Fritz Brunner, Bettina Hürlimann and Richard Bamberger. IBBY established an international award in 1956 and since then the Hans Christian Andersen Award has continued to be awarded every two years.
IBBY has six key aims:
IBBY Organization.
IBBY was founded in Zurich, Switzerland in 1953. Today, it is composed of more than seventy National Sections all over the world, including IBBY Canada, IBBY Ireland, IBBY Australia, and the United States Board on Books for Young People (USBBY).
It represents countries with well-developed book publishing and literacy programmes, and other countries with only a few dedicated professionals who are doing pioneer work in children's book publishing and promotion.
IBBY's policies and programmes are determined by its Executive Committee: ten people from different countries and a President, elected biennially by the National Sections at a General Assembly during the IBBY Congresses. They work on a voluntary basis. The daily management of IBBY's affairs is conducted from its Secretariat in Basel, Switzerland.
The annual dues from the National Sections are IBBY's only source of regular income. Independent financing is necessary to support IBBY activities.
As a non-governmental organization with an official status in UNESCO and UNICEF, IBBY has a policy-making role as an advocate of children's books. IBBY is committed to the principles of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by the United Nations in 1990. One of its main proclamations is the right of the child to a general education and to direct access to information. Thanks to IBBY’s insistence, the resolution includes an appeal to all nations to promote the production and distribution of children's books.
IBBY also cooperates with many international organizations and children's book institutions around the world and exhibits at the International Children's Book Fair in Bologna and other international book fairs.
National Sections.
The National Sections are organized in many different ways and operate on national, regional and international levels. In countries that do not have a National Section, individual membership in IBBY is possible.
The membership of the National Sections include authors and illustrators, publishers and editors, translators, journalists and critics, teachers, university professors and students, librarians and booksellers, social workers and parents.

North and South Cowton Community Primary School

North and South Cowton Community Primary School is located in North Cowton in Richmondshire, North Yorkshire, England.
The school board and school buildings at North and South Cowton primary are mentioned in Bulmer's "History and Directory of North Yorkshire", written in 1890.
The school is separated into two separate buildings, The Infant school building and the Primary school building. The two buildings are separated by about 100 metres of public road.
The primary school building dates from the Victorian period, though it has been extensively renovated and extended.
The school's Catchment area includes the villages of North Cowton and South Cowton, the hamlets of Dalton Gates, Atley Hill and Moulton End as well as several isolated farms.
The school was threatened with closure during the late 1980s as the Conservative Government of the time intended to cut the education budget by closing small rural schools with fewer than 30 pupils.
Thankfully the school survived the threat of closure and in 2004 boasted more than 50 pupils. The main reason for this is the increase in the size of North Cowton, thanks to the construction of two new housing estates. Another reason is the schools acceptance of several children from outside the schools catchment area. Since then the opening of a new school at Middleton Tyas and a number of families moving out of the village have seen numbers fall.

Santa Maria in Via

Santa Maria in Via is a basilica church in Rome. The church or a chapel existed in the 9th century, but was rebuilt following reports of a miracle. In 1165, it is recorded as Santa Maria in Via, whose appellative means "on the Way", with a reference to the close by Via Flaminia.
On the site there was the house of Cardinal Pietro Capocci, with a well in the stables. On the night of 26 September 1256, the well overflowed. A picture of Our Lady was floating on the waters, which disappeared as soon as the picture was taken. Pope Alexander IV declared it a miracle, and ordered the construction of a chapel on its place; in the chapel (the first on the right of the current church) there is still the well of the miracle.
Pope Innocent VIII ordered the construction of the current church, which was built in 1491-1513. Renovations were performed under Francesco da Volterra and later by Carlo Lombardi. The façade and portico were designed by Pietro da Cortona (1660). The main altar was decorated by Santi Ghetti. The works were completed under Cardinal Saint Robert Bellarmine, titular of the church, in 1604.
The "Titulus S. Mariae in Via" was instituted by Pope Julius III in 1551. The first Cardinal Priest was Giulio della Cornea; among the others, Saint Robert Bellarmine and Stefano Pignatelli. Cardinal Priest was Antonio José González Zumárraga.
The church has been served by the Servite Order since a grant of Pope Leo X in 1513.

Geojurisprudence

Geojurisprudence is "a systemic approach to the connections of legal science to geography and geopolitics" (Manfred Langhans-Ratzeburg - "Begriff und Aufgaben der Geographischen Rechtswissenshaft (Geojurisprudenz)" published by Kurt Vowinkel in 1928 as a companion volume to Karl Haushofers "Zeitschrift für Geopolitik" (ZfG).
Haushofer opened the topic in his essay "Geopolitik und Geojurisprudenz" which appeared in "Zeitschrift für Völkerrecht" in 1928. Here he lamented the lack of geographical understanding in German legal studies. 
He said this contributed towards the general failure of the German populace to understand the nature of the First World War. He heralded Langhans-Ratzeburg as the chief representative of this new discipline, which he suggested would overcome the "thin, sterile air of legal scientific concepts and the fraudulent, political scientific, treaty-waving political posture of the so-called central powers". 
With a return to putatively "German" concepts of legal relations between states, invigorated by incorporating a geographical perspective, then borders as durable legal structures rooted in geography would emerge.
With this introduction, "Langhans-Ratzeburg" in turn praised not only Haushofer, but also Alfred Hettner, Walther Vogel and Albert von Hoffmann for their attempts to link geography, history, politics and culture.

Tjølling

Tjølling is a former municipality in Vestfold county, Norway. Tjølling was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). It was merged with Larvik January 1, 1988.
Location.
Vestfold is known as the sunny holiday coast line. People from other parts of the country spend their summer vacations there. The coastline is a beautiful area; during the last Ice Age, this was were the end of the glacier polished the granite rocks, making them smooth and without any sharp edges. Boat lovers often travel the fjords and spend time on the islands. Midsummers Eve is a peak moment in Vestfold. Attendees move out to the beaches or into their boats and have barbecues, swim, playing games and await the grand finale at midnight when bonfires are lit all around the coastline.
History.
Tjølling is the site of one of the oldest Viking settlement within Scandinavia. Kaupang was a big trading centre for the Vikings. There have been several earlier archaeological surveys and excavations at Kaupang. In 1867 Antiquarian Nicolay Nicolaysen mapped one of the grave-fields around the former town and excavated 79 grave mounds. He uncovered a cremation cemetery, largely dated to the 10th century. Charlotte Blindheim (1917-2005) started excavating in 1947 and completed her last publication in 1999. In 1997, Dagfinn Skre and his associates undertook a new program of work at Kaupang followed by a large excavation that ran over three years, from 2000 till 2002. Most recently it has been the site of post-excavation work conducted by the University of Oslo.
Name.
The site was apparently the location of a Thing for the district long before the introduction of Christianity. The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old church site ("Tjølling kyrkje"). The Old Norse form of the name was "Þjóðarlyng". The first element is the genitive case of "þjóð" f 'crowd of people; assembly', the last element is "lyng" n 'heather' (here in the sense 'heath, moor').

Luz Station

The Luz Station (, ) is the common name for a railway station in the Luz neighbourhood in São Paulo, Brazil. The station is part of the metropolitan rail system run by the CPTM. The station is mostly notable for housing the Museum of the Portuguese Language, established in 2006. The Luz Metro station is also located within the complex.
History.
The station was built in the late 19th century with the purpose of being the headquarters of the newly founded São Paulo Railway. In the first decades of the 20th century, it was the main entrance to the city, a fact that gave it a major economic relevance, because the majority of the coffee from Santos was delivered in the station, along with the imported supplies.
The current building was finished in 1901. The materials for its construction were brought from UK. The station was designed and produced by Walter Macfarlane & Co. Saracen Foundry Glasgow. The station was assembled in Glasgow, then disassembled and sent to São Paulo where it was reassembled. The building was designed by the English architect Henry Driver.
In the 1940s, the station caught fire and during the rebuilding process, a new floor was added to the building. Since then, the rail transport in Brazil started to decline, the same happened with the Luz neighbourhood. Both factors led to the degradation of the station. However, in the 1990s, the station was repaired.
Cultural influence.
The station is a remain from the period when the coffee was a major source of income to the city. For decades, the station tower dominated the city's skyline and its clock was the reference to the other clocks in São Paulo.
At its height, in the early 20th century, when the Luz neighbourhood was an important part of the city, the station was part of an architectonic block that was a major reference inside the city. The station helped to build the city's image.
With the construction of the São Paulo Metro, during the 1970s, the monument to Ramos de Azevedo, a major landmark in the nearby zones, radically changed the image of the landscape, granting, however, a greater sense of monumentality to the station.

Operational history.
Conducted strategic bombardment of Axis targets in Europe, but between 29 August 1944 and 2 October 1944 division aircraft dropped food to the French population in liberated areas. It also airdropped food, equipment, and supplies to Allied forces engaged in the airborne attack on the Netherlands (September 1944), as well as troops engaged in the assault across the Rhine River (March 1945). From January 1949 to May 1951, in West Germany it participated in numerous training exercises. Activated in April 1953, it remained unmanned and existed in name until moving in March 1954 to Dhahran Airfield, Saudi Arabia where it remained until the Saudi government terminated US rights to the field in 1962. Organized at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam in October 1962 to control USAF operations there. From December 1962, it controlled all activities and units in Southeast Asia, initially, USAF tactical forces FARM GATE C/H- 47, B/RB-26, T-28, and U-10 counterinsurgency forces, and MULE TRAIN C-123 assault airlift forces. Forces assigned and attached to the 2d Air Division trained Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) and Royal Thai Air Force personnel, flew reconnaissance, airlift, and defoliation missions, and operated a tactical control system. Escalation of fighting in South Vietnam in early 1965 brought new offensive assignments. On 8 February 1965 USAF and VNAF aircraft assaulted targets north of the demilitarized zone in the first of a series of continuing strikes. On 19 February 1965, USAF F-100 Super Sabres and B-57 Canberras attacked the Viet Cong inside South Vietnam the first use of jets for such offensive actions. In July 1965, a major reorganization of the division saw tactical fighter wings established at Bien Hoa Air Base and Danang Air Base, and five separate combat support groups at other South Vietnamese bases. The rapid expansion of the division's personnel and facilities continued well into 1966, with a matching expansion in both the volume and variety of air operations. On 1 April 1966, the division's resources were absorbed by the newly activated Seventh Air Force. From March 1983-February 1987, 2d Air Division forces, with worldwide responsibilities and assignments, engaged in deployment, exercise and training programs. Subordinate units flew drug interdiction missions under Operation BAT.
World War Two.
The 2d Air Division came into being following the reorganisation of the 8th USAAF Bomber Command as the Eighth Air Force. Existing as a separate entity the 2d Bomb Wing started operations on 7 November 1942, was reorganized as the 2nd Bomb Division on 13 September 1943, and redesignated the 2nd Air Division in January 1945. The division continued operations until the end of the war, flying the last combat sortie on 25 April 1945.
The group completed 493 operational missions in Europe during World War Two consisting of 95,948 individual aircraft sorties. The 2d Air Division operated the Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft from airfields in Norfolk, England.
Within the 2d Air Division, six groups received presidential citations for outstanding actions. Five airmen received the highest US award for bravery, the Medal of Honor, four of them posthumously. A total of 1,458 B-24 aircraft were lost in action and 6,700 men lost their lives.
Vietnam War.
The 2d Air Division was organized in Saigon in October 1962 under the authority of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. Until the build-up of American forces in 1965, the 2d Air Division provided air support to the forces of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Originally, the unit consisted of propeller-driven aircraft, but the build-up in US forces saw the arrival of jet aircraft and, by the end of 1965, the US had deployed nearly 500 US combat aircraft in South Vietnam. By the time the unit was transformed into the Seventh Air Force on 1 April 1966, it consisted of nearly 1,000 aircraft and approximately 30,000 personnel.
Special Operations.
2d Air Division aircrews received an important role in the vice president's South Florida Drug Task Force. Aircrews from the 20th SOS helped curb the flow of illegal drugs into the United States through the Bahamas in Operation BAT (Bahamas and Turks) by transporting Bahamian authorities and American drug enforcement agents to sites of drug action. In almost two and a half years, the squadron flew more than 1,100 sorties which supported the capture or destruction of more than $1.5 billion in drugs, vessels, aircraft, equipment and weapons. During the operation, one 20th SOS UH-1N helicopter crashed at sea resulting in the death of three squadron members.
In late October 1983, the 2d AD provided three AC-130H Spectre gunships and five MC-130E Combat Talons to support Operation Urgent Fury on the island of Grenada, off the coast of Venezuela. The U.S. government considered Americans, primarily medical students studying in Grenada, in imminent danger from anti-American elements. The U.S. organized a joint task force of Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine elements to expedite their rescue with the 1st SOW aircraft leading the air assault.

Open-handed drumming

Open-handed drumming refers to a method of playing a drum kit.
Method.
The method is without crossing the hands when playing the hi-hat (or ride-cymbal) and snare drum simultaneously as opposed to the more traditional way of playing drums which features crossed hands as the basic playing position. When playing open-handed, left-handed (and right-footed) drummers will play the hi-hat with their left hand (instead of the right hand) and the snare with the right hand. However, in addition, setting up hi-hats and ride-cymbals on both sides of the drumkit will also help to avoid the crossing of hands which limits the range of musical options. Absolute beginners often choose this open-handed way of playing as their first and natural attempt to drumming.
A number of right cross-handed drummers experiment and are comfortable with open-handed drumming but do not always play in that configuration. Steve Smith and Deen Castronovo have used the open hand technique for the Journey song "Don't Stop Believin'".
Beginnings and development.
Open handed playing was first conceived as idea with Jim Chapin's book "Advanced Techniques for the Modern Drummer", and Gary Chester's book "The New Breed" which emphasize on coordinated independence, leading with both hands and legs.
First drummers who started open-handed playing are musicians like Billy Cobham, Steve Upton, Lenny White who started this way of playing in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
In 2008 and 2011 Dom Famularo and Claus Hessler wrote "Open Handed Playing vol.1 and 2", which are lessons focused entirely on open-handed playing.
Modern younger drummers who sport open-handed playing are Ilan Rubin, drummer of Angels & Airwaves, Josh Eppard of Coheed and Cambria and Michael "Moose" Thomas from Bullet For My Valentine.

Polyurethane laminate

Polyurethane laminate (PUL) is a compound fabric made by laminating a cloth fabric to a thin film of polyurethane. Polyurethane laminated fabrics have a wide range of applications in medical, automotive and garment uses, PUL generally refers to a specific type used by makers of resuable incontinence products and accessories such as nappies, wet bags, and cloth menstrual pads.
Most PUL fabric is made by laminating lightweight polyester interlock knit fabric to a 1 mil thick film of polyurethane. There are two processes used for lamination: solvent lamination which fuses the fabric and polyurethane film into a single monolithic fabric and hot melt which uses heat activated glue to adhere the fabrics together. 
This laminated fabric is useful as a wind and/or water barrier in the construction of fluid-splash protecting garments, shower curtains, outerwear clothing, however it is primarily used for making cloth nappies / diapers and cloth menstrual pads. It can be machine-washed and dried.

United States Air Force Seek Eagle Office

The United States Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (USAF SEEK EAGLE Office, AFSEO) was started to improve the combat capability of the warfighter. The SEEK EAGLE Program, which is the standard for the aircraft-stores certification process of the United States Air Force (USAF), was created for this purpose. This program certifies all weapons (conventional and nuclear), suspension equipment, tanks, and pods carried externally or internally. The process includes safe upload and download procedures; flight limits for safe carriage, employment, jettison, safe escape, and ballistic accuracy verification. The SEEK EAGLE process includes the integrated use of digital modeling, simulation, and analysis; ground tests; and flight tests to obtain/generate the data needed to verify aircraft-store compatibility accuracy of and update Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) and Technical Orders (TOs).
Mission.
Ensure new warfighter capabilities through the application and transfer of aircraft-store compatibility expertise.
History.
The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO) is a named Air Force Unit and, by Special Order, the single point of expertise for aircraft-store compatibility. 
In the early stages of air warfare, aircraft-store compatibility was not a significant consideration except to ensure that weapons would fit onto and function with a carrier aircraft. During the Vietnam War, aircraft entered the inventory that were large and powerful enough to carry significant tonnage of weapons. Also, many new weapons were being developed. The management of the resulting marriage of the aircraft and weapons provided a bewildering matrix of combinations that had to be identified, prioritized, analyzed and certified in a timely manner. 
At the end of the war, the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom was the USAF mainstay tactical combat aircraft. Virtually every store in existence was certified for use on the F-4. In the late 1970s, the USAF decided to replace the F-4 with the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-16 exhibited many more incompatibilities with weapons than the F-4 did. As the F-4 was phased out, the F-16 combat users found they were not getting the quantity and quality of combat capability they were expecting. Their mounting frustration culminated in 1986 when the Commander of the Tactical Air Command challenged HQ USAF to fix the problem. HQ USAF directed the SEEK EAGLE revitalization study. That study resulted in the establishment of the AFSEO in December 1987, when the office was chartered by the Secretary of the Air Force.

Accademia Musicale Chigiana

The Accademia Musicale Chigiana ("English": Chigiana Musical Academy) is a music institute in Siena, Italy. It was founded by Count Guido Chigi Saracini in 1932 as an international centre for advanced musical studies. It organises Master Classes in the major musical instruments as well as singing, conducting and composition. During the summer months a series of concerts are held under the title of "Estate Musicale Chigiana". 
Amongst the teachers at the academy in the 1950s was Clotilde von Derp and Alexander Sakharoff who stopped their international touring to teach here at the invitation of the Count.
In 1983 the Accademia Musicale Chigiana, Fulvia Casella Nicolodi and Guido Turchi created an International Composition Competition named after Alfredo Casella, for the one hundredth anniversary of his birth. The International "Accademia Musicale Chigiana Prize" has been assigned, and among the winners’ names are some of the most famous ones in international concert circles: the violinists Gidon Kremer (1982), Shlomo Mintz (1984), Anne-Sophie Mutter (1986), Viktoria Mullova (1988), Frank Peter Zimmermann (1990), Gil Shaham (1992), Maxim Vengerov (1995), Julian Rachlin (2000), Hilary Hahn (2002) and Sarah Chang (2005), the pianists Peter Serkin (1983), Krystian Zimerman (1985), Andras Schiff (1987), Andrei Gavrilov (1989), Evgeny Kissin (1991), Andrea Lucchesini (1994), Lilya Zilberstein (1998), Leif Ove Andsnes (2001) and Arcadi Volodos (2003), as well as the orchestral conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen (1993), the Hagen Quartet (1996) and the Artemis Quartet (2004), the violist Tabea Zimmermann (1997) and the violoncellist Matt Haimovitz (1999). These names join the history of the Accademia Chigiana, already studded with illustrious presences. In (2006) the Prize has been assigned to the pianist Paul Lewis. The 2010 Prize goes to Polish pianist Rafal Blechacz. 
The Quintetto Chigiano took its name from this Academy: its leader, Riccardo Brengola, was Professor Emeritus at the Accademia for 64 years.
The Academy occupies the 14th-century Palazzo Chigi-Saracini and contains an important library of musical and literary works of over 70,000 volumes as well as The Chigi Saracini Art Collection and The Musical Instrument Museum.

German submarine U-3519

German submarine "U-3519" was a Type XXI U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. The "Elektroboote" submarine was laid down on 19 September 1944 at the Schichau-Werke yard at Danzig, launched on 23 November 1944, and commissioned on 6 January 1945 under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Richard von Harpe.
"U-3519" was a brand new, high technology electric boat which could run constantly submerged rather than having to surface to recharge her batteries every day the way submarines until that point had had to do. Unfortunately for the Germans, these advanced vessels were only introduced to the "Kriegsmarine" late in 1944, much too late to influence the Battle of the Atlantic, and too late for many of them to serve in an offensive capacity at all.
With the end of the war near, training on U-boats had dropped to a minimum due to lack of fuel, falling morale and the effectiveness of allied attacks on U-boat construction and preparation. The exception to this were the new Type XXI boats, which continued to train in the Baltic Sea. To prevent this, the Royal Air Force dropped thousands of sea mines into German territorial waters, in the hope that submarines entering or leaving harbour or training in shallow waters would be lost on them. This is what destroyed the "U-3519" on 2 March 1945, when she ran afoul of an air-dropped mine near Warnemünde, in position and sank to the bottom taking all 65 of her crew with her.

<doc id="5853146" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5853146" title="Color Air">
Color Air

Color Air AS was the first Norwegian low-cost airline. It operated from Oslo Airport, Gardermoen in 1998 and 1999 with a fleet of three Boeing 737-300 aircraft. Color Air was a brand extension of Color Line, which shared a common owner in the Olav Nils Sunde-controlled Color Group. The airline operated five daily round trips from Oslo to Trondheim and Bergen, four to Ålesund and one to London, in addition to a weekly trip to Alicante. Color Air pioneered the low-cost business model in Norway, with a denser seating, no frills and lack of a frequent flyer program. Tickets were sold only via the Internet, by telephone or in supermarkets; when bought from travel agents, there was a surcharge.
The airline was established in response to the opening of Gardermoen, which would allow any airline sufficient landing slots to compete with the incumbents Braathens and Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). Color Air commenced operations on 1 August 1998, with the two other airlines moving from Oslo Airport, Fornebu on 8 October. Following the airline's establishment, a price war broke out between it and the two incumbents. All three increased capacity and dropped prices, giving a 40% increase in seats on the dominant domestic routes and seat loads of between 30 and 50 percent. After thirteen months and NOK 400 million in losses, Color Air gave up and filed for bankruptcy. The price war cost the three airlines more than NOK 3 billion, and ultimately forced the other two to merge.
Service.
All flights were based at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. For the summer routes of 1999, Color Air operated four daily round trips to Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and five daily round trips to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. In addition, there was a single daily round trip to London Stansted Airport, and a weekly round trip to Alicante Airport. From each domestic destination, flights were made to correspond with the Color Line cruiseferries departing from Oslo to Kiel, Germany, and Hirtshals, Denmark.
Color Air had only one seating class, offered no on-board beverages and had no frequent flyer program or lounges. Color Air had an agreement for tickets to be sold at the Rimi supermarkets, as well as by phone and Internet. If bought at a travel agency, there was a NOK 200 surcharge. This was because Color Air was not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to the costs associated with membership.
Fleet.
The airline had three Boeing 737-300 aircraft, built in 1994. Originally fitted with 136 seats each, they were later reduced to 124, and then increased to 142. The aircraft were owned by International Lease Finance Corporation and General Electric Capital, and cost NOK 2.25 million per month to lease, plus additional costs per hour. They were British-registered and operated by Air Foyle HeavyLift, while maintenance was performed by British Midland. Both companies are based in the United Kingdom. Ground handling was carried out by SAS Ground Services in Trondheim, Bergen and Ålesund, and by Servisair in Oslo.
History.
Background.
With Norway joining the European Economic Area, the Norwegian airline market was deregulated from 1 April 1994. While airlines formerly needed a concession from the Ministry of Transport to fly a particular route, they could now compete freely on any domestic or international routes. Previously the two major airlines Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE each had their own routes, but from 1994 both established themselves on several of the main-haul routes.
With increased traffic, there soon became a capacity problem at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, the main hub for both SAS and Braathens. During the peak times during the morning and afternoon rush, there were no excess slots for new airlines. To compensate, the Norwegian Airport Administration was building a new main airport for Eastern Norway, to be located at Gardermoen. A larger terminal and two runways would give ample room for expansion, and entry of new airlines. The new airport opened on 8 October 1998.
Establishment.
In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde announced that he would establish a low-cost airline following the opening of the new airport. The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and the lawyer Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's shipping company Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.
Following the announcement to establish Color Air, Braathens SAFE chose to rebrand itself. They launched a new livery, and changed their name to just Braathens. Starting with the company's first Boeing 737-700 delivered on 23 March, Braathens introduced the business class, Braathens Best, that would take up 70% of the cabin, and the economy class Braathens Back, that would be at the back of the cabin. From 1 April, a new NOK 65 tax was introduced on all domestic flights. Braathens and SAS decided to divide the cross-subsidize the taxes between their routes, something Color Air was not able to do. This was because the tax was only valid for routes within Southern Norway; Braathens and SAS could therefore tacitly collude to increase the prices to Northern Norway, and thereby subsidize their routes in Southern Norway. Color Air, on the other hand, would be forced to put the full tax on all its departures. While the government had no way to hinder the incumbents from doing this, Gudmund Restad, Minister of Finance from the Centre Party, encouraged the airlines to not "cheat", and follow the intentions of the law, even if he admitted that there was nothing the government could do to hinder the airlines from cross-subsidizing.
The contract to lease two Boeing 737-300 aircraft from 1994 was made with International Lease Finance Corporation in May. Maintenance was outsourced to a British company, after Braathens, which also operated 737 Classic aircraft, had denied Color Air the use of its simulators and technical workshops. For the start-up, Color Air hired 18 pilots, 40 flight attendants and 40 ground employees, in addition to the administration. The company was criticized for only hiring women flight attendants. Braathens operated with an internal pension age of 58 years for its pilots, while SAS had a 60 year age limit. Due to EEA rules, the judicial age limit was 65 years, so Color Air was able to hire retired SAS and Braathens pilots. These could be paid only NOK 500,000 in annual wage, since they received a full pension from their old employers on top of it. The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association stated that this was morally reprehensible, but Color Air was supported by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, medical experts, and SAS, who all claimed that there were no medical reasons to not let people in their 60s operate aircraft.
Start of operation.
The first aircraft was delivered on 1 August 1998. While the new airport at Gardermoen would not officially open until 8 October, when also SAS and Braathens would move to the airport, Color Air started flights from Gardermoen to Ålesund Airport, Vigra on 6 August. Flights to Trondheim Airport, Værnes commenced on 8 August, while the Bergen Airport, Flesland-route started 15 August. After a week, very few passengers were traveling with Color Air, with two at the least and twenty-four at the most per departure. Color Air was losing NOK 650,000 per week of operation.
The pricing scheme was based on tickets for NOK 399, 499, 599 and 699, plus NOK 71 in taxes. At least ten tickets were available at the lowest price per departure, and the first to order were granted the cheapest tickets. Tickets had no restrictions on cancellation, and were not subject to restrictions on return dates.
With the opening of Gardermoen, both Braathens and SAS increased the number of flights. Braathens established a route to Haugesund, while SAS started routes to Ålesund and Kristiansand. The number of daily trips from Oslo for SAS increased from 59 to over 80. In total, the three companies increased their daily round trip from 138 to 200, and the daily seat capacity from 18,000 to 26,000. Ålesund had the largest increase, from seven daily round trips only with Braathens, to seventeen offered by all three companies. On the route to Trondheim, the number of departures had increased from 27 to 39, with Braathens operating 19, SAS 16 and Color Air 5. The increase in seats was profitable for the state; the new seat tax—which was also applicable to unsold seats—received an annual revenue increase of NOK 110 million.
The first plane planned to leave Gardermoen was an SAS aircraft. However, since it was 20 minutes delayed, a Color Air aircraft was instead the first to take off, at 06:52 on 8 August 1998. By the end of October, the airline had between 40 and 50% cabin load, and the company stated that it needed "slightly more than 50%" to make a profit. It also announced that it would receive three more aircraft to supplement the two it had in service. Instead of starting a route to Stavanger, the company instead chose to open a route to London Stansted Airport starting 1 December. The airline stated that it did not have sufficient aircraft do make more than two round trips to Stavanger, and that this would be too little to be a credible operator on the route.
Price war.
In November, Color Air changed the conditions tied to purchase of tickets. Reduced price tickets were only available seven days or more before departure, and only full-price tickets could be refunded. At the same time, the maximum price increased to NOK 870, though all ticket prices were changed to include all taxes, after requirements from the authorities. A new, cheapest ticket was introduced at NOK 345, including taxes. After the winter settled, the front between Color Air and Braathens grew colder following Braathens' denying Color Air to use their deicing equipment at Ålesund, resulting in the plane being stuck at the airport.
In November, Color Air transported 102,544 passengers. From mid-December, the company had a time-limited offer of tickets for NOK 200.
In September, the ownership of Color Air was rearranged. Sunde reallocated his ownership and created Color Group, that would wholly own both Color Line, Scandi Line, Larvik Line and Color Air. Sunde retained a 77% ownership in the corporation through Larvik Scandi Line. The group was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In the general meeting held in December, two of the largest owners of Color Line, Vital Forsikring and the Government Pension Fund of Norway, both were opposed to the merger, as they felt the purchased companies were overvalued. Color Air was at the time valuated at NOK 157 million. After a long process between the miniority shareholders and Color Group, the valuation was adjusted to NOK 108 million. In May, Olav Nils Sunde bought the entire Color Group, and delisted it from the stock exchange following the conflict with the other shareholders.
By the end of 1998, it became clear that Braathens had increased capacity by 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several large cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. Accumulated cabin load for Color Air was 32%, with 116,176 passengers. In the course of the last quarter of 1998, Color Air lost NOK 91 million, or NOK 1 million each day. For the whole year, Color Air had an average ticket price of NOK 453, giving a revenue of NOK 57 million. NOK 45 million was used on taxes, giving NOK 12 million to cover operating costs of NOK 209 million. The company lost NOK 197 million in 1998.
In February 1999, Braathens announced that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden to avoid having to pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK 10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.
In the first quarter of 1999, Color Air transported 100,472 passengers. This gave a cabin load of 35%, of which the Trondheim route had 40% and the Ålesund route 32%. This gave the airline a deficit of NOK 92 million. SAS lost NOK 22 million, while Braathens had lost NOK 300 million. In comparison, both Braathens and SAS Norway made a NOK 320 million profit in the first quarter of 1998.
On 1 April, Color Air won a two-year contract with Norway Post for all air mail from Oslo to Trondheim and Ålesund. On 10 April, Color Air started a weekly round trip each Saturday to Alicante Airport in Spain. On 12 April, Ove Johan Solem took over as CEO of Color Air. In May, the company increased the cabin load from 38 to 48%, with ridership increasing from 33,978 to 44,081. These numbers also included a change in the number of seats per plane. The following month, 46,777 people traveled with the airline. By the end of July, Color Air had lost NOK 350 million. However, in July, Color Air had a cabin load exceeding 50%, the level Sunde had stated was necessary to make a profit.
In September, SAS announced that if Braathens took the first step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air announced that they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. The load factor in August was 43%, and management stated that 50% load would not be sufficient to make money. In particular, the company stated that while aircraft were full during the weekends, the company was not succeeding at garnering the necessary business ridership to fill up the planes during the weekdays. To become more attractive, the company changed its fares to two classes: Business Full Flex and Saver No Flex. The company also stated that to attract more business travelers, it was looking for an international parter to conduct codesharing on international routes, and perhaps also introduce a frequent flyer program alone or in cooperation with the partner.
Bankruptcy.
On 27 September 1999, Color Air terminated all flights and ceased operations. Sunde stated that he regretted having started the airline, and said that he had overestimated the synergies between his ferry company and the airline, but also underestimated the price elasticity for business travel. In particular, the frequent flyer programs that SAS and Braathens had made it difficult to convince corporate travelers to switch to Color Air. Sunde believed that the company would continue to lose money in 2000. 220 employees lost their jobs, while Color Group estimated it lost NOK 400 million on the airline. There were discussions concerning cooperation with, or a take-over by, British Airways, but these discussions did not lead to an agreement. In total, Color Air flew 430,000 passengers, effectively subsidizing each passenger with almost NOK 1000. The company was not declared bankrupt, as Sunde wanted to insure his good reputation by paying everyone he owed money. While this was about NOK 10 million in airport fees and smaller sums to other parties, the largest creditors were the two aircraft leasing companies, to whom NOK 270 million was owed for the rest of the rental period. The 20,000 people who had tickets with Color Air were all rebooked onto Braathens flights. After NOK 170 million in debt was registered by the company, and assets were only worth NOK 17 million, Color Air was declared bankrupt on 10 November 1999.
On the day of the termination, the stock price of Braathens increased by 16%, while SAS's increased 3%. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated that this had nothing to do with the elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway on the tailplane that since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK 1 billion in 1999, and the total cost of the price war between the three airlines exceeded NOK 3 billion.

"Sunday Girl" is a 1978 song written and recorded by the American group Blondie. The track was a no. 1 hit in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in May 1979, but despite this was not released as a single in the United States.
Song information.
The song was written by Chris Stein and was the fourth single to be taken from the album, "Parallel Lines", in the UK and most other parts of the world. The single had an unusual release in Australia, with some dispute among fans as to whether it reached no. 1 there or failed to chart. This is because of its initial release as the lead single from "Parallel Lines", due to its being reminiscent of "In The Flesh", Blondie's first hit in Australia. "Sunday Girl" failed to chart, however, and was later re-released as a double A-Side with "Heart of Glass", on the back of its UK success. As a result, it was eclipsed by the disco track, and is rarely recognised as having charted in its own right.
Like Blondie's earlier single, "Hanging on the Telephone", the drumming pattern of "Sunday Girl" employs a double backbeat rhythm.
A French-language version of the track was released in the UK on the "Sunday Girl" 12" single; in France and the Netherlands, it was the B-side of the 7". It also appears on the cassette release of "Eat to the Beat". For Blondie's first greatest hits album "The Best of Blondie" in 1981, producer Mike Chapman created a special mix which incorporated one verse sung in French. The bilingual version appears on the 2002 compilation "Greatest Hits".
In 2010 a remake of this song was made by the English performer Florrie. It had slightly different lyrics and was used for a Nina Ricci perfume commercial. The song was covered in 2013 by the band She & Him on the album "Volume 3".
In 2013 Blondie themselves re-recorded the song and offered it to be included in the CBGB's film soundtrack. This version was included on their 2014 compilation album "Greatest Hits Deluxe Redux". The compilation was part of a 2-disc set called "Blondie 4(0) Ever" which included their 10th studio album "Ghosts of Download" and marked the 40th anniversary of the forming of the band.

Mick Gooding

Michael Charles Gooding (born 12 April 1959 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England) is a former professional footballer and football manager. 
In the twilight of a successful playing career, Gooding was appointed joint player-manager of Reading with Jimmy Quinn when manager Mark McGhee acrimoniously left to take the reins at Leicester City. Under their guidance, Reading finished second in the First Division, but were left to battle for a place in the Premier League through the playoffs, as the Premier League was being reduced in size from 22 teams to 20. Reading were beaten 4-3 by Bolton Wanderers in the playoff final at Wembley.
Gooding and Quinn remained in charge at Elm Park for two seasons afterwards, until they were replaced by Terry Bullivant after failing to mount any further promotion challenges.
After Reading, Gooding had a short spell at Southend United, before retiring from football. He remained at Roots Hall for a while as a coach.
He has since carved himself a career as a radio commentary pundit, performing such roles as co-commentator for BBC Radio Berkshire's coverage of Reading's Premier League matches, while also working as an estate agent in Mortimer.
Despite playing 701 league games in a career stretching 20 years, Gooding never played top division football - the closest he came to reaching the top flight was with Reading when they narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League in 1995.

Peter of Rates

Saint Peter of Rates (), also known in English as Saint Peter of Braga, is traditionally considered to be the first bishop of Braga between the years 45 and 60. Tradition says he has been ordered to preach the Christian faith by Saint James the Great, and that Peter of Rates was martyred while attempting to make converts to the Christian faith in northern Portugal. The ancient "Breviary of Braga" ("Breviarium Bracarense") and the "Breviary of Evora" hold that St. Peter of Rates was a disciple of St. James and preached at Braga. However, the Bollandists argue that this claim is “purely traditional.”
Life.
The legend holds that Saint James, one of the apostles of Christ, visited the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula in 44 AD. One of his alleged visits occurred at Serra de Rates, in the current municipality of Póvoa de Varzim. During his visit, the apostle is said to have ordained the local Peter of Rates as the first bishop of Braga. This is probably a myth, given that it is proven that Saint James was celebrating Easter in Jerusalem precisely in this year.
It is believed that Saint Peter of Rates was beheaded while converting believers of the Roman religion to the Christian faith.
The discovery of Peter's body by Saint Felix.
Centuries later, around the 9th century, the discovery of Peter's body was attributed to Saint Felix the Hermit, a fisherman of Villa Mendo, an ancient Roman villa that existed until the early years of the Kingdom of Portugal, and rediscovered in the 20th century under the sand dunes of Rio Alto in Estela, also in Póvoa de Varzim. 
Felix had left home and settled in the biggest hill of the area, which is today known as São Félix Hill. Regularly, Saint Félix observed a light in the darkness of the night from the hill. One day, curious about the light's origins, Felix came upon the body of Saint Peter of Rates. On that spot, the Romanesque Monastery of Rates was built, and the relics kept there until 1552; in that year the body was transferred to Braga Cathedral, were it is still kept. Scientific studies suggest that the body kept in Braga is from a 9th-century child.
Miraculous fountains of Saint Peter of Rates.
In the civil parishes of Balasar and Rates in Póvoa de Varzim, there are two fountains that the population believes are miraculous because they were used by this saint. 
In the 18th century, there are descriptions that Saint Peter of Rates was beheaded while drinking the waters of the fountain in Balasar. The population believes that two indentations on the fountain are impressions from the saint's knees. At the fountain of Rates, a stone is believed to cure in cases of sterility. Due to that belief, on April 26 of every year, the feast day of Saint Peter of Rates, the pregnant women and female animals do not work in some villages.

Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway

The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJ&AR) was a suburban railway which operated a 13.7 km (8½ mile) route between Altrincham in Cheshire and London Road Station (now Piccadilly) in Manchester. 
The MSJ&AR line is notable for having operated with three different systems of electrification within a period of about 60 years. The fast, frequent service resulting from the introduction of the first generation of electric trains in 1931 was a significant contributor to suburban development in the Stretford, Sale and Altrincham districts, south-west of Manchester.
The southern part of the MSJ&AR’s route has been part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system since 1992. The northern section between Manchester Piccadilly and Deansgate stations is now an intensively-used section of the National Rail network, used by trains running north and west of Manchester.
Construction.
Manchester’s London Road railway station (today’s Piccadilly) was opened on 8 May 1842. London Road was the terminus for two trunk lines approaching the city from the south and east - the "Manchester and Birmingham Railway" from Stockport and Crewe, and the "Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway," which at that point ran only as far as Godley, but would eventually be extended to Sheffield via the Woodhead route.
Even in the early days, it was clear that the dead-end terminal at London Road would need to be connected to the other railway lines serving Manchester. The Manchester & Birmingham and the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne & Manchester companies proposed an extension of their lines which would skirt the southern part of Manchester city centre on a 2.4 km (1½ mile) viaduct, and join the Liverpool and Manchester Railway at Ordsall Lane in Salford. This was promoted as the South Junction Line. A branch line was also proposed, leaving the South Junction line at Castlefield (west of today’s Deansgate station) and following the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham. The Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway Act received Royal Assent on 21 July 1845.
The engineers were: Joseph Locke, George W. Buck and William Baker. Contracts were let on 23 Oct 1845 to David Bellhouse (South Junction) and John Brogden (Altrincham Branch). After some haggling over the price of land etc., a report of actual construction was presented on 30 Oct 1846. However work was then suspended as the company had run out of money. A public offering of five year bonds at 5% per annum raised only £50,000 so a further Act of Parliament (22 Jul 1848) was required to increase the capital by £250,000 to £650,000. The two owning companies each provided half of this amount. On 20 Jan 1849 a viaduct near Oxford Road collapsed as the scaffolding was removed. Three men died and two were injured. On the 25th the two adjacent arches failed without injury. The accepted reason was slow setting of mortar in wet weather.
In the end the Manchester Oxford Road to Altrincham line opened on 20 July 1849, and the South Junction portions from London Road to Oxford Road and from Castlefield Junction to Ordsall Lane were completed on 1 August 1849. In September 1849 the southern terminus was extended a short distance beyond Altrincham to Bowdon.
Services in the steam era.
In the 19th Century the area between Manchester and Altrincham was not intensively settled. It was essentially farming and market gardening country and Altrincham itself was a small market town. The first steam trains operated an hourly service, although this was increased as traffic developed.
In the first forty years or so, most Altrincham trains terminated at Oxford Road station in Manchester, with only a minority extended to the main line terminal at London Road. From the 1890s onwards, most trains were extended to run to London Road, although by this time passenger trains had been withdrawn from the South Junction route to Ordsall Lane.
Following the consolidation of the smaller railway companies in the mid-19th century, the MSJ&AR passed to joint ownership by the "London and North Western Railway" (LNWR) and the "Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway" (MSLR), which was the successor of the "Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester" and the predecessor of the "Great Central Railway". Frequent disagreements between the two owners resulted in the appointment of a full-time independent arbiter to resolve disputes and ensure the day-to-day functioning of the railway. 
The MSJ&AR owned its own coaches, but the haulage was provided by locomotives belonging to both the L&NWR and MS&LR companies. The MSJ&AR steam trains were unusual in retaining three classes of passenger accommodation well after most other British companies had dispensed with second class.
On 3 April 1881 the original stations at Bowdon and Altrincham were closed and replaced by a new station located between the two called Altrincham and Bowdon, at the location of today’s Altrincham Interchange. Also in 1881 the terminus at the other end of the line at London Road was rebuilt as a curved island platform connected to the main-line station via a footbridge. This arrangement survives today as the busy platforms 13 and 14 at Manchester Piccadilly.
1500 V DC electrification.
In the early part of the 20th Century, the MSJ&AR steam trains came under increasing competition from electric tramways, which by that time ran the whole way from Manchester to Altrincham and closely followed the route of the railway.
Various electrification proposals were studied to counter this threat, although it was only after the 1923 Grouping that concrete action was taken. Following Grouping, ownership and management of the line was taken over by an MSJ&AR Committee, representing both the "London, Midland and Scottish Railway" (LMS) and the "London and North Eastern Railway" (LNER). The LNER was particularly interested in the electrification of main-line railways and in 1928 a government report had recommended 1500 V DC overhead as the national standard system. 
Despite the LNER’s enthusiasm for electric traction, the LMS was the company responsible for installing most of the new electrification infrastructure on the line, while twenty-two new 3-car electric multiple units (EMUs) were built for the line by Metropolitan-Cammell to an LMS design. The new rolling stock was wooden frame construction and a conservative design, with individual compartments throughout (without corridors) and offering both first and third-class accommodation. The electric multiple units were all based at a new depot, located just south of Altrincham and Bowdon station on the site of the original MSJ&AR Bowdon terminus.
The new trains began test runs in 1930 and on Monday 11 May 1931 the London Road to Altrincham local service became fully electric. Coinciding with the electric service, new suburban stations were opened at Dane Road and Navigation Road. The station formerly called "Old Trafford Cricket Ground" (which had opened only for matches at the nearby Lancashire County Cricket Club, or Manchester United football ground) was opened full-time and renamed Warwick Road.
The Altrincham Electrics provided a faster, more frequent service than the steam trains they had replaced, and resulted in an 89% increase in patronage on the line within the first five years. The new electric service also stimulated further suburban housing development close to the line, and provided an early example of today’s marketing taglines when the railway’s publicists dubbed the initials "MSJ&AR" as "Many Short Journeys and Absolute Reliability."
As well as local trains, the Altrincham Electrics also provided express services at certain times of day, making use of a four-track section of line between Sale and Old Trafford. Some of the all-station electric trains ran only between Manchester and Sale, while steam-hauled passenger and goods trains also used the MSJ&AR to travel to destinations beyond the boundaries of electrification at either end of the line. Passenger trains ran from the ex-Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) line from Chester Northgate to Manchester Central, diverging from the MSJ&AR at Cornbrook Junction. There was also a local service from the ex-LNWR line from Warrington Arpley, via Lymm which terminated at Manchester London Road.
The success of the MSJ&AR and the reliability of the 1500 V DC distribution encouraged the LNER to pursue further electrification. These projects were disrupted and delayed by World War II, but in 1954 the first main-line electric railway in northern Britain, was completed from Sheffield Victoria to Manchester London Road via the Woodhead route, using 1500 V DC overhead. This line approached London Road from the east and although it was equipped with the same electrification system as the MSJ&AR and had its own fleet of 1500 V DC suburban EMUs (later to be classified as Class 506), the two electric lines were never connected at London Road and the two types of EMU never ventured onto each other’s territory.
In common with most railway routes, passenger traffic on the MSJ&AR declined significantly in the 1960s as travel patterns changed and more people had access to private cars. As a result, the Altrincham Electric express services were withdrawn, along some of the rolling stock and many of the goods trains using the route. The quadruple section of MSJ&AR track was reduced to conventional double track in 1963 and Manchester Central station closed on 5 May 1969, with trains from the ex-CLC Chester and Warrington lines being diverted to terminate at Oxford Road.
Conversion to 25 kV AC.
In the 1950s, British Railways chose 25 kV 50 Hz AC overhead in place of 1500 V DC as the standard for all future main line electrification outside the Southern Region. In September 1960 the first stage of the electrified West Coast Main Line opened between Manchester and Crewe, using 25 kV AC system. At the same time, Manchester London Road station was extensively rebuilt (including the MSJ&AR platforms) and was renamed Manchester Piccadilly. From 15 September 1958 all Altrincham trains were cut back to the bay platform at Oxford Road to allow the reconstruction to proceed at London Road. The short section between Piccadilly and Oxford Road stations was converted to 25 kV AC, and on 21 September 1960, suburban services from the Styal and Stockport lines began to use Oxford Road as their city terminus. 
Despite years of providing "many short journeys and absolute reliability", by the late 1960s the Altrincham Electrics were approaching forty years of age. Rather than replace them with new rolling stock operating on the non-standard 1500 V DC system, the decision was made to withdraw the trains and convert the whole Altrincham line to 25 kV AC. The last 1500 V DC train was the 23.35 from Oxford Road on Friday 30 April 1971. Altrincham depot closed and all the 1931 rolling stock (provisionally assigned to Class 505 by British Rail) was withdrawn from service.
On Monday 3 May 1971, a 15-min interval service was introduced from Altrincham, running through Manchester Piccadilly to Alderley Edge and Crewe. The unique 40-year-old, three-car Altrincham Electrics were replaced by 12-year-old, four-car Class 304 25 kV AC EMUs, based at Longsight depot. Three of the 1931 stock centre trailer cars were preserved and two are now undergoing restoration at the Midland Railway - Butterley in Derbyshire. However none of the motor coaches was preserved.
Following conversion in 1971, the AC services on the Altrincham line continued relatively unchanged for the next twenty years. 
Conversion to Metrolink.
The Manchester Metrolink is a Light Rail scheme introduced in the Manchester area in the early 1990s with the aims of reducing traffic congestion by providing modern, attractive public transport options for journeys into the city centre, and offering more convenient interchange between the rail systems north and south of the city. Phase I of Metrolink involved converting the British Rail lines from Victoria to Bury and Piccadilly to Altrincham to light rail operation, and linking the two by a street running section through Manchester city centre.
The conversion of the Altrincham line to Metrolink was originally stated to require no more than six weeks. The line was actually closed for approximately six months, during which time both all-stations and a rush-hour express (first stop Sale) substitute bus services were provided. The last conventional service 25 kV AC train on the MSJAR was the 21.05 Oxford Road to Altrincham on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1991. The line reopened on 15 June 1992, with Metrolink light rail vehicles running from Altrincham through Manchester’s city streets to Piccadilly and Bury.
During rebuilding a number of changes were made to infrastructure along the MSJ&AR route.
Following opening of Metrolink, a 12-minute frequency service was provided between Altrincham and Piccadilly, enhanced at peak hours by a second 12-minute headway service from Altrincham to Bury via Manchester City Centre. However passenger demand off-peak for the new light rail service proved stronger than expected, not least due to the availability of concessionary fares for students and pensioners on Metrolink in common with local bus services. Consequently, the 6-minute frequency was subsequently extended to operate all day Monday to Saturday, with trams alternating to Piccadilly and Bury. By contrast, peak-hour demand proved lower than originally forecast due to fare increases over those previously in force for British Rail services.

Zollgrenzschutz

Zollgrenzschutz (ZGS) () was an organization under the German Finance Ministry from 1937 to 1945. It was charged with guarding Germany's borders, acting as a combination Border Patrol and Customs & Immigration service. 
It originated in the early 19th century as a tariff enforcement unit of the Prussian government. 
Reorganized in 1919 under the Weimar Republic following World War I, it gradually became more militarized and transformed into a paramilitary force, also due to the economic woes of blockade, inflation and Great Depression.
In Nazi Germany it was reformed again in 1937 by Fritz Reinhardt, a State Secretary of the Finance Ministry. Himmler tried unsuccessfully to get it under the control of his SS. During the war, the units were used in occupied territories outside of Germany. In July, 1944 they were placed under the control of the Sicherheitspolizei. It was later deactivated at the end of World War II when Germany was partitioned.

Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse

The Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse is a French orchestra based in Toulouse. It acts as both a symphony orchestra whose main residence is Toulouse's Halle aux Grains, and the permanent orchestra of the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse. 
Initially with the name "Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse", past music directors of the orchestra have included André Cluytens (beginning in 1932) and Georges Prêtre (1951–1955). The Orchestre du Capitole rose to prominence during Michel Plasson's tenure as music director, from 1968 to 2003.
In 1974, Plasson chose the Halle aux Grains, a former market converted into an arena, to become the orchestra's residence. Until then, the orchestra was not used to giving concerts but was instead confined to the Capitole's pit, and had a very low reputation. Within twelve years, the orchestra had improved enough to qualify to have the term "national" in its name, which it acquired in 1980.
Plasson's flamboyant personality, his insistence on playing and recording the French repertoire, especially rarely played pieces, and his record deal with EMI, combined to make the orchestra the "reference" French orchestra, the most visible and most visibly French, with approximately one hundred records released. Natalie Dessay made her debut with the Capitole and still performs regularly with the orchestra.
On May 9, 2003, Plasson announced his decision not to renew his contract after August 31, 2003. He complained that planned works in the Halle aux Grains would impair the 2003-2004 concert season. Unofficially, his departure was caused by the city's refusal to increase the orchestra's payroll. In 2004, Plasson was made "honorary conductor" of the orchestra.
In 2005, the city named Tugan Sokhiev principal guest conductor and musical adviser of the orchestra. Sokhiev became the orchestra's music director in September 2008.
In 2011 the French national paper 'Le Figaro' reviewed the top 25 orchestras in France. The Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse was listed as one of the top three orchestras in France, one of the so-called 'Trio de l'excellence'. Also included in this top tier group were the Orchestre de Paris, and the orchestra of the Opera National de Paris.

The Baron in the Trees

The Baron in the Trees () is a 1957 Italian novel by Italo Calvino. Described as a conte philosophique and a metaphor for independence, it tells the adventures of a boy who climbs up a tree to spend the rest of his life inhabiting an arboreal kingdom.
Plot.
The story of twelve-year-old Cosimo Piovasco di Rondò is narrated by his younger brother, Biagio. Set in Liguria near the French Riviera, the two brothers belong to a noble 18th-century family whose estate is located in the vast forest landscapes of Ombrosa. The regions of Italy have not yet united and the Ligurian Coast is not ruled by a legitimate king. 
In a rebellious fight after refusing to eat a dinner of snails prepared by Battista, his sadistic sister, Cosimo climbs up a tree and decides never to come down again. He has literally had enough: enough of family and decorum, his proper role as a future Baron, and of everything on the ground. Initially helped and sometimes cared for by Biagio, the young Baron eventually becomes self-sufficient but finds that the more he distances himself from others in order to see them from a new point of view, the more he helps everyone on the earth. His love for a young woman named Viola changes the course of the lives of everyone: Cosimo, Viola, Biagio, and the community of Ombrosa.
Reception.
"The Baron in the Trees" is the second volume in the fantasy trilogy, "Our Ancestors" with "The Cloven Viscount" (1952) and "The Nonexistent Knight" (1959) comprising the first and third volumes, respectively. The novel received the prestigious Viareggio Prize in 1957.
On publication, various Italian critics complained of "the 'tired' feel of the plot in the second half of the novel" while distinguished novelist and critic Elio Vittorini considered the "stylistic disunity between the early and later chapters" was a problem. Despite these perceived flaws, critic Martin McLaughlin argues that the novel "remains something of a tour de force in Calvino's oeuvre. It is an extraordinarly successful attempt to reproduce a utopian, philosophical "conte" for the 1950s, with a whole range of intertextual allusions and a sophisticated parody of the poetics of the early English moralising novel as practised by Richardson and parodied by Fielding".
Together with "If on a Winter's Night, a Traveller" (1979), "The Baron in the Trees" is Calvino's biggest-selling work of fiction.

Mandatory frequency airport

An airport with a mandatory frequency (MF), mandatory traffic advisory frequency (MTAF) or air/ground radio (A/G) is an airport which does not have a control tower but still requires arriving and departing aircraft to communicate with other aircraft or a radio operator on a published frequency.
Mandatory frequency airports are rare in the United States, one example being Ketchikan International Airport (), but they are common in other countries such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Norway; often, an MF or MTAF airport is one with scheduled passenger service but insufficient traffic to support a control tower. If there is a flight service specialist monitoring the frequency, the specialist will give pilots advisories about traffic, weather, and surface conditions, and may relay IFR clearances from en route controllers, but cannot give clearances him- or herself.
In the United Kingdom, this type of airport is said to have an Air/Ground Radio service, using the callsign suffix "Radio". This is provided at airports that have a moderate level of VFR-only GA traffic.
Some examples of MF airports in Canada include Kingston/Norman Rogers Airport and Kuujjuaq Airport.

Bönnigheim

Bönnigheim is a town in the German administrative district (Kreis) of Ludwigsburg which lies at the edge of the areas known as "Stromberg" and "Zabergäu". The nearest large towns are Ludwigsburg and Heilbronn.
Geography.
Districts of the town
The town includes the previously separate parishes of Hofen and Hohenstein. The boundaries established on 31 December 1971, saw the inclusion of the property known as the Burgermühle and the lost village of Birlingen. The former parish of Hofen now comes under the village of Hofen. In the same way, the former parish of Hohenstein now comes under the village of that name.
History.
Development of the town
The first documentary reference to Bönnigheim occurs in the Lorsch codex. In a document dated 16 February 793, the nun Hiltburg bequeathed the parishes of Bönnigheim, Erligheim and Alt-Cleebronn to the abbey of Lorsch, and it was due to this bequest that Bönnigheim fell to the bishopric of Mainz. The monastery of Hirsau later bought the village as a fief and sold it in 1284 to the monastery of Bebenhausen.
Ganerbentum.
In the same year, Bönnigheim was granted the status of a so-called "Ganerbentum" (community of joint owners), and in 1288 the fief was passed to Rudolf von Habsburg, who in turn granted it to his son, Albrecht von Löwenstein-Schenkenberg, in 1291. The estate that had emerged from the so-called "Ganerbentum", which lasted until 1750, became partitioned through inheritance, marriage and purchase.
During this time the ownership of the town, which still came under the rule of the bishopric of Mainz, was subdivided between four noble families - the Lords of Sachsenheim, Liebenstein, Gemmingen and Neipperg. Each of the heirs became entitled to a quarter of the town. The same hereditary circumstances prevailed in nearby Erligheim. 
It is impossible for a town to be divided into four parts without this also impinging on the life of the community. Furthermore, it is hardly surprising that such a situation should also give rise to quarrels between the heirs themselves. Accordingly, a local truce was agreed in 1388, thus giving Bönnigheim its first bylaws. Under the terms of this truce, the four heirs agreed that a so-called ‘Baumeister’ would be elected from their ranks every two years (later every three years) who would be responsible for the administration of the town. The ‘Baumeister’ took up residence in the castle. Also established as part of this agreement was the election of the town council and of the mayor, as well as the appointment of a bailiff. During the Peasants Revolt, the castle was burnt down. It was rebuilt in 1546, only to be partially torn down again in 1697. The castle remains in this latter state today.
Modern era.
In 1750, Earl Friedrich von Stadion purchased the town and so brought to an end the Garnerbentum era. In 1756, Bönnigheim passed to Württemberg via its purchase by Duke Carl Eugen. Here it became part of the old administrative district of Besigheim which, in turn, came under the administrative district (Landkreis) of Ludwigsburg in 1938.
Religion.
Apart from the Protestant and Roman Catholic congregations, the population also includes those of the New Apostolic faith. 
Governance.
Town council.
The local election held on 7 June 2009 resulted in a Council consisting of 18 members. The turnout was 54.64%. The result of the election was as follows.
The chairperson of the Council is the mayor.
Arms and flag.
The town’s colours are white and red and have been thus since 1921 at least.
The arms of the incorporated parishes are:
The arms and flag were approved on 7 October 1966.
The arms and flag were approved on 19 August 1965.
Twin towns.
Bönnigheim is twinned with the following towns:
Notable buildings.
The signposted tour of the town includes some 50 listed buildings.
Economy and infrastructure.
Viticulture.
Wine has been produced in Bönningheim since written records began.
The "Strombergkellerei" is the wine-growing co-operative for Bönnigheim, Kirchheim am Neckar, Hohenhaslach and Erligheim.
The vineyard of Ernst Dautel is known outside the region for quality wine, in particular for Spätburgunder und Lemberger.
Industry.
Amann.
The industrial age did not reach Bönnigheim until 1 November 1854, when Alois Amann (1824 – 1892) and Immanuel Böhringer (1822 – 1906) established a firm for the production of twisted and dyed silk yarns in a house which had previously been a private school for boys.
By 1 December of the same year, two winding machines and a cleaning machine were in operation, as well as a twisting-machine. The firm’s modest production together with some purchased yarn was dyed at the Rau dyeing works in Berg before being taken to Bönnigheim where it was wound onto a bobbin and finished by twelve women. Two men turning a wheel provided the motive power. However, by 1855 manpower had proved insufficient and two donkeys (later two oxen) were used to drive a horse mill. In the same year, the black dyeing process was transferred in-house and additional machinery of various kinds was acquired. The following year saw the arrival of four new twisting machines, six additional winders and more washing and bobbin machines: the power source for these was a four-horsepower steam engine which replaced the oxen. In 1857, between 90 and 100 females were employed each earning 20 Gulden per year, rising to 25 Gulden after six months.
The firm flourished and expanded after the Franco-Prussian War war (1870-1871) and a bigger steam engine was installed. When the firm celebrated its silver jubilee in 1879 it had become the leading German manufacturer of silk sewing threads.
The early years of the 20th century saw the manufacture of surgical threads which were woven rather than twisted. In 1907 a new artificial silk was produced specifically for the manufacture of Plauen lace. With the main factory unable to cope with demand, another was set up at Mundelsheim in 1910. A new product was added to the Amann range in 1919 with the manufacture of schappe silk (silk waste) and in 1921 an extension was built to house the colour dyeing plant. The latter was overseen by Johannes Mecheels, whose son, Otto Mecheels, went on to establish the Hohenstein Institute, a textile research centre situated at the edge of Bönnigheim. In 1923, mercerised cotton thread was produced, followed two years later by crocheting thread made from artificial silk.
In 1931, Alfred Pielenz, the son-in-law of Alfred Amann, became a partner, finally taking sole control of the firm when his father-in-law retired in 1933. Production became difficult during the Second World War and was finally halted. However, within a few months of the end of hostilities, manufacturing restarted although full output was not attained until 1948 when the import of raw silk was again permitted. Alfred Pielenz was responsible for a major building extension programme during the post-war years. The German economic boom brought about a significant increase in the demand for sewing threads both at home and abroad and the firm was restructured accordingly. In 1959, 90% of the output consisted of thread made from natural sources, but by the end of the 1970s, the same percentage was being produced from synthetic fibres. Massive investment was required to bring the production up to date and ensure maximum rationalisation. A number of competitors were taken over and a central warehouse was established in the nearby village of Erligheim. The 1970s also saw production transferred overseas with factories opened in South Africa, Mexico and Spain, the output of the various plants being geared to the requirements of the individual markets.
The production was transferred from Bönnigheim in recent years and most of the buildings have been demolished. The firm is now known as the Amann Group but its head office remains in the town.
Textiles, along with agriculture and printing, still form the main manufacturing base of Bönnigheim.
Amann family – benevolence to the town.
Alfred Amann was known locally as the ‘soul of the town’ and gave large sums of money for the benefit of the local community. Within a year of entering the firm, Alfred, together with his mother, and brother, Emil, provided funds for a new chapel at the local cemetery which is still in use to this day. In 1902, he donated a swimming pool, which was up-dated and enlarged in 1933. In 1912, it was the turn of his former local school to benefit: a new school building was funded, thus creating for Bönnigheim its first 'Realschule' (secondary school). This was followed by a donation of 2,000 marks (ℳ) towards the education of gifted children of modest means. During the period of hyper-inflation in the Weimar Republic in 1921, Amann was the only firm in the area not to lay off workers: instead they built a track around the town's forest. More donations followed to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the firm's creation, to commemorate the death of his mother in 1913, his silver wedding in 1916 and his golden wedding in 1941. The marriage of his daughter in 1930 was marked by the gift of a new school building for the Volksschule (elementary school). An indoor sports centre was the gift of Alfred and his wife, Julie, on the occasion of his 70th birthday in 1933. It was his wish that workers be able to buy their own houses and, to this end, loans at low interest were granted to those able to prove that they had saved money. In 1933, 90 of his 128 married workers were house-owners; 16 of the 26 salaried technical staff were in the same position.
Hohenstein Institute.
The Mecheels family run a worldwide textile research and training centre, the Hohenstein Institute, at a nearby castle, Schloss Hohenstein. This organisation works for the clothing industry and in the fields of textile care and hospital hygiene.
Media.
The "Bönnigheimer Zeitung", is the local newspaper produced by Südwest-Presse. An independent news sheet "Nachrichtenblättle" reporting from the town halls of Bönnigheim, Kirchheim und Erligheim is published once a week.
Public institutions.
There is a retirement home and a care home, both run by Kleeblatt Pflegeheime.
Education.
All three sectors of the three-branch school system (Education in Germany) are present in Bönningheim: as its name implies, the Alfred Amann Gymnasium is a gymnasium. The Sophie La Roche Realschule is, of course, a realschule. The Ganerbenschule is both a grundschule and a hauptschule werkrealschule. In addition, there are three municipal nursery schools, two Protestant nursery schools and one Roman Catholic nursery school. There is also a municipal music school.

STS-125

STS-125, or HST-SM4 (Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 4), was the fifth and final space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
Launch occurred on 11 May 2009 at 2:01 pm EDT. Landing occurred on 24 May at 11:39 am EDT, with the mission lasting a total of just under 13 days.
The crew of STS-125 included three astronauts who had previous experience servicing Hubble.
Scott Altman visited Hubble in 2002 as commander of STS-109, the fourth Hubble servicing mission. John Grunsfeld, an astronomer, has serviced Hubble twice, performing a total of five spacewalks on STS-103 in 1999 and STS-109. Michael Massimino served with both Altman and Grunsfeld on STS-109, and performed two spacewalks to service the telescope.
NASA managers and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion of all the major objectives, as well as some that were not considered vital, upgraded the Hubble telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.
STS-125 was the first visit to the Hubble Space Telescope for "Atlantis"; the telescope had been previously serviced twice by "Discovery" and once each by "Columbia" and "Endeavour". The mission was the 30th flight of Space Shuttle "Atlantis" and the first flight of "Atlantis" in over 14 years (since STS-66) not to visit a space station.
Mission history.
The fifth servicing mission to Hubble, HST-SM4, was originally scheduled to launch in late 2005 or early 2006. On 16 January 2004, then-NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe canceled the mission, as well as any future missions to Hubble, citing safety constraints imposed by the "Columbia" Accident Investigation Board. During the announcement, O'Keefe stated that it was his decision alone, and not a recommendation from any other departments. The decision was widely criticized by the media, the science community, and those in NASA. Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, a member of the Senate subcommittee that oversees NASA's budget, publicly accused O'Keefe of making a decision outside the transparency process against the wishes of the science community, and stated she would work to reverse the decision. In March 2004, Representative Mark Udall introduced a bill to the House of Representatives that requested an independent panel of experts review O'Keefe's decision to cancel the servicing mission. Also in March 2004, Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Director Stephen Beckwith released the results of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field survey to the entire science community, which helped show the public how important Hubble was to science. The data showed the deepest images ever taken by a telescope and revealed approximately 10,000 galaxies, some of which most likely dated back to when the universe was just five hundred million years old. With Beckwith when he released the data to the scientific community was Mikulski, who said of the results, "I think it's just amazing... this is why I will continue to stand up for Hubble."
Joining Mikulski as an advocate for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who was present at the meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble servicing missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, and was very disappointed when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do the job. When O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.
O'Keefe's replacement, Michael D. Griffin, took just two months after his appointment to announce that he disagreed with O'Keefe's decision, and would consider sending a shuttle to repair Hubble. As an engineer, Griffin had previously worked on Hubble's construction, and respected the discoveries the telescope brought to the science community. He agreed with the National Academy of Sciences that a robotic mission was not feasible, and said that in light of the "Return to Flight" changes made following the "Columbia" accident, a shuttle mission to repair Hubble should be reassessed. After the successes of the Return to Flight STS-114 and STS-121 missions, and the lessons learned and improvements made following those missions, managers and engineers worked to formulate a plan that would allow the shuttle to service Hubble, while still adhering to the post-"Columbia" safety requirements.
On 31 October 2006, Griffin announced that the Hubble servicing mission was reinstated, scheduled for 2008, and announced the crew that would fly the mission, which included Grunsfeld. Senator Mikulski expressed her delight at the news, stating "The Hubble telescope has been the greatest telescope since Galileo invented the first one. It has gone to look at places in the universe that we didn't know existed before."
New Yorker and dedicated New York Mets fan, Mike Massimino, brought the home plate from Shea Stadium along on the mission. He was forced to slightly alter the plate to allow it to fit into the locker designated for memorabilia. Massimino presented the plate back to the Mets management upon return and threw out the first pitch there. The plate is now on display at Citi Field.
Mission payload.
The mission added two new instruments to Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, is now the most sensitive ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record a wide range of wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. "Atlantis" also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.
This will enable a spacecraft to be sent to the telescope to assist in its safe de-orbit at the end of its life. It is a circular mechanism containing structures and targets to aid docking.
The infrastructure of the telescope was upgraded by replacing a "Fine Guidance Sensor" that controls the telescope's directional system, installing a set of six new gyroscopes, replacing batteries, and installing a new outer blanket layer to provide improved insulation.
The payload bay elements were the Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier (SLIC) which held the Wide Field Camera 3, new batteries, and a radiator; the ORU Carrier which stored the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and FGS-3R instruments; the Flight Support Structure (FSS) which held onto the Hubble during repairs;, the Multi-Use Lightweight Equipment Carrier (MULE) which held support equipment and the Relative Navigation Sensor (RNS) Experiment.
Along with the collectible items that are flown on shuttle missions, such as mission patches, flags, and other personal items for the crew, were an official Harlem Globetrotters basketball and a basketball that Edwin Hubble used in 1909 when he played for the University of Chicago. After being returned to Earth, the Harlem Globetrotters basketball would be placed in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would be returned to the University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reprint of Galileo's "Sidereus Nuncius" from the library of his alma mater, MIT.
IMAX movie.
At the end of September 2007, Warner Bros. Pictures and IMAX Corporation announced that in cooperation with NASA, an IMAX 3D camera would travel to the Hubble telescope in the payload bay of Atlantis for production of a new film that will chronicle the story of the Hubble telescope. An IMAX camera was also stationed at the LC-39 Press Site for the launch. IMAX has made a number of movies centered around space, including "Destiny in Space", "The Dream Is Alive", "Mission to Mir", "Blue Planet", "", and "Space Station 3D", made in 2001 on the first trip of IMAX to the ISS. The movie was released in March 2010, with the name "IMAX: Hubble 3D".
Media.
Astronaut Michael J. Massimino used Twitter to document the training and preparations for the mission. He mentioned that he would like to try sending Twitter updates from space during his off-duty time.
Massimino's first update read, "From orbit: Launch was awesome!! I am feeling great, working hard, & enjoying the magnificent views, the adventure of a lifetime has begun!" Massimino was the first person to use Twitter in space.
Mission background.
The mission marked:
Shuttle processing.
STS-125 was first assigned to "Discovery" with a launch date no earlier than May 2008. This originally moved the mission ahead of STS-119, ISS Assembly flight 15. Delays to several shuttle missions resulted in a change in mission ordering, and the orbiter was changed to "Atlantis" on 8 January 2007. The crew of "Atlantis" went to the Kennedy Space Center for the Crew Equipment Interface Test in early July 2008. This allowed the STS-125 crew to get familiar with the orbiter and the hardware they would be using during the flight.
Launch delays.
On 22 August 2008, after a delay following Tropical Storm Fay, "Atlantis" was rolled from the Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building, where it was mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of "Atlantis" to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.
STS-125 was further pushed back to October 2008 due to manufacturing delays on external tanks for future space shuttle missions. Lockheed Martin experienced delays during the production changes to make new external tanks with all the enhancements recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, making it impossible for them to produce two tanks for the STS-125 mission–one for "Atlantis", and one for "Endeavour" for an emergency rescue mission, if necessary–in time for the original August launch date.
The first rollout to Launch Pad 39A occurred on 4 September 2008. On 27 September, the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling (SIC&DH) Unit on the Hubble Space Telescope failed. Because of its importance to the telescope, NASA postponed the launch of STS-125 on 29 September until 2009 so the failed unit could be replaced as well. "Atlantis" was rolled back to the Vehicle Assembly Building on 20 October.
On 30 October 2008, NASA announced that "Atlantis" would be removed from its solid rocket boosters and external tank stack and sent back to the Orbiter Processing Facility to await a targeted launch time at 1:11 pm EDT on 12 May 2009. The stack was turned over to be used on the STS-119 mission instead. On 23 March, "Atlantis" was mated to its new stack in the Vehicle Assembly Building, and rolled out to Launch Pad 39A on 31 March. On 24 April 2009, NASA managers issued a request to move the STS-125 launch up one day to 11 May at 2:01 pm EDT. The change was made official at the flight readiness review on 30 April.
The reason cited for the change was to add one more day to the launch window, from two to three days.
Mission timeline.
11 May (Flight day 1, launch).
Following a smooth countdown, "Atlantis" launched on time at 2:01 pm EDT.
Almost immediately after launch and during the ascent, flight systems reported problems with a hydrogen tank transducer and a circuit breaker; the crew was immediately advised to disregard the resultant alarms and continue to orbit.
During the post-launch news conference, NASA managers said the initial early review of the launch video showed no obvious debris events, but a thorough analysis would be performed to ensure the orbiter sustained no significant damage during ascent.
After working through their post launch checklists, the crew opened the payload bay doors, deployed the Ku band antenna, and moved into the robotic activities portion of the day, which included a survey of the payload bay and crew cabin survey with the orbiter's robotic arm.
During the post-launch inspection of Launch Pad 39A, a twenty-five foot area on the north side of the flame deflector was found to have damage where some of the heat resistant coating came off.
Following the launch of STS-124, severe damage was seen at the pad where bricks were blasted from the walls, but NASA officials stated the damage from the STS-125 launch was not nearly as severe and should not impact the launch of STS-127 in June.
12 May (Flight day 2).
Following the morning wake up call, the crew set right to work on the day's tasks, which were centered on inspection of the orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.
Mission managers called up to the crew to alert them of the find, advising Altman ("Scooter") that one of the orbiter's wing leading edge sensors recorded a debris event during ascent, around 104 – 106 seconds following liftoff, which may have been the cause of the damage seen in that area.
CAPCOM Dan Burbank advised the crew that the damage did not initially appear to be serious, but assured the crew that the image analysis team would be reviewing the imagery further, and engineers on the ground would be analyzing it to determine if a focused inspection would be required.
As part of the Flight Day 2 Execute Package, ground engineers also provided further information on the circuit breaker failure seen at launch.
The breaker (Channel 1 Aerosurfaces, ASA 1) is part of the shuttle's Flight Control Systems (FCS), a subsystem of the Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) systems. The failure would have no impact to the mission, due to redundant systems.
In addition to the survey of the orbiter's heat shield, the crew gathered and inspected the EVA tools and spacesuits that would be used for the mission's spacewalks and prepared the Flight Support System (FSS) for berthing with Hubble on flight day three.
13 May (Flight day 3).
Following the crew's post-sleep activities, they went to work performing the rendezvous operations that included burning the orbiter's engines to refine the approach to the Hubble telescope. Following some delays due to communications issues, Altman and Johnson ("Ray-J") guided the orbiter within fifty feet of the telescope. McArthur successfully grappled Hubble at 17:14 UTC, and at 18:12 the telescope was safely berthed in the payload bay of "Atlantis". Later in the day, Grunsfeld and Feustel (Drew), along with Good ("Bueno") and Massimino ("Mass") worked on preparing for the next day's spacewalk, gathering tools and checking out the suits and equipment that would be used during the EVA.
At the Mission Management Team (MMT) briefing, MMT Chairman LeRoy Cain reported that the damage assessment team had cleared all of the orbiter's TPS tiles and blankets, and were expected to clear the RCC portion of the orbiter by flight day four. He stated that no focused inspection would be required. Cain also noted that a debris event was recorded on the orbiter's wing leading edge sensors, but it was far below the force that would indicate a problem, and would not impact the mission. The late inspection that is routinely performed prior to re-entry would give any additional information, but Cain stated "We're not concerned that it's done any kind of damage that would be any concern to us, certainly not critical damage."
During the Mission Status briefing, Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that during the camera survey of the equipment in the payload bay, the team noticed some fine particulate matter around the box containing the Wide Field Camera 3 and asked the crew to take additional images using a higher resolution camera for the ground teams to assess. Cain later confirmed that the dust was not present prior to launch, and was most likely particulate shaken loose from the thick insulation blankets inside the payload bay during launch. The team advised the crew to avoid the particulate as much as possible during the spacewalks, and use caution when working around the container to avoid the debris, but it was not a significant concern.
14 May (Flight day 4).
Following the crew's wake up, they set to work preparing for the mission's first spacewalk. Grunsfeld and Feustel suited up with the assistance of their EVA counterparts, Massimino and Good, and the spacewalk officially began when the two switched their suits to battery power at 12:52 UTC. At the start of the spacewalk, Feustel provided managers on the ground with a visual inspection report on the particulate matter seen earlier around the WFC3 box, reporting to the ground team that "I don't really see any of those particles...It's almost imperceivable. I can see some few particles on the front of the W-SIPE, little, whitish, grey looking, real small. It's low density, too." After getting their tools and equipment for the EVA set up, Grunsfeld and Feustel removed the old Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, which was installed in 1993 during the telescope's first servicing mission, and replaced it with the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Feustel initially had trouble removing the bolts from the old camera, which after over fifteen years in space required more torque to remove than expected. After multiple attempts, managers on the ground decided to have Grunsfeld get a contingency torque limiter from the airlock, which would allow Feustel to apply more force without exceeding a specific point, but the bolt would still not release. The concern was that the bolt would shear, and the camera would be unable to be removed should that happened. Finally, managers approved Feustel to remove the limiter, and apply as much force as he safely thought it would take to release the bolt, which was successful.
The new camera will allow Hubble to take large-scale, extremely clear and detailed photos over a wider range of colors than the old camera did. After the installation, controllers at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center sent commands to the camera to perform an aliveness test, which passed, indicating the camera was installed correctly.
The next task was to remove and replace the telescope's Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, or SIC&DH, a computer that sends commands to Hubble's science instruments, and formats science data for transmission to the ground. This was the item that failed in September 2008, delaying STS-125 while engineers prepared a replacement part for the mission, and the crew trained for the new task. While the failure of the SIC&DH did not disable the telescope, replacing the unit restores the redundancies. The final major task was to install the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM), which includes the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that will allow spacecraft in the future to dock with the telescope, and to safely de-orbit the telescope at the end of its life. Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than I was when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished."
15 May (Flight day 5).
Following their wake up, the "Atlantis" crew set right to work preparing for the second spacewalk of the mission, with Massimino and Good suiting up with assistance from Grunsfeld and Feustel. As they were preparing for the EVA, the team on the ground informed the crew that the WFC3 had passed all the overnight functional tests, indicating it was in good working order.
While the spacewalk preparations were underway, Altman and McArthur completed a robotic survey of a small row of heat shield tiles that had not been sufficiently imaged during the day two inspection. Following the analysis of the survey, the managers cleared all of the TPS systems until the pre-landing inspection.
The mission's second spacewalk officially began at 12:49 UTC, and the pair set to work removing and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into the third and final bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.
The problems with seating the second RSU set the spacewalkers back in the timeline by approximately two hours, but after Altman asked Massimino and Good how they felt, they replied they were doing well and felt fine to continue. Flight controllers on the ground evaluated the consumables for the two spacesuits, and decided that if Massimino recharged his suit's oxygen in the airlock, the pair could safely continue with the battery installation. After moving to the battery unit site, Good and Massimino removed one of the original battery modules from Bay 2 of the telescope, and replaced it with a new unit. The batteries provide power to the telescope when it passes into the Earth's shadow and its solar arrays are not exposed to the sun. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:45 UTC, for a time of seven hours, fifty-six minutes. It was the twentieth spacewalk to service Hubble, bringing the total time in EVA servicing the telescope to one hundred forty-four hours and twenty-six minutes.
During the mission status briefing, Tomas Gonzalez-Torres, the Lead EVA Officer, and Hubble Program Manager Preston Burch both explained that the spare RSU would not impact the life of the telescope, as it had been fully refurbished on the ground with two of the three improvements incorporated in newer models. "I would say the difference in the projected longevity of the observatory in the out years is very small. We don't see this is a significant detriment at all to the observatory. This was a tremendous accomplishment for us." Burch noted. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that due to the length of the spacewalk, and the resulting slip in the timeline, the crew's sleep shift would have to be moved an hour later, to allow them to get the proper amount of rest, and the rest of the docked timeline would also be shifted forward an hour.
16 May (Flight day 6).
After awakening, the crew set to work preparing for the mission's third spacewalk, one that was considered the most challenging and uncertain, yet had some of the highest priority items scheduled. The tasks were to remove the obsolete Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR), originally installed during STS-61 to correct the spherical aberration of Hubble's mirror, and install the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), and to repair the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The ACS failed in June 2006 due to an electrical issue, and after being restored partially, failed again in 2007 due to an electrical short. The ACS was not designed to be serviced or repaired in space, so the task was considered one of the most challenging of the mission. After running into various snags in the first two spacewalks, managers on the ground were prepared to see unexpected issues arise during the complicated repair work. The spacewalk began at 13:35 UTC, and Grunsfeld and Feustel had no problems. The pair worked through their timeline so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead at one point. After removing COSTAR and stowing it in the orbiter's payload bay, they installed COS, and then moved on to the ACS repair. Using specially designed tools, they removed an access panel, replaced the camera's four circuit boards, and installed a new power supply.
The spacewalk was completed in six hours and thirty-six minutes, and the ACS passed the initial aliveness tests. It was the twenty-first Hubble servicing spacewalk, and Grunsfeld's seventh EVA, moving him up to fourth in the record book of spacewalking time. During the previous day's mission status briefing, Dave Leckrone, Hubble Space Telescope Senior Project Scientist, made a prediction, joking that since the first two spacewalks, which were considered to be straightforward, had run into issues, the most difficult EVA – to repair the ACS, would be the smoothest one of the mission. "I have a prediction, We've always said EVA 3 was going to be the most difficult and the most challenging, and I predict it's going to go more smoothly than any other EVA on this mission. I just think that's some version of Murphy's Law that's going to lead us in that direction."
After the initial aliveness testing, the ACS was put through its functional tests. Managers and engineers had noted that the repairs were designed for only one of the three photo channels, the wide-field channel, and that the issues with the high-resolution channel may not be resolved by the designed fix. During the functional testing, the wide-field channel passed, but issues were seen with the high-resolution channel, indicating that the power issue may be farther upstream in the electronic circuits than the spacewalk repair addressed. Additional testing would be performed, but Hubble Program Manager Preston Burch noted that the fix was designed to "back power" the high-resolution channel through the paths connected to the wide-field channel, and while feasible, it was a possibility that the short circuit damage was in an area not corrected with the planned repair. Even if the high-resolution channel is unable to be restored, it was considered to be less important, since the bulk of the ACS science output is undertaken by the wide-field channel. The third channel, the solar-blind channel, passed overnight functional testing without issues.
17 May (Flight day 7).
Beginning the mission's fourth spacewalk at 13:45 UTC, Massimino and Good went to work repairing the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectrograph failed in 2004 due to a blown power supply. As with the ACS, the STIS was not designed with the intention of servicing it while in space, and one of the major challenges was to remove a cover plate held tight with over 100 screws using a specially designed tool called a fastener-capture plate, designed to trap the screws and washers and prevent them from floating into space when removed. While preparing the fastener-capture plate, Massimino encountered issues with a handrail that had to be removed to accommodate the fastener-capture plate. The handrail had a stripped bolt on the bottom, preventing it from being released. After trying multiple options without success, managers on the ground advised Massimino to use brute force to remove the handrail, so he could proceed with the removal of the cover plate. The procedure was tested at Goddard Space Flight Center prior to approving it, showing that the stripped bolt could be broken off safely using force. Working inside the orbiter, Feustel walked Massimino through the procedure slowly, advising him to tape the handrail with Kapton tape to prevent any parts from breaking off or flying loose, to be aware of the reaction the force would have, as well as to watch for sharp edges on the handrail after removal.
Once the handrail was removed, Massimino went to work attaching the capture plate, but ran into additional problems when the battery in one of his power tools failed. Massimino was instructed to return to the orbiter's airlock to retrieve a spare tool and to recharge his suit's oxygen reserves, to allow for completion of the STIS repair. The rest of the STIS repair work was completed without any problems, but the spacewalkers were nearly two hours behind the scheduled timeline, so managers on the ground decided to postpone the task of installing a New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs) onto the telescope's outer shell. The spacewalk, originally scheduled to last six hours and thirty minutes, ended at 21:02 UTC, for a time of eight hours and two minutes. At the time, it became the sixth longest spacewalk in history. It was the twenty-second spacewalk devoted to servicing the Hubble telescope, and Massimino's fourth spacewalk, bringing his total EVA time to thirty hours, forty-four minutes.
During the mission status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, noted that the repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as that part of the telescope performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.
After initial aliveness testing that showed no issues, STIS was taken into functional testing, and issues were seen when the telescope put itself into safe mode due to a low thermal limit sensor. Ground controllers at Goddard would restart the testing once the thermal limit sensor was back in normal sensor range, but it is believed the component is in good shape.
18 May (Flight day 8).
Completing the fifth of the five planned spacewalks, Grunsfeld and Feustel successfully installed the second battery, removed and replaced the Fine Guidance Sensor number three, and worked so efficiently that they were over an hour ahead of the timeline, giving them time to remove degraded insulation panels from three bays of the telescope, and install three New Outer Blanket Layers (NOBLs). Beginning the spacewalk at 12:20 UTC, the pair first worked on removing an aging battery module, and replaced it with a new pack, which combined with the battery replacement performed during the second spacewalk, gave the telescope all new nickel-hydrogen batteries. They then moved on to the removal and replacement of the Fine Guidance Sensor unit number three, improving Hubble's focus and stability when imaging. NASA engineers liken the new FGS to being able to keep a laser beam focused on a U.S. dime coin that is away. Both the new batteries, and the FGS passed both aliveness and functional testing. The mission's final EVA concluded at 19:22 UTC, after seven hours and two minutes. The total time spent during the mission in extra-vehicular activity was thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes. The twenty-third and final spacewalk to service Hubble brought the total time spent in EVA working on the telescope to one hundred and sixty-six hours, six minutes. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that the final EVA was also the last planned spacewalk from a shuttle airlock. In what was likely his last EVA, Grunsfeld's has accumulated fifty-eight hours and thirty minutes spacewalking, just two minutes less than Jerry L. Ross, who is third on the list of spacewalking time.
The completion of all the major objectives, as well as some that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not just seen in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last longer than that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.
19 May (Flight day 9).
After awakening at 8:31 UTC, the crew set to work preparing to release Hubble from the payload bay of "Atlantis". Using the shuttle's robotic arm, McArthur grappled Hubble at 10:45 UTC, and lifted it out of the orbiter's payload bay to prepare for the release. Good and Massimino were standing by ready to perform a spacewalk in the event that something went wrong during the telescope's deployment. After working through the checklist to prepare the telescope for release, managers on the ground gave the go to Altman to release Hubble, and at 12:57 UTC, McArthur successfully released the telescope as the vehicles flew over Africa. Performing a small separation burn, Johnson backed the orbiter away from the telescope, and Altman called down to managers on the ground confirming the deployment of Hubble. Commending the crew, Altman said "And Houston, Hubble has been released, it's safely back on its journey of exploration as we begin steps to conclude ours. Not everything went as we planned, but we planned a way to work around everything and with the whole team pulling together... we've been able to do some incredible things. And now Hubble can continue on its own, exploring the cosmos, and bringing it home to us as we head for home in a few days. Thank you." Hubble's new equipment and upgraded systems would be tested for several months prior to resuming operation, but if all tests are successful, operation of the telescope would resume in early September.
Following the separation burn, the crew set to work performing the standard late inspection of the thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early to try to avoid the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01 am EDT.
20 May (Flight day 10).
After a busy week servicing Hubble, the crew of "Atlantis" had the majority of the day off, giving them time to rest and prepare for landing. They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and the crew of "Atlantis" expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the work they do during their long duration stays on the station.
The Spaceflight Meteorology Group at Johnson Space Center was predicting less than favorable weather for Friday's landing, so managers asked the crew to power down some non-critical systems to help conserve power, in the event that the orbiter is not able to land until Saturday.
After evaluating the imagery sent down from the late inspection, the ground team officially cleared the orbiter's thermal protection system for re-entry. Initially, NASA had planned on releasing "Endeavour" from its stand-by status following the late inspection, but managers on the ground decided to wait until "Atlantis" had performed the de-orbit burn before standing down the STS-400 rescue mission officially.
Before going to sleep, the crew took a phone call from President Barack Obama, who congratulated them on their successful mission, joked with them, asking if they could see his house in Chicago, and expressed his pride in the crew. Obama told the crew, "Like a lot of Americans, I've been watching with amazement the gorgeous images you've been sending back, and the incredible repair mission you've been making in space," he said. "I think you're providing a wonderful example of the kind of dedication and commitment to exploration that represents America and the space program generally. These are traits that have always made this country strong, and all of you personify them."
21 May (Flight day 11).
The crew spent the day in preparations for Friday's landing. After working through their post-sleep activities, Altman, Johnson and McArthur performed a check-out of the flight control surfaces, performed a reaction control system hot-fire, and went through communications checks with managers on the ground. The rest of the crew worked to stow away items that were used during the mission. The crew held a deorbit preparations briefing with the ground teams, and Altman and Johnson worked with the simulator on board to run through a series of landing simulations.
In the afternoon, the crew became the first shuttle crew to ever testify live from orbit in a United States Senate hearing. Barbara Mikulski, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies, and former astronaut Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, spoke with the crew about the importance of spaceflight and the repair of Hubble. The first person to give testimony from space was John L. Phillips, who testified before the House Science Committee, Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics in June 2005 while a member of Expedition 11 on board the International Space Station. The crew of "Atlantis" later spoke with reporters from the major networks CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX before going to sleep.
While the weather in Florida continued to look grim for a landing Friday, managers on the ground advised the crew that they would proceed with deorbit preparations as planned, and see if the weather cleared up in the morning. NASA managers stated that for Friday, they would focus on a KSC landing for Friday, not activating any of the backup sites, but if the weather was not favorable for a Friday landing, Edwards Air Force Base could be activated on Saturday. "Atlantis" has enough consumables to stay in orbit until Monday.
Also late on Thursday, managers officially released "Endeavour" from its stand-by state, as "Atlantis" was cleared of any damage to its heat shield and was in good shape to return to Earth.
22 May (Flight day 12).
As the crew worked through the procedures and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew a total of six Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.
23 May (Flight day 13).
The crew of "Atlantis" had six possible landing opportunities on Saturday. Managers evaluated the best three opportunities of the day to try bring the orbiter home. Saturday's first landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center was waived due to poor weather forecasts, and observed weather violations for the landing criteria. After further evaluating weather patterns around Florida, managers on the ground chose to waive the second opportunity as well, and wait one more day to attempt to get the orbiter into Florida on Sunday. Weather in California had excellent forecasts, so if the attempts on Sunday to land in Florida were not successful, the shuttle would be able to land at Edwards Air Force Base without weather being an issue.
24 May (Flight day 14, landing).
The "Atlantis" crew had two Florida return opportunities for the day, as well as two for a California landing, giving the managers time to evaluate the weather and use California if necessary. After choosing to pass on the first opportunity for KSC and evaluate the second, managers on the ground decided that the weather in Florida was too dynamic to risk bringing the orbiter in, and opted to land at Edwards Air Force Base instead. The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, a burn of the shuttle's engines that brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. "Atlantis" successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39 am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2 million miles.
After working through the checklists to safely power down the orbiter, the crew performed the traditional walk-around of the shuttle and met with employees from NASA. Speaking briefly to the press following the walk around, Altman joked, "I didn't realize it was going to be so hard to get back to the Earth! We're all thrilled to have the mission complete."
During the post-landing briefing, Associate Administrator for Space Sciences Ed Weiler declared the mission a total success, and after noting the rocky road that it took to get the mission completed, said he considered the mission to be Hubble's Great American Comeback story, chapter two.
Post landing.
Following standard post-landing processing at Edwards Air Force Base, "Atlantis" was lifted into the air using the Mate-DeMate device, and attached to the top of a modified Boeing 747, called a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) for its return flight to Florida. After departing California on 1 June, the flight made an overnight stop at Biggs Army Airfield in El Paso, Texas, and on 2 June made stops in San Antonio, Texas, and Columbus, Mississippi to refuel. After performing a flyby of the coast, the SCA landed at Kennedy Space Center at 6:53 p.m EDT on 2 June 2009. One of the heavier return flights, "Atlantis" was still carrying the cargo from the mission in the payload bay, and weighed approximately one quarter of a million pounds. Combined with the 747, the total weight of the vehicle was approximately six hundred thousand pounds. "Atlantis" was removed from the SCA and towed to the Orbiter Processing Facility late 2 June.
Extra-vehicular activity.
Five back-to-back EVAs were planned for the mission. Spacewalks one through four were originally scheduled to last six hours, thirty minutes, while the fifth spacewalk was scheduled to last five hours, forty-five minutes. All five EVAs were conducted successfully, for a total time in EVA activity of thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes.
Wake-up calls.
NASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the Gemini program, which was first used to wake up a flight crew during Apollo 15. Each track is specially chosen, often by their families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.
Contingency mission.
STS-125 was the only planned shuttle mission after the "Columbia" accident to be launched into a low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with the International Space Station. Due to the inclination and other orbit parameters of Hubble, "Atlantis" would have been unable to use the International Space Station as a safe haven in the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-"Columbia" requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by "Endeavour" in the event "Atlantis" became disabled during STS-125. After "Atlantis" performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, "Endeavour" was officially released from stand-by status on Thursday, 21 May.

Tenase

In coagulation, the procoagulant protein factor X can be activated into factor Xa two ways; extrinsically or intrinsically.
The activating complexes are called tenase. Tenase is a contraction of "ten" and the suffix "-ase", which means, that the complex activate its substrate (inactive factor X) by cleaving it. 
Extrinsic tenase complex is made up of tissue factor, factor VII, and Ca2+ as an activating ion. 
Intrinsic tenase complex contains the active factor IX (IXa), its cofactor factor VIII (VIIIa), the substrate (factor X), and they are activated by negatively charged surfaces (such as glass, active platelet membrane, sometimes cell membrane of monocytes). These vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors dock to this surface through their Gla domain with Ca2+ bridges. This makes the activating process much faster and blocks the binding of inhibitors.

Bedfordshire clanger

The Bedfordshire Clanger is a dish from the county of Bedfordshire, in England. It is an elongated suet crust dumpling with a savoury filling at one end and a sweet filling at the other comprising a main course and dessert in one package.
The savoury end is traditionally meat with diced potatoes and vegetables (although a filling without meat is also possible), and the sweet end is usually jam, or sweetened apple or other fruit. Traditionally the top of the pasty is scored with a few lines to denote the sweet end.
Historically, the Bedfordshire Clanger was made by women for their husbands to take to their agricultural work as a midday meal. The dish is still available at various bakers and served at some hotels, restaurants and local places of interest.
A similar, but entirely savoury, dish comes from Buckinghamshire, known as the Buckinghamshire Bacon Badger it is made from bacon, potatoes and onions which are enclosed in a pastry case.

August Rei

August Rei VR III/1 ( in Kurla – 29 March 1963 in Stockholm) was an Estonian Social Democratic politician. He was born in Kurla Pilistvere Parish, Kreis Fellin, Governorate of Livonia (now Türi Parish, Järva County).
Education.
Rei studied in the Tartu Emperor Alexander High School (the former State High School of the Livonian Governorate), but graduated from the Novgorod State High School. In 1904–1905 and 1907–1911, studied law in the St. Petersburg University.

Cleveland Pipers

The Cleveland Pipers was an American industrial basketball team based in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1950s and early 1960s. The Pipers are most known for having played in the short-lived American Basketball League from 1961–62, arguably as that brief pro league's pivotal franchise. 
General Manager, Mike Cleary hired John McLendon, the first African American head coach in professional basketball, to lead the squad. Playing under coach John McLendon, and later coach Bill Sharman, the team won the league's 1962 championship, the only full season the league would ever have. 
The team had a number of interesting and notable moments. Future baseball legend George Steinbrenner got his start in professional sports ownership with the Pipers, which he bought from plumbing business owner Ed Sweeny to enter into the new ABL. Later, McClendon got a former college player he had coached, Dick Barnett, to jump from the NBA's Syracuse Nationals to the Pipers. Then, Steinbrenner, signed away Jerry Lucas from the NBA's Cincinnati Royals.
Even early on here, long before his days as boss of the baseball Yankees, Steinbrenner could be meddlesome and irrepressible. In a game against the Hawaii Chiefs, George Steinbrenner sold player Grady McCollum to the Chiefs at halftime.
NBA petition.
After team owner George Steinbrenner unsuccessfully petitioned to get the National Basketball Association to accept his team the following year, the Pipers disbanded. After the ABL folded, Steinbrenner had $125,000 in debts and personal losses of two million dollars.
Jerry Lucas.
In the spring of 1962, Cleveland Pipers owner George Steinbrenner signed Jerry Lucas to a player-management contract worth forty thousand dollars. With the Lucas signing, Steinbrenner had a secret deal with NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff.
According to Bill Madden's "Steinbrenner: The Last Lion of Baseball", Steinbrenner made plans in 1963 to acquire the Kansas City Steers, from the recently failed ABL, as part of an application to bring the Cleveland Pipers into the NBA, and a schedule had, supposedly, been printed for the 1963-64 NBA season with the Pipers playing the New York Knicks in the first game. Steinbrenner and partner George McKean fell behind in payments to the NBA and the deal was cancelled.
Players.
Lucas did not play in any ABL games. Pipers players include the following:

<doc id="5853629" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5853629" title="Virginal Young Blondes">
Virginal Young Blondes

Virginal Young Blondes is a short film by American director Mark L. Feinsod. It was shot in 2004 on mini-DV, and has a running time of 16 minutes.
Plot.
The movie opens with a shot of George W. Bush delivering the State of the Union address and cross-dissolves into a newspaper headline about the Madrid train bombings of 2004. The audio is composed primarily of a ringing telephone. A young man named John O'Hara (played by Andy Waldschmidt) is shown lying on his bed and looking depressed. The audio segues from the ringing phone to a conversation with his father wherein his father urges him to get a job and then, as if to undercut his son's confidence, offers to mail him a check. John, apparently bored, leaves the apartment, bringing the newspaper along with him.
The next scene takes place in a restaurant, as John enters and sits at the bar. A beautiful blonde sizes him up as he takes the stool next to her. After much glancing back and forth, she begins a conversation with him wherein she flatters him and, apparently mistaking him for being wealthy because he's not working and is reading the stock market section of the newspaper, tries to pick him up. John responds to her questions cautiously. She then hands him her business card, which reads "Sofia's Strip-o-Gram and Massage Service". Sofia (played by Melissa Silver) offers John a massage and a humorous exchange ensues. After he makes her laugh, she invites him to get stoned. John pays for both of their drinks, and the pair leaves.
There is a cross-dissolve to John and Sofia standing in front of a shop window, inside of which is a luxurious display of chocolates. John declares that "it's the most expensive chocolate shop in the world", to which an entranced Sofia replies, "I know". John, attempting to be charming, offers to buy them each a chocolate. Sofia, saying that she needs to check her messages, tells him to go in and pick something out for her. John, surprised, goes inside. The soundtrack then changes to that of people frolicking at the beach as John enters. As he approaches the counter, the audio again changes — this time to both an airport interior and a German voice repeating a phrase again and again. As John reaches the counter, the salesgirl wraps up two lemon-mousse finger sandwiches for him. In superimposition, the elaborate ritual of preparing the cakes is shown. John pays a whopping $42.50 for the two treats and leaves.
In the last scene, John and Sofia sit on the Brooklyn Bridge after having gotten stoned together. Sofia then opens up to John and tells him that she used to live with her ex-boyfriend and sometimes delivered drugs for him. She describes two trips that she took — one to a college in Vermont and another to Belgium and Prague. She then tells John the story of how her boyfriend was murdered and she was raped repeatedly by the killers. When John is shocked, she insists that she's fine now, as the event took place a year ago. John embraces her awkwardly, retracts his arm hurriedly, and then Sofia tells him to call her before leaving for an appointment. John then eats the cakes.
Themes.
The theme of not fitting into society and being left behind or forgotten is obviously the most prominent in the movie. John, despite seeming to come from a solid middle-class background of some kind, appears to have nothing to do during the day and no contact with anybody other than his father, whose urging of his son to get a job and then offering to send him money in and of itself manages to be both demeaning and helpful at the same time. His character is contrasted with that of Sofia, a drug dealer and sex worker whose background is far more tumultuous. Nevertheless, the two have in common that they seem to have been cast aside by society. Sofia, whose boyfriend was killed by rival drug dealers and who gives erotic massages and works as a dominatrix, appears to be completely alone in the same manner as John. Whereas John gets a call from a family member, Sofia checks her voice-mail messages and then declares that she has an appointment of some kind that she must go to (the inference is that she has to work in her capacity as either a masseuse or a dominatrix). That John's last name is O'Hara (as in the writer John O'Hara) also seems to back this up.
The movie also deals with the idea of duality or doubles. John and Sofia can be said to be flip sides of the same person — John is male and Sofia female; and John comes from a respectable background, whereas Sofia comes from the seedier side of life. John begins the movie by going from one place to another (from his apartment to the bar), while Sofia ends the movie by going from the Brooklyn Bridge to her appointment. Further confirming this is that Sofia, in fact, is played by two actresses — Melissa Silver plays her in a physical sense, while Marie-Line Grinda does her voice.
As in most of Feinsod's other work, 9/11 and its lingering memory is always present in some fashion. In Virginal Young Blondes, the movie opens with a shot of President Bush speaking at a State of the Union address on television, which is then slowly cross-dissolved with a shot of a New York Times headline about the Madrid train bombing of 2004. This then segues into a shot of John opening a letter of rejection from a company that he had applied for a job with, coupled with an audio re-creation of the New York State unemployment phone service line. Also, the last scene of the movie takes place on the Brooklyn Bridge with the Financial District visible in the background. Notable for its absence is, of course, the World Trade Center.

Christian Centre, Nottingham

The Christian Centre, Nottingham is a church located in Nottingham in England. It is one of the UK's larger churches, with around 1,400 people actively involved. The Christian Centre is a Pentecostal church affiliated to the Assemblies of God.
History.
The Christian Centre began as a small gathering of Christians meeting in a house in 1928 in the Lace Market. It quickly became a small church, growing steadily over the following decades and has been based at its current premises on Talbot Street since the 1970s. In September 2013, David Shearman finished as the Senior Leader of the Christian Centre after an amazing 45 years of faithful service.
Today.
Today, the church represents a wide range of ages, cultures and backgrounds. Malcolm and Lynette Baxter are the Senior Leaders, a position they have held since September 2013. 
The church has embarked on a multi-million pound project to build a new home, as its current building is at capacity, and multiple Sunday services must be run. The Christian Centre has achieved planning permission for a new building incorporating a 1600-seat auditorium building on land directly opposite its current site on the site of the former St. Matthew's Church, Talbot Street. The building will also feature a cafe, terrace, function rooms and prayer room with views across the Nottingham skyline.
One Church Many Locations.
The church has been located on Talbot Street since 1970. In 2012, it started meeting at a second location at Meadow Lane as part of its vision to be 'One Church in Many Locations'. The Church meets on a Sunday at 9.00am, 11.15am and 6.30pm at its Talbot Street campus, and at 10.00am at Meadow Lane.
Ministries.
The church has an extensive social responsibility programme, administered by charity 58i intended to reach the disadvantaged in the city and beyond through a number of different projects. Its members are also involved in international development work overseas, including support for The King's Village, a school and medical centre in Northern Ghana.
A wide range of activities run from the Christian Centre, including the Alpha Course, Children's ministry, Destiny for 13-18's, Impact for 18-25's and students and CAMEO for seniors.
Destiny.
Destiny is the Christian Centre's youth group running on a Friday evening, and catering for anybody aged 13–18. Until 13 February 2010, they were based in the basement of a former car dealership, immediately across the road from the Christian Centre's main building. They now use the main hall due to health and safety concerns about the old venue. They have also released an EP of six songs that the members of the band have written themselves in December 2010.
Impact.
Impact is the students and 18-25s ministry at the Christian Centre. They run small groups for anyone in the age bracket, and hold larger events every term. They have held an annual weekend away every February since 2008, travelling to Cefn Lea in Wales since 2009.

Janab

Janab (جناب) is a rank title in Persian, which may be rendered as Excellency.
At the court of Persia's Shahanshahs of the imperial Qajar dynasty, precedence for non-members of the dynasty was organised in eight protocollary classes, generally coupled to various offices and qualities; the highest of these, styled Nawab, was usually reserved for princes, while the six classes were awarded to various ministers, officers, commanders, Muslim clergy and so on. Ranking only below Nawab and Shakhs-i-Awwal (usually present and former Prime Ministers), Janab was the style borne by senior Ministers of State, high ranking clergy, Grand Ministers of State, Governors-General of major provinces, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, etc.; it ranked above Amir or Khan, 'Ali Jah Muqarrab, 'Ali Jah, 'Ali Sha'an and 'Ali Qadir.
The compound style Janab-i-Ashraf (Ashraf being a provincial aristocrat) was borne by prime ministers and can be translated as His Serene Highness.

Darda, Croatia

Darda is a village and a municipality just north of Osijek, Croatia. It is located across the Drava river in Baranja. The population of the village is 5,394, with a total of 7,062 people in the municipality.
Name.
In Hungarian the town is known as "Dárda", in German as "Lanzenau", and in Serbian Cyrillic as Дарда. 
History.
It was first mentioned in the end of 13th and beginning of 14th century as "Tarda". During the Hungarian administration (13th-16th century), the area was part of the Baranya county. In the 16th-17th century, area was part of the Ottoman Empire and administratively belonged to the Sanjak of Mohaç. Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi in 1663 described Darda as an important market place with a strong fortress with towers. According to Çelebi, fortified part of the settlement had 50 houses and one mosque, while part of the settlement outside of the walls had one han and ten shops. 
Since the end of the 17th century, area was part of the Habsburg Monarchy and administratively belonged to the Baranya county, which was part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. Darda was administratively included into the municipality of Branjin Vrh and in 1850 offices of local administration of this municipality were moved to Darda. In the end of the 18th century, Darda was an multi-ethnic settlement, mainly populated by South Slavs and Germans. In 1910, population included Germans, South Slavs (Serbs, Croats) and Hungarians.
Since 1918, Darda part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922, it was part of the Novi Sad county, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Bačka Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, it was occupied by Hungary and was administratively included into Baranya county. It was returned to Yugoslav control in 1944 and was administratively part of Vojvodina until 1945, when it was transferred to the People's Republic of Croatia. 
During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995), Darda was incorporated, along with some other towns, into the unrecognized breakaway Republic of Serbian Krajina. It was returned to Croatian control after the war, following the short period of UN administration (1996–1998).
The small percentage of Romanians that live in Darda, or surrounding villages, call themselves Roma simply because mostly Croats and Serbs have called them Gipsies for the last 100 years and they accepted the fact that they are Roma when in reality they don't speak a word of Roma. They are in fact of Romanian ancestry and Romanian language is the one they use day-to-day.

Milecastle 53

Milecastle 53 (Banks Burn) was a milecastle on Hadrian's Wall ().
Description.
Milecastle 53 is situated west of the hamlet of Banks, Cumbria and northeast of Lanercost Priory. It lies 1520 metres west of Milecastle 52 and 1436 metres east of Milecastle 54. There is no trace of the milecastle visible.
The tall section of Hadrian's Wall at Hare Hill (standing to a height of about 2.7 metres) is just 80 metres west of Milecastle 53 ().
Excavations.
Milecastle 53 was excavated in 1932. It measured 21.9 metres east to west by 23.3 metres north to south. It had Type III gateways. 
The excavation found that most of the milecastle had been robbed of masonry and the original floor had been removed so that no internal buildings remained. Some remnants of the earlier Turf Wall milecastle remained in the northeast corner and south section.
Associated Turrets.
Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 53 are known as Turret 53A and Turret 53B.
Turret 53A.
Turret 53A (Hare Hill) () survives as a slight earthwork platform. The turret was found in 1854 or 1855, and excavated in 1932. The interior was found to be full of ashes.
Turret 53B.
Turret 53B (Craggle Hill) () also survives as a slight earthwork platform. It was excavated in 1932. The turret was the most easterly structure in Hadrian's Wall to use red sandstone.

Dinah Soar is a fictional superheroine in the Marvel Universe.
Fictional character biography.
Dinah Soar was born in the Savage Land. Her lineage is never revealed; it is unknown if she was actually a mutant or of alien descent.
Because she never spoke English, her background remains entirely unknown, but she became a founding member of the Great Lakes Avengers when Mr. Immortal first assembled the team. She is shown utilizing the ability to calm Mr. Immortal when he becomes overwhelmed with stress and rage. Because they found out that they are soulmates, the two soon became romantically involved as well.
Dinah Soar follows Mr. Immortal along in many, seemingly failed, exploits, until killed by Maelstrom in a battle. Her death plunges Mr. Immortal into a deep depression. Later, however, he manages to snap out of when he had the opportunity to pay back Deathurge, who had been taking away the souls of his loved ones away right before his eyes, in kind.
Powers and abilities.
As a result of extensive training, Dinah Soar used her wings for the ability of flight and good maneuverability. Razor tips on her wings are made for efficient weapons in battle, and she appeared to have sonic powers, using sound as an energy force, and the ability to calm Mr. Immortal via empathy after he returned to life. She also stated that her race is apparently ageless.
Name.
In keeping with the tongue-in-cheek, comic relief theme of the GLA/GLX/GLC/GLI, the name "Dinah Soar" is a reference to her depiction as a pterodactyl with a human female face.

Iñigo Díaz de Cerio Conejero (born 15 May 1984 in San Sebastián, Basque Country) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for CD Mirandés as a striker.
Football career.
Having finished his football grooming with Real Sociedad, Díaz de Cerio was the top scorer in the third division with the B-team in the 2005–06 season (all four groups), and also made his La Liga debut on 12 February 2006 in a 0–1 away loss against Atlético Madrid. In the 2007–08 campaign he scored 16 second level goals as Real Sociedad finished fourth, falling short of a return to the top flight.
On 8 November 2008 Díaz de Cerio suffered a serious injury after a collision with SD Eibar player Zigor, fracturing the tibia and the fibula of his right leg. After a successful surgery, the club medical's staff nonetheless stated that the recovery would be "...very slow...", and the player was expected to miss the vast majority of the season.
In late June 2009, Díaz de Cerio switched to Basque neighbours Athletic Bilbao on a four-year deal, after his Real link had just expired. He returned to action almost one year after his injury (5 November 2009), playing 30 minutes in a 1–1 draw at C.D. Nacional for the campaign's UEFA Europa League.
On 13 August 2010, Córdoba CF confirmed Díaz de Cerio's loan for one year. In the following transfer window, however, he was recalled by Athletic Bilbao.

Notosuchus

Notosuchus (; 'southern crocodile') is an extinct genus of South American notosuchian crocodylomorph. It was terrestrial, living approximately 85 million years ago in the Coniacian or Santonian stages of the Late Cretaceous. 
"Notosuchus" was relatively small, reaching 1.5 m (5 ft) in length and a weight of 36 kg. Remains have been found in the Bajo de la Carpa Formation in Patagonia, Argentina. First named in 1896, "Notosuchus" was the first known notosuchian. The type species is "N. terrestris". A second species, "N. lepidus", was named in 1957.
A paper published in 2008 by Fiorelli and Calvo described new remains of the type species "N. terrestris". In it, the authors suggested that the skull would have supported a short trunk, or "hog's snout" as well as fleshy upper and lower lips. The anteriorly directed nares and the absence of a bony nasal septum (which presumably indicates cartilaginous tissue serving its place) provide evidence for a trunk-like snout, while striations on the surface of the nasal bones and the lower jaw most likely acted as attachment points for the nasolabial muscles and the depressor muscle, respectively. Additionally, the authors suggested that a lateral rim on the dentary as well as numerous aligned neurovascular foramina are evidence of soft cheek-like muscular tissue. The function of the trunk was likely used for searching for food by sniffing the ground in a manner similar to extant suids and peccaries, while the cheeks would aid in mastication by preventing food loss.

Haasil Ghaat

Hasil Ghaat () is a novel by Bano Qudsia. There is some controversy as to whether this book be classified as a novel.
It is mainly a collection of thoughts of an old Pakistani man Humayun Farid who is visiting his emigrant daughter Arjmand in USA. Most of the thoughts occur to him as he is sitting in the balcony of her daughter’s home. The narrative may well be thought to be employing the stream of consciousness technique.

Pilsley, North East Derbyshire

Pilsley is a rural village in Northeast Derbyshire, near Chesterfield. Pilsley consists of two distinct residential areas known as Lower Pilsley and Pilsley (sometimes Upper Pilsley). Lower Pilsley being the northern residential area and Pilsley being the southern residential area. There is some local disagreement as to whether these two areas constitute two separate villages or one larger village. Both areas of the village are united by the same parish council, Pilsley Parish Council, which was formed on 30 January 1874; Pilsley having previously been part of the parish of North Wingfield. Maps show that the village is made up of four separate residential areas, which are, in order of their north to south alignment, Lower Pilsley, Upper Pilsley, Pilsley and Nether Pilsley.
Pilsley has an Anglican church, St. Mary's, an evangelical Methodist church, two primary schools, a post office and a Kingdom Hall building for Jehovah's Witnesses. Pilsley also has a Village Hall and St Mary's Centre (formerly the church hall). Recently a new sports centre (The Elm Centre) was built for the school which is also available for community use. A section of the East Midland Mainline railway line (Nottingham to Chesterfield section) runs along the western edge of the village. A branch of the Great Central Railway ran through the village prior to the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, with a station sited on Station Road. The route of this former railway line now serves as a popular walking, cycling and horse riding trail known as the Five Pits Trail, linking Pilsley to Tibshelf, Holmewood, Grassmoor and beyond.
Pilsley has a Sunday league football team called Pilsley Miners Welfare Football Club. The team is currently part of the Chesterfield and District Sunday League.
The source of the River Rother is at Pilsley.
History.
Pilsley is mentioned in the Domesday Book as one of the manors belonging to Walter D'Aincourt.
Prior to 1800, Pilsley was an agricultural settlement and consisted of Upper Pilsley and Nether Pilsley. Few of the houses from that period still exist, these being some of on the corner of Station Road and Sitwell Grange Lane near the Primary School; others around Barlow Bank, Barlow Bank Farm and Grange Farm in Upper Pilsley near the site of the village well.
These houses are made from locally quarried coal-measure sandstone which is soft and contains a high percentage of iron. This quarry no longer exists, but was north of Upper Pilsley.
Pilsley Colliery was founded in 1866 on the site of the present day Locko Plantation. At its peak the colliery comprised six shafts, employed 945 men and produced 1,200 tons of coal per shift. The colliery was closed in 1957.

Gather Yourselves Together

Gather Yourselves Together is an early novel by the science fiction author Philip K. Dick, written around 1948-1950, and published posthumously by WCS Books in 1994. As with many of his early books which were considered unsuitable for publication when they were first submitted as manuscripts, this was not science fiction, but rather a work of straight literary fiction. The manuscript was 481 pages in length. At the time it was published, it was one of only two Dick novels for which the manuscript was known to exist which remained unpublished. The other, "Voices from the Street", was published in 2007. 
Dwight Brown wrote the afterword. As of 2011, the original hardcover edition was out of print; in July 2012, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt released a trade paperback edition of "Gather Yourselves Together", complete with Brown's afterword.
Plot summary.
After the final victory of Mao Zedong's Chinese Communists in 1949, an American company prepares to abandon their Chinese operations, leaving three people behind to oversee transitional affairs- Carl Fitter, Verne Tildon and Barbara Mahler. Verne and Barbara were previously involved with each other back in the United States, in 1945, when she lost her virginity to him. They have sex again, but Barbara has matured, and becomes more interested in Carl, who is younger than she is. Carl is more interested in reading his handwritten volume of personal philosophy to her, but Barbara does succeed in seducing him, shortly before the arrival of the Chinese.
Aspects of "Gather Yourselves Together".
Despite being an early, non-science fiction work, the book prefigures several staples of Dick's writing.

Sam Raybould

Samuel Francis "Sam" Raybould (11 June 1875 – 1949) was an English professional football player. He played as a striker and is most renowned for his days playing for Liverpool.
Life and playing career.
Raybould was born in Staveley, Derbyshire and played for Poolsbrook United, Staveley Colliery and North Staveley before joining Chesterfield Town on trial. His trial wasn't successful and he moved to Ilkeston Town from where he joined Derby County in 1904. 
Despite scoring twice in five games for Derby, Raybould returned to non-league football with Ilkeston Town, subsequently playing for Poolsbrook United, Ileston Town (for a third spell) and Bolsover Colliery before joining New Brighton Tower in 1899.
He scored ten times in just 13 league games for New Brighton and was signed by manager Tom Watson for Liverpool in January 1900. He made his debut on 13 January 1900 in a 2-0 win over W.B.A at Anfield and scored his first goal for the club a week later on 20 January in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park a game which saw Everton win 3-1. 
Originally an outside-right, he switched to centre-forward at Liverpool, and became a highly successful goalscorer. In the 1902-03 season Raybould set a new record of 31 league goals in a single league season. This record stood until 1931 when Gordon Hodgson broke it by scoring 36 goals. In 1903 he, along with right-back Archie Glover was given a seven-month ban from football for agreeing to 'financial inducements' to sign for Southern League Portsmouth. They were also given a lifetime ban on ever signing for Portsmouth.
Raybould regained his place in the Liverpool side and went on to score 130 goals in 226 appearances for Liverpool and remained their record goalscorer for 37 years. As of 2006, he stands as the tenth-highest goalscorer in Liverpool's history. 
After leaving Liverpool in 1907, Raybould moved first to Sunderland and after a season there, he finished his career with Woolwich Arsenal. He made his Arsenal debut against Everton on 2 September 1908 and played 30 times for Arsenal that season, scoring seven goals. 
He left league football in 1909, joining non-league Chesterfield and subsequently playing for Sutton Town and Barlborough United.
Raybould never gained international recognition but was selected 3 times to represent the Football League against the Scottish League.

Burmantofts Pottery

Burmantofts Pottery was the common trading name of a manufacturer of ceramic pipes and construction materials, named after the Burmantofts district of Leeds, England, United Kingdom.
The business began in 1859 when fire clay was discovered in a coal mine owned by William Wilcox and John Lassey. In 1863 Lassey's share was bought by John Holroyd and the company then named Wilcox & Co.
In 1879, after a period of expansion, the firm made decorative bricks and tiles in orange or buff-coloured architectural terracotta, glazed bricks, and glazed terracotta (faience) . Architect Alfred Waterhouse used their materials in his Yorkshire College (1883) in Leeds.
In 1885 products were on sale in London, Paris and Montreal. By 1889 they had commissioned Maurice Bingham Adams to design stock items for their catalogue. Also in 1889 Wilcox & Co merged with other companies to found "The Leeds Fireclay Co. Ltd." — the largest in the country.
Terracotta production ceased in 1904 but the firm created an artificial marble called "Marmo" in 1908, as used on Atlas House, King Street, Leeds and Michelin House, London.
The firm closed in 1957, at which time it comprised ninety kilns on of land.

Tofaş Şahin

The Tofaş Şahin, Doğan, and Kartal are Turkish versions of the old Fiat 131 automobile made in Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi A.S. facilities in Bursa, Turkey. While "şahin" means "hawk" in Turkish, "kartal" means "eagle" and "doğan" means "falcon". The car was built from 1977 and sold in Turkey until 2002, with Egyptian assembly coming to an end in 2009 and in Ethiopia until 2010.
History.
In February 1977 the Turkish Tofaş Murat 131 was first introduced, as a near exact replica of the Fiat 131. Originally it was only available with a Solex twin-barrel carbureted 1.3 L pushrod petrol four, producing (SAE) at 5,250 rpm. From 1981 the Şahin ("Falcon") and Kartal names were also in use, with the Kartal ("Eagle") being the station wagon. From this point a 1.6-litre OHV engine was also added to the lineup, producing DIN at 5,400 rpm. This largely replaced the smaller 1.3 (now with a claimed DIN at 5,400 rpm with a Weber twin carburetor), which was only retained as a lower priced option for the more basic Şahin version. The single, rounded rectangular headlights of the earlier Murat 131s were replaced with double units. Announced in September 1981 (on sale by October), the new luxurious Doğan model received a five-speed manual transmission. The Doğan also received a fully fabric upholstered interior, a heated rear window, and had the front door vent windows removed. The luggage compartment was fully carpeted and the suspension was adjusted to minimize understeer at high speeds.
The five-speed remained standard only for the Doğan, although it later became an option in the lesser models. From 1984, the Doğan was also set apart by large rectangular headlights while the lesser Şahin and Kartal made do with round twin headlights.
1988 facelift.
In 1988 they received a major aesthetic revision resulting in a design very reminiscent of the Fiat Regata. The "Murat" portion of the name was still used in some marketing material, but no longer appeared on the car and gradually vanished. The new headlights were large and square, with triangular corner lights which wrap around. The grille has a number of slim vertical crossbars in black plastic, with higher end models receiving some body colored elements at the top of the grille. After the facelift, the Doğan and Şahin sedan models are almost visually identical barring various upper-class trim options on the slightly more luxurious Doğan variant. The Kartal, the station wagon derivation of the design, has a rear body developed locally, with a higher roof than that of the 131 Estate originating with SEAT in Spain.
In August 1994 (for the 1995 model year), the range received a facelift with a new grille (body colored for all but the lowest specced versions). The grille had a prominent frame, with the opening containing a stylized "T" and a slim crossbar. The Doğan SLX also received power steering. For 1996 the cars were provided with new SOHC engines from the Fiat Tempra (an engine that was first designed for the Fiat 128) in two versions: a 1.4 L with at 5,500 rpm (only for the Şahin), and a 1.6 L with at 5,800 rpm which was available in all models. The Şahin no longer received the 1.4 in Turkey after a while, instead being fitted with an version of the 1.6. Later the grille received a circular central motif, containing the "T" logo.
In 1998 the "Kartal Kargo" was introduced. This was a two-seater panel van version of the wagon, akin to Fiat's own Marengo line. The Kartal Kargo can manage a payload. The rear windows were plated and most trim details were in black plastic, but the Kargo did receive standard power steering.
In 2002 the range received another minor facelift, but this year also heralded the end of Turkish sales as they were now only produced for export, usually in CKD form. Power outputs of catalyzed engines also decreased to at 6,000 rpm and at 5,750 rpm respectively. By this time the four-speed transmission was no longer available. In 2005 they were introduced with single point electronic fuel injection. Turkish production was gradually shifted to Egypt. In 2006 assembly was also commenced by DOCC in Ethiopia where it continued on a small scale until 2010 (see more below).
Decline.
The Şahin, Doğan, and Kartal all shared the same rear wheel drive platform with longitudinal engine placement, McPherson design suspension system for the front wheels and a live axle for the rear. Their major selling point was their low price, robust design, and its low-maintenance cost, largely due to its near universal popularity during the 1980s and 1990s. However, this design resulted in a very cramped passenger compartment as the gearbox, fuel tank and shaft tunnel occupied a lot of space. Due to its roots as a mid 1970s Italian passenger vehicle, the design lacked various safety equipment standards including ABS, passenger airbags, and traction control. Its popularity in Turkey started waning in the mid-1990s as modern imported cars flooded the market. More recently, most Tofas have been converted to use LPG fuel as gasoline prices soared and made the cars financially unfeasible in its unmodified state. It was the de facto taxi of Turkey before it was deemed unsuitable for taxi use due to Turkey's ongoing negotiations to enter the EU, and the ensuing regulations implemented. The models have been replaced by the Fiat Siena (later the Fiat Albea/Fiat Palio) series.
Nasr variant.
Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi A.S. produced the Şahin and its siblings under license in Egypt in large quantities from 1991, with assembly carried out by the state-owned Nasr car company. The range underwent the same changes as did Turkish market models, although the Kartal was taken out of production in 2003 and the Doğan was eventually replaced by the Şahin 1600 SL - with the 1400 S beneath it in the lineup. Production was gradually shifted to Egypt, with local parts content reaching 45% by 2006. With the winding down of the Nasr company in 2009, Egyptian production ended.
DOCC.
In 2006 the Tofaş Şahin was put into production in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, by the Holland Car Company, a joint venture between a firm from the Netherlands called Trento Engineering and the local firm of Ethio-Holland. Their version of the Şahin is called the DOCC, which comes from the term Dutch Overseas Car Company and comes with the OHC 1.6 L (1,581 cc) powerplant. After the end at El Nasr, Ethiopian production came to a halt in 2010.

Pittsburgh Rens

The Pittsburgh Rens were an American basketball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that was a member of the American Basketball League. The founder of the ABL, Abe Saperstein, was the owner of the Harlem Globetrotters who had competed for many decades against the New York Rens and eventually bought the rights to the Rens' name. Because of the Pittsburgh Renaissance urban renewal project, it was convenient to coin the "Rens" as an instantly-recognizable name for this new version of a basketball team.
The team existed from 1961 until 1963. The Rens were owned by Lenny Litman, a prominent Pittsburgh businessman.
All of the team's home games were played in the Pittsburgh Civic Arena.

UK Online

UK Online was a consumer Internet service provider that operated within the UK, and began as a dial-up provider in 1994. Network provider Easynet acquired the company in 1996, and were in turn acquired by BSkyB in 2005. The service was closed down in January 2011.
Initially launching an ADSL based broadband product in November 2004 with a 1MB service, they did not appear to be offering anything out of the ordinary. However, they quickly followed up by launching one of the UK's first consumer 8MB services in the same month. At the initial price of £39.99 a month, the service caused quite a stir in the UK broadband market. The 8MB service was only available in areas served by the parent company Easynet's LLU operations. Areas not covered were offered traditional speed products based on BT wholesale products. Along with planned speed upgrades by cable supplier Telewest, the "UK Online" 8MB service helped spur a series of investments by other ISPs in the UK in an effort to keep up.
In October 2007 "UK Online" provided three packages, "Lite", "Pro", and "Premier" - all with ""unlimited"" usage limits. However, a Fair Usage Policy applied to all packages and heavy users were moved onto so called "bad boy pipes" (although this did not appear to happen with LLU connections).
Since the regulatory approval of ADSL2+ technology in the UK, "UK Online" were able to offer services with speeds up to 22MB, and were one of the first companies to do so on a national scale. This was still based on the "Easynet" LLU coverage however.
In October 2005 BSkyB purchased "Easynet" and so now also owned "UK Online", however "UK Online" continued to exist as a separate entity from Sky Broadband. In January 2008 Easynet Connect was launched as a SME ISP by UK Online and Easynet.
In spring 2008 "UK Online" announced it would shortly be launching a number of competitive new services, including domain registration, Microsoft Hosted Exchange email and commercial web hosting on Windows and Linux. The development of the planned services was cancelled and all mention of them, including the pre-registration page, quietly dropped from the website in May/June 2008.
In September 2009 the online ordering system started displaying a message of "We are unable to confirm some information about your current connection and cannot process your signup online at this time. You can still sign up for UK Online by calling us directly on 0800 053 2222". However, on ringing up, customers were told the ordering systems were being updated, and orders could not be placed.
In November 2010, UK Online announced on its home page that Sky was closing it down, with all UK Online services due to end on 21 January 2011.
By February 2011, the UK Online website stated simply "UK Online is now closed". However, there were problems with the company closure and a number of customers reported that their phone lines still had ADSL activated on them with the consequence that they could not migrate to another ISP despite the fact that they no longer received any service from either UK Online or Sky.

Christian Clemenson

Christian Clemenson (born March 17, 1958) is an American film and television actor. He is well known for his portrayal of Jerry "Hands" Espenson in the television series "Boston Legal", for which he won the 2006 Emmy Award for Best Guest Actor in a Drama Series. He appeared in a tense scene with Holly Hunter in the 1987 film, Broadcast News as a newsroom editor, "Bobby, Bobby, Bobby..."
Early life.
Clemenson was born and raised in Humboldt, Iowa, the son of drug store owners Ernest and Ruth Clemenson. In his early teens he delivered the Des Moines Register, which had a long tradition of awarding scholarships to top east-coast preparatory schools to a select few "paper boys". Clemenson, a straight-A junior high school student, won a Register scholarship to Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. In 1973, while Chris was enrolled at Phillips Academy, his father died at age 58. He participated in many theatrical productions at Phillips Academy. 
Upon graduation from Phillips in 1976, he entered Harvard College. From his freshman year onward he received important roles in campus stage productions, often receiving more praise from critics than the productions received. When Clemenson starred in a Harvard Lampoon sketch comedy show, a Harvard Crimson theatre critic panned the show but described Clemenson as "hugely talented actor who can trigger hysteria with any of a dozen subtle expressions or inflections." Other Crimson critics described his performances in Shakespeare plays as "a tour de force of sheer talent and intelligence" (in "The Winter's Tale") and "a very fine and subtle performance" (in "Measure for Measure"). He displayed early on his remarkable range when he undertook with inimitable flair and hilarious effect the hugely solemn role of Erde "the green-faced torso", goddess of the Earth, in Peter Sellers's Loeb Drama Center production of "Wagner's Ring" (1979).
During many summers he would return to Humboldt to star in, and later direct, local community theatre plays at Humboldt's Castle Theatre.
After graduating from Harvard College in 1980 and the Yale School of Drama in 1984, he moved to Los Angeles.
Clemenson and fellow Boston Legal star James Spader are old friends from Phillips Academy days.
Career.
Many of Clemenson's early roles in television and film matched his personality as a bright, soft-spoken professional. He was a law student in the television version of "The Paper Chase", Alex Keaton's English teacher in the television show "Family Ties", the bailiff in the Ivan Reitman movie "Legal Eagles", the flight surgeon in the movie "Apollo 13", a cop in "The Big Lebowski", a killer in "The Fisher King" and Dr. Dale Lawrence in the movie "And the Band Played On". While he has been a familiar face for over a decade, until recently his name was not so well known.
In 1999, Clemenson appeared in the "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" episode "Bad Girls" as a morbidly obese demon named Balthazar. He wore a large padded suit and extensive make-up for the role, and the character's repulsive, villainous nature contradicted many of his earlier roles.
Recently, Clemenson has become known for his role as Jerry "Hands" Espenson on the television series "Boston Legal". For playing Espenson, he won an Emmy Award for Best Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2006 and was nominated for the same award in 2007. He remained with the series through to its finale in 2008.
In film, he starred as real-life 9/11 victim Tom Burnett in "United 93". On television, he was a regular on "The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr." playing the part of Socrates Poole. He also had a recurring role on "Veronica Mars". Clemenson also has appeared in a season 6 episode of "NCIS", "Dead Reckoning". He also appeared in two season 2 episodes of "The Mentalist". He also played Jimmy Masterson on the 3rd episode of "Memphis Beat", "Love Me Tender."
In 2009, Clemenson joined "" as the new medical examiner, Dr. Tom Loman. He appeared throughout the show's eighth, ninth and tenth seasons as a recurring character. 2013, also he appeared as guest star in Harry's Law.

Zinny J. Zan

Zinny J. Zan (born Bo Stagman in January 18, 1964 and earlier known as Bosse Belsen) is a Swedish rock/glam metal singer who is the former lead-singer for Shotgun Messiah and is currently the founder and frontman for Zan Clan and reunited Easy Action.
Musical career.
Zinny J. Zan is probably best known internationally as the original lead singer for the 1980s glam metal band Shotgun Messiah (1985–90). However, he was already well-known in his native Sweden by the time he was 18, when his band Easy Action (1981–85) toured Scandinavia and soon thereafter signed a contract with Warner Bros. Records. Easy Action was the first Swedish music artist ever to sign a worldwide deal.
Zinny's work with Easy Action included one album as well as a Swedish slasher movie titled "Blood Tracks", for which Easy Action both provided the music and starred in.
After a few years of enjoying local success touring the Scandinavia region, Zinny wanted the band to try to make a go of it in the U.S., while the other members of the band were hesitant to leave their home country. These conflicting views eventually prompted Zinny to leave Sweden for New York and start looking for a new band.
He was soon contacted by fellow Swedes Tim Sköld and Harry Cody and asked to join Kingpin (the band that would eventually become Shotgun Messiah). While still performing under the name Kingpin, the band recorded the album "Welcome to Bop City". After being signed to Relativity Records and relocating to Hollywood, California, they changed their name to Shotgun Messiah and remixed and released the "Bop City" album as Shotgun Messiah's self-titled debut album.
The album "Shotgun Messiah" was a moderate success, spawning three fairly popular singles as well as two music videos for MTV and reaching #52 on the American Billboard chart. Eventually though, personality and creative differences between Harry, Tim and Zinny began to grow and led to Zinny's departure from Shotgun Messiah in 1990.
After the split, Zinny went back to Stockholm to recalibrate, but due to various personal problems (a divorce, the death of his father, his sister's cancer diagnosis, and his own battle with a stomach disease), it would be over four years before the eventual 1994 release of the album "Citizen of Wasteland", credited to his new band Zan Clan. The album saw rather limited success.
In 2002, Zinny would record and release the solo album "City Boy Blues" which enjoyed moderate commercial and critical success in Scandinavia and earned distinction as the "Comeback Album of the Year" in the UK´s "Classic Rock Magazine" but failed to garner much attention in the U.S.
Zinny then signed a TV contract to be the Tour Manager and Mentor for a band called Tribal Ink for the TV show "Wannabe" in 2002.
Shortly thereafter, Zinny would resurrect the Zan Clan with a new line up including producer/guitarist/songwriter friend Chris Laney. In 2005, the Zan Clan released the album "We Are Zan Clan, Who The Fuck Are You" in addition to opening a series of shows in Europe for Whitesnake and Queensrÿche.
Easy Action reunion.
In 2006, Zinny reunited with his former Easy Action bandmate, guitarist Kee Marcello (who had served a stint in the band Europe in the interim) for a Reunion gig at Sweden Rock Festival. This performance led to more shows for Easy Action, including serving as the opening act for Twisted Sister on their farewell tour in 2007.
In 2008, Easy Action released a new single "Jack's Back" (Produced by Chris Laney) and opened up The Speedway Grand Prix at Ullevi in Gothenburg. This tune remained on the singles chart in Sweden for weeks.
At one point later in the 2000s, it was reported that Zinny and Easy Action were finishing up the recording of their new album, which had the working title of "Looking Up Your Old Address". However, in 2013, it was revealed that the "Looking Up Your Old Address" album would not be released, as Easy Action had split up once again, with Kee and Zinny parting ways.
Influences and Tributes.
Zinny was heavily influenced by such bands as Aerosmith, Kiss, Sex Pistols, and Thin Lizzy, inspirations which are reflected in his songwriting and singing style.
In addition to his work with numerous bands, he has also performed on several tribute albums. He contributed to the FastLane Records release "Tricked Out", a tribute to Cheap Trick, where he performed the CT hit "Surrender." He later also contributed a cover version of the Thin Lizzy song "Dedication" to the "A Tribute to Phil Lynott" album.
Currently.
Zinny is reportedly writing an autobiography called "The Lies and Faults of Zinny J. Zan" which will reveal everything, from groupies to "behind-the-scenes" content within his bands and the record industry.
On April 19, 2013, Zinny released the single "The Perfect Age of Rock n Roll," which also appears on the soundtrack for the American movie of the same name starring Peter Fonda. He is also reportedly working on a new solo album together with former Easy Action 2006 members Simon Roxx and Bjorn Höglund.
Personal life.
Zinny is a father of two children: a daughter Yasmine and a son Zack (born 2009), the latter of whose mother is Zinny's fiancée for the last 14 years, Beatrice.
Previous bands.
Belsen Boys, Brilliant Boys, Alarm X, Bangshot, Dream Police, Grand Slam

Mighty Man (CrossGen)

Mighty Man is a character from CrossGen Entertainment's Sigilverse. He appeared in a single issue, Negation War #1. He was shown as a caped superhero of the Superman archetype.
Fictional character biography.
Mighty Man was a previously unknown Sigil-Bearer that first appeared in Negation War #1. Mighty Man's planet was the first of many to be invaded by Charon and the Negation. His watcher/mentor dispatched by Danik, took the form of a young male child. He was not prepared for Charon's appearance. Mighty Man was killed by Evinlea shortly after the Negation arrived on his planet. His watcher/mentor discovered by Charon eventually sacrificed himself to destroy the planet they were on, the orbiting Negation fleet but mostly to try to kill Evinlea of the First (whom it is supposed, would pose a significant threat to Danik's forces (the First) in this universe).
Sigil-Bearer.
Mighty Man was not a major character of the Sigilverse but his appearance did coincide with what is generally known about the Sigil-Bearers, that there are many of them and that each's powers are unique. Mighty Man did not display high-level powers. He also did not display a common trait normally associated with Sigil-Bearers, the siphoning of a First's energy (as with Evinlea, although there is much that can account for this).
Mighty Man's real name is Taylor (as uttered by his watcher/mentor). He has a wife Carrol and a son Tommy. They lived together in Tri City on an unnamed planet.

Marsh's Library

Marsh's Library, situated in St. Patrick's Close, adjacent to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, Ireland is a well-preserved library of the late Renaissance and early Enlightenment. When it opened to the public in 1707 it was the first public library in Ireland. It was built to the order of Archbishop Narcissus Marsh and has a collection of over 25,000 books and 300 manuscripts.
History.
Foundation.
The library was built for Narcissus Marsh, Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, and formerly Provost of Trinity College, Dublin. It was long claimed that the Library opened in 1701, but this is untrue. The Cathedral agreed in 1701 to provide a plot of land for a library, but building work only commenced in 1703. The First Gallery and the Old Reading Room seem to have been completed by 1705. The Library was formally established by Act of Parliament in 1707, and the Second Gallery was added during the course of 1708 or 1709. 
The design was by the then Surveyor General of Ireland, Sir William Robinson, also the architect of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. Marsh donated his own library, which included the former library of Bishop Edward Stillingfleet, of over 10,000 volumes, regarded as one of the finest in England, which he had bought for 2,500 pounds.
Dr. Elias Bouhereau, a Huguenot refugee from La Rochelle who fled from France in 1695, was the first librarian or Keeper, and also donated his personal library.
The Library was formally incorporated in 1707 by Parliament, which vested the house and books in a body known as the "Governors and Guardians of the Library", comprising religious and state dignitaries and officials, and their successors still oversee it. Narcissus Marsh died in 1713, and is buried just beyond the library, in the grounds of the cathedral.
In 1745, John Stearne, Bishop of Clogher, bequeathed half of his collection of books to the library. The other half of Stearne's book collection (and all of his manuscripts) were given to Trinity College, Dublin. 
Recent history.
In 1989, Muriel McCarthy became the first female Keeper, holding the position until her retirement in 2011. The current Keeper is Dr Jason McElligott, who was educated at University College Dublin and St John's College, Cambridge.
The catalogue of the library is online at www.marshlibrary.ie/catalogue. Scholars and students can read the books and manuscripts by appointment. Tourists come from across the world to see the old library, and in 2013 there were a total of 16,000 tourist visitors. The projected figure for 2014 is 18,000 visitors. 
Holdings.
The library contains over 25,000 books from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, in addition to around 300 manuscripts, and around 80 books (incunabula) from before 1501. Subjects covered include medicine, law, science, travel, navigation, mathematics, music, surveying and classical literature, and especially theology. 
The Marsh collection includes works in oriental languages, and in Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish and Russian, as well as an important collection of Latin Judaica. The Bouhéreau collection relates especially to France, and French religious controversies, and also medicine.
Among the manuscripts is a volume of the Lives of the Irish Saints in Latin from ca. 1400, as well as 16th century madrigals and other musical pieces, and manuscripts on theological, legal and medical matters.
Interior design.
The library still features its original fittings, including seating and shelving. The bookcases are made of quater-plained Irish oak with carved and lettered gables. There are three wire alcoves, known as 'cages', which were constructed in the 1770s in response to thefts in the library.
Today.
The library is one of the last 18th century buildings in Ireland still used for its original purpose. It is open to visitors for a fee of €3.00, or €2.00 for students and senior citizens. Opening hours are 9:30-5pm Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and 10-5 Saurday. Guided tours take place at 3pm. 
Researchers are admitted free of charge, as long as they have made prior applications.
The Library holds exhibitions, and occasional conferences, and has published a range of material, primarily related to exhibitions and the catalogue.
As a charitable institution the library accepts donations, which are recorded in a special ledger which dates back to 1707.
The Library has an active social media presence, and every day posts at least one image from the collections on Facebook and Twiiter. These images give a sense of the breadth and depth of the Library holdings.

Cernusco sul Naviglio is a town and "comune" in the province of Milan, Lombardy, Italy.
History.
Until the 19th century the town was known as "Cernusco Asinario", from the tomb of the Roman functionary "Caius Asinius" (died 45 BC) found in its territory. During the Lombard domination the area was a possession of the bishops of Monza; later it was acquired by the "Pieve" of Gorgonzola. In the 13th century it became a fief of the Torriani and, after the former's defeat, of the Visconti. It received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on March 18, 1985.

Stringer Bell

Russell "Stringer" Bell is a fictional character on the HBO drama "The Wire", played by English actor Idris Elba. Bell served as drug kingpin Avon Barksdale's second-in-command, assuming direct control of the Barksdale Organization during Avon's imprisonment. Bell attends economics classes at Baltimore City Community College and maintains a personal library, including a copy of Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations". He attempts to legitimize the Barksdale Organization and insulate himself from direct criminality through money laundering and investments in housing development, aided through his buying of influence from politicians. 
Biography.
Stringer was born September 17, 1969, and grew up in the West Baltimore projects alongside childhood friends Avon Barksdale and Wee-Bey Brice.
Season one.
Stringer is first seen attending the trial of Avon's nephew and lieutenant, D'Angelo Barksdale, for the murder of rival drug dealer "Pooh" Blanchard. Avon has tasked Stringer with ensuring that D'Angelo is acquitted. To this end, Stringer has enforcers Roland "Wee-Bey" Brice, Anton "Stinkum" Artis, and Savino intimidate and bribe witnesses over the course of the trial. When D'Angelo is released, Avon has Stringer demote him to running the operation in the low-rise projects known as "the pit."
Stringer then has his hands full dealing with Omar Little's crew, after they steal some of Barksdale's stash from the pit. Stringer visits D'Angelo to instruct him about checking his organization for an informant who may have been giving Omar information. Avon orders contract killings on Omar and all of his crew. Avon also has Stringer assist Stinkum in taking over new territory for the organization.
Stringer takes Stinkum to survey his new territory, with some additional muscle in the form of Wee-Bey and Marquis "Bird" Hilton. While there, Stringer receives word from D'Angelo that two of his crew, Wallace and Poot, have spotted Omar's boyfriend Brandon at an arcade. Stringer drives to meet the young drug dealers at the arcade, bringing the three enforcers. He has them abduct Brandon using handcuffs and posing as police officers. They torture Brandon to death trying to discover Omar's whereabouts. Then, following Avon's orders, they mutilate his corpse and display it in the low rises. Omar responds to the brutal slaying by striking back at Stinkum and Wee-Bey as they move into the new territory, killing Stinkum and wounding Wee-Bey.
With this escalation of the conflict, Stringer tries to persuade Avon to offer Omar a truce. His plan is to let Omar grow complacent, then kill him when he lets his guard down. Avon initially brushes this suggestion aside, but after Omar nearly kills him, he accepts Stringer's advice. Stringer also persuades Avon to give up his pager—making Stringer a buffer between Avon and the rest of the operation.
As Avon grows increasingly suspicious that the police are watching him, Stringer takes precautions to smoke out informants and to counter wiretaps. He instructs D'Angelo to withhold pay from his subordinates for several weeks on the grounds that those who don't soon ask for money are likely to be the ones being paid as informants. However, this plan reveals no informants. To foil wiretaps, Stringer insists on phone discipline, telling D'Angelo's crew to remove nearby payphones and walk longer distances to other phones instead. 
When it's time for Avon to clean house, Stringer orders the murder of Wallace, who had been a key witness in the killing of Omar's boyfriend. Stringer tries to find out about Wallace's whereabouts from D'Angelo, but D'Angelo realizes his friend is in danger and only tells Stringer that Wallace left the business. Stringer turns to Bodie Broadus, D'Angelo's second in the pit operation and learns that Wallace has returned to working for D'Angelo. Stringer asks Bodie to murder Wallace. He also has the witness he bribed in D'Angelo's trial, Nakeesha Lyles, killed. 
Stringer assumes command of the Barksdale crew when Avon is arrested at the end of season one. D'Angelo is also arrested and when he learns of the murder of his friend Wallace he blames Stringer, driving a wedge between the two. Stringer rewards Bodie's loyalty by promoting him to run their operation at the 221 tower.
Season two.
In season two, Stringer faces a serious problem when the Barksdales' usual supplier, a Dominican named Roberto, becomes the focus of a DEA investigation. The New York-based Dominican syndicate ends its partnership with the Barksdales, suspecting Avon of informing on them in exchange for a lighter prison sentence. Avon finds alternatives through Philadelphia and Atlanta connections, but the heroin they supply is far less potent and more expensive. At the same time, rival supplier Proposition Joe introduces a purer, more effective heroin line through his connection with the Greeks—leading many drug users to migrate to his territory. With the Barksdales' operation mortally threatened, Stringer grows desperate.
Stringer becomes concerned with D'Angelo's increasingly hostile attitude towards his uncle, fearful that he may turn against the Barksdales. He secretly becomes involved with D'Angelo's ex-girlfriend, Donette, using the relationship to keep an eye on him. When D'Angelo cuts himself off from the rest of his family, Stringer secretly arranges to have him killed through a connection in Washington. Stringer's connection has his cousin, who is in the same prison, strangle D'Angelo and stage the death as a suicide. Stringer stresses the need to keep Avon from knowing about his role in D'Angelo's murder. 
Avon's trust in Stringer becomes strained when Stringer secretly agrees to share Barksdale territory with Proposition Joe in exchange for Joe's higher-quality heroin—an idea Avon vehemently opposes. When Avon hires legendary New York enforcer Brother Mouzone to chase Joe's dealers out of the Barksdale towers, Stringer maneuvers carefully to preserve his alliance with Joe behind Avon's back. He manages to do so by tricking Omar into shooting Mouzone by blaming him for Brandon's death. After Mouzone returns to New York, Avon grudgingly agrees to Stringer's proposal. However, the two are no longer as close as they had been before.
Season three.
Stringer uses more businesslike strategies as he continues running the Barksdale empire. He obtains legitimate business fronts for the Barksdale organization, forms a retail co-op with Proposition Joe and other rival dealers, and runs meetings with his underlings according to Robert's Rules of Order. Stringer is also shown to have made several donations to consultants and politicians, including the corrupt state senator Clay Davis, to facilitate development of a condominium complex.
At the beginning of Season 3, Stringer has reached the apex of his power. Along with Proposition Joe, he effectively runs the drug trade in the entire city. Joe and Stringer realize that murders, not drug deals, are what bring on serious police investigations, and consequently strive to minimize violence among their crews and the other Co-op dealers, such as Hungry Man and Fat Face Rick. 
The resulting lack of murders forces Daniels' Major Crimes Unit to turn its attention elsewhere, namely to a more reckless Jamaican dealer named Kintell Williamson (AKA Prince K). Most of the unit understands the decision, but McNulty angrily objects, claiming that Stringer is clearly a more prolific trafficker than their new target. This brings McNulty into conflict with Freamon and Daniels, with Greggs caught in the middle and Prez and Sydnor disenchanted with the less interesting Williamson. As a result, the Major Case Unit, previously the most effective unit in Baltimore's CID, is temporarily compromised and Stringer is able to run free for a time. 
When Avon is released from prison, he is uninterested in Stringer's efforts to reform the Barksdale organization. While Stringer wants to invest the organization's profits in legitimate business investments, Avon is determined to wage war against the fledgling drug lord Marlo Stanfield. As Avon's war against Marlo begins to draw more police attention, Proposition Joe and other Co-Op Members threaten to cut Stringer off from the Greeks' superior heroin supply until he can control Avon. In Stringer's view, this would make any victory over Marlo worthless, as street corners generate no money without drugs to sell on them.
When Stringer asserts his opposition to Avon's war against the Stanfield Crew, Avon accuses him of lacking the toughness necessary for their business—and based on the lack of progress on his condominiums, also accuses him of not being smart enough for the legitimate business world. This causes Stringer to angrily reassert his toughness by revealing that he had ordered D'Angelo's death. Stringer tells Avon that he chose to have D'Angelo killed because Avon himself would be unable to order the death of his own nephew, even if he knew that D'Angelo would eventually flip. 
Stringer's relationship with Avon is irreparably damaged by this revelation. While Avon eventually seems to come to terms with Stringer's confession, it compromised their brotherhood and Avon was no longer willing to protect Stringer from the repercussions of his other manipulations. Ultimately, the episode proves that Stringer's origins in the street have left him without the patience and restraint required to realize his greater ambitions.
Stringer's inroads into real estate are hamstrung by the nuances of a legitimate business world that he doesn't fully understand, with his condominium project repeatedly delayed by bureaucratic obstacles. Stringer is frustrated by what he perceives as inexcusable foot-dragging that would not be tolerated in the drug world. Worse, Stringer bribes Davis to connect his organization with federal housing grants, only to learn that Davis fabricated his federal contact and pocketed the money. Enraged, Stringer instructs Slim Charles to assassinate Davis, an order Avon immediately cancels.
Stringer's luck takes a turn for the worse when Kintell Williamson joins the New Day Co-Op and curbs his crew's violent tendencies. At the same time, Avon's war with Marlo is ratcheting up, and McNulty backdoors Lt. Daniels and goes straight to the Western District Commander, Major Howard Colvin, in order to refocus the Major Crimes Unit on Barksdale's once-again violent drug crew. This helps Freamon and Prez slowly gather conspiracy evidence against Stringer and his lieutenants, eventually catching Stringer making an incriminating phone call on one of his many phone lines. The Major Crimes Unit is finally ready to make a conclusive move against the Barksdale Crew, but just before warrants can be issued the Organization self-destructs in an ironic turn of events.
Stringer plans to regain control of the Barksdale organization by sending Avon back to prison, betraying the location of his safehouse to Baltimore Police major Howard "Bunny" Colvin. However, Stringer is simultaneously betrayed by Avon when Brother Mouzone confronts him about Stringer's plot to engineer a conflict between Mouzone and Omar Little. Mouzone tells Avon that he knew Stringer had intentionally fed Omar misinformation, and that he held Avon responsible for Stringer's actions, threatening to use his connections to cut off the Barksdale organization's supply of drugs from New York. In an effort to avoid a war with Mouzone, Avon reluctantly tells him Stringer's whereabouts. 
Shortly after Avon's meeting with Brother Mouzone, Avon and Stringer enjoy a last drink together at Avon's harbor-side condominium. They reminisce about the past and act as if their old friendship were still intact—despite each having betrayed the other. The next day Omar and Brother Mouzone track Stringer to his development site, kill his bodyguard and, after a tense confrontation, kill him. 
With Stringer dead and Avon imprisoned along with most of his men, the Barksdale organization crumbles. Slim Charles becomes de facto leader of what remains of the Barksdale crew, which he merges with Proposition Joe's drug operations. Marlo Stanfield becomes the new power in West Baltimore by default. 
After Stringer's death, Detective McNulty and the police search his apartment. The apartment is extremely clean, stylishly furnished and tastefully decorated. Far from any expectations of a drug kingpin, his bookshelf includes a copy of "The Wealth of Nations". McNulty expresses regret that he couldn't arrest his arch rival before he died. In the end, McNulty displays an odd admiration for Stringer's lofty dreams, and a grudging respect for his talent as a drug kingpin. In essence, McNulty feels purposeless without his adversary.
Legacy.
In the season five episode "Late Editions," Clay Davis, while describing to Lester Freamon how drug money is routed from the kingpins to state and city politicians through their lawyers, mentions how he conned a fellow named "Bell" into giving him a great deal of money because Davis had convinced him that he would be able to use his connections to push his development forward quickly. As Davis laughs about how he conned Stringer, Freamon's eyes light up in recognition.
Origins.
Stringer's name is a composite of two real Baltimore drug lords, Stringer Reed and Roland Bell. His story bears many similarities to the life of Kenneth A. Jackson—specifically, his crossover from the illegal drug trade to legitimate business ownership and political contributions.

Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka

Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka (, "Vechera na khutore bliz Dikan'ki") is a collection of short stories by Nikolai Gogol, written from 1831-1832. They appeared in various magazines and were published in book form when Gogol, who had spent his life in Ukraine up to the age of nineteen, was twenty-two. He put his early impressions and memories of childhood into these pictures of peasant life. In a series of letters to his mother, he asked her to write down descriptions of village customs, dress, superstitions, and old stories. These were also used as primary sources.
Stories.
"Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka" is separated into two volumes of four stories each:
Часть первая ["Chast' pervaya"], Part One
Часть вторая ["Chast' vtoraya"], Part Two
Significance.
This was Gogol's groundbreaking work, though not his first, and formed the core of his style, especially his sense of the macabre. It was this collection that proved he was a new power in Russian literature with unique innovation and a carefully arranged mingling of the horrifying and the humorous. Alexander Pushkin had a heavy influence on the writing of the collection, which features references to Ukraine, at that time referred to as "Little Russia", where Gogol spent the early years of his life. The stories are heavily laced with Ukrainian folklore and cultural references, offering a unique perspective into life in the country during Gogol's time period. The structure found in this collection became characteristic of Gogol's writing later on, found in works such as "Dead Souls". "Evenings" gained Gogol the fame that would lead him to a prominent placement in the Russian literary circle, as well as opening the doors for future works.
Preface.
The preface is the opening to the first volume of "Evenings on a Farm Near Dykanka" by Nikolai Gogol, written in 1831.
Each of the segments were based on Ukrainian folklore and feature comedic elements and a binding narrator, beekeeper Pan'ko-the-Redhaired, who is dictating the stories to the reader. A few other characters are mentioned in terms of the stories they provide, but regardless these segments are still told through the beekeeper Rudy.
This short section introduces the beekeeper Rudy Panko, who begins to introduce his task of informing the reader of a set of wondrous tales he has heard. He speaks very matter-of-factly and personally to the reader, as though they were sitting in front of him at his dinner table or outside in his village. He talks about the pleasant serenity of peasant life and mentions lavish parties. He continues about the storytelling at these nightly parties and then comments that no one can tell stories like Rudy Panko. His name means “red” in Ukrainian and is a nickname, again making it seem informal and personal since the narrator is using a personal name. He eventually gets caught up in talking about mundane events, and stops himself so he can get on with his storytelling. The main stories begin after this section.
Adaptations.
"Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka" has been adapted into film several times:

Hollywood Steps Out

Hollywood Steps Out is a 1941 short Merrie Melodies cartoon by Warner Bros., directed by Tex Avery. The cartoon features caricatures of Hollywood celebrities from the 1930s and early 1940s.
Plot.
A large bird's-eye view of Los Angeles is shown with beams of light moving to a conga beat. The action takes place in the famed Ciro's nightclub, where the Hollywood stars are having dinner - at $50 ($ today) a plate and "easy terms". The first stars seen are Claudette Colbert, Don Ameche and, at a table behind them, Adolphe Menjou and Norma Shearer, followed by Cary Grant, seated alone. Grant talks to himself: “What a place! What a place! It’s as pretty as a picture. But if I ever told my favorite wife the awful truth I'd land right on the front page. Yessireee Bobby.” (All these jokes are references to some of his films, except "The Front Page" which does not star Grant, but was remade as "His Girl Friday" in 1940, a film that does star him).
Then Greta Garbo comes along selling "cigars, cigarettes, butts." Grant buys some, tossing a quarter ($ today) into her tray and asks her for a light. Garbo lifts her enormous foot on the table and strikes a match on the shoe, then lights Grant’s cigarette. Garbo is considered even today to have been an extremely beautiful woman, but she did have very large feet, and this was caricatured repeatedly in Warner Brothers cartoons of the era.
In the next scene Edward G. Robinson asks Ann Sheridan: "How’s the Oomph girl tonight?" Sheridan responds by uttering the word "Oomph" several times. Her final "Oomph" surprises Robinson. (Sheridan was a sex symbol known as the "Oomph" girl in those years.)
The camera then tracks past some tables: the first one has Henry Binder and Leon Schlesinger sitting there as an in-joke, while the soundtrack quotes "Merrily We Roll Along" - the theme to the "Merrie Melodies" series. (Schlesinger was producer for the Looney Tunes cartoons and Binder was his assistant.) The camera shows some other tables which are reserved for people: Bette Davis, a large sofa for Kate Smith (a well known singer at the time, noted for her ample girth), and the last table isn't reserved for movie actors at all, but for comic strip (and movie and radio) characters: Blondie, Dagwood, and Baby Dumpling, with a fire hydrant for Daisy the dog.
Meanwhile, in the cloakroom Johnny Weissmuller has arrived. He leaves his overcoat behind to reveal his Tarzan outfit - with the single addition of tuxedo collar and black tie. Sally Rand (famous for her striptease acts and fan dance), leaves her trademark feather "fans" behind and leaves presumably naked, as only her hands are seen and not her entire self-figure. The hatcheck girl is Paulette Goddard.
In the next scene James Cagney informs Humphrey Bogart and George Raft that they must prepare to do something risky. The trio, all known for their “tough guy” roles, get ready, turn, and start pitching pennies. Harpo Marx, usually the prankster in the Marx Brothers films, sticks some matches under Garbo's foot, then lights it. Garbo reacts very slowly and coolly to the pain, a parallel to her serene and cool acting style by slowly saying, "Ouuchhh." Then Clark Gable spots a girl, whom he follows with his head turning around 180 degrees (Gable was known for his womanizing).
After this, Bing Crosby announces the first act that evening. During his speech he is interrupted by a jockey on a race horse (a reference to Crosby’s fondness for horse racing - he owned several race horses - and his lack of luck in that sport. Jokes about Crosby's horse racing passion would be referred to in other Warner Brothers cartoons as well, such as "The Old Grey Hare"). Crosby then introduces the first musical number by conductor Leopold Stokowski. Stokowski, seen with a snood containing his long hair, prepares himself dramatically and seriously to conducting what looks to be a classical orchestral arrangement. However, it’s the conga "Ahí, viene la conga" that he conducts, moving rhythmically to the beat as he does so.
The beat “does something” to Dorothy Lamour, who is seen sitting at a table with James Stewart. She begs him to go dancing with her. Stewart starts stuttering and hesitating, but in the end agrees to follow her to the dance floor. (Stewart was known for his "shy guy" type roles.) When she moves her body to the beat he gets scared and runs away, leaving a sign reading Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the title of one of his best-known films at that time.
The next shot shows Gable again, moving to the beat and at the same time following the girl he saw earlier.
Tyrone Power dances with Sonja Henie (known for her ice skating movies), who is still wearing her ice skates. Frankenstein's monster is dancing very stiffly and woodenly. The Three Stooges poke and smash each other in rhythm to the beat, a reference to their famous “poke in the eye” slapstick films. Oliver Hardy dances with someone as well and is shown from the back. When he turns his face to the camera he is revealed to be dancing with two girls at the same time; a double reference to Hardy's "ladies man" routine within the Laurel and Hardy series and also to his obesity. Cesar Romero, known for his roles as a Latin lover, dances with Rita Hayworth in another sendup or tease. The two are shown in the long shot to be dancing clumsily with almost no coordination. In reality, Hayworth and Romero were considered to be two of Hollywood's finest dancers.
The camera then cuts to Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland sitting at a table. The waiter brings an expensive bill, which shocks Rooney. He asks his “father”, Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone), for a favor. In the next scene both are seen washing the dishes to the conga beat (this is a reference to the Andy Hardy film series in which Rooney played the small town boy who always got into trouble with money and girls. Lewis Stone played the part of Andy’s father: Judge Hardy; Judy played Andy's girlfriend).
Gable is shown still following the girl, giving an aside to the audience: "Don't go away folks, this oughta be good!". Then Crosby introduces the final act, again interrupted by the same jockey on his race horse. Sally Rand (identified as "Sally Strand") performs the bubble dance to "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" in complete nudity, which is never seen although areas of her body get revealed. Strand is shown standing with her bright white bubble (it is never revealed how she got a bubble like that) held in front of her nude body center stage in a dim place, with a bright light shining on her to signal the start of the dance
Kay Kyser (a well-known band leader at the time, nicknamed “The Professor” because he and his band were featured on radio's "The Kollege Of Musical Knowledge") is shown dressed in his "Professor" Square academic cap. He is excited by the act and shouts out: “Students!” (his catchphrase on the radio show; whenever a contestant missed an answer, he called out to his audience for the correct answer) A group of people look, whistle in unison and exclaim: “Baby!” They are William Powell, Spencer Tracy, Ronald Colman and Errol Flynn. Sitting down are Wallace Beery and C. Aubrey Smith. Peter Lorre, known for his portrayal of sinister and weird characters, says dreamingly: “I haven't seen such a beautiful bubble since I was a child.” This is a possible reference to Lorre's breakthrough film role in Europe, a movie titled "M", in which Lorre played a murderous child molester. Henry Fonda enjoys the act too, but is pulled away by his mother. This is a reference to the popular radio show The Aldrich Family which always opened with the cry: "Hen-RYYYYY! Henry Aldrich!" by the mother of the teenage title character, Henry Aldrich, who always replied, "Coming, Mother!" J. Edgar Hoover says “Gee!” several times as a pun to his function as G-man. Boris Karloff, Arthur Treacher, Buster Keaton and Mischa Auer watch the spectacle without any emotion (typical for their film roles; all were known for playing dour, deadpan roles). Ned Sparks, another famous movie "grouch" asks them if they are having a good time. They all respond in unison with a terse and dry: “Yes.” Jerry Colonna reacts in excitement to the act and utters his catchphrases “Guess who?”, and the camera reveals an invisible character next to him: “Yehudi!” (“Where's Yehudi?” was a catch phrase Colonna was famous for, referring to a violinist he could never find, hence an "invisible man".) The camera zooms back to Strand lifting up her bubble, whereupon the camera follows the bubble with Sally out of sight, thus never revealing the nude dancer, and the bubble comes back down again and Sally catches it and she is once again holding the bubble in front of her.
Finally Harpo Marx shoots the bubble with a slingshot. The bubble explodes and Sally Rand is shown wearing a barrel underneath. She reacts with shock, and the curtains close to signify the end of the dance. The conga stops and the cartoon cuts to Gable who has finally caught the girl he was chasing, insisting she kiss him. "She" turns out to be Groucho Marx in drag -- "Well, fancy meeting you here!"
Censorship.
When aired on The WB!, two scenes are cut: one where Greta Garbo (as a cigarette girl) offers Cary Grant a cigarette and lights it with the sole of her large high heeled shoe and another where Harpo Marx puts a row of matches under Garbo's shoe and lights them, giving her a hotfoot, only to have her slowly react to the pain.
