Sunday Morning (The Velvet Underground song)

"Sunday Morning" is a song by the Velvet Underground. It is the opening track on their 1967 debut album "The Velvet Underground & Nico". It was also released as a single in 1966 with "Femme Fatale".
Recording.
In late 1966, "Sunday Morning" was the final song to be recorded for "The Velvet Underground & Nico". It was requested by Tom Wilson, who thought the album needed another song with lead vocals by Nico with the potential to be a successful single. The final master tape of side one of the album shows "Sunday Morning" only penciled in before "I'm Waiting for the Man".
Wilson brought the band into a New York City recording studio in November. The song was written with Nico's voice in mind by Lou Reed and John Cale on a Sunday morning. The band previously performed it live with Nico singing lead, but when it came time to record it, Lou Reed sang the lead vocal. Nico would instead sing backing vocals on the song.
Aiming to create a hit for the album, "Sunday Morning" features noticeably more lush and professional production than the rest of the songs on the album. The song's prominent use of celesta was the idea of John Cale, who noticed the instrument in the studio and decided to use it for the song.
Cover versions.
"Sunday Morning" has been covered by various bands, including Rusty, Villagers, Bettie Serveert, Beck, Chris Coco & Nick Cave, Nina Hagen, James, Oh-OK, Elizabeth Cook, NY Loose, The Feelies, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, the Queers, Strawberry Switchblade, Wally Pleasant, and Matthew Sweet & Susanna Hoffs. Japanese rock duo the Flare, composed of Sugizo and Yuna Katsuki, included a cover on their 2004 single "Uetico". The alternative rock Japanese band The Teenage Kissers made a cover and released it on their first full album Virgin Field. The song has also been covered by Belle & Sebastian during live shows. A live version recorded by Oh-OK is compiled on "The Complete Recordings".
A cover of the song by the Doug Anthony All Stars was used in a season 1 episode of "DAAS Kapital", but did not appear on the DVD set of the sci-fi sitcom due to "contractual reasons... and because we never paid to use it in the first place," according to Paul McDermott.
The chord progression is used in Kramer's "Don't Come Around", which includes the lyric, "I love this song," presumably referring to the Velvet Underground song rather than the Kramer song.

Saalburg-Ebersdorf

Saalburg-Ebersdorf is a town in the Saale-Orla-Kreis district, in Thuringia, Germany close to the Bavarian border. It is situated on the river Saale, 10 km southwest of Schleiz, 30 km west of Plauen and 30 km north-west of Hof.
The town is an administrative union of two large villages (Saalburg and Ebersdorf) lying either side of the Saale river near the Bleilochtalsperre as well as several smaller villages in between and around them.
History.
The earliest records of the towns and villages of Saalburg-Ebersdorf are from the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries. They lay on and around the historical trade route between Nuremberg and Leipzig.
Saalburg and Ebersdorf became increasingly important in the Seventeenth Century as regional seats of the Counts von Reuss.
Saalburg.
Saalburg was established under the Lobdaburger reign in around 1313. Some ruins from this early settlement remain today, including a 3-meter-high remnant of the city wall.
From 1647-1666, Saalburg was the seat of the state of Reuss-Saalburg.
Saalburg subsequently became part of the state of Reuss-Greiz (or Reuss Elder Line).
Ebersdorf.
Ebersdorf dates its foundation to 1401.
In 1678, the state of Reuss-Lobenstein was partitioned and the state of Reuss-Ebersdorf was created under Heinrich X. Schloss Ebersdorf was built in 1692-1694 to house the court of the new state.
Under the influence of the Reuss Princes, Ebersdorf became a centre of Pietism in Germany. The related Moravian faith also took a minority hold in EbersdorfF after the marriage of Erdmuthe Dorothea Reuss-Ebersdorf to Nicolaus Zinzendorf. The Moravian Church (pictured) was built in 1746. The classical west facade of Schloss Ebersdorf, shown in the main photo above, was designed by Christian Friedrich Schuricht and was completed in 1792.
Napoleonic wars and German confederation.
On 8 October 1806, Napoleon's troops first entered Prussian territory and battles took place on the banks of the Saale between the forces of Napoleon I of France and Frederick William III of Prussia. Napoleon spent the night of 8 October in Schloss Ebersdorf. This (a precursor to the Battle of Schleiz on 9 October and the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt on 14 October), was the first battle of the War of the Fourth Coalition.
From 1807 until 1813, the Principality of Reuss-Ebersdorf became part of the Confederation of the Rhine. From 1813, the Principality became a member (successively) of the German Confederation the Thuringian Trade Association, the Central German Trade Association and (from 1833) the Zollverein. In 1849, the Principality became a constitutional monarchy. During the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Principality took a neutral position while the Reuss, Elder Line was aligned with the Austrian Empire. Both joined the North German Confederation in 1866 and became part of unified Germany in 1871.
Twentieth Century.
In 1919, Ebersdorf became part of the independent (and short-lived) Republic of Reuss, before this state (and hence Ebersdorf) joined the Weimar Republic.
After the Second World War, the region became part of the newly created District of Gera (Bezirk Gera) in 1952 within the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). After German reunification in 1990, Salburg and Ebersdorf became part of the restored state of Thuringia.
After the Second World War, the region became part of the newly created District of Gera (Bezirk Gera) in 1952 within the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). After German reunification in 1990, Salburg and Ebersdorf became part of the restored state of Thuringia.
Formation of Saalburg-Ebersdorf.
Saalburg and Ebersdorf were legally merged on 1 January 2003 and, on 6 May 2006, they absorbed the previously independent municipalities of Friesau, Röppisch, Schönbrunn and Zoppoten.
SonneMondSterne.
Saalburg-Ebersdorf hosts the SonneMondSterne festival, an outdoor music festival which is one of the largest in Europe and which has featured acts such as Massive Attack; David Guetta; Skrillex; The Chemical Brothers; Hot Chip; Faithless; Kraftwerk; and Underworld.
Twinning.
Saalburg-Ebersdorf is twinned with Renningen (Baden-Württemberg).
Famous residents.
Countess Augusta Reuss-Ebersdorf, daughter of Count Heinrich XXIV, was the mother of Leopold I of Belgium and Victoria, Duchess of Kent and grandmother of both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.
Heinrich LXXII met Lola Montez in London in the middle of 1843 and gave her a loose invitation to visit him in Ebersdorf. Her visit was not a success and she was quickly moved on again.
Erdmuthe Dorothea, Countess von Reuss-Ebersdorf (1700–1757) married Nicolaus Ludwig, Imperial Count von Zinzendorf (1700–1760) Renewer of the Moravian Church in 1722. Her family became very involved in the Moravian Church and a Moravian Settlement was started in Ebersdorf in the 1730s. The settlement was a center of education and social work in the Thuringian Forest. Today the Moravian Church operates a children's home and retreat center in the Congregation in Ebersdorf.

They meet and fall in love at the age of 23, after which it is discovered that they were born on the same night and switched at birth. Jorge Luis's father, angry about their marriage, takes her to Dr. Buitriago, her teacher, when Jorge Luis is not there. Dr. Buitriago makes her believe that he raped her. When her true identity is discovered, her real father repents, but nothing can be done. She is pregnant, and Jorge Luis, believing the child is not his, asks her to abort it. But Topacio goes with her foster mother Domiltila to Caracas, where she has her baby. Jorge Luis annuls their marriage. Dr. Andrade operates her and she recovers her vision. Aurelio and Blanca accept her, but she insists on taking care of herself. Dr. Andrade wants to marry her but arranges for her to work in the same hospital as Jorge Luis, to see if any reconciliation is possible. Dr. Buitriago appears, because of intrigue by the fiance of Jorge Luis and his (actually Topacio's) aunt. He claims her child, until at his death he confesses to Jorge Luis that nothing ever happened between them and the child is actully the son of Jorge Luis. Only after Jorge Luis realizes how selfish he was towards Topacio, and repents so much he becomes blind, does Dr. Andrade understand that Topacio really loves Jorge Luis and lets her go. Her pending marriage to Dr. Andrade is cancelled and she returns to Jorge Luis and they marry.
Theme song.
The theme song to "Topacio" is "Que por qué te quiero", performed by Carlos Mata. The song was later covered by the tejano band Mazz.

Michael Clayton (film)

Michael Clayton is a 2007 American legal thriller film written and directed by Tony Gilroy, starring George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton and Sydney Pollack. The film chronicles the attempts by attorney Michael Clayton to cope with a colleague's apparent mental breakdown, and the corruption and intrigue surrounding a major client of his law firm being sued in a class action case over the effects of toxic agrochemicals.
The film received positive reviews and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Gilroy and Best Actor for Clooney, with Swinton winning the award for Best Supporting Actress.
Plot.
Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a "fixer" in a prestigious New York City law firm, using his connections and his knowledge of legal loopholes for his clients' benefit. After leaving an underground poker game and dealing with a wealthy client's (Denis O'Hare) hit and run, Michael drives despondently and stops at a remote field, where some horses are standing on a hill. When he leaves his car to climb up the hill to admire the horses (although it is not apparent why he has done this), the car explodes behind him.
Four days earlier, it is revealed that Michael is a divorced father of one, and is $75,000 in debt from a previous restaurant investment he entered with his brother Timmy that faltered when the brother used the restaurant's funds to fuel his drug habits. Michael, having gone to a loan shark to raise the money for the investment, refuses to give his brother's exact location and is held responsible for the debt. He is eventually given one week to come up with the money. Meanwhile, one of the firm's leading attorneys, Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson), has a bizarre outburst in the middle of a deposition in Milwaukee involving a class action lawsuit against U-North, an agricultural products conglomerate. Michael arrives in Milwaukee and bails Arthur out of jail, but he escapes from their hotel room in the middle of the night. Meanwhile, Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), U-North's general counsel, discovers that Arthur had come into possession of a confidential U-North document detailing the company's decision to manufacture a weed killer that it knew to be carcinogenic. Karen brings this to the attention of U-North's CEO. He puts Karen in contact with two men who are secretly on retainer by U-North (Robert Prescott, Terry Serpico). She contracts them to follow Arthur and plant bugs in his apartment and phone. When they report that Arthur is building a case to expose his own client, Karen asks that Arthur be eliminated. The same two men proceed to do as she directs. They secretly murder Arthur in a very sophisticated way designed to resemble a heart attack, possibly brought on by a drug overdose.
Michael is saddened by the actual news of Arthur's death, but becomes suspicious upon learning that U-North was planning a settlement just a few days before and that Arthur had booked a flight to New York for one of the plaintiffs, Anna (Merritt Wever). He learns from Anna that she told no one of her conversations with Arthur, not even her attorney, arousing in Michael further suspicion about how his firm came to know of Arthur's conversations with the U-North plaintiffs. With the help of his other brother Gene (Sean Cullen) in the police department Michael gets access to Arthur's sealed apartment. There he discovers that Arthur seems to be have been expecting Anna, as there is a bottle of champagne with two glasses in the refrigerator. There is a copy of a fantasy novel called Realm and Conquest that Michael's eleven year old son Henry has been absorbed in, and has recommended it to Arthur to read. Arthur has clearly read the book, having made annotations and highlighted numerous passages in the book. One of the illustrations in the book is of a horse standing on a hillside. Also in the book Michael finds a receipt from a copy store. At this point Michael is arrested for trespassing on sealed premises, and his brother Gene has to arrange for his release from custody. Next Michael discovers that Arthur had ordered three thousand copies of the confidential U-North document. Michael takes a copy with him, but the two hit men are tailing him and inform Karen of the situation. Michael is about to show his boss, Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack), what he has discovered, only to be offered a renewal of his employment contract as well as an $80,000 bonus he had requested to cover his debt, although it comes with a confidentiality agreement to prevent him from ever shaking down the firm, with Marty already knowing the shady nature of U-North, though not of the murder.
One of the hit men rigs his car with a bomb. Michael receives a phone call summoning him to the meeting with the client in Westchester County who had committed a hit-and-run, as seen at the start of the movie. He is being followed by the two men, but they have trouble tailing him. The surveillance team, still off but near Michael's trail, detonates the remote bomb while he is out of the car standing in the field with the horses. An unharmed but startled Michael runs back to his now-burning car and throws his personal effects into the fire to fake his death and escapes into the woods.
Later, at a U-North board meeting, Karen proposes approval of a new settlement agreement. Michael is waiting for her when she exits the conference room, and informs her that he has access to copies of the U-North memo and that he knows about her role in Arthur's murder, and her subsequent unsuccessful attempt to kill him. He goads Karen into offering him $10 million for his silence. Karen reluctantly agrees, prompting Michael to reveal the phone in his pocket that has conveyed their conversation to the police. As he walks away, Karen falls to her knees in shock while detectives rush forward to arrest her. Michael leaves the building and hails a cab, he passes the driver 50 dollars and tells him to "just drive."

Director Tony Gilroy succeeds not only in capturing the audience's attention, but holding it until the credits roll." At Metacritic the film received an average score of 82 out of 100 based on 36 reviews from professional critics, indicating "universal acclaim." Owen Gleiberman of "Entertainment Weekly" gave it an 'A' saying that it was "better than good, it just about restores your faith." Roger Ebert gave it a 4-star review and Richard Roeper named it the best film of the year. It was also Richard Schickel's top film of 2007, and he called it "a morally alert, persuasively realistic and increasingly suspenseful melodrama, impeccably acted and handsomely staged by Tony Gilroy". The reviews on Box Office Mojo give the movie a normal B. "Time" magazine said that ""Michael Clayton" is not an exercise in high-tension energy; you'll never confuse its eponymous protagonist with Jason Bourne. But it does have enough of a melodramatic pulse to keep you engaged in its story and, better than that, it is full of plausible characters who are capable of surprising—and surpassing—your expectations".

Charles William Tate (February 20, 1919 – June 10, 1996) was an American football player and coach. Tate served as the head coach of the University of Miami for six seasons during the 1960s and two games during the 1970 season.
He was born in the small town of Tracy City, Tennessee, and later attended Julia E. Landon High School in Jacksonville, Florida.
Tate attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he was a starting fullback for coach Josh Cody and coach Tom Lieb's Florida Gators football teams from 1939 to 1941. Memorably, he scored the Gators' only touchdown in their 7–7 tie of the Auburn Tigers in the first varsity game ever played in the Tigers' new Auburn Stadium. Tate graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in education in 1942.
Tate was the head football coach of the Miami Hurricanes football team at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, from 1964 to 1970. In six seasons and part of a seventh, he compiled an overall win-loss record of 34–27–3. His best season with the Hurricanes came in 1966, when his team went 8–2–1 and won the Liberty Bowl against Virginia Tech. Tate's departure from Miami was surrounded by controversy and attracted national media attention when he abruptly resigned as the Hurricanes' athletic director and head football coach after the second game of the 1970 football season.
Chuck Foreman was Tate's most famous recruit in the late 1960s. When interviewed at the ESPN Club in Orlando, Florida, Foreman, who went on to have a great career in the NFL for the Minnesota Vikings, said of Tate, "He had faith in me, as a black athlete in the South during that tumultuous time, and I will never forget him. He was a great, generous man."
He was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 1988. He died in 1996 from complications related to pneumonia and Alzheimer's disease.

Isca sullo Ionio

Isca sullo Ionio () is a "comune" and town in the province of Catanzaro in the Calabria region of Italy.
The Origin of Isca
Isca is of Greek Origin and as legend states the original name of the town was Sanagasi. The original town was located near the sea, probably about where Isca Marina is located today. Its been said that the original location was abandoned, due to the incursions of outsiders. Sometime, probably during the 9th Century, the inhabitants moved to higher ground, where present day Isca is today, perched between two mountains, with a wide clear view of the sea. The high open view of the sea offered protection for the people, giving them time to prepare for a possible 
attack. The mountains that surround Isca on three sides, also made it difficult for outsiders to enter Isca from anywhere except from the shoreline. With a warm summer climate, the area is known for growing lemons, oranges, figs, chestnuts, grapes and beans.
San Marziale
Saint Marziale was made the official Patron Saint of Isca, when in August 1726, the Mayor of Isca addressed the Bishop of Squillace Monsignor Mark Antonio Attaffi. The Mayor asked the Bishop for acknowledgement of the Relic and positioning of the Relic to guard in the Altar. To hold Festivals for the Saint and the license to be able to expose the Relic in every necessity and occurrence of the public. The Bishop approved the request and gave the Mayor permission on August 11, 1726. A year later on August 30, 1727 the town administrators, the proxy and clergy did underwrite obligation to San Marziale. The public did except Marziale as their Patron and for being their protector from Plague, Hunger, Earthquakes and the Turks. Until today, the people of Isca are forever thankful to their protector San Marziale. They pay homage to their Saint, with religious festivities, every year in May, to mark the anniversary of the Earthquake of 1947. The official Feast Day for San Marziale is in July, but the town celebrates it in August, when most of the people come home to Isca for vacation, from the North and other places throughout the world. The feast is celebrated every year in Isca communities in Philadelphia, Kulpmont Pennsylvania, Toronto and Montreal Canada and Australia. San Marziale protects his faithful flock, wherever life takes them.
Earthquakes
November 5, 1659: A Violent Earthquake struck the town at about midnight. Killing 14 people.
February 5, 1783: A devastating Earthquake rocked Calabria, with 331 people perishing in a nearby town of Borgia. Isca was spared of any loss of life. The churches of Isca were heavily damaged.
September 8, 1905: Isca had the good fortune of no loss of life. The epicenter was located near the Gulf of S. Eufemia.
December 28, 1908: This historic earthquake killed 65,000 people in Messina, Sicily and 25,000 in the Province of Reggio Calabria.
May 11, 1947: This earthquake, whick struck at 7:30 am, is still on the minds of many people today and from a standpoint of destruction to property, which was surely the most devastating earthquake in the town's history. Three hundred homes were destroyed, as were the churches. Hundreds of families were left homeless. The most amazing part of the story is only two people died in this earthquake, a 73 year old and an 8 year old. Many stories have been told about this earthquake and San Marziale's intervention. Though it is not the month in which he is celebrated, every year in May, Isca honors San Marziale, in remembrance of the historic day and to give thanks to their patron and protector.
Isca Marina
In the immediate days following the Earthquake of 1947, talks began and planning of a new community or extension to Isca, that should be built on safer flat ground, near the beach. The name for the new community, would be called Isca Marina. Nine centuries earlier, the area now known as Isca Marina, was the original town location for the ancestors of Isca, until invasions of outsiders, forced the towns people, to higher ground. Now 
many hundreds of descendants of the original town location have come home. While some homes were being built in the late 1940s in the Marina, it wasn't until early 1950's did roads, sidewalks and town square be built. A water supply was established in 1951. Electricity reached the town in 1953. The Elementary School was completed for the scholastic year 1956/57. Functional public lighting was completed in 1958. In the years to 
follow, Isca Marina would become a popular and beautiful vacation destination for Italian and Foreign travelers, on summer holiday.

Central Christian Church (Austin, Texas)

Central Christian Church is a major church in downtown Austin, Texas affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Organized in 1847, it is one of the oldest congregations in the city.
The church has also been known as Christian Church of Austin. The current church building, featuring Romanesque architecture, was completed in 1929. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
Texas Historical Commission Marker Text.
In 1847, eight years after the City of Austin was platted, ten members of the Disciples of Christ Brotherhood met to organize this congregation. Although early records of the church are scarce, it is known that regular worship services were being held in a local school building by 1852. The Christian Church of Austin, as the congregation originally was known, acquired its first property at Eighth and Colorado Streets and worshiped at that site until moving to this location in 1929. An early dispute over theological and procedural matters split the congregation in 1888. Until 1896, when the Rev. S. D. Dutcher was appointed pastor, leaders of the church were selected from among the laity. The fellowship adopted its current name during the early years of the twentieth century, after other Disciples of Christ congregations had been organized in Austin. Although much growth has occurred in the outlying sections of the city, Central Christian Church has remained a vital force in the downtown area. Its ministry has included the establishment of several other congregations. As one of the oldest churches in Austin, Central Christian has provided the city with significant service and leadership.

The Reverend Eric Gates is the current senior minister.

Horst Fascher

Horst Fascher (born 5 February 1936, Hamburg) is a previous German nightclub bouncer, and a friend of The Beatles during their days playing in Hamburg, Germany.
A onetime professional boxer whose career was cut short (he had unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight), Fascher found work in clubs along the Reeperbahn in Hamburg. When the Beatles (including original drummer Pete Best and bassist Stuart Sutcliffe) made their first trip to Germany in August 1960, Fascher befriended the young group, who played at the Indra Club and the Kaiserkeller.
As they rose through the ranks of bands playing the Reeperbahn (making five trips in all over the next two-and-a-half years), Fascher usually managed to be working at the same clubs, and for the same boss, as the Beatles. They visited him at home, and he in turn kept troublemakers away from the band. The only favour Fascher asked was to be able to sing with them occasionally onstage, which was granted; Eddie Cochran's music was a common choice.
The Beatles (with Best now replaced by Ringo Starr, and Paul McCartney changing to bass when Sutcliffe departed) did not want to make their last Hamburg visit, at the end of 1962, preferring to stay in England to promote their new single, "Love Me Do", but were persuaded by manager Brian Epstein, via Horst Fascher, who recalled later "I had to give him thirty marks under the table to make him do it." Nonetheless, the band had a holiday residency at the Star-Club (which Fascher co-ran), through the New Year.
Fascher guested with the Beatles during their New Year's Eve show, which was recorded by another Liverpool musician, Ted "Kingsize" Taylor. Years later (in 1977), the tape was released commercially as "Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962". A song from the album, "Hallelujah, I Love Her So", features Horst Fascher's vocals. Another song, "Be-Bop-A-Lula", features his brother Fred's vocals.
Fascher remained a friend and admirer of the band years after they became famous. Some of his stories about the band's Hamburg days (and his impressions of the young Beatles) have found their way into music biographies, including Philip Norman's "Shout!". His own memoir was published in 2006.

A Ninki Nanka is a legendary creature in West African folklore. Descriptions of the creature vary, but most contend that the animal is reptilian and possibly dragon-like. 
According to tradition, the Ninki Nanka lives in the swamps of West Africa. The animal is said to be extremely large and very dangerous. It is said that when children get too confident and feel they can disobey their parents and go into the swamp they will be taken by the Ninki Nanka. This creature's tales were never recorded in any sort of non-modern text but the story of it has spread from tribe to tribe all over Africa. There is a song called "Ninki Nanka" on the album "Casamance au clair de lune" (1984) by the Senegalese music group Touré Kunda.
A group of "dragon hunters" from the Centre for Fortean Zoology (CFZ) went to Gambia in the summer of 2006 to investigate the Ninki Nanka and take testimony from those who have claimed to have seen the mythical creature. One interviewee who claimed to have had an encounter with a Ninki Nanka said it looked similar to an image of a Chinese dragon. The expedition, known as the "J. T. Downes Memorial Gambia Expedition 2006", received a fair amount of media attention, including coverage in a BBC Online article.

Nehwon

Nehwon is the fictional world created by Fritz Leiber in which his heroes, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, adventure. It is notable for the city of Lankhmar.
"Nehwon", the reverse spelling of "No When", alludes to Erewhon.
Sundered from us by gulfs of time and stranger dimensions dreams the ancient world of Nehwon with its towers and skulls and jewels, its swords and sorceries. Nehwon's known realms crowd about the Inner Sea: northward the green-forested fierce Land of the Eight Cities, eastward the steppe-dwelling Mingol horsemen and the desert where caravans creep from the rich Eastern Lands and the River Tilth. But southward, linked to the desert only by the Sinking Land and further warded by the Great Dike and the Mountains of Hunger, are the rich grain fields and walled cities of Lankhmar, eldest and chiefest of Nehwon's lands. Dominating the Land of Lankhmar and crouching at the silty mouth of the River Hlal in a secure corner between the grain fields, the Great Salt Marsh, and the Inner Sea is the massive-walled and mazy-alleyed metropolis of Lankhmar, thick with thieves and shaven priests, lean-framed magicians and fat-bellied merchants—Lankhmar the Imperishable, the City of the Black Toga.—From "Induction" by Fritz Lieber
Technology in Nehwon varies between the Iron Age and the medieval. Leiber wrote of Lankhmarts: "They may be likened to the Romans or be thought of as, if I may use such a term, southern medievals." About his Eastern Lands, he wrote "think of Saracens, Arabs, Parthians, Assyrians even. They ride the camel and elephant, and use the bow extensively."
The Great Cities.
Ilthmar.
Ilthmar is a rival city to Lankhmar, located across the Great Salt Marsh and then the Sinking Land from Lankhmar, on the edge of the Deserts. Its people are known as Ilthmarts, and are known for their gambling, their heartlessness, and their worship of rat and shark gods. The harbor of Ilthmar is kept full of sharks for getting rid of criminals and undesirables.
Lankhmar.
Lankhmar may be the center of Nehwon, and many of the adventures in the stories hold some connection to this place. It is a large and decadent city, ruled by the Overlord Karstak Ovartamortes (at least in theory).

College of Coastal Georgia

The College of Coastal Georgia (also known as CCGA) is a public college located in historic downtown Brunswick, Georgia, United States. The College was established in 1961 and opened in 1964, making it one of Georgia's newest state colleges. The college is currently transitioning from a two-year community college into a four-year comprehensive institution and conferred its first baccalaureate degrees on May 7, 2011.
History.
The Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia established the college, originally known as Brunswick College, in 1961 with Brunswick and Glynn County citizens providing a $1 million bond issue for construction of buildings and purchase of land. The college opened in 1964 and shortly after changed its name to Brunswick Junior College in 1965. The college continued expanding the academic facilities on the college's campus through the late 1960s and 1970s. In 1972 the college added technical programs in addition to the traditional junior college programs and offered both associate programs in higher education and postsecondary technical and adult programs until 2008.
In 1986 the University System of Georgia Board of Regents created the Brunswick Center Consortium composed of Brunswick Junior College, Armstrong Atlantic State University, and Georgia Southern University. As part of the consortium the two university provided the college's students with opportunities to begin schooling at the community college and complete education in one of seven bachelor degree programs and seven graduate degree programs through one of the two universities. In 1988 the college name reverted to Brunswick College after the Board of Regents voted to drop "Junior" from the names of all state two-year colleges.
During the late 1980s and 1990s the college grew into a comprehensive community college, offering over 39 associate degrees, 21 vocational and technical certificate programs. The Board of Regents authorized the creation of the Camden Center location in Kingsland in response to growing populations in expanding population of Camden County. The college transformed the former Kingsland Elementary School into the extension location and opened the facility in January 1993. The center offers general education transfer and vocational/technical programs. In 1996 Brunswick College changed its name to Coastal Georgia Community College. In 2004 the Kingsland location moved into the a new facility in Kingsland and became known as The Camden Center at The Lakes.
Recent expansion.
In 2008 the college began transitioning from community college to a four-year college when it announced its 10-year strategic plan for the college. The plans include expansion of academic programs and infrastructure to accommodate an enrollment of more than 10,000. In addition to academic and physical expansion the expansion plans include addition student and residence life programs, as well as expanded athletics. That same year, the vocational and technical programs were transferred to Golden Isles Career Academy in Brunswick, Okefenokee Technical College in Waycross, and Altamaha Technical College in Jesup and the college changed its name to the College of Coastal Georgia. In 2009 the college began offering its first bachelor's degree programs in business administration, early childhood and special education, and middle school education began in fall 2009 and added a bachelor's degree in nursing in 2010. Shortly after the transition to a four-year college began in 2009 College of Coastal Georgia saw a peak enrollment of over 3,000 students.
The Health and Science Building opened in early 2011 at a cost of $15.8 million., followed in March 2011, by the announcement that the House Appropriations Committee of Georgia approved $7.6 million for a classroom and laboratory building, known as the Correll Teacher Education and Learning Center. Opened on January 2013, the new building is connected to the Jones Science Building and Academic Commons North and the two older buildings were renovated as part of the project. CTELC includes space for teacher education classes and is located in close proximity to the Brunswick High School, located just off the campus, allowing education majors access to teaching practicum opportunities and helping to facilitate early college entrance for high school students. The building also has multiple high-tech classrooms for other subjects, and is home to the Office of Service Learning and the Writing Center.
On May 7, 2011, the college conferred the first ever baccalaureate degrees. In July 2011, the college opened the new $12 million student center that includes: dining areas, the campus bookstore with a cafe, a theater, as well as study and recreational areas for students. The college also opened a 352-bed residential building at the cost $14 million, as the college's first student housing structure in August 2011. The three-story building features suite-style dorms with individual bedrooms connected to a common living area.
The opening of CTELC marked an end to the explosion of rapid growth on campus. Currently, the only project in progress is the building of the Founder's Gate. However, President Hepburn is working on securing over $2 million to renovate the Academic Commons South, the main classroom building and the only one that has not been renovated yet. The college master plan predicts building another dormitory and a new parking lot, but when and whether that will happen remains to be seen.
Campus.
CCGA's main campus runs north and south, parallel to Altama Avenue. It consists of a pedestrian mall and a large outdoor square in the middle flanked by Mariner Way in the south, College Drive in the north, and a parking lot on the east side of campus. The Health and Science Building and the Gould Memorial Library lie on the south end while the Campus Center and the Academic Commons North on the north end. The most southern building is the Conference Center and the most northern is the Coffin Building and one of the two parking lots. The only buildings on the east side of campus, beyond the other of the two parking lots, are the Student Activity Center and the dorm.
Camden Center.
The Regents authorized a satellite location to serve Camden County residents in 1992 and classes began in the former Kingsland Elementary School in 1993. A new permanent facility, the Camden Center, opened in 2004.
Academics.
The College of Coastal Georgia is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and has had continuous accreditation since 1967. The college offers various majors and areas of study and confers associate degrees and bachelor's degrees from its four schools: 
In the fall of 2012, CCGA combined The School of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (AHSS) and the School of Mathematics and Natural Science into one School of Arts and Science. Dr. Keith Belcher, who was dean of the latter School, became the Dean for the new school. Dr. Hambright, the dean of the former school, went back to being a full professor of Psychology. The School of Arts of Science currently offers Bachelor's of Science in Biology, Mathematics, and Psychology as well as a variety of associate degrees.
The School of Business and Public Affairs (SBPA) began in 2009 and enrolls approximately 700 students. The school offers degrees in BBA with a variety of concentrations, and in fall 2012, added degrees in Criminal Justice and Public Management. The school also offers a variety of associate degrees in business, computer science, criminal justice, health informatics, hospitality management, and community & organizational leadership. The School of Education and Teacher Preparation offers a Bachelor of Education in Early Childhood/Special Education, a Bachelor of Science in Middle Grades Education, and an Associate of Science degree with a concentration in Teacher Education for Early Childhood, Middle Grades, and Secondary Education. The School of Nursing and Health Sciences offers a Baccalaureate degree in Nursing (Prelicensure BSN and RN to BSN), and Career Associate of Science degrees in Nursing (RN) and Radiologic Science.
Athletics.
Coastal Georgia (CCGA) teams, nicknamed athletically as the Mariners, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC). Men's sports include basketball, golf and tennis; while women's sports include basketball, golf, softball, tennis and volleyball.
Coastal Georgia is currently a provisional member of the NAIA. CCGA became a member of the SSAC in the 2012-13 academic year after becoming a full member of NAIA following the one-year provisional period.
Until 2011 the college competed in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and as a member of the Georgia Collegiate Athletic Association. As part of the college's transformation from a two-year junior college to a four-year institution, Coastal Georgia applied for membership in the NAIA after exploring option to join the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The college also began expanding athletics in 2010 with the additions of men's and women's golf and tennis for the 2010-11 academic year, in which both golf programs placed in the top-10 nationally in the NJCAA championship tournament. The school added women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, women's volleyball, men's and women's soccer and baseball over the next five years.

Bioenergy village

A bio-energy village is a regionally oriented concept for the use of renewable energy sources in rural areas. The system uses biomass from local agriculture and forestry in a biogas powerplant to meet the complete energy requirements of a village, such as electricity and district heating.
These villages tend to be self-powered and independent from external grids, despite being connected to overland grids for feeding surplus energy. The term "bio-energy village" refers to a dependency on fresh biological material as a source of energy only whereas an "ecovillage" includes a variety of networks.
Examples of such villages are Jühnde near Göttingen, Mauenheim near Tuttlingen and Bollewick near Berlin in Germany.
Energy production.
Liquid manure, grass, silage and other raw materials from agriculture are fermented in a biological gas facility. The biogas produced fuels a combined heat and power plant (CHP). The heat is distributed via a district heating system while power is fed into a local electricity grid. In winter, additional heat requirements can be supplied by a supplementary heating plant, in which wood chips or straw are burned.
Existing projects.
Jühnde.
The first bio-energy village in Germany is Jühnde in the district of Göttingen. A project initiated by the Interdisciplinary Centre For Sustainable Development (IZNE) at the University of Göttingen, and completed in January 2006, the project supplies the village with the heat that it requires and produces twice as much electricity as is used. It has been estimated that the participating households save €750 per year in energy costs.
Mauenheim.
In Mauenheim, Baden-Württemberg, a bio-energy village has been developed in Immendingen in the district of Tuttlingen, with approximately 400 inhabitants and 148 buildings. The biogas facility and wood chip heating system are supplemented by a solar energy system. The project started operation in 2006. It has been calculated that about 1900 tonnes of CO2 per year will be saved.
Rai Breitenbach.
The Breuberger village of Rai Breitenbach in the Odenwald (approximately 890 inhabitants) is in the process of becoming a bio-energy village. At present the project is still in the planning stage. A feasibility study has been completed and a co-operative created to carry out the project, which is expected to be completed in 2008.
Freiamt.
The village Freiamt in the Black Forest with 4300 inhabitants is using all forms of renewable energy. A biogas plant, Solar power, wind and water energy produce about 14 million kwh energy annually, about 3 million more than needed. Around 150 solar collectors are used for water heating.

Turquoise-throated puffleg

The turquoise-throated puffleg ("Eriocnemis godini"), also known as Godin's puffleg, is a possibly extinct hummingbird from Ecuador and Colombia.
Description.
Based on the few known specimens, it has a total length of 10-11 centimetres. The plumage of the male is predominantly green with a turquoise tinted throat. Both sexes have violet blue untertail-coverts and a straight black bill. The upperparts and the main part of the underparts are shimmering golden green in the males. Rump and uppertail-coverts are bluish green. The throat is pale violet blue and the forked tail is bluish black. The female lacks the throat patches, its plumage is less light and the belly more golden. Like all pufflegs it has striking leg-puffs of dense white downy feather tufts.
Taxonomical debate.
The turquoise-throated puffleg is a subject of a taxonomical debate, at least partially due to its status and the few known specimens. Graves (1996) assumed it could be a hybrid between "E. vestita" and an undetermined "Eriocnemis" species, while Ridgely (2001) suggested to see it as subspecies of the "E. vestita".
Distribution and status.
This hummingbird is only known by six specimens which were collected in the 19th century. Only the type specimen from 1850 has a known locality, it being from the Chillo valley, Guayllabamba plains, Ecuador, at an altitude between 2,100 and 2,300 m asl. Two skins are simply labelled "Bogotá" - a common practice in the 19th century and not necessarily directly related to the actual locality where they were taken. It has been suggested that these two "Bogotá" specimens originated from Pasto in Nariño, Colombia.
Virtually all presumed habitat at the type locality has been destroyed. Only a few remnants are left in the steep-sided stream-cuts in the arid upper Guaillabamba drainage.
After an unconfirmed sighting in 1976, there was a survey in 1980, but this was unsuccessful.

Bartolina Sisa

Bartolina Sisa (died 5 September 1782) was an Aymara woman, an indigenous heroine and the wife of Tupac Katari. Her date of birth is uncertain, some sources give it as August 24, 1753, while others give it as August 12, 1750. Together with her husband, she led an indigenous uprising against the Spanish in Bolivia at the head of an army of some 40,000 which laid siege to the city of La Paz in 1781. Katari and Sisa set up court in El Alto and their army maintained the siege for 184 days, from March to June and from August to October. Sisa was a commander of the siege, and played the crucial role following Katari's capture in April. The siege was broken by colonial troops who advanced from Lima and Buenos Aires.
Bartolina Sisa was captured and executed by the Spanish on September 5, 1782. She was hanged after being publicly humiliated in the Colonial Square (now Plaza Murillo), beaten and raped. Once dead, the Spanish cut her body into pieces, showed her head in public to intimidate the natives, and sent her limbs to be exhibited in different villages.
In her honour, the 5th of September was instituted as the "International Day of the Indigenous Women" since 1983.

Rumors (Lindsay Lohan song)

"Rumors" is a song by American recording artist Lindsay Lohan, taken from her debut studio album, "Speak" (2004). Originally titled "Just What It Is", the song was written and produced by Cory Rooney, while additional writing was done by Lohan, Taryll Jackson, and TJ Jackson. It was released as the lead single from the album on September 21, 2004, through Casablanca Records. The dance song draws influences from electropop and teen pop, while its lyrics allude to the constant paparazzi and media backlash regarding Lohan. Music critics reviews were mixed; with statements like "infectious" or "unnecessary".
"Rumors" achieved moderate commercial success worldwide, reaching top thirty positions in Australia, Austria, Germany and Switzerland. In the United States, the song peaked at number six on "Billboard"s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, but was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping over 500,000 units of the single. The music video directed by Jake Nava featured Lohan attending a club, playing around with the paparazzi. The video was nominated for Best Pop Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and reached the top position on MTV's "Total Request Live". In 2014 Billboard ranked the song in its "Top 50 Forgotten Gems From the Now! Series", which list songs from the series that were underrated at the time of their release.
Background and composition.
"Rumors" was originally titled "Just What It Is". The track was written by Lohan, Cory Rooney, Taryll Jackson, and TJ Jackson. It was also produced by Rooney, who provided keyboards and background vocals. Peter Wade Keusch assisted the production, and was responsible along with Chris Avedon for Lohan's vocal recording, which occurred at the Poolhouse West and The Village Recorder in Los Angeles, California. Audio mixing was done by Keusch at Sony Music Studios in New York, New York. Christopher J. Warner provided the guitar present in the song's composition. It was released as a single on September 21, 2004, through Casablanca Records. "Rumors" is a dance song that draws influences from electropop and teen pop, and features a heavy R&B bassline. Lyrically, the song was written as a response to the paparazzi and media's backlash, both which are addressed in the chorus lines, where Lohan sings, "I'm tired of rumors starting/ I'm sick of being followed/ I'm tired of people lying/ Saying what they want about me/ Why can't they back off me?/ Why can't they let me live? I'm going to do it my way/ Take this for just what it is." Spence D. of IGN noted that the singer's vocals are "driven by snarls, breathy croons, and emotionally restrained angst," while John Murphy of musicOMH considered it a "a feisty dance anthem with intelligent lyrics attacking the paparazzi and press in general."
Reception.
Critical response.
"Rumors" received generally mixed reviews from music critics, however it has become one of Lohan's most recognized songs and has now been labeled as "cult pop treasure". Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine thought that "Rumors" was not a good choice for a single, stating, "in fact, for a girl, that has been tagged as America’s next sweetheart by some media outlets, it might be the worst choice of subject matter for the opening statement from a girl that automatically has more to prove to audiences because of her stature as an actress. Unfortunately, 'Rumors' is about as good as it gets." Erik Missio of "ChartAttack" thought that the song "presented potential for a semi-palatable debut effort", but further added that it is a "crap of a spectularly unspectacular level." AOL Radio reviewer Matthew Wilkening ranked "Rumors" at number 67 on a list of the 100 Worst Songs Ever, stating, "with all the stories buzzing around now, this song can almost be seen as prophetic. Oh, wait... "pa"-thetic." "Entertainment Weekly" contributor Nicholas Fonseca, however, considered "Rumors" a guilty pleasure, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected the song a Track Pick in the review of "Speak". IGN's Spence D. described it as "pervasively infectious, the kind of track that will no doubt keep the dance floors sweaty and steamy for a few months to come." John Murphy of musicOMH praised "Rumors" as a departure from "Speak"s soft rock genre.
Chart performance.
"Rumors" achieved moderate commercial success worldwide. In the United States, the song peaked at number six on "Billboard"s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, and reached number 23 on the Pop Songs component chart. However, it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in February 2005 for shipping over 500,000 copies of the single. In Australia, "Rumors" debuted at number 19 on the ARIA charts, peaking at number 10 six weeks later, while being certified Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The song also attained top thirty positions in Austria and Switzerland, and reached the top forty in Netherlands and Sweden. In Germany, the song debuted and peaked at number 14.
Promotion.
Music video.
Casablanca Records commissioned a music video to be directed by Jake Nava, who previously worked in the same year with Britney Spears on her music video for "My Prerogative" (2004). The music video for "Rumors" premiered on October 14, 2004 through MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes to a stop, and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back at him. In the next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She takes a seat next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage in the middle of the club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.
Critical response.
The music video for "Rumors" received very positive reviews from critics and viewers which eventually lead to the video reaching the top position on the countdown of "Total Request Live" in the week of October 27, 2004, and was nominated on the category Best Pop Video during the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.
Live performance.
Lohan performed "Rumors" on "Good Morning America" on December 2004. According to a MTV News staff report, "Lohan missed the cue to mouth along, forcing cameras to cut away when her mouth remained closed as she was heard singing, thanks to a backing track." A representative for Lohan, however, revealed that the singer actually sang it live, and noted that Lohan only used a background track "to help make the song sound like it does on her album."

Middle Ages and early modern times.
The first owners of the village and castle of Schelklingen were free lords of Schelklingen, probably related to the lords of Steußlingen, Justingen, etc. In 1127, three brothers, called "of Schelklingen", donated property to the monastery of "Urspring". Approximately in 1200 by the way of purchase, marriage or inheritance the territory of Schelklingen was acquired by the "Counts of Berg" ("Grafen von Berg") which later adopted the name "Counts of Berg-Schelklingen" ("Grafen von Berg-Schelklingen"). For the first time in 1234, Schelklingen is called "town" ("civitas", municipal law). In 1343, the last Count of Berg-Schelklingen sold the territory of Schelklingen to the "Dukes of Austria" and received it back as fief. When the last Count of Berg-Schelklingen died in 1346, the territory of Schelklingen went to the Dukes of Austria.
Schelklingen was later administered by Further Austria ("Vorderösterreich") and remained Austrian until 1806. The Peace of Pressburg ("Frieden von Pressburg") of 1805 brought Schelklingen to the Grand-Duchy of Württemberg as reward for the military help given to Napoleon by Württemberg.
The permanent shortage of money on the side of the Dukes of Austria and the high prestige connected with an own dominion on the side of the landed gentry were the reasons why the territory of Schelklingen (together with Ehingen and Berg) most the time was mortgaged and given away as a fief. While during the period from 1346 to the end of the 15th century the masters of the mortgage changed fast, the situation became more stable afterwards. Up to 1568 the territories of Ehingen, Schelklingen and Berg were possessed by the following persons respectively families:
In 1568, the town of Ehingen was able to free herself from a new mortgage, while paying a large sum of money to the Austrian rulers residing in Innsbruck. This way, the direct aristocratic rule ended, and the territories of Ehingen, Schelklingen and Berg in future were administered by Austrian governors, most the time noblemen. In 1680 the Count of the Empire ("Reichsgraf") and bishop of Eichstätt Marquard Schenk von Castell reminded the German Emperor of his merits and services. Thus, thanks to his efforts, the family Schenk von Castell first received the territories of Schelklingen and Berg (without Ehingen) first as a mortgage and finally in 1732 as a personal fief. The feudal rule of this family over Schelklingen and Berg lasted until the middle of the 19th century when the last obligations were abolished. "Franz Ludwig Schenk von Castell" (1736–1821), a prosecutor of criminals, was the most influential owner of the two territories during the 18th century. 
In 1806, Schelkingen was acquired by Württemberg, and the King of Württemberg was busy to end feudal rule in his new Kingdom. Mediatization ended the rule of the Schenk von Castell family in Schelklingen, and the counts step-by-step sold their properties there.
19th and 20th century.
During the 19th century Schelklingen evolved from a town of artisans and peasants towards an industrial town. In 1806 the monastery of Urspring was secularized. High costs of maintaining the many buildings finally caused Württemberg to sell the former monastery. In 1832 most of the buildings were bought by the cotton manufacturer Georg Reichenbach with the intention to build up a cotton weaving factory. This factory later adopted the name of Mechanical Weaving Factory Urspring ("Mechanische Weberei Urspring, MWU"). In 1907, the factory was transferred to Schelklingen into a new building along the Ehingerstraße. In Urspring, most of the factory buildings were removed. Caused by international competition from low-wage countries, the MWU in the 1950s got financial problems and was closed.
In Urspring in 1912, after the grain mill ("Dreikönigsmühle") at the Ach spring ("Achtopf") was changed into the municipal electricity and water factory, a new grain mill was built which is today used as a school building. From 1907 to 1930 the buildings in Urspring were not inhabited except for a tavern. Only in 1930 the former monastery found a new utilization by the foundation of the Urspring School ("Urspringschule"), a Protestant country boarding school and gymnasium.
A second industry branch which developed during the 1830s, was the production of matches. This innovation was based on the invention of the phosphor match. Three factories were founded employing many women and children in home work. These factories were closed at the beginning of the 20th century.
During the late 19th century in the valleys of the rivers Blau, Ach and Schmiech evolved the cement industry, based on the invention of the Portland cement. In 1889, the first "Barbey" factory was built, later called "Hammerstein" cement factory, and shortly after 1900 the large plant of the "Stuttgarter Immobilien- und Baugeschäft". The Hammerstein factory was closed and changed into dwellings for cement workers. This new factory attracted many external workers, especially also many Italian migrant workers: some of them remained in Schelklingen. Later, this cement factory was bought by the "Portland-Cement-Fabrik AG Heidelberg und Mannheim AG", today HeidelbergCement.
During the 1870s a Catholic institution for boys living in bad social conditions ("Katholische Rettungsanstalt für Knaben") was founded, the St.-Konradihaus. In 1941 the St.-Konradihaus was requisitioned by the government and until 1945 was used as a relocation camp ("Umsiedlungslager" ("SS-Lager")) in order to reeducate people from Alsace.
Territorial evolution of the city.
According to the administrative reorganization of the municipalities ("Gemeindegebietsreform in Baden-Württemberg") the following communes have been incorporated into (or merged with) the city of Schelklingen:
Religions.
Schelklingen is predominantly Catholic: this is caused by historical reasons. The territory of the former dominion of Schelklingen ("Herrschaft Schelklingen"), conististing of the city of Schelklingen, Hausen ob Urspring and Schmiechen and the territory of the former Urspring monastery until 1806 belonged to Further Austria ("Vorderösterreich"). During the 16th century until the end of the 30 Years War, the villages of the former territory of Justingen ("Reichsherrschaft Justingen", Justingen, Ingstetten, Gundershofen and Hütten) adhered to the belief of Caspar Schwenckfeld, promoted by the lords of Freyberg ("Freiherren von Freyberg"). When the territory of Justingen was newly acquired again by the prince bishop ("Fürstbischof") of Augsburg "Johann Christoph von Freyberg" (1665–1690), Catholicism was reintroduced. The village of Sondernach was part of the territory of Neusteußlingen; under the rule of the lords of Freyberg residing in the castle Neusteußlingen (not identical with the former, but related) it was Catholic. When this territory went back to the Dukes of Württemberg in the late 16th century, the "Reformation" was introduced there.
In Schelklingen at the moment exist each one Roman Catholic ("Römisch-Katholische Kirche"), Lutheran Protestant ("Evangelische Kirche") and New-Apostolic ("Neuapostolische Kirche") community. In addition, Muslim inhabitants are living in Schelklingen. Most of them are members of the Sunnite Islam. The Islamic citizens came to Schelklingen since the early 1960s by the way of labour migration, mainly from the Republic of Turkey. Some years ago, the Muslim inhabitants built a small mosque ("Gebetsstätte") at the outskirts of the town.
Politics.
Mayors.
During Austrian times the city was administered by the governing official mayor ("regierender Amtsbürgermeister") and his predecssor, the lower mayor ("Unterbürgermeister"). These were supported by an internal and external council ("innerer und äußerer Rat") with four members each, called councilors or deputies ("Ratsherren, Deputierte"). The city offices like city, church, and hospital accountancy, etc. ("Stadtrechner, Kirchenpfleger, Spitalpfleger") were distributed among the councilors. The mayors were elected for one year, but reelections were possible, proved by the mayors' partly long years in office. After 1806 Württemberg introduced the position of the "Schultheiß", elected for life. Later for towns the title "Stadtschultheiß" was introduced. In 1930 in Württemberg the title "Bürgermeister" (mayor) was adopted which is used until the present day. The mayor is currently elected for a term of eight years.
Municipal council.
As of the municipal election of 2009, the following was the distribution of seats on the town council:
Coat of arms.
The coat of arms of the city of Schelklingen is the coat of arms of the former "Counts of Berg-Schelklingen" except that the red and white strips are organized in the opposite way. They are not running from left to right (coat of arms of the city of "Ehingen"), but from the right upper side to the lower left side. The city colours are white and red.
Economy and infrastructure.
Traffic.
Schelklingen is a small regional railway knot. At this place the Danube Valley Railway ("Donautalbahn") from Ulm to Donaueschingen meets the Swabian Alb Railway which is coming from Kleinengstingen over Münsingen to Schelklingen. While traffic on the Schwäbische Albbahn ist quite low, departures and arrivals are frequent on the Donautalbahn. Schelklingen is a stop both for regional express trains and both for regional trains. Therefore at least two trains per hour are leaving for Ulm. Into the opposite direction for Sigmaringen, a train is leaving every hour; and trains are leaving every two hours for the much more remote city of Titisee-Neustadt. Every hour, via Ulm station, regional trains are leaving for Memmingen. The city of Schelklingen is member of the Donau-Iller regional traffic network Donau-Iller-Nahverkehrsverbund.
Schelklingen is related to the supraregional road net via the Federal Road 492 (Bundesstraße 492) (Blaubeuren–Ehingen). Schelklingen has access to the Federal motorway system via the Federal Motorway A 8 (A 8) – exit Merklingen respectively Federal Motorway A 7 (A 7) – exit Ulm/Langenau.
Local enterprises.
Larger plants of the "HeidelbergCement AG" and "Cooper Standard Automotive" are located in the city.
Education.
Schelklingen has an elementary school ("Grundschule"), an extended elementary school ("Hauptschule") with a practical secondary school ("Werkrealschule"), all included in the "Heinrich-Kaim-school", as well as four additional elementary schools in the parts of the town, all supervised by the municipality.
In addition, the Urspring School ("Urspringschule") offers high school studies ("Gymnasium") accompanied by a boarding school, under the supervision of the Protestant Church. In addition to the "Abitur", practical studies can be finished as well.
The St. Konradihaus is an institution for youth assistance with a boarding school, where young people from the age of 12 years onwards may obtain general schooling and occupational education.
Furthermore, four Roman Catholic, two municipal and one Protestant kindergarten exist in the town.
Culture and things to see.
Library.
The municipal public library is located in the "Old Townhall". Its holdings are stored in an online library catalogue.
Theatres.
A theatre club exists, presenting popular performances. There is no theatre in the strict sense of the word any more.
Culinaric specialties.
Typical Swabian dishes (like Spätzle, Maultaschen, Saure Kutteln, Sauerbraten, etc.) are served by different restaurants and taverns.
Personalities.
Honorary citizens.
The city of Schelklingen has awarded the rights of honorary citizenship to the following persons:
Sons and daughters of the town.
The following list contains important personalities, born in Schelklingen, arranged by year of birth. Persons are included in this list irrelevant of the fact if they lived and worked in Schelklingen later in their life or not.

Contemporary classical guitar

This article details Contemporary classical guitar instruments, technique, and repertoire.
Instrument.
Modern concert guitars often, but by no means always, follow the Smallman design which replaces the spruce fan braces with a much lighter carbon fibre/balsa composite structure. The braces form a lattice pattern which allows the (now much thinner) sound board to support more vibrational modes. This leads to greater volume and longer sustain.

Irl Tubbs

Ira "Irl" Tubbs (February 12, 1887 – February 9, 1970) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at the University of Wisconsin–Superior (1923–1925, 1928–1929), the University of Miami (1935–1936), and the University of Iowa (1937–1938).
Playing and coaching career.
Tubbs played college football at William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri. He was a quarterback and end for William Jewell in the late 1910s.
After graduation, Tubbs coached for two years in Missouri high schools before taking a coaching job at the University of Wisconsin–Superior. He was in Wisconsin for nine years from 1922 to 1930, although he was only able to coach for five seasons due to attacks of Malta fever.
At Wisconsin–Superior, Tubbs served as both athletic director and a coach of football and hockey. He coached from 1923 to 1925 and again in 1928 and 1929, leading his school to football championships his last two seasons. Tubbs was a renowned inventor, developing improvements to athletic equipment such as a special inverted air valve for a football and elastic padding for football pants.
Tubbs resigned from Wisconsin–Superior in 1930 after another bout of health problems and moved to Miami, Florida. While he was recovering there in 1935, the head football coaching job at the University of Miami opened, and Tubbs was hired to coach the Hurricanes. Tubbs coached the Hurricanes for two seasons in 1935 and 1936, where he compiled an 11–5–2 record. In both seasons, his Hurricane teams bowed out as potential hosts for New Year's Day bowl games.
Tubbs was then hired as the 14th head football coach at the University of Iowa. He coached two seasons at Iowa in 1937 and 1938. He had a record of just 2–13–1 at Iowa, with his wins coming over Bradley and Chicago. Tubbs' tenure at Iowa is best distinguished by his coaching of players who would star for Iowa's 1939 team, nicknamed the "Ironmen". Some of the players Tubbs coached included Nile Kinnick, an all-Big Ten Conference selection in 1937, and Erwin Prasse, an all-conference end in 1938.
Tubbs was inducted into the University of Wisconsin–Superior Athletics Hall of Fame in 1963.

Scheßlitz

Scheßlitz (or Schesslitz) is a town in the Upper Franconian district of Bamberg and lies on the rise to the Franconian Switzerland on the A 70 between Bamberg and Bayreuth, lying 14 km northeast of the former.
Geography.
The town is surrounded by the following hills:
This basin’s sheltered setting with roads that come together from Heiligenstadt, Hollfeld, Weismain, Bad Staffelstein and Zapfendorf favoured settlement in prehistoric times.
Constituent communities.
Scheßlitz’s main town and namesake centre is by far the biggest of its "Ortsteile" with a population of 2,548. The town furthermore has these outlying centres, each given here with its own population figure:
The amalgamation of these "Stadtteile" into Scheßlitz on 1 May 1972 and 1 May 1978 made the town the district's biggest municipality by land area.
History.
Scheßlitz had its first documentary mention about 805. Scheßlitz is among the area’s oldest settlements and has held town rights since 1230.
Linear Pottery remains in the "Kohlstatt" (“cabbage place”) make clear that there were settlers here as long ago as 2500 BC.
Concrete clues as to the town’s history are yielded by the "Codex Eberhardi" in which it is documented that a Count Bernhard and his wife Ratbirg bequeathed their property on what is now Scheßlitz’s abutting rural area to the Fulda Monastery about the year 800. The town has seized on this event as its historical beginnings and thus celebrated its 1,200-year jubilee in 2005.
It is said that confirmation of the existence of a parish of Scheßlitz is the underwriting of a protocol about the Bamberg Synod in 1059 by Arnold de Sieslice.
The town gained importance through the Andechs Meranians’ activities, who rose to dukes in 1178. In 1230, one of Duke Otto VIII’s fortified Andechs Meranian castles in the "civitas" of Scheßlitz was mentioned, making Scheßlitz the Bamberg district’s oldest town.
The town of Scheßlitz was an "Obervogtamt" (“higher reeve’s office”) of the High Monastery of Bamberg, and with the "Reichsdeputationshauptschluss" of 1803, it became part of Bavaria.
Entry in a travel guide.
In his travel guide about Bamberg and the surrounding area from about 1912, the compiler Dietrich Amende also describes the town of Scheßlitz:
Amalgamations.
In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, many nearby communities were amalgamated with the town, thereby giving the town the greatest land area of any municipality in the district. The amalgamations are listed here by date.
Politics.
Town council.
The town council is made up of 20 members:
Mayors.
Scheßlitz’s “First Mayor” is Franz Zenk (CSU), and the “Second Mayor” is Roland Kauper (CSU).
Coat of arms.
Scheßlitz’s arms might heraldically be described thus: A wall embattled argent, the chief party per pale Or a lion rampant sable armed and langued gules surmounted by a bendlet of the first and argent a fishhook reversed of the fourth.
The lion recalls the Bamberg High Monastery. The fishhook comes from Bamberg Bishop Lamprecht von Brunn’s family coat of arms. The wall stands for the town’s fortification.
Economy and infrastructure.
After the Second World War, various firms settled in Scheßlitz:
Within the town’s limits are five breweries, of which the Schmitt, Senger and Drei Kronen breweries are in Scheßlitz itself. In Köttensdorf is found the Hoh Brewery and in Würgau the Hartmann Brewery. By 2008 at the latest, for the 700th anniversary, the Drei Kronen Brewery in Straßgiech will also be brewing again. Until the 1990s, the Ellertal Brewery was still brewing its own beer.
All together, Scheßlitz offers about 2,000 jobs.
Transport.
A planned train connection between Scheßlitz and Hollfeld was once again put off in 1906 after widespread groundwork had already been done because both places wanted the project to fail for political reasons. The reason, however, was not the high building cost (2 million Marks), but rather that both towns were seeking the lucrative status of being the last station on the line.
Four of the variations on the plan for a railway line on the Franconian Jura that were discussed were as follows:
The line envisaged by the planners would have run from Scheßlitz towards Würgau, and then climbed left at the Schlappenreuther Berg in the Jura. The line would then have stretched through Gräfenhäusling to Steinfeld, in the end reaching the town of Hollfeld through the Wiesent and Aufseß Valleys.
Near Demmelsdorf a forest aisle was already being cut and a new canal harbour was being discussed to afford ore shipping from the Jura Mountains.
In 1918, there were once more stirrings aimed at getting the "Jurabahn" railway built. In 1920, however, the Transport Ministry ("Reichsverkehrsministerium") made it known that in view of the bad state of the economy, any new railway building projects would have to be abandoned for the time being. Eventually, in 1930, a postal busline from Bamberg by way of Scheßlitz and Hollfeld to Bayreuth was opened.

WKZV

WKZV was a 1,000 watt, two-tower directional, daytime-only AM radio station in the Pittsburgh radio market, licensed to Washington, Pennsylvania. On May 16, 2013, the station went dark, and returned its license to the FCC, after ending its country music format of more than two decades.
History.
The WKEG Years.
Known then as WKEG, the station was first issued a construction permit in August 1968, signing on October 1, 1970. Among the station's original staff at start-up was general manager Lew Wade, vice president Leo Shank, and chief engineer Richard Canter.
WKEG featured a full-service format of middle-of-the-road, country, and polka music. The polka show was hosted by local polka musician Gil Yurus, who joined the station at start-up and remained until financial troubles began in the late 1980s. 
WKEG maintained its original owner until September 1972, when DiLeLo Broadcasting sold the station to Nascone Enterprises (dba Genas Broadcasting), a company headed by Joseph P. Nascone, the former sales manager of WTAE Radio in Pittsburgh. 
Upon acquisition, Joe Nascone changed the station's format to easy listening. Genas Broadcasting operated the station until 1987 when it was purchased by Ferguson Broadcasting. 
For many of its early years, the station operated out of a trailer at its transmitter site on McLane Road (now Whitetail Drive) in Chartiers Township, north of downtown Washington, and then to the former George Washington Hotel in downtown Washington.
The station would move in the late 1980s to another studio location at 71 North Main Street in downtown Washington, following its purchase by Ferguson Broadcasting, and then to its current location on East Chestnut Street in 1990. 
The third owner, William Ferguson, changed the station's format to adult contemporary, delivered via satellite through the Transtar Radio Network. The station ended up going dark in two years. 
The station was then purchased by JJG Communications, a company headed by Carmichaels businessman John G. Brodak and John Loeper, the former general manager of WANB/WANB-FM in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania. 
JJG made another go of the station, this time with a news/talk/sports format, also mostly via satellite. The station failed again, and was off the air by October 1991. 
Rebirth as WKZV.
The station returned to the air in the spring of 1992, this time with a new set of call letters; WKZV ("KZ Country") and a new owner, U.S. North Broadcasting, Inc. 
Despite their best efforts and investment in studio overhauls, the station did not prosper. A little over a year later Helen Supinski bought the station from U.S. North Broadcasting, Inc. in March 1993, and continued to do business until May 2013 as My-Key Broadcasting.. Polka disc-jockey Mike Panjuscek served as station manager.
The new owner discontinued satellite-delivered country music format in May 1995 and hired two local announcers, Jeff Martin and Randy Allum, each working half of the broadcast day. Martin was the station's program director and Allum was music director. Jeff Gorman was the news director and Melissa Anderson worked weekends. Panjuscek gradually shifted the format to more of a classic country sound, with special emphasis on local country music artists and those on independent record labels, especially on weekends when Panjuscek did a Saturday afternoon show made up of bluegrass, classic country, and local artists. On Sunday afternoons Panjuscek, as "Polka Mike," did a show exclusively featuring polka music. 
Cease of operations.
Panjuscek died on September 17, 2011. 
The station owner, Helen Supinski, closed the station at the end of the day on Tuesday, May 14, 2013. 
In a letter to the FCC dated that day, WKZV's communications attorneys cited health reasons and adverse economic conditions as reasons to surrender the license. The FCC cancelled the station's license on May 21, 2013.
Helen Supinski died April 26, 2014 at the age of 90.

Polyvinylidene chloride

Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) is a homopolymer of vinylidene chloride.
History.
Ralph Wiley accidentally discovered polyvinylidene chloride in 1933. He, then, was a college student who worked part-time at Dow Chemical lab as a dishwasher. While cleaning laboratory glassware, he came across a vial he could not scrub clean. Dow researchers made this material into a greasy, dark green film, first called "Eonite" and then "Saran".
Ralph Wiley went on to become one of Dow Chemical's Research Scientists and invent and develop many plastics, chemicals and production machines.
The military sprayed Saran on fighter planes to guard against salty sea spray and carmakers used it for upholstery. Dow later devised a formulation of polyvinylidene chloride free of unpleasant odour and green colour.
The most well known use of polyvinylidene chloride came in 1953, when Saran Wrap, a plastic food wrap was introduced. In 2004, however, the formula was changed to low density polyethylene due to environmental concerns about its chlorine content.

It is a remarkable barrier against water, oxygen and aromas. It has a superior chemical resistance to alkalies and acids, is insoluble in oil and organic solvents, has very low moisture regain and is impervious to mold, bacteria, and insects. But it is soluble in polar solvents.
It has good thermal stability, but above 125 °C decomposes to produce HCl.
Fiber types.
Saran fiber comes in monofilament, multifilament-twist, and as a staple fiber. It is also available in thermochromic (color changing) and luminescent (glow in the dark) fibers.
Uses.
Packaging.
Polyvinylidene chloride is applied as a water-based coating to other plastic films such as biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). This coating increases the barrier properties of the film, reducing the permeability of the film to oxygen and flavours and thus extending the shelf life of the food inside the package. It can also impart a high gloss finish which may be aesthetically pleasing and also provides a high degree of scuff resistance to if applied over print.
Household.
Cleaning cloths, filters, screens, tape, shower curtains, garden furniture.
Industry.
Screens, artificial turf, waste-water treatment materials, underground materials.
Miscellaneous.
Doll hair, stuffed animals, fabrics, fishnet, pyrotechnics, shoe insoles.
Disadvantages.
While extremely useful as a food packaging agent, the major disadvantage of polyvinylidene chloride is that it will undergo thermally induced dehydrochlorination at temperatures very near to processing temperatures. This degradation easily propagates, leaving polyene sequences long enough to absorb visible light, and change the color of the material from colorless to an undesirable transparent brown (unacceptable for one of polyvinylidene chloride chief applications: food packaging). Therefore, there is a significant amount of product loss in the manufacturing process, which increases production and consumer costs.
Trademarks (producers).
Saran TC and Saran LS (Asahi-Kasei), Saran Wrap and Saranex (Dow Chemical), Ixan and Diofan (SolVin).

Ardisia

Ardisia (coralberry or marlberry) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It was in the former Myrsinaceae family now recognised as the myrsine sub-family Myrsinoideae. They are distributed in the Americas, Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, mainly in the tropics. There are 400 to 500 species.
These are trees, shrubs, and subshrubs. Most have alternately arranged leaves. Flowers are borne in many forms of inflorescence. The flowers have usually 4 or 5 green sepals and a bell-shaped corolla of usually 4 or 5 white or pink petals. The fruit is a somewhat fleshy drupe. The defining characteristic of the genus is the small tube formed at the center of the flower by the stamens, which are joined at their bases.
One species, "Ardisia japonica" (Chinese: 紫金牛; pinyin: zǐjīn niú) is one of the 50 fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine.

Schiltach

Schiltach is a town in the district of Rottweil, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated in the eastern Black Forest, on the river Kinzig, 20 km south of Freudenstadt.
Geography.
Schiltach lies in the eastern end of the Black Forest, at the confluence of the Schiltach and Kinzig rivers. It stands at an elevation of 330 metres (1,083 ft).
Climate.
Like most of Germany, Schiltach has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification "Cfb").
Town subdivisions.
The town of Schiltach consists of the districts Schiltach and Lehengericht. The two districts are geographically identical to the previously independent municipalities of the same name. 
The district Schiltach includes the city of Schiltach, the villages Grumpenbächle and Vorderheubach and the settlements Auf der Staig, Blattenhäuserwiese, Grumpen and Kuhbacherhof (Vor Kuhbach). The ruined castle Willenburg is located in the district of Schiltach. 
The village Lehengericht has its own village council, a mayor as its chairman and its own village administration. The district Lehengericht also consists of the settlements and hamlets Herdweg, Auf dem Hof, Schmelzle, Vor dem unteren Erdlinsbach, Vor Reichenbächle, Welschdorf, Höllgraben, Im Eulersbach, Im hinteren Erdlinsbach, Kienbronn, Rohrbach, Rubstock, Deisenbauernhof and several isolated farms. 
<br clear=left>
History.
The road through the Kinzigtal was already in the Roman Empire a connection through the Black Forest out of the area of Strasbourg in the direction to Rottweil.
Schiltach was founded in the 11th century as a parish for the surrounding farms, which are older than Schiltach. Around the town church, which today stands in the town district "Vorstädtle" and is evangelic, rose a settlement named after the river Schiltach. Probably in the middle of the 13th century the Dukes of Teck founded the town Schiltach to secure their territories. They build a town surrounding wall with gates and above the town a castle. A church was not built, because Schiltach already had one.
The town should host transients and be a service center before the gradient of the road to Rottweil. Since about 1250 the castle and town took over the function of the Willenburg, which supplied the road before the founding of Schiltach.
In 1371 Schiltach got in the hands of the Dukes of Urslingen. After ten years, the impoverished dukes of Ursling sold the castle and town to the Dukes of Württemberg. Until 1810 Württemberg held Schiltach except the years from 1519 to 1534. At first Schiltach was sieged by the Reichsstadt Rottweil and later (like the whole Duchy of Württemberg) by Further Austria.
In the ""Gränzvertrag zwischen dem Königreich Württemberg und dem Großherzogthum Baden"" (border treaty between the Kingdom of Württemberg and Grand Duchy of Baden), which was negotiated in Paris on October 2, 1810, several areas of the "Oberamt Hornberg", besides Schiltach also the town of Hornberg and the communities Gutach and Kirnbach, got to the Grand Duchy of Baden. Wolfach became the new "Amststadt" of Schiltach and later the county town. The surrounding farm became as Lehengericht, an own community.
In 1952, Schiltach went to the state Baden-Württemberg. The Landkreis Wolfach was dissolved in 1973, Schiltach was allocated to Rottweil. The community Lehengericht was reincorporated into the town of Schiltach in 1974. In 1979 the exclave Sulzbächle/Fischbach went to the town of Wolfach, in return the area "Vor Heubach" got to Schiltach.
Religions.
During the Protestant Reformation, Schiltach was a part of Württemberg so it was like the territorial lords evangelic. It did not change until the 19th century, when because of industrialisation more and more Catholics moved in. Today in Schiltach exist an evangelic and a catholic community beside a new apostolic community and various minor religious communities.
Emblem.
Today's town emblem was adopted of the Dukes of Urslingen. The emblem became free to use as the last Urlinger, Duke Reinhold IV. of Urslingen died in 1442. Probably it was conveyed by the Count Ludwig of Württemberg, which was a patron of the town.
The emblem shows three red shields in a white field. Almost the same emblem can be found in Alsace at the house of the Rappolstein, which castle stands above Ribeauvillé. A member of the Ursling family married into Rappolstein family.
Politics.
Local council.
The local council has besides the mayor 14 members, including three women. The local election took place on 7 June 2009 and had following results:
The town district Lehengericht has a "Ortsschaftsrat" with eight members.
Twin town.
Schiltach holds a partnership with Geising in Saxony.
Economy and infrastructure.
Industry.
Despite its rural location the town possesses an industrial base with several internationally-known companies. Already in the time of Industrialization there were industrial areas. Schiltach had several cloth mills, which took advantage of the soft water from the two rivers; also there were multiple saw mills and tanneries for the same reason. Until the Kinzigtalbahn was built there was a timber rafting, which had to close because of the railroad. The wood from Schiltach and surroundings was partly shipped to the Netherlands on the Rhine, where it was used for ship building. Today these branches of industries have vanished except for the famous tannery "Trautwein" and some small saw mills. The earlier privileged timber rafting is kept alive by an active raftergroup to keep the once important industry of Schiltach in mind.
There are still some companies which were established at the turn of the century like Hansgrohe (1901), and (BBS, VEGA Grieshaber KG etc.) established later.
The industry of Schiltach provides roughly 3350 local employments, which is extraordinary because Schiltach has only roughly 4000 citizens. Also the Schiltach is topographically disadvantaged because it is in the narrowest place in the Kinzigtal and the motorways Autobahn 81 and Autobahn 5 are far away. So much the more the city fathers are more grateful for the local companies to stay at Schiltach and are willing to support the companies.
Education.
The town of Schiltach has one elementary school and a Hauptschule ("Nachbarschaftsschule Schiltach/Schenkenzell") with Werkrealschule. Secondary Schools are in the surrounding towns, e.g. in Schramberg, Wolfach and Hausach. There also is an evangelic and catholic kindergarten, a "Waldorfkindergarten" and a private day care center. The Folk High School Schiltach/Schinkenzell is an outpost of the Folk High School Schramberg.
Infrastructure.
Schiltach is connected with the Bundesstraßen 294 and 462, which close the gap between Rhine and Neckar, thus also the gap between the motorways A 81 and A 5. Schiltach is traffic-calmed by a bypass. The "Bundesstraße 294" directs through the 1830 m long "Kirchbergtunnel and the 830 m long "Schloßbergtunnel" through which also the "Bundesstraße 462" directs.
On workdays you can reach Freudenstadt and Offenburg with the Kinzigtalbahn every hour. At weekends single trains drive via Offenburg to Strasbourg. Besides the actual train station Schiltach has another station closer to the town centrum where all passenger trains of a private railway company stop. The Schiltach-Schramberg railway opened in 1892 was closed in 1959 for passenger trains and 1989 for cargo trains, too. Meanwhile the tracks were removed. The route is now a cycle route from Schiltach to Schramberg. Furthermore there is a very recommendable cycle route through the whole Kinzig valley from Haslach to Alpirsbach. Various bus connections in direction of Offenburg and Freudenstadt as well as a strong connection via bus to the county town Rottweil complete the traffic. There is also a handicapped accessible bus which drives almost drives to all town districts at regular intervals.
Notable places.
The whole medieval inner city is under monument protection. The marketplace includes the town hall, which was designed by architect Heinrich Schickhardt and built during the Kingdom of Württemberg. There are many half-timber houses scattered throughout the town that date back to anywhere between the 16th and 19th centuries. Schiltach is part of the German Half-Timbered House Road tourist route.
A long-distance walking trail known as the Mittelweg spans the Black Forest from north to south (between Pforzheim and Waldshut), and passes through Schiltach as one stage of the trail.
The Silvesterzug is a procession that takes place in Schiltach on New Year's Eve. As part of an old tradition, the citizens walk through the streets with lanterns from the marketplace to the town church and sing hymms of Pietistic origins. During the procession, the street lights of the city are turned off and replaced with pitch torches; the only electric lights to be seen are those of Christmas trees shone through the windows of private households. The local pastor gives a speech from the window of the town rectory, accompanied by the performance of a choir and trombone ensemble. Afterwards, the citizens gather at the town hall, where the mayor also gives a speech.
Regular events.
Schiltach holds several markets over the year, e.g. a farmer's market on the third Sunday in October or an artisans' market on the last Sunday in April. Besides the "Schiltacher Advent" and the "Silvesterzug" every year Fastnacht is celebrated at the time of Fasching.

Schirgiswalde

Schirgiswalde (in Sorbian "Šěrachów") is a town and a former municipality in the district of Bautzen in Saxony in Germany. Since 1 January 2011, it is part of the town Schirgiswalde-Kirschau. It is located on the river Spree, 15 km south of Bautzen. The small town is an official place of relaxation (staatlich anerkannter Erholungsort). Together with the villages of Crostau and Kirschau it is representing the administrative community of Schirgiswalde. some smaller parts of the town are "Neuschirgiswalde" upon a hill and "Petersbach".
History.
The village of Schirgiswalde first has been mentioned in a document from the year 1346. In the thirty years war most of the settlement was destroyed and most of its population died. To enforce the rebuilding and the economic reconstruction of the community the owner of Schirgiswalde made it a town in 1665. Later the small town became part of the land owned by the Domstift in Bautzen - it means it belonged to the church. Until the midst of the 19th century it stayed under the regime and the right of the domstift.
In 1635 the upper Lusatia became part of Saxony, but Schirgiswalde still belonged to Bohemia as a kind of an exclave. Therefore it became again catholic like whole Bohamia after the thirty years war. The situation as a kind of a bohemian island in Saxony rested until 1809 - the next 35 years the official status of the towns stayed unclear. Long diplomatic arguments between Saxony and Austria stayed without any success on either side. In 1810 the Saxon army took control of Schirgiswalde. Since then Austria has had no more political power in the city but it still regards itself as the rightful owner. An official handing over to the kingdom of Saxony also became impossible because of the restating war in 1813. It lasted until 1845 - in that year the town became officially a part of the kingdom of Saxany. The time of no political power in the town has been widely used by robbers, thieves and political refugees.
Museums and sights.
The municipal museum can be found near the main street and near the park of the town. It offers an overview over all typical handicrafts and some archaeological findings and documents concerning the history of the town. It is also possible to take a look at the old tapestry-room belonging to the old manor of the Domstift. In the big baroque catholic church upon a hill in the inner city some old figures and the Eule-orgue can be found. Like in other villages and towns of the southern upper Lusatia the typical Umgebindehäuser are some of the most important sights in Schirgiswalde too.

Coram's Fields is a large urban open space in the London borough of Camden in central London. It occupies seven acres in Bloomsbury and includes a children's playground, sand pits, a duck pond, a pets corner, café and nursery. Adults (defined as anyone over the age of 16) are only permitted to enter if accompanied by children (under 16).
It is situated on the former site of the Foundling Hospital, established by Thomas Coram in what was then named Lamb's Conduit Field in 1739. The Foundling Hospital was relocated outside London in the 1920s, and the site was earmarked for redevelopment. However, campaigning and fundraising by local residents and a donation from the Harmsworth family of newspaper proprietors, led to the creation of the current park that opened in 1936. Coram's Fields is a Grade II listed site and is owned and run by an independent registered charity, officially named Coram's Fields and the Harmsworth Memorial Playground.
Coram's Fields also offers three eight-a-side football pitches, two tennis courts, a stickball field and a basketball court.
The Thomas Coram Foundation for Children (the successor charity to the Foundling Hospital) and the Foundling Museum housing the art collections of the former Hospital, are based in buildings nearby.
To the west is Brunswick Square, and to the east is Mecklenburgh Square (bordered by Goodenough College to the south), two historical London squares. To the north is the Thomas Coram Foundation and St George's Gardens. To the south are Guilford Street and Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Heralds are people with extrasensory or psychic abilities who have devoted their lives to using their abilities to help others, specifically, the kingdom of Valdemar. A small number of Heralds have mage capabilities and are called Herald-Mages. Both sets of abilities are clearly and distinctly defined in the Valdemar universe.
Plot summary.
Vanyel Ashkevron, age sixteen, is the heir to a great estate, "Forst Reach", though he does not measure up to what his father, Lord Withen, deems to be a "proper" man. He is devoted to music and cultivating an elegant appearance. Withen sends Vanyel to school in Haven, the capital of Valdemar, under the supervision of Vanyel's aunt Savil.
Savil has little interest in Vanyel because he has no psychic or magic powers, but realizes he is not as arrogant as Withen described. Vanyel finds schooling at Haven more suited to his nature, but is told he does not have the Bardic gift, and cannot become a true Bard. Feeling he has lost his dream, he becomes depressed.
Vanyel develops feelings for Tylendel Frelennye, one of Savil's protégés. He learns that Tylendel is "shay'a'chern", or homosexual. They become lovers and later find they are lifebonded, that is, soulmates. For the first time, Vanyel is truly happy. Tylendel introduces Vanyel to Gala, his Companion; one of the intelligent horse-like creatures that bond with Heralds.
Staven, Tylendel's twin brother, is assassinated by a family enemy. Tylendel senses his brother's death and goes mad with grief. Not understanding Tylendel's trauma, Vanyel continues supporting him as he seeks revenge. Using Vanyel's dormant energies Tylendel 'Gates' (teleports essentially) them to the enemy family. Tylendel casts a complicated spell summoning deadly wyrsa to kill members of the enemy family. Gala repudiates Tylendel and dies sacrificing herself to give time for Heralds to arrive to stop the massacre. Tylendel commits suicide, and the backlash from the 'Gate' spell tears open Vanyel's dormant magic potential.
Suffering from psychic and emotional damage, Vanyel is "chosen" by a Companion, Yfandes, who reassures him of her love and friendship and his worth. Vanyel begins recovering, but is unable to control his newly "opened" powers. He telepathically overhears thoughts blaming him for Tylendel's death. Vanyel attempts suicide, but is rescued, and the Heralds see that his love for Tylendel was real.
Savil, realizing Vanyel needs special assistance, takes him to the "Tayledras," human beings who live in K'Treva, an environment immersed in magic. They teach him how to control his abilities, and convince him that being gay is not wrong or sinful. Vanyel does not want to be a Herald or a Mage, and suspects the people around him value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks things over he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.
The Tayledras, now aware that the drakes were gated in from Vanyel's experience, Savil and Vanyel set out to check on a village that was under Tayledras protection and has fallen under an enemy shield. Upon arriving at this village Vanyel is left to assist in protecting the village from minor harm and instead finds himself face to face with a Blood magic crazed wizard. In Vanyel's attempts to deflect the wizards magic he pulls on the power of a node and destroys the wizard with the raw power. He believes he will die as well, but is comforted by the thought that he will be with Tylendel. Vanyel wakes to find himself with his aunt in K'Treva as she presents him with the white robes of a full-fledged Herald-Mage.

Storeria dekayi

Storeria dekayi, commonly known as the brown snake or De Kay's snake, is a small species of colubrid snake.
Geographic range.
It is native to Southern Ontario and Quebec, most of the eastern half of the United States, through Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and possibly El Salvador.
Description.
Dorsally, it is brown to gray with a lighter center stripe bordered by small black spots; ventrally, it is lighter brown or pink with small black dots at the ends of the ventral scales. Adults usually measure less than in total length (including tail), but the record total length is . It has keeled dorsal scales, and no loreal scale.
Reproduction.
Like other natricine snakes (such as watersnakes, genus "Nerodia"; and gartersnakes, genus "Thamnophis"), "Storeria dekayi" is an ovoviviparous species.
Diet.
It eats earthworms, slugs, snails, and most other small invertebraes.
Etymology.
The specific name, "dekayi", is in honor of American zoologist James Ellsworth De Kay (1792–1851), who collected the first specimen in Long Island, New York, while the generic name, "Storeria", honors zoologist David Humphreys Storer. This is the only North American snake whose binomial is a double honorific - that is, both the generic name and the specific name honor people.

Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) is a professional association based in the UK. Its members, including people with and without medical degrees, work in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology, that is, pregnancy, childbirth, and female sexual and reproductive health. RCOG is dedicated to "improving sexual and reproductive healthcare worldwide." The College has over 12,000 members in over 100 countries, over half of these reside outside of the United Kingdom.
The college's primary object is given as "The encouragement of the study and the advancement of the science and practice of obstetrics and gynaecology", although its governing documents impose no specific restrictions on its operation. Its offices are near Regent's Park in central London.
History.
Founded as the British College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in September 1929 by Professor William Blair-Bell and Sir William Fletcher Shaw, RCOG was granted a Royal Charter on 21 March 1947. For the first three years, the office work was done from 20, St John Street, Manchester. In 1932, the office was shifted to London at 58, Queen Anne Street. The building was officially opened by the Duchess of York on December 5, 1932. With continuing expansion of the college activities, it had outgrown the Queen Anne Street premises and a decision was made in 1952 to move to larger premises. 
The college moved to the present premises at 27 Sussex Place, Regent's Park in July 1960. The new building was formally opened by Her Majesty on the 13th of July.
Core activities and responsibilities.
The College promotes standards of care in obstetrics and gynaecology by a programme of research, publication, and review. Areas of prenatal studies have included the effect of obesity of the expectant mother on frequency of birth defects. The College examines and evaluates other researchers' results, as in the 1999 claim that coffee could cause miscarriage, which they found to be unsupported, and the claimed connection between breast cancer and abortion, which RCOG also found unsupported. 
RCOG has published many informational guides and studies, including thirty on contraception, twenty-four on pregnancy complications, and five on abortion. Other topics covered include cancer, breastfeeding, diabetes in pregnancy, and neonatology (resuscitation of the newborn, in which skill RCOG recommends that all professionals present at the time of birth are proficient). In addition, the College publishes books ranging from biographies of significant people in the profession, to textbooks for trainees, to results of research.
Examinations.
The RCOG is responsible for developing the framework and curriculum of post graduate training in obsteterics and gynaecology in the United Kingdom. It conducts two principal examinations: the Membership examination (MRCOG) and the Diploma examination (DRCOG). The DRCOG examination is aimed at doctors, and especially General Practitioners, who wish to certificate their knowledge and interest in obsteterics and gynaecology. 
The Membership examination, which were first held in 1931, is intended for those who wish to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology. The exam is a two-part examination, the Part 1 MRCOG is a written examination to evaluate basic and clinical sciences relevant to the subject and the Part 2 consists of separate written and clinical sections (OSCEs).
Members and Fellows.
Members use the designatory letters MRCOG. Membership is awarded at a meeting of Council to those who have passed all parts of the Membership examination.
The award of the Fellowship is a mark of senior status and does not indicate completion of training. They are elected from the those who have been Members for at least 12 years. Fellows use the designatory letters FRCOG. Fellowship can also be awarded to those who are not been Members of the college, but have either contributed significantly to the advancement of the specialty (Fellows ad eundem); demonstrated exemplary work in the specialty (Fellows honoris causa) or distinguished people outside the medical profession (Honorary Fellows).
Journals.
BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology
BJOG is an editorially independent peer reviewed journal owned by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists publishing work in all areas of obstetrics and gynaecology, including contraception, urogynaecology, fertility, oncology and clinical practice. It is one of the most widely read journals in obstetrics and gynaecology. It had an Impact Factor of 3.437 and ISI Journal Citation Reports Ranking of 6/70 (Gynaecology) in 2009.

Filmi Devotional songs

Filmi devotional songs (or filmi bhajans) are devotional songs from Hindi movies, or Hindi songs composed to be sung using the melody in a popular filmi song.
While most of these songs relate to Hinduism, often many of the devotional songs are general, and can prove acceptable to followers of other faiths as well.
Selected popular filmi bhajans.
Even though the movies are considered to be decadent, some of the songs are finely crafted spiritual hymns. Here are some examples. Only a small part of the song is given here.
Man Tadapat Hari Darshan Ko Aaj (film "Baiju Bawra", 1952) by Naushad and Shakeel Badayuni
मोरे तुम बिन बिगड़े सकल काज <br>
हमरी ओर नज़र कब होगी <br>
Translation:
(Note that Hinduism is often a very visual faith. A glimpse of the image of the lord can represent spiritual fulfillment to one.
Also note that the term "Hari" specifically means Lord Vishnu, in Sikh tradition, the term is used for the Nirguna God in general.)
Tu Pyar Ka Sagar Hai (film - "Seema", 1955)
This song is dedicated to Goddess Amba, as shown in the film.
तू प्यार का सागर है<br>
तेरी इक बूँद के प्यासे हम<br>
लौटा जो दिया तुमने, चले जायेंगे जहाँ से हम<br>
घायल मन का, पागल पंछी उड़ने को बेक़रार<br>
पंख हैं कोमल, आँख है धुँधली, जाना है सागर पार<br>
जाना है सागर पार<br>
Translation:
You are an ocean of Love,<br>
while we are thirsty of a drop of water. <br>
If you will send us back without it,<br>
we will leave this mortal world. 
Ae Malik Tere Bande Ham (film "Do Aankhen Barah Haath", 1957) by Vasant Desai and Bharat Vyas
ऐसे हो हमारे करम <br>
और बदी से टलें <br>
तब तू ही हमें थामना
Translation:
jyot se jyot jagaate chalo (film "Sant Gyaneshwar", 1964) by Bharat Vyas
ज्योत से ज्योत जगाते चलो, प्रेम की गंगा बहाते चलो <br>
राह में आए जो दीन दुखी, सबको गले से लगाते चलो<br>
जिसका न कोई संगी साथी ईश्वर है रखवाला <br>
जो निर्धन है जो निर्बल है वह है प्रभू का प्यारा<br>
Translation:
Tumhi Ho Mata, Pita Tumhi Ho (film "Main Chup Rahungi", 1962) by Rajendra Krishan and Chitragupta
This filmi song is based on a shloka from Vishwanatha Suprabhata:
त्वमेव माता च पिता त्वमेव त्वमेव बन्धुश्च सखा त्वमेव <br>
The popular Hindi song is:
तुम्ही हो माता, पिता तुम्ही हो,<br>
तुम्ही हो साथी तुम्ही सहारे, <br>
कोइ न अपना सिवा तुम्हारे<br>
तुम्ही हो नैय्या तुम्ही खेवैय्या, <br>
Translation:
Itni shakti hame dena data (film "Ankush", 1986)by Abhilash
इतनी शक्ति हमें देना दाता <br>
मन का विश्वास कमज़ोर हो न<br>
हम चलें नेक रस्ते पे हमसे<br>
हर तरफ़ ज़ुल्म है, बेबसी है<br>
सहमा सहमा-सा हर आदमी है<br>
पाप का बोझ बढता ही जाये<br>
जाने कैसे ये धरती थमी है<br>
बोझ ममता का तू ये उठा ले<br>
तेरी रचना का ये अँत हो न<br>

Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito

Early life.
Born on September 19, 1867, as seventeenth (and posthumous) son of Prince Fushimi Kuniie, head of the Fushimi-no-miya, one of the "shinnōke" branches of the Imperial Family of Japan, which were eligible to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne in the event that the main line should die out. He was a younger half-brother of Field Marshal Prince Komatsu Akihito, Prince Kuni Asahiko, General Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa, Field Marshal Prince Kan'in Kotohito and Field Marshal Prince Fushimi Sadanaru. 
Originally styled "Prince Fushimi Sadamaro", he was adopted into the Yamashina-no-miya household in 1869, followed by the Komatsu-no-miya house in 1885. He was then adopted by Emperor Meiji as a potential heir to the throne in 1886. He succeeded to the Higashifushimi-no-miya title upon the death of the first head, Prince Komatsu Akihito, on February 3, 1903. 
King David Kalākaua, the last reigning king of the Kingdom of Hawaii, visited Japan during his round-the-world tour of 1881. He was the first foreign head of state to visit Japan. During his visit, he proposed a marital alliance between the royal houses of Japan and Hawai'i, wherein his niece (Princess Ka'iulani) would marry Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito (then styled Prince Yamashina Yorihito). Nothing came of the proposal, which might have made a significant impact on the eventual fate of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
Military career.
Prince Higashifushimi Yoshihito attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy briefly, but was then sent to study at Dartmouth Royal Naval College in Great Britain. He lived in France from 1887–1890 and graduated from the École Navale. He returned to Japan on October 7, 1891. After serving on the various vessels in the Imperial Japanese Navy, including combat duty in the First Sino-Japanese War, he became executive officer of the battleship "Fusō" (1901). As captain of the from January 12, 1905, and later as captain of (1905), he served in combat during the Russo-Japanese War, for which he was awarded with the Order of the Golden Kite (3rd Class). After the end of the war, he served as captain of , before joining the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff in 1906. He was promoted to rear admiral on December 1, 1909. 
Prince and Princess Higashifushimi represented Emperor Meiji at the coronation ceremonies of King George V of Great Britain (June 30, 1911). 
After his promotion to vice admiral on August 31, 1913, he served as Commander in Chief of the Yokosuka Naval District in 1916, and Commander in Chief of the IJN 2nd Fleet in 1917. Promoted to admiral on July 2, 1918, he made one last trip to the United Kingdom from 1918–1919, and he was given the posthumous title of marshal admiral and the Collar of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum on his death on June 27, 1922.
Marriage and family.
On February 10, 1898, Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito married Iwakura Kaneko (1876–1955), the eldest daughter of Prince Iwakura Tomomi. As the couple remained childless, the Higashifushimi-no-miya lineage became extinct with the death of Prince Yorihito.
In 1931, Emperor Hirohito directed his brother-in-law, Prince Kuni Kunihide, to leave Imperial Family status and become Count Higashifushimi Kunihide ("hakushaku" under the "kazoku" peerage system), to prevent the Higashifushimi name from dying out. 
Dowager Princess Higashifushimi Kaneko became a commoner on October 14, 1947, with the abolition of the cadet branches of the Imperial Family by the American occupation authorities. She died in Tokyo in 1955.

Schlüsselfeld

Schlüsselfeld is a town on the southwestern edge of the Upper Franconian district of Bamberg
Geography.
Schlüsselfeld lies 24 km southwest of Bamberg in the Steigerwald (forest) in the valley of the Reiche Ebrach, 299 m above sea level.
Constituent communities.
The town of Schlüsselfeld is made up of 22 "Ortsteile", which for the most part were independent communities until administrative reform:
The town also has these traditional rural land units, known in German as "Gemarkungen" (most are former independent communities retained as cadastral areas):
All share names with the town’s constituent communities as it is traditional for a "Gemarkung" to be named after a town or village lying nearby.
From 1972 to 1978, Schlüsselfeld belonged to Middle Franconia.
Climate.
Schlüsselfeld’s average yearly temperature is 8.24 °C.
History.
Schlüsselfeld was founded on 10 June 1336 by Konrad von Schlüsselberg. He was granted the right to found a town by Holy Roman Emperor Ludwig IV. After its founder’s death, Schlüsselfeld passed to the Bishops of Bamberg and Würzburg. Through a compromise, Würzburg also acquired Bamberg’s share of the town in 1390.
In 1396, the market town of Schlüsselfeld had its town rights confirmed.
The Würzburg Bishops built Schlüsselfeld up into an "Amt" and chose as their "Amt" seat the Thüngfeld Castle ("Thüngfelder Schloss").
The town hall built in 1723 declares the following in a Latin inscription:
“"This house hates unrest, loves peace, punishes crime, upholds the law, honours goodness. "”
As part of the Würzburg High Monastery, the tithing centre ("Centamt") of Schlüsselfeld was secularized in Bavaria’s favour in 1803, passed in 1805 with the Peace of Pressburg to the newly formed Grand Duchy of Würzburg, and then eventually, after territorial adjustments in 1810, was returned to Bavaria. In the course of administrative reform in Bavaria, today’s community came into being under the "Gemeindeedikt" (“Community Edict”) of 1818.
Religion.
Of the town’s inhabitants, 4,262 belong to the Catholic Church, 1,217 to the Evangelical Church and 588 to other religious bodies.
Population development.
Within town limits, 4,780 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 5,034 in 1987 and 5,711 in 2000. Over the next six years, the population rose and on 31 December 2006, it had reached 5,824.
Politics.
The mayor is Georg Zipfel (FWG).
In 1999, municipal tax revenue, converted to euros, amounted to €2,715,000 of which business taxes (net) amounted to €817,000.
Town council.
Town council consists of:
Coat of arms.
Schlüsselfeld’s arms might heraldically be described thus: In gules a key argent per bend sinister with the bit upturned, flanked per bend each side by a mullet of six Or.
The key refers not only to the town’s name (“Schlüsselfeld” literally means “Key Field” in German), but also by its charges and tinctures to the arms borne by the old Lords of Schlüsselberg, who have since died out, but who were once the town’s owners and founders. The town was first mentioned in history as Konrad von Schlüsselberg’s property. The current coat of arms appeared for the first time in a seal from the 16th century. The town flag is gold, white and red.
Culture and sightseeing.
Worth seeing in the Schlüsselfeld area are the following:
Economy and infrastructure.
The town of Schlüsselfeld lies at the common point of all three of Franconia’s "Regierungsbezirke", right on the A 3 (Würzburg-Nuremberg) with its "Schlüsselfeld" interchange, and is acknowledged as a smaller centre.

In addition, he has appeared on several TV shows, including "Ellen", "Casualty", "Guiding Light", "Grey's Anatomy", "Ultimate Force", "", "Heroes", "Covert Affairs" and "Numb3rs".
He made a conscious decision to not audition for stereotypical Indian roles, although he has been offered such parts. Ramamurthy's role on "Heroes" was his biggest to date. Although the character of Mohinder Suresh was originally written for a 55-year-old, his audition tape and screen test were convincing enough for writers to rewrite the part for Ramamurthy. Ramamurthy starred in all four seasons of "Heroes", although his appearance in the final season was limited; had the series been recommissioned for a fifth season, he would not have returned for it.
In 2000, he appeared in NBC's television biblical miniseries "In the Beginning" in the role of Adam.
Ramamurthy guest starred in a season four episode of "Psych" titled "Bollywood Homicide", directed by Jay Chandrasekhar.
Ramamurthy joined the cast of the USA Network show "Covert Affairs" as Jai Wilcox from the second episode onward, replacing character Conrad Sheehan III, played by Eric Lively in the pilot. The show premiered in July 2010. His character was written out of the show in the premiere of season 3.
In 2012, Ramamurthy appeared in the eighth season of "The Office" as Kelly Kapoor's new boyfriend, Ravi.
On December 19, 2012, it was announced that he would appear in the CW show "Beauty & the Beast" as Gabriel Lowen, an assistant district attorney.

Rotoroa Island is an island to the east of Waiheke Island in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand. It covers . The Salvation Army purchased it for £400 in 1908 from the Ruthe family to expand their alcohol and drug rehabilitation facility at nearby Pakatoa Island. Men were treated at Home Bay at Rotoroa, while women were treated at Pakatoa. This treatment facility was closed in 2005.
The island was leased from the Salvation Army in February 2008 by Neal and Annette Plowman, who formed a trust to create a conservation park on the island. They have begun a revegetation project which will eventually include 400,000 native plants. The chapel, schoolhouse and jail are being restored and a visitor centre will be built. They gave the island to Auckland in February 2010 and it was opened on 26 February 2011.
The island is accessible through various ferry and air service companies.

Hanina ben Dosa

Hanina ben Dosa (1st century, CE) () was a scholar and miracle-worker, and the pupil of Johanan ben Zakkai ("Berakhot", 34b). He is buried in the City of Arraba.
While he is reckoned among the Tannaim and is quoted in connection with a school and its disciples, no halachot and but few aggadot are preserved as from him (Baraita of R. Eliezer xxix., xxxi.; Midr. Mishle x. 2). He is "remembered more for his conduct than for his halakhic teachings. There are no laws quoted in his name." His popularity, however, which he enjoyed throughout his life, and which rendered him immortal among the mystics, rests not on his scholarship, but on his saintliness and thaumaturgic powers. From the several maxims attributed to him it may be seen that he was a member of the ancient Hasidim: "Whosoever's fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom will endure; but where wisdom precedes fear of sin, wisdom will not endure"; "Where a man's works are greater than his learning, his learning will stand; but where his learning is greater than his works, his learning will not stand"; "Whosoever earns the good-will of humanity is loved of God; but whoso is not beloved of man is not beloved of God" ("Avoth", iii. 9, 10; "Avot of Rabbi Natan", xxii. 1 Schechter, p. 35a). There are, also, other teachings which betray his Hasidic schooling. Hanina, like all the ancient Hasidim, prayed much, and by his prayers he is said to have effected many miracles.
Influence of His Prayers.
It is related that when the son of Johanan ben Zakkai was very sick, the father solicited the prayers of Hanina. Hanina readily complied, and the child recovered. The overjoyed father could not refrain from expressing his admiration for his wonderful pupil, stating that he himself might have prayed the whole day without doing any good. His wife, astonished at such self-abasement on the part of her famous husband, inquired, "Is Hanina greater than thou?" To this he replied, "There is this difference between us: he is like the body-servant of a king, having at all times free access to the august presence, without even having to await permission to reach his ears; while I, like a lord before a king, must await an opportune moment" ("Berakhot", 34b). Similarly, at the solicitation of Gamaliel II, Hanina entreated mercy for that patriarch's son, and at the conclusion of his prayers assured Gamaliel's messengers that the patient's fever had left him. This assurance created doubt in the minds of the messengers, who promptly asked, "Art thou a prophet?" To this he replied, "I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet; but experience has taught me that whenever my prayer flows freely it is granted; otherwise, it is rejected." The messengers thereupon noted down Hanina's declaration, and the exact time when it was made; on reaching the patriarch's residence they found that Hanina had spoken truly ("ibidem"; compare "Berakhot", v. 5 and "Yerushalmi Berakhot", v. 9d).
Hanina never permitted anything to turn him from his devotions. Once, while thus engaged, a lizard bit him, but he did not interrupt his prayers. To his disciples' anxious inquiries he answered that he had been so preoccupied in prayer as not even to feel the bite. When the people found the reptile, dead, they exclaimed, "Woe to the man whom a lizard bites, and woe to the lizard that bites R. Hanina ben Dosa!" His wonderful escape is accounted for by the assertion that the result of a lizard's bite depends upon which reaches water first, the man or the lizard; if the former, the latter dies; if the latter, the former dies. In Hanina's case a spring miraculously opened under his very feet ("Yerushalmi Berakhot", v. 9a). The Babylonian Gemara ("Berakhot", 33a) has a different version of this miracle.
As Rain-Producer.
Hanina's prayers were efficacious in other directions also. While traveling he was caught in a shower and prayed "Master of the universe, the whole world is pleased, while Hanina alone is annoyed." The rain immediately ceased. Arriving home, he altered his prayer: "Master of the universe, shall all the world be grieved while Hanina enjoys his comfort?" Thereupon copious showers descended. With reference to his rain-governing powers it was said, "Beside Ben Dosa's prayers those of the high priest himself are of no avail" ("Ta'anit", 24b). When, one Sabbath eve, his daughter filled the lamp with vinegar instead of oil, and then sadly told him of her mistake, he remarked, "He who hath endowed oil with the power of burning may endow vinegar with the same power"; and the lamp burned on throughout the whole of the next day ("Ta'anit", 25a).
The Miracle of the Golden Table-Leg.
Notwithstanding his wonder-working powers, Hanina was very poor. Indeed, it became proverbial that, while the whole world was provided for through Hanina's great merits, he himself sustained life from one Sabbath eve to another on a basket of carob-beans. For some time the outside world had been kept in ignorance of his privations; his wife did all that was possible to maintain an appearance of comfort, and though she had no flour with which to make dough, she would put fuel into the oven every Friday and cause columns of smoke to rise, thus making her neighbors believe that, like them, she was baking the Sabbath meals. In time, however, one woman's suspicion was aroused, and she determined to surprise Hanina's wife and discover the truth. But a miracle prevented exposure. When the woman appeared at Hanina's house and looked into the smoking oven it was full of loaves. In spite of the miracle, Hanina's wife induced him to collect from heaven an advance portion of his future lot. Hanina complied with her request, and, in answer to his prayer, a golden table-leg was miraculously sent him. Husband and wife were happy; but that night the wife had a vision of heaven in which she saw the saints feasting at three-legged tables while her husband's table had only two legs. She awoke full of regret at the importunity which had deprived his table of a leg, and insisted that he pray for the withdrawal of the treasure. This he did, and the golden leg disappeared. Of this miracle the Talmud says: "It was greater than the former, since heaven gives, but never takes" ("Ta'anit", 24b et seq.).
By a miracle Hanina was once prevented from partaking of untithed food. One eve of Sabbath he sat down to his frugal meal, when suddenly the table receded from him. After thinking a while he recollected that he had borrowed some spices from a neighbor and that he had not separated the required tithe (see Ḥaber). He thereupon adjusted the matter, and the table returned to him ("Yerushalmi Demai", i. 22a). It is stated that Hanina's donkey would not eat untithed food. Thieves had stolen the animal and confined it in their yard, furnishing it with the necessary provender; but the donkey would neither eat nor drink. As this continued for several days, the thieves concluded to free the animal, lest it starve to death and render their premises noisome. On its release it went straight home, none the worse for its long fast ("Avot of Rabbi Natan", viii. 8 Schechter, p. 19b; cf "Yerushalmi Demai", i. 21d; "Shabbat", 112b).
Once Hanina was greatly grieved at not being able, with other pious people, to present something to the Temple. In his despondency he walked out of town, and, seeing a huge rock, he vowed to carry it to Jerusalem as a gift to the Holy City. He smoothed and polished it, and then looked aroundfor help to transport it. Five laborers appeared, and offered to carry the rock to its destined place for one hundred gold pieces. Hanina, who did not possess half that amount, turned away in despair. Soon, however, other laborers appeared and demanded only five "sela'im," but they stipulated that Hanina himself should aid in the transportation. The agreement concluded, they all seized the rock, and in an instant stood before Jerusalem. When Hanina turned to pay the laborers they were nowhere to be found. He repaired to the Sanhedrin to inquire what disposition he should make of the uncollected wages. The Sanhedrin heard his tale and concluded that the laborers were ministering angels, not human laborers, and that Hanina was therefore at liberty to apply the money to his own use. He, however, presented it to the Temple (Cant. R. i. 1; Eccl. R. i.).
Thus was Hanina's life a succession of miracles (see "Pesahim", 112b; "Bava Kamma", 50a). A comparatively late mishnah remarks, "With the death of Hanina ben Dosa wonder-workers ("anshe ma'aseh") ceased to exist" ("Sotah", ix. 15). His general character was likewise extolled. A contemporary rabbi, Eleazar of Modi'im, lecturing on "Exodus" xviii. 21, cited Hanina ben Dosa and his colleagues as illustrations of the scope of the expression "men of truth" (Mek., Yitro, Amalek, 1). Two centuries later a haggadist, commenting on "Isaiah" iii. 3, said, "By the term 'honorable man' is meant one through whose merits Heaven respects favorable to his generation; such a one was Hanina ben Dosa" ("Hagigah", 14a). Nor was Hanina's wife soon forgotten; long after her death, legend relates, a party of seafarers espied a work-basket studded with diamonds and pearls. A diver attempted to seize it, but was deterred by a "bat kol" which said that the precious basket was designed for the wife of Hanina ben Dosa, who would eventually fill it with blue wool (tekelet; "Numbers", xv. 38) for the saints of the future ("Bava Batra", 74a).
Hanina lived at 'Arab, in Galilee, whither he was first attracted by the fame of Johanan ben Zakkai ("Berakhot", 34b). There he served as an example of Sabbath observance ("Yerushalmi Berakhot", iv. 7c), and there he and his wife were buried.
Story of the Bite.
There are two stories of how Haninah ben Dosa was bitten by a lizzard (or snake) while praying (""Babylonian Gemara" and "Jerusalem Talmud""):
Y. Ber 5. 1/26 (9a)
<BR>
When it bites the son of man (בר נשא : nasha'), if the son of man (בר נשא : nasha') reaches the water first, then snake dies; and if the snake reaches the water first, the son of man (בר נשא : nasha') dies.
"Ḥanina never permitted anything to turn him from his devotions. Once, while thus engaged, a lizard bit him, but he did not interrupt his prayers. To his disciples' anxious inquiries he answered that he had been so preoccupied in prayer as not even to feel the bite. When the people found the reptile, dead, they exclaimed, "Wo to the man whom a lizard bites, and wo to the lizard that bites R. Ḥanina b. Dosa!" His wonderful escape is accounted for by the assertion that the result of a lizard's bite depends upon which reaches water first, the man or the lizard; if the former, the latter dies; if the latter, the former dies. In Ḥanina's case a spring miraculously opened under his very feet (Yer. Ber. v. 9a). The Babylonian Gemara (Ber. 33a) has a different version of this miracle."

A. Michael Noll

A. Michael Noll (born 1939, Newark, New Jersey) is an American engineer, and professor emeritus at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California. He was a very early pioneer in digital computer art and 3D animation and tactile communication.
Biography.
Noll has a B.S.E.E. from Newark College of Engineering (currently known as "New Jersey Institute of Technology"), an M.E.E. from New York University, and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. 
Before joining the Annenberg School for Communication, Noll had a varied career in basic research, telecommunication marketing, and science policy. He worked in the AT&T Consumer Products and Marketing Department where he performed technical evaluations and identified opportunities for new products and services, such as teleconferencing and videotex.
He has been Director of Technology Research and a Senior Affiliated Research Fellow at the Columbia Institute for Tele-information at Columbia University's Business School. He has been also affiliated with the Media Center at New York Law School, has been a senior advisor to the Marconi Society, and was an adjunct faculty member of the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. 
In the early 1970s, Noll was on the staff of the President's Science Advisor at the White House and was involved with such issues as computer security and privacy, computer exports, scientific and technical information, and educational technology.
From 1992 to 1994, Noll was dean of the USC Annenberg School for Communication for an interim period. During this time he formulated a broader vision of communication that resulted in a merger of USC academic units that study communication. He joined the faculty of the Annenberg School as a professor of communications in 1984 and became emeritus in 2006.
The electrical-engineering honor society Eta Kappa Nu awarded him Honorable Mention as an Outstanding Young Electrical Engineer in 1970. In 1990, the Computer Graphics Pioneers of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) elected him a Pioneer in recognition of his early work in computer graphics.
Work.
Bell Labs in the early 1960s was extremely pioneering in the beginnings of digital computer art (A. Michael Noll), digital computer animation (Edward E. Zajac, Frank Sinden, and Kenneth C. Knowlton), and digital computer music (Max V. Mathews and John R. Pierce).
Noll spent nearly fifteen years performing basic research at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey in such areas as the effects of media on interpersonal communication, three-dimensional computer graphics and animation, human-machine tactile communication, speech signal processing, cepstrum pitch determination, and aesthetics.
Noll was one of the first researchers to use a digital computer to create artistic patterns and to formalize the use of random and algorithmic processes in the creation of visual arts. His initial digital computer art was programmed in the summer of 1962 at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ, making him one of the earliest digital computer artists. 
In 1965 Noll along with two other pioneers within the field of early computer art, Frieder Nake and Georg Nees in Germany, were the first to exhibit publicly their computer art. During April 1965, the Howard Wise Gallery in New York City exhibited Noll's computer art along with random-dot patterns by Bela Julesz. Later in 1965, Noll's digital computer art was exhibited along with the analogue computer art of Maughan Mason at the Fall Joint Computer conference in Las Vegas. Noll proposed in the 1960s that the digital computer might become a creative artistic medium. All of his digital art was programmed in FORTRAN and FORTRAN subroutine packages that he wrote.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Noll constructed interactive three-dimensional input devices and displays and a three-dimensional, tactile, force-feedback ("feelie") device (US patent 3,919,691 "Tactile Man-Machine Communications System" filed May 26, 1971, issued November 1, 1975). This device was the forerunner of today's virtual-reality systems, and Noll suggested its use as a way for the blind to "feel" computer graphics. He also was one of the first researchers to demonstrate the potential of scanned raster displays for computer graphics. He was an early pioneer in the creation of stereoscopic computer-animated movies of four-dimensional hyper-objects, of a computer-generated ballet, and of computer-animated title sequences for TV and film. 
His experiment comparing a computer-generated pattern with a painting by Mondrian was an early implementation of the Turing Test and an example of the use of digital computers in investigations of aesthetics.
Publications.
Noll has published over ninety professional papers, has been granted six patents, and is the author of ten books on various aspects of telecommunications, communications, and Bell Telephone Laboratories.
He has been a regular contributor of opinion and columnist pieces to newspapers and trade magazines with over 150 published. He has been quoted frequently about telecommunications and the telecommunication industry by the media. He has been a reviewer of classical music performances for the Classical New Jersey Society.

Premio Parioli

The Premio Parioli is a Group 3 flat horse race in Italy open to three-year-old thoroughbred colts. It is run over a distance of 1,600 metres (about 1 mile) at Capannelle in April.
It is Italy's equivalent of the 2,000 Guineas, a famous race in England.
History.
The event is named after Parioli, an area of Rome to the north of the racecourse. It was established in 1907, and the inaugural running was won by Gostaco.
The race was originally open to both colts and fillies. The first filly to win was Wistaria in 1910, and the last was Saccaroa in 1950.
For a period the Premio Parioli held Group 1 status. It was downgraded to Group 2 level in 1996, and to Group 3 in 2007.
The Premio Parioli is currently run on the same day as its fillies' counterpart, the Premio Regina Elena.

Time and Tide (2000 film)

Time and Tide is a 2000 Hong Kong action film directed by Tsui Hark. The film is set in Hong Kong where a young man becomes a bodyguard and befriends a mercenary determined to begin life a new with the woman he just married. The two men find themselves working together to foil an assassination attempt which propels them toward confrontation with each other.
The film was re-written several times during production and post-production stages to accommodate director Tsui Hark's casting choices. The film was nominated for six Hong Kong Film Awards and received generally positive reviews from western critics.
Plot.
Tyler (Nicholas Tse) impregnates a lesbian cop, Ah Jo (Cathy Tsui),after a drunken night. He joins an unlicensed bodyguard service led by Uncle Ji (Anthony Wong), to earn money to give to Ah Jo who wants nothing to do with him. Nearly nine months later, Tyler meets up with a butcher named Jack (Wu Bai) and his pregnant wife, Ah Hui (Candy Lo), who helps Tyler, at Ah Hui's father's birthday, prevent the father's assassination. Tyler tries to convince Jack to start a bodyguard service with him, but Jack turns him down.
A group of South American and Chinese mercenaries, known as the "Angels", arrive and threaten Jack, who they call Juan, and their second in command Miguel (Couto Remotigue) offers him a chance to rejoin them if he kills his own father-in-law. Instead, Jack kills the leader of the "Angels" and evades Uncle Ji's bodyguards, knocking Tyler out in the process, and then steals a case full of cash from under their noses and escapes from the Angels. Jack drops his wife off at her father's mansion, giving her a key to a train station locker and telling her to go there when their child is born. Tyler is interrogated by the cops in connection with Jack, who accuse him of being connected to the killer because he saw him up close. Tyler tells them nothing.
An Jo tries unsuccessfully to parole Tyler, but Uncle Ji succeeds. Tyler thanks An Jo, and Uncle Ji locks him up in a transportation crate for a night before letting him out and getting Tyler to tell him about Jack. Uncle Ji gives Tyler more money, which Tyler tries to give to Ah Jo; he finds out that she has just gone into the hospital to give birth. Tyler heads off after Jack, and breaks into his apartment only to find the "Angels" and Jack have the place staked out.
A running gun battle ensues between Jack and the "Angels" as Tyler desperately tries to survive in Jack's apartment. Tyler ends up trapped in the apartment with the gas leaking and only manages to survive the explosion by hiding in the refrigerator. Jack tricks the "Angels" into killing one of their own and distracting them long enough so he and Tyler can escape the rest. Miguel admits defeat and tries to call a truce with Jack, but then calls it off when one of the other "Angels" spots Jack's wife who arrives on the scene to see her former apartment burning.
The "Angels" take off after An Hui, following her to the train station. Tyler steals a taxi with his fake gun, giving his wallet to the driver, who promptly takes it to the cops. The police, still suspicious of Tyler from earlier, place him at the scene of the gun battle and explosion send a SWAT team after him to the station. At the station, Tyler confronts An Hui with his fake gun and takes the money Jack stole from the "Angels". An Hui goes into labor and one of the "Angels" shoots a cop, and an innocent, while trying to shoot Tyler.
In the ensuing panic, Tyler drags An Hui off to safety and the SWAT team arrives to deal with the situation. As they send in a medic team to retrieve An Hui, the "Angels" open fire on them. Jack arrives on the scene just before the SWAT team, including Miguel and other disguised "Angels", starts a full invasion with tear gas. In the midst of the gases, Jack, the "Angels", and the SWAT team hunt one another, with SWAT officers silently killed one by one by the "Angels", who then disguise themselves in the SWAT gear from the fallen officers, enabling them to kill even more unsuspecting officers. Tyler escapes with An Hui to the railway tracks, where Jack saves the life of the SWAT team lieutenant and surrenders to him.
The remaining "Angels" escape through a tunnel to a stadium full of concert goers. Tyler has to hunker down in the tunnels as An Hui starts to give birth, and Jack convinces the SWAT Lieutenant to let him go after Miguel in the stadium. Jack confronts Miguel in the catwalks above the concert goers and defeats him. Meanwhile, Tyler helps An Hui successfully give birth before the last of the "Angels" shows up. A fight ensues, and just as Tyler is about to lose, the last of the "Angels" gets shot repeatedly by An Hui.
Jack is given a head start to escape the police and visits with his wife, and Tyler recovers the money before going off to the hospital to see his child.
Production.
Production on "Time and Tide" began in 1999. It was written by director Tsui Hark and Koan Hui. Hui and Hark had collaborated previously on the screenplay for "The Blade". Actor Nicholas Tse opted out of appearing in the sequel to "Gen-X Cops" to be in "Time and Tide". Tse announced that it would be his last action film as he desired to focus on his musical career. It was not his last action film as he starred in Wong Jing's "My Schoolmate The Barbarian" in 2001. After seeing Wu Bai in the Taiwanese film "The Personals", Tsui offered Wu the role in "Time and Tide". Wu's character was rewritten with him in mind by making him more of a sad loner to match the music he made with his band in China Blue. Cathy Tsui was cast as Ah Jo in the film. She found a scene involving her playing with a dog difficult as she was afraid of them. To make her more comfortable, she was sent to a dog farm where she played with dogs every day to become comfortable around them.
The film was radically altered in post-production. The original cut was over three hours long, which Tsui Hark considered to be too slow-paced. He reorganized the entire script including cutting many of Nicholas Tse and Anthony Wong Chau Sang's scenes, leaving Wu Bai's sequences as they were.
Release.
The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 2000. The film was released in Hong Kong on 19 October 2000. The film made HK$ 4,465,047 in Hong Kong. The film was released in 4 May 2001 in the United States.
Reception.
At the Hong Kong Film Awards, the film received six nominations including Best New Performer and Best Supporting Actress (Candy Lo), Best Film Editing (Marco Mak), Best Action Choreography (Xiong Xin Xin), Best Original Film Score (Tommy Wai, Joventine Couto Remotigue), and Best Sound Design. The film received generally positive reviews from western critics. The film received 63% positive reviews at the film rating website Rotten Tomatoes.

USS Inca (IX-229)

USS "Inca", a 3,381-ton (light displacement) "Liberty" ship, was launched in March 1943 at Los Angeles, California, and entered merchant service later the same month as S.S. "William B. Allison", MCE hull 724. Two years later she would be taken into US Navy as stores ship and renamed USS "Inca" (IX-229). For much of her service as "Inca" she was also named USS "Gamage" (IX-227) because of bureaucratic confusion.
Service history.
On 25 May 1945 she was damaged by an aircraft torpedo off Nakagusuku Wan, Okinawa, and although towed into port she was considered a constructive total loss, not suitable for repair. On 25 July 1945, based on a recommendation from the local War Shipping Administration (WSA) official, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) authorized Commander Service Division (ComServDiv) 104 to accept the ship "as is" at Okinawa and place her in service for non-self propelled floating dry storage. ComServDiv 104 accepted her at Okinawa on 30 July and on 6 August the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) approved the name "Inca" and designator IX-229 for her. She was converted to a storage ship by USS "Vestal" (AR-4) and USS "Zaniah" (AG-70), and was in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, when typhoons struck on 16 September and 9 October 1945. During the September typhoon she was hit by a merchant ship and suffered topside damage that was considered repairable, and she continued to issue supplies to ships in the bay. During the October typhoon she broke adrift and was one of several ships that USS "Nestor" (ARB-6) reported nearly hit her as "Nestor" was inexorably being driven ashore. "Inca" went aground during the storm and remained aground afterward, but plans to survey her in late October were canceled and she appears to have remained in service as a storage ship into December.
Name Confusion.
"Inca" was placed in the category "grounded ships, salvage not warranted" on 2 January 1946, and on 12 January 1946 ComServDiv 104 reported that the ship was no longer required, that an informal inspection indicated needed repairs were too extensive, and asked that she be returned to WSA. In turn, the Commander in Chief, Pacific (CINCPAC) asked CNO what disposition was desired for "Inca". CNO's response of 15 January, "above incorrect," was probably the first clear indication received in the Pacific that the name and designation they had been using for this ship for the past five months were wrong. Back in early July 1945 the Navy had planned to take over another damaged Liberty ship, "Henry L. Abbott", for self-propelled floating storage of lubricants and drummed petroleum products at Ulithi, and on 14 July SECNAV approved the name "Gamage" and designation IX-227 for the ex-"Henry L. Abbott". On 21 July, however, CNO wrote to the War Shipping Administration and asked that his request of 13 July for the "Henry L. Abbott" be canceled, because her poor hull condition made her unsuitable for use as dry cargo floating storage. CNO had already advised CINCPAC a day earlier of the cancellation of "Henry L. Abbott". The Navy later decided to shift the name "Gamage" and the designation IX-227 to the ex-"William B. Allison" and cancel the name and number given that ship on 6 August. This directive has not come to light in the archives, and the cryptic question sent to CINCPAC by CNO on 17 August, "Request information re acceptances "William B. Allison" for "Gamage" (IX-227) in lieu of "Henry L. Abbott"" appears to have gone unappreciated when CINCPAC on 24 August and again on 4 September reported the 30 July acceptance. The ex-"William B. Allison" was consistently called "Inca" in all reporting from the Pacific Theater through mid-January 1946, and a photograph of her ashore at Buckner Bay appears to show the hull number IX-229 painted on her bow.
Disposition.
On 15 January 1946 CNO directed that the ship be redelivered to WSA. She was placed out of service on 8 February 1946, when she was reported lying on the bottom in Yonabaru Wan, Buckner Bay, Okinawa, with water in the holds up to the tween-decks. and was stricken from the Navy List on 12 March 1946. On 26 February CNO told the naval base at Okinawa that WSA Okinawa was authorized to accept redelivery, but on 27 March the Okinawa naval base replied that WSA Okinawa refused to accept delivery without a specific directive from WSA Washington. The ship was finally redelivered to WSA as she lay on 6 April 1946. The Maritime Commission sold her under her merchant name with seven other Okinawa wrecks, including USS Ocelot (IX-110), Vandalia (IX-191) and five civilian Liberty ships, to China Merchants and Engineers, Inc., for scrap. The ships were delivered to the buyer on 19 February 1948 under the condition that they be scrapped within two years and three months. An extension was later granted, and scrapping of all the ships except one of the civilian vessels was reported complete on 31 January 1952.

Napoleon (musical)

Napoleon is a musical by Canadians Andrew Sabiston and Timothy Williams. It premiered at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto on 23 March 1994 with Jérôme Pradon in the title role and Aline Mowat as leading lady Josephine. Directed by John Wood and orchestrated by David Cullen, it was the largest ever Canadian musical, with a budget of five million dollars. It was nominated for a Dora Award for Best Musical.
The musical was later produced at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London with previews from 30 September 2000 and officially opened on 13 October 2000, starring Paul Baker and Uwe Kröger (who performed three of the eight a week in the title role), with Anastasia Barzee as Josephine. It was directed by Francesca Zambello, and legendary West End producer by Duncan Weldon. The orchestrations were by Jonathan Tunick.
Napoleon ran for six months. While Friday through Sunday were sold out, Tuesday through Thursday were slow. With 32 in the cast and an orchestra of 28, producers cited the high running costs as the principal reason for closure. The show closed on 3 February, just two months after the booking period was extended to 28 April 2001.
The show celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2009 with a brand new concert version in Barrie, Ontario. It was directed by Richard Ouzounian. The concert version starred Canada's own Adam Brazier (previously seen on Broadway in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "The Woman in White" and Blythe Wilson). To mark the anniversary the original 1994 cast album with Jérôme Pradon and Aline Mowat was released by Stage Door Records (UK), with 15 tracks. The original release was 18 tracks.
Andrew Sabiston is a television and theatre writer in Toronto, and Timothy Williams went on to be a film/television composer. In addition, he orchestrated and conducted "300", "Watchmen" and "The Day The Earth Stood Still". He has won a Dora Award and two Thea awards.
Plot.
The plot of Napoleon centers mostly on two aspects - Napoleon Bonaparte's rise from a common man to a leading war general (and leader) of France. Secondly, it focuses on the romantic relationship of Napoleon and his first wife, Joséphine de Beauharnais. In the musical, Josephine sings most of the memorable numbers including "The Friend You Were to Me," "Only in Fantasy" and "On That First Night" (which is a duet with Napoleon).
Recordings.
The original cast recording of Napoleon was released by EMI Angel Broadway and has become a cult item. A bonus track was recorded by Dan Hill and reached number 16 on the Canadian charts. Songs from Napoleon have been covered by Dan Hill, Stig Rossen, Uwe Kröger, Stephanie Martin, Adam Brazier, and Blythe Wilson.
Songs were recently incorporated into Field of Dreams and Anthology of Canadian Musicals. Excerpts can frequently be heard on Radio programs hosted by Richard Ouzounian in Canada and Elaine Paige in England.
In 2001, First Night Records released a 5-track Cast Recording for sale of the Original London Cast. Re-orchestrated, it features only one new song ("Only In Fantasy"), sung by Anastasia Barzee. The entire full score with the large orchestra was recorded and is available for listening on the official website, but unfortunately due to union contracts and payment issues, the cast recording remains unreleased for purchasing.
In 2009, there was a limited re-release celebrating the 15th anniversary, featuring 15 tracks instead of 18.
In 2001, Uwe Kröger recorded the song "Sweet Victory Divine", Napoleon's rousing Act 1 Finale, for the CD version of the concert "So In Love With Musicals", also starring Pia Douwes.

<doc id="5969439" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5969439" title="GalP (protein)">
GalP (protein)

The galactose permease or GalP found in "Escherichia coli" is an integral membrane protein involved in the transport of monosaccharides, primarily hexoses, for utilization by "E. coli" in glycolysis and other metabolic and catabolic pathways (3,4). It is a member of the Major Facilitator Super Family (MFS) and is homologue of the human GLUT1 transporter (4). Below you will find descriptions of the structure, specificity, effects on homeostasis, expression, and regulation of GalP along with examples of several of its homologues.
Structure.
Galactose Permease (GalP), is a member of the Major Facilitator Super Family (MFS) and therefore has structural similarities to the other members of this super family such as GLUT1 (4). All members of the MFS have 12 membrane spanning alpha(α)-helices with both the C- and N-termini located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (4). Figure 1a (3) depicts how the 12 helices are divided into two halves, that are pseudo-symmetric, of 6 helices which are attached by a long hydrophilic cytoplasmic loop between helix 6 and helix 7 (2,3,4). These two halves come together to form a pore for substrate transport, in GalP, the substrates are primarily galactose, glucose, and H+. GalP monomers have a pore of approximately 10Å in diameter, which is consistent with the pore sizes found in other members of the MFS, between 10-15Å (4). GalP has been found as an oligomer formed by a homotrimer of GalP monomers that exhibits p3 or 3-fold rotational symmetry (Figure 1b-c) (4). GalP is the first member of the MFS that has been found as a trimer and to be biologically active in its trimeric form; it is thought that the GalP oligomer is formed for stability (4).
Specificity.
GalP is a monosaccharide transporter that uses a chemiosmotic mechanism to transport its substrates into the cytoplasm of "E. coli" (1). Glucose, galactose and other hexoses are transported by GalP by the use of the proton gradient produced by the electron transport chain and reversible ATPase (1). GalP can bind specifically to the hexoses with preferential binding of galactose and glucose through the pores in each monomer (2,3). It transports these sugars at faster rates with a proton gradient but can still transport them in a leaky fashion without a proton gradient present (4). As stated before GalP shares similarities with GLUT1 and other members of the MFS and like GLUT1, GalP can be inhibited by the antibiotics cytochalasin B and forskolin (Figure 1a) (3), which competitively bind to the pore blocking sugar transport into the cell (2,3,4). Forskolin is a structural homologue of D-galactose (Figure 1a) (3) and therefore can bind with a similar affinity to the transporter. Cytochalasin B may bind to an asparagine residue (Asn394) in the pore, blocking saccharide uptake, which is also found in the GLUT1 transporter (2,3). GalP can transport lactose or fructose but with low affinity, only allowing these sugars to "leak" across the membrane when glucose, galactose, or other hexoses aren't present for transport (4).
Homeostasis.
The GalP symporter links galactose and proton import, using the favorable proton concentration gradient to move galactose against its concentration gradient. However, this mechanism, if in isolation, would result in acidification of the cytoplasm and cessation of galactose import(14). To prevent this, "E. coli" utilizes ion pumps designed to raise intracellular pH (13,14). During electron transport (a key step in ATP production in respiration), energy harnessed from electrons is used to pump protons into the periplasmic space to build a proton motive force. Primary proton pumps, responsible for pumping protons out of the cytoplasm, can be active without the synthesis of ATP and are the primary mechanism through which protons are exported (13,14). Coupling galactose/proton import with proton export would maintain pH homeostasis. As protons are charged molecules, their import or export could disrupt the membrane potential of the cell (14). However, simultaneous import and export of protons would result in no change in the net charge of the cell, thus no net change in membrane potential.
Regulation/Expression.
The GalP/H+ symporter is the galactose permease from the "galP" gene of the "Eschericha coli" genome. Galactose is an alternate carbon source to the preferable glucose . The cAMP/CRP catabolite repression regulator is most likely involved in the regulation of GalP expression (Figure 2) (9). The two proteins responsible for inhibiting transcription from the gal regulon are GalR and GalS (Figure 4) (11). GalR and GalS have very similar primary structure sequences, and have the same binding sites on the operator (11). In the presence of D-galactose, GalR and GalS are inhibited since they are repressors (5, 11). However, when GalP is not required (i.e. when glucose is available), GalR/GalS will bind the promoter operator site thus blocking transcription and preventing cAMP-CRP activation (11). GalS is seen to bind only in the presence of GalR, so both of these proteins are required for repression (11). cAMP is what modulates CRP at the promoter. The cAMP-CRP complex activates the gal regulon and is responsible for upregulation of GalP (Figure 2) (9,11). GalP is also repressed in the presence of glucose since the cell will prefer glucose over galactose (7). 
There is also a study on the involvement of NagC in regulation, a protein from the nagC gene which is responsible for N-acetylglucosamine repression (5). This study suspects that NagC cooperates with GalR and GalS by binding to a single-high affinity site upstream of the galP promoter as well in order to suppress gal regulon transcription (5).
Other Bacteria Symporters.
Several other symporters have been identified in "E. coli" and in other bacteria. "E. coli" has a well-studied GltS glutamate/Na+ symporter that aids in the uptake of glutamate into the cell along with an influx of sodium ions. It also has a serine-threonine symporter, SstT, that also uses an influx of sodium ions for solute uptake.
A Na+/glucose symporter (SglT) has been identified in "Vibrio parahaemolyticus" (10). Sodium ions induced the cells’ uptake of glucose in a study of phosphotransferase-system (PTS) mutants (10). "Clostridum difficle" has a symporter homologous to that of the "V. parahaemolyticus" SglT (6). A citrate/Na+ symporter, CitS, seems to be common between "Vibrio cholerae", "Salmonella" Typhi, and "Klebsiella pneumoniae" (6). This symporter uses the influx of sodium ions in order to bring citrate into the cell, which is an important substrate to have for metabolic processes such as decarboxylation of oxaloacetate (6). A H+/amino acid symporter BrnQ can be found in "Lactobacillus delbruckii", and "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" has the BraB symporter for substrates such as glutamate as well (6).
Solute/ion symporters are very commonly found in bacteria since they are very important. Homeostasis and regulated uptake for metabolic pathways is essential for bacterial survival.
GLUT-1: A Eukaryotic Homolog.
GalP is homologous to GLUT-1 found in mammalian cells (12). Both transporters are MFS transporters and possess 29% sequence identity (4). GLUT-1 is a glucose transporter present in most mammalian cells (Figure 5) (12). Its structure is nearly identical to that of GalP – possessing cytoplasmic amino and carboxy termini, twelve membrane spanning α helices, a periplasmic glycosylation site between helices 1 and 2, and a cytoplasmic α-helix loop between helices 6 and 7 (12). GLUT-1 ranges from 45 to 55 kDa; the size variation depends upon the extent of glycosylation (12).
While GLUT-1 is found in most mammalian cells, certain tissue types express this transporter more so than others. GLUT-1 is expressed in high levels on erythrocytes, embryonic cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (12). GLUT-1 is also one of the main transporters involved in transporting glucose across the blood brain barrier (12).
Generally, GLUT-1 acts as a facilitative transporter of glucose, transporter glucose along its concentration gradient. When glucose binds to GLUT-1, it stimulates a conformational change, allowing glucose to be released on the opposite side of the membrane (4,12). GLUT-1 is a bidirectional transporter and possesses glucose binding sites accessible on both the cytoplasmic and extracellular faces (4,12). On the rare occasion that GLUT-1 transports glucose against its concentration gradient, Glut-1 uses an energy source, typically ATP, to move the glucose. Like GalP, GLUT-1 is inhibited via the binding of cytochalasin B and forskolin (12).

First (song)

"First" is a pop rock song recorded by American singer Lindsay Lohan for her debut album "Speak". It was released as the album's third and final single on May 10, 2005 (see 2005 in music). The song was released to help promote Lohan's film, "", in which it appears on the soundtrack. The song failed to chart in the United States, but it performed well in other countries such as Taiwan. 
The song is about wanting to come first in her boyfriend's life. The song incorporates high pop punk oriented instrumental sounds, but it also conserves her typical teen pop touch. The song was the least successful single in Lohan's album.
Background.
"First" was written and produced by hit-makers Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks, who would later produce her second album "A Little More Personal (Raw)". The song was recorded in Lohan's trailer on the set of "" in September 2004. She had been recording and filming the movie back-to-back. Kara DioGuardi and Cory Rooney, who wrote and produced Lohan's first single, provided background vocals for the song. 
"Speak", the title track from her album, was originally going to be released as the third single. Angela Robinson, director of "Herbie", looked at Lohan's album to see if she could find a track that could be incorporated in the film. She enjoyed listening to "First" and approached Lohan about it being released as the next single. Even though the song is about wanting to be the first person in a boyfriends life, in the context of the film, however, it is taken as wanting to finish first in a car race.
Reception.
Critical reception.
Stylus Magazine called the song and the second track "promising", while criticizing the other songs on the album. The song was noted for its ending line in the chorus: "I wanna come first." Some bloggers have interpreted the meaning of the song as Lohan announcing, in a double entendre to adult listeners, that she wanted to orgasm before her male partners during sex. However, when asked by David Letterman whether this was the case, she smiled slyly and said, "I actually prefer coming at the same time."
Commercial reception.
The single was released on June 25, 2005 in North America and on August 8 in Europe. The song failed to chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100 or the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. It was, however, successful in many other countries. The song charted in the top 10 in Taiwan and Indonesia. The song charted at #31 in Australia, just missing out by one spot on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart. 
It also charted at #41 on the Swiss Singles Top 100 in Switzerland and at #74 in the Media Control Charts.
Promotion.
Lohan performed the song at KIIS-FM 102.7 Wango Tango event in 2005. She also performed the title song from the album, "Speak". 
Music video.
The music video began shooting in May 2005, after Lohan had recently bleached her auburn hair blonde. The music video was directed by Jake Nava, who directed her previous singles "Rumors" and "Over". The video takes place in a garage-like arena in the middle of a race. Lohan and her band sing the song from a stage right next to the track, while clips from "" play. Lohan also sings and dances beside Herbie, the anthropomorphic Volkswagen Beetle.

Life in a Day (album)

Life in a Day is the debut album by Simple Minds, released in 1979. It reached number 30 in the UK Albums Chart. The title track and "Chelsea Girl" were issued as singles.
History.
The band's first album, "Life in a Day", was produced by John Leckie and released by Arista on 5 May 1979 in the UK, spending six weeks in the UK LP charts and reaching number 30. The title track was released on 12 May as Simple Minds' first single and reached No. 62 in the UK Gallup charts, spending two weeks there. However, the next single ("Chelsea Girl") failed to chart at all. A tribute to Nico and the Andy Warhol film "Chelsea Girls", it was a popular live song for the band.
Reception.
Andy Kellman of Allmusic rated the album the lowliest of Simple Minds' first five album releases, remarking on its derivativeness from Magazine and Roxy Music, and ranked "Someone" as the best and "Pleasantly Disturbed" as the worst track. "NME"'s Tony Stewart praised the lyrics and arrangements despite noting the overt influences of 1970s music, and rated "Murder Story" the standout track. Although noting the album as overproduced and undermining the band's sound, he rated the album favourably.
In a 2012 interview, the band's frontman Jim Kerr has expressed regret that the album's production had resulted in the tracks lacking "a real spark" that was part of their live performances, and described his feelings about the album as "bittersweet". He recalled at the time, " as we were about to drive up to Scotland, someone gave me a cassette of "Unknown Pleasures" by Joy Division... and I thought, we've completely blown it."—ruing that their live material had sounded more like Velvet Underground and less like the Boomtown Rats.

Taming the Star Runner

Taming the Star Runner (1988) is a young adult coming-of-age novel written by S. E. Hinton, author of "The Outsiders". Unlike her previous young adult novels, this novel has not been made into a film yet.
Context.
The novel is the last of her series of novels that take place in and around her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma (see Continuity within S.E. Hinton Novels) and the only one of that series written in the third-person perspective.This is also S.E. Hinton's only novel that was not made into a movie. Like her first book, "The Outsiders", it is implied at the end of the book that the protagonist is the actual author. In reality, many of Travis' experiences trying to publish his book parallel those of S.E. Hinton's while trying to publish her first book (having to clean up the language, starting a second book before the first is published, being only 16) It could also be that Travis' book is deliberately similar to Hinton's first book, as it is stated that a major plot point of his book is a title character(the Star Runner) dying in a car accident, similar to Johnny in "The Outsiders" dying due to injuries sustained in a fire.
Plot introduction.
A spirited horse of the title is a type that the main character identifies with towards the end of the novel. It is the story of Travis Harris, a tough sixteen year old child from a big city who must go to live with his paternal uncle after assaulting his stepfather in a fit of rage with a fire poker.
Plot summary.
Travis is a tough kid living in a big city. When he comes home to find his stepfather cramming the fireplace with his writing, Travis assaults him with a fireplace poker. As a result, he is sent to live with his paternal uncle, Ken, on his ranch outside of Tulsa. Travis, used to life in the city, soon finds country life to be boring. Formerly the coolest, toughest kid in school, he is now an out-of-place loner, torn between his desire to fit in and his contempt for country living. Even Ken seems too busy for him, between work at his law-firm and his divorce; he is often too busy to even keep food in the house. Travis continues work on his book while maintaining a correspondence with Joe, the only one of his friends to even occasionally write back.
He also meets Casey Kencaide, who runs a riding school on Ken's ranch and is the only one brave enough to ride the Star Runner, a creature who, like Travis, was never meant to be tamed. Soon Travis is working for Casey as a stable boy, and he receives an offer to publish his book. In response he takes a trip into town to celebrate. While in town he gets drunk and is beat up by the bouncer when his true age is discovered. In bad shape, he contacts his uncle to bring him home and reveals his book deal to Ken, a surprise for Ken, as he was unaware that Travis was even fully literate.
For a while life, to Travis, at least seems bearable. Things soon get worse though, as Travis' stepfather refuses to allow the book to be published without his prior approval. Hearing this, Travis has another fit of rage and throws the phone, nearly hitting Ken's wife, Teresa, and their son, Christopher. Teresa, in response to this, and discovering Travis' criminal record, threatens to use his presence in Ken's house to win full custody of Christopher and Ken almost kicks Travis out in his zeal to be with his son. Eventually they make peace after they realize that they both hoped that the other would be the father and son they were looking for. It turns out Travis' father died in the Vietnam War two months before Travis was born. Ken then agrees to help Travis get his book published, going with him to meet the publisher Ms. Carmichael when she comes to town, and even arranges some publicity with a TV interview at a station owned by a friend of his. 
Travis then gets a surprise visit from his friend Joe, who had hitchhiked his way there. Instead of this being a joyous event, Joe reveals that after Travis left, his friends, Joe and the twins, Billy and Mike, had turned to burglary, fencing the goods through a man named Orson. After Joe quit, the twins continued their burglaries, but found a new fence. For this, Orson killed the twins and tried to make Joe help him. Travis and Ken convince Joe that he must return to face trial as an accomplice, and take him to the local police for extradition.
As they return to Ken's ranch, a huge lightning storm strikes and Ken and Travis must go help Casey round up the horses into the barn. As they do this, the Star Runner breaks free of his padlock. Casey and Travis give chase only to have Casey's jeep struck by lightning. Although it is not directly stated, the Star Runner is killed(This is implied from Travis smelling burned flesh).
The book ends as Casey and Travis have recovered from the accident and the temporary hearing loss. Though Casey had previously spurned Travis' romantic overtures, they are now close friends who share a common bond. Travis also realizes that he, like the Star Runner, should never allow himself to be tamed or broken, even when life is at its worst

The Galp Energia Group is a Portuguese corporation which consists of more than 100 companies engaged in activities such as natural gas supply, regasification, transport, storage, and distribution; petroleum products exploration, production, refining, trading, logistics and retailing; co-generation and renewable energy. Its stock was partially listed on the Euronext Lisbon stock exchange in the second half of 2006.
History.
SACOR, CIDLA, SONAP, PETROSUL, and PETROGAL were the main Portuguese companies from where current-day GALP was born.
SACOR was one of the first Portuguese oil companies. In 1954, SACOR's activities extended to Portugal's overseas territories; 80% of the gasoline, kerosene, and gasoil transported into the Portuguese overseas province of Angola had to be refined on continental Portugal's territory.
The Portuguese discovered oil in their overseas province of Angola in the 1950s. Portuguese-run Sociedade de Lubrificantes e Combustiveis (ANGOL) was set up in 1953 in Portuguese Angola. By the 1960s, it was also participating in the exploration for hydrocarbons. In 1957, SACOR participated in the establishment of another oil company, MOÇACOR, in the Portuguese overseas province of Mozambique.
After the Carnation Revolution military coup in 1974, Portugal handed over power to its overseas provinces. In Portugal, PETROGAL was formed in April 1976 from four Portuguese companies —SACOR, CIDLA, SONAP, and PETROSUL — that were nationalized following the revolution of April 1974. Galp Energia's initial public offering on the Lisbon Stock Exchange took place in 2006.

Miracle Mile (race)

The Miracle Mile is an Australian harness racing event that was held at Harold Park Racetrack each November until 2008 when the race was switched to Menangle Park Paceway. Prize money has long been among that of Australia’s leading harness races and has often included bonuses for speed.
Race history.
The race was held twice in 1986 due to a change of dates from January to November/December, and again in 1996 due to the postponement of the 1995 race caused by track redesign and construction. When the new track opened in 1996 the race distance was changed from one mile (1609m ) to 1760m. The 2007 running was abandoned due to the Equine Influenza outbreak. The 2012 race was also delayed until April of 2013 due to renovations.
Since 2009, the race has been run at Menangle Park, once again at the metric mile distance. The 1400m track length and improved design allowed for faster times. The first winner at the new circuit was New Zealander Monkey King in a track record time of 1:50.8. In 2010 Victorian pacer Smoken Up, who ran 2nd the previous year, won the race and broke the Australasian record in at time of 1:50.3 (Smoken Up has subsequently lowered that record to 1:48.5 in the Len Smith Mile, also at Menangle).
The fastest ‘miles’ at Harold Park were 1:55.6 by Westburn Grant in 1990, 1:56.1 by Master Mood and 1:56.2 by Chokin. When the race distance became 1760 metres the fastest mile rates were 1:54.2 by Iraklis and 1:54.4 by Christian Cullen.
The Miracle Mile proved elusive to legendary reinsman Brian Hancock who trained one winner in Our Sir Vancelot but due to suspension was unable to drive the three-times Inter Dominion champion on the night of his win in 1997. As set out below there have been several dual winners of the flying mile - notably Smoken Up, Be Good Johnny, Sokyola, Holmes DG, Chokin, Westburn Grant and Village Kid. Champion drivers Lance Justice, Vic Frost and Tony Herlihy have won the race three times each. Kellie Kersley became the first female driver to win the race in 1996. The oldest horse to win the race was 12 year-old Double Agent.

Graham Fraser (born 1946 in Ottawa, Ontario) is Canada's sixth Commissioner of Official Languages, and a former Canadian journalist and writer. He is the author of several books, both in English and French, and served as the National Affairs Correspondent for the "Toronto Star", for which he also wrote a weekly column. He was also an adjunct professor of journalism at Carleton University from 2003-2008.
Fraser is the son of Blair Fraser, a respected newspaper and magazine reporter of the mid-20th century. Blair Fraser drowned on a canoe trip in 1968. Graham Fraser attended Upper Canada College and, later, studied at the University of Toronto where he obtained a BA in 1968 and an MA in History in 1973. During his career as a journalist, Fraser wrote for "Maclean's", "The Globe and Mail", "The Montreal Gazette", "The Toronto Star" and "Le Devoir".
Fraser's unusual abilities as a journalist writing in both of Canada's official languages gave him natural qualifications to be Canada's Commissioner of Official Languages. In early 2006 he published a book, "Sorry, I Don't Speak French", which reviewed the successes and failures of Canada's policy of official bilingualism. It was largely on the basis of the book and of Fraser's bilingual work experience that Prime Minister Stephen Harper nominated Fraser to be Canada's next Commissioner of Official Languages in September 2006. The nomination was unanimously endorsed by the House of Commons on October 17.

James Hamilton Ross

James Hamilton Ross (May 12, 1856 – December 14, 1932) was a Canadian politician, the Yukon Territory's third Commissioner, and an ardent defender of territorial rights. He is also considered to be the first resident of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.
Early life.
On January 2, 1882, Ross, a western Canadian rancher born in London, Canada West, and four other men were scouting the location for the Canadian Pacific Railway divisional point when they became the first residents of the modern-day town of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. 
Four days later, Ross established a homestead on the site, becoming the town's first permanent resident.
Territorial political career.
Soon after, Ross became an active participant in territorial government. He continuously campaigned for responsible government and was active in the negotiations to create the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. 
Ross sat in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories between 1883 and 1901, and was Speaker from 1891 to 1894 and a member of the Executive Council between 1895 and 1897. Ross also served as treasurer and then became the Commissioner of the Yukon Territory on March 11, 1901, becoming the first Yukon Commissioner to reside in Government House in Dawson City.

Magic's Promise

"Magic's Promise" is the second fantasy novel in the "The Last Herald Mage" Trilogy by Mercedes Lackey and published in 1992.
Plot introduction.
In this book Vanyel solves a murder mystery which is being pinned on one of his fellow Heralds, young Prince Tashir.
Plot summary.
The book opens with Herald-Mage Vanyel returning to his country Valdemar from an extensive campaign along the border with Karse, the neighboring enemy country. He checks in with Valdemar's King Randale and his lifebonded mate, Shavri, and their daughter Jisa. Only a select few know that Jisa is Vanyel's daughter. Because King Randale is sterile, he had asked Vanyel to father an heir. Now, Shavri confides in Vanyel her fear that Randale is mortally ill.
Vanyel and his mentor Savil return to Vanyel's family home at Forst Reach, where they find little rest or peace. His parents both try to change his mind about being "shay'a'chern", or homosexual. Vanyel becomes somewhat confused about his own sexuality. He wonders if he is truly in love with Shavri. Yfandes, Vanyel's Companion, doesn't buy it and finds the situation amusing.
Vanyel also meets his illegitimate nephew, Medren. Medren is small for his age as Vanyel was, and like him it appears that he is often bullied by the armsmaster Jervis. The boy has a powerful Bardic gift, and Vanyel sponsors him for the Bardic Collegium.
Vanyel confronts Jervis and learns that the armsmaster is not being intentionally rough. He also apologizes for beating Vanyel long ago, and explains his difficult position with Vanyel's father. He also mentions that he knew Vanyel was "shay'a'chern" from the beginning, but also knew from his army service that being gay does not keep men from being courageous warriors. Vanyel accepts this and they form an uneasy friendship.
The main plot focuses on how Vanyel assists young Prince Tashir Remoerdis. Vanyel and Yandes receive a psychic summons into the neighboring country of Lineas. Upon arrival, they find Tashir, who has just become a Herald, with his Companion, Leshya (nicknamed Ghost by Yfandes). Another Herald, Lores, is beating the child and attacks Ghost when he tries to interfere. He believes that Tashir is actually an evil sorcerer who has murdered his own family. Vanyel immediately stops Lores and commands him to return to Valdemar.
Vanyel takes Tashir back to his own home, Forst Reach, and begins to try and discover what truly happened to Tashir's family. He then returns to Lineas, disguised as a minstrel to gather information. In Lineas magic is taboo; no one is supposed to perform it for any reason. It shares a border with Baires, a country ruled by the Mavelan, a family of mages. A treaty was signed to end the warring between the two countries, sealed by the marriage of Tashir's parents. In the treaty there exists a clause that if the royal family of Lineas dies out, the Mavelan can take over the Lineas throne, and vice versa.
Vanyel meets an old servant of the Remoerdis family who tells him of Tashir's sad childhood. Tashir was physically and emotionally abused by his father and sexually abused by his mother. His mother was mentally unstable and made seductive overtures to Tashir even as a young child. Tashir looks very much like his mother's uncle Vedric, and rumor has it that he is the product of an incestuous affair between them.
Returning to Forst Reach, Vanyel recruits Savil and Jervis to help. Together with Tashir, they return to Lineas, breaking through the palace's magic shields to search the place. They find a secret room which contains a "heart-stone", an ordinary rock connected with a magical "node" which is keeping a deep, dangerous fault sealed. As the stone was unstable and any magic done in the area could disturb it, a guardian family without magic was appointed. If the stone were to be removed, a giant earthquake would occur destroying Lineas, parts of the outlands, and the border of Valdemar. That was why magic was anathema in Lineas, and also why everyone in the palace was blood related member of the Remoerdis family, sworn to protect the node.
In the palace Vanyel and Savil discover a "trap-spell", which targets one person and also kills the target's entire family. Tashir's family were the victims of the trap-spell, which was placed by Tashir's uncle Vedric, whose intention is to control both Lineas and Baires. (He is not, however, Tashir's father.) Vedric tries the same trick on Vanyel, who has already caught on and sent Savil away, along with Tashir, while keeping Jervis with him. In defending himself, Vanyel ends up killing most of the Baires family as well as Vedric.
Now king of both Baires and Lineas, Tashir considers himself too young and inexperienced. He allows King Randale to annex the two smaller countries into Valdemar. Vanyel finally sorts out that he actually is gay, and that Shavri is just a good friend.

Roche Braziliano

Roche Braziliano (sometimes spelled "Rock", "Roch", "Roc", "Roque", "Brazilliano", or "Brasiliano") (c. 1630 – disappeared c. 1671) was a Dutch pirate born in the town of Groningen. His pirate career lasted from 1654 until his disappearance around 1671. He was first eternalized in Alexandre Exquemelin's 1678 book "The Buccaneers of America"; Exquemelin did not know Braziliano's real name, but historians have found he was probably born as Gerrit Gerritszoon and that he and his parents moved to Dutch-controlled Brazil. He is known as "Roche Braziliano", which in English translates to "Rock the Brazilian", due to his long exile in Brazil.
Pirate career.
Roche Braziliano was a notoriously cruel buccaneer who operated out of Port Royal, Jamaica. He was a privateer in Bahia, Brazil, before moving to Port Royal in 1654. He led a mutiny and adopted the life of a buccaneer. On his first adventure he captured a ship of immense value and brought it back safely to Jamaica. He eventually was caught and sent to Spain, but he escaped with threats of vengeance from his followers. He soon resumed his criminal career, purchasing a new ship from fellow pirate François l'Olonnais and later sailing in company with Sir Henry Morgan among others.
Atrocities.
Drunken and debauched, Braziliano would threaten to shoot anyone who did not drink with him. He roasted alive two Spanish farmers on wooden spits after they refused to hand over their pigs. He treated his Spanish prisoners barbarously, typically cutting off their limbs or roasting them alive over a fire.
Fate.
After 1671, Braziliano was never seen or heard from again. Even to this date, nobody knows what became of the Dutch pirate. Whether he (and his vessel and men) were lost at sea in a brutal storm, was secretly captured, or possibly retired and lived the rest of his life in anonymity is a matter of debate.

Trinity Abbey, Vendôme

Trinity Abbey, Vendôme, was a Benedictine monastery founded in 1035 in Vendôme by Geoffrey Martel and his first wife, Agnes of Burgundy. It was consecrated on 31 May 1040, one month before Geoffrey became Count of Anjou.
The abbey was under the direct authority of the Pope and nobody else. This fact was accepted by Thierry of Chartres and by King Henry I of France in 1056. In 1063, its abbot was given the rights of being a cardinal. It was often in conflict with the counts of Vendôme and some, like Geoffrey Jordan, were excommunicated.
In the 17th century, Vendôme was part of the Maurist congregation. One of the most famous Maurists, Luc d'Achery, was professed in Vendôme.
The cloister buildings were substantially demolished by the military users at the onset of the twentieth century, but what remains houses a small museum devoted to the Vendômois. The monastery manuscripts are mainly conserved at the town library. The church until recently functioned for one midweek mass.

The Wonderful Tune

The Wonderful Tune is an Irish fairy tale collected in "Fairy Tales and Traditions of the South of Ireland". Andrew Lang included it in "The Lilac Fairy Book".
Ruth Manning-Sanders included it, as "The Magical Tune", in "A Book of Mermaids".
Synopsis.
Maurice Connor, a blind man, was the finest piper in Munster, and knew a tune that when he played, it forced everyone to dance. One day at a wedding by the sea, he drank a great deal of whiskey, and foolishly began to play that tune. Everyone, and every creature down to the crabs, scallops and oysters, began to dance. A mermaid came dancing up out of the sea and persuaded him to marry her and live in the sea. He promised his old mother to send, every year, a piece of burned wood to Trafraska to show he was alive and well. 
His mother died soon after the wedding, but the piece of burned wood drifted ashore every year for more than a century.

Real to Real Cacophony

Real to Real Cacophony (sometimes incorrectly rendered as Reel to Real Cacophony) is the second studio album by Scottish post-punk band Simple Minds. It was released in November 1979, through record labels Zoom and Arista.
Release.
"Real to Real Cacophony" did not chart, nor did its only single, "Changeling".
Critical reception.
"Real to Real Cacophony" has been generally well-received by critics. AllMusic praised the album, describing it as "where Simple Minds ventured beyond the ability to mimic their influences and began to manipulate them, mercilessly pushing them around and shaping them into funny objects the way a child transforms a chunk of Play-Doh from an indefinable chunk of nothing into a definable chunk of something", calling it "an achievement that's on a plane with other 1979 post-punk landmarks like "Metal Box", "154", "Entertainment!" and "Unknown Pleasures"".
Re-issues.
The 2002/2003 re-issues by Virgin Records incorrectly render the album's title as "Reel to Real Cacophony", and the opening track as "Reel to Real". The new spelling also appears in the discography section of all the inlays in the 2002/2003 Simple Minds remastered edition series. Subsequent editions render the title of both the album and track correctly.

Texas State Highway 110

State Highway 110 or SH 110 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that runs from Grand Saline to Rusk. 
Route description.
SH 110 begins at an intersection with US 84 and Loop 62 in downtown Rusk and leaves the courthouse square north with US 84, crossing US 69 on its way to a split on the northeast side of Rusk where US 84 goes off east and SH 110 turns north, out of town. The road passes Ponta and New Summerfield before crossing the county line into Smith County as it enters Troup. After a brief downtown multiplex with SH 135, SH 110 leaves Troup going northwest through Whitehouse on its way to Tyler. SH 110 swings around the downtown area to the south and west by way of multiplexes with SH 64, SH 155, and US 69. After splitting with US 69, SH 110 leaves Tyler toward the northwest. After several miles, SH 110 crosses I-20 south of Garden Valley. Just after Garden Valley, the road multiplexes with FM 16 and goes west into Van Zandt County. SH 110 splits with FM 16 in Van and turns back north. Approaching Grand Saline, SH 110 merges with FM 17 and travels the remaining several blocks multiplexed until it reaches US 80, the northern terminus of SH 110.
History.
SH 110 was originally numbered in 1926 on a route from SH 26 north of Nacogdoches northwest to Sacul. This was a renumbering of a former portion of SH 40, which was rerouted southward from Jacksonville in the 1926 plans. By 1933, the route had been extended to include a route from Rusk northward to Tyler, along with its original route and a planned connection at New Summerfield. By 1936, the original portion had been renumbered as SH 204, leaving the routing from Rusk to Tyler, and an extension northwest to Grand Saline, completing its current routing. A section northward to Alba was added in 1940, but was transferred to FM 17.

USS Zahma (IX-63)

USS "Zahma" (IX-63), an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be given that name. A wooden-hulled ketch with an auxiliary engine, she was designed by Bowdoin B. Crowninshield and completed in 1915 at Neponset, Massachusetts, by George Lawley & Son, for John H. Cromwell of Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, New York. Inspected by the Navy at the entry of the United States into World War I for possible service as a patrol craft, the vessel was rejected as "unsuitable for naval use."
A quarter of a century later, the exigencies of war changed the Navy's evaluation of the graceful craft, as she was again inspected, this time at the 11th Naval District, in early 1942. Acquired by the Port Director of San Diego, California, from R. J. Rheem on 13 February, "Zahma" was placed in service on 26 February 1942. Classified as an unclassified miscellaneous vessel and designated IX-63, "Zahma" was based at San Diego and operated as a local patrol craft into the spring of 1943. Placed out of service on 13 April 1943, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 18 July 1944.

Pete Cosey

Pete Cosey (born Peter Palus Cosey, October 9, 1943 – May 30, 2012) was an American guitarist most famous for playing with Miles Davis' band between 1973 and 1975. His fiercely flanged and distorted guitar bore comparisons to Jimi Hendrix. Cosey kept a low profile for much of his career and released no solo recorded works. His unique guitar rhythms were showcased on Davis' albums "Get Up with It" (1974), "Dark Magus" (1977), "Agharta" (1975), "Pangaea" (1976), and "The Complete On the Corner Sessions" (2007).
Biography.
Early life.
Cosey was born in Chicago, Illinois. Both of his parents were musicians, and Cosey began his musical training on violin before starting grammar school. Following the death of his father, Cosey and his mother moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where he spent his teenage years and began developing his guitar style.
Early career.
Prior to joining the Miles Davis band in 1973, Cosey was a busy session guitarist with Chess Records, playing on records by Etta James, Fontella Bass ("Rescue Me"), Rotary Connection, Howlin' Wolf ("The Howlin' Wolf Album") and Muddy Waters ("Electric Mud", "After the Rain").
Cosey was also an early member of Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). He was an early member of the Pharaohs, and a group with drummer Maurice White and bassist Louis Satterfield that eventually evolved into Earth, Wind & Fire. Some of his pre-Miles jazz playing is available on albums by Phil Cohran's Artistic Heritage Ensemble.
After joining Davis, Cosey performed on the albums "Get Up with It", "Dark Magus", "Agharta" and "Pangaea". By 1975, Cosey had developed a remarkably advanced guitar approach—involving numerous alternate tunings, guitars restrung in unusual patterns and a post-Hendrix palette of distortion, wah-wah and guitar synth effects—that has influenced many adventurous guitarists, including Henry Kaiser and Vernon Reid.
Following the 1975 break-up of the Miles Davis band, Cosey largely disappeared from public view. He played on the title track of Herbie Hancock's "Future Shock" album, but did not appear on record again until Akira Sakata's album "Fisherman's.com" (with Sakata, Bill Laswell and Hamid Drake) in 2000. Throughout the '80s, he was involved in a number of Chicago- and New York-based groups with various musicians, but no recordings have been released. In 1987, he replaced Bill Frisell in the trio Power Tools with bassist Melvin Gibbs and drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson (a live recording is available through RSJ's website).
2000s.
In 2001, he started a group called Children of Agharta to explore the electric Miles Davis repertoire. The first line-up was Cosey, Gary Bartz, John Stubblefield, Matt Rubano, J. T. Lewis, and DJ Johnny Juice Rosado (studio DJ for Public Enemy). The group's booking agency was listing the band as a quartet of Cosey, Bartz, Melvin Gibbs and Doni Hagen.
In 2003, Cosey appeared on an episode of American television's "The People's Court", successfully suing a promoter for failing to pay fully for a Children of Agharta gig.
Cosey was also a featured soloist with the group Burnt Sugar on their album "The Rites".
In 2004, Cosey appeared in the "Godfathers and Sons" episode of Martin Scorsese's documentary series "The Blues". The episode followed Marshall Chess and Chuck D (of Public Enemy) reuniting the musicians from Muddy Waters' "Electric Mud" album to record a new track.
In July 2006, Cosey was fleetingly glimpsed during the finale of Bill Laswell's PBS Soundstage concert (his performance having been edited out of the broadcast).
In 2003, Cosey scored a short film, directed by Eli Mavros, entitled "Alone Together". Cosey and Mavros had met the previous year during production of Mark Levin's episode for the PBS Blues series. After appearing on Eli's college blues radio show, Shake Em On Down, on New York University's radio station, 89.1 FM WNYU, he agreed to score the film. In the spirit of jazz and spontaneity, the soundtrack to the film was improvised by Cosey in real time over several takes, with several different instruments; no two takes were the same. He played guitar (using several distortion pedals, often bowing the strings like a violin), African thumb piano, and a zither given to him by Miles Davis. The film went on to show at several small film festivals.
From September through October 2007, Pete Cosey briefly appeared playing his guitar (no sound, due to narrative voiceover) in two scenes of a national thirty-second television commercial for AARP's Senior Advantage Complete Care Healthcare Insurance.
In 2007-08, Cosey contributed to the CD "Miles from India", which celebrates the music of Miles Davis. It features many former Miles sidemen and Indian musicians, with Cosey playing on five tracks: "Ife (Fast)", "It's About That Time", "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down", "Great Expectations", and "Ife (Slow)".
Death.
Pete Cosey died on May 30, 2012 of complications following surgery at Vanguard Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Although he had spent most of his life in Chicago, he had been living in Evanston, Illinois. He is survived by five children and six grandchildren.

<doc id="5969717" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5969717" title="Empires and Dance">
Empires and Dance

Empires and Dance is the third studio album by Scottish new wave band Simple Minds. It was recorded in Wales, on the Rolling Stones mobile, and released on 27 September 1980, through record label Arista.
Release.
"Empires and Dance" charted poorly, peaking at only number 41 in the UK Albums Chart. According to the Allmusic review of the album, this is primarily because the record company Arista only released a small number of copies at a time before each batch sold out. This had the effect of limited availability for fans.
The opening track "I Travel" was released as a single in 1980, but failed to chart. "Celebrate" was chosen as the second single due to popularity amongst fans. However, it was only released after Simple Minds had left the label. As a result the single sold very poorly, and the picture sleeve 7" is amongst the hardest of the band's singles to find.
Following the release of this album, Simple Minds transferred to Virgin Records, where they met with much greater commercial success. Arista tried to capitalize on this success by re-releasing "I Travel" as a single in 1982, along with a compilation "Celebration". In 1983, Virgin rereleased "I Travel" on 12", to coincide with the acquisition of the band's Arista catalogue. Both times, it still failed to chart.
Critical reception.
"Empires and Dance" has been generally well-received critically.
"NME" called it as "a weird, agitating record". AllMusic described the album as a "post-punk dance classic".
Legacy.
The album cover's typeface was emulated for the cover of Manic Street Preachers' third album "The Holy Bible"..

Brenda Brathwaite

Brenda Louise Romero (née Garno, born October 12, 1966), previously known as Brenda Brathwaite, is an American game designer and developer in the video game industry. Born in Ogdensburg, New York, and a graduate of Clarkson University, Romero is best known for her work on the "Wizardry" series of role-playing video games and, more recently, the non-digital series "The Mechanic is the Message". She has worked in game development since 1981 and has credits on 22 game titles.
For "Wizardry", Romero provided game design, level design, system design, writing and scripting. She also wrote the manuals and documentation for some products in the series. Romero provided writing and documentation for the award-winning "Jagged Alliance" series. She also worked on other notable franchises including games such as ', ', "", and others.
Career.
Romero began her career in 1981 at video game developer and publisher Sir-tech Software, Inc., on the "Wizardry" role-playing team. She worked first as a tester, and moved up through the design and content creation ranks to lead designer for the award-winning series. While at Sir-tech, Romero also worked on the "Jagged Alliance" and "Realms of Arkania" series. She was employed with Sir-tech for 18 years before moving on to game maker Atari where she worked on the "Dungeons & Dragons" series for consoles before joining Cyberlore Studios in 2003 to work on the "" game. Romero's research for the game was ultimately published in a book, "Sex in Video Games".
In 2006, Romero was named one of the 100 most influential women in the game industry by "Next Generation" magazine and her peers. "Nerve" magazine cited her as a "New Radical" — one of "the 50 artists, actors, authors, activists and icons who are making the world a more stimulating place". In 2009, "Next Generation" magazine identified her as the woman with the longest continuous service in video game development.
Romero served as Chair of the Savannah College of Art and Design's Interactive Design and Game Development department until November 2009. She moved to San Francisco to consult as Creative Director for social media company Slide, Inc., and then became Creative Director of social gaming company Lolapps, Inc. in May 2010. She co-founded the social game company Loot Drop with John Romero in November 2010, then left Lolapps and joined Loot Drop in February 2011. In 2013, Romero became the first game designer in residence at the Games and Playable Media Program of the University of California at Santa Cruz. She also serves as the program's director.
Personal life.
Romero married game developer John Romero on October 27, 2012. Together, they worked on "Ravenwood Fair", with John as lead designer and Brenda as creative director and game designer. John and Brenda became engaged on March 24, 2012. Brenda has three children from a previous marriage: Maezza, born in 2001, and twins Avalon and Donovan, born in 2004.
IGDA and activism.
Romero was an active member of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA). In 2008, she was elected to the IGDA's Board of Directors. On March 28, 2013, she resigned as co-chair of the IGDA Women in Games SIG in protest over an incident in which scantily-clad women performed for a party co-sponsored by IGDA and yetizen, since she felt that the performance conflicted with IDGA's support for the advancement of female game authors and designers.
She founded the International Game Developers Sex Special Interest Group (Sex SIG) in 2005.
Since working on "Playboy", she has studied adult and sexual content in video games and is regularly interviewed about the subject in the media.
She has written a book on the subject, "Sex in Video Games".
She is an anti-censorship activist and a proponent of parental rating awareness.
Academics.
She is a regular speaker at universities and conferences including the Game Developers Conference, Austin Game Developers Conference, and Montreal International Games Summit. Some of her lectures have been held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, The Guildhall at Southern Methodist University, and Clarkson University.
In the spring of 2007, she was awarded the Presidential Fellowship at Savannah College of Art and Design to develop an exhibit and presentation titled, "What You Don't Know About Video Games...". In April 2008, Romero became Chair of the Interactive Design and Game Development department at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). Brathwaite left SCAD in November 2009 to return to full-time commercial game development.
In December 2012, she was appointed "Game Designer in Residence" at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
In March 2014, she was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship.
"Mechanic is the Message".
In February 2008, Romero began work on a series of non-digital games known collectively as "The Mechanic is the Message". According to the series abstract, 
""The Mechanic is the Message" captures and expresses difficult experiences through the medium of a game. Much like photographs, paintings, literature and music are capable of transmitting the full range of the human experience from one human to another, so too can games. Due to their interactivity, the installation suggests that games are capable of a higher form of communication, one which actively engages the participant and makes them a part of the experience rather than a passive observer."
The series is composed of six separate non-digital games that experiment with the traditional notions of games.
Of the six, "Train" has received the most attention, and won the Vanguard Award at Indiecade in October 2009 for "pushing the boundaries of game design and showing us what games can do." Train was also featured in the Wall Street Journal as well as on game industry sites including Gamasutra where it received accolades for its ability to evoke meaning through gestures, the Escapist Magazine, Extra Credits, and on Kotaku. Romero delivered Train: How I Dumped Electricity and Learned to Love Design at the 2010 Gamesauce Conference.
"Síochán leat" (Gaelic for "peace be with you") chronicles the history of her children's heritage. Romero made the game following "The New World", a game she originally made to teach her daughter about the slave trade. Romero designed "Síochán leat" to teach her daughter about her Irish heritage and traces the family's history from the Cromwellian invasion of Ireland to their ancestor's eventual immigration into the West Indies on the paternal side and Canada on the maternal side. The game features a burlap pillow simulating an earthen mound covered by 26 pieces of grass, each representing a county in Ireland. In a talk given at the Austin Game Developers Conference in September 2009, Romero noted that the burlap was filled with mementos of her upbringing and her heritage, including photographs of her great grandfather, Paddy Donovan, and one of her mother's rosaries. On her blog, Romero notes that "the game is signed in many ways and is highly autobiographical. It is my history and it also reveals my feelings about its present state."

Eineik Kaddabeen

Einek Kaddabeen is the tenth studio album by Lebanese recording artist Nawal Al Zoghbi, released on May 22, 2004 worldwide.
This album is one of Nawal's best selling albums and marks a shift in Nawal's career as the singer leaves Rotana, after many issues with distribution and release, and joins Alam Al Phan for a ten-year contract. However, Nawal left the label four years later due to numerous conflicts with Mohsen Jaber, the founder of Alam Al Phan.
With many issues accompanying its release, "Einek Kaddabeen" spawned only two singles, both reaching number one around the Arab World. The title track served as the lead single and was followed by a controversial release of the album's fourth track, "Bi Enak," the video of which was directed by Nadine Labaki, along with many rumors that ended up with Nawal deciding to take a break from music and head back to studio to record a new album, leaving many popular tracks from the album unreleased. However, TV channels like Mazzika and Melody Group aired live performances of tracks including "Malleit" and "Tegma'na Essaat."
Singles.
This video shows a woman who suspects her bodyguard likes her, but he doesn't show his feelings to her. They share many moments in which her suspicions are confirmed. They get ready to go to a party, and when Nawal goes to his room to call him, he is not there, yet she discovers that he loves her so much that he has many photos of her. She exits the room, leaving her watch on a table. When he later enters his room, he notices the watch and decides to find Nawal and return her watch to her. He goes to the party and tries to find her amongst all the people. In the end, the couple are united on a terrace where he returns to her watch.
Bieinak (You Wish! ) video was Nawal singing on stage in front of her fans at a concert with a Japanese back up dancers in a Japanese style. This video was different, in that members of Nawal's fan club were used in the shooting of this video.

Matteo Goffriller

Matteo Goffriller (1659–1742) was a Venetian luthier, particularly noted for the quality of his cellos.
Although it is known that Goffriller was born in Brixen, little else is known of him prior to his days in Venice, that is before 1685. He was active between 1685–1735 and was the founder of the "Venetian School" of luthiers, during a time when Venice was one of the most important centers of musical activity in the world.
Goffriller's cellos had been erroneously attributed in the past to the Guarneri family, Carlo Bergonzi or even Antonio Stradivari and were virtually unknown until the 1920s, when they began to be discovered. The 1733 Goffriller cello once owned by Pablo Casals was originally attributed to Bergonzi. His earliest authenticated instrument is a viola da gamba dated 1689.
Goffriller arrived in Venice in 1685 to work for luthier Martin Kaiser (Caiser). In 1685 he married Martin Kaiser's daughter Maddalena Maria Kaiser (Caiser), at the Madonna delle Grazie in Venice; she bore him twelve children (five boys and seven girls) in 26 years. Francesco Goffriller, long thought to be his brother, according to recent research actually was his son. He is believed to have taught luthiers Domenico Montagnana and Francesco Gobetti in addition to Francesco, and died in Venice in 1742.
Goffriller labels.
The standard label for a Gofriller instrument, whether genuine or forged, uses the Latin inscription "Mattheus Goffriller Fece in Venezia Anno ", identifying maker, city (Venice) and year made; the date is either printed or handwritten. But he actually labeled only a small percentage of the instruments in order to avoid paying Venetian taxes.
Legacy.
Pablo Casals's Goffriller 1733 cello was his main concert instrument for most of his professional life. He acquired it in 1913 and played it until his death in 1973. Since 2000, winners of the International Pablo Casals Cello Competition in Kronberg, Germany may use it for two years.
Terence Weil played another Goffriller used by Casals before the one he played between 1913 & 1973.
Other notable musicians who have used Goffriller instruments include:

See Clearly Method

The See Clearly Method is an eye exercise program that was marketed as an alternative to the use of glasses, contact lenses, and eye surgery to improve vision. Sales were halted by legal action in 2006. The method is not supported by basic science, and no research studies were conducted prior to marketing. The program is based in part on the Bates method, an alternative therapy devised in the early 20th century which lacks clinical evidence to support the claim that it can improve eyesight.
History.
The See Clearly Method was created by four individuals who called themselves the "American Vision Institute": optometrist David W. Muris, optometrist Merrill J. Allen, psychologist Francis A. Young, and nuclear chemist Steven Beresford. In 1996 they authored a book entitled "Improve Your Vision Without Glasses or Contact Lenses: A New Program of Therapeutic Eye Exercises", on which the later system was based. When Fairfield, Iowa businessman Cliff Rose saw the book, he asked that the authors develop the program. Along with attorney David Sykes, Rose created "Vision Improvement Technologies", which owned and marketed the See Clearly Method, which was heavily advertised on radio and television from 2001 to 2006, with the endorsement of actress Mariette Hartley.
The See Clearly Method has been described as "amply critiqued and debunked."
Both the Journal of the American Optometric Association and the Journal of Behavioral Optometry declined to publish a study by the American Vision Institute purportedly demonstrating the efficacy of the method. The AVI then self-published the paper on their website.
Techniques.
Some of the program's techniques were adapted from the Bates method, a collection of techniques developed by William Bates in the early 20th century. These techniques were based on Bates' own unorthodox theories, which have been consistently rejected and in many cases overturned by the scientific and medical community. There is still no evidence to suggest that the Bates method, in whole or in part, is effective.
Some of the See Clearly Method's techniques are outlined below:
Legal action.
Tom Miller, the Attorney General of Iowa, filed a consumer fraud lawsuit against Vision Improvement Technologies, the promoter of the See Clearly Method, in 2005. In February 2006 an Iowa court issued a temporary injunction restricting certain aspects of the company's marketing. A November 2, 2006 press release from the Iowa Attorney General's office announced a consent decree with Vision Improvement under which the company will halt sales, offer restitution to customers, clear customers' credit records of any filings related to See Clearly purchases, and halt operations as of December 2006.
On December 18th, 2006, the company's web site stated, "As of November 1, 2006 The See Clearly Method is no longer available for sale."

Iona Island (New York)

Iona Island is a 556-acre (2.2 km²) bedrock island, part of the Hudson River nature reserve in Stony Point, New York. It is part of Bear Mountain State Park The island is separated from the Hudson's western shore by mudflats and freshwater tidal marshes. It and its surrounding marsh was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1974 as well as the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve and a Significant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat Area. It serves mainly as a bird sanctuary, particularly known as a winter nesting place for Bald Eagles.
Geography.
Iona Island is transected by active railroad tracks, but is accessible to the public only by a causeway connecting it to U.S. Route 9W in Bear Mountain State Park, near Doodletown. It is maintained by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission. The southeastern part of the island, once cut off by marshes, is known as Round Island. The hill on the western side, south of the causeway, was also once treated as separate, and referred to as Courtland Island. Snake Hole Creek originates in the low marshes towards the center of the island and flows southwesterly, then turning to the southeast and finally east in a long crescent to reach the Hudson. It separates the marshes of Salisbury Meadow, on the west side, from Ring Meadow, on the east side.
History.
It was originally known as Salisbury Island, and later as Weyant's Island (for the local Weyant or Weiant family). In 1847, it was bought by John Beveridge for Dr. E. W. Grant, his great son-in-law, who renamed it Iona Island and planted it with Iona grapes and fruit trees. In 1868, his creditors foreclosed on the island. The construction of the West Shore Railroad across the island in 1882 made it accessible to tourists, and an amusement park, hotel, and picnic grounds were built there. It also had a dock to accommodate pleasure steamers on the river.
In 1900, the island was bought by the U.S. Navy for use as a naval ammunition depot, which remained in service until 1947. It was bought by the Palisades Interstate Park Commission in 1965.
Wildlife.
The island was the subject of a Bioblitz in 2000

<doc id="5969862" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5969862" title="Learjet 35">
Learjet 35

The Learjet Model 35 and Model 36 are a series of American multi-role business jets and military transport aircraft manufactured by Learjet. When used by the United States Air Force they carry the designation C-21A.
The aircraft are powered by two Garrett TFE731-2 turbofan engines. Its cabin can be arranged for 6-8 passengers. The Model 36 has a shortened passenger area in the fuselage, in order to provide more space in the aft fuselage for fuel tanks. It is designed for longer-range mission capability.
The engines are mounted in nacelles on the sides of the aft fuselage. The wings are equipped with single-slotted flaps. The wingtip fuel tanks distinguish the design from other aircraft having similar functions.
Development.
The concept which became the LJ35 began as the Learjet 25BGF (with GF referring to "Garrett Fan"), a Learjet 25 with a then-new TFE731 turbofan engine mounted on the left side in place of the 25's General Electric CJ610 turbojet engine. This testbed aircraft first flew in May, 1971. As a result of the increased power and reduced noise of the new engine, Learjet further improved the design, and instead of being simply a variant of the 25, it became its own model, the 35.
Operational history.
In 1976 American professional golfer Arnold Palmer used a Learjet 36 to establish a new round-the-world class record of 22,894 miles (36990 km) completed in 57 hours 25 minutes 42 seconds.
Learjet 35s made the bulk of Escuadrón Fénix during the 1982 Falklands War mainly on diversion flights.
Production on the 35/36 series ceased in 1994.
As of January, 2007, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board database lists 19 fatal accidents for the 35/35A, and two for the 36/36A.
Variants.
Learjet 35.
The original Model 35 was powered by two TFE731-2-2A engines and was 13 inches longer than its predecessor, the Model 25. First flight of the prototype Model 35 was on 22 August 1973, and the aircraft was FAA certified in July, 1974. It could carry up to eight passengers. There were 64 base-model 35s built.
Learjet 35A.
The Model 35A is an upgraded Model 35 with TFE731-2-2B engines and a range of 2,789 miles, with a fuel capacity of 931 US gallons (3,524 L) with refueling accomplished at ground level through each wingtip tank. It was introduced in 1976, replacing the 35. Over 600 35As were built, with a production line that ended with serial number 677, in 1993.
On February 12, 1996, a Learjet 35A piloted by Mark E. Calkins, Charles Conrad, Jr., Paul Thayer, and Daniel Miller completed an around-the-world flight in record time. The record remains standing as of 2011.
This aircraft is now on display in Terminal C of Denver International Airport.
Military variants.
There are 38 Air Force active duty aircraft, and 18 Air National Guard aircraft in the C-21A fleet. On 1 April 1997, all continental U.S.-based C-21As were realigned under Air Mobility Command, with the 375th Airlift Wing at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, as the lead command. C-21As stationed outside the continental United States are assigned to the theater commanders.
After-Market Modifications.
Raisbeck Engineering offers two after-market modifications to the Learjet 35 and 36 series of aircraft. The Aft Fuselage Locker offered by this company is an external storage container mounted below the rear fuselage that can hold 300 lb of baggage. The addition of the locker imposes no performance penalties on the aircraft. This company also offers the ZR LITE performance improvement package. This modification reduces the cruise drag of the aircraft resulting in 25% less time-to-climb, 3000 to 4000 feet higher initial cruise altitude, .02+ increase in cruise Mach at equal power settings, 1% decrease in N1 and 15° ITT reduction at equal Mach and a 5-10% increase in range.
Avcon Industries also offers two after-market modifications to the Learjet 35 and 36 series of aircraft. The Avcon Fins are delta fins mounted n the aft fuselage, similar to those used on the Learjet 31 which improve directional stability when installed on Lear 35 & 36 models, and eliminate the FAA requirement for operable yaw dampers. The Avcon R/X modifications adds 750 pounds of usable fuel in the tip tanks, which provides up to 40 minutes of additional flight time at normal cruise speeds and altitudes.
Operators.
Civilian operators.
The Learjet 35 is operated by private, corporate and air taxi operators.

Norris Coleman

Norris James Coleman (born September 27, 1961) is a retired American professional basketball player who was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2nd round (38th overall) of the 1987 NBA Draft. A 6'8" forward from Kansas State University, Coleman played in only one NBA season.
Coleman played for the Clippers during the 1987-88 season, appearing in 29 games and scoring a total of 153 points. Following his one season in the NBA, Coleman had a lengthy and successful career in foreign professional basketball leagues, principally in Israel. He played with Hapoel Jerusalem during the 1992-93, 1993–94 and 1995-96 seasons, and with Maccabi Tel Aviv during the 1994-95 season.
Coleman continued to play in Israel in numerous teams until his retirement in 2001, with Hapoel Tel Aviv in the second league, at the age of 40.
College career.
Coleman had an unusual collegiate career at Kansas State. Because he had spent five years in the U.S. Army, Coleman was a 24-year-old freshman when he began play at K-State in the 1985-86 basketball season. That season, Coleman led the Big Eight Conference in scoring with 21.8 points per game and pulled down 8 rebounds a game, on the way to being named first-team All-Conference and Newcomer of the Year. In doing so, he became one of the few players to lead his league in scoring during his first season in college. However, near the close of that season, the NCAA found that Coleman had not met the minimum high school requirements and K-State immediately declared him ineligible.
The saga took another twist in April 1986, when the NCAA issued an unusual ruling that said Coleman would have to sit out a year at K-State with no scholarship and surrender a year of eligibility, or transfer to a different school and face no penalties. Coleman immediately received scholarship offers from 25 schools, and took recruiting trips to LSU, the University of Kentucky and the University of Virginia, but eventually decided to stay at Kansas State. Early in the following basketball season, in November 1986, the NCAA reduced its penalty to a 12-game suspension, and Coleman returned to the court for the last 19 games of the 1986-1987 season, teaming with Mitch Richmond to help lead K-State to a berth in the 1987 NCAA tournament. After averaging 20.7 points per game and 8.4 rebounds per game and again being named first team All-Conference in his shortened sophomore season, Coleman decided to turn pro.
Because of his career in the Army, Coleman was affectionately nicknamed "The Sarge" by Kansas State fans.

USS Triana (IX-223)

USS "Triana" (IX-223), an unclassified miscellaneous vessel, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Rodrigo de Triana, the discoverer of the Americas. Her keel was laid down on 27 December 1943 under Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 2559) as "Elinor Wylie" (T. EC2S-C1) at Los Angeles, California, by the California Shipbuilding Corporation for the McCormick Steamship Lines. She was launched on 24 January 1944 sponsored by Mrs. William O'Brien, renamed "Triana" on 21 May 1945, acquired by the Navy from the War Shipping Administration on a "bare-boat" basis on 24 May 1945, and commissioned at Pearl Harbor the same day with Lieutenant Wyman W. Hodgkins, USNR, in command.
The ship had been severely damaged by an underwater explosion in 1944 and was not considered seaworthy when fully loaded. Nevertheless, during the period 24 May to 29 July, she was patched up, strengthened, and converted into a floating storage ship by the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard.
On 30 July, "Triana" got underway for the Marshall Islands and arrived at Eniwetok on 11 August. One of her holds was consigned to fleet freight, and the remaining cargo space was utilized for drum storage. On 24 September, after the vessel had taken on some 4500 tons of cargo, her Number 2 hold began leaking, and further loading operations were cancelled. The leaks were temporarily stopped, and the ship continued to receive and discharge fleet freight and drum lubricating oil until 30 November.
On 1 December, "Triana" got underway for Guam to unload 8,896 drums of lubricating oil. She arrived at Apra Harbor on 5 December and departed for the United States on 24 December 1945. The cargo ship arrived at San Francisco, California, on 15 January 1946 to prepare for inactivation. "Triana" was decommissioned and returned to the War Shipping Administration on 21 February 1946 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 March 1946.

Widening participation

Widening participation in higher education is a major component of government education policy in the United Kingdom and Europe. It consists of an attempt to increase not only the numbers of young people entering higher education, but also the proportion from under-represented groups (those from lower income families, people with disabilities and some ethnic minorities).
In this way it is hoped to redress the inequalities in participation between social classes. Widening participation is one of the strategic objectives of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE). The issue of widening participation became a political issue after the Laura Spence Affair which hit the headlines in 2000 and after the 2003 University of Bristol admissions row which concerned alleged biases in favour of the state sector.
HEFCE is pursuing this policy through a number of measures, including the payment of financial incentives to universities and by funding the Aimhigher programme.
This policy is linked to the previous Labour government's target of increasing participation in higher education to 50% by 2010.

David B. Barkley

David Bennes Barkley (March 31, 1899 – November 9, 1918), often spelled Barkeley, was a United States Army private who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during World War I in France. After successfully completing a scouting mission behind enemy lines, he drowned as he swam back across the Meuse River.
Biography.
Barkley was born in Laredo in Webb County in south Texas, to Josef and the former Antonia Cantú. He grew up with his Mexican-American mother. He enlisted in the Army when the United States entered what was then known as the Great War. He used his Anglo father's name to avoid being segregated into a non-combat unit.
As a part of Company A, 356th Infantry, 89th Division in France, he and Sergeant M. Waldo Hatler swam across the Meuse River near Pouilly-sur-Meuse to get behind German lines and gather information about troop strength and deployments. They were able to gather the needed information; however, returning across the river, Barkley was "seized with cramps and drowned". (This is the exact wording from his citation, duplicated below.) Sergeant Hatler survived to bring the information back to their unit.
Barkley was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions, one of three Texans to be awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I. Additionally, France awarded him the "Croix de Guerre", and Italy the "Croce al Merito di Guerra".
Private Barkley lies in state at the Alamo, the second person to ever receive this honor. He was then buried at the San Antonio National Cemetery.
Medal of Honor citation.
Rank and organization: Private, U.S. Army, Company A, 356th §→→→→§ 89th Division. Place and date: Near Pouilly, France, November 9, 1918. Entered service at: San Antonio, Tex. Birth: Laredo, Tex. G.O. No.: 20, W.D., 1919.
Citation
In memory.
Barkley has received three notable posthumous recognitions. In 1921, an elementary school in San Antonio, Texas, was named in his honor. On January 10, 1941, the U.S. Army installation, Camp Barkeley, was named in his honor. A clerical error resulted in the discrepancy in spelling. Finally, in 1989 when his Hispanic background was discovered, Barkley was recognized as the U.S. Army's first Hispanic Medal of Honor recipient.
David B. Barkley Plaza.
A memorial honoring the forty-one Hispanic soldiers who have received the Congressional Medal of Honor was built in Laredo in 2002 and named for Barkley. The David B. Barkley Plaza has a bronze statue of David B. Barkley and an American flag measuring 100 ft by 50 ft and is 308 ft tall making it the tallest flagpole in the United States. The memorial is located at .
The restored chapel at Laredo Community College is also named in Barkley's honor. Veterans Day services are held there each year.

Weakling

Weakling was a black metal band from San Francisco. The band never toured and released only one album, "Dead As Dreams", recorded in 1998 and released on Tumult Records in 2000.
History.
The name Weakling, according to founding member John Gossard, came from the title of a song by the band Swans from their album Filth. 
Weakling was initially started by guitarist John Gossard and guitarist/drum programmer Robert Williams of Ubzub. The two ended up releasing an early version of "No One Can be Called As A Man While He'll Die" on a compilation tape Wintergrief released by Nahitfol Productions in 1996. Briefly, Gossard and Williams continued with Weakling adding Jim Mack on bass, and Antoine Reuben Diavola on drums. Dissatisfied with the dedication of the members, Gossard left the band while the rest of the lineup continued on as Black Goat. The one idea contributed by Mack for the song "This Entire Fucking Battlefield" was later discovered to have been 'borrowed' from the Norwegian band Demonic's song "Nar Morket Faller".
Prior to the release of the album, a few odd tales sprung up about the possible ways it could be distributed, including printing a single copy to be given to a single fan in Europe or burying copies of the album in the ground and giving maps to fans who wanted to find them. Band leader John Gossard has since decried the spread of these stories as a publicity stunt pulled by the band's record label noting that the ideas were never intended to be more than a joke between the band members.
Initially, Weakling was mainly noted for featuring guitarist Josh Smith of The Fucking Champs (fellow Champ Tim Green served as producer), but a recent reissue of their material has brought their work some more attention, and the album has been hailed in some circles, and by musicians including Fenriz of Darkthrone, as a masterpiece. Weakling's sound displays inspiration from the works of Scandinavian bands like Bathory, Burzum and Darkthrone, as one might imagine it filtered through the lens of '70s progressive rock: all five songs on the 76-minute album run at least 10 minutes in length and each is composed of at least 2 distinct sections.
Gossard and bassist Sarah Weiner later played together in the similarly short-lived doom metal band The Gault (although Weiner was the drummer of that outfit); after that band's demise, Gossard went on to join established funeral doom outfit Asunder, and formed a second black metal band, Dispirit, in the wake of Asunder's dissolution. Keyboardist Casey Ward currently plays drums in The Husbands. First keyboard player Mindy Ingalls now lives in Michigan. Drummer Sam Foster currently plays drums for death metal band Saros.
Although Weakling has never officially announced a split, they broke up in 1999.

Romex system

The Romex system is a contract bridge bidding system designed by the Mexican bridge expert George Rosenkranz. Key features of Romex are the multiple meanings attributed to certain bids, namely the "Dynamic one notrump" and the "Mexican two diamonds".
Dynamic one notrump.
The dynamic one notrump opening indicates either: 
The most common responses to the dynamic one notrump opening are:
Higher level responses indicate control count.
A consequence of the use of the dynamic notrump is that the 1NT rebid by opener becomes wide-range (typically 12-16 hcp). With game invitational values or better, responder reacts to such a rebid with a 2 convention to ask opener to further describe his hand.
Mexican two diamonds.
This opening indicates one of four hands:
Other calls.
One-level and 2 openings are as per Standard American with 3+ minors and 5+ majors and limited by the failure to open one notrump.
Romex employs special asking bids in lieu of cuebidding, and for slam investigation.

German submarine U-2323

German submarine "U-2323") was probably the shortest lived German U-boat during the whole of the Second World War. Constructed at Hamburg during the spring of 1944, she was a modern German Type XXIII submarine, completed on the 18 July and given to Kptlt. Walter Angermann to command. A fast high-technology coastal boat, "U-2323" was expected to be the new war-winning weapon in the Kriegsmarine's arsenal.
The seas around the German coastline were subject to very heavy allied attack during the final two years of the war, as the Royal Air Force sought to restrict German movement around their coasts by sowing thousands of air-dropped naval mines, thus delaying the production and training of new boats, disrupting coastal shipping and destroying several boats before they could become involved in the Battle of the Atlantic.
The "U-2323" was a victim of this campaign, when on the 26 July 1944, just eight days old, she was sunk off Möltenort at the entrance to Kiel harbour on her maiden voyage. Two of her crew were killed in the blast, although the survivors managed to safely reach the shore. They were then transferred to other units. The holed boat was raised in early 1945, but was still undergoing repairs in Kiel at the time of the German surrender. It was broken up "in situ" post-war.

Virginia Randolph

Virginia Estelle Randolph (August 6, 1870 – March 16, 1958) was an African-American educator in Henrico County, Virginia. She was named the United States' first "Jeanes Supervising Industrial Teacher" by her Superintendent of Schools, Jackson T. Davis, and she led a program funded by the Jeanes Foundation to upgrade vocational training throughout the U.S. South as her career progressed. Her work is widely associated with vocational education. Two schools of the Henrico County Public Schools system were named in her honor.
Youth, education.
She was born on June 8, 1874, in Richmond, Virginia. Born only nine years after the end of the American Civil War (1861–1865) and Emancipation for the slaves in her community, Virginia Randolph was the third child of former slaves Sarah Elizabeth Carter Randolph and Edward Nelson Randolph. At the age of 16, she graduated from Richmond Normal School (now Armstrong High School) in Richmond, Virginia. also was honored in black history month.
Career in public education.
Miss Randolph began her career as a school teacher. After a short teaching experience in Goochland County, she secured a teaching position with the Henrico County School Board. She opened the Mountain Road School in the north central part of the county in 1892. As a teacher there, Randolph taught her students woodworking, sewing, cooking, and gardening, as well as academics. 
In 1908, Henrico County Superintendent of Schools Jackson T. Davis named her to become the United States' first "Jeanes Supervising Industrial Teacher." Anna T. Jeanes, a wealthy Philadelphia Quaker, had set aside $1 million to establish a fund to maintain and assist rural schools for African Americans in the South. Among its projects, the Jeanes Foundation provided funds to employ black "supervisors" dedicated to upgrading vocational training programs for black students. African-American supervisors of teachers in the rural south from 1908 to 1968, Jeanes teachers (formally called Jeanes supervising industrial teachers) worked toward improving the communities of schools.
As the overseer of twenty three elementary schools in Henrico County, Virginia Randolph developed the first in-service training program for black teachers and worked on improving the curriculum of the schools. With the freedom to design her own agenda, she shaped industrial work and community self-help programs to meet specific needs of schools. She chronicled her progress by becoming the author of the "Henrico Plan" which became a reference book for southern schools receiving assistance from the Jeanes Foundation, which became known as the Negro Rural School Fund. 
Randolph's teaching techniques and philosophy were later adopted in Great Britain's African colonies. 
On March 30, 1908, following a proclamation by Virginia Governor Claude A. Swanson, Miss Randolph founded the first Arbor Day Program in Virginia. She and her students planted twelve Sycamore trees. Some of the trees remain standing as living monuments, but over the years, some of the trees were lost to disease. In 1976, the remaining ones were named the first notable trees in Virginia by the National Park Service.
In 1915, Miss Randolph opened the Virginia Randolph Training School and later expanded the facility to include dormitories for future teachers. It was later renamed to Virginia Randolph Education Center.
Miss Randolph was appointed to the Industrial School Board of Colored Children after the death of another noted Richmonder, Maggie L. Walker. She also served for many years on the Inter-Racial and Health Board for the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
After a 57-year career with Henrico County Public Schools, Miss Randolph retired in 1949. A foundation to honor her and award scholarships was formed in 1954. She died in Richmond on March 16, 1958, at the age of 84.

Texas State Highway 111

State Highway 111 or SH 111 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas that runs from Gonzales to Midfield in Southeast Texas.
Route description.
SH 111 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 183 at the unincorporated community of Hochheim. The official TXDOT route designation has the route dextended northwest with US 183 to Gonzales, but it is not currently measured or mapped as part of the route and is not signed as such. The route travels east to Yoakum, intersecting US 90 Alternate, before travelling into downtown Yoakum. The route then turns southeast the oil field regions toward an intersection with US 59 at Edna. The route then turns due east, crossing over Lake Texana, before reaching its terminus at SH 71 at Midfield.
History.
SH 111 was originally numbered in 1926 on a route beginning at Hallettsville, and travelling southeast to Edna and continuing to Lolita, before turning east to Blessing, just south of Midfield, following the rail line of the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway. By 1933, the route was conditionally designated over most of that routing, with an extension from Hallettsville west to Gonzales. It also turn southward before reaching Blessing, instead going toward the community of Olivia on Matagorda Bay. In 1936, the route was pared down as construction stalled, with the numbering only covering the new routing from Edna east to Midfield. In 1939 the routing was redesignated over its current routing from Midfield through Edna and Yoakum to Hochheim. The section west of Yoakum was transferred from SH 95. The route was not completed between Yoakum and Edna until the late 1940s.

Vinča

Vinča (, ) is a suburban settlement of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is part of the municipality of Grocka. Vinča-Belo Brdo, an important archaeological site that gives its name to the Neolithic culture, is located in the village.
Location.
Vinča is located on the confluence of the Bolečica river into the Danube, on the Danube's right bank, 13 km east of Belgrade and 15 km west of its own municipal seat of Grocka. It is situated along the stream of "Makački potok", which empties into the Bolečica.
Population.
Vinča is statistically classified as a rural settlement (village). Originally it was situated 3 km from the road of "Smederevski put", but as the settlement expanded it now stetches from the Danube to the "Smederevski put", making urbanistic connections to the surrounding settlements of Ritopek, Boleč, Leštane and Kaluđerica, though making one continuous built-up area with Belgrade itself. Like the surrounding settlements, Vinča is an immigrant settlement with steady population growth:
Small bridge across the Bolečica on the "Smederevski put" marks a place where boundaries of four settlements meet (Vinča, Ritopek, Leštane and Boleč). Together they would make a settlement of population over 25,000.
Economy.
Vinča's economy is mostly based on agriculture, but it also experiences the most diversity of all the municipal settlements.
The experimental farm of Radmilovac, a section of the Agricultural Faculty of the Belgrade University is located to the east. In 2006 began the reconstruction and expansion of the farm, with new pools and projected covered areas that will turn Radmilovac into and experimental ground for future agricultural production.
The area along the "Smederevski put" turns into a commercial zone as gas pumps, restaurants, work shops and supermarkets are built. Vinča is on the route of the projected highway in the Bolečica river valley (separating from the Belgrade-Niš highway at Bubanj Potok) and a new bridge over the Danube (Vinča-Omoljica bridge) but a construction date is not yet given.
The Vinca Nuclear Institute was officially established on January 21, 1948 by the Serbian top physicist Pavle Savić as the Institute for Physics, though construction of the site began in 1947. On 15 October 1958, the institute was the site of a fatal criticality excursion in its heavy water-moderated research reactor. One researcher was killed and four others injured. The institute operated two research reactors. The larger 6.5 MW reactor achieved criticality in 1959 and was shut down in 1984. Another very low power reactor achieved criticality in 1958 and as of 2002 was operational. The institute was named the Institute for Physical Sciences 'Boris Kidrič' in 1953 and has its present name since January 1, 1992.
In the 1970s a modern urban settlement with small residential buildings was constructed for the employees of the Institute. In 2003, in an effort to secure the radioactive materials from the Institute, the U.S. government aided Serbia in the removal of the material. In 2010, large convoys moved the remaining 2.5 tonnes of nuclear fuel to a reprocessing facility in Mayak in Russia.
Belgrade's city landfill ("deponija") is located in Vinča. It was opened in the 1977, covers an area of 600,000 square metres and treats over 2,700 tons of waste daily. The landfill raised many ecological questions for years as only in the 2000s some of the major problems concerning waste managing began to solve. However, despite some recent improvements, the landfill is still far from the European standards of ecology.
Tourism is mostly centered around the archeological site of "Belo brdo" (Serbian for "white hill") and the museum of the Vinča culture, with boat trips down the Danube from downtown Belgrade to the small Vinča dock, right below the find, with several fish restaurants on the bank. Hotel 'Radmilovac' on the "Smederevski put" is the major such facility from Belgrade to Smederevo.
Politics.
A recent motion, as a result of big economic and demographic discrapancy between the western and eastern parts of the municipality, mentions Vinča of the possible seat of the future municipality formed from the western part of the municipality of Grocka, comprising Kaluđerica, Boleč, Leštane, and Ritopek.

Till We Have Faces (Steve Hackett album)

Till We Have Faces is the eighth solo album by guitarist Steve Hackett. The album is rock, with elements of world music. The majority of the album was recorded in Brazil, while the final mixing was done in London. The name of the album comes from a novel by C.S.Lewis, whose work is a long-time influence on Hackett.
As with most of Steve Hackett's records, the sleeve painting was created by his wife at the time, Kim Poor, the Brazilian artist, under the title Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats, after an instrumental piece by the group Genesis, on the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.
The album yielded a single which was split into two-halves, "A Doll That's Made in Japan", the 12" B-side, "Just the Bones" was never reissued in any form.

The 6th Man

The 6th Man is a 1997 American sports comedy film directed by Randall Miller, starring Marlon Wayans and Kadeem Hardison. The film was released in the United States on March 28, 1997. The film features real National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) schools, although the rosters are fictitious. Some schools shown in the film include the University of Washington, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Fresno State University, Georgetown University, the University of Kentucky, the University of Arkansas, UCLA, and others. The film features cameos from college basketball personalities such as Jerry Tarkanian and Dick Vitale.
Plot.
Antoine (Kadeem Hardison) and Kenny Tyler (Marlon Wayans) are shown as children playing in a basketball game. Their father is coaching the team and directs Kenny to take the last shot for the win since they are in deficit, but Kenny passes the ball to Antoine out of fright, who misses.
The film fast forwards to the present-day and both Antoine and Kenny are attending the University of Washington and make up a famed duo on their college basketball team, the Huskies. The team goes out to a night club to celebrate their most recent win. While at the nightclub Kenny meets R.C. St. John (Michael Michele), a reporter for UW, with whom he sparks an interest in.
Later Washington is playing a road game at UCLA. During the game Antoine suffers a heart attack. He is carried off the court and later flat-lines in the ambulance car before reaching the hospital. Coach Pederson (David Paymer), the head coach, informs Kenny and the team after the game that Antoine has passed away. Kenny and the team have a hard time processing the news.
The team begins falling apart after Antoine's death. During one game, however, odd sequences begin to occur, leading to a surprising win (later learned to be contrived by Antoine's spirit). Antoine later appears to Kenny in the locker room, which initially frightens Kenny, though he eventually realizes it is indeed Antoine. Antoine informs Kenny that he is the only one who can see him.
Kenny's teammates begin to question Kenny's concerning behavior (as they can not see Antoine).Kenny concedes into telling his teammates about Antoine's reemergence, who are in disbelief. The team is reluctant to believe Kenny, but are convinced once Antoine uses supernatural forces to persuade them. Antoine begins to help the team.
Under the influence of Antoine, the team begins to storm through the competition and eventually make it to the NCAA tournament, for the first time in years. Meanwhile Kenny's relationship with R.C. deepens, despite Antoine's efforts to disband the two as he believes R.C. is only out to get a story on him, which is partially true, as she is originally prepared to submit a story to the paper on him upon his revelation to her that Antoine is in fact aiding the team, though she eventually decides against it.
The rest of the team begins to have misgivings about Antoine aiding them in their games. They confront Kenny on the matter, who informs Antoine. Antoine becomes irate, which leads Kenny to allow Antoine to stay. However in a game before the national championship Antoine seriously injures a player, leading Kenny to side with his teammates and tells Antoine to leave.
The team plays poorly in the first half of the championship game. At halftime, Kenny gives a speech to fire the team up, telling them that they still have Antoine in their hearts. The team goes back in the second half with an impressive rally to bring the game close. Kenny attempts the game winning shot. Antoine tries to help but Kenny tells him not to, as he makes the shot on his own. Antoine tells Kenny that he is proud of him and that he is being called back to heaven, as he goes off into the distance under an array of lights. Coach Pederson sees this and asks Kenny if this was Antoine, to which Kenny admits.
Production.
It was set and filmed in Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on April 2 until May 17, 1996. It had an estimated budget of $11 million.
Release.
The film was released on March 28, 1997 and made $4,128,178 in its opening weekend at the box office, and went on to gross $14,772,788 throughout its theatrical run.
Reception.
"The 6th Man" has a 23% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and an average critic rating of 3.8/10 based on 13 reviews. Roger Ebert said of the film ""The Sixth Man" is another paint-by-the-numbers sports movie, this one about a college basketball team that makes it to the NCAA finals with the help of the ghost of one of its dead stars. Let's not talk about how predictable it is. Let's talk about how dumb it is. … Movies like "The Sixth Man" are an example of Level One thinking, in which the filmmakers get the easy, obvious idea and are content with it."
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was released on March 25, 1997 by Hollywood Records. It peaked at #33 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.

Dennis Coffey

Dennis Coffey (born November 11, 1940, Detroit, Michigan) is an American guitarist. He was a studio musician for many soul and R&B recordings.
Biography.
Coffey learned to play guitar at the age of thirteen, in the Michigan Upper Peninsula town of Copper City. In 1955, as a fifteen year-old sophomore at Detroit's Mackenzie High School, Dennis played his first record session - backing Vic Gallon in "I'm Gone", on the Gondola record label. In the early 1960s he joined The Royaltones who had had hits with "Poor Boy" in 1958 and "Flamingo Express" in 1961. The Royaltones played sessions with other artists including Del Shannon.
By the late 1960s as a member of the Funk Brothers studio band, Coffey played on dozens of recordings for Motown Records, and introduced a hard rock guitar sound to Motown record producer Norman Whitfield's recordings, including distortion, Echoplex tape-loop delay, and wah-wah; most notably heard on "Cloud Nine", "Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)" and "Psychedelic Shack" by The Temptations. He played on numerous other hit records of the era including #1 singles like Edwin Starr's "War" and Diana Ross & The Supremes "Someday We'll Be Together" and Freda Payne's #3 hit "Band of Gold". In addition, Coffey scored the blaxploitation film, "Black Belt Jones".
In 1971, Coffey recorded "Scorpio" which was a million selling instrumental single that peaked at #6 on the Billboard pop chart. The instrumental track featured the former Motown "funk brother", Bob Babbitt on the bass. On January 8, 1972 Coffey became the first white artist to perform on the television show "Soul Train", playing "Scorpio". "Scorpio" received a gold disc awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 9 December 1971.
The follow-up in 1972 was "Taurus", both credited to Coffey and the Detroit Guitar Band. Since then, he has recorded several solo albums, most of them for the Sussex and Westbound labels. While at Sussex Records Coffey arranged and produced along with Mike Theodore the million selling "Nice To Be With You" by the group, Gallery.
Coffey was interviewed in the 2002 film, "Standing in the Shadows of Motown", which told the story of Funk Brothers and explained that he had sold his Fender Stratocaster to buy a Gibson Firebird after he heard Eddie Willis of Funk Brothers play it during a Motown session.
In 2004, he published a memoir, "Guitars, Bars and Motown Superstars".
In 2008, he co-produced the Carl Dixon sessions at Studio A, Dearborn Heights, Michigan. Four tracks were recorded featuring some of the Funk Brothers including Uriel Jones, Bob Babbitt, Coffey and Ray Monette, plus other distinguished Detroit session musicians. Spyder Turner, Pree and Gayle Butts were vocalists on the session. The session was arranged by David J. Van De Pitte.
On April 26, 2011 (April 25 outside the US) Coffey released the self-titled album, consisting of new songs and new versions of songs which originally featured Coffey's distinctive guitar work. Promotion for the album is set to include an international tour, kicking off with several appearances at SXSW. Singer-songwriter Kendra Morris accompanied him on tour, performing backing vocals.
In 2012, Coffey was interviewed on the PBS program "History Detectives", about the authenticity of an old Ampeg B-15 amplifier with the stenciled name of fellow Funk Brothers member bassist James Jamerson.
Along with Mike Theodore, Coffey discovered the folk-rock singer-songwriter Sixto Rodriguez who is the subject of the 2012 Oscar winning film "Searching for Sugar Man" in which Coffey appears. Coffey played lead guitar on Rodriguez's first album Cold Fact.

<doc id="5970032" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5970032" title="Bernard Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny">
Bernard Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny

Bernard Stewart, 3rd Lord of Aubigny (French: Bérault Stuart) (c. 1452 – 15 June 1508) was a French soldier, commander of the "Garde Écossaise", and diplomat belonging to the Scottish family of Stewart of Darnley.
Early life.
Bernard was the grandson of Sir John Stewart of Darnley, who was given the lands of Aubigny-sur-Nere and Concressault by Charles VII of France for his service during the Hundred Years' War. Like his father and grandfather he was high in favour with the French King and was chosen as commander of the royal bodyguard. Because of his family background he was chosen as the envoy to James III of Scotland to announce the accession of King Charles VIII of France. He was also given the task of signing a treaty with the Scots renewing the Auld Alliance which he proceeded to sign on 22 March 1483.
Battle of Bosworth.
The Lord of Aubigny was also the medium of communication with the section of Scottish lords who favoured Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond in his rebellion against his distant cousin King Richard III of England. Henry was still an exile living in France along with the chief supporters of the House of Lancaster, the experienced John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford and Henry's uncle Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford. They relied heavily on the French king to finance the army and to be able to provide foot soldiers capable of fighting. In 1485 Bernard Stewart was chosen to command the French troops that accompanied the invasion and helped the Earl of Richmond become King Henry VII of England at the Battle of Bosworth Field establishing the Tudor Dynasty.
Italian wars.
In 1494 Charles VIII of France laid claim to the Kingdom of Naples and sent the Lord of Aubigny to Rome to press his claims to Pope Alexander VI. When Alexander refused to recognize Charles claim to Naples the king raised an army of 25,000 men (including 8,000 Swiss mercenaries) and began his descent into Italy. Stewart received orders from Charles VIII to lead one thousand of the king's cavalry over the Alps and into Lombardy and after taking part with Charles in the conquest of Romagna accompanied him in the triumphal entry into Florence on 15 November 1494. After this victory Stewart was made governor of Calabria and lieutenant-general of the French army.
The French quickly overran the disunited Italian peninsula and arrived in Naples on 21 February 1495, King Ferdinand II of Naples having fled to Sicily at the arrival of the French army. There, in temporary exile, Ferdinand joined his cousin Ferdinand II of Aragon King of Spain and Sicily who offered him assistance to regain his kingdom. In response to Charles' invasion the League of Venice was created which threatened to cut the invading army off in the south while the league occupied the north cutting the line of communications and supply. On 30 May 1495 Charles split his army taking half of his troops northward to fight their way back into France and leaving the rest to hold the recently conquered Neapolitan territories. After hard fighting at the Battle of Fornovo Charles and most of the French army made it safely back to France leaving Stewart and the rest of the army to fight off the expected Spanish invasion.
The Spanish general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba was dispatched from Spain with an army to reinforce the king of Naples. On 24 May 1495 he arrived in the port of Messina in Sicily, only to find that Ferdinand had already crossed over into Calabria with an army and had reoccupied Reggio. De Córdoba himself crossed over to Calabria two days later. He had under his command 600 lances of Spanish cavalry, many of these light "jinetes", and 1,500 infantry, many of them Rodeleros swordsmen, to which were added 3,500 soldiers from the Spanish fleet. The size of the Neapolitan army is unclear, but soon was supplemented by 6,000 volunteers from Calabria, who joined the Neapolitan ranks when Ferdinand of Naples landed. De Córdoba’s Spanish contingent was further depleted because he needed to put Spanish garrisons in several fortified places which Ferdinand turned over to Spain in partial compensation for the military aid Spain was providing. Although he was seriously ill with malaria which he had recently contracted, Aubigny lost no time in responding to the allied challenge, quickly consolidating his forces to confront the Neapolitan/Spanish invasion by calling in isolated garrisons throughout Calabria and requesting that Précy reinforce him with the Swiss mercenaries. In the following Battle of Seminara the Spanish and Neapolitan armies were routed by the French cavalry and Swiss pikemen led by the Scotsman Aubigny.
Stewart also took part in the 1499 campaign of King Louis XII of France and upon its successful conclusion was made Governor of Milan with command of the French army that was left behind by the king to garrison the towns of northern Italy. In 1501 he completed the conquest of Naples and was appointed Governor. But after a few successes in Calabria he was completely defeated at the second Battle of Seminara (1503) and became a prisoner at the Castel Nuovo in Naples until he was released by a truce signed on 11 November 1503.
Later life.
In 1508 he was sent as ambassador to consult King James IV of Scotland about the marriage of Princess Claude of France with the future King Francis I of France. It was as a result of this mission that Aubigny became the subject of two ballads by William Dunbar, "The Ballad of Lord Bernard Stewart" and "Elegy on the Death of Lord Bernard Stewart". James IV made him a member of the Order of St Michael. He died in Scotland at Corstorphine about 12 June 1508.
He was the author of a book on military science, "Traité sur l'art de la guerre", reprinted in 1976.
Marriage and titles.
He married firstly Guillemette de Boucard, secondly Anne de Maumont (died after 1510), Countess of Beaumont-le-Roger, becoming Count (jure uxoris) of Beaumont-le-Roger. He was granted the titles of Count of Arena, Marquis of Squillace, Marquis of Girace and Duke of Terranuova in the Kingdom of Naples.
Aubigny left one child, a daughter named Anne. Anne married her first cousin, Robert Stewart, a future Marshal of France.

History.
When early settlers first came to Colorado they were often drawn by the lure of riches to be found in the towering mountains to the west. The California gold rush of 1849 brought tens of thousands of men, many of them previously farmers, to the west. Many prospected on their way through Colorado. Often their dreams of riches ended in dust, and the disappointed miners returned to the plains to resume their former way of life – farming.
A number of small farming communities grew up on the rolling highlands west of pioneer Denver and Auraria. The area offered rich soil that, with irrigation, yielded abundant crops of wheat and vegetables. As its name reveals, the town of Wheat Ridge was built on a highland area that was soon covered with wheat farms. To its north the Clear Creek valley was soon filled with orchards and became known as Fruitdale. Further north, beyond the valley, other farmers built Arvada.
Henry Lee was born in Iowa, Oct. 31, 1841, to English immigrants. He became one of the best known Denver and Colorado pioneers. Henry came to Denver in 1864 from Iowa, following his elder brother, William, who arrived in the Denver area in 1845. William Lee had acquired extensive farming property between Wheat Ridge and Golden, just south of Clear Creek. The road to William‘s farm later became known as Lee Street. For the first few years Henry Lee earned his living by peddling vegetables from William’s farm to miners in the mining camps of Gilpin, Clear Creek and Park counties. William Lee served as a member of the First Colorado Constitutional Convention in 1859, representing Jefferson County. He also founded the first grange in Colorado and was a prominent member of the Colorado Pioneer Society. William Lee died on January 21, 1911, at the age of 74.
Jennie Paul Lee was born in Iowa City, Iowa, on March 8, 1850. She married Henry Lee in 1873, and moved to Colorado in 1875, where they settled on Henry’s farm. The Lee’s had three children, two sons, Murray and Robert Paul, and a daughter, Jessie.
Always a public-spirited citizen, Henry Lee took a great deal of interest in politics. He represented Jefferson County in the House of Representatives Third Assembly and served two terms in the State Senate for the Fifth and Sixth Assemblies.
While a member of the Third General Assembly and chairman of its committee on public lands, Henry Lee introduced a bill providing for the sale to the City of Denver, at a nominal price and without competition, of two sections of school land for park purposes. One of these sections comprises what is now Denver’s City Park. Lee was generally acknowledged as the father of the Denver park system, and served as Park Commissioner under both Mayors Johnson and Speer.
Over time Henry Lee acquired considerable land in Jefferson County, and at one time owned a whole section of what is now known as Edgewater and a large portion of Wheat Ridge. Crown Hill Cemetery is part of his old farm. Lee sold of land to the Crown Hill Cemetery Association in 1908 for $47,000. In 1914 Henry Lee still owned of the finest land in Jefferson County.
Henry Lee’s involvement in irrigation and water-related problems led to the construction of Denver’s first pumping station and the founding of the Agriculture Ditch Company. Henry served as secretary from the time the company was organized until his death. To support their extensive farming business, Henry and William Lee built the Lee and Brothers Lateral Irrigation Ditch, which ran along Middle Golden Road, now known as 32nd Avenue. William Lee also ran the Lee Sand and Gravel Company along Youngfield from 38th Avenue to North Golden Road (now known as 44 Avenue).
Henry Lee was a partner in the Pioneer Seed Company of Denver, and also owned Henry Lee’s Seed and Farm Implements, selling seeds and farm equipment, and designing and selling farm and market wagons, road carts, spring wagons, surreys, and carriages. He had originally brought farm implements and seeds from Iowa to start his prosperous business.
In 1908 Crown Hill Associates also purchased land from the Union Pacific Railroad, which was adjacent to the property purchased from William and Henry Lee. With this last purchase of land, the Crown Hill Associates’ total holdings included . Located on the property was the “Old Morgan House.” Henry Lee had purchased the Morgan (also recorded as “Margan”) Jones homestead in 1900. The portion containing the house, barns and other outbuildings, which are no longer standing, were contained in the land sold to Crown Hill in 1908.
On March 11, 1914, Henry Lee was the victim of one of Denver’s first auto-pedestrian accidents. Henry Lee died on March 24 from his injuries, and was buried at Crown Hill Cemetery.
Jennie Lee continued to help run their farm until their son, Murray, died in 1939. Jennie Paul Lee died in November 1943 at the age of 93.
The two water bodies on the park property today were natural ponds. Waters stored in Crown Hill Lake originate in Clear Creek and are transported via the Crown Hill Agricultural Ditch to Crown Hill Lake. Most of the water in Kestrel Pond is seepage from Crown Hill Lake.
The farming communities of Wheat Ridge and Lakewood gradually grew. Local residents were becoming increasingly concerned about the loss of their country lands. When the citizens of Jefferson County created the Open Space Program in 1972, Crown Hill’s neighbors began to urge the two cities to find a way to preserve one of the last large parcels of undeveloped land in what was then the most populous area of Jefferson County. In 1978 the Cities of Lakewood and Wheat Ridge joined the County in purchasing next to Crown Hill Cemetery and including Crown Hill Lake, creating Crown Hill Open Space Park.

Utah State Route 9

State Route 9 (SR-9) is a state highway in southern Utah, serving Zion National Park. It starts at the western terminus at exit 16 on I-15, passing through Zion National Park, and ending at the eastern junction with US-89. The entire length of the highway has been designated the Zion Park Scenic Byway. There is a fee to travel through Zion National Park, but the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway is open to private vehicles year-round. A separate fee is required for vehicles 7'10" wide and/or 11'4" tall or larger. This fee pays for a park employee to stop traffic from the other side of the Zion - Mt. Carmel Tunnel to allow the larger vehicles to pass through. 
There is a smaller tunnel in Zion National Park that does not require an escort. Commercial vehicles are prohibited from using SR-9 and are directed to use SR-20 instead.
Route description.
St. George to Zion National Park.
SR-9 begins at I-15, Exit 16, at Harrisburg Junction, just north of St. George. Immediately upon exiting I-15, SR-9 enters the Coral Canyon Development, which features an 18-hole golf course. Coral Canyon is split by the city boundaries of Hurricane and Washington Cities. Upon leaving this development, SR-9 passes through two ridges and begins its descent into the aptly named Purgatory Flats, home of the County Fairgrounds and a penitentiary. The 'flats' are a relatively level area between two sharply defined ridges. Quail Lake, which is in fact a reservoir, lies about a mile to the north of the road between these two ridges. Upon passing through the second ridge, SR-9 crosses the Virgin River & climbs a small plateau to the region of Hurricane known as Brentwood. The road descends from this plateau into downtown Hurricane, where SR-59 splits to the south and the Arizona Border. SR-9 then swings north towards the town of La Verkin, crossing an old bridge over the La Verkin River Ravine, before entering that town. In La Verkin, SR-17 takes off to the north, where it meets back up with I-15. After leaving La Verkin, SR-9 heads uphill and passes several mesas before eventually going through the small towns of Virgin, Rockville and Springdale.
Zion National Park to Mount Carmel Junction, Utah.
This scenic section of SR-9 twists and turns along through Zion National Park and then another 12 miles to Mount Carmel Junction. This section of the road is called the Zion-Mount Carmel Highway and the section through the park is effectively a toll road requiring park access fees. The highway begins on the south side of Zion National Park following along the North Fork of the Virgin River. The road then turns at the junction of Pine Creek and the North Fork of the Virgin River and continues up Pine Creek Canyon, up the switchbacks and into the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel. On the east side of the tunnel the highway continues through impressive scenery, past the Canyon Overlook Trailhead, the East Rim Trailhead and the unique Zion landmark, Checkerboard Mesa. Finally the road exits the park through the east entrance and later ends at the junction of SR-9 and US-89 in Mount Carmel Junction.
History.
The road from Hurricane north through La Verkin to US-91 at Anderson Junction was added to the state highway system in 1912, and a branch was added from La Verkin Junction east to Zion National Park in 1916 and beyond to Mt. Carmel Junction in 1923. In the 1920s, the State Road Commission assigned State Route 15 to the road from Anderson Junction to the park, while State Route 16 included the branch to Hurricane (and continued southeast to Arizona via present SR-59). In 1927, the state legislature extended SR-15 through the park to Mt. Carmel Junction, and added a new State Route 17, which formed a cutoff from US-91 at Harrisburg Junction east to Hurricane. SR-17 also included SR-16 from Hurricane north to La Verkin Junction and southeast to Big Plain Junction, where the realigned SR-16 turned north to SR-15 at Rockville. The portion of SR-17 from Hurricane to Big Plain Junction was split off as SR-59 in 1931, leaving SR-15 and SR-17 as a loop off US-91 through Hurricane and La Verkin, with SR-15 continuing east through Zion National Park.
Construction began through and east of the national park in 1927, on the portion that had been added to the state highway system in 1923 and to SR-15 in 1927. The Nevada Construction Company completed the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel in 1930, after three years of construction and a cost of $1,896,000. SR-15 and SR-17 were swapped in 1969, giving SR-15 the route from Harrisburg Junction and SR-17 its present route. In the 1977 renumbering, SR-15 was renumbered SR-9 due to the existence of Interstate 15.

German submarine U-2324

German submarine "U-2324" was a highly advanced submarine built for Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" in World War II. "U-2324" was one of the last commissioned boats to undertake an operational patrol, and one of just three of her class to undergo two. During these patrols, she succeeded in sinking a single small British coastal freighter, one of just five ships sunk by this submarine class.
"U-2321" was built as a German Type XXIII submarine at Hamburg during the spring of 1944. As an early production of a new class of boats which utilised new technologies, she required a lengthy period of sea trials and training to best develop the boat's offensive capabilities. It was thus not until January 1945 that her captain, Hans-Heinrich Haas, was permitted to take her on a patrol off the Eastern coast of Scotland.
War Patrol.
The first patrol was unsuccessful, Allied precautions and counter-measures were effective enough to prevent her from successfully targeting even the small coastal vessels to be found in this area. She returned empty-handed, and Haas was replaced by Konstantin von Rappard, who now commanded her for the remainder of her service career.
The second patrol of "U-2324" in April was more successful, with the SS "Monarch" being sunk. This 1,100 ton ship was torpedoed in a night attack on a coastal convoy, and was the only success of the boat during her operational career. "U-2324" returned to Stavanger in May 1945 the day before the surrender. When Germany surrendered, "U-2324" was at Stavanger in Norway, from where it sailed to Loch Ryan in Scotland for disposal in Operation "Deadlight". Towed out to sea on the 27 November, the boat was destroyed as a naval gunnery target.

Fountain Fresh International

Fountain Fresh International is a defunct United States company that operated soft drink and water dispensers at retail locations. Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Fountain Fresh developed and marketed in-store, self-serve soft drink and pure drinking water beverage centers in the mid-1990s.
The original value proposition was for consumers to enjoy low-priced beverages by washing and refilling reusable soft-drink bottles in the Fountain Fresh dispenser. In return for providing a bottle and operating the machine, consumers could purchase soft drinks for as low as 59-cents for one liter and two liters for 69-cents, a significant discount from the price of commercially bottled soft drinks. The concept was rolled out in several retail locations throughout the United States, including a large number of Wal-Mart stores. 
The stations proved messy, confusing, and difficult to operate, and few consumers saw the value of saving a few cents on beverages by using the units. The company enjoyed a brief flurry of interest in the mid-1990s, but by the late 1990s, was essentially out of business.
The company has since become an object lesson in understanding user needs before launching a major product line, and has been covered by such media outlets as NPR.

Ferenc Sas (16 August 1915 – 3 September 1988), born as Ferenc Sohn, in Argentina known as Francisco "Sas" Sohn, was a Hungarian football player. With the Hungary he played in the final of the World Cup 1938. With Hungária MTK FC and CA Boca Juniors he won national championships.
Life.
Ferenc Sas was born as the son of Leopold, who fell in World War I, and Roza Sohn. His parents were Jewish. He later hungarised his name, selecting "Sas", the Hungarian word for "Eagle", in order to get easier access to the Hungarian national team.
The right winger debuted in 1934 with Hungária FC, today's MTK Budapest. He impressed with his speed and technical abilities, one-on-ones were not his strength. He played in the front row alongside Pál Titkos and the Austrian Heinrich "Wudi" Müller in the team coached by Alfréd Schaffer that won the Hungarian Championships of 1936 and 1937.
In April 1936 Sas played for the first time for the national team, alongside Jenö Vincze on the right outfield, defeating Austria 5-3. A few days later in a match against Ireland he scores his first goal for the Magyars. Sas remained part of the Hungarian standard formation for the next two years.
In 1937 he was part of a Central-European selection that played in Amsterdam against a Western-European XI. In this match, which was organised by FIFA, he contributed with assists from György Sárosi and Italy's Silvio Piola two goals to the 3:1 victory of his side.
In 1938 he participated with Hungary at the World Cup in France. After 6-0 and 2-0 wins against Dutch East Indies (today's Indonesia) and , Hungary, coached by Alfréd Schaffer, defeated Sweden in the semi-final 5-1. Despite of the support of the majority of the crowd, in the final Hungary had little chance against Italy, led by Giuseppe Meazza and Silvio Piola, arguably two of the greatest players of the era, and lost 2-4.
After the World Cup he migrated to Argentina. In December 1938 he debuted in a friendly for CA Boca Juniors. In the ensuing season he played 24 matches for the Juniors, scoring 9 goals, sharing the club's top scorer honours with two other players. The following season he won the championship of Argentina. Sas, now called Francisco Sohn, however faced strong competition within the team and only played four league matches in that season. A friendly in March 1941 was his last match for Boca Juniors.
From the beginning of 1943 he played for three seasons in the second division with Argentinos Juniors. There he scored 12 goals in 72 matches. He continued to play at amateur level with "Macabi", where he also coached. He also coached at the "Colegio David Wolfsohn".
In Argentina he married his fiance who followed him from Hungary with whom he shared a son and three grandchildren. In later years he worked for the renown clothing store "Raitor", cinemas and a jeweller's store.

The Slovenian navy was built from scratch following independence in 1991, as the Territorial Defense Forces of Slovenia had not been equipped with any maritime assets. No significant action of the Ten-Day War occurred at sea. In 1991, a small diving detachment was formed in Ankaran, equipped with sport-diving equipment because of the UN arms embargo against the former Yugoslav republics. After the embargo was lifted in 1996, Slovenia bought a single Israeli-built IAI-Ramta Super Dvora Mk2-class patrol boat, named "Ankaran" after the coastal town. In 2008, the Ministry of Defense announced that Slovenia would procure one Russian Project 10412 patrol boat, offered in payment of a multi-million dollar debt owed to Slovenia. The vessel was subsequently named "Triglav", after the mountain and national symbol. Specially equipped for Slovenian needs, it is optimized for a patrol role and lacks the anti-ship missiles of the version in service with the Russian Navy.

<doc id="5970164" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5970164" title="A Prayer for My Daughter">
A Prayer for My Daughter

"A Prayer for my Daughter" is a poem by William Butler Yeats written in 1919 and published in 1921 as part of Yeats' collection "Michael Robartes and the Dancer". It is written to Anne, his daughter with Georgie Hyde Lees, whom Yeats married after his last marriage proposal to Maud Gonne was rejected in 1916. Yeats wrote the poem while staying in a tower at Thoor Ballylee during the Anglo-Irish War, two days after Anne's birth on February 26, 1919. The poem reflects Yeats's complicated views on Irish Nationalism, sexuality, and is considered an important work of Modernist poetry.
Background.
The poem begins by describing a "storm" which is "howling", and his newborn daughter, sleeping "half hid" in her cradle, and protected somewhat from the storm. The storm, which can in part be read as symbolizing the Irish War of Independence, overshadows the birth of Yeats' daughter and creates the political frame that sets the text into historical context. In stanza two, the setting for the poem is revealed as being "the tower", a setting for many of Yeats's poems, including the book of poems entitled "The Tower" (1928). This is Thoor Ballylee, an ancient Norman tower in Galway, which Yeats had bought in 1917 and where he intended making a home. 
Conflicts between Ireland and the United Kingdom were common subjects of Yeats' poetry, including his notable poems about the Dublin Lockout ("September 1913") and the Easter Rising ("Easter 1916"). David Holdeman suggests that this poem "carries over from 'The Second Coming'" in the tone it uses to describe the political situation facing Ireland at the end of World War One and with the formation of the Irish Republican Army.
Structure.
The poem contains ten stanzas of eight lines each: two rhymed couplets followed by a quatrain of enclosed rhyme. Many of the rhyme pairs use slant rhyme. The stanza may be seen as a variation on ottava rima, an eight-lined stanza used in other Yeats poems, such as "Among School Children" and "Sailing to Byzantium."
Metrical analysis of the poem, according to Robert Einarsson, proves difficult because he believes Yeats adheres to "rhythmical motifs" rather than traditional use of syllables in his meter. In stanza two, Einarsson points out instances where the meter of the poem contains examples of amphibrachic, pyrrhicretic, and spondaic feet. He argues that the complexity of Yeats's verse follows patterns of its "metremes", or rhymical motifs, rather than common metrical devices.
The poem also may be read to consist of straightforward iambic verse that relies on common metrical devices such as elision, acephalous lines, promotion, and metrical inversion. Lines 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 of each stanza are iambic pentameter; lines 4, 6, and 7 are iambic tetrameter. For instance, using traditional principles of scansion, stanza two may be scanned as shown below, where syllables in all caps represent metrical beats, lower-case syllables represent metrical off-beats, the vertical bar represents the termination of a metrical foot, and apostrophes represent elisions. The number of metrical feet per line is marked in parentheses at the end of each line:
I'ave WALKED | and PRAYED | for THIS | young CHILD | an HOUR (5)<br>
and HEARD | the SEA- | wind SCREAM | upON | the TOWER, (5)<br>
and UND- | er th'ARCH- | es OF | the BRIDGE, | and SCREAM (5)<br>
in th'ELMS | aBOVE | the FLOOD- | ed STREAM; (4)<br>
imAG- | 'ning IN | exCIT- | ed REV- | erIE (5)<br>

DANC- | ing TO | a FRENZ- | ied DRUM, (4)<br>
OUT of | the MURD- | 'rous INN- | ocence OF | the SEA. (5)
Critical reception.
As the poem reflects Yeats's expectations for his young daughter, feminist critiques of the poem have questioned the poet's general approach to women through the text's portrayal of women in society. In "Yeats's Ghosts", Brenda Maddox suggests that the poem is "designed deliberately to offend women" and labels it as "offensive". Maddox argues that Yeats, in the poem, condemns his daughter to adhere to 19th-century ideals of womanhood, as he focuses on her need for a husband and a "Big House" with a private income.
Joyce Carol Oates suggests that Yeats used the poem to deprive his daughter of sensuality as he envisions a "crushingly conventional" view of womanhood, wishing her to become a "flourishing hidden tree" instead of allowing her the freedoms given to male children. This was after Yeats was rejected in marriage by Maud Gonne. In Oates' opinion, Yeats wishes his daughter to become like a "vegetable:immobile, unthinking, and placid." 
Majorie Elizabeth Howes, in "Yeats's Nations," suggests that the crisis facing the Anglo-Irish community in "A Prayer for My Daughter" is that of female sexual choice. But, she also argues that to read the poem without the political context surrounding the Irish Revolution robs the text of a deeper meaning that goes beyond the relationship between Yeats and the female sex.

Fallout Protection

Fallout Protection: What To Know And Do About Nuclear Attack was an official United States federal government booklet released in December 1961 by the United States Department of Defense and the Office of Civil Defense.
The first page of the book is a note from then-U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara explaining that the booklet is the result of the first task he was given when he assumed responsibility for the Federal Civil Defense Program in August 1961. The task, assigned by President John F. Kennedy, was to "give the American people the facts they need to know about the dangers of a thermonuclear attack and what they can do to protect themselves."
Subject matter.
Much more straightforward about the dangers of atomic weapons than "Survival Under Atomic Attack", and published in the era of the hydrogen bomb and the ICBM, the book first explains general information and hazards of nuclear weapons, fallout and radiation. Second, it covers community fallout shelters, improvised fallout shelters and supplies that one ought to have ready in case of a nuclear attack. There is a brief section outlining "emergency housekeeping" which covers water and food conservation and first aid for the time spent in the shelter. Last, the booklet mentions recovery and how to clean up the fallout.

INS Hanit

The INS Hanit (, "Spear") is a Sa'ar 5-class corvette of the Israeli Navy, built by Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in 1994. On July 14, 2006, during the 2006 Lebanon War, it suffered damage after being struck by a Hezbollah C-802 anti-ship missile.
Attack on July 14, 2006.
During the 2006 Lebanon War, the vessel was patrolling in Lebanese waters ten nautical miles off the coast of Beirut. It was damaged on July 14, 2006 on the waterline, under the aft superstructure by a missile (likely a Chinese-designed C-802) fired by Hezbollah that reportedly set the flight deck on fire and crippled the propulsion systems inside the hull. However, INS Hanit stayed afloat, extricated itself and made the rest of the journey back to Ashdod port for repairs on its own power. Four crew members were killed during the attack: Staff Sergeant Tal Amgar, Corporal Shai Atas, Sergeant Yaniv Hershkovitz, and First Sergeant Dov Steinshuss.
According to the Israeli Navy, the ship's sophisticated automatic missile defense system was not deployed, even though the early warning system is usually deployed during peace-time wargames. In the aftermath of the event, reports suggested that no known intelligence existed which would have pointed to the fact that such a sophisticated missile was deployed in Lebanon by Hezbollah. In fact, the investigative work of Ha'aretz journalists Amos Harel and Avi Issacharoff showed that a certain Colonel K., an intelligence officer, had given a lecture already on April 21, 2003, predicting that Hezbollah had shore-to-sea missiles in its possession. Furthermore, on the morning of Friday, July 14, 2006, one of the branch heads of naval intelligence, Lieutenant-Colonel Y. briefed the head of naval intelligence, Colonel Ram Rothberg, telling him that "ships enforcing Israel's naval blockade on Hezbollah should take into account the possibility of a C-802 missile being fired on them." The assessment, however, did not result in a warning. If such a warning had been issued, Israeli ships would have moved farther away from the shore and activated their anti-missile systems.
As a result of the incident, two navy officers, two junior officers and the commander of the ship were formally reprimanded and repositioned to non-commanding positions on land. One of the junior officers had shut down the central radar and parts of the defence system without notifying the commander, in the belief that the ship was not under threat.
Repairs occurred over many months and the ship returned to active service in 2007.
IDF report.
An IDF report on the Lebanon war incident reveals that the crew did not act sufficiently in order to anticipate the threat.
The IDF report, which was submitted to Chief of Staff Dan Halutz, said, "as far as the intelligence picture is concerned, it was found that despite the lack of pinpoint information about the weapon in the hands of Hezbollah, there was information in the Navy in the past that could have led to some type of an assessment that the enemy holds shore-to-ship missiles." In addition, failures were uncovered in "the way the forces understood the operative reality and implemented it." As a result of this failure to predict possible missile threats, to save energy an officer had left the ship's anti-missile suite, designed to track incoming missiles, in standby-mode while patrolling near the coast.
The Israeli military has alleged that Iranian military advisors from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) had assisted with deploying and readying the missile launcher.

National Basketball Association music

The National Basketball Association has links to hip hop music and has also had its own famous anthem in "Roundball Rock". In recent years, the league has embraced country music and musicians and bands that could be considered tame by some observers (such as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Rob Thomas and Justin Timberlake).
Before the league introduced its current promotional phrase Big Things Will Happen, the league's former promotional phrases were ""'America's Game/NBA Action: It's Fantastic (1980s-1992), I Love This Game 
(1992-2007) and Where Amazing Happens""' (2007-2011).
Hip Hop.
For several years, the NBA has embraced "Hip-hop culture". Rappers Nelly and Jay-Z have ownership stakes in NBA teams (the Charlotte Hornets and Brooklyn Nets respectively), and many artists have worn NBA throwback jerseys in music videos. In turn, the NBA plays rap and hip-hop in arenas during games, and ABC/ESPN used the music during game coverage. Some NBA players have tried rap or hip-hop themselves (Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tony Parker, Allen Iverson (under the rap name "Jewelz"), and notoriously, Metta World Peace are some examples) and several also dress and act in ways that are in accordance with hip-hop culture (for example, the tattoos and jewellery worn by several players). In 1994, Epic Records released an album entitled "B-Ball's Best Kept Secret", which featured hip hop songs performed by several NBA players, including Jason Kidd, Dana Barros and Isaiah Rider.
Television.
CBS.
Unlike later NBA broadcast partners, CBS used lyrics in their theme music from 1973-76. They were also used for most of the 1978-79 season. The lyrics, sung in an upbeat fashion by an ensemble of singers, were paired with visuals using rotoscoped basketball players in silhouette, against a black background and outlined in different colors. The lyrics for the full version (there were also shorter versions of the theme and lyrics presented below) are below:
<poem>
"Give it all you've got,"
"Take your very best shot"
"And may the best team win."
"The time is now, the name of the game is action."
"They're on the floor,"
"And they're ready to score,"
"So let the game begin,"
"And let's see how the ball's going to bounce today"
"Welcome to N-B-A."
"Come on, and join the roar of the crowd""
"Here's another classic about,"
"To come your way..."
"You'll see the best in basketball"
"When you watch the N-B-A,"
"When you watch the N-B-A on C-B-S."
"(N-B-A on C-B-S, N-B-A on C-B-S, ... etc. fading out)"
</poem>
Starting in 1977, CBS used an alternate opening showing a montage of still pictures of current NBA star athletes with music (similar to the music used by the network for its CBS' NFL coverage at that time) accompanying it. During the 1977-78 season CBS used highlights and various shots of the arena where the game would take place to the music of Van McCoy's "Two Points". In 1980, CBS used rotoscoped animation in silhouette of one player shooting a jumpshot and the ball in mid air rolling all the NBA teams as it spun in the air, with disco-pop-moog music behind it. During the 1978-79 season, the music for the highlights was "Chase", the theme by Giorgio Moroder for the movie "Midnight Express". The opening guitar and horn riff of the Chicago hit "Alive Again" were used for the highlights prior to the opening animation during the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons.
By the 1983 NBA Finals, the opening sequence was set in a primitive computer-generated montage of basketball action inside a virtual arena that looked similar to the Boston Garden. This opening sequence (which was usually intertwined by a montage of live basketball action complete with narration) was created by Bill Feigenbaum, who also created a similar open for "The NFL Today" used around the same time. This opening melody (mostly consisting of an uptempo series of four notes and three bars each) from 1983-1988 is generally considered to be the most familiar theme music that "The NBA on CBS" used.
For the 1989 NBA Finals, CBS completely revamped the opening montage. The computer-generated imagery (once again set in and around a virtual arena) was made to look more realistic (live-action footage was incorporated in the backdrops). Also, the familiar theme music was rearranged to sound more intricate and to have a more emotional impact, along the lines of the network's later World Series coverage. Between the 1989 NBA Finals and the 1990 NBA Finals' intros, there is a slight theme tune revision. The 1989 Finals intro had a lot more of a guitar riff to it. Meanwhile, the 1990 Finals intro carried a little more usage of a trumpet sound.
CBS would also create special intros during the NBA Finals composed of music from either "Terms of Endearment" or "St. Elmo's Fire" playing in the background.
On June 14, 1990, CBS televised its final NBA broadcast to date. It was Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Detroit Pistons and Portland Trail Blazers. As a way of saying farewell and thank you to the viewers after 17 years, CBS used Marvin Gaye's rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" from the 1983 NBA All-Star Game as the soundtrack for their closing montage (featuring the greatest moments in the history of "The NBA on CBS").
NBC.
"Roundball Rock" was the theme music NBC used for its game telecasts from 1990 to 2002. The theme became synonymous with NBA basketball, primarily because it was used at the height of the Michael Jordan era (and the height of the NBA's popularity). Written by John Tesh, "Roundball Rock" went through several slight variations (including two different versions used in 2001 for going into commercial breaks, and a separate rendition for NBC's WNBA telecasts) but remained virtually the same for all twelve years of its existence.
The theme was sampled by Nelly in his song "Heart of a Champion" and was used in both an "NBA on NBC" video game and the movie "Like Mike". Both Conan O'Brien and Craig Kilborn paid comedic tributes to the theme when the "NBA on NBC" ended, and John Tesh was asked about the theme by O'Brien when he appeared on his show in late 2004. During that same episode of "Late Night with Conan O'Brien", the theme was played over footage of the recent Pacers–Pistons brawl.
NBC recently brought back the theme for its coverage of basketball during the 2008 Summer Olympics.
ABC.
Until the Pacers–Pistons brawl, ABC and ESPN used a heavy amount of hip-hop and heavy metal music during pregame montages. On the January 4, 2003 telecast of a Dallas Mavericks/Philadelphia 76ers game, ABC played the Ludacris song "Move Bitch" and censored expletives by using the sound of dogs barking. In the wake of the NBA taking steps to fix negative perceptions of its players, little to no rap music is played prior to games on either network.
ABC's current NBA game theme is called "Fast Break", by Non-Stop Music. It is the third game theme the network has had, dating back to 2002-03. The theme is now also used on ESPN NBA coverage.
ABC's earlier coverage of NBA basketball, ending with the 1972-1973 season, included a theme song with lyrics. Including also with the 2012 Playoffs with intro music .Among the lyrics were the lines, 
TNT/TBS.
TNT's NBA theme music, composed by Trevor Rabin, has been the same for the past six years (since the start of the 2002-03 NBA season), the longest of the league's three broadcast partners. The theme music was slightly modified for the 2010-11 NBA season, but still retained the familiar theme music with additional compositions. In 2006, TNT used the Fort Minor "Remember the Name" as secondary music for its playoff coverage and continues to do so in certain segments of their 2007 NBA Playoffs coverage. In the late 1990s, TNT used a swing band to sing its theme (with the refrain of ""It's the NBA on TNT tonight..."") for promotional advertisements. Sister station TBS used Run-DMC to sing and create its theme during the early part of the 2000s.
During the 2008 NBA Playoffs, TNT used Busta Rhymes and Linkin Park's collaboration "We Made It" as promotion for the Western Conference.
The song "More" by Usher was used to promote the 2010 NBA All-Star Game on TNT.
The song "Winner" by Jamie Foxx was used to promote the 2010 NBA Playoffs on TNT.
The 2011 NBA on TNT - NBA Forever commercial included the song "Live Forever" by Drew Holcomb.
"Burn It Down" by Linkin Park was used in the teaser of the 2012 NBA Playoffs on TNT.
League promotions.
The NBA has used several artists in league produced promotions. During the 2000s, the league has used Pink's song ""Get the Party Started"", Christina Aguilera's song ""Fighter"", the Baha Men's song ""Move It Like This"" and Paul Simon's song ""Father and Daughter"" among others.
Where Amazing Happens.
During the 2007-2008 season, the NBA ran a series of advertisements featuring still images set to the tune of Carly Comando's song Everyday with the promotional phrase Where Amazing Happens. Following the popularity of the original 30 second commercial, several others featuring Dirk Nowitzki, Chris Paul, and NBA Cares were produced. They have retained the Where Amazing Happens ads (along with Everyday) for the 2008-2009 season. The NBA Playoffs tagline, beginning in 2009, was Where Will Amazing Happen This Year?, usually accompanied with either Ludovico Einaudi's song Fly or Kanye West's song Amazing.
In the 2009-10 NBA season, new advertisements were aired, using Auto-tune to feature players and coaches "rapping" to a supplied hip-hop piece. Also during the season, several advertisements aiming towards Hispanic audiences were also produced, promoting its Spanish language website "NBA.com/enebea"
For the 2010-11 NBA season, the theme was Last Season was Last Season, featuring players looking to move forward from last year's disappointment in a renewed drive towards the NBA championship. In one of the newest commercials, gigantic Adobe Photoshop cutouts of the player's faces were used in substitute to their normal sized faces to provide a bobblehead effect. The bobblehead commercials has achieved popularity and the NBA plans to use another version in the future.
During the 2011 NBA Playoffs, commercials featuring the animated talking official NBA ball were aired.

Kotelny Island

Kotelny Island (, ) is part of the Anzhu Islands subgroup of the New Siberian Islands located between the Laptev Sea and the East Siberian Sea in the Russian Arctic. It is administratively and municipally part of Bulunsky District (; ).
Kotelny, Faddeyevsky and Bunge Land are usually named as separate islands on most 20th century maps, although sometimes on the newest maps the name "Kotelny" is applied to the whole island. A flat, low-lying, plain connecting both is known as Bunge Land (Земля Бунге).
The total area of Kotelny Island is 23,165 km². Kotelny is one of the 50 largest islands in the world. These merged islands are a practically uninhabited territory belonging to the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation.
History.
The island was officially discovered by a Russian merchant and hunter, Ivan Lyakhov, with the merchant Protod’yakonov, in 1773. In 1770, Ivan Lyakhov noticed reindeer tracks heading seaward across the sea ice. In 1773, he and Protod’yakonov discovered the Lyakhovsky Islands by boat using the bearing of these tracks. Continuing from the Lyakhovsky Islands, they discovered Kotelny Island and named it "Kettle Island" after a copper kettle, which they found while exploring it. The person(s), who visited Kotelny Island and left the copper kettle, is unknown. Formerly this island had been known as "Thaddeus Island" or "Thaddeus Islands" in some maps.
Under the employment of Semen and Lev Syrovatskiy, Yakov Sannikov conducted numerous hunting and cartographic expeditions between 1800 and 1810. On one of these expeditions in 1805, he discovered Faddeyevsky Island. In 1809-1810 Yakov Sannikov and Matvei Gedenschtrom went to the New Siberian Islands on a cartographic expedition. Yakov Sannikov reported the sighting of a "new land" north of Kotelny in 1811. This became the myth of Zemlya Sannikova or "Sannikov Land".
In 1886 Baron Eduard Von Toll thought that he had seen an unknown land north of Kotelny. He guessed that this was the so-called "Zemlya Sannikova".
Geography.
The western part of Kotelny Island proper, also known as "Kettle Island", is the largest section of the group, with an area of 11,665 km². It is rocky and hilly, rising to 374 m on Mt. Malakatyn-Tas. The Chukochya River flows westwards to the Laptev Sea. The Anisiy Cape is the northernmost headland of Kotelny and it is an important geographical point for it marks the NE limit of the Laptev Sea.
Bunge Land or Zemlya Bunge is a huge empty and almost barren intermediate zone. It is located between Kotelny and Faddeyevsky, which, unlike Bunge Land, could be described as proper islands. Sandy and flat, its area is 6,200 km². Since it rises only to a maximum height of 8 m above sea level, Bunge Land is flooded during storm surges, except for a very small area in the southeast that rises to an elevation of 11 to 21 m above sea level. The area that is periodically submerged accounts for over 80% of the total surface and is practically devoid of vegetation. Bunge Land is named after Russian zoologist and explorer Alexander Alexandrovich Bunge.
Faddeyevsky Peninsula (полуостров Фаддеевский) is a large peninsula projecting from the northern end of Bunge Land eastwards with its isthmus in the north. There is a deep inlet on Faddeyevski between its western coast and adjoining Bunge Land. Unlike Kotelny this island is relatively flat despite its size, its highest point being only 65 m. Its area is 5,300 km². Faddeyevsky is covered with tundra vegetation and dotted with small lakes. This island was named after a fur trader called Faddeyev who built the first habitation there.
Geology.
Kotelny Island consists of sedimentary rocks and sediments ranging in age from Early Paleozoic to Late Cenozoic. The oldest rocks fossiliferous shallow- to deep-water marine, Ordovician to Early Devonian limestones and dolomites. Middle Devonian to Carboniferous interbedded limestones, dolomites, sandstones, and conglomerates overlie these sedimentary strata. The Permian to Jurassic strata exposed within Kotelny Island consist of interbedded, fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandstones. All of these sedimentary rocks are faulted, folded into complex anticlines and synclines, and intruded by thin diabase dikes. Pleistocene to Holocene fluvial sediments, which range in age from 1,500 to greater than 55,000 radiocarbon years BP, underlie stream terraces that lie within the Balyktakh and Dragotsennaya River valleys. Thick permafrost has developed in these sediments.
Within Bunge Land and the southwest corner of Kotelny Island, relatively unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from Early Cretaceous to Holocene overlie the above folded and faulted sedimentary rocks. The oldest of these sediments are Early Cretaceous alluvial clays, silts, and sands that contain layers of conglomerate, tuff, tuffaceous sandstone, coal, and, at top, rhyolite. The Late Cretaceous sediments are overlain by Late Eocene to Pliocene alluvial sands that contain layers of clay, silt, gravel, brown coal, and lignitized wood. The vast majority of Bunge Land is blanketed by Early Holocene marine sediments. Only in the central and southern parts of Bunge Land do either Late to Early Pleistocene marine sediments or very small patches of highly weathered Prequaternary deposits and bedrock underlie the surface.
The surface of Faddeyevsky Island is underlain by unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from Early Cretaceous to Pleistocene. Three very small and isolated exposures indicate that the Early Cretaceous strata are similar to those found in the southwest corner of Kotelny Island. Overlying the Early Cretaceous sediments are alluvial and lacustrine Eocene clays and silts that contains rare beds of sands, brown coal, and gravel. To the north these sediments grade laterally into nearshore marine clays with fossil pelecypods. The Eocene sediments are overlain by fossiliferous, terrestrial and marine Oligocene to Miocene sands that contain subordinate beds of mud, clay, gravel, and brown coal. The Oligocene-Miocene sands accumulated in alluvial, lacustrine, and nearshore marine environments. Overlying the Oligocene-Miocene sands are Pliocene alluvial, lacustrine, and nearshore marine, muds, silts, and sands.
Pleistocene deposits blanket most of the surface of Faddeyevsky Island. A layer of Late Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial and lacustrine deposits largely cover the central and southern parts of Faddeyevsky Island. Middle and Late Pleistocene deposits largely cover the northern part of this island. The permafrost is about 400 to 500 m thick. The central plain of Faddeyevsky Island has been highly altered by thermokarst processes. It contains numerous deep erosive cuts created by the seasonal melting of the permafrost. Numerous baydzharakhs, thermokarst mounds, dot landscape, They are the result of the melting of polygonal ice wedges within the permafrost.
Vegetation.
Rush/grass, forb, cryptogam tundra covers all of Faddeyevsky Island and most of Kotelny Island. It is tundra consisting mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants either mostly or completely cover the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky.
Prostrate dwarfshrub, herb tundra covers all of Bunge Land and the eastern part of Kotelny Island adjacent to it. This type of tundra consists of dry tundra with open to patchy (20-80% cover) vegetation. The dominant plants comprising prostrate dwarfshrub, herb tundra are shrubs, i.e. Dryas spp. and Salix arctica, less than 5 cm tall, graminoids, and forbs. Lichens are also common.
Climate.
Kotelny Island has a harsh arctic climate, with temperatures only reaching above freezing briefly in the short summer months.
Strategic Importance.
Between 1933 and 1993, Kotelny Island hosted an important Soviet naval (Northern Fleet) base. An arctic research station was also co-located there. As of 2013, steps are underway to reactivate this base, with a temporary airstrip (referred to as "Temp") for flying in supplies and personnel having been established by a Russian naval task force that visited the New Siberian Islands during September 2013. Other initial infrastructure and supplies for the base, along with associated personnel were also landed by the task force, whose flagship was the Kirov class Battlecruiser "Petr Velikiy".
In popular culture.
Part of the action of Jules Verne's novel "César Cascabel" (1890), takes place on Kotelny Island. There the European protagonists encounter 350-400 members of a "Finnish tribe" who make their living by whaling and sealing.

Donkey Cabbages

"Donkey Cabbages" (or "The Donkey Cabbage") is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, tale number 122. Andrew Lang included it in "The Yellow Fairy Book".
Ruth Manning-Sanders included it, as "The Donkey Lettuce", in "A Book of Witches". In 1988, the story was also animated by Japan's Nippon Animation studio for its "Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics" series; the title of the episode in the English version produced by Saban Entertainment is "The Magic Heart".
Synopsis.
A huntsman gave an old woman alms. She told him to go to a tree where nine birds fought for a cloak. If he shot among them, one would die and they would drop the cloak that turned out to be a wishing cloak. Furthermore if he swallowed the heart of the dead bird, he would find a gold coin by his pillow every morning.
He went out into the world and came to a castle where an old witch lived with her beautiful daughter. The witch knew about the bird's heart and told her daughter what she must do to steal it. She gave the man a drink, and the bird's heart came up. The daughter swallowed it herself. Then the witch told her that she had to steal the wishing cloak as well, and how to do it. The daughter looked at the Garnet Mountain and told the huntsman that she wished she were there. He took her under the cloak and wished them both there. He slept there and she stole the cloak and wished herself back home. 
Three giants saw him and talked of killing him, but the third said that a cloud would bear him away. He climbed up the mountain and rode off on a cloud. It took him to a cabbage garden. He was so hungry that he ate some. It turned him into a donkey. He went on and found a different patch of cabbage which turned him back into a man. He took both kinds of cabbage and went back to the castle. He told the witch that he was a royal messenger sent to fetch the finest cabbage for the king, but he was afraid that the heat would make it wither. The witch asked for some. He gave it to her and she, her maidservant, and the daughter all ate the cabbages and became donkeys. The huntsman sold them to a miller, telling him to give the old one (the witch) one meal a day and three beatings, the younger one (the maidservant) three meals and one beating, and the youngest (the witch's daughter) three meals and no beatings. 
After a time, he came back to the miller to see how the donkeys were doing. The miller told him that the oldest donkey was dead, but the two younger donkeys were so sad he thought they would die. The huntsman bought them back and turned them back into women. The witch's daughter told him where the cloak was and said she would give him back the heart as it had been stolen, but he said it would make no difference, if they wed. So they married.

Non-dim circuit

A non-dim circuit is a special electrical network. In theater, it is a type of outlet usually controlled from the stage manager's panel or from the Lighting control console . The word non-dim is used to distinguish this type of circuit which operates only in on or off modes, from a dimmer, which can be at any intensity on a continuum. It is generally a remotely operated relay.
Many modern computerized lighting systems allow a dimmer to be set as "non-dim" and controlled using the Lighting control console, however, this can be less desirable than using a "true" switched circuit, as the Triac in the dimmer never truly supplies a "proper" sine wave, which can cause damage to equipment.
Non-Dims are often used to allow switched equipment such as motors, hazers or other similar electrical equipment to be triggered as part of a lighting cue. Sometimes house work lights or stage work lights can be controlled using a non-dimmed circuit. It is also sometimes used to provide power to intelligent lights, however this may not be considered desirable as any mistakes made at the Lighting control console could interrupt the power supply to the fixture which often are not capable of hot restrike (turning on the lamp again while power is still connected) due to their use of a Metal halide lamp or similar lamp.
The term "non-dim" has come to refer to any circuit, outlet, relay or otherwise that 1) cannot be controlled by a Lighting control console or 2) is a circuit controlled by the Lighting control console but has been set up not to dim.

Losing Grip

"Losing Grip" is a song by Franco-Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne released as the fourth single from her multi-platinum debut album, "Let Go" (except in Australia and New Zealand where "Mobile" was released). It was released in late spring of 2003 after the success of "I'm with You". The song was written by Lavigne and Clif Magness, and produced by Magness. The song is much heavier with grunge oriented sounds, than most of the songs on "Let Go" that had a more poppy feel. She performed "Losing Grip" at the Juno Awards of 2003. It is about Lavigne "losing grip" with her boyfriend as they are just not meant to be. The single was certified Gold by the RIAA on September 22, 2003.
Music video.
The music video shows Lavigne performing in front of a large crowd. Shots of her making her way through a mass of people while pushing, punching and shoving interlude from time to time.

The music video was directed by Liz Friedlander.
Reception.
Christina Saraceno of Allmusic noted that "Losing Grip" allowed Lavigne to "show off" her vocal ability during the song's "explosive rock chorus". Sal Cinquemani of "Slant" magazine also praised Lavigne's vocals and compared them to Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette.
In an AOL Radio listener's poll, "Losing Grip" was voted Lavigne's tenth best song.

<doc id="5970281" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5970281" title="Female sex tourism">
Female sex tourism

Female sex tourism refers to tourism by females, who travel intending to engage in sexual activities with a sex worker. Female sex tourists may seek aspects of the sexual relationship not shared by their male counterpart, such as perceived romance and intimacy.Women - especially wealthy, single, older women - plan their holidays to have romance and sex with a companion who knows how to make them feel special and give them attention. The prevalence of female sex tourism is significantly lower than male sex tourism. 
Female sex tourism occurs in diverse regions of the world. The demographics of female sex tourism vary by destination, but in general female sex tourists are usually classified as upper-middle to upper class women from a developed country, who travel to less developed countries in search of romance or sexual outlets.
Female sex tourists can be classified in three types:
Within the realm of female sex tourism, male sex workers are vital for the satisfaction of these women, whether physical or emotional. Without the employment of local sex workers, sex tourism for both men and women would not exist. Sex tourism is becoming a global phenomenon. With this movement of different populations to different countries, problems concerning health increase, especially ailments involving sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS. Women involved with sex tourism do not find themselves using barrier contraceptives during the majority of their visit, leaving them unprotected against STIs.
Destinations.
A number of countries have become popular destinations for female sex tourism, including Southern Europe; the Caribbean (led by Jamaica, Barbados and the Dominican Republic); Mexico, Southeast Asia, (Bali in Indonesia and Phuket in Thailand); and Gambia, Senegal and Kenya in Africa. Other destinations include , Tunisia, Morocco, Fiji, Ecuador and Costa Rica.
Motives for travel.
Traditional sex tourism.
Traditional female sex tourists have the same intentions as their male counterparts, and travel to foreign countries that have lower wages, and take advantage of cheap prostitution at a level unaffordable in their own countries. 
Examples of these sexual-economic relationships can be found in countries like Kenya, Africa, where women from the United Kingdom travel to Kenya to enjoy the sun and enjoy the “company of young men” in a sexual manner.
Situational sex tourism.
Situational sex tourists differ from traditional sex tourists by considering their sexual activities with the sex worker as an added amenity to their original motive to travel.
The background of the situational sex tourist consists of first time tourists who do not plan on being involved intimately with local men. The majority of these first time tourist will become involved in relationships where the tourist becomes romantically involved with the local men rather than being exclusively physical with the sex workers.
Situational sex tourism occurs when foreign tourists are lured in by male sex workers, known as either "beach boys" in the Caribbean, "gringueros" in Costa Rica or local men. According to the tourists, they are usually lured in due to the exotic appeal that these men emulate. The exotic appeal can come from the ethnic differences between the sex worker and the sex tourist or the foreign lifestyle that these men live 
The sex workers will target women who they deem vulnerable (Older or younger overweight women).
Romance tourism.
Romance tourism refers to a different relationship than female sex tourism. The term has been notably defined by researchers in this field, Deborah Pruitt and Suzanne LaFont.
The concept of romance tourism came from Pruitt and LaFont’s observations in Jamaica; it appeared to them that the female tourist and local males viewed their relationship with each other solely based on romance and courtship rather than lust and monetary value. Pruitt and LaFont add that romance tourism is an issue of gender identification: “gender identity is a relational construct, the Western women who seek to break from conventional roles require a different kind of relationship with men in order to realize a new gender identity”. With Western women becoming more independent and financially self-reliant they are able to travel, showing their independence from men of their culture, “female tourists have the opportunity to explore new gender behavior”. Like traditional sex tourists, romance tourists have a motive for travel, romance tourists travel to underdeveloped countries to find romantic relationships.
Terminology.
There is an ongoing debate on terminology regarding female sex tourism. Pruitt and LaFont argue that the term “female sex tourism” is not representative of the relationship that female tourists have with local men. They argue that “female sex tourism” oversimplifies the motives of these women and that “romance tourism” explains the complex nature of what these women are engaging themselves in while involved in romance tours. They also explain that the expression “female sex tourism”, “serves to perpetuate gender roles and reinforce power relations of male dominance and female subordination, romance tourism in Jamaica provides an arena for change”.
Scholars such as, Klaus de Alburquerque come back and argue that the term “romance tourism” overcomplicates what the motives of sex tourists are. de Albuquerque explains that concepts like "romance tourism" are only representative of small niches, like that of Jamaica and its cultural beliefs. Through his research, he concludes that the majority of female sex tourists are solely touring for physical encounters and not romance. He also says that the “tourist and beach boys may define their relationships as one of romance, in reality, the relationship is one of prostitution”.
Researcher, Jacqueline Sanchez-Taylor, argues that the term, “romance tourism”, and even the term “female sex tourism” undermines what is actually happening in these situations. She compares female and male sex tourism and shows how each relationship is based upon sexual-economic relationships. She also explores on whether or not female sex tourism is based on romance and if there is some sort of sexual-economic relationship occurring between the two parties. She continues to explain, “The fact that parallels between male and female sex tourism are widely overlooked, reflects and reproduces weaknesses in existing theoretical and commonsense understandings of gendered power… sex tourism”.
Sex workers.
Background and intentions.
Male sex workers have different names in different regions, Western society refer to them as sex workers and male prostitutes. In the Caribbean and Central America, most notably Costa Rica, they label the sex workers as "beach boys" and "gringueros", rent-a-dreads, rent-a-rastas, rent-a-gents and the Foreign Service (Caribbean),
Male sex workers are not confined to the profession of sex work, they usually have an additional source of income that they may supplement while working as a sex worker.
Male sex workers have more freedom and security than female sex workers do because males are not confined to a brothel or a pimp and are not generally physically abused by their clients.
Similar to the sex tourists, sex workers have their own intentions. Just as some Western women may consider the local men exotic, the local men may consider Western women to be exotic. Popular characteristics that appeal to a majority of sex workers are women with blonde hair and light colored eyes. Some of the sex workers will specifically target this type of exotic woman for their own personal pleasure with no guarantee of monetary gain.
On the other side of the spectrum, most sex workers have the intention of making some form of monetary gain. Such a sex worker typically profiles tourists, in hopes of increasing his monetary wealth the fastest. While profiling he will look for older women, over the age of forty or young, overweight women. The sex worker considers these women vulnerable and will play on their vulnerability to get the tourists to obtain feelings for the sex worker. Once the tourist and sex worker obtain a relationship the sex worker finds it easy for them to have an open relationship regarding monetary exchange.
Defined by the tourist.
Romance tourists do not label their sex workers “prostitutes”. The local men and the tourists understand their roles in the relationship. The primary difference in definition of a local man to a romance tourist and a local man to a sex tourist is the emphasis the romance tourist places on passion instead of a transaction of goods or money for sexual favors.
Health risks.
The rate of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, may be relatively high in some countries which are popular destinations for female sex tourism, particularly in comparison to the home countries of many sex tourists. Little or no research has been done into the transmission rates of HIV and other STDs pertaining to sex tourism. Neither has there been reliable research done into whether or not condom use is prevalent among female sex tourists. However, writer Julie Bindel speculates, in an article for the Guardian, that HIV infection figures for the region suggest that condom use by the "beach boys" in the Caribbean may be sporadic, yet female sex tourists do not appear especially preoccupied by the potential risks.
Women seeking to experience sex with foreign men put themselves at a higher risk for STIs. Condom use during sex tours is relatively low. It is often cited that women have the intention to have safe sex with their casual sex partners while on vacation, but at some point during the initiation of the condom, the women do not follow through.
The sex workers usually will not initiate the use of a condom due to either the limited availability of condoms, cost, beliefs or previous experiences the sex worker has had with condoms.
The lack of barrier contraceptives increases the risk of the tourist obtaining a sexually transmitted infection from their foreign partner especially when their partner has been with multiple women.
With sex tourism, women report that, given the atmosphere and the exoticness of their lover; condoms are rarely used or discussed prior to engaging in sexual activities.
It has been found that in the Monteverde region of Costa Rica data researched by Nancy Romero Daza, has shown that female tourists in the region engage in some form of unprotected sexual activity with local men known as Gringueros. The women in the study were found to not be traditional sex tourists but situational sex tourists.

Other professions.
Carollo worked as an international account executive for 30 years at IBM before becoming Vice President of Global Sales for Milwaukee, Wisconsin based Manpower Inc.
Officiating career.
Early years.
Carollo began his officiating career working Wisconsin high school football, basketball, and baseball games. He joined college football's Big Ten Conference, where he stayed for ten years and included a selection to work the 1988 Rose Bowl Game. In addition to officiating football games in the Big Ten, he was a basketball referee from 1982 to 1988. For a period of time, he also served as the Milwaukee Brewers Official Scorer for the American League.
National Football League.
Carollo started in the NFL as a side judge and officiated Super Bowl XXX in 1996 at that position, then became a referee (crew chief) for the start of the 1997 NFL season after Red Cashion and Howard Roe announced their retirements. Carollo was assigned to work his first post-season as referee during the 1998-99 NFL playoffs and later made his second appearance in the Super Bowl at Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003. Before he officiated Super Bowl XXXVII, Mike Pereira, the NFL's director of officiating, said of Carollo, "Bill is just perfect in the management of a game. He understands how to handle coaches, players and a team of seven officials. He's terrific at that."
While serving as referee of the 1999 NFC Championship game between Tampa Bay and St. Louis, Carollo overturned a catch by Tampa Bay's Bert Emanuel, that later led to the adoption of the Bert Emanuel Rule. by the NFL. The play consisted of Bert Emanuel making what was ruled a catch at St. Louis' 22-yard line with 47 seconds left in the game and the Buccaneers down by 5. After review, Carollo ruled that the tip of the ball had touched the ground, and even though Emanuel maintained control of the football, Carollo had to rule it an incomplete pass. This led to the NFL clarifying the definitions of both a catch and an incomplete pass, as to avoid this scenario replaying itself in the future. This is known as the Bert Emanuel Rule.
He served as the director of the NFL Referees Association, the union representing NFL officials, from 2000 to March 1, 2006. He was the center of the negotiations that took place during the 2001 NFL season where there was a work stoppage by game officials. The NFL and its game officials eventually agreed on September 19, 2001 to a new six-year Collective Bargaining Agreement that ended a two-week lockout of the regular officials, who returned to work on September 23, 2001.
His 2007 NFL officiating crew consisted of Bill Schuster, John Schleyer, Gary Arthur, Bill Lovett, James Coleman, and Phil Luckett.
On November 18, 2007, Carollo became the first referee in 35 years to officiate a game for the same team in back-to-back weeks during the New England-Buffalo game. Bill Leavy was scheduled to officiate the November 11th Buffalo-Miami game, but fell ill. Carollo served as the referee for that contest using Leavy's crew.
In August 2008, Carollo announced he would retire as an NFL referee at the end of the 2008 NFL season to become the Director of Officiating for the Big Ten Conference. His final assignment was for the AFC Championship game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens on January 18, 2009. Don Carey, brother of NFL referee Mike Carey, was promoted from back judge to take Carollo's place as a crew chief.
In Carollo's twenty-year NFL career he officiated in two Super Bowls, a third SB as alternate referee, eight NFL Conference Championships and one Pro Bowl. Currently Bill is Director of Officiating for the Big Ten, Mid-American and Missouri Valley football conferences. This new officiating alliance, Midwest Football Officials Alliance was created in 2009 and headquartered in Park Ridge, IL.

USS Armadillo (IX-111)

USS "Armadillo" (IX-111), the lead ship of her class of tanker was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the armadillo, an insect-eating mammal which has an armorlike shell encasing its back and head. Her keel was laid down as "Sidney Howard" (T. Z-ET1-S-C3), under a Maritime Commission contract (MCE hull 1900) on 24 September 1943 at Wilmington, California, by the California Shipbuilding Company. She was launched on 26 October 1943 sponsored by Mrs. S. Howard, renamed "Armadillo" and designated IX-111, acquired by the Navy on a bareboat basis, and simultaneously placed in commission at San Pedro, California, on 18 November 1943, Lieutenant Michael R. Meyer in command.
Following her commissioning, the vessel began a period of final fitting out and shakedown training off the southern California coast. In January 1944, "Armadillo" was assigned to Service Force, Pacific Fleet, and sailed for Pearl Harbor. From early February through early April 1944, the vessel carried personnel and petroleum products between Pearl Harbor and Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. On 22 April, she reported to Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, where she served as a station tanker through late August. "Armadillo" then shifted to Ulithi, Caroline Islands, to perform the same duty. This service was broken by trips to Guam and Saipan in the Mariana Islands and to Peleliu in the Palau Islands.
"Armadillo" left Ulithi on 10 April 1945 and shaped a course for Okinawa. She arrived there on 18 April and began providing services to various ships of the Pacific Fleet. On 1 February 1946, the tanker departed Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and headed for the East Coast of the United States. She transited the Panama Canal on 13 March and continued on to Norfolk, Virginia. The vessel reached that port on 23 March and began preparations for her inactivation. "Armadillo" was decommissioned on 29 May 1946 and, on the same day, was delivered to the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration at Lee Hall, Virginia. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 June 1946. The ship was sold later that same year and was converted for merchant service.
"Armadillo" earned one battle star for her World War II service

Shell (theater)

In theater, a shell (also known as an acoustical shell, choral shell or bandshell) is a curved, hard surface designed to reflect sound towards an audience.
Often shells are designed to be removable, either rolling away on wheels or flying into a flyspace. Shells are most commonly used for orchestras, bands and choirs, although they can also be used in any application that requires passive sound amplification. Shells are generally made of hard materials because they are designed to absorb as little sound as possible.
