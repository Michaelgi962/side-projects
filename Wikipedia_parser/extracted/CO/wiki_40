Concept programming

Concept programming is a programming paradigm focusing on how "concepts", that live in the programmer's mind, translate into "representations" that are found in the code space. This approach was introduced in 2001 by Christophe de Dinechin with the XL Programming Language.
Pseudo-metrics.
Concept programming uses "pseudo-metrics" to evaluate the quality of code. They are called pseudo-metrics because they relate the concept space and the code space, with a clear understanding that the concept space cannot be formalized strictly enough for a real metric to be defined. Concept programming pseudo-metrics include:
Rule of equivalence, equivalence breakdown.
The "rule of equivalence" is verified when the code behavior matches the original concept. This equivalence may break down in many cases. Integer overflow breaks the equivalence between the mathematical integer concept and the computerized approximation of the concept.
Many ways to break the equivalence have been given specific names, because they are very common:
Methodology.
To write code, concept programming recommends the following steps:
Many programming tools often lack in notational abilities, thus concept programming sometimes requires the use of preprocessors, domain-specific languages, or metaprogramming techniques.
Languages.
XL is the only programming language known to date to be explicitly created for concept programming, but concept programming can be done in nearly any language, with varying degrees of success. Lisp and Forth (and their derivatives) are examples of pre-existing languages which lend themselves well to concept programming.
Similar works.
There are projects that exploit similar ideas to create code with higher level of abstraction. Among them are:

Se (instrument)

The se () is an ancient Chinese plucked zither (string instrument). It has a range of 50-25 strings with moveable bridges and has a range of up to five octaves.
History.
The history of the "se" extends back to early Chinese history. It was one of the most important stringed instruments to be created in China, other than the guqin. The "se" was a highly popular instrument during the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn period. Surviving specimens have been excavated from places such as the Hubei and Hunan provinces, and the Jiangnan region of China. Other places include Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Liaoning. In Hubei, the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (in the late 400's BCE) was a treasure trove of ancient Chinese instruments, including a complete set of "bianzhong" (bronze bells), "se", "guqin" (plucked zither), stone chimes, and a drum. His musical entourage of 21 girls and women were also buried with him. By the Warring States Period, the early types of "guzheng" emerged, which was developed from the "se". Thus, it is sometimes said that the "guzheng" is essentially a smaller and simplified version of the "se" (with less strings).
According to legend, Fuxi created the "se". It is also believed that by the time of the Xia Dynasty the "se" had already come into being. It is said that the word for music, "yue" (樂), is composed of the characters "si" for silk (絲) and "mu" for wood (木), and that it is a representation of the instrument.
There are also many mentions in Chinese literature, such as "Shijing" and "Lunyu". 
The "se" has always been a high-brow musical instrument. As early as in the Zhou Dynasty, it was used to play ritualistic music for sacrificial offerings. 
A similar instrument called "seul", derived from the "se", is still used in the Confucian ritual music of South Korea, which is performed twice per year at the Munmyo Shrine in Seoul. In Vietnam, the instrument was called "sắt" and used in a limited context along with the "cầm" (equivalent to the Chinese "guqin").
Construction.
The "se"'s strings were made of twisted silk, in varying thicknesses. According to "Lüshi Chunqiu" on the number of strings that the "se" has: "A five stringed se, then became a fifteen stringed se. When Shun came to power, he added eight strings, so it became twenty-three." Another view suggests that the "se" started out with 50 strings. The "Shiban" later changes it to 25. "A big se has 50 strings, a middle se has 25." It also says that Fuxi created the 50 stringed "se", called "Sha" whilst the Yellow Emperor reduced it to 25. There also is a "small se" that has half of the strings, 13 strings (like the Japanese koto). But archeological evidence has also unearthed "se" with 25, 24, 23, or 19 strings. The string number differs from place to place. The length is also different. 
Unearthed "se" have similar construction, namely a flat long sound-board made of wood. The surface board of the "se" is slightly curved, and has three end bridges and one bridge at the head, plus four wooden posts for the strings to wrap around (some have two or three only). The posts also have patternation or decoration. The tail-end of the instrument has a long " 冂 " shaped opening for the strings to pass through. To string the instrument, one needs to tie a butterfly knot at the head of the string, strung through a bamboo rod, over the bridge at the head and over the main body of the instrument and over into the tail-end bridge into the instrument, out of the sound hole at the bottom of the instrument, over the tail-end and wrapped around the posts in four or three groups. 
Although both are ancient zithers, one should note that the "guqin" and the "se" are different instruments in their own right.
Playing context.
There are very few players of the "se", which largely became extinct during ancient time, although it is survived in the "guzheng". The only notable "se" player in the 20th century was Wu Jinglüe, who was primarily a "guqin" player. There are also very few surviving examples of musical tablature for the instrument, a majority existing in "qinpu" (tablature for the "guqin") in which the "se" was used to provide accompaniment for the "qin".
Recently, there has been a revived interest in the "se", with some musicians studying it. There are also a few factories that make a modern "se" using nylon-wrapped metal strings, though the instrument needs to be properly researched using modern mediums for it to be fully acceptable as a playable instrument for general musical purposes.

Holger Roed

Holger Peter Roed, known as Holger Roed (2 November 1846 - 20 February 1874), Danish painter, was born in Copenhagen to painter Jørgen Roed and wife Emilie Mathilde. He had a promising artistic career ahead of him when he died at the age of 27. 
He was one of two children, along with Helena, in the lively and cultured artistic Roed household.
He started his training at the Royal Danish Academy of Art ("Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi") in 1861, won the small silver medallion in 1864, and graduated in 1866. He received the small gold medallion in 1868 for ""Den fortabte Søn"" ("The Prodigal Son") and the large gold medallion in 1870 for ""Optrin af Syndfloden"" ("A Scene from the Great Deluge"), both of which are in the collection of the Academy. 
He received a travel grant from the Academy which allowed him to travel 1870-1872 to Italy (Rome and Naples). Towards the end of his tour in Italy he became sick and returned home. He tried to bolster his health with a stay in the countryside, but died on 20 February 1874 at Iselingen estate near Vordingborg from an abdominal inflammation.
In addition to schoolwork he managed to exhibit ""Udsigt fra Knippelsbro"" ("A View from Knippelsbro Bridge") and ""Portræt af en ung Musiker"" ("Portrait of a Young Musician") during his short life. An unfinished painting, ""Et Jagtparti"" ("A Hunting Scene"), was completed by his father.

Herbert Alexander Bruce

Herbert Alexander Bruce FRCS (September 28, 1868 – June 23, 1963), served as the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Canada, from 1932 to 1937.
Born in Blackstock, Ontario near Port Perry, Bruce was educated as a surgeon at the University of Toronto and in Paris and Vienna. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. He owned Wellesley Hospital in Toronto which he founded in 1911, and was a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto. 
In 1916, during World War I, he was appointed inspector-general of the Canadian Army Medical Corps by Sir Sam Hughes, and attained the rank of colonel. 
Bruce investigated medical practices in the army and issued a "Report on the Canadian Army Medical Service" which urged a complete reorganization of the medical corps. His report was disowned by the government at the time and he was dismissed from his duties, though many of his recommendations were ultimately implemented. In 1919, he published "Politics and the Canadian Army Medical Corps", criticizing the government for its actions. 
In 1920, Bruce purchased a farm on Bayview Avenue overlooking the Don Valley and built a Tudor-style mansion which he named Annandale. 
In 1932, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by R.B. Bennett for a term that lasted until 1937. He often verbally clashed with new Ontario Premier Mitch Hepburn who attempted to curtail the extravagance of the vice-regal office in the face of the Great Depression. The lieutenant-governor's official residence, Chorley Park, was closed by the Hepburn government at the end of Bruce's term on the pretext of cutting costs. 
While most lieutenant-governors are former politicians, Bruce took the unusual step of entering politics following his term as the King's representative. Following the sudden death of Conservative MP David Spence in the middle of the 1940 federal election campaign, Bruce contested and won Spence's seat in the Canadian House of Commons in the 1940 federal election. Sitting as the Conservative Member of Parliament for Parkdale, Bruce was an outspoken advocate of conscription. He was re-elected to a second term in the 1945 federal election, but retired from office in 1946. 
His autobiography, " Varied Operations", was published in 1958. He died in Toronto on June 23, 1963. He is buried in section Q-143 in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

<doc id="2875095" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2875095" title="Kingdom of Burgundy">
Kingdom of Burgundy

Burgundy is a historic region in Western Europe, now Southern France, named after its founders, the Burgundians. The Burgundians originated from mainland Scandinavia, and then settled on the island of Bornholm, whose name in Old Norse was "Burgundarholmr" (the Island of the Burgundians), and from there moved again to mainland Europe.
Burgundy itself has existed as a political entity in a number of forms with different boundaries. Two of these entities - the first around the 6th century, the second around the 11th century - have been called the Kingdom of Burgundy; a third was very nearly createdas was more than one noble state of Burgundyincluding a County and duchy, almost all of them being influential and fairly wealthy. 
In the last stages of the later house of Burgundy, Burgundy had become one of the most influential and powerful states in Europe and a great prize as a duchy, with possessions obtained by marriage and inheritance extending from and encompassing the Netherlands (then including modern Belgium), and extensive lands from Lorraine and encompassing the entire surrounds of the valley of the river Rhône, nearly to the Rhine abutting western Switzerland extending down the Rhône Valley to the Mediterranean coast. 
The area correlates with today's border regions between France, Italy and Switzerland; in other words a country-sized region roughly centered on Lyons or Geneva. The later-period Duchy of Burgundy, eventually failed of a male heir and became assimilated into Habsburg lands by the marriage of Duchess Marie to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. With the marriage of their son Philip to Juana, heiress of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, it was eventually inherited by their son Charles I of Spain (Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor), and became part of the Spanish Empire of his son, Philip II of Spain.
First Kingdom of Burgundy (4th century - 534 AD).
The first documented, though not historically verified King of the Burgundians was Gjúki (Gebicca), who lived in the late 4th century. In the course of the Crossing of the Rhine in 406, the Burgundians, an East Germanic tribe, settled as "foederati" in the Roman province of Germania Secunda along the Middle Rhine. Their situation worsened when about 430 the Burgundian King Gunther started several campaigns into neighbouring Gallia Belgica, which led to a crushing defeat by joined Roman and Hunnic troops under Flavius Aetius in 436 near Wormsthe origin of the mediæval "Nibelungenlied" poem.
The remaining Burgundians from 443 onwards settled in the "Sapaudia" (i.e. Savoy) region, again as "foederati" in the Roman Maxima Sequanorum province. Their efforts to enlarge their kingdom down the Rhône river brought them into conflict with the Visigothic Kingdom in the south. After the fall of the Roman Empire in 476, King Gundobad allied with the mighty Frankish king Clovis I against the threat of Theoderic the Great. He was thereby able to secure the Burgundian acquisitions, leaving the "Lex Burgundionum", an Early Germanic law code.
The decline of the kingdom began when they came under attack from their former Frankish allies. In 523 the sons of King Clovis campaigned the Burgundian lands, instigated by their mother Clotilde, whose father King Chilperic II had been killed by Gundobad. In 532 the Burgundians were decisively defeated by the Franks at Autun, whereafter King Godomar was killed and finally Burgundy was annexed by the Frankish Empire in 534. 
Between 561 and 584 as well as between 639 and 737 several rulers of the Frankish Merovingian dynasty bore the title of a "King of Burgundy". In the course of the 843 partition by the Treaty of Verdun, Burgundy became part of Middle Francia ("Lotharii Regnum") ruled by Emperor Lothair I, except for its northwestern part, the Duchy of Burgundy ("Bourgogne"), which fell to West Francia.
Second Kingdom of Burgundy (933 - 1378).
Overview.
The second Kingdom of Burgundy, also called the Kingdom of Arles (alternatively spelled as Kingdom of Arelat), existed from 933-1033 as an independent entity and from then (when it was absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire) to 1378 when it was succeeded by the Duchy of Burgundy. It had incrementally come into existence by the merger of several short lived states which themselves came into existence in power vacuums along the Rhône within the region of the First Kingdom of Burgundy.
These smaller states gradually coalesced into two states known as Upper Burgundy and Lower Burgundy (which began as the Kingdom of Provence and Burgundy), which had been sundered by the division of Middle Francia upon Lothair I's death, were united as the Second Kingdom of Burgundy.
Location in brief.
The Kingdom of Arles came to occupy most of Provence and Burgundy, the southern lands of the former kingdom of Middle Francia (or Lotharingia which only lasted 14 years but excluding Emperor Louis I's inheritance in the Kingdom of Italy). Middle Francia (or Lotharingia) was the central slice of the great Franks' Empire of Charlemagne, created by the three way division of the Frankish Empire after the death of Louis the Pious gave rise to the civil war (840-843) between his three sons by the 843 Treaty of Verdun.
Prelude-Carolingian maneuverings 840-931.
In failing health, shortly before his death in 855 at Prüm Abbey, Emperor Lothair I bequeathed the southern part of his realm of Middle Francia, consisting of the larger southeastern part of the former Kingdom of Burgundy and the Provence, to his youngest son Charles of Provence (sometimes called "Charles of Burgundy" or "Charles of Burgundy and Provence"). 
Lothair's brothers Charles the Bald and Louis the German intervened and prevented the inheritance and succession of their late brother's dignities as a Monarchy, preventing any of their Frankish nephews from elevating themselves and eliminating the Kingdom of Lotharingia. The two instead partitioned the middle realm's lands between East and West Francia, although allowing their nephews to retain their respective duchies, accepting that part of the king's arrangements.
According to the 870 Treaty of Meerssen, the northern part of First Burgundy was allotted to Charles's uncle King Louis the German of East Francia, while the southern lands with Provence fell to King Charles the Bald of West Francia until 875.
Results of the partition.
Upon Charles's death in 877, followed by that of his incapable son Louis the Stammerer two years later, the Frankish noble Boso of Provence proclaimed himself a "King of Burgundy and Provence" at Vienne in 879. 
Reunification.
This second Kingdom of Burgundy was absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire under Conrad II in 1033, as the Kingdom of Arles. It was one of the three kingdoms within the medieval Empire, the others being the Kingdom of Germany and the Kingdom of Italy. The Kingdom of Burgundy or Arles gradually lost its territorial integrity as sons inherited pieces over time, and other pieces were dispersed through diplomacy. Large parts were already held by the Counts of Savoy when Arelat ceased to exist in 1378, after the remnants were ceded to the French Dauphin Charles VI by Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg "(Dauphiné).
The Burgundian lands, and the failed proposal to create a third Kingdom of Burgundy.
The House of Burgundy was a dynasty that ruled the Duchy of Burgundy from 1032 to 1361, and the Free County of Burgundy from 1330, when the wife of Eudes IV inherited it from her mother, until 1361. It did not rule the Kingdom of Burgundy.
From 1384 to 1477 both the Duchy of Burgundy and the Free County of Burgundy were ruled by a cadet branch of the House of Valois (see Dukes of Burgundy). By the mid-15th century this dynasty also ruled most of the provinces in the Low Countries, making it one of the most powerful ruling houses in Western Europe. 
The territories of the House of Valois-Burgundy in the Low Countries were never part of ancient Burgundy proper, but the combined territories of the ruling house are sometimes referred to as the Burgundian Lands or the Burgundian Netherlands. However all of these lands were notionally held by the House of Valois-Burgundy as feudal vassals of either the King of France or the Holy Roman Emperor. 
Duke Charles the Bold conceived the project of combining his territories into a third kingdom of Burgundy with himself as its fully independent monarch, and even persuaded the Emperor Frederick to assent to crown him king at Trier. The ceremony, however, did not take place owing to the Emperor's precipitate flight by night (September 1473), occasioned by his displeasure at the Duke's attitude, and ultimately ended the duchy as an independent realm with the defeat and mutilation of Charles, also called 'the brash', at the Battle of Nancy.

<doc id="2875112" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2875112" title="Ticknall">
Ticknall

Ticknall is a small village and civil parish in South Derbyshire, England. Situated on the A514 road, close to Melbourne, it has three pubs, several small businesses, and a primary school. Two hundred years ago it was considerably larger and noisier with lime quarries, tramways and potteries. Coal was also dug close to the village. Close to the village is Calke Abbey, now a National Trust property.
The old village of "Tichenhalle" is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and probably existed from Anglo-Saxon times. Ticknall was an estate village to Calke Abbey until late in the 20th century. It reached its heyday in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when the limeyards and the brickmaking, tile and pottery industries were operating at maximum capacity. The population reached 1500, treble the present number of around 500. Since the neighbouring Calke Abbey changed its status in 1984 from long-standing private occupation by the Harpur-Crewe family to semi-public administration by the National Trust, much of the village has changed. The break-up of the former estate has meant the sale of cottages and building land, altering not only the randomness of the architecture, but also the dilution of the former feudal relationship between the villagers and their somewhat reclusive lords of the manor. The village has developed with examples of new buildings and renovations.
Near the entrance to Calke Abbey is Tramway Bridge, which is now a Grade II listed structure. There is also a tramway tunnel, almost 140 yards in length, under the drive to Calke Abbey. The National Trust restored it in the 1990s and it can be traversed on foot. It was built in 1802 by the Derbyshire engineer Benjamin Outram to carry the former Ticknall Tramway and subsequently connect the brickyards and limeyards around the village to the Ashby canal at Willesley Basin. It was too costly to build the expensive locks that would have been required to bring the canal to Ticknall, so the tramway was constructed as a cheaper alternative. Although abandoned in 1915, the tramway can still be traced intermittently along its route, which passed through the estate of Calke Abbey where two tunnels were needed.
At the start of the 19th century the Ticknall Limeyards were operated by two different classes of people, namely freeholders and tenants. Some of the freeholders in the parish had their own limeyards while others were worked by tenants for the Harpur-Crewe and Burdett families. As the century progressed the freeholders went bankrupt for various reasons while the tenants of the Harpur-Crewe family gave up because of the high rents charged and general mismanagement of the limeyards.
The village boasts three pubs, The Wheel, The Staff of Life and the Chequers Inn. The latter dates from the 17th century. On the lanes throughout the village can be found several water pumps. These sturdy and attractive cast iron devices were introduced into the village around 1914 by Sir Harper Crewe to, what was then, the estate village to provide fresh water. Several of these unusual pumps still work and are still used by walkers.

Kingdom of Hejaz

The Kingdom of Hejaz was a state in the Hejaz region ruled by the Hashemite family. It became independent from the collapsing Ottoman Empire as a result of World War I when the Sharif of Mecca made a deal with the British that the Arab population would be instigated to revolt against the Turks in exchange for a unified Arab country. In 1916, the Sharif of Mecca declared himself King of Hejaz as his Sharifian Army participated with other Arab forces and the British Empire in expelling the Turks from the Arabian peninsula.
The Hejaz region had strategic infrastructure, particularly the Hejaz railway, which was put out of operation in the war as it was used to reinforce Turkish forces in the region.
The kingdom was annexed in 1925 by the neighbouring Sultanate of Nejd under a resurgent House of Saud, and merged into the Kingdom of Nejd and Hejaz, which would eventually be known as Saudi Arabia in 1932.

Ngan’gityemerri language

Ngan’gityemerri—or Ngan’gi for short—is an indigenous language spoken in the Daly River region of Australia’s Northern Territory. The language is spoken in three mutually intelligible dialects: Ngan’gikurunggurr, Ngen’giwumirri, and Ngan’gimerri, which are 90% cognate but distinct languages sociolinguistically. Ngan’gi is spoken by about 150-200 people in the region around the Daly River (most living in the communities of Nauiyu, Peppimenarti and Wudigapildhiyerr) and in a number of smaller outstations on traditional lands (such as Nganambala and Merrepen).
Spelling variants.
Ngan’gi is sometimes also referred to by its speakers as Ngan'gityemerri. The varieties of this language have using widely differing spellings, including Nangikurrunggurr, Ngankikurungkurr, Ngenkikurrunggur, Ngangikarangurr, Ngankikurrunkurr, Nangikurunggurr, Nanggikorongo, Nangikurungguru, Nangikurungurr, Nangikurunurr, Nangityemer, Ngan’gikurunggurr, Ngangikurongor, Ngangikurrunggurr, Ngangikurrungur, Ngan'gikurunggurr, Ngangikurunggurr, Tyemeri, Moil, Moiil, Moyl, Moyle, Ngangi-Wumeri, Ngenkiwumerri, Nangumiri, Nangiomeri, Nangimera, Mariwumiri, Mariwunini, Murin-wumiri, Nanggiomeri, Nanggiwumiri, Nanggumiri, Nangimeri, Nangiomera, Nangi-wumiri, Ngan'giwumirri, Ngengewumiri, Ngen'giwumirri, Ngengomeri, Ngen-gomeri and Wumiri.
Sometimes it is referred to by the names it is called by neighbouring languages, such as Marityemeri, Marri Sjemirri and Murrinh Tyemerri.
Grammatical features.
Ngan’gi is a non-Pama-Nyungan language with strong head-marking properties. It has 31 finite verbs, which combine with a large class of coverbs to form morphologically complex verb words with the type of information requiring a sentence to convey in English (including information about the subject, the object and other participants). Ngan’gi also has a system of 16 noun classes (including bound prefixes and free words), which exhibit agreement properties on modifying words. Ngan’gi also has sound features which are unusual by Australian standards, including a three-way obstruent contrast; it has two series of stops, as well as phonemic fricatives.
Relationship to other languages.
The first major study of Ngan’gi was Darrell Tryon’s 1974 work, a broad discussion of Ngan’gi as one of a dozen or so "Daly family languages". Tryon viewed Ngan’gikurunggurr and Ngen’giwumirri as two languages of the "Tyemeri subgroup" of the Daly family. They are now classified with Murrinh-Patha as a Southern Daly family, a position not without problems; see Southern Daly languages for details.

Marie Vassiltchikov

Marie Illarionovna Vassiltchikov (; January 11, 1917 - August 12, 1978) was a Russian princess who wrote "Berlin Diaries, 1940-1945", which described the effects of the bombing of Berlin and events leading to the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler in the July 20 Plot.
Early life.
Princess Marie ("Missie") Vassiltchikov was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in the waning days of the Russian Empire, on January 11, 1917. She was the fourth child of a member of the Fourth Duma, Prince and his wife, the former Princess Lidiya Leonidovna Vyazemskaya. As members of the aristocracy, her parents fled Russia in 1919, following the Bolshevik October Revolution by joining a group of people who had been evacuated by the British fleet as described in the book "Purgatory of fools: A memoir of the aristocrats' war in Nazi Germany" by Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg. King George V of the United Kingdom was the cousin of the last Tzar and maternal nephew of Empress Marie Feodorovna. King George V persuaded Prime Minister David Lloyd George to send a ship to the Crimea to save his aunt but the Empress refused to leave unless those who wished to leave with her were taken as well. The British sent additional ships to take the entire group including the Vassiltchikov family. Princess Marie lived as a refugee initially in the French Third Republic, then Weimar Republic Germany, and then Lithuania until just before the start of World War II.
Plot to kill Hitler.
In 1940, Princess Marie and her sister, Princess Tatiana Vassiltchikova (Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg) (1915–2006), traveled to Berlin where, as stateless persons, they were able to obtain work permits. After a brief period of employment with the Broadcasting Service, Vassiltchikov transferred to the Auswärtiges Amt (AA), or German Foreign Ministry's Information Office, where she worked as the assistant to Dr. Adam von Trott zu Solz, a key member of the anti-Nazi resistance and a former Rhodes scholar.
Due to the tendency of Nazi party members to bypass the Foreign Ministry staff when formulating policy as described in Princess Marie's diaries, the A.A. effectively became a gathering place for civilian members of the anti-Nazi resisters including Adam von Trott zu Solz. In 1944, he was among the leaders of the July 20 Plot to kill Adolf Hitler. Princess Marie kept diaries of her life in the plotters' circle. She wrote in shorthand and kept the pages hidden in her A.A. office and in other locations but was not actively involved in the plot, although aware of its existence in general terms. In addition, her diaries detail the bombing of Berlin, the daily life of what remained of Berlin's cosmopolitan pre-war nobility and intelligentsia, and her own journey from privilege to near-death at the end of the war.
Following the failed attempt to kill Hitler, many of her friends and colleagues were imprisoned and a number were killed. Princess Marie and her friend Princess Elenore (Loremarie) von Schönburg went several times to Gestapo headquarters to plead for the life of Dr. von Trott zu Solz (among others) and to bring food and packages. Eventually, they were warned by a friendly guard not to return.
After Dr. von Trott zu Solz was executed in late August 1944, Princess Marie left Berlin and traveled to Vienna, where she worked as a nurse until the end of the war.
Post-war.
Princess Marie was found by the United States Third Army under the command of US Army General George S. Patton outside Gmunden, Austria, on May 4, 1945. She worked as an interpreter for the army, but contracted scarlet fever and was transported to a hospital unit.
On January 28, 1946, Princess Marie Vassiltchikov married U.S. Army Captain Peter Graham Harnden of Military Intelligence (born in London on April 9, 1913). They settled in Paris, where Harnden opened an architectural firm. After Harnden died in Cadaqués on October 15, 1971, she moved to London. After her husband's death, she bowed to the wishes of friends and relatives who had been encouraging her to publish her wartime diaries. She died in London of leukemia on August 12, 1978. At the time, the task of editing and polishing her diaries was still incomplete; this task was completed by her brother George Vassiltchikov, who wrote an introduction.
Princess Marie Illarionovna Harnden was survived by her four children (Marina Harnden: born September 15, 1948, Anthony Peter Harnden, born in Paris February 13, 1951, died in Cadaqués on January 4, 1999, Michael Christopher Harnden, born October 10, 1954, Alexandra Harnden, born March 18, 1956); her brother, Prince Yuri "Georgie" Vassiltchikov; and her sister, Princess Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg, who was married to Paul Alfons von Metternich-Winneburg, a descendant of Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, the prominent Austrian state chancellor and diplomat of the Napoleonic era.
Berlin Diaries.
Vassiltchikov's diaries' description of the repeated bombing of Berlin during the war is considered one of the best testimonies of that experience.
The diaries are also important in that they chronicle a little-known aspect of Hitler's war crimes: the destruction of the aristocracy of Europe. Hitler and the aristocracy had an uneasy relationship during the war. After it became clear that many of the July 20 Plot participants were members of the aristocracy, Hitler used the assassination attempt as an excuse to wipe out many members of the prominent ruling families of Europe.
A poignant feature of Vassiltchikov's diary is its arc from the first pages in 1940 to its conclusion in 1945. She begins by recounting a night spent dancing at a ball at the Chilean embassy and ends with her flight from Vienna, which found her stumbling, filthy and half-starved, across a bombed railroad depot at the end of the war. Her account of wartime Berlin at times takes on an air of surreality as she writes about days that combined lunches at the Hotel Adlon and nights spent in half-ruined flats and conversations that ranged from gossip about her noble and royal friends to the intended killing of Hitler.

Earth Changes

The phrase "Earth Changes" was coined by the American psychic Edgar Cayce to
refer to the belief that the world will soon enter on a series of cataclysmic events causing major alterations in human life on the planet.
This includes "natural events" (such as major earthquakes, the melting of the polar ice caps, a pole shift of the planetary axis, major weather events, solar flares and so on) as well as huge changes of the local and global social, economical and political systems.
Cayce.
Cayce himself also made many prophecies of cataclysmic events involving the whole planet. He claimed the polar axis would shift and that many areas that are now land would again become ocean floor, and that Atlantis would rise from the sea. The belief that the California coast would slip into the sea—a common feature of Earth Changes predictions—originated with Cayce's alleged prophecies. In more recent times, self-proclaimed psychic Gordon-Michael Scallion has issued a variety of prophecies centering on the concept of "Earth Changes" and publishes a monthly newsletter, "The Earth Changes Report".
New Age.
Cayce's term has been taken up in certain segments of the New Age movement, often associated with other predictions by people claiming to have psychic abilities. Belief in Earth changes is also found among Native Americans, some of whom refer to the concept as "the Great Purification." These beliefs have occasionally been associated with Christian millennialism and beliefs about UFOs. Some New Age adherents believe that Earth changes will preface a "Golden Age" of spirituality and world peace.
I Am America.
In the late 1980s, Lori Toye published the I Am America Map, based on several visions that she claimed to have beginning in 1983. The I Am America Map sold over 40,000 copies, and was followed by subsequent maps: Freedom Star World map, Golden Cities map, and an Earth Changes Progression series of maps. These maps represented the earth’s future geography after climatic earth changes.
Reception and interpretation.
Prophecies of Earth changes have been described as a form of pseudoscience, in which terminology and ideas borrowed from science are used to rationalize non-scriptural apocalyptical thought based on visionary experiences. David Spangler, a leader of the Findhorn Foundation spiritual community, described prophecies of Earth changes as an expression of collective fear and anger, rather than as foretelling of actual future events.

Gangnam Station

Gangnam Station is a station in the Gangnam District of Seoul, on the Seoul Subway Line 2. This station serves as a crucial transfer point between Line 2 and buses to all over Seoul and southern Gyeonggi Province. It became the northern terminus of the Shinbundang Line on October 29, 2011, the southern terminus being at Jeongja Station.
Both stations have two tracks and two side platforms.
The station.
The area surrounding the station is an important commercial and entertainment district. The station is located at the western end of Teheranno, home to many corporate headquarters and impressive towers, while the area immediately to the north of the station is densely packed with bars, restaurants and clubs. There are also many shops in the subway station below ground. In 2007, the area was the 10th most expensive shopping street in the world with an average rent of US$431 per square foot.
The section of Gangnam Boulevard from exit No.2 of this station to exit No.5 of Sinnonhyeon Station of Line 9 is designated as a smoke-free zone by the Gangnam District office.
Line 2 runs on the right hand track, whereas the Shinbundang Line runs on the left hand track; this is because the Shinbundang Line is a national railway line (which typically runs on the left), while Line 2 is a subway line (which typically runs on the right in Seoul). This can be confusing to tourists making a transfer here, as many tourists are accustomed to riding on either the left-hand track or the right-hand track.
Passenger load.
In 2007, it was the busiest subway station in the Seoul Metropolitan Subway system, with approximately 123,000 daily passengers using it on average.
In a survey conducted in 2011 by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs on 92 Administrative divisions across the country, it reported that Gangnam Station had a daily average of 110,129 people boarding and 114,338 people alighting the subway. Making this the busiest public transit stop, with more than 100,000 people every day.
Vicinity.
The headquarters of South Korean skincare and cosmetics manufacturer Skin Food is in the DaeRyung Scecho Tower in Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu nearby to this station.

William Donald Ross

William Donald Ross (June 20, 1869 – June 25, 1947), was a financier, banker and the 14th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. 
Born in 1869 in Bras d'Or, Nova Scotia, Ross went to work for the Bank of Nova Scotia emptying wastebaskets at the age of 14. The family farm had failed and Ross left school in order to help make ends meet. He rose through the ranks, becoming manager of branches in Stellarton and New Glasgow before becoming manager of the Charlottetown branch at the age of 24.
In 1901, he joined the Ministry of Finance in Ottawa before becoming general manager of the Metropolitan Bank of Toronto and moving to Toronto with his wife and children. In his new city, Ross helped find the funds to found Branksome Hall, a new private school for girls, operated by his cousin. In 1914, the Metropolitan Bank was acquired by the Bank of Nova Scotia, where Ross would ultimately become vice-president and sit on the board of directors.
Ross's first wife, Susan Archibald McGregor, died in 1909. Her father would become Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. They had three children: Donald, Isabel and Susan. He later married Isabel MacKay and they had two children: Jean and John.
A supporter of and fundraiser for the Liberal Party of Canada, Ross was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by Governor General Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon, on the advice of William Lyon Mackenzie King, in 1926. He asked to be relieved from office in 1931 due to the onset of the Great Depression as his income from private investments declined and he was no longer sufficient to supplement the $10,000 annual salary he received in his vice-regal role. 
In 1937, Ross became co-owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team. His son Donald became club president.
He died in Toronto in 1947.

Winged cat

Winged cats is a term for sightings or descriptions of cats with wing-like appendages.
There are three different causes of wing-like appendages. The most common is longhaired cats having matted fur. Felted mats of fur can form along the body and flanks if a longhaired cat is not properly groomed. Less commonly, mats can occur in shorthaired cats if molted fur adheres to growing fur over several seasons. When the cat runs, the mats flap up and down giving the impression of wings. These can be very uncomfortable for the cat and can harbour dirt, feces and parasites. Extensive mats must be shaved or clipped by a veterinarian. This explanation is ultimately untenable as the sole solution to the winged cat phenomenon, for several reasons. Many notable examples of winged cats feature shorthaired specimens. The occurrence of mats in longhaired cats is easily recognisable by experienced cat owners and breeders, but not recognisable to novices. Matted fur is not considered notable and rarely reported, except by those unfamiliar with the condition. Although mats can occur all over a longhaired cat's body, to novice eyes, they are most noticeable on the flanks when the cat is in motion.
The second explanation of reports of winged cats is a skin condition called feline cutaneous asthenia, or FCA, which is related to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (elastic skin) in humans. In winged cats that are due to FCA, the wings only occur on the shoulders, haunches, or back. Winged cats that are due to FCA can often actively move their wings, suggesting the presence of neuromuscular tissue within the wings, which is not present within clumps of matted fur alone.
The third explanation is a form of conjoining or extra limbs. These non-functional or poorly functional extra limbs would be fur-covered and might resemble wings, as in one winged cat case recently documented by Dr Karl Shuker, in which the wings were shown to be supernumerary limbs.
There are more than 138 reported sightings of animals claimed to be winged cats, though some of these are clearly nothing more than individuals with clumps of matted fur. There are over 30 documented cases (with physical evidence) and at least 20 photographs and one video. There is at least one stuffed winged cat, but this may be a nineteenth-century fake or "grift". An undated taxidermy specimen in poor condition can be found in a museum in the Niagara Valley. It has bony structures near its shoulder blades covered with flaps of skin. These might be extra limbs.
Historical winged cats.
During the early 1990s, British zoologist and cryptozoologist Dr Karl Shuker, who has a longstanding interest in the winged cat phenomenon, became the first person to make the link between winged cat reports in the popular media and reports of feline cutaneous asthenia in the veterinary literature. Publishing his findings in a series of articles appearing in several popular magazines including "Fortean Times", "Fate", "Cat World", and "All About Cats", he has compiled a comprehensive survey of winged cat cases, many previously undocumented, which he periodically updates and which may be referenced for more information. His articles include coverage of the vast majority of the following examples. In 2008, Dr Shuker published the most comprehensive documentation of winged cats currently in existence, as an extensive chapter within his book "Dr Shuker's Casebook" (CFZ Press: Bideford), including several previously unpublished cases and photographs. There are some additional, less significant examples in magazines, newspapers and personal accounts by owners, including cases of both FCA and matted longhaired cats.
Feline cutaneous asthenia.
Cutaneous asthenia ("weak skin") is a skin deformity characterised by abnormal elasticity and stretching of the skin. Pendulous wing-like folds of skin form on the cat's back, shoulders and haunches. Even stroking the cat can cause the skin to stretch and tear. The flaps may include muscle fibers allowing some movement, but the cat cannot flap them in a bird-like manner, though the wings may bounce up and down when the cat moves.
Cutaneous asthenia is caused by a collagen defect. Collagen is the protein that binds the cells of the dermis together. It is also called dermatoproxy, hereditary skin fragility or "cutis elastica" ("elastic skin") and is found in humans (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or EDS), dogs, mink, horses, cattle and sheep. In cattle and sheep, it is called dermatosparaxis ("torn skin"). In horses, a similar condition is called collagen dysplasia. The skin is also abnormally fragile. The skin flaps peel or slough off very easily, often without causing bleeding. This explains why cats with the condition suddenly "molt" their wings.
A recessive autosomal (non-sex linked) form of feline cutaneous asthenia has been identified in Siamese cats and related breeds. In the homozygous state, it is apparently lethal.
Veterinary reports.
An undated veterinary report describes a six-month-old non-pedigree tomcat which presented with two skin wounds on the right side of its body. The skin on the affected areas and on its back was hyperextensible, smooth and easily torn by just a small amount of pressure. Microscopic examination revealed abnormally low levels of connective tissue.
Cats with the condition cannot be grasped by the scruff, as this may tear away. The syndrome is also linked to slipping joints. Dietary supplements may be needed to promote skin healing and regrowth. Antibiotics may be needed to combat infection when skin has split or torn.

Frederick William Franz

Frederick William Franz (September 12, 1893 – December 22, 1992) served as President of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, the legal entity used to direct the work of Jehovah's Witnesses. He had previously served as Vice President of the same corporation from 1945 until 1977 and as a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses before replacing Nathan H. Knorr as president in June 1977.
Biography.
Franz was born on September 12, 1893 in Covington, Kentucky. He was baptized in the Lutheran Church, but attended Catholic services as a child as a matter of convenience, before later attending the Presbyterian Church. He graduated from Woodward High School in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1911 and attended the University of Cincinnati where he studied liberal arts and later (for two years) Biblical Greek, with the intention of becoming a Presbyterian preacher. He learned German and could read Latin and Greek and in later years learned Spanish, Portuguese and French and a basic understanding of Hebrew. His association with the Bible Students began after he read some of the literature of Charles Taze Russell. He was baptized as a Bible Student on either November 30, 1913, or, according to Franz, April 5, 1914.
In 1920 he joined the Watch Tower headquarters staff in Brooklyn, New York and in 1926 became a member of the editorial staff as a Bible researcher and writer for the Society’s publications. Upon the death of Watch Tower president Joseph Rutherford, Franz became head of the editorial department, and in 1945 he replaced Hayden C. Covington as vice-president of the Watch Tower Society. Franz was the Society's leading theologian and has been named as a leading figure in the preparation of the Witnesses' "New World Translation" of the Bible. His nephew and fellow Governing Body member Raymond Franz resigned from the Governing Body and was subsequently disfellowshipped in 1982 during F.W. Franz's presidency.
Franz died in Brooklyn, New York in 1992 at the age of 99 and was succeeded as president by Milton G. Henschel.

Samoans in New Zealand.
The Samoan community in New Zealand is one of the largest communities of Samoans outside of Samoa. It is made up mainly of Samoan migrants from Samoa (originally Western Samoa). There are not many in this community from American Samoa, who migrate mainly to the United States of America. The New Zealand Samoan community is a dynamic, well oganised community in that it has only been in New Zealand for about 5 to 6 decades but it has done well for itself. It has continued to thrive though it faces many challenges and problems like all other migrant groups. Many arrived in the 1940s, 1950s but the largest migration came in the 1970s, where the majority worked in factories. A generation or two later, their children began the upward mobility journey which was not easy but nevertheless resulted in the emergence of a New Zealand born young who strived to do their best. Many of these are now married with children who have continued the 'journey' and the hopes of their migrant parents and grandparents.
The community has also worked hard to try and keep its language (Samoan) alive by establishing churches and preschools as well as getting it into the New Zealand school curriculum. The Samoan language is now a degree programme at one university (Victoria University, Wellington) and is part of other degree programmes at another university (Auckland University).It is also the third most spoken language in New Zealand after English and Maori.

Cooneyites

The Cooneyites are a Protestant sect which split from the nameless church commonly known as Two by Twos; the church was originally called "the Tramps" or "the Go-Preachers" founded by William Irvine, often referred to today as "The Truth" or, confusingly, "Cooneyites". References to the term "Cooneyites" prior to 1928 refer to the group described under Two by Twos. After that time, followers who were expelled from the Two by Twos along with Edward Cooney are called "Cooneyites". In some areas, the Two by Two church, which has gone under various labels, has continued to be labeled as "Cooneyite" by outsiders up to the present. Both the Cooneyites and the Two by Twos reject the term "Cooneyite".
Edward Cooney was a noted preacher during the 1890s and early 20th century. He joined William Irvine's new movement as an itinerant evangelist. He became increasingly critical of the church's moves towards institutionalization, and was expelled in 1928, along with those who agreed with him. They formed a loose fellowship which continues to the present.
History and development.
The original group was founded by William Irvine, in Ireland in 1897. An independent evangelist, Edward Cooney, came into contact with Irvine soon afterward, though he did not join the new church immediately. In 1901, Cooney relinquished his stake in his family business. He then donated £1300 to Irvine's ministry, in fulfillment of the group's requirement to "sell all and give to the poor," and became an itinerant "tramp preacher." Cooney was noted as a powerful speaker, and was one of the most vocal of the early leaders. His name became linked to the group in the public mind.
In the early years of the 20th century, Cooney's sermons were debated in the public and press, with frequent citations of aggressively provocative remarks: "distinguished for its bitter hostility to all existing Churches, and to a regular paid ministry of any kind, reminding one not a little of the Plymouth Brethren on these and other points." Cooney was revered by some and ridiculed by others.
Later, after the group split between the followers of William Irvine, and the more numerous followers of various regional overseers, Cooney sided with the larger body, though he continued to maintain some communication with Irvine (as did other senior ministers). Instead of placing himself under a local overseer, or taking that position for himself, he continued to preach worldwide on a truly itinerant basis. He also increasingly criticized the hierarchical structure that had formed within the Two by Twos, its finances, its denial of its origins, and its having registered under a name ("The Testimony of Jesus") during WWI.
Cooney was excommunicated from the "Two by Twos" in Ireland, at a leaders' meeting, on October 12, 1928. This occurred because he refused to conform his preaching to adhere to the "Living Witness Doctrine" (which posits that faith comes from hearing the word spoken, and seeing the "gospel" physically lived, from the lips and life of a witness), and to cease preaching wherever he felt led to preach. Afterward, he continued to preach worldwide, and groups of his followers left, or were expelled from, the main group and continued in fellowship with him.
Among those who were driven out along with Cooney were prominent Two by Two pioneers such as Tom Elliot and John and Sarah West who provided continuity for the new group. However, with Cooney evangelizing in other countries during the later 1930s, the Cooneyite sect experienced a period of decline in Ireland. Despite this, Cooney was steadfast in rejecting any semblance of the hierarchy and other characteristics he had refused to accept in the main Two by Two church. He emphasized this by proclaiming, "You are not joining anything." to proselytes.
Cooney continued to win converts outside of Ireland. Followers were not organized into anything beyond loose fellowships, in accord with the abhorence of anything resembling hierarchy or organization. Some contacts were those among the Two by Twos who remembered his earlier work. Irvine Weir, one of the original Two by Two workers in North America, was excommunicated by George Walker (the head overseer in eastern North America) for breaking the ban on associating with Cooney. Others experienced expulsion for the same reason. 
Cooney had wanted to end his days in his native Ireland. However he also wished to impart a final doctrinal revelation which caused another divide among his followers there. He had come to the belief that God would grant another opportunity for repentance following death, and this caused a split within the group. Tired, ill and wishing to escape the uproar, he made a final trip to Australia, where he died in 1960.
Cooney's followers retain fond memories of him. Those who continue to follow his message are a small but still recognized sect under the name “Cooneyite” in the UK, having just over 200 members according to the 2001 UK Census. According to Roberts (1990), Cooneyite remnants exist in various places around the world and continue to meet in homes for church meetings. Notable areas include:
Doctrine and practice.
The driving force behind Edward Cooney's later preaching was a return to the original church's earlier, unstructured methods and teachings. This was one of the reasons for the schism.
A distinctive feature is public baptisms by immersion, which led some observers to link them to the various Baptists and Anabaptists. This may, instead, derive from their interpretation of the methods used by John the Baptist, as recorded in the Gospels. Cooney himself was baptised and brought up in the Church of Ireland.
Although members deny any name, the term "Cooneyites" is used to describe them by outsiders in recognition of Edward Cooney's role in the group's development.
Elements of anti-clericism which were prominent in Edward Cooney's preaching have been retained. The current group does not believe in church buildings, and meets in homes. It has not registered under and rejects any name, though they are referred to by outsiders as "Cooneyites" and acknowledge Cooney himself. The church does not hold formal conventions or have convention grounds, although it does hold occasional larger gatherings apart from the weekly home meetings. Because Cooney rejected the so-called "Living Witness" doctrine, they continue to reject that tenet. As to Christology, it seemingly continues along the original group's unitarian precepts, accepting the Father alone as God. In organization, this group is much more loosely constituted, with all members being considered equals and the leading of “the spirit” being relied upon. They do not accept a separate class or hierarchy of ministers, workers and/or overseers, believing that all members to be equal. Elders oversee individual local meetings, which is the extent of any organization.

John King (explorer)

John King (15 December 1838 – 15 January 1872) was an Irish soldier who achieved fame as an Australian explorer. He was the sole survivor of the four men from the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition who reached the Gulf of Carpentaria. The expedition was the first to cross Australia from south to north, finding a route across the continent from Melbourne in Victoria to the Gulf of Carpentaria in Queensland.
Early years.
He was born at Moy in County Tyrone, Ireland on 15 December 1838 to Henry King (d.1839) and Ellen Orn (d. September 1847). King was the youngest of four siblings;
John King was educated at the Royal Hibernian Military School at Phoenix Park in Dublin between 1847 and 1853, before joining the 70th Regiment on 15 January 1853 at the age of 14. King was sent to Chatham and then posted to India, where the Regiment had been stationed since 1848.
India.
King arrived in India on either 28 September or 29 October 1853. The regiment, under Colonel Galway and then Colonel Chute, was stationed in Cawnpore in the Northern Province. King worked as an assistant teacher in the Regimental School. He was later stationed in Peshawar in the North West Frontier Province where he was involved in some of the principal engagements during the Indian Mutiny. He suffered a severe illness and spent sixteen months convalescing in the Rawalpindi District, probably at Murree. 
While convalescing he met George Landells at Muridke. George James Landells had been sent to India by the Victorian Government to purchase 24 camels to be used for exploration of the Australian desert. King obtained his army discharge in Rawalpindi in January 1860 and then travelled to Karachi where he was engaged by Landells to supervise the sepoys who had charge of the camels. Landells, King, two other Europeans, eight Indian sepoys and 24 camels sailed for Melbourne aboard the S.S. "Chinsurah" on 30 March 1860.
Australia.
King arrived in Melbourne on 8 June 1860. The camels were offloaded a week later and accommodated at the Victorian Parliament House stables in Spring Street. They were later moved to newly constructed stables at Royal Park from whence the Expedition left.
Burke and Wills expedition.
Robert O'Hara Burke was appointed leader of the Victorian Exploring Expedition with Landells as second-in-command. William John Wills was surveyor and astronomical observer and King was appointed as one of the Expedition Assistants on a salary of £120 a year. 
The expedition left Melbourne on Monday, 20 August 1860 with a total of 19 men, 27 camels and 23 horses. They reached Menindee on 16 October 1860 where Landells resigned following an argument with Burke. Wills was promoted to second-in-command and King was placed in charge of the camels.
Burke split the expedition at Menindee and the lead party reached Cooper Creek on 11 November 1860 where they formed a depot. The remaining men were expected to follow up from Menindee and so after a break, Burke decided to make a dash to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Burke split the party again and left on 16 December 1860, placing William Brahe in charge of the depot on Cooper Creek. Burke, Wills, King and Charley Gray reached the mangroves on the estuary of the Flinders River, near where the town of Normanton now stands, on 9 February 1861. Flooding rains and swamps meant they never saw open ocean. 
Already weakened by starvation and exposure, progress on the return journey was slow and hampered by the tropical monsoon downpours of the wet season. Gray died four days before they reached the depot at Cooper Creek and the other three took a day to bury him. They eventually reached the depot on Sunday, 21 April 1861 to find the men had not arrived from Menindee and Brahe and the Depot Party had given up waiting and left just 9 hours earlier. Brahe had buried a note and some food underneath a tree which is now known as the "Dig Tree".
Burke, Wills and King attempted to reach Mount Hopeless, the furthest extent of settlement in South Australia, which was closer than Menindee, but failed and returned to Cooper Creek. While waiting for rescue Burke and Wills died of exhaustion and starvation. The exact date of their deaths is uncertain, but has generally been accepted to be 28 June 1861.
King survived with the help of Aborigines until he was rescued in September by Alfred William Howitt. Howitt buried Burke and Wills before returning to Melbourne.
After the expedition.
When Howitt got to Menindee he sent King on ahead to Melbourne, escorted by Edwin Welch and Weston Phillips. King arrived back in Melbourne on 29 November 1861 where he was hailed as a hero and mobbed by the admiring colonists of Victoria. King received a gold watch and a pension of £180 a year from the Royal Society of Victoria. 
King was cared for by his sister, Elizabeth, at her house in Westbury Street, St Kilda. In 1863 he went to Tasmania to see if it would aid his recovery, arriving in Hobart on the SS "Black Swan" on Sunday, 1 February. King returned to Melbourne and was present at the inauguration of the Burke & Wills statue on the corner of Collins and Russell Streets in Melbourne on 21 April 1865, the fourth anniversary of their return to Cooper Creek. 
In 1865 he bought a house in Octavia Street, St Kilda, and on 22 August 1871 he married his cousin, Mary Richmond, at the Wesley Church on Lonsdale Street. King never fully recovered from the privations suffered while on the expedition, and in 1869 his health began to deteriorate. During November and December 1871 he was so ill he was cared for at his sister's house in Drummond Street, Carlton. He returned home to St Kilda and died prematurely of pulmonary tuberculosis on 15 January 1872 aged 33. His pall-bearers were Ferdinand von Mueller, Dr David Wilkie and Inspector James M Gilmour. He is buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery.

New Forms

New Forms is the debut album by the drum and bass act Roni Size / Reprazent and was released in 1997. The double-disc set was the winner of the Mercury Music Prize in 1997, and often cited as their magnum opus.
A companion remix album, "Replica", was also released. It includes "Western", the UK b-side of the "Brown Paper Bag" single, along with various remixes of album tracks.
The album went on to be re-recorded as "New Forms²" in 2008.
Releases.
The album was released in various formats with slightly different track lists. In the UK, there was a 2CD version and a single disc edition, and the vinyl was released in both 4LP and 5LP versions. Of the two vinyl versions, the most common pressing is the 4LP version comprising most of the first CD; the 5LP set includes tracks from the second CD, replacing "Intro" with "Heroes" and "Digital", which are appended to the end.
In the US, only the 2CD version was released, though this contained the bonus track of "Electricks".
Reception.
Commercial performance.
"New Forms" entered the UK Albums Chart during the week ending 5 July 1997 and peaked at number 8. By September 2011, the album had sold 325,000 copies in the United Kingdom since its release.
Critical response.
"New Forms" was released to generally favourable reviews. Allmusic described the album as "the major statement on drum'n'bass", while in 2010 BBC Music noted that it "carved a mainstream niche for drum and bass like no album before it". Pitchfork Media's Ryan Schreiber was less generous, commenting that the album "doesn't really get decent until the second half of disc one".
"New Forms²".
New Forms² is a 2008 remake of the original "New Forms" album. Roni Size has described it as having a ""new coat of armour added to the original tracks"". The album contains four new songs: "Heart to Heart", "Less is More", "Don't Hold Back" and "Encore", while omitting several of the songs from the original pressing. The majority of the record features edited versions of previous tracks, with segues throughout. The most drastic cuts occur to "Brown Paper Bag" and "Let's Get It On", which are reduced by over five minutes each; the latter becoming a simple ambient interlude.

Italian Concerto (Bach)

The Italian Concerto, BWV 971, original title: Concerto nach Italienischem Gusto (Concerto after the Italian taste), published in 1735 as the first half of Clavier-Übung II (the second half being the "French Overture") is a three-movement concerto for two-manual harpsichord solo composed by Johann Sebastian Bach. The "Italian Concerto" has become popular among Bach's keyboard works, and has been widely recorded both on the harpsichord and the piano. 
Movements:
The "Italian Concerto"'s two lively F major outer movements, in ritornello style, frame a florid arioso-style movement in D minor, the relative minor.
An Italian concerto relies upon the contrasting roles of different groups of instruments in an ensemble; Bach imitates this effect by creating contrasts using the "forte" and "piano" manuals of a two-manual harpsichord throughout the piece. In fact, along with the "French Overture" and some of the "Goldberg Variations", this is one of the few works by Bach which specifically require a 2-manual harpsichord.
Bach also transcribed Italian concertos by Vivaldi and others for solo harpsichord (BWV 972-987), and for solo organ or pedal harpsichord (BWV 592-596).

Mokokchung

Mokokchung (Pron:/ˌməʊkɒkˈtʃʌŋ/) is a town and a municipality in Mokokchung district in the Indian state of Nagaland. It is the district headquarters as well as the main urban hub of Mokokchung district. Mokokchung is the cultural nervecentre of the Ao people and is economically and politically the most important urban centre in northern Nagaland. In fact it is third most important urban hub in all of Nagaland after Dimapur and Kohima. The town is made up of 16 wards of which Kumlong, Sangtemla, Alempang and Yimyu are the largest. Mokokchung is particularly noted for its extravagant Christmas, New Year, Moatsu and Tsungremong celebrations. Its tradition of celebrating Christmas and New Year midnight celebrations in the main town square is regarded as one of the unique features of Mokokchung. Historically, Mokokchung was one of the first Naga Hills sites where the Assam Rifles, led by Britishers, established their outposts (then called stockades) in the later part of 19th century. Much of the town initially grew around this post located in the DC Hill. The British administration was then gradually extended eastwards towards the remoter parts of the Naga Hills.
Geography.
Mokokchung is located at . It is located at an elevation of 1325 metres above sea level.
Mokokchung has a mild climate throughout the year. For ten months of the year, maximum temperature hovers in the mid twenties. Mokokchung also witnesses a lot of mist in the rainy months.
Highways.
Mokokchung's central location has helped it to be the converging point of maximum number of highways and hence it is better connected to most areas of Nagaland when compared to Kohima and Dimapur. Besides,every village and settlement of the district is well linked to the town by district and community roads.
Major Highways passing through Mokokchung are:
Demographics.
The population is predominantly Ao, as the town is the heart and the cultural centre of the Aos. The town is redolent with their history and cultural practices. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OgPt6vp1bM] 
Satellite towns (sub urban areas) of Mokokchung.
Dimapur and Mokokchung are the only towns in Nagaland with a significant sub urban population. Mokokchung is the hub of Mokokchung Metropolitan Area, a term which refers to the continuous settlements from Alichen in the south, through Mokokchung town up to Amenyong and Khensa in the North West; and from Mokokchung town through Fazl Ali College up to DEF colony in the North East.
The trend of sub urbanization in Mokokchung ( which had started in Western countries in the sixties) started in the eighties with the mushrooming of satellite towns like Yimyu and Marepkong. Today, the urban settlement has spilled outside the historical boundary of Mokokchung town. This trend has speeded up (since the late nineties) so much so that the erstwhile satellite town of Yimyu boomed and spread towards Mokokchung and became conjoined with it. Today it has become a ward of Mokokchung. As a result of this flight to the suburbs, population growth in Mokokchung town (the area under the municipality comprising the fifteen wards) has slowed down while the satellite towns are booming.
Besides, the following villages have been engulfed by the spiralling urban spread of Mokokchung and have acquired urban characteristics. In fact, though not part of the municipality, they have become very much a part of Mokokchung and are confused by many tourists as being localities of the town.
People are now living miles away from the main town in smaller suburbs as well as villages, who drive to work daily to the main town. This phenomenon is in sharp contrast to other towns in Nagaland like Kohima, Wokha and Zunheboto where an overwhelming majority of the population tend to be concentrated in the main town.
Religion.
Christianity is the predominant religion of Mokokchung, with more than 95% of the population being Baptist. The Aos were the first of the Nagaland peoples to embrace Christianity in the 19th century, and the area is the hub of India's Baptist belt. The revivalist movement that swept the entire state of Nagaland in the 1970s originated in Mokokchung District and Mokokchung was a major centre. Impur, 15 kilometres away, is the centre of the Ao Baptist Arogo Mungdang (Ao Baptist Churches Convention). The main town Baptist church, located at the heart of the town, is one of the largest churches in Asia.
The other religions and faiths practiced in Mokokchung - mainly by immigrant business community from mainland India - are Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam.
Art and Culture.
Mokokchung is the intellectual and cultural capital of Nagaland. From the late 19th century, through the 20th century and continuing in the present times, the sons and daughters of Mokokchung have excelled and led the state in every field. Mokokchung is the home and venue of "Naga Idol", a talent search contest on the lines of "American Idol". Naga Idol show holds the distinction of having garnered the highest TV viewership and record sales in Nagaland. It official website is http://www.nagaidol.com
Politics.
Mokokchung has political importance in Nagaland. Apart from Mokokchung town constituency, parts of the town fall under three other state assembly constituencies—namely, Aonglenden and Mongoya—thus making the town the deciding factor in 3 of 60 assembly seats in the state legislature. Leaders from the town played a major role in brokering a deal with the Government of India at the height of the Indo-Naga conflict in the 1950s, resulting in the formation of Nagaland state as the 16th state of India in 1963.
Over the last two decades, Mokokchung has become a stronghold of the Indian National Congress party which can be partly attributed to the fact that the party was led by S. Chubatoshi Jamir whose constituency was Aonglenden. In the 2003 general Assembly elections, Indian National Congress won Aonglenden, Mongoya and Mokokchung town constituencies while Koridang constituency was won by an Independent candidate.

Body of Doctrine

Body of Doctrine (Latin: "Corpus doctrinae") in Protestant theology of the 16th and 17th centuries is the anthology of the confessional or credal writings of a group of Christians with a common confession of faith. 
It was a term first used by Philipp Melanchthon, a collection of whose confessional writings was published as the "Corpus Doctrinae Philippicum" or the "Corpus Doctrinae Misnicum". Melanchthon had conceived the notion of assembling his most important theological writings, along with the ecumenical creeds, into a single book called a "corpus doctrinae", or body of doctrine. The Leipzig printer, Ernst Vögelin, published it with Melanchthon’s preface around the time of the reformer’s death in April 1560.
These writings were used as the normative proclamation and teaching of that group or denomination of Christians. For Lutheranism in the mid—16th century these anthologies were formulated for the various duchies and principalities of the Holy Roman Empire. They were the prototype of the Book of Concord, which historically is considered by Lutherans to be their definitive "Body of Doctrine". However, because some of the "corpera doctrinæ" were considered to be faulty and to avoid confusion of the Book of Concord with the "Corpus doctrinæ Philippicum", the compilers of the Book of Concord deliberately refrained from using the designation "corpus doctrinæ" for it.

Robert Aumann

Robert John Aumann (Hebrew name: , "Yisrael Aumann"; born June 8, 1930) is an Israeli-American mathematician and a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences. He is a professor at the Center for the Study of Rationality in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He also holds a visiting position at Stony Brook University and is one of the founding members of the Center for Game Theory in Economics at Stony Brook.
Aumann received the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, sometimes referred to as "Nobel prize" for economics, see Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, in 2005 for his work on conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis. He shared the prize with Thomas Schelling.
Biography.
Early years.
Aumann was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and fled to the United States with his family in 1938, two weeks before the Kristallnacht pogrom. He attended the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School, a yeshiva high school in New York City. He graduated from the City College of New York in 1950 with a B.Sc. in Mathematics. He received his M.Sc. in 1952, and his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1955, both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His doctoral dissertation, "Asphericity of Alternating Linkages", concerned knot theory. His advisor was George Whitehead, Jr.
In 1956 he joined the Mathematics faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and has been a visiting professor at Stony Brook University since 1989.
Scientific contribution.
Aumann's greatest contribution was in the realm of repeated games, which are situations in which players encounter the same situation over and over again.
Aumann was the first to define the concept of correlated equilibrium in game theory, which is a type of equilibrium in non-cooperative games that is more flexible than the classical Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, Aumann has introduced the first purely formal account of the notion of common knowledge in game theory. He collaborated with Lloyd Shapley on the Aumann-Shapley value. He is also known for his agreement theorem, in which he argues that under his given conditions, two Bayesian rationalists with common prior beliefs cannot agree to disagree.
Aumann and Maschler used Game Theory also to analyze Talmudic dilemmas. They were able to solve the mystery about the "division problem", a longstanding dilemma of explaining the Talmudic rationale in dividing the heritage of a late husband to his three wives depending on the worth of the heritage compared to its original worth. The article in that matter was dedicated to a son of Aumann, Shlomo, who was killed during the 1982 Lebanon War while serving as a tank gunner in the Israel Defense Forces's armored corps.
These are some of the themes of Aumann's Nobel lecture, named "War and Peace":
Political views.
Aumann is a member in the Professors for a Strong Israel (PSI), a right-wing political group. Aumann opposed the disengagement from Gaza in 2005 claiming it is a crime against Gush Katif settlers and a serious threat to the security of Israel. Aumann draws on a case in game theory called the Blackmailer Paradox to demonstrate that giving land to the Arabs is strategically foolish based on the mathematical theory. By presenting an unyielding demand, the Arab states force Israel to "yield to blackmail due to the perception that it will leave the negotiating room with nothing if it is inflexible."
As a result of his political views, and his use of his research to justify them, the decision to give him the Nobel prize was criticized in the European press. A petition to cancel his prize garnered signatures from 1,000 academics worldwide.
In a speech to a religious Zionist youth movement, Bnei Akiva, Aumann claimed that Israel is in 'deep trouble'. He revealed his belief that the anti-Zionist Satmar Jews might have been right in their condemnation of the original Zionist movement. “I fear the Satmars were right.” he said, and quoted a verse: “Unless the Lord builds a house, its builders toil on it in vain.” (Psalm 127) Aumann feels that the historical Zionist establishment failed to transmit its message to its successors, because it was secular. The only way that Zionism can survive, according to Aumann, is if it has a religious basis.
In 2008, Aumann joined the new political party Ahi led by Effi Eitam and Yitzhak Levy.
Torah codes controversy.
Aumann has entered the controversy of Bible codes research. In his position as both a religious Jew and a man of science, the codes research holds special interest to him. He has partially vouched for the validity of the "Great Rabbis Experiment" (see bible code article) by Doron Witztum, Eliyahu Rips, and Yoav Rosenberg, which was published in "Statistical Science". Aumann not only arranged for Rips to give a lecture on Torah codes in the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, but sponsored the Witztum-Rips-Rosenberg paper for publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The Academy requires a member to sponsor any publication in its Proceedings; the paper was turned down however.
In 1996, a committee consisting of Robert J. Aumann, Dror Bar-Natan, Hillel Furstenberg, Isaak Lapides, and Rips, was formed to examine the results that had been reported by H.J. Gans regarding the existence of "encoded" text in the bible foretelling events that took place many years after the Bible was written. The committee performed two additional tests in the spirit of the Gans experiments. Both tests failed to confirm the existence of the putative code.
After a long analysis of the experiment and the dynamics of the controversy, stating for example that "almost everybody included the controversy made up their mind early in the game" Aumann concluded:
""A priori", the thesis of the Codes research seems wildly improbable... Research conducted under my own supervision failed to confirm the existence of the codes – though it also did not establish their non-existence. So I must return to my "a priori" estimate, that the Codes phenomenon is improbable".
Personal life.
Aumann married Esther Schlesinger in April 1955 in Brooklyn. They had met in 1953 when Esther, who was from Israel, was visiting the United States. The couple had five children; the oldest, Shlomo, was killed in action in 1982, while serving in the Israeli Army in the 1982 Lebanon War. Esther died of ovarian cancer in October 1998. In late November 2005, Aumann married Esther's widowed sister, Batya Cohn.

Charles Shirreff

Charles Shirreff (July 26, 1768 – May 5, 1847) was an early Canadian businessman and public official.
He was born in Leith, Scotland in 1768. In 1817, he migrated to Smith's Creek, later Port Hope, in Upper Canada. He obtained a grant of land in Fitzroy Township in the upper Ottawa Valley and moved there in 1818. He founded the town of Fitzroy Harbour, Ontario on the Ottawa River in 1831 and built a grist mill there.
His son, Robert, took the post of deputy surveyor general of woods, which regulated tree cutting on public lands in Upper and Lower Canada by collecting dues. Shirreff set up an informal arrangement where he measured the timber at Bytown and Robert collected the dues at Quebec City where the rafts of timber were sold. Shirreff proposed a new system, which was accepted in 1832, where a system of timber limits was used to control the cutting of trees on crown lands. A down payment was paid by the lumber company and then the fees were paid in full when the timber was sold.
This system was challenged in 1832 on the Gatineau River due to illegal cutting along the river; this area was exempted from public sale of timber limits. Although Shirreff protested, the "Gatineau Privilege" remained in place. A scandal surfaced when the company managing affairs at Quebec went bankrupt; it was discovered that they had been accepting promissory notes rather than bonds, resulting in lost revenue to the provinces. The Shirreffs were replaced in the Bytown office in 1836. Charles continued to expand his business interests at Fitzroy Harbour, adding a sawmill and a store.
During the 1830s, Shirreff promoted a plan to connect the Ottawa River to Georgian Bay via a canal.
Shirreff died in Bytown in 1847.

Bragar

Bragar () is a village on the west side of the Isle of Lewis in Scotland, 14 miles from the island's only town, Stornoway.
Residents are mainly Gaelic speaking, and many work as crofters.
The village's best-known landmark is a whalebone arch, made in 1921 from the jawbone of an 80 foot long blue whale which was beached on the shore the year before. It also has a post office, a war memorial, and a school.
A ruined Iron Age broch, Dun Bragar, stands in Loch an Dùin in South Bragar, 80 metres from the road and connected to the lochside by a causeway. In the mid-20th century local people took away many of its stones, and the structure is no longer safe.
The remains of a chapel, Teampall Eòin (the Temple of John the Baptist), built in the 15th century or earlier, lie inside a walled compound. This also contains a cemetery, now known as Cill Sgàire (Zechariah's cemetery) after Zechariah MacAulay who fell in a skirmish between the MacAulays of Uig and the Morrisons of Ness.
Rory 'Dall' Morison (Roderick Morrison), an Clàrsair Dall, the harpist who wrote Òran Mòr MhicLeòid, was born in Bragar in 1656.

Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever

Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell the Truth Shall Live Forever is the second album recorded by post-rock band Explosions in the Sky, released on September 4, 2001. It is their first album released on the Temporary Residence label.
Overview.
The band also garnered a small amount of media attention as the liner notes of this album contained a picture of an airplane and the text "This Plane Will Crash Tomorrow". A rumor circulated that the album was released on September 10, 2001, the day before the September 11, 2001 attacks, but this is untrue. According to Amazon.com, the album was officially released September 4, 2001, exactly one week before the attacks. An interview with "Stylus" claims the album was available as early as August 24, 2001. Members of the band told "Stylus" that they had the artwork and idea for the liner notes for over a year before the attacks on the World Trade Center.
The track "Have You Passed Through This Night?" is one of the few Explosions in the Sky songs to contain any words: a sample of the narration from the film "The Thin Red Line".
The track "The Moon Is Down" was based on "The Moon Is Down" by author John Steinbeck.
The track title "With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept" was used as an episode title for an episode of season three of the television show "One Tree Hill".
The artwork for the album, by David Logan, was inspired by the Angels of Mons.

Salix pentandra

Salix pentandra (bay willow) is a species of willow native to northern Europe and northern Asia.
It is a large shrub or small tree growing to tall (rarely to 17 m), usually growing in wet, boggy ground. The leaves are glossy dark green, 5-12 cm long and 2-5 cm broad, with finely serrated margins. The dioecious flowers are catkins, produced in late spring after the leaves; the male catkins are yellow, 2-5 cm long, the female catkins greenish, 1.5-3 cm long; they are pollinated by bees. The fruit is a small capsule containing numerous minute seeds embedded in white down which aids wind dispersal.
The scientific name refers to the male flowers having five stamens. The English name derives from the resemblance of the leaves to those of the bay laurel; other common names include bay-leaved willow and laurel willow. Its glossy leaves make it more decorative than many other willows, so it is often planted as an ornamental tree.
It has become locally naturalised in northern North America, and is widely known as laurel-leaf willow there.

Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania

The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is a non-stock, not-for-profit organization headquartered in the New York City, New York borough of Brooklyn. It is the main legal entity used worldwide by Jehovah's Witnesses to direct, administer and develop doctrines for the religion and is often referred to by members of the religion simply as "the Society". It is the parent organization of a number of Watch Tower subsidiaries, including the Watchtower Society of New York and International Bible Students Association. The number of voting shareholders of the corporation is limited to between 300 and 500 "mature, active and faithful" male Jehovah's Witnesses. About 5800 Jehovah's Witnesses provide voluntary unpaid labour, as members of a religious order, in three large Watch Tower Society facilities in New York; nearly 15,000 other members of the order work at the Watch Tower Society's other facilities worldwide.
The organization was formed in 1881 as "Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society" for the purpose of distributing religious tracts. The society was incorporated in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 15, 1884. In 1896, the society was renamed "Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society". Following a leadership dispute in the Bible Student movement, the Watch Tower Society remained associated with the branch of the movement that became known as Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1955, the corporation was renamed "Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania". In 1976, all activities of the Watch Tower Society were brought under the supervision of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses.
History.
On February 16, 1881, Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society was formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, for the purpose of organizing the printing and distribution of religious tracts. William Henry Conley, a Pittsburgh industrialist and philanthropist, served as president, with Charles Taze Russell serving as secretary-treasurer. The society's primary journal was "Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christs Presence", first published in 1879 by Russell, founder of the Bible Student movement. Other early writers for the Watch Tower Society included J. H. Paton and W. I. Mann. Formation of the society was announced in the April 1881 issue of "Zion's Watch Tower". That year, the society received donations of $35,391.18.
Incorporation.
On December 15, 1884, the society was incorporated as Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society in Pennsylvania as a non-profit, non-stock corporation with Russell as president. The corporation was located in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. In its charter, written by Russell, the society's purpose was stated as "the mental, moral and religious improvement of men and women, by teaching the Bible by means of the publication and distribution of Bibles, books, papers, pamphlets and other Bible literature, and by providing oral lectures free for the people". The charter provided for a board of seven directors, three of who served as officers—a president, vice-president (initially William I. Mann) and secretary-treasurer (initially Maria Russell). The charter stipulated that the officers be chosen from the directors and be elected annually by ballot. Board members would hold office for life unless removed by a two-thirds vote by shareholders. Vacancies on the board resulting from death, resignation or removal would be filled by a majority vote of the remaining board members within 20 days; if such vacancies were not filled within 30 days an appointment could be made by the president, with the appointments lasting only until the next annual corporation meeting, when vacancies would be filled by election.
Anyone subscribing to $10 or more of the society's "Old Testament Tracts" or donating $10 or more to the society was deemed a voting member and entitled to one vote per $10 donated. Russell indicated that despite having a board and shareholders, the society would be directed by only two people—him and his wife Maria. Russell said that as at December 1893 he and his wife owned 3705, or 58 percent, of the 6383 voting shares, "and thus control the Society; and this was fully understood by the directors from the first. Their usefulness, it was understood, would come to the front in the event of our death... For this reason, also, formal elections were not held; because it would be a mere farce, a deception, to call together voting shareholders from all over the world, at great expense, to find upon arrival that their coming was useless, Sister Russell and myself having more than a majority over all that could gather. However, no one was hindered from attending such elections." The influx of donations gradually diluted the proportion of the Russells' shares and in 1908 their voting shares constituted less than half the total. Russell emphasized the limitations of the corporation, explaining: "Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society is not a 'religious society' in the ordinary meaning of this term" He also stated, "This is a business association merely... It has no creed or confession. It is merely a business convenience in disseminating the truth." Incorporation of the society meant that it would outlive Russell, so individuals who wished to bequeath their money or property to him would not have to alter their will if he died before they did. On September 19, 1896, the name of the corporation was changed to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.
From 1908 Russell required the directors to write out resignations when they were appointed so Russell could dismiss them by simply filling in the date. In 1909, Russell instructed legal counsel Joseph Franklin Rutherford to determine whether the society's headquarters could be moved to Brooklyn, New York. Rutherford reported that because it had been established under Pennsylvania law, the corporation could not be registered in New York state, but suggested that a new corporation be registered there to do the society's work. Rutherford subsequently organized the formation of the People's Pulpit Association, which was incorporated on February 23, 1909, and wrote the charter which gave the president—to be elected for life at the first meeting—"absolute power and control" of its activities in New York. The society sold its buildings in Pittsburgh and moved staff to its new base in Brooklyn. Although all New York property was bought in the name of the New York corporation and all legal affairs of the society done in its name, Russell insisted on the continued use of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society name on all correspondence and publications.
The move from Pennsylvania to New York occurred during court proceedings over the breakdown of Russells' marriage. His wife Maria had been granted a "limited divorce" on March 4, 1908, but in 1909 returned to court in Pittsburgh to request an increase in alimony, which her former husband refused. Authors Barbara Grizzuti Harrison and Edmond C. Gruss have claimed Russell's move to Brooklyn was motivated by his desire to transfer from the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania courts. They claim he transferred all his assets to the Watch Tower Society so he could declare himself bankrupt and avoid being jailed for failure to pay alimony.
In 1914, the International Bible Students Association was incorporated in Britain to administer affairs in that country. Like the People's Pulpit Association, it was subsidiary to the Pennsylvania parent organization and all work done through both subsidiaries was described as the work of the Watch Tower Society. "The Watchtower" noted: "The editor of "The Watchtower" is the President of all three of these Societies. All financial responsibility connected with the work proceeds from Pennsylvania corporation. From it the other Societies and all the branches of the work receive their financial support... we use sometimes the one name and sometimes the other in various parts of our work—yet they all in the end mean the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, to which all donations should be made."
Leadership dispute.
Russell died on October 31, 1916, in Pampa, Texas during a cross-country preaching trip. On January 6, 1917, board member and society legal counsel Joseph Franklin Rutherford, aged 47, was elected president of the Watch Tower Society, unopposed, at the Pittsburgh convention. Under his presidency, the role of the society underwent a major change. By-laws passed by both the Pittsburgh convention and the board of directors stated that the president would be the executive officer and general manager of the society, giving him full charge of its affairs worldwide.
By June 1917, four of the seven Watch Tower Society directors, Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright, had decided they had erred in endorsing Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming Rutherford had become autocratic. Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the powers of management from the president, but Rutherford later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, Rutherford gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society.
On July 12, 1917, Rutherford filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing A. H. Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed Rutherford had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8, 1917. On January 5, 1918, Rutherford was returned to office.
In May 1918, Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower directors and officers were arrested on charges of sedition under the Espionage Act. On June 21, 1918, they were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Rutherford feared his opponents would gain control of the Society in his absence, but on January 2, 1919, he learned he had been re-elected president at the Pittsburgh convention the day before. However, by mid-1919 about one in seven Bible Students had chosen to leave rather than accept Rutherford's leadership, forming groups such as The Standfast Movement, Paul Johnson Movement, Dawn Bible Students Association, Pastoral Bible Institute of Brooklyn, Elijah Voice Movement and Eagle Society.
Although formed as a "business convenience" with the purpose of publishing and distributing Bible-based literature and managing the funds necessary for that task, the corporation from the 1920s began its transformation into the "religious society" Russell had insisted it was not, introducing centralized control and regulation of Bible Student congregations worldwide. In 1938, Rutherford introduced the term "theocracy" to describe the hierarchical leadership of Jehovah's Witnesses, with "Consolation" explaining: "The Theocracy is at present administered by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, of which Judge Rutherford is the president and general manager." The society appointed "zone servants" to supervise congregations and in a "Watchtower" article Rutherford declared the need for congregations to "get in line" with the changed structure.
Amendments to charter.
Following Rutherford's death in 1942, Nathan H. Knorr became president of the Watch Tower Society, and subsequently introduced further changes to the role of the society. At a series of talks given in Pittsburgh on September 30, 1944, coinciding with the society's annual meeting, it was announced that changes would be made to the 1884 charter to bring it into "closer harmony with theocratic principles". The amendments, most of which were passed unanimously, significantly altered the terms of membership and stated for the first time that the society's purposes included preaching about God's kingdom, acting as a servant and governing agency of Jehovah's Witnesses, and sending missionaries and teachers for the public worship of God and Jesus Christ. The new charter, which took effect from January 1, 1945 included the following changes:
Governing Body.
In 1976, direction of the Watch Tower Society and of the congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide came under the control of the Governing Body, reducing the power of the society's president. The society has described the change as "one of the most significant organizational readjustments in the modern-day history of Jehovah's Witnesses."
Following the death of Knorr in 1977, subsequent presidents of the Watch Tower Society have been Frederick W. Franz (June 1977 – December 1992); Milton G. Henschel (December 1992 – October 2000) and Don A. Adams (October 2000–).
Operations.
The corporation is a major publisher of religious publications, including books, tracts, magazines and Bibles. By 1979, the society had 39 printing branches worldwide. In 1990, it was reported that in one year the society printed 696 million copies of its magazines, "The Watchtower" and "Awake!" as well as another 35,811,000 pieces of literature worldwide, which are offered door-to-door by Jehovah's Witnesses. As of 2013, the Society prints more than 43 million of its public issues of these magazines each month, totaling over 1 billion annually.
The society describes its headquarters and branch office staff as volunteers rather than employees, and identifies them as members of the Worldwide Order of Special Full-Time Servants of Jehovah's Witnesses. Workers receive a small monthly stipend with meals and accommodation provided by the society. The "Bethel family" in the Brooklyn headquarters includes hairdressers, dentists, doctors, housekeepers and carpenters, as well as shops for repairing personal appliances, watches, shoes and clothing without charge for labor.
The society files no publicly accessible financial figures, but reported in 2011 that it had spent more than $173 million that year "in caring for special pioneers, missionaries and traveling overseers in their field service assignments". Donations obtained from the distribution of literature is a major source of income, most of which is used to promote its evangelical activities.
Author James Beckford has claimed the status of voting members of the society is purely symbolic. He said they cannot be considered to be representatives of the mass of Jehovah's Witnesses and are in no position to challenge the actions or authority of the society's directors.
Property ownership.
United States.
The corporation was first located at 44 Federal Street, Allegheny, Pennsylvania (the city was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907), but in 1889 moved to "Bible House", newly built premises at 56–60 Arch Street, Allegheny, owned by Russell's privately owned Tower Publishing Company. The new building contained an assembly hall seating about 200, as well as editorial, printing and shipping facilities and living quarters for some staff. The title for the building was transferred in April 1898 to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.
In 1909, the society moved its base to Brooklyn. A four-story brownstone parsonage formerly owned by Congregationalist clergyman and social reformer Henry Ward Beecher at 124 Columbia Heights was converted to a residence for a headquarters staff of 30, as well as an office for Russell. A former Plymouth church building at 13–17 Hicks Street was also purchased and converted into Watch Tower headquarters, with room for 350 staff. It contained an 800-seat assembly hall, shipping department and printing facilities. "The Watch Tower" announced: "The new home we shall call 'Bethel,' and the new office and auditorium, 'The Brooklyn Tabernacle'; these names will supplant the term 'Bible House.'" In October 1909, an adjoining building at 122 Columbia Heights was bought. In 1911, a new nine-story residential block was built at the rear of the headquarters, fronting on Furman Street and overlooking the Brooklyn waterfront. The Brooklyn Tabernacle was sold in 1918 or 1919.
Printing facilities were established in Myrtle Street, Brooklyn in 1920 and from the February 1, 1920 issue "The Watch Tower" was printed by the society at the plant. Two months later the plant began printing "The Golden Age". In 1922, the printing factory was moved to a six-story building at 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn; four years later it moved again to larger premises, a new eight-story building at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, at which time the society's headquarters was rebuilt and enlarged. In December 1926, a building at 126 Columbia Heights was bought, and a month later the three buildings from 122–126 Columbia Heights were demolished and rebuilt for accommodation and executive offices, using the official address of 124 Columbia Heights.
In 1946, property surrounding the Adams Street factory was bought to expand printing operations (when completed in 1949 the factory occupied an entire block bounded by Adams, Sands Pearl and Prospect Streets) and five more properties adjoining 124 Columbia Heights were purchased for a 10-story building. In the late 1950s a property at 107 Columbia Heights, across the road from 124 Columbia Heights, was bought and by 1960 a residential building for staff was constructed there. More residences were built at 119 Columbia Heights in 1969.
"The Watchtower" detailed further expansion in the 1950s and 1960s: "In 1956, a 13-story building was constructed at 77 Sands Street. Then just across the street, another (10-story building) was purchased in 1958. In 1968, an adjoining 11-story new printing factory was completed. Along with the factory at 117 Adams Street, these fill out four city blocks of factories that are all tied together by overhead bridges. Then in November 1969, the Squibb complex located a few blocks away was purchased."
The society bought the Towers Hotel at 79–99 Willow Street in 1974 for accommodation, which is connected to the society's other Columbia Heights properties via underground tunnels. In 1978, a property at 25 Columbia Heights underwent renovation for use as offices and in the early 1980s properties were bought at 175 Pearl Street and 360 Furman Street for factory and office use. A building at 360 Furman Street was bought in March 1983 and renovated, providing almost 9 hectares of floor space for shipping, carpentry and construction. The Bossert Hotel at 98 Montague Street was also bought in 1983 as a residence building. 97 Columbia Heights, the former site of the Margaret Hotel, was purchased in 1986 as it was ideally located next to WTBTS residences at 107 and 124 Columbia Heights and it could easily tie in with the main complex on the other side of the street by means of an under-street tunnel. An 11-story residential building was erected on the site to house 250 workers. A property at 90 Sands Street was also bought in December 1986 and a 30-story residential building for 1000 workers was completed on the site in 1995. A 1996 publication listed other Watch Tower residential buildings in Brooklyn including the 12-story Bossert Hotel, 34 Orange Street (1945), Standish Arms Hotel at 169 Columbia Heights (1981), 67 Livingston Street (1989), and 108 Joralemon Street (1988).
Two properties known as Watchtower Farms, at Wallkill, 160 km north of Brooklyn and totaling 1200 hectares, were bought in 1963 and 1967 and factories erected in 1973 and 1975. 2012-2014 the Society is adding an office building, residence building and garage. In 1984, the society paid $2.1 million for a 270 hectare farm at Patterson, New York for a development that would include 624 apartments, garages for 800 cars and a 149-room hotel. Other rural purchases included a 220 hectare farm near South Lansing, New York and a 60 hectare farm near Port Murray, New Jersey.
In February 2009, the society paid $11.5 million for 100 hectares of land in Ramapo, Rockland County, New York for an administration and residential complex. The site was reported to be planned as a base for about 850 Watch Tower workers, creating a compound combining residential and publishing facilities currently located in Brooklyn. A Witness spokesman said the land was currently zoned for residential uses, but an application would be made to rezone it, adding that "Construction is several years in the future."
A year later, the Society announced it planned to move its world headquarters from Brooklyn to a proposed eight-building complex, replacing the pre-existing four-building complex on a 100-hectare Watch Tower property in Warwick, New York, 1.5 km from its Ramapo site. A Watch Tower presentation to Warwick planning authorities said the complex would house up to 850 people. In July 2012, the Warwick planning commission approved the environmental impact statement for building the Warwick site. In July 2013, Warwick approved building plans of the multiple building complex of the new headquarters, including four residence buildings of 588 rooms for about 1,000 people. In August 2011, a 50-acre property was bought in Tuxedo, NY, with 184,000 square foot building, for $3.2 million, six miles from the Warwick site to facilitate the staging of machinery and building materials. The Society bought a 48-unit apartment building in Suffern, NY near Warwick, NY for housing temporary construction workers in June 2013.
Brooklyn property sales.
In 2004 the society began transferring its printing operations to its Wallkill factory complex. The move triggered the sale of a number of Brooklyn factory and residential properties including:
In 2011 the Watch Tower Society was reported to still own 34 properties in Brooklyn; a 2009 report calculated "a dozen or more" properties in the Brooklyn area. In a 2010 news report the Watch Tower Society said it was "not actively promoting" the sale of eight Brooklyn properties still on the market. Watch Tower Society's remaining sixteen occupied Brooklyn properties are 25, 30, 50, 58, 97, 107, 119, and 124 Columbia Heights; 55 and 67 Furman Street; 80 and 86 Willow Street; 21 Clark Street; parking lots at 1 York Street and 85 Jay Street; and 90 Sands Street already arranged to sell in 2017. The Furman Street properties and parking lots are for sale currently as stated above.
Other countries.
In 1900, the Watch Tower Society opened its first overseas branch office in Britain. Germany followed in 1903 and Australia in 1904. By 1979 the society had 39 printing branches throughout the world, with facilities transferred to farming properties in many countries including Brazil, Sweden, Denmark, Canada and Australia. In 2011, the Watch Tower Society had 98 branch offices worldwide reporting to New York directly; other nations' offices report to large branches nearby.
Directors.
Former.
Directors are listed generally from most to least recent. List may not be complete.
Criticism.
Critics including Raymond Franz, Edmond C. Gruss and James Penton have accused the society of being authoritarian, controlling and coercive in its dealings with Witnesses. Franz, a former Governing Body member, has claimed the Watch Tower Society's emphasis of the term "theocratic organization" to describe the authority structure of Jehovah's Witnesses, which places God at the apex of its organization, is designed to exercise control over every aspect of the lives of Jehovah's Witnesses and condition them to think it is wrong for them to question anything the society publishes as truth. The Watch Tower Society has been accused of employing techniques of mind control on Witnesses including the direction to avoid reading criticism of the organization, frequent and tightly controlled "indoctrination" meetings, regimentation, social alienation and elaborate promises of future rewards. Apart from life stories, the authors of all Watch Tower Society magazine articles and other publications are anonymous and correspondence from the society does not typically indicate a specific author or personal signature.

Mountcharles

Mountcharles () is a village in County Donegal, Ireland. It lies 6 km from Donegal town on the Killybegs road.
Name and history.
The area was originally known as "Tamhnach an tSalainn" (meaning "The salt mountain field"). This refers to a salt mine in the area which local people worked in, and at an growing rate, as the salt extraction rate was increased by the incoming family of Charles Conyngham. The name was later anglicized as "Tawnaghtallan" and "Tawnytallan".
The English name for the village owes its origin to the Scottish plantation runner, Charles Conyngham, who arrived in Donegal during the Plantation of Ulster and asserted a landlord control over the area, renaming the region "Mount Charles" after himself. He is the ancestor of the current "Lord" Henry Conyngham (frequently, if inaccurately, known as 'Lord Henry Mountcharles') of Slane Castle, County Meath. Charles Conyngham financed the building of the village in the 17th century. The Conyngham estate and its large estate house (Hall Demesne), close to the village, are now unoccupied. The courtesy title of the heir apparent of The Marquess Conyngham is "Earl of Mount Charles", being named after the village.
The villages's English language name is usually pronounced locally as "Mount-charr-liss".
Transport.
Mountcharles railway station opened on 18 August 1893 and shut on 1 January 1960.
Shops and pubs.
Mountcharles has two shops: one on the Main Street the other on the Upper Main Street. There are three pubs: two on the Main Street, while the other is on Upper Main Street. "The Village Tavern" on the Main Street has been voted pub and restaurant of the year in 2003 and 2004.
Sport.
Montcharles has a Gaelic games pitch that belongs to the local club St Naul's (or "Naomh Naile" in the Irish language); nearby is Eany Celtic F.C.

Weber River

The Weber River is a "c". long river of northern Utah, USA. It begins in the northwest of the Uinta Mountains and empties into the Great Salt Lake. The Weber River was named for American fur trapper John Henry Weber.
The Weber River rises in the northwest of the Uinta Mountains, at the foot of peaks including Bald Mountain, Notch Mountain, and Mount Watson. It passes by Oakley, and fills the reservoir of Rockport Lake, then turns north, receiving the flow of major tributaries Silver Creek and at Coalville, Chalk Creek. Coalville is also at the upper end of Echo Reservoir; Below the reservoir, the river passes Henefer, turns more westerly, and then passes Morgan, where it receives East Canyon Creek. Issuing out of the mountains at Uintah at the mouth of Weber Canyon, it turns north again where it is joined by the Ogden River west of Ogden. The combined stream meanders across mostly-flat land, entering mud flats near where it empties into the Great Salt Lake, contributing about 25 percent of the total water entering the lake.
Among the fish to be found in the river are brook, brown, Bonneville cutthroat and stocked rainbow trout, and mountain whitefish.
The Weber has long been used for irrigation and is part of the United States Bureau of Reclamation's Weber basin project. Among the dams on the Weber are Wanship Dam on Rockport Reservoir (completed 1957) and Echo Dam (completed 1931). The watershed totals about .

Empire of the Ants (film)

Empire of the Ants is a 1977 science fiction horror film co-scripted and directed by Bert I. Gordon. Based very loosely on the short story "Empire of the Ants" by H.G. Wells, the film involves a group of prospective land buyers led by a land developer, pitted against giant, mutated ants.
It is the third and last film released in A.I.P.'s H.G. Wells film cycle, which include "The Food of the Gods" and "The Island of Dr. Moreau".
Plot.
A heavenly paradise becomes a hellish nightmare when a toxic spill turns harmless ants into gigantic rampaging monster insects. 
The opening narration briefly introduces the viewer to the ant and its behavior. It takes note how ants use pheromones to communicate, and how they cause an obligatory response that must be obeyed. "But humans don't have to worry about that..." As the opening credits roll, barrels of radioactive waste are being dumped off a boat into the ocean. Eventually one of the barrels washes up on the shore and begins to leak a silvery goo attractive to local ants. 
Meanwhile, shady land developer Marilyn Fryser (Joan Collins) takes a bunch of new clients to view some 'beach-front property' on a nearby island. In reality the land is worthless, but the trip is cut short by the group stumbling upon the lair of gigantic ants. The ants destroy their boat and chase the group through the woods. Fleeing for their lives through the wilderness and losing many of their party along the way, the remaining survivors eventually discover the local island town. But their safety is short-lived when they realize that not only are the giant ants feeding on the local sugar factory, but at the behest of the humans. The queen ant, using pheromones has the entire town completely under control, and the giant ants are determined to exterminate humankind and build an evil empire. However, the survivors manage to escape and burn the sugar factory, killing the giant ants, and leave the island by a speedboat.
Special effects.
As with most Bert I. Gordon films, the giant ants are rendered by way of photographically enlarged animal footage and rear projection. The size of the ants varies from scene to scene. They often appear to suddenly crawl off the ground and walk vertically upwards in thin air. This is due to real ants being placed in a set lined with photographs of the locations where the scenes were shot. When an ant walked onto the rear photograph it appeared to walk on the sky. Where the film calls for actors to interact with the ants, large mock-up props are used. On the props, Joan Collins later said she did not like working with the ant props as they bumped and scratched the actors, including herself. She even took small bleeding marks to her legs from the props, but she recovered later.

Bereshit (parsha)

Bereshit, Bereishit, Bereishis, B'reshith, Beresheet, or Bereishees ( — Hebrew for "in beginning,” the first word in the parashah) is the first weekly Torah portion (, "parashah") in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading. The parashah consists of The parashah is made up of 7,235 Hebrew letters, 1,931 Hebrew words, and 146 verses, and can occupy about 241 lines in a Torah Scroll (, "Sefer Torah").
Jews read it on the first Sabbath after Simchat Torah, generally in October. Jews also read the beginning part of the parashah, as the second Torah reading for Simchat Torah, after reading the last parts of the book of Deuteronomy, Parashah V'Zot HaBerachah, 
In the parashah, God creates the world, and Adam and Eve. They commit the first sin, and God expels them from the Garden of Eden. One of their sons, Cain, becomes the first murderer, killing his brother Abel out of jealousy. Adam and Eve have other children, whose descendants populate the Earth, but each generation becomes more and more degenerate until God, despairing, decides to destroy humanity. Only one man, Noah, finds favor in the eyes of God.
Readings.
In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , "aliyot". In the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Parashah Bereishit has ten "open portion" (, "petuchah") divisions (roughly equivalent to paragraphs, often abbreviated with the Hebrew letter ("peh")). Parashah Bereishit has several further subdivisions, called "closed portion" (, "setumah") divisions (abbreviated with the Hebrew letter ("samekh")) within the open portion (, "petuchah") divisions. The first seven open portion (, "petuchah") divisions set apart the accounts of the first seven days in the first reading (, "aliyah"). The eighth open portion (, "petuchah"), spans the second and third readings (, "aliyot"). The ninth open portion (, "petuchah") contains the fourth, fifth, sixth, and part of the seventh readings (, "aliyot"). The tenth open portion (, "petuchah") is identical with the concluding maftir () reading. Closed portion (, "setumah") divisions further divide the third, fourth, sixth, and seventh readings (, "aliyot"). 
First reading.
In the first reading (, "aliyah"), God (Elohim) created the heaven and earth "in the beginning", the earth was unformed and void, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved on the face of the water. (, ) God spoke and created in six days: 
Second reading.
In the second reading (, "aliyah"), before any shrub or grass had yet sprouted on earth, and before God (Original text:יהוה transliterated as YHWH. One of many translated names and titles of God) had sent rain for the earth, a flow would well up from the ground to water the earth. God formed man from the dust, blew the breath of life into his nostrils, and made him a living being. God planted a garden in the east in Eden, caused to grow there every good and pleasing tree, and placed the tree of life and the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the middle of the garden. A river issued from Eden to water the garden, and then divided into four branches: the Pishon, which winds through Havilah, where the gold is; the Gihon, which winds through Cush; the Tigris, which flows east of Asshur; and the Euphrates. God placed the man in the garden of Eden to till and tend it, and freed him to eat from every tree of the garden, except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, warning that if the man ate of it, he would surely die. Announcing that it was not good for man to be alone and that God would make for him a fitting helper, God formed out of the earth all the beasts and birds and brought them to the man to name. The second reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Third reading.
In the third reading (, "aliyah"), the man Adam named all the animals, but found no fitting helper. So God cast a deep sleep upon the man and took one of his ribs and fashioned it into a woman and brought her to the man. The man declared her bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, and called her woman. Thus a man leaves his parents and clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh. The man and the woman were naked, but felt no shame. The serpent (, "nachash"), the shrewdest of the beasts, asked the woman whether God had really forbidden her to eat any of the fruit in the garden. The woman replied that they could eat any fruit other than that of the tree in the middle of the garden, which God had warned them neither to eat nor to touch, on pain of death.
The serpent told the woman that she would not die, but that as soon as she ate the fruit, her eyes would be opened and she would be like divine beings who knew good and evil. When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, pleasing in appearance, and desirable as a source of wisdom, she ate some of its fruit and gave some to her husband to eat. Then their eyes were opened and they saw that they were naked; and they sewed themselves loincloths out of fig leaves. Hearing God move in the garden, they hid in the trees. God asked the man where he was. The man replied that he grew afraid when he heard God, and he hid because he was naked. God asked him who told him that he was naked and whether he had eaten the forbidden fruit. The man replied that the woman whom God put at his side gave him the fruit, and he ate. When God asked the woman what she had done, she replied that the serpent duped her, and she ate. God cursed the serpent to crawl on its belly, to eat dirt, and to live in enmity with the woman and her offspring. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here.
In the continuation of the reading, God cursed the woman to bear children in pain, to desire her husband, and to be ruled by him. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here.
In the continuation of the reading, God cursed Adam to toil to earn his food from the ground, which would sprout thorns and thistles, until he returned to the ground from which he was taken. Adam named his wife Eve, because she was the mother to all. And God made skin garments to clothe Adam and Eve. The third reading (, "aliyah") and the eighth open portion (, "petuchah") end here.
Fourth reading.
In the fourth reading (, "aliyah"), remarking that the man had become like God, knowing good and bad, God became concerned that he should also eat from the tree of life and live forever, so God banished him from the garden of Eden, to till the soil. God drove the man out, and stationed cherubim and a fiery ever-turning sword east of the garden to guard the tree of life. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here with the end of chapter 
In the continuation of the reading in chapter Eve bore Cain and Abel, who became a farmer and a shepherd respectively. Cain brought God an offering from the fruit of the soil, and Abel brought the choicest of the firstlings of his flock. God paid heed to Abel and his offering, but not to Cain and his, distressing Cain. God asked Cain why he was distressed, because he had free will, and if he acted righteously, he would be happy, but if he didn't, sin crouched at the door.
Cain spoke to Abel, and when they were in the field, Cain killed Abel. When God asked Cain where his brother was, Cain replied that he did not know, asking if he was his brother's keeper. God asked Cain what he had done, as his brother's blood cried out to God from the ground. God cursed Cain to fail at farming and to become a ceaseless wanderer. Cain complained to God that his punishment was too great to bear, as anyone who met him might kill him. So God put a mark on Cain and promised to take sevenfold vengeance on anyone who would kill him. Cain left God's presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden. Cain had a son, Enoch, and founded a city, and named it after Enoch. Enoch had a son Irad; and Irad had a son Mehujael; and Mehujael had a son Methushael; and Methushael had a son Lamech. The fourth reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Fifth reading.
In the short fifth reading (, "aliyah"), Lamech took two wives: Adah and Zillah. Adah bore Jabal, the ancestor of those who dwell in tents and amidst herds, and Jubal, the ancestor of all who play the lyre and the pipe. And Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who forged implements of copper and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah. The fifth reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Sixth reading.
In the sixth reading (, "aliyah"), Lamech told his wives that he had slain a lad for bruising him, and that if Cain was avenged sevenfold, then Lamech should be avenged seventy-sevenfold. Adam and Eve had a third son and named him Seth, meaning "God has provided me with another offspring in place of Abel." Seth had a son named Enosh, and then men began to invoke the Lord by name. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here with the end of chapter 
In the continuation of the reading in chapter after the birth of Seth, Adam had more sons and daughters, and lived a total of 930 years before he died. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here.
In the continuation of the reading, Adam's descendants and their lifespans were: Seth, 912 years; Enosh, 905 years; Kenan, 910 years; Mahalalel, 895 years; and Jared, 962 years. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends after the account of each descendant.
In the continuation of the reading, Jared's son Enoch had a son Methuselah and then walked with God 300 years, and when Enoch reached age 365, God took him. The sixth reading (, "aliyah") and a closed portion (, "setumah") end here.
Seventh reading.
In the seventh reading (, "aliyah"), Methuselah had a son Lamech and lived 969 years. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here.
In the continuation of the reading, Lamech had a son Noah, saying that Noah would provide relief from their work and toil on the soil that God had cursed. Lamech lived 777 years. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here.
In the continuation of the reading, when Noah had lived 500 years, he had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. God set the days allowed to man at 120 years. Divine beings admired and took wives from among the daughters of men, who bore the Nephilim, heroes of old, men of renown. The ninth open portion (, "petuchah") ends here.
As the reading continues with the maftir () reading that concludes the parashah, God saw how great man's wickedness was and how man’s every plan was evil, and God regretted making man and became saddened. God expressed an intention to blot men and animals from the earth, but Noah found God’s favor. The seventh reading (, "aliyah"), the tenth open portion (, "petuchah"), and the parashah end here.
Key words.
Words used frequently in the parashah include: God, gods (67 times), man, men (41 times), said (37 times), Lord (the Name of God) (36 times), day, days (35 times), begot (31 times), years (30 times), live, lived, living (26 times), hundred (25 times), eat, eaten (20 times), tree, trees (20 times), call, called (17 times), name, names (17 times), Cain (16 times), made (16 times), good (15 times), ground (15 times), let (15 times), garden (13 times), light, lights (13 times), water, waters, watered (13 times), daughters (12 times), created (11 times), see, saw (11 times), woman (11 times), fruit, fruitful (10 times), Lamech (10 times), and Adam (9 times).
In ancient parallels.
The parashah has parallels in these ancient sources:
Genesis chapter 4.
The "NIV Archaeological Study Bible" notes that the word translated “crouches” (, "roveitz") in is the same as an ancient Babylonian word used to describe a demon lurking behind a door, threatening the people inside.
In early nonrabbinic interpretation.
The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these early nonrabbinic sources:
Genesis chapter 2.
The Book of Jubilees interpreted God’s warning to Adam in that “on the day that you eat of it you shall die” in the light of the words of Psalm that “a thousand years in sight are but as yesterday,” noting that Adam died 70 years short of the 1000 years that would constitute one day in the testimony of the heavens. And the Books of 4 Ezra (or 2 Esdras) and 2 Baruch interpreted to teach that because Adam transgressed God’s commandment, God decreed death to Adam and his descendents for all time.
In classical rabbinic interpretation.
The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud:
Genesis chapter 1.
Rabbi Jonah taught in the name of Rabbi Levi that the world was created with a letter "bet" (the first letter in which begins , "bereishit bara Elohim", “In the beginning God created”), because just as the letter "bet" is closed at the sides but open in front, so one is not permitted to investigate what is above and what is below, what is before and what is behind. Similarly, Bar Kappara reinterpreted the words of to say, “ask "not" of the days past, which were before you, since the day that God created man upon the earth,” teaching that one may speculate from the day that days were created, but one should not speculate on what was before that. And one may investigate from one end of heaven to the other, but one should not investigate what was before this world. Both Rabbi Johanan and Rabbi Eleazar (or other say Resh Lakish) compared this to a human king who instructed his servants to build a great palace on a dunghill. They built it for him. Thereafter, the king did not wish to hear mention of the dunghill. Similarly, the Mishnah taught that one should not teach about the Creation to more than one student.
A Midrash (rabbinic commentary) explained that six things preceded the creation of the world: the Torah and the Throne of Glory were created, the creation of the Patriarchs was contemplated, the creation of Israel was contemplated, the creation of the Temple in Jerusalem was contemplated, and the name of the Messiah was contemplated, as well as repentance.
Rav Zutra bar Tobiah said in the name of Rav that the world was created with ten things: (1) wisdom, (2) understanding, (3) reason, (4) strength, (5) rebuke, (6) might, (7) righteousness, (8) judgment, (9) loving-kindness, and (10) compassion. The Gemara cited verses to support Rav Zutra’s proposition: wisdom and understanding, as says, “The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; and by understanding established the heavens”; reason, as says, “By His reason the depths were broken up”; strength and might, as says, “Who by Your strength sets fast the mountains, Who is girded about with might”; rebuke, as says, “The pillars of heaven were trembling, but they became astonished at His rebuke”; righteousness and judgment, as says, “Righteousness and judgment are the foundation of Your throne”; and loving-kindness and compassion, as says, “Remember, O Lord, Your compassions and Your mercies; for they have been from of old.”
A Midrash taught that a heretic once asked Rabbi Akiva who created the world. Rabbi Akiva answered that God had. The heretic demanded that Rabbi Akiva give him clear proof. Rabbi Akiva asked him what he was wearing. The heretic said that it was a garment. Rabbi Akiva asked him who made it. The heretic replied that a weaver had. Rabbi Akiva demanded that the heretic give him proof. The heretic asked Rabbi Akiva whether he did not realize that a garment is made by a weaver. Rabbi Akiva replied by asking the heretic whether he did not realize that the world was made by God. When the heretic had left, Rabbi Akiva’s disciples asked him to explain his proof. Rabbi Akiva replied that just as a house implies a builder, a dress implies a weaver, and a door implies a carpemter, so the world proclaims the God who created it.
It was taught in a Baraita that King Ptolemy brought together 72 elders, placed them in 72 separate rooms without telling them why, and directed each of them to translate the Torah. God then prompted each one of them and they all conceived the same idea and wrote for “God created in the beginning” (instead of, “In the beginning, God created,” to prevent readers from reading into the text two creating powers, “In the beginning” and “God”).
Rav Assi of Hozna'ah deduced from the words, “And it came to pass in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month,” in that the Tabernacle was erected on the first of Nisan. With reference to this, a Tanna taught that the first of Nisan took ten crowns of distinction by virtue of the ten momentous events that occurred on that day. The first of Nisan was: (1) the first day of the Creation (as reported in ), (2) the first day of the princes’ offerings (as reported in ), (3) the first day for the priesthood to make the sacrificial offerings (as reported in ), (4) the first day for public sacrifice, (5) the first day for the descent of fire from Heaven (as reported in ), (6) the first for the priests’ eating of sacred food in the sacred area, (7) the first for the dwelling of the Shechinah in Israel (as implied by ), (8) the first for the Priestly Blessing of Israel (as reported in employing the blessing prescribed by ), (9) the first for the prohibition of the high places (as stated in ), and (10) the first of the months of the year (as instructed in ).
Similarly, a Baraita compared the day that God created the universe with the day that the Israelites dedicated the Tabernacle. Reading the words of “And it came to pass on the eighth day,” a Baraita taught that on that day (when the Israelites dedicated the Tabernacle) there was joy before God as on the day when God created heaven and earth. For says, “And it came to pass (, "va-yehi") on the eighth day,” and says, “And there was (, "va-yehi") one day.”
The Mishnah taught that God created the world with ten Divine utterances. Noting that surely God could have created the world with one utterance, the Mishnah asks what we are meant to learn from this, replying, if God had created the world by a single utterance, men would think less of the world, and have less compunction about undoing God’s creation.
Rabbi Johanan taught that the ten utterances with which God created the world account for the rule taught in a Baraita cited by Rabbi Shimi that no fewer than ten verses of the Torah should be read in the synagogue. The ten verses represent God’s ten utterances. The Gemara explained that the ten utterances are indicated by the ten uses of “And said” in To the objection that these words appear only nine times in the Gemara responded that the words “In the beginning” also count as a creative utterance. For says, “By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth” (and thus one may learn that the heavens and earth were created by Divine utterance before the action of takes place). 
Rav Judah said in Rav’s name that ten things were created on the first day: (1) heaven, (2) earth, (3) chaos (, "tohu"), (4) desolation or void (, "bohu"), (5) light, (6) darkness, (7) wind, (8) water, (9) the length of a day, and (10) the length of a night. The Gemara cited verses to support Rav Judah’s proposition: heaven and earth, as says, “In the beginning God created heaven and earth”; "tohu" and "bohu", as says, “and the earth was "tohu" and "bohu"”; darkness, as says, “and darkness was upon the face of the deep; light, as says, “And God said, ‘Let there be light’”; wind and water, as says, “and the wind of God hovered over the face of the waters”; and the length of a day and the length of a night, as says, “And there was evening and there was morning, one day.” A Baraita taught that "tohu" (chaos) is a green line that encompasses the world, out of which darkness proceeds, as says, “He made darkness His hiding-place round about Him”; and "bohu" (desolation) means the slimy stones in the deep out of which the waters proceed, as says, “He shall stretch over it the line of confusion ("tohu") and the plummet of emptiness ("bohu").” The Gemara questioned Rav Judah’s assertion that light was created on the first day, as reports that “God made the two great lights . . . and God set them in the firmament of the heaven,” and reports that God did so on the fourth day. The Gemara explained that the light of which Rav Judah taught was the light of which Rabbi Eleazar spoke when he said that by the light that God created on the first day, one could see from one end of the world to the other; but as soon as God saw the corrupt generations of the Flood and the Dispersion, God hid the light from them, as says, “But from the wicked their light is withheld.” Rather, God reserved the light of the first day for the righteous in the time to come, as says, “And God saw the light, that it was good.” The Gemara noted a dispute among the Tannaim over this interpretation. Rabbi Jacob agreed with the view that by the light that God created on the first day one could see from one end of the world to the other. But the Sages equated the light created on the first day with the lights of which speaks, which God created on the first day, but placed in the heavens on the fourth day.
Rav Judah taught that when God created the world, it went on expanding like two unraveling balls of thread, until God rebuked it and brought it to a standstill, as says, "The pillars of heaven were trembling, but they became astonished at His rebuke." Similarly, Resh Lakish taught that the words "I am God Almighty" (, "El Shaddai") in mean, "I am He Who said to the world: ‘Enough!’" (, "Dai"). Resh Lakish taught that when God created the sea, it went on expanding, until God rebuked it and caused it to dry up, as says, "He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers."
The Rabbis reported in a Baraita that the House of Shammai taught that heaven was created first and the earth was created afterwards, as says, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” But the House of Hillel taught that the earth was created first and heaven was created afterwards, as says, “In the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven.” The House of Hillel faulted the House of Shammai for believing that one can build a house’s upper stories and afterwards builds the house, as calls heaven God’s “upper chambers,” saying, “It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heaven, and has founded His vault upon the earth.” The House of Shammai, in turn, faulted the House of Hillel for believing that a person builds a footstool first, and afterwards builds the throne, as calls heaven God’s throne and the earth God’s footstool. But the Sages said that God created both heaven and earth at the same time, as says, “My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens: When I call to them, they stand up together.” The House of Shammai and the House of Hillel, however, interpreted the word “together” in to mean only that heaven and earth cannot be separated from each another. Resh Lakish reconciled the differing verses by positing that God created heaven first, and afterwards created the earth; but when God put them in place, God put the earth in place first, and afterwards put heaven in place.
Rabbi Jose bar Hanina taught that “heaven” (, "shamayim") means “there is water” ("sham mayim"). A Baraita taught that it means “fire and water” ("eish u’mayim"), teaching that God brought fire and water together and mixed them to make the firmament.
Interpreting the words “God called the light (, "or") day” in the Gemara hypothesized that "or" () might thus be read to mean "daytime." The Gemara further hypothesized from its use in that "or" () might be read to mean the time when light begins to appear — that is, daybreak. If so, then one would need to interpret the continuation of "and the darkness He called night," to teach that "night" (, "lailah") similarly must mean the advancing of darkness. But it is established (in Babylonian Talmud Berakhot 2b) that day continues until stars appear. The Gemara therefore concluded that when “God called the light" in God summoned the light and appointed it for duty by day, and similarly God summoned the darkness and appointed it for duty by night.
The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was standing on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma what was up. Ben Zoma replied that he was staring at the space between the upper and the lower waters (described in ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers’ space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that says, “And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters,” implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that says that “the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water” on the "first" day of Creation, but God divided the waters on the "second" day, as reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other.
Rabbi Judah ben Pazi noted that a similar word appears in both — where , "rakiya" is translated as “firmament” — and — where , "vayraku" is translated as “and they flattened.” He thus deduced from the usage in that taught that on the second day of creation, God spread the heavens flat like a cloth. Or Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon deduced from that meant “let a lining be made for the firmament.”
A Baraita taught that the upper waters created in remain suspended by Divine command, and their fruit is the rainwater, and thus says: "The earth is full of the fruit of Your works." This view accords with that of Rabbi Joshua. Rabbi Eliezer, however, interpreted to refer to other handiwork of God.
Rabbi Eliezer taught that on the day that God said in “Let the waters be gathered together,” God laid the foundation for the miracle of the splitting of the sea in the Exodus from Egypt. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer recounted that in the Exodus, Moses cried out to God that the enemy was behind them and the sea in front of them, and asked which way they should go. So God sent the angel Michael, who became a wall of fire between the Israelites and the Egyptians. The Egyptians wanted to follow after the Israelites, but they are unable to come near because of the fire. The angels saw the Israelites’ misfortune all the night, but they uttered neither praise nor sanctification, as says, “And the one came not near the other all the night.” God told Moses (as reports) to “Stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it.” So (as reports) “Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,” but the sea refused to be divided. So God looked at the sea, and the waters saw God’s Face, and they trembled and quaked, and descended into the depths, as says, “The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You, they were afraid: the depths also trembled.” Rabbi Eliezer taught that on the day that God said in “Let the waters be gathered together,” the waters congealed, and God made them into twelve valleys, corresponding to the twelve tribes, and they were made into walls of water between each path, and the Israelites could see each other, and they saw God, walking before them, but they did not see the heels of God’s feet, as says, “Your way was in the sea, and Your paths in the great waters, and Your footsteps were not known.”
Rabbi Johanan taught that the words “and God created the great sea-monsters” in referred to Leviathan the slant serpent and Leviathan the tortuous serpent, also referred to in Rav Judah taught in the name of Rav that God created all living things in this world male and female, including Leviathan the slant serpent and Leviathan the tortuous serpent. Had they mated with one another, they would have destroyed the world, so God castrated the male and killed the female, preserving it in salt for the righteous in the world to come, as reported in when it says: “And he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.” Similarly, God also created male and female the “Behemoth upon a thousand hills” referred to in Had they mated, they also would have destroyed the world, so God castrated the male and cooled the female and preserved it for the righteous for the world to come. Rav Judah taught further in the name of Rav that when God wanted to create the world, God told the angel of the sea to open the angel’s mouth and swallow all the waters of the world. When the angel protested, God struck the angel dead, as reported in when it says: “He stirs up the sea with his power and by his understanding he smites through Rahab.” Rabbi Isaac deduced from this that the name of the angel of the sea was Rahab, and had the waters not covered Rahab, no creature could have stood the smell.
Rabbi Johanan explained that uses the plural pronoun when God says, “Let us make man,” to teach that God does nothing without consulting God’s Heavenly Court of angels (thus instructing us in the proper conduct of humility among subordinates).
Noting that uses the plural pronoun when God says, “Let us make man,” the heretics asked Rabbi Simlai how many deities created the world. Rabbi Simlai replied that wherever one finds a point apparently supporting the heretics, one finds the refutation nearby in the text. Thus says, “Let us make man” (using the plural pronoun), but then says, “And God created” (using the singular pronoun). When the heretics had departed, Rabbi Simlai’s disciples told him that they thought that he had dismissed the heretics with a mere makeshift, and asked him for the real answer. Rabbi Simlai then told his disciples that in the first instance, God created Adam from dust and Eve from Adam, but thereafter God would create humans (in the words of ) “in Our image, after Our likeness,” neither man without woman nor woman without man, and neither of them without the "Shechinah" (the indwelling nurturing presence of God, designated with a feminine noun).
It was taught in a Baraita that when King Ptolemy brought together 72 elders, placed them in 72 separate rooms without telling them why, and directed each of them to translate the Torah, God prompted each one of them and they all conceived the same idea and wrote for “"I" shall make man in image and likeness” (instead of “Let "us" make,” to prevent readers from reading into the text multiple creating powers).
Rabbi Eleazar read the words "since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven" in to read, "from the day that God created Adam on earth and to the end of heaven." Thus Rabbi Eleazar read to intimate that when God created Adam in Adam extended from the earth to the sky. But as soon as Adam sinned, God placed God's hand upon Adam and diminished him, as says: "You have fashioned me after and before, and laid Your hand upon me." Similarly, Rav Judah in the name of Rav taught that when God created Adam in Adam extended from one end of the world to the other, reading to read, "Since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from one end of heaven to the other." (And Rav Judah in the name of Rav also taught that as soon as Adam sinned, God placed God's hand upon Adam and diminished him.) The Gemara reconciled the interpretations of Rabbi Eleazar and Rav Judah in the name of Rav by concluding that the distance from the earth to the sky must equal the distance from one end of heaven to the other.
The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that for two and a half years the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel debated, the House of Shammai asserting that it would have been better for humanity not to have been created, and the House of Hillel maintaining that it is better that humanity was created. They finally took a vote and decided that it would have been better for humanity not to have been created, but now that humanity has been created, let us investigate our past deeds or, as others say, let us examine our future actions.
The Mishnah taught that in Second Temple times, Jews would acknowledge God’s creation and read the verses of the creation story when representatives of the people would assemble (as what were called "ma’amadot") to participate in sacrifices made in Jerusalem on their behalf. The people of the delegation would fast four days during the week that they assembled. On the first day (Sunday), they would read On the second day, they would read On the third day, they would read On the fourth day, they would read On the fifth day, they would read And on the sixth day, they would read Rabbi Ammi taught that if had not been for the worship of these delegations, heaven and earth would not be firmly established, reading to say, “If it were not for My covenant day and night, I would not have established the statutes of heaven and earth.” And Rabbi Ammi cited to show that when Abraham asked God how Abraham would know that his descendants would inherit the Land notwithstanding their sins, God replied by calling on Abraham to sacrifice several animals. Rabbi Ammi then reported that Abraham asked God what would happen in times to come when there would be no Temple at which to offer sacrifices. Rabbi Ammi reported that God replied to Abraham that whenever Abraham’s descendents will read the sections of the Torah dealing with the sacrifices, God will account it as if they had brought the offerings, and forgive all their sins.
It was recorded in Rabbi Joshua ben Levi's notebook that a person born on the first day of the week (Sunday) will lack one thing. The Gemara explained that the person will be either completely virtuous or completely wicked, because on that day (in ) God created the extremes of light and darkness. A person born on the second day of the week (Monday) will be bad-tempered, because on that day (in ) God divided the waters (and similarly division will exist between this person and others). A person born on the third day of the week (Tuesday) will be wealthy and promiscuous, because on that day (in ) God created fast-growing herbs. A person born on the fourth day of the week (Wednesday) will be bright, because on that day (in ) God set the luminaries in the sky. A person born on the fifth day of the week (Thursday) will practice kindness, because on that day (in ) God created the fish and birds (who find their sustenance through God's kindness). A person born on the eve of the Sabbath (Friday) will be a seeker. Rav Nahman bar Isaac explained: a seeker after good deeds. A person born on the Sabbath (Saturday) will die on the Sabbath, because they had to desecrate the great day of the Sabbath on that person's account to attend to the birth. And Rava son of Rav Shila observed that this person shall be called a great and holy person.
Genesis chapter 2.
Rava (or some say Rabbi Joshua ben Levi) taught that even a person who prays on the eve of the Sabbath must recite “And the heaven and the earth were finished . . .” (, "va-yachulu hashamayim v’haaretz . . ."), for Rav Hamnuna taught that whoever prays on the eve of the Sabbath and recites “and the heaven and the earth were finished,” the Writ treats as though a partner with God in the Creation, for one may read "va-yachulu" () — “and they were finished” — as "va-yekallu" — “and they finished.” Rabbi Eleazar taught that we know that speech is like action because says, “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made.” Rav Hisda said in Mar Ukba's name that when one prays on the eve of the Sabbath and recites “and the heaven and the earth were finished,” two ministering angels place their hands on the head of the person praying and say (in the words of ), “Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.”
It was taught in a Baraita that when King Ptolemy brought together 72 elders, placed them in 72 separate rooms without telling them why, and directed each of them to translate the Torah, God prompted each one of them and they all conceived the same idea and wrote for “And he finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh day” (instead of “and He finished on the seventh day,” to prevent readers from reading that God worked on the Sabbath).
Similarly, Rabbi asked Rabbi Ishmael the son of Rabbi Jose if he had learned from his father the actual meaning of “And on the seventh day God finished the work that He had been doing” (for surely God finished God’s work on the sixth day, not the Sabbath). He compared it to a man striking a hammer on an anvil, raising it by day and bringing it down immediately after nightfall. (In the second between raising the hammer and bringing it down, night began. Thus, he taught that God finished God’s work right at the end of the sixth day, so that in that very moment the Sabbath began.) Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that mortal humans, who do not know exactly what time it is, must add from the profane to the sacred to avoid working in the sacred time; but God knows time precisely, can enter the Sabbath by a hair’s breadth. Genibah and the Rabbis discussed Genibah compared it to a king who made a bridal chamber, which he plastered, painted, and adorned, so that all that the bridal chamber lacked was a bride to enter it. Similarly, just then, the world lacked the Sabbath. (Thus by means of instituting the Sabbath itself, God completed God’s work, and humanity’s world, on the seventh day.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who made a ring that lacked only a signet. Similarly, the world lacked the Sabbath. And the Midrash taught that this is one of the texts that they changed for King Ptolemy (as they could not expect him to understand these explanations), making read, “And He finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh.” King Ptolemy (or others say, a philosopher) asked the elders in Rome how many days it took God to create the world. The elders replied that it took God six days. He replied that since then, Gehenna has been burning for the wicked. Reading the words “His work” in Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon that with neither labor nor toil did God create the world, yet says, “He rested . . . from all His work.” He explained that states it that way to punish the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with labor, and to give a good reward to the righteous who uphold the world, which was created with toil. Reading the words “Because that in it He rested from all His work which God created to make,” in the Midrash taught that what was created on the Sabbath, after God rested, was tranquility, ease, peace, and quiet. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Nehorai that as long as the hands of their Master were working on them, they went on expanding; but when the hands of their Master rested, rest was afforded to them, and thus God gave rest to the world on the seventh day. Rabbi Abba taught that when a mortal king takes his army to their quarters, he does not distribute largesse (rather, he does that only before the troops go into battle), and when he distributes largesse, he does not order a halt. But God ordered a halt and distributed largesse, as says, “And He rested . . . and He blessed.” (Not only did God afford humanity a day of rest, but God also gave humanity the gift of a sacred day.)
Reading “And on the seventh day God finished his work,” the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that God created seven dedications (for the creation of each of the seven days). God expressed six of them, and reserved one for future generations. Thus, when God created the first day and finished all God’s work on it, God dedicated it, as says, “And it was evening, and it was morning, one day.” When God created the second day and finished all God’s work in it, God dedicated it, as says, “And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day.” Similar language appears through the six days of creation. God created the seventh day, but not for work, because Genesis does not say in connection the seventh day, “And it was evening and it was morning.” That is because God reserved the dedication of the seventh day for the generations to come, as says, speaking of the Sabbath, “And there shall be one day which is known to the Lord; not day, and not night.” The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer compared this to a man who had precious utensils that he did not want to leave as an inheritance to anyone but to his son. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that it is likewise with God. God did not want to give the day of blessing and holiness that was before God as an inheritance to anyone but Israel. For when the Israelites left Egypt, before God gave them the Torah, God gave them the Sabbath as an inheritance (as reported in ). Before God gave Israel the Torah, they kept two Sabbaths, as says first, “And You made known to them Your holy Sabbath.” And only afterwards did God give them the Torah, as says as it continues, “And commanded them commandments, and statutes, and Torah by the hand of Moses, Your servant.” God observed and sanctified the Sabbath, and Israel is obliged only to observe and sanctify the Sabbath. For when God gave the Israelites manna, all theough the 40 years in the wilderness, God gave it during on the six days during which God had created the world, Sunday through Friday, but on the Sabbath, God did not give them manna. Of course, God had power enough to give them manna every day. But the Sabbath was before God, so God gave the Israelites bread for two days on Friday, as says, “See, for the Lord has given you the Sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days.” When the people saw that God observed the Sabbath, they also rested, as says, “So the people rested on the seventh day.” Reading “And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it,” the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that God "blessed" and hallowed the Sabbath day, and Israel is bound only to "keep" and to hallow the Sabbath day. Hence the Sages said that those who says the benediction and sanctification over the wine on Friday evenings will have their days increased in this world, and in the world to come. For says, “For by me your days shall be multiplied,” singinfying in this world. And continues, “and the years of your life shall be increased,” signifying in the world to come.
Rabbi Simeon noted that nearly everywhere, Scripture gives precedence to the creation of heaven over earth. But says, “the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven” (listing earth before heaven). Rabbi Simeon concluded that thus teaches that the earth is equivalent to heaven.
The Tosefta taught that the generation of the Flood acted arrogantly before God on account of the good that God lavished on them, in part in So (in the words of ) “they said to God: ‘Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of Your ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?’” They scoffed that they needed God for only a few drops of rain, and they deluded themselves that they had rivers and wells that were more than enough for them, and as reports, “there rose up a mist from the earth.” God noted that they took excess pride based upon the goodness that God lavished on them, so God replied that with that same goodness God would punish them. And thus reports, “And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth.”
The Mishnah taught that God created humanity from one person in to teach that Providence considers one who destroys a single person as one who has destroyed an entire world, and Providence considers one who saves a single person as one who has saved an entire world. And God created humanity from one person for the sake of peace, so that none can say that their ancestry is greater than another’s. And God created humanity from one person so that heretics cannot say that there are many gods who created several human souls. And God created humanity from one person to demonstrate God’s greatness, for people stamp out many coins with one coin press and they all look alike, but God stamped each person with the seal of Adam, and not one of them is like another. Therefore, every person is obliged to say, “For my sake the world was created.”
It was taught in a Baraita that Rabbi Meir used to say that the dust of the first man (from which reports God made Adam) was gathered from all parts of the earth, for says of God, “Your eyes did see my unformed substance,” and says, “The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth.”
Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda expounded on the words, “Then the Lord God formed (, "wa-yitzer") man,” in Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda taught that the word וַיִּיצֶר, "wa-yitzer" is written with two "yuds" () to show that God created people with two inclinations ("yetzerim"), one good and one evil. Rav Nahman bar Isaac demurred, arguing that according to this logic, animals, of which writes , "wa-yitzer" with a single "yud", should have no evil inclination ("yetzer hara"), but we see that they injure, bite, and kick, plainly evincing an evil inclination. Rather, Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi explained that the two "yuds" by saying, “Woe is me because of my Creator ("yotzri"), woe is me because of my evil inclination ("yitzri")!” Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi thus indicated that the two "yuds" indicate the human condition, where God punishes us for giving in to our evil inclination, but our evil inclination tempts us when we try to resist. Alternatively, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar explained that the two "yuds" reflect that God created two countenances in the first man, one man and one woman, back to back, as says, “Behind and before have You formed me.”
Similarly, a Midrash recounts that Rabbi Jeremiah ben Leazar taught that when God created Adam, God created him a hermaphrodite — two bodies, male and female, joined together — for says, “male and female created He them . . . and called their name Adam.” Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman taught that when God created Adam, God created Adam double-faced, then God split Adam and made Adam of two backs, one back on this side and one back on the other side. An objection was raised that says, “And He took one of his ribs” (implying that God created Eve separately from Adam). Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman replied that the word read as “rib” — , "mi-zalotav" — actually means one of Adam’s sides, just as one reads in “And for the second side (, "zela") of the tabernacle.”
Reading God’s observation in that “it is not good that the man should be alone,” a Midrash taught that a man without a wife dwells without good, without help, without joy, without blessing, and without atonement. Without good, as says that “it is "not good" that the man should be alone.” Without help, as in God says, “I will make him a "help" meet for him.” Without joy, as says, “And you shall rejoice, you "and your household"” (implying that one can rejoice only when there is a “household” with whom to rejoice). Without a blessing, as can be read, “To cause a blessing to rest on you "for the sake of your house"” (that is, for the sake of your wife). Without atonement, as says, “And he shall make atonement for himself, "and for his house"” (implying that one can make complete atonement only with a household). Rabbi Simeon said in the name of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi, without peace too, as 1 Samuel says, “And peace be to your house.” Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in the name of Rabbi Levi, without life too, as Ecclesiastes says, “Enjoy life with the wife whom you love.” Rabbi Hiyya ben Gomdi said, also incomplete, as says, “male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam,” that is, “man” (and thus only together are they “man”). Some say a man without a wife even impairs the Divine likeness, as says, “For in the image of God made He man,” and immediately thereafter says, “And you, be fruitful, and multiply (implying that the former is impaired if one does not fulfill the latter).
The Gemara taught that all agree that there was only one formation of humankind (not a separate creation of man and woman). Rav Judah, however, noted an apparent contradiction: says, “And God created man in His own image” (in the singular), while says, “Male and female created He them” (in the plural). Rav Judah reconciled the apparent contradiction by concluding that in the beginning God intended to create two human beings, and in the end God created only one human being.
Rav and Samuel offered different explanations of the words in “And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made He a woman.” One said that this “rib” was a face, the other that it was a tail. In support of the one who said it was a face, says, “Behind and before have You formed me.” The one who said it was a tail explained the words, “Behind and before have You formed me,” as Rabbi Ammi said, that humankind was “behind,” that is, later, in the work of creation, and “before” in punishment. The Gemara conceded that humankind was last in the work of creation, for God created humankind on the eve of the Sabbath. But if when saying that humankind was first for punishment, one means the punishment in connection with the serpent, Rabbi taught that, in conferring honor the Bible commences with the greatest, in cursing with the least important. Thus, in cursing, God began with the least, cursing first the serpent, then the people. The punishment of the Flood must therefore be meant, as says, “And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle,” starting with the people. In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a face, in the word , "wa-yitzer" is written with two "yuds". But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the word , "wa-yitzer" as Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi said, “Woe is me because of my Creator ("yotzri"), woe is me because of my evil inclination ("yitzri")!” In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a face, says, “male and female created He them.” But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the words, “male and female created He them,” as Rabbi Abbahu explained when he contrasted the words, “male and female created He them,” in with the words, “in the image of God made He man,” in Rabbi Abbahu reconciled these statements by teaching that at first God intended to create two, but in the end created only one. In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a face, says, “He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof.” But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the words, “He closed up the place with flesh instead thereof,” as Rabbi Jeremiah (or as some say Rav Zebid, or others say Rav Nahman bar Isaac) said, that these words applied only to the place where God made the cut. In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a tail, says, “God built.” But the one who said that Eve was created from a face explained the words “God built” as explained by Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia, who interpreted the words, “and the Lord built the rib,” to teach that God braided Eve's hair and brought her to Adam, for in the seacoast towns braiding ("keli'ata") is called building ("binyata"). Alternatively, Rav Hisda said (or some say it was taught in a Baraita) that the words, “and the Lord built the rib,” teach that God built Eve after the fashion of a storehouse, narrow at the top and broad at the bottom so as to hold the produce safely. So Rav Hisda taught that a woman is narrower above and broader below so as better to carry children.
The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that if an orphan applied to the community for assistance to marry, the community must rent a house, supply a bed and necessary household furnishings, and put on the wedding, as says, “sufficient for his need, whatever is lacking for him.” The Rabbis interpreted the words “sufficient for his need” to refer to the house, “whatever is lacking” to refer to a bed and a table, and “for him (, "lo")” to refer to a wife, as uses the same term, “for him (, "lo"),” to refer to Adam’s wife, whom calls “a helpmate "for him".”
Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar interpreted the words, “and he brought her to the man,” in to teach that God acted as best man to Adam, teaching that a man of eminence should not think it amiss to act as best man for a lesser man.
Interpreting the words “And the man said: ‘"This is now" bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman’” in Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi taught that the first time God created a woman for Adam, he saw her full of discharge and blood. So God removed her from Adam and recreated her a second time.
Rabbi José taught that Isaac observed three years of mourning for his mother Sarah. After three years he married Rebekah, and forgot the mourning for his mother. Hence Rabbi José taught that until a man marries a wife, his love centers on his parents. When he marries a wife, he bestows his love upon his wife, as says, “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife.”
Genesis chapter 3.
Hezekiah noted that in Eve added to God’s words by telling the serpent that she was not even permitted to touch the tree. Hezekiah deduced from this that one who adds to God’s words in fact subtracts from them.
A Midrash explained that because the serpent was the first to speak slander in God punished the Israelites by means of serpents in when they spoke slander. God cursed the serpent, but the Israelites did not learn a lesson from the serpent’s fate, and nonetheless spoke slander. God therefore sent the serpent, who was the first to introduce slander, to punish those who spoke slander.
Judah ben Padiah noted Adam’s frailty, for he could not remain loyal even for a single hour to God’s charge that he not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, yet in accordance with Adam’s descendants the Israelites waited three years for the fruits of a tree.
Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman said in Rabbi Jonathan's name that we can deduce from the story of the serpent in that one should not plead on behalf of one who instigates idolatry. For Rabbi Simlai taught that the serpent had many pleas that it could have advanced, but it did not do so. And God did not plead on the serpent’s behalf, because it offered no plea itself. The Gemara taught that the serpent could have argued that when the words of the teacher and the pupil are contradictory, one should surely obey the teacher’s (and so Eve should have obeyed God’s command).
A Baraita reported that Rabbi taught that in conferring an honor, we start with the most important person, while in conferring a curse, we start with the least important. demonstrates that in conferring an honor, we start with the most important person, for when Moses instructed Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar that they should not conduct themselves as mourners, Moses spoke first to Aaron and only thereafter to Aaron’s sons Eleazar and Ithamar. And demonstrates that in conferring a curse, we start with the least important, for God cursed the serpent first, and only thereafter cursed Eve and then Adam.
Rabbi Ammi taught that there is no death without sin, as says, “The soul that sins . . . shall die.” The Gemara reported an objection based on the following Baraita: The ministering angels asked God why God imposed the death penalty on Adam (in ). God answered that God gave Adam an easy command, and he violated it. The angels objected that Moses and Aaron fulfilled the whole Torah, but they died. God replied (in the words of ), “There is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; . . . as is the good, so is the sinner.” The Gemara concluded that the Baraita refuted Rabbi Ammi, and there is indeed death without sin and suffering without iniquity.
Rabbi Joshua ben Levi taught that when in God told Adam, “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to you,” Adam began to cry and pleaded before God that he not be forced to eat out of the same trough with his donkey. But as soon as God told Adam in “In the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread,” Adam’s mind was set at ease. Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish taught that humanity is fortunate that we did not remain subject to the first decree. Abaye (or others say Simeon ben Lakish) observed that we are still not altogether removed from the benefits of the first decree, as we eat herbs of the field (which come forth without effort).
Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina taught that demonstrates one of God’s attributes that humans should emulate. Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina asked what means in the text, “You shall walk after the Lord your God.” How can a human being walk after God, when says, “Lord your God is a devouring fire”? Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina explained that the command to walk after God means to walk after the attributes of God. As God clothes the naked — for says, “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skin, and clothed them” — so should we also clothe the naked. God visited the sick — for says, “And the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre” (after Abraham was circumcised in ) — so should we also visit the sick. God comforted mourners — for says, “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son” — so should we also comfort mourners. God buried the dead — for says, “And He buried him in the valley” — so should we also bury the dead. Similarly, the Sifre on taught that to walk in God’s ways means to be (in the words of ) “merciful and gracious.”
Genesis chapter 4.
It was taught in a Baraita that Issi ben Judah said that there are five verses in the Torah whose grammatical construction cannot be decided. (Each verse contains a phrase that a reader can link to the clause either before it or after it.) Among these five is the phrase “lifted up” (, "seit") in (One could read to mean: If you do well, good! But you must bear the sin, if you do not do well. Or one could read to mean, in the usual interpretation: If you do well, there will be forgiving, or “lifting up of face.” And if you do not do well, sin couches at the door. In the first reading, the reader attaches the term “lifted up” to the following clause. In the second reading, the reader attaches the term “lifted up” to the preceding clause.)
The Rabbis read God’s admonition to Cain in to describe the conflict that one has with one’s Evil Inclination ("yetzer hara"). The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that says of the Torah, “So you fix (, "ve-samtem") these My words in your heart and in your soul.” The Rabbis taught that one should read the word "samtem" rather as "sam tam" (meaning “a perfect remedy”). The Rabbis thus compared the Torah to a perfect remedy. The Rabbis compared this to a man who struck his son a strong blow, and then put a compress on the son’s wound, telling his son that so long as the compress was on his wound, he could eat and drink at will, and bathe in hot or cold water, without fear. But if the son removed the compress, his skin would break out in sores. Even so did God tell Israel that God created the Evil Inclination, but also created the Torah as its antidote. God told Israel that if they occupied themselves with the Torah, they would not be delivered into the hand of the Evil Inclination, as says: “If you do well, shall you not be exalted?” But if Israel did not occupy themselves with the Torah, they would be delivered into the hand of the Evil Inclination, as says: “sin couches at the door.” Moreover, the Rabbis taught, the Evil Inclination is altogether preoccupied to make people sin, as says: “and to you shall be his desire.” Yet if one wishes, one can rule over the Evil Inclination, as says: “and you shall rule over him.” The Rabbis taught in a Baraita that the Evil Inclination is hard to bear, since even God its Creator called it evil, as in God says, “the desire of man’s heart is evil from his youth.” Rav Isaac taught that a person’s Evil Inclination renews itself against that person daily, as says, “Every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil "every day".” And Rabbi Simeon ben Levi (or others say Rabbi Simeon ben Lakish) taught that a person’s Evil Inclination gathers strength against that person daily and seeks to slay that person, as says, “The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.” And if God were not to help a person, one would not be able to prevail against one’s Evil Inclination, for as says, “The Lord will not leave him in his hand.”
Rav taught that the evil inclination resembles a fly, which dwells between the two entrances of the heart, as says, “Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumers fetid and putrid.” But Samuel said that the evil inclination is a like a kind of wheat (, "chitah"), as says, “Sin (, "chatat") couches at the door.” (The Talmudic commentator Maharsha read Samuel’s teaching to relate to the view that the forbidden fruit of which Adam ate was wheat.
Reading the words of “And Cain spoke to Abel his brother,” a Midrash imagined the subject of their discussion. The Midrash taught that they divided the world between them. The first took the land and the second took the movables. The first told the second that he was standing on the first’s land. The second retorted that the first was wearing the second’s clothes. The second told the first to strip off his clothes. The first retorted that the second should fly off his ground. Out of this quarrel, as reports, “Cain rose up against his brother Abel.” Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in Rabbi Levi's name, however, that Cain and Abel quarreled because one said that the Temple would have to be built in his area, while the other claimed that it would have to be built in his. For says, “And it came to pass, when they were in the field,” and “field” refers to the Temple, as equates the two when it says, “Zion (that is, the Temple) shall be plowed as a field.” Out of this argument (in the words of ), “Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.” Judah the son of Rabbi, however, said that their quarrel was about the first Eve. But Rabbi Aibu said that the first Eve had by then returned to dust. Rav Huna taught that Cain and Abel quarreled over an additional twin daughter who was born with Abel, whom each brother claimed for his own. Cain said that he would have her, because he was the firstborn, while Abel maintained that he would have to have her, because she was born with him.
Reading the words of “And Cain rose up against his brother Abel,” Rabbi Johanan taught that Abel was stronger than Cain, for the expression “rose up” implies that Cain lay beneath Abel (as if they had already fought and Abel had thrown Cain down). From the ground, Cain asked Abel what he would tell their father if Abel killed him. At this, Abel was filled with pity for Cain and relented, and immediately Cain rose against Abel and killed him. Out of that incident was born the proverb, “Do not do good to an evil man, then evil will not befall you.”
The Mishnah taught that court officials admonished witnesses testifying in capital cases to beware that the blood of the defendant and all the defendant’s offspring to the end of the world depended on the witness, for says concerning Cain that “the bloods of your brother cry . . . from the ground,” using the plural “bloods” to signify the victim’s blood and the blood of the victim’s offspring. And thus Providence considers one who destroys a single person as one who has destroyed an entire world, and Providence considers one who saves a single person as one who has saved an entire world. The Mishnah reported that another interpretation of “brother's bloods” was that Abel’s blood spattered in several places on the surrounding trees and stones.
Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai compared Cain and Abel to two gladiators fighting before a king. Had the king wished, he could have separated them, but he did not do so. One overcame the other and killed him. Before he died, the victim cried out to the king for help. Rabbi Simeon thus noted that changing one letter in would cause God’s statement to read, “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out "against Me."” Rabbi Simeon said that it is difficult to say this thing, and the mouth cannot utter it plainly (but by God’s inaction, God was involved in Abel’s murder).
Reading in that God said, "every living substance (, "yekum") that I have made will I blot out," Rabbi Abin taught that this included the one who rose up (, "yakam") against his brother — Cain. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Resh Lakish that God kept Cain’s judgment in suspense until the Flood and then God swept Cain away. And thus Rabbi Levi read to say, "And He blotted out every one that had arisen."
Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said that Naamah, the sister of Tubal-cain, mentioned in was Noah's wife. She was called Naamah, because her deeds were pleasing ("ne'imim"). But the Rabbis said that Naamah was a woman of a different stamp, for her name denotes that she sang ("man'emet") to the timbrel in honor of idolatry.
Genesis chapter 5.
The Mishnah taught that enumerated ten generations from Adam to Noah to demonstrate how patient God is, for according to the Mishnah, all those generations provoked God, until God brought on them the waters of the flood.
Rabbi Tanhuma taught in Rabbi Banayah's name, and Rabbi Berekiah taught in Rabbi Eleazar's name, that God created Adam a shapeless mass, and Adam lay stretching from one end of the world to the other, as says, “Your eyes did see my shapeless mass.” Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Simon taught that while Adam lay a shapeless mass before God, God showed Adam every succeeding generation of mankind and its Sages, judges, scribes, interpreters, and leaders. God told Adam, in the words of “Your eyes did see unformed substance,” Adam’s potential descendants, and God told Adam that all of those descendants had already been written in the book of Adam, as says: “This is the book of the generations of Adam.”
Rabbi Eleazar read the words of “male and female created He them, and called their name ‘man,’” and deduced that one cannot be called a complete “man” unless one is married.
The Mishnah taught that a man should not give up trying to be fruitful and multiply unless he has children. The House of Shammai said unless he has two boys. The House of Hillel said unless he has a boy and a girl, since says, “male and female created He them.”
It was taught in a Baraita that when King Ptolemy brought together 72 elders, placed them in 72 separate rooms without telling them why, and directed each of them to translate the Torah, God prompted each one of them and they all conceived the same idea and wrote for “Male and female He created him” (instead of “created them,” to prevent readers from reading that God created more than one person at the start).
Noting that says of Enoch not that he died, but that “God took him,” some sectarians (Judeo-Christians or Christians) challenged Rabbi Abbahu, saying that they did not find that Enoch died, but that God “took” him, just as says that God would “take” Elijah. Rabbi Abbahu reasoned that one could read the verb “took” in just as “take” is used in which says, “Behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes,” and there “take” definitely refers to death.
Also interpreting Rabbi Aibu taught that Enoch was a hypocrite, acting sometimes righteously and sometimes wickedly. So God removed Enoch while Enoch was acting righteously, judging Enoch on Rosh Hashanah, when God judges the whole world.
Genesis chapter 6.
Rabbi Levi, or some say Rabbi Jonathan, said that a tradition handed down from the Men of the Great Assembly taught that wherever the Bible employs the term “and it was” or “and it came to pass” (, "wa-yehi"), as it does in it indicates misfortune, as one can read "wa-yehi" as "wai", "hi", “woe, sorrow.” Thus the words, “And it came to pass when man began to multiply,” in are followed by the words, “God Saw that the wickedness of man was great,” in And the Gemara also cited the instances of followed by followed by followed by the rest of followed by followed by followed by close after followed by followed by the rest of and followed by Haman. But the Gemara also cited as counterexamples the words, “And there was evening and there was morning one day,” in as well as and So Rav Ashi replied that "wa-yehi" sometimes presages misfortune, and sometimes it does not, but the expression “and it came to pass in the days of” always presages misfortune. And for that proposition, the Gemara cited and 
Reading the words of “the sons of God (, "bene elohim") saw the daughters of men,” Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai called them “the sons of "nobles",” and Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai cursed all who called them “the sons of God.” Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that all real demoralization proceeds from the leaders, as they are in a position to stop it. Rabbi Haninah and Resh Lakish reasoned that calls them “the sons of God” because they lived a long time without trouble or suffering.
Rav Huna said in Rav Joseph's name that the generation of the flood were not blotted out from the world until they composed nuptial songs (or others say, wrote marriage contracts) in honor of pederasty and bestiality.
The Mishnah concluded that the generation of the Flood and the generation of the dispersion after the Tower of Babel were both so evil as to have no share in the world to come. Rabbi Akiba deduced from the words of that the generation of the flood will have no portion in the world to come; he read the words “and every living substance was destroyed” to refer to this world and the words “that was on the face of the ground” to refer to the next world. Rabbi Judah ben Bathyra deduced from the words “My spirit will not always enter into judgment with man” of that God will neither revive nor judge the generation of the flood on Judgment Day.
Noting that calls Noah “a man” (, "ish"), a Midrash taught that wherever Scripture employs the term “a man” (, "ish"), it indicates a righteous man who warned his generation. The Midrash taught that for 120 years (deduced from ), Noah planted cedars and cut them down. When they would ask him what he was doing, he would reply that God had informed him that God was bringing a flood. Noah’s contemporaries replied that if a flood did come, it would come only on Noah’s father’s house. Rabbi Abba taught that God said that one herald arose for God in the generation of the Flood — Noah. But they despised him and called him a contemptible old man.
Reading in that “it came to pass, after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth,” the Gemara asked what the nature of these seven days was (that God delayed the flood on their account). Rav taught that these were the days of mourning for Methuselah, and thus that lamenting the righteous postpones retribution. Another explanation is that during “the seven days” God reversed the order of nature (, "bereishit") (established at the beginning of creation), and the sun rose in the west and set in the east (so that sinners might be shocked into repentance). Another explanation is that God first appointed for them a long time (the 120 years to which alludes), and then a short time (a seven-day grace period in which to repent). Another explanation is that during “the seven days,” God gave them a foretaste of the world to come, so that they might know the nature of the rewards of which they were depriving themselves.
The Tosefta taught that the flood killed people before animals (as seen in the order of ), because man sinned first (as shown in ).
Rabbi Johanan taught that because the corruption of the generation of the Flood was great, their punishment was also great. characterizes their corruption as great (, "rabbah"), saying, “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth.” And characterizes their punishment as great (, "rabbah"), saying, “on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up.” Rabbi Johanan reported that three of those great thermal fountains remained open after the Flood — the gulf of Gaddor, the hot-springs of Tiberias, and the great well of Biram.
In the heart grieves. A Midrash catalogued the wide range of additional capabilities of the heart reported in the Hebrew Bible. The heart speaks, sees, hears, walks, falls, stands, rejoices, cries, is comforted, is troubled, becomes hardened, grows faint, fears, can be broken, becomes proud, rebels, invents, cavils, overflows, devises, desires, goes astray, lusts, is refreshed, can be stolen, is humbled, is enticed, errs, trembles, is awakened, loves, hates, envies, is searched, is rent, meditates, is like a fire, is like a stone, turns in repentance, becomes hot, dies, melts, takes in words, is susceptible to fear, gives thanks, covets, becomes hard, makes merry, acts deceitfully, speaks from out of itself, loves bribes, writes words, plans, receives commandments, acts with pride, makes arrangements, and aggrandizes itself.
The School of Rabbi Ishmael deduced from that death was decreed against Noah too, but that he found favor in the eyes of God.
In medieval rabbinic interpretation.
The parashah is discussed in these medieval rabbinic sources:
Genesis chapter 1.
According to the Zohar, the "Tree bearing fruit with its seed in it" in signifies the "Light" of God mentioned in which early in creation impregnated the Rose of the Shechinah.
Genesis chapter 4.
Judah Halevi taught that Adam lived on the land that contained the Cave of Machpelah, and it was the first object of jealousy and envy between Cain and Abel. The two brothers wanted to know which of them would succeed Adam and inherit his essence, intrinsic perfection, and land — who would stand in connection with the Divine Influence, while the other would be a nonentity. When Cain killed Abel, the realm was without an heir. Judah Halevi interpreted the words of “Cain went out of the presence of Lord,” to mean that Cain left that land, telling God (in the words of ), “Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the earth, and from Your Face shall I be hidden.”
Rashi interpreted God’s words “at the entrance sin is lying” in to mean that at the entrance of one’s grave, one’s sin is preserved.
Nachmanides read God’s words “And unto you is its longing” in to teach that sin longs to cleave to a person at all times. Nevertheless, teaches “you may rule over it” if one so desires, for one may mend one’s ways and remove it. Thus in Nachmanides read God to teach Cain concerning repentance, that it lay within Cain’s power to return anytime he desired, and God would forgive him.
Maimonides read to refer to the evil inclination ("yetzer ha-ra"). Maimonides taught that the three terms — the adversary (, "ha-satan"), the evil inclination ("yetzer ha-ra"), and the angel of death — all designate the same thing. And actions ascribed to these three are in reality the actions of one and the same agent. Maimonides taught that the Hebrew term , "satan" was derived from the same root as the word , "seteh", “turn away,” as in and thus implies the notion of turning and moving away from a thing. Thus, the adversary turns people away from the way of truth, and leads them astray in the way of error. Maimonides taught that the same idea is contained in “And the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth.” Maimonides reported that the Sages also said that people receive the evil inclination at birth, for says, “at the door sin crouches,” and says, “And the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth.” The good inclination, however, is developed. Maimonides taught that the Sages refer to the evil inclination and the good inclination when they tell that every person is accompanied by two angels, one on the right side and one on the left, one good and one bad.
In modern interpretation.
The parashah is discussed in these modern sources:
Genesis chapter 1.
Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (the RaMCHaL) posited that God’s purpose in creation was to give a gift from God’s good to another being. Since God is perfect, it would have been insufficient for God to give merely a partial good. Rather, God would have to give the ultimate good that God’s creation — humankind — could receive. As God is the true good, that ultimate good is found in God. Allowing God’s creatures to become more attached to God would thus allow them to experience this ultimate receivable good. Thus, the purpose of creation was to bring into existence a creature who could derive pleasure from God’s own good. God further recognized that for humanity to most enjoy this good, humanity would have to feel that humanity had earned it. God therefore arranged that humanity be able to perceive right and wrong, and have access to both. God thus gave humanity the means to earn the attachment to God that God sought to give.
Commandments.
According to the Sefer ha-Chinuch, a noted authority on the commandments, there is one positive commandment in the parashah:
Maimonides, however, attributes the commandment to 
Most rabbis agree, based on the Shulchan Aruch, that one does not "have" to have children but merely "try" to. Raising adopted children as your own also fulfils this mitzvah.
Haftarah.
The haftarah is a text selected from the books of Nevi'im ("The Prophets") that is read publicly in the synagogue after the reading of the Torah. The haftarah usually has a thematic link to the Torah reading that precedes it. The haftarah for Bereishit is:
Connection to the parashah.
The parashah and haftarah in both report God’s absolute power. and both tell of God’s creation of heaven and earth. The haftarah in 16 echoes the word “light” (and God’s control of it) from but puts the word to broader use. And the haftarah puts the idea of “opening . . . eyes” (in ) in more favorable light than does the parashah (in ).
In the liturgy.
The first word of , "bereishit", and thus God’s role as Creator, is recited in the "Aleinu" prayer near the end of each of the three daily prayer services.
God’s creation of heaven and earth in is reflected in which is in turn one of the six Psalms recited at the beginning of the Kabbalat Shabbat prayer service.
The waters of creation in may be reflected in which is in turn one of the six Psalms recited at the beginning of the Kabbalat Shabbat prayer service.
At the beginning of the K’riat Sh’ma prayer service, following the "Barchu", Jews recite a blessing that acknowledges God’s miracle of creation, noting, among other acts, God’s “separating day from night,” as recounted in 
In the Passover Haggadah, if the Seder takes place on Friday night, then many Jews recite or at the beginning of the "Kiddush" section of the Seder.
Following the Kabbalat Shabbat service and prior to the Friday evening ("Ma'ariv") service, Jews traditionally read rabbinic sources on the observance of the Sabbath, including an excerpt from Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 119b. In Shabbat 119b, Rava instructed that one should recite on the eve of the Sabbath.
The Lekhah Dodi liturgical poem of the Kabbalat Shabbat prayer service reflects the role of the Sabbath described in characterizing the Sabbath as the “last of the work (of Creation)” ("sof ma’aseh").
Reuven Kimelman found in the “awake and arise” stanza of the Lekhah Dodi poem a play between the root "or", from which stems the word for “skin” or “leather,” and the homonym "or" that means “light.” In Adam exchanged garments of light for garments of leather; the Lekhah Dodi poem calls on God to exchange our current garments of skin for garments of light.
The “Divine beings” or “sons of God” mentioned in are reflected in which is in turn one of the six Psalms recited at the beginning of the Kabbalat Shabbat prayer service.
The Weekly Maqam.
In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews each week base the songs of the services on the content of that week's parashah. For Parashah Bereshit, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Rast, the maqam that shows a beginning or an initiation of something. In this case it is appropriate, because we are initiating the Book of Genesis.

Paul Bragg

Paul Chappius Bragg (February 6, 1895 – December 7, 1976), nutritionist, was a pioneer in America’s wellness movement.
Biography.
Born as Paul Chappius Bragg, Bragg claimed he was born in 1881 in Fairfax County, Virginia, but genealogical research indicates he was born on February 6, 1895 in Batesville, Indiana. He was probably named after his father's younger brother, Paul L. Bragg (who died in childhood and was enumerated at age 1 in the U.S. 1870 Census for Wayne County, Indiana).
Bragg grew up in Washington, D.C. with his parents, Robert Elton Bragg (1866-1944) and Caroline (Chappius) Bragg (1859-1934). He had two brothers, James Elton and John Harrison Bragg. His father was employed by the U.S. Printing Office. ("Robert E. Bragg, 77, retired government printer...died Monday at his home...Surviving are his wife, Mrs. Tyler Bragg, Miami, three sons, James of New York, Paul and John, both of Burbank, Calif.;..." Robert E. Bragg obituary, Miami Herald, February 15, 1944). However, in the 1972 Edition of the Bragg Apple Cider Vinegar System booklet, at page 12, and in later editions, Bragg claimed both that his father was "a splendid farmer" and that "I am the oldest of 16 children".
At some point, Bragg enlisted with the Washington D.C. National Guard for "three Years", as is shown on his 1917 Draft Registration, which he filed with the Indianapolis, Indiana draft board that year.
Although Paul Bragg had claimed participation in both the 1908 (London) and 1912 (Stockholm) Olympics as a member of the U.S. Wrestling Team, the "Encyclopedia of American Wrestling" (Pub. 1988, Mike Chapman, author) does not show any such person as a member in either year.
In 1915 Bragg married Neva Parnin at the Chapel of St. Barnabas in New York City. They moved to Indianapolis, where Bragg became an agent with The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.
Several years later, Bragg returned to the East Coast and was employed by various YMCAs & school districts in physical or athletic director capacities, his last known position before moving to California being football coach for the 1920 season at Connersville High School, Connersville, PA. ("New Physical Instructor, Paul Bragg, Will Be Coach Of C.H.S. Eleven", The Connersville Daily Courier, July 31, 1920).
In 1921 Bragg and his family, now also including two young daughters, Neva Pauline/Polly and Lorraine Agnes Bragg (both born in Washington, D.C. on 10/14/1917 & 10/3/1919, respectively), came to California, where Paul was again employed by the YMCA (Los Angeles Times, 9/28/1921). Son, Robert Elton, was born in Los Angeles County on March 25, 1922. It is unknown how long Bragg stayed with the Los Angeles "Y", but in 1924 he was a physical education teacher at Redondo Union High School, Redondo Beach, CA.("Calling All Grads of Class of 1924", Van Nuys Valley News, March 31, 1974.)
Circa 1926, Paul Bragg apparently left paid employment and became an entrepreneur in the health field, first by opening an establishment on N. 7th Street, Los Angeles, called "Health Center of Los Angeles" and then, in 1928, "Bragg Health Center" on South Hill Street, Los Angeles. Likely to publicize these businesses, he also wrote a weekly health column (in the early days they were "advertorials") in The Los Angeles Times from 1926 to 1928 which he sometimes called "Newslets" and other times "Health Notes". The health services that business endeavors offered are described in the advertorials and columns.
Lecturing.
1929 was the beginning of Paul Bragg's health lecture tours where he went to various American cities (for instance, San Antonio & Dallas, Texas in 1929; Oakland, California & Denver, Colorado in 1930), rented a facility, advertised heavily, then gave a series of lectures—usually over a period of five or six consecutive evenings. His lectures were free, but he did charge a fee for post-lecture private consultation. ($20 circa 1935 according to testimony in a Maryland court case against him).
1929 was also the copyright year of the first health book attributed to Paul Bragg as author, "Cure Yourself". Since book stores or book departments in retail stores in that era were usually only accessible in the more highly populated areas, another purpose of Bragg's lecture tours was most likely to promote and sell his books.
Divorce.
During the Braggs' first decade in California, Paul & Neva Bragg divorced, and in the 1930 U.S. Census, Neva & her new husband, August Busch, were shown living with the three Bragg children in Los Angeles, CA. 
The Florida Marriage Index documents the marriage of Paul Bragg and Betty Brownlee (born Gertrude Elizabeth Brownlee 6 July 1902, Eau Claire, WI) on 17 Feb. 1930 in Clearwater, Pinellas County, Florida. On their Application for Marriage, Miss Brownlee gave her occupation as Advance Manager for the Bragg lectures. However, the following year, Gertrude Elizabeth Bragg filed for divorce against Paul C. Bragg in Los Angeles County Superior Court, which Divorce Decree was granted in January 1932. There is currently no indication that Paul Bragg ever remarried.
There is no record of Paul Bragg being counted in the 1930 U.S. Census, although Burbank, CA city directories of the time reflect his residence in that city from 1935 to 1954, and that his food manufacturing company, Live Food Products, Inc., was also located there during that period. Subsequently he relocated to Desert Hot Springs, CA, and later in the 1960s, at least part-time, to Hawaii.
Death.
Bragg was reported to have died of a heart attack in the emergency room of South Shore Hospital in Miami, Florida on December 7, 1976.
Education.
Although Bragg claimed advanced scientific degrees in newspaper and magazine interviews, including, but not limited to, his 1975 People Magazine article, it is unknown if these claims are accurate. The most recently released 1940 Federal Census (April 2012, accessible on-line), showing him living on National Avenue in Burbank, California, gives his age as "45" and the highest attained academic grade for him as "H1", which would be only one year of high school. None of the known Bragg books refers to any specific educational accomplishments, although a 1977 publication "The Shocking Truth about Water" he co-authored with Patricia Bragg appends the titles of N.D. and Ph.D. behind his name.
Legacy.
Bragg advocated using deep breathing, water fasts, organic foods, drinking distilled water, juicing, exercise, listening to one's body and many other techniques as methods of prolonging life span. Until he died at a believed age of 95, Paul stated that every human being could, at least in theory, live to 120 by following his regimen.
Patricia Bragg, Paul's former daughter-in-law, according to official records, has since taken over Bragg's health empire, having previously married Bragg's son, Robert Elton Bragg, on 04/19/1952 in Phoenix, Maricopa County, AZ, and divorced him on 03/29/1957 in Los Angeles County, CA. She has stated that she was legally adopted by Paul.
Bragg was the inspiration and personal health and fitness advisor to top Olympic stars from 3-time swimming Gold Medalist Murray Rose to 4-time track Gold Medalist Betty Cuthbert of Australia, his relative (pole-vaulting Gold Medalist), Don Bragg and others. Jack LaLanne, the original TV Fitness King said, “Bragg saved my life at age 15 when I attended the Bragg Crusade in Oakland, California."
Paul Bragg also wrote many successful books, such as "The Miracle of Fasting", as well as the "Live Food Cook Book and Menus" (Hollywood, California: Live Food Products, Inc., 1930).

Urszula Dudziak

Urszula Bogumiła Dudziak-Urbaniak (born 22 October 1943) is a leading Polish jazz vocalist. She has worked with artists such as Krzysztof Komeda, Michał Urbaniak (her ex-husband), Gil Evans, Archie Shepp, and Lester Bowie. Her 1970s song, Papaya, gained widespread popularity in Asia and Latin America in 2007.
History.
Dudziak was born in the Straconka neighborhood of Bielsko-Biała, Poland. She studied piano, but began to sing in the late 50s after hearing records by Ella Fitzgerald. Within a few years she was one of the most popular jazz artists in her native country. She met and later married Michał Urbaniak. In the late 60s they began to tour overseas and in the 70s settled in New York.
Dudziak has some problems with language and customarily eschews words in favour of wordless vocalizing that is far more adventurous than scat. Already gifted with a remarkable five-octave vocal range, Dudziak employs electronic devices to extend still further the possibilities of her voice. She has frequently worked with leading contemporary musicians, including Archie Shepp and Lester Bowie, and was a member of the Vocal Summit group, with Jay Clayton, Jeanne Lee, Bobby McFerrin, Norma Winstone, Sting, Michelle Hendricks, and Lauren Newton. Dudziak has also cooperated and performed with her fellow Polish female jazz vocalist Grażyna Auguścik.
On November 11, 2009, Dudziak was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta by President Lech Kaczyński.
Personal life.
Dudziak and Michał Urbaniak are divorced, together they have two daughters: pop singer Mika (Michelle, born 1980) and Kasia. After the divorce she was in a relationship with Jerzy Kosiński for four years. In 1993 she married Swedish captain Benght Dahllof. Dudziak owns apartments in Manhattan, Sweden and Warsaw.
On 8 March 2011, she released her autobiography called "Wyśpiewam wam wszystko" (I'll sing everything for you).
Papaya dance.
In 2007, Dudziak's classic 1970s song "Papaya" saw a resurgence in popularity in the Philippines where it was regularly featured in a local noontime TV game show Pilipinas, Game KNB?. A favorite track for Filipino drag queens as lip-synch material in the '70s gay disco/bar scene, the song then saw a revival when a TV host danced to the tune, helping to spread the popularity of the song to Latin America and the US. The dance has then been featured in several news programs, including "MSNBC", and "Reuters". On 21 March 2008, the dance was featured on ABC's "Good Morning America", where the hosts also danced to the song.

Armstrong Siddeley Viper

The Viper is a British turbojet engine developed and produced by Armstrong Siddeley and then by its successor companies Bristol Siddeley and Rolls-Royce Limited. It entered service in 1953 and remained in use with the Royal Air Force, powering its Dominie T1 navigation training aircraft until January 2011.
Design and development.
The design originally featured a seven-stage compressor based on their Adder engine — the Viper is in effect a large-scale Adder.
Like the similar J85 built in United States, the Viper was developed as an expendable engine for powering production versions of the Jindivik target drone, but, again like the J85, the limited-life materials and total-loss oil systems were replaced with standard systems for use in manned aircraft.
Because it was initially developed as an expendable engine, the Viper was subject to many recurring maintenance issues. This led to the development of the first Power by the Hour program in which operators would pay a fixed hourly rate to Bristol Siddeley for the continual maintenance of the engines.

At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim

Aṭ-Ṭayyib Abī'l-Qāṣim ibn al-Manṣūr () was, according to "Ṭāyyibī Mustā‘līd Ismāʿīlī Muslims," the 21st and the last Fatimid Imām (the hereditary leader of the Muslim community in the direct line of ‘Ali). Abī l-Qāṣim was the son of the 20th Fatimid Imām, Mansur al-Amir Bi-Ahkamillah who ruled Egypt from 1101-1130. He was born in Al-Moizziyyatul Qaherah on Sunday the 4th of Rabiul Aakher, 524 AH or 1130 AD, and he was only a few months old when his father assassinated by Hassan-i Sabbah Assassins on 1130 AD.
Ṭayyib in The Occultation.
According to "Ṭāyyibī Mustā‘līd" tradition, before Ṭāyyib went into seclusion his father al-Amir instructed Queen al-Hurrah Arwa al-Sulayhi in Yemen to anoint a vicegerent after the seclusion. The vicegerent, or Da'i al-Mutlaq, would have full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal. She appointed Da'i Zoeb bin musa as First Dai in Yemen.
Mustā‘lī Da'is.
The line of the Da'is continued until the 24th Dai Yusuf Najmuddin ibn Sulaiman in Yemen. On behalf of Da'i of Yemen, there were Wali ("representative" or "caretaker") of the Fatimid Dawat appointed in India.
Due to prosecution by the local ruler in Yemen, the Dawat then shifted to India under the 25th Da'i Jalal Shamshuddin. This is continued till date , and at present the largest Taiyabi-descended faction, the Dawoodi Bohra Da'wa is headed by 53rd Da'i Mufaddal Saifuddin. The other factions of Sulaimani Bohra are headed by their 52nd Da'i Al-Fakhri Abdullah, and the Alavi Bohra are headed by their 44th Da'i Abu Hatim Tayyib Ziyauddin.
Hafizi Ismāʿīlīs and Ṭāyyibī Mustā‘līs.
"Hafizi Mustā‘lī Ismāʿīlīs" were those who continued to accept the legitimacy of the Fatimid rulers of Egypt between 1130-1169 instead of aṭ-Ṭayyib Abī l-Qāṣim. After the end of their rule by Saladin they are apparently extinct.

Risk pool

A risk pool is one of the forms of risk management mostly practiced by insurance companies. Under this system, insurance companies come together to form a pool, which can provide protection to insurance companies against catastrophic risks such as floods, earthquakes etc. The term is also used to describe the pooling of similar risks that underlies the concept of insurance. While risk pooling is necessary for insurance to work, not all risks can be effectively pooled. In particular, it is difficult to pool dissimilar risks in a voluntary insurance bracket, unless there is a subsidy available to encourage participation.
Risk pooling is an important concept in supply chain management. Risk pooling suggests that demand variability is reduced if one aggregates demand across locations because as demand is aggregated across different locations, it becomes more likely that high demand from one customer will be offset by low demand from another. This reduction in variability allows a decrease in safety stock and therefore reduces average inventory.
For example: in the centralized distribution system, the warehouse serves all customers, which leads to a reduction in variability measured by either the standard deviation or the coefficient of variation.
The three critical points to risk pooling are: 
In government.
Intergovernmental risk pools (IRPs) operate under the same general principle, except that they are made up of public entities, such as government agencies. Thus, IRPs provide alternative risk financing and transfer mechanisms to their members, through which particular types of risk are underwritten with contributions (premiums), with losses and expenses shared in agreed ratios. In other words, Intergovernmental Risk Pools are a cooperative group of governmental entities joining together to finance an exposure, liability or risk.
Intergovernmental risk pools may include, but are not limited to, authorities, joint power authorities, associations, agencies, trusts, and other risk pools.

Lech-Lecha

Lech-Lecha, Lekh-Lekha, or Lech-L'cha ( — Hebrew for "go!" or "leave!" or "go for you" — the fifth and sixth words in the parashah) is the third weekly Torah portion (, "parashah") in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading. It constitutes The parashah is made up of 6,336 Hebrew letters, 1,686 Hebrew words, and 126 verses, and can occupy about 208 lines in a Torah Scroll (, "Sefer Torah"). Jews read it on the third Sabbath after Simchat Torah, generally in October or November.
The parashah tells the stories of God’s calling of Abram (who would become Abraham), Abram’s passing off his wife Sarai as his sister, Abram’s dividing the land with his nephew Lot, the war between the four kings and the five, the covenant between the pieces, Sarai’s tensions with her maid Hagar and Hagar’s son Ishmael, and the covenant of circumcision (, "brit milah").
Readings.
In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , "aliyot". In the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Parashah Lech-Lecha has three "open portion" (, "petuchah") divisions (roughly equivalent to paragraphs, often abbreviated with the Hebrew letter ("peh")). Parashah Lech-Lecha has several further subdivisions, called "closed portion" (, "setumah") divisions (abbreviated with the Hebrew letter ("samekh")) within the open portion (, "petuchah") divisions. The first open portion (, "petuchah") divides the first reading (, "aliyah"). The second open portion (, "petuchah"), covers the balance of the first and all of the second and third readings (, "aliyot"). The third open portion (, "petuchah") spans the remaining readings (, "aliyot"). Closed portion (, "setumah") divisions further divide the fifth and sixth readings (, "aliyot").
First reading.
In the first reading (, "aliyah"), God told Abram to leave his native land and his father’s house for a land that God would show him, promising to make of him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, bless those who blessed him, and curse those who cursed him. Following God’s command, at age 75, Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and the wealth and persons that they had acquired in Haran, and traveled to the terebinth of Moreh, at Shechem in Canaan. God appeared to Abram to tell him that God would assign the land to his heirs, and Abram built an altar to God. Abram then moved to the hill country east of Bethel and built an altar to God there and invoked God by name. Then Abram journeyed toward the Negeb. The first open portion (, "petuchah") ends here.
In the continuation of the reading, famine struck the land, so Abram went down to Egypt, asking Sarai to say that she was his sister so that the Egyptians would not kill him. The first reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Second reading.
In the second reading (, "aliyah"), when Abram and Sarai entered Egypt, Pharaoh’s courtiers praised Sarai’s beauty to Pharaoh, and she was taken into Pharaoh’s palace. Pharaoh took Sarai as his wife. Because of her, Abram acquired sheep, oxen, donkeys, slaves, and camels, but God afflicted Pharaoh and his household with mighty plagues. Pharaoh questioned Abram why he had not told Pharaoh that Sarai was Abram’s wife, but had said that she was his sister. Pharaoh returned Sarai to Abram and had his men take them away with all their possessions. Abram, Sarai, and Lot returned to the altar near Bethel. The second reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Third reading.
In the third reading (, "aliyah"), Abram and Lot now had so many sheep and cattle that the land could not support them both, and their herdsmen quarreled. Abram proposed to Lot that they separate, inviting Lot to choose which land he would take. Lot saw how well watered the plain of the Jordan was, so he chose it for himself, and journeyed eastward, settling near Sodom, a city of very wicked sinners, while Abram remained in Canaan. God promised to give all the land that Abram could see to him and his offspring forever, and to make his offspring as numerous as the dust of the earth. Abram moved to the terebinths of Mamre in Hebron, and built an altar there to God. The third reading (, "aliyah") and the second open portion (, "petuchah") end here with the end of chapter 
Fourth reading.
In the fourth reading (, "aliyah"), in chapter the Mesopotamian Kings Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tidal of Goiim made war on the Canaanite kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Zoar, who joined forces at the Valley of Siddim, now the Dead Sea. The Canaanite kings had served Chedorlaomer for twelve years, but rebelled in the thirteenth year. In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the Mesopotamian kings with him went on a military campaign and defeated several peoples in and around Canaan: the Rephaim, the Zuzim, the Emim, the Horites, the Amalekites, and the Amorites. Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Zoar engaged the four Mesopotamian kings in battle in the Valley of Siddim. The Mesopotamians routed the Canaanites, and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled into bitumen pits in the valley, while the rest escaped to the hill country. The Mesopotamians seized all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah, as well as Lot and his possessions, and departed. A fugitive brought the news to Abram, who mustered his 318 retainers, and pursued the invaders north to Dan. Abram and his servants defeated them at night, chased them north of Damascus, and brought back all the people and possessions, including Lot and his possessions. When Abram returned, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh, the Valley of the King. King Melchizedek of Salem (Jerusalem), a priest of God Most High, brought out bread and wine and blessed Abram and God Most High, and Abram gave him a tenth of everything. The fourth reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Fifth reading.
In the fifth reading (, "aliyah"), the king of Sodom offered Abram to keep all the possessions if he would merely return the people, but Abram swore to God Most High not to take so much as a thread or a sandal strap from Sodom, but would take only shares for the men who went with him. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here with the end of chapter 
As the reading (, "aliyah") continues in chapter some time later, the word of God appeared to Abram, saying not to fear, for his reward would be very great, but Abram questioned what God could give him, as he was destined to die childless, and his steward Eliezer of Damascus would be his heir. The word of God replied that Eliezer would not be his heir, Abram’s own son would. God took Abram outside and bade him to count the stars, for so numerous would his offspring be, and because Abram put his trust in God, God reckoned it to his merit. The fifth reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Sixth reading.
In the sixth reading (, "aliyah"), God directed Abram to bring three heifers, three goats, three rams, a turtledove, and a bird, to cut the non-birds in two, and to place each half opposite the other. Abram drove away birds of prey that came down upon the carcasses, and as the sun was about to set, he fell into a deep sleep. God told Abram that his offspring would be strangers in a land not theirs, and be enslaved 400 years, but God would execute judgment on the nation they were to serve, and in the end they would go free with great wealth and return in the fourth generation, after the iniquity of the Amorites was complete. And there appeared a smoking oven, and a flaming torch, which passed between the pieces. And God made a covenant with Abram to assign to his offspring the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates: the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here with the end of chapter 
As the reading continues in chapter having borne no children after 10 years in Canaan, Sarai bade Abram to consort with her Egyptian maidservant Hagar, so that Sarai might have a son through her, and Abram did as Sarai requested. When Hagar saw that she had conceived, Sarai was lowered in her esteem, and Sarai complained to Abram. Abram told Sarai that her maid was in her hands, and Sarai treated her harshly, so Hagar ran away. An angel of God found Hagar by a spring of water in the wilderness, and asked her where she came from and where she was going, and she replied that she was running away from her mistress. The angel told her to go back to her mistress and submit to her harsh treatment, for God would make Hagar’s offspring too numerous to count; she would bear a son whom she should name Ishmael, for God had paid heed to her suffering. Ishmael would be a wild donkey of a man, with his hand against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him, but he would dwell alongside his kinsmen. Hagar called God “El-roi,” meaning that she had gone on seeing after God saw her, and the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. And when Abram was 86 years old, Hagar bore him a son, and Abram gave him the name Ishmael. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here with the end of chapter 
As the reading continues in chapter when Abram was 99 years old, God appeared to Abram as El Shaddai and asked him to walk in God’s ways and be blameless, for God would establish a covenant with him and make him exceedingly numerous. Abram threw himself on his face, and God changed his name from Abram to Abraham, promising to make him the father of a multitude of nations and kings. The sixth reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Seventh reading.
In the seventh reading (, "aliyah"), God promised to maintain the covenant with Abraham and his offspring as an everlasting covenant throughout the ages, and assigned all the land of Canaan to him and his offspring as an everlasting holding. God further told Abraham that he and his offspring throughout the ages were to keep God’s covenant and every male (including every slave) was to be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin at the age of eight days as a sign of the covenant with God. If any male failed to circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that person was to be cut off from his kin for having broken God’s covenant. And God renamed Sarai as Sarah, and told Abraham that God would bless her and give Abraham a son by her so that she would give rise to nations and rulers. Abraham threw himself on his face and laughed at the thought that a child could be born to a man of a hundred and a woman of ninety, and Abraham asked God to bless Ishmael. But God told him that Sarah would bear Abraham a son, and Abraham was to name him Isaac, and God would maintain the everlasting covenant with him and his offspring. In response to Abraham’s prayer, God blessed Ishmael as well and promised to make him exceedingly numerous, the father of twelve chieftains and a great nation. But God would maintain the covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah would bear at the same season the next year. And when God finished speaking, God disappeared. That very day, Abraham circumcised himself, Ishmael, and every male in his household, as God had directed. The maftir () reading that concludes the parashah reports that when Abraham circumcised himself and his household, Abraham was 99 and Ishmael was 13. The seventh reading (, "aliyah"), the third open portion (, "petuchah"), chapter and the parashah end here.
In inner-biblical interpretation.
The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these Biblical sources:
Genesis chapter 12.
While reports that Terah took Abram, Lot, and Sarai from Ur of the Chaldees to Haran, and subsequently reports God’s call to Abram to leave his country and his father’s house, reports that God chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees.
Genesis chapter 15.
While required a new mother to bring a burnt-offering and a sin-offering, and Psalm make clear that having children is a blessing from God; and characterize childlessness as a misfortune; and and threaten childlessness as a punishment.
In early nonrabbinic interpretation.
The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these early nonrabbinic sources:
Genesis chapter 12.
Acts reported that God appeared to Abram while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, and told him to leave his country and his people, and then he left the land of the Chaldeans to settle in Haran. And then after Terah’s death, God sent Abraham to Canaan.
Philo interpreted Abram’s migration allegorically as the story of a soul devoted to virtue and searching for the true God.
In classical rabbinic interpretation.
The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud:
Genesis chapter 12.
The Mishnah taught that Abraham suffered ten trials and withstood them all, demonstrating how great Abraham’s love of God was.
Similarly, the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that Abraham was tried with ten trials, and he stood firm in them all. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that the first trial was when Abram was born, and all the magnates of the kingdom and the magicians sought to kill him. Abram was hidden in a cave for thirteen years without seeing the sun or moon. After thirteen years, Abram came out speaking the holy language, Hebrew, and he despised idols and held in abomination the graven images, and he trusted in God, saying (in the words of ): “Blessed is the man who trusts in You.” In the second trial, Abram was put in prison for ten years — three years in Kuthi, seven years in Budri. After ten years, they brought him out and cast him into the furnace of fire, and God delivered him from the furnace of fire, as says, “And He said to him, ‘I am the Lord who brought you out of the furnace of the Chaldees.” Similarly, reports, “You are the Lord the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of the furnace of the Chaldees.” The third trial was Abram’s migration from his father’s house and from the land of his birth. God brought him to Haran, and there his father Terah died, and Athrai his mother. The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer taught that migration is harder for a human than for any other creature. And tells of his migration when it says, “Now the Lord said to Abram, ‘Get out.’”
Rabbi Hiyya said that Abram's father Terah manufactured idols (as implies), and once Terah went away and left Abram to mind the store. A man came and asked to buy an idol. Abram asked the man how old he was. The man replied that he was 50 years old. Abram exclaimed that it was a shame that a man of 50 would worship a day-old object. The man became embarrassed and left. On another occasion, a woman came with a plate of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols. Abram took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol’s hand. When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he had done. Abram told Terah that the idols fought among themselves to be fed first, and the largest broke the others with the stick. Terah asked Abram why he made sport of him, for the idols had no consciousness. Abram replied by asking Terah to listen to what he had just said. Thereupon Terah seized Abram and delivered him to Nimrod, king of Shinar. Nimrod proposed that they worship the fire. Abram replied that they should rather worship water, which extinguishes fire. Nimrod agreed to worship water. Abram replied that they should rather worship clouds, which bear the water. Nimrod agreed to worship the clouds. Abram replied that they should rather worship the winds, which disperse the clouds. Nimrod agreed to worship the wind. Abram replied that they should rather worship human beings, who withstand the wind. Nimrod then accused Abram of just bandying words, and decreed that they would worship nothing but the fire. Nimrod cast Abram into the fire, challenging Abram’s God to save him from it. Haran was standing there undecided. Haran thought to himself that if Abram survived, then Haran would say that he was of Abram's faith, but if Nimrod was victorious, then Haran would say that he was on Nimrod's side. When Abram descended into the fiery furnace, God saved him. Nimrod then asked Haran whose belief he shared. Haran replied that he shared Abram's faith. Thereupon Nimrod cast Haran into the fire, and he died in his father's presence, as reports, “And Haran died in the presence of (, "al pene") his father Terah.”
Rabbi Isaac compared Abram’s thinking to that of a man who was travelling from place to place when he saw a building in flames. He wondered whether it was possible that the building could lack a person to look after it. At that moment, the owner of the building appeared and said that he owned the building. Similarly, Abram questioned whether it was conceivable that the world could exist without a Guide to look after it. At that moment, God told Abram that God is the Guide, the Sovereign of the Universe. At that moment, in the words of “The Lord said to Abraham: ‘Get out of your country.’”
The Gemara reported that some deduced from that change of place can cancel a man’s doom, but another argued that it was the merit of the land of Israel that availed Abraham.
Rabbi Aha said in the name of Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman (or others say Rabbi Alexandri’s name) in Rabbi Nathan’s name that Abraham knew (and observed) even the laws of the courtyard eruv. Rabbi Phinehas (and others say Rabbi Helkiah and Rabbi Simon) said in the name of Rabbi Samuel that Abraham knew even the new name that God will one day give to Jerusalem, as says, “At that time they shall call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of God.’” Rabbi Berekiah, Rabbi Hiyya, and the Rabbis of Babylonia taught in Rabbi Judah’s name that a day does not pass in which God does not teach a new law in the heavenly Court. For as says, “Hear attentively the noise of His voice, and the meditation that goes out of His mouth.” And meditation refers to nothing but Torah, as says, “You shall meditate therein day and night.” And Abraham knew them all.
Rabbi Eliezer taught that the five Hebrew letters of the Torah that alone among Hebrew letters have two separate shapes (depending whether they are in the middle or the end of a word) — (Kh, M, N, P, Z) — all relate to the mystery of the redemption. With the letter "kaph" (), God redeemed Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees, as in God says, “Get you (, "lekh lekha") out of your country, and from your kindred . . . to the land that I will show you.” With the letter "mem" (), Isaac was redeemed from the land of the Philistines, as in the Philistine king Abimelech told Isaac, “Go from us: for you are much mightier (, "mimenu m’od") than we.” With the letter "nun" (), Jacob was redeemed from the hand of Esau, as in Jacob prayed, “Deliver me, I pray (, "hazileini na"), from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau.” With the letter "pe" (), God redeemed Israel from Egypt, as in God told Moses, “I have surely visited you, (, "pakod pakadeti") and (seen) that which is done to you in Egypt, and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt.” With the letter "tsade" (), God will redeem Israel from the oppression of the kingdoms, and God will say to Israel, I have caused a branch to spring forth for you, as says, “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch (, "zemach"); and he shall grow up (, "yizmach") out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord.” These letters were delivered to Abraham. Abraham delivered them to Isaac, Isaac delivered them to Jacob, Jacob delivered the mystery of the Redemption to Joseph, and Joseph delivered the secret of the Redemption to his brothers, as in Joseph told his brothers, “God will surely visit (, "pakod yifkod") you.” Jacob’s son Asher delivered the mystery of the Redemption to his daughter Serah. When Moses and Aaron came to the elders of Israel and performed signs in their sight, the elders told Serah. She told them that there is no reality in signs. The elders told her that Moses said, “God will surely visit (, "pakod yifkod") you” (as in ). Serah told the elders that Moses was the one who would redeem Israel from Egypt, for she heard (in the words of ), “I have surely visited (, "pakod pakadeti") you.” The people immediately believed in God and Moses, as says, “And the people believed, and when they heard that the Lord had visited the children of Israel.”
Rabbi Berekiah noted that in God had already said, “I will bless you,” and so asked what God added by then saying, “and you be a blessing.” Rabbi Berekiah explained that God was thereby conveying to Abraham that up until that point, God had to bless God’s world, but thereafter, God entrusted the ability to bless to Abraham, and Abraham could thenceforth bless whomever it pleased him to bless.
Rabbi Eleazar interpreted the words, “And in you shall the families of the earth be blessed (, "venivrechu")” in to teach that God told Abram that God had two good shoots to graft ("lihavrich") onto Abram’s family tree: Ruth the Moabitess (whom reports was the ancestor of David) and Naamah the Ammonitess (whom 1 Kings reports was the mother of Rehoboam and thus the ancestor or good kings like Hezekiah). And Rabbi Eleazar interpreted the words, “All the families of the earth,” in to teach that even the other families who live on the earth are blessed only for Israel’s sake.
Rav Judah deduced from that to refuse to say grace when given a cup to bless is one of three things that shorten a man’s life. And Rabbi Joshua ben Levi deduced from that every kohen who pronounces the benediction is himself blessed.
Resh Lakish deduced from that the Torah regards the man who teaches Torah to his neighbor’s son as though he had fashioned him.
Similarly, Rabbi Leazar in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Zimra observed that if all the nations assembled to create one insect they could not bring it to life, yet says, “the souls whom they had made in Haran.” Rabbi Leazar in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Zimra interpreted the words “the souls whom they had made” to refer to the proselytes whom Abram and Sarai had converted. The Midrash asked why then did not simply say, “whom they had converted,” and instead says, “whom they had made.” The Midrash answered that thus teaches that one who brings a nonbeliever near to God is like one who created a life. Noting that does not say, “whom he had made,” but instead says “whom they had made,” Rabbi Hunia taught that Abraham converted the men, and Sarah converted the women.
The Tanna debe Eliyyahu taught that the world is destined to exist for six thousand years. The first two thousand years were to be void, the next two thousand years were the period of the Torah, and the last two thousand years are the period of the Messiah. And the Gemara taught that the two thousand years of the Torah began when, as reports, Abraham and Sarah had gotten souls in Haran, when by tradition Abraham was 52 years old.
The Mishnah equated the terebinth of Moreh to which Abram journeyed in with the terebinths of Moreh to which Moses directed the Israelites to journey in to hear the blessings and curses at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, and the Talmud equated both with Shechem.
Rabbi Elazar said that one should always anticipate misfortune with prayer; for it was only by virtue of Abram’s prayer between Beth-el and Ai reported in that Israel’s troops survived at the Battle of Ai in the days of Joshua.”
The Rabbis deduced from that when there is a famine in town, one should emigrate.
Rav deduced from that Abram had not even looked at his own wife before that point.
Reading the words, “And it came to pass, that, when Abram came into Egypt,” in a Midrash asked why the text at that point mentioned Abraham but not Sarai. The Midrash taught that Abram had put Sarai in a box and locked her in. The Midrash told that when Abram came to the Egyptian customs house, the customs officer demanded that Abram pay the custom duty on the box and its contents, and Abram agreed to pay. The customs officer proposed that Abram must have been carrying garments in the box, and Abram agreed to pay the duty for garments. The customs officer then proposed that Abram must have been carrying silks in the box, and Abram agreed to pay the duty for silks. The customs officer then proposed that Abram must have been carrying precious stones in the box, and Abram agreed to pay the duty for precious stones. But then the customs officer insisted that Abram open the box so that the customs officers could see what it contained. As soon as Abram opened the box, Sarai’s beauty illuminated the land of Egypt.
Rabbi Azariah and Rabbi Jonathan in Rabbi Isaac's name taught that Eve's image was transmitted to the reigning beauties of each generation (setting the standard of beauty). says of David’s comforter Abishag, “And the damsel was very fair” — , "yafah ad me'od" — which the Midrash interpreted to mean that she attained to Eve's beauty (as , "ad me'od", implies , Adam, and thus Eve). And says, “the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair” — , "me'od" — which the Midrash interpreted to mean that Sarai was even more beautiful than Eve. Reading the words, “And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh,” in Rabbi Johanan told that they tried to outbid each other for the right to enter Pharaoh's palace with Sarai. One prince said that he would give a hundred dinars for the right to enter the palace with Sarai, whereupon another bid two hundred dinars.
Rabbi Helbo deduced from that a man must always observe the honor due to his wife, because blessings rest on a man’s home only on account of her.
Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Johanan that leprosy resulted from seven things: slander, bloodshed, vain oath, incest, arrogance, robbery, and envy. The Gemara cited God’s striking Pharaoh with plagues in to show that incest had led to leprosy.
Genesis chapter 13.
A Baraita deduced from the words, “like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt,” in that among all the nations, there was none more fertile than Egypt. And the Baraita taught that there was no more fertile spot in Egypt than Zoan, where kings lived, for says of Pharaoh, “his princes are at Zoan.” And in all of Israel, there was no more rocky ground than that at Hebron, which is why the Patriarchs buried their dead there, as reported in But rocky Hebron was still seven times as fertile as lush Zoan, as the Baraita interpreted the words “and Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt” in to mean that Hebron was seven times as fertile as Zoan. The Baraita rejected the plain meaning of “built,” reasoning that Ham would not build a house for his younger son Canaan (in whose land was Hebron) before he built one for his elder son Mizraim (in whose land was Zoan, and lists (presumably in order of birth) “the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.”
Rabbi Issi taught that there was no city in the plain better than Sodom, for Lot had searched through all the cities of the plain and found none like Sodom. Thus the people of Sodom were the best of all, yet as reports, “the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners.” They were “wicked” to each other, “sinners” in adultery, “against the Lord” in idolatry, and “exceedingly” engaged in bloodshed.
The Mishnah deduced from that the men of Sodom would have no place in the world to come.
Genesis chapter 14.
Rabbi Levi, or some say Rabbi Jonathan, said that a tradition handed down from the Men of the Great Assembly taught that wherever the Bible employs the term “and it was” or “and it came to pass” (, "wa-yehi"), as it does in it indicates misfortune, as one can read "wa-yehi" as "wai", "hi", “woe, sorrow.” Thus the words, “And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel,” in are followed by the words, “they made war,” in And the Gemara also cited the instances of followed by followed by followed by the rest of followed by 1 Samuel followed by followed by close after followed by followed by the rest of and followed by Haman. But the Gemara also cited as counterexamples the words, “And there was evening and there was morning one day,” in as well as and So Rav Ashi replied that "wa-yehi" sometimes presages misfortune, and sometimes it does not, but the expression “and it came to pass in the days of” always presages misfortune. And for that proposition, the Gemara cited and 
Rav and Samuel equated the Amraphel of with the Nimrod whom describes as “a mighty warrior on the earth,” but the two differed over which was his real name. One held that his name was actually Nimrod, and calls him Amraphel because he ordered Abram to be cast into a burning furnace (and thus the name Amraphel reflects the words for “he said” ("amar") and “he cast” ("hipil")). But the other held that his name was actually Amraphel, and calls him Nimrod because he led the world in rebellion against God (and thus the name Nimrod reflects the word for “he led in rebellion” ("himrid")).
Rabbi Berekiah and Rabbi Helbo taught in the name of Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman that the Valley of Siddim (mentioned in in connection with the battle between the four kings and the five kings) was called the Valley of Shaveh (which means "as one") because there all the peoples of the world agreed as one, felled cedars, erected a large dais for Abraham, set him on top, and praised him, saying (in the words of "Hear us, my lord: You are a prince of God among us." They told Abraham that he was king over them and a god to them. But Abraham replied that the world did not lack its King, and the world did not lack its God.
A Midrash taught that there was not a mighty man in the world more difficult to overcome than Og, as says, “only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.” The Midrash told that Og had been the only survivor of the strong men whom Amraphel and his colleagues had slain, as may be inferred from which reports that Amraphel “smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim,” and one may read to indicate that Og lived near Ashteroth. The Midrash taught that Og was the refuse among the Rephaim, like a hard olive that escapes being mashed in the olive press. The Midrash inferred this from which reports that “there came one who had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew,” and the Midrash identified the man who had escaped as Og, as describes him as a remnant, saying, “only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim.” The Midrash taught that Og intended that Abram should go out and be killed. God rewarded Og for delivering the message by allowing him to live all the years from Abraham to Moses, but God collected Og’s debt to God for his evil intention toward Abraham by causing Og to fall by the hand of Abraham’s descendants. On coming to make war with Og, Moses was afraid, thinking that he was only 120 years old, while Og was more than 500 years old, and if Og had not possessed some merit, he would not have lived all those years. So God told Moses (in the words of ), “fear him not; for I have delivered him into your land,” implying that Moses should slay Og with his own hand.
Rabbi Abbahu said in Rabbi Eleazar’s name that “his trained men” in meant Torah scholars, and thus when Abram made them fight to rescue Lot, he brought punishment on himself and his children, who were consequently enslaved in Egyptian for 210 years. But Samuel said that Abram was punished because he questioned whether God would keep God’s promise, when in Abram asked God “how shall I know that I shall inherit it?” And Rabbi Johanan said that Abram was punished because he prevented people from entering beneath the wings of the Shekhinah and being saved, when in the king of Sodom said it to Abram, “Give me the persons, and take the goods yourself,” and Abram consented to leave the prisoners with the king of Sodom.
Rav interpreted the words “And he armed his trained servants, born in his own house” in to mean that Abram equipped them by teaching them the Torah. Samuel read the word "vayarek" (“he armed”) to mean “bright,” and thus interpreted the words “And he armed his trained servants” in to mean that Abram made them bright with gold, that is, rewarded them for accompanying him.
Reading the report in that Abram led 318 men, Rabbi Ammi bar Abba said that Abram’s servant Eliezer outweighed them all. The Gemara reported that others (employing gematria) said that Eliezer alone accompanied Abram to rescue Lot, as the Hebrew letters in Eliezer’s name have a numerical value of 318.
Midrash identified the Melchizedek of with Noah’s son Shem. The Rabbis taught that Melchizedek acted as a priest and handed down Adam’s robes to Abraham. Rabbi Zechariah said on Rabbi Ishmael’s authority (or others say, it was taught at the school of Rabbi Ishmael) that God intended to continue the priesthood from Shem’s descendants, as says, “And he (Melchizedek/Shem) was the priest of the most high God.” But then Melchizedek gave precedence in his blessing to Abram over God, and thus God decided to bring forth the priesthood from Abram. As reports, “And he (Melchizedek/Shem) blessed him (Abram), and said: ‘Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth; and blessed be God the Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand.’” Abram replied to Melchizedek/Shem by questioning whether the blessing of a servant should be given precedence over that of the master. And straightaway, God gave the priesthood to Abram, as says, “The Lord (God) said to my Lord (Abram), Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool,” which is followed in by, “The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, ‘You (Abram) are a priest for ever, after the order ("dibrati") of Melchizedek,’” meaning, “because of the word ("dibbur") of Melchizedek.” Hence says, “And he (Melchizedek/Shem) was the priest of the most high God,” implying that Melchizedek/Shem was a priest, but not his descendants.
Rabbi Isaac the Babylonian said that Melchizedek was born circumcised. A Midrash taught that Melchizedek called Jerusalem “Salem.” The Rabbis said that Melchizedek instructed Abraham in the Torah. Rabbi Eleazar said that Melchizedek’s school was one of three places where the Holy Spirit manifested itself.
Rabbi Judah said in Rabbi Nehorai's name that Melchizedek’s blessing yielded prosperity for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Ephraim Miksha'ah the disciple of Rabbi Meir said in the latter's name that Tamar descended from Melchizedek.
Rabbi Hana bar Bizna citing Rabbi Simeon Hasida (or others say Rabbi Berekiah in the name of Rabbi Isaac) identified Melchizedek as one of the four craftsmen of whom Zechariah wrote in The Gemara taught that David wrote the Book of Psalms, including in it the work of the elders, including Melchizedek in 
Genesis chapter 15.
The Gemara expounded on the words, “And He brought him outside,” in The Gemara taught that Abram had told God that Abram had employed astrology to see his destiny and had seen that he was not fated to have children. God replied that Abram should go “outside” of his astrological thinking, for the stars do not determine Israel’s fate.
The Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that Abraham inherited both this world and the World to Come as a reward for his faith, as says, “And he believed in the Lord.”
Resh Lakish taught that Providence punishes bodily those who unjustifiably suspect the innocent. In Moses said that the Israelites “will not believe me,” but God knew that the Israelites would believe. God thus told Moses that the Israelites were believers and descendants of believers, while Moses would ultimately disbelieve. The Gemara explained that reports that “the people believed” and reports that the Israelites’ ancestor Abram “believed in the Lord,” while reports that Moses “did not believe.” Thus, Moses was smitten when in God turned his hand white as snow.
Rabbi Jacob bar Aha said in the name of Rav Assi that Abraham asked God whether God would wipe out Abraham’s descendants as God had destroyed the generation of the Flood. Rabbi Jacob bar Aha said in the name of Rav Assi that Abraham’s question in “O Lord God, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?” was part of a larger dialogue. Abraham asked God if Abraham’s descendants should sin before God, would God do to them as God did to the generation of the Flood (in ) and the generation of the Dispersion (in Genesis in ). God told Abraham that God would not. Abraham then asked God (as reported in ), “Let me know how I shall inherit it.” God answered by instructing Abraham (as reported in ), “Take Me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old” (which Abraham was to sacrifice to God). Abraham acknowledged to God that this means of atonement through sacrifice would hold good while a sacrificial shrine remained in being, but Abraham pressed God what would become of his descendants when the Temple would no longer exist. God replied that God had already long ago provided for Abraham’s descendants in the Torah the order of the sacrifices, and whenever they read it, God would deem it as if they had offered them before God, and God would grant them pardon for all their iniquities. Rabbi Jacob bar Aha said in the name of Rav Assi that this demonstrated that were it not for the , "Ma'amadot", groups of lay Israelites who participated in worship as representatives of the public, then heaven and earth could not endure.
A Midrash noted the difference in wording between which says of the Israelites in Goshen that “they got possessions therein,” and which says of the Israelites in Canaan, “When you come into the land of Canaan, which I gave you for a possession.” The Midrash read to read, “and they were taken in possession by it.” The Midrash thus taught that in the case of Goshen, the land seized the Israelites, so that their bond might be exacted and so as to bring about God's declaration to Abraham in that the Egyptians would afflict the Israelites for 400 years. But the Midrash read to teach the Israelites that if they were worthy, the Land of Israel would be an eternal possession, but if not, they would be banished from it.
The Mishnah pointed to God’s announcement to Abram in that his descendants would return from Egyptian slavery to support the proposition that the merits of the father bring about benefits for future generations.
A Midrash taught that and call the Euphrates “the Great River” because it encompasses the Land of Israel. The Midrash noted that at the creation of the world, the Euphrates was not designated “great.” But it is called “great” because it encompasses the Land of Israel, which calls a “great nation.” As a popular saying said, the king’s servant is a king, and thus Scripture calls the Euphrates great because of its association with the great nation of Israel.
Genesis chapter 16.
Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai deduced from the words, “and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar,” in that Hagar was Pharaoh’s daughter. Rabbi Simeon taught that when Pharaoh saw what God did on Sarah’s behalf, Pharaoh gave his daughter to Sarai, reasoning that it would be better for his daughter to be a handmaid in Sarai’s house than a mistress in another house. Rabbi Simeon read the name “Hagar” in to mean “reward” ("agar"), imagining Pharaoh to say, “Here is your reward ("agar").”
A Midrash deduced from Sarai’s words in “Behold now, the Lord has restrained me from bearing; go into my handmaid; it may be that I shall be built up through her,” that one who is childless is as one who is demolished. The Rabbi of the Midrash reasoned that only that which is demolished must be “built up.”
A Midrash found in support for the proverb that if a person tells you that you have a donkey’s ears, do not believe it, but if two tell it to you, order a halter. For Abraham called Hagar Sarai’s servant the first time in saying, “Behold, your maid is in your hand.” And then the angel called Hagar Sarai’s servant the second time in saying, “Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid.” Thus, thereafter in Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai’s servant, saying, “I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.” Similarly, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari where Scripture supports the saying of the Rabbis that if your neighbor (justifiably) calls you a donkey, you should put a saddle on your back (and not quarrel to convince the neighbor otherwise). Rabbah bar Mari replied that the saying found support in where first the angel calls Hagar “Sarai's handmaid,” and then Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai’s servant, saying, “I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.”
Noting that the words “and an angel of the Lord said to her” occur three times in a Midrash asked how many angels visited Hagar. Rabbi Hama bar Rabbi Hanina said that five angels visited her, for each time the text mentions “speech,” it refers to an angel. The Rabbis said that four angels visited her, as the word “angel” occurs 4 times. Rabbi Hiyya taugh that Hagar’s encounter with the angels showed how great the difference was between the generations of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs and later generations. Rabbi Hiyya noted that after reports that Manoah and his wife, the parents of Samson, saw an angel, Manoah exclaimed to his wife in fear (in ), “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” Yet Hagar, a bondmaid, saw five angels and was not afraid. Rabbi Aha taught that a fingernail of the Patriarchs was more valuable than the abdomen of their descendants. Rabbi Isaac interpreted “She sees the ways of her household,” to apply homiletically to teach that all who lived in Abraham’s household were seers, so Hagar was accustomed to seeing angels.
Rabbi Simeon wept when he thought that Hagar, the handmaid of Rabbi Simeon’s ancestor Sarah, was found worthy of meeting an angel three times (including in ), while Rabbi Simeon did not meet an angel even once.
A Midrash counted in which the angel told Hagar, “Behold, you are with child . . . and you shall call his name Ishmael,” among four instances in which Scripture identifies a person’s name before birth. Rabbi Isaac also counted the cases of Isaac (in ), Solomon (in 1 Chronicles ), and Josiah (in ).
The Gemara taught that if one sees Ishmael in a dream, then God hears that person’s prayer (perhaps because the name “Ishmael” derives from “the Lord has heard” in or perhaps because “God heard” ("yishmah Elohim", ) Ishmael’s voice in ).
Genesis chapter 17.
Rabbi Judah contrasted God’s words to Abraham, "walk before Me," in with the words, "Noah walked with God," in Rabbi Judah compared it to a king who had two sons, one grown up and the other a child. The king asked the child to walk "with" him. But the king asked the adult to walk "before" him. Similarly, to Abraham, whose moral strength was great, God said, "Walk before Me." But of Noah, who was feeble, says, "Noah walked with God." Rabbi Nehemiah compared Noah to a king’s friend who was plunging about in dark alleys, and when the king saw him sinking in the mud, the king urged his friend to walk with him instead of plunging about. Abraham’s case, however, was compared to that of a king who was sinking in dark alleys, and when his friend saw him, the friend shined a light for him through the window. The king then asked his friend to come and shine a light before the king on his way. Thus, God told Abraham that instead of showing a light for God from Mesopotamia, he should come and show one before God in the Land of Israel. Similarly, says, “And he blessed Joseph, and said: The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk . . . .” Rabbi Berekiah in Rabbi Johanan’s name and Resh Lakish gave two illustrations of this. Rabbi Johanan said: It was as if a shepherd stood and watched his flocks. (Similarly, Abraham and Isaac walked before God and under Gods protection.) Resh Lakish said: It was as if a prince walked along while the elders preceded him (as an escort, to make known his coming). (Similarly, Abraham and Isaac walked before God, spreading word of God.) The Midrash taught that in Rabbi Johanan’s view: We need God’s proximity, while in Resh Lakish’s view, God needs us to glorify God (by propagating the knowledge of God’s greatness). Similarly, a Midrash read the words “Noah walked with God” in to mean that God supported Noah, so that Noah should not be overwhelmed by the evil behavior of the generation of the Flood. The Midrash compared this to a king whose son went on a mission for his father. The road ahead of him was sunken in mire, and the king supported him so that he would not sink in the mire. However, in the case of Abraham, God said in “walk before Me,” and regarding the Patriarchs, Jacob said in “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked.” For the Patriarchs would try to anticipate the Divine Presence, and would go ahead to do God’s will.
Rabbi taught that notwithstanding all the precepts that Abram fulfilled, God did not call him “perfect” until he circumcised himself, for in God told Abram, “Walk before me and be perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and you,” and in God explained that God’s covenant required that every male be circumcised.
Rav Judah said in Rav’s name that when God told Abram in “Walk before me and be perfect,” Abram was seized with trembling, thinking that perhaps there was some shameful flaw in him that needed correcting. But when God added in “And I will make My covenant between me and you,” God set Abram’s mind at ease.
Rabbi Hoshaiah taught that if one perfects oneself, then good fortune will follow, for says, “Walk before me and be perfect,” and shortly thereafter reports Abram’s reward for doing so: “And you shall be a father of many nations.”
Rabbi Ammi bar Abba employed gematria to interpret the meaning of Abram’s name change in from Abram () to Abraham (). According to Rabbi Ammi bar Abba, at first God gave Abram mastery over 243 of his body parts, as the numerical value of the Hebrew letters in Abram is 243. Then God gave Abraham mastery over 248 of his body parts, adding five body parts, as the numerical value of the Hebrew letter "hei" () that God added to his name is five. The Gemara explained that as a reward for Abraham’s undergoing circumcision, God granted Abraham control over his two eyes, his two ears, and the organ that he circumcised.
The Mishnah notes that transgressing the command of circumcision in is one of 36 transgressions that cause the transgressor to be cut off from his people.
The Gemara read the command of to require an uncircumcised adult man to become circumcised, and the Gemara read the command of to require the father to circumcise his infant child.
Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina taught that visiting those who have had medical procedures (as Abraham had in ) demonstrates one of God’s attributes that humans should emulate. Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina asked what means in the text, “You shall walk after the Lord your God.” How can a human being walk after God, when says, “Lord your God is a devouring fire”? Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina explained that the command to walk after God means to walk after the attributes of God. As God clothes the naked — for says, “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skin, and clothed them” — so should we also clothe the naked. God visited the sick — for says, “And the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre” (after Abraham was circumcised in ) — so should we also visit the sick. God comforted mourners — for says, “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son” — so should we also comfort mourners. God buried the dead — for says, “And He buried him in the valley” — so should we also bury the dead. Similarly, the Sifre on taught that to walk in God’s ways means to be (in the words of ) “merciful and gracious.”
Commandments.
According to Maimonides and Sefer ha-Chinuch, there is one positive commandment in the parashah:
The "Kitzur Shulchan Aruch" cites the words of “Fear not, Abram” (, "al-tirah Avram"), as an example of a verse where a missing letter , "yud", would cause one to have to take out another Torah scroll to read, as it would be a serious error in the scroll.
And the "Kitzur Shulchan Aruch" interprets God’s words to Abraham in “the father of a multitude of nations have I made you,” to mean that previously, Abram was father only to Aram, but from that point onward, he would be a father to all nations. Thus, the "Kitzur Shulchan Aruch" cites to support the proposition that a convert may be included in a group of three or more ("mezuman") for the purposes of the blessing after meals (, "Birkat Hamazon") and may say the blessing and the words of the blessing, “for giving our ancestors as a heritage.”
In the liturgy.
Some Jews refer to the ten trials of Abraham in as they study chapter 5 of "Pirkei Avot" on a Sabbath between Passover and Rosh Hashanah.
Jews refer to God’s selection of Abraham in God’s covenant with Abraham to give his descendants the Land in and and God’s changing of Abram’s name to Abraham in as they recite as part of the "Pesukei D’Zimrah" prayers during the daily morning (, "Shacharit") prayer service.
The Passover Haggadah, in the concluding "nirtzah" section of the Seder, in a reference to recounts how God granted victory to the righteous convert Abram at the middle of the night.
The name “Elyon” or “God Most High,” which Melchizedek used in is used in to refer to God, and is in turn recited after the "Lekhah Dodi" liturgical poem of the "Kabbalat Shabbat" prayer service.
The "Amidah" draws on God’s words in “Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to you,” to refer to God as “Shield of Abraham.”
In the hymn "Adon Olam" (“Lord of the World”), use of the title “Adon” recalls the merit of Abraham, who first addressed God with the title in 
The Haggadah, in the "magid" section of the Seder, quotes to demonstrate that God keeps God’s promises. Thereafter, the Haggadah reports that Israel “went down to Egypt — forced to do so by the word God,” and many commentators think that this statement refers to God’s foretelling in that Abram’s descendants would “be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them.” And in the concluding "nirtzah" section, in a reference to God’s promises to Abram in the Covenant Between the Pieces in the Haggadah reports that God “disclosed to the one from the Orient at midnight on Passover.”
Following the Kabbalat Shabbat service and prior to the Friday evening ("Ma'ariv") service, Jews traditionally read rabbinic sources on the observance of the Sabbath, including Mishnah Shabbat 18:3. Mishnah Shabbat 18:3, in turn, makes clear the precedence of the law of circumcision in over even the observance of the Sabbath.
The Weekly Maqam.
In the Weekly Maqam, Sephardi Jews each week base the songs of the services on the content of that week's parashah. For Parashah Lech Lecha, Sephardi Jews apply Maqam Saba, the maqam that symbolizes a covenant ("berit"). It is appropriate because in this parashah, Abraham and his sons undergo circumcisions, a ritual that signifies a covenant between man and God.
Haftarah.
The haftarah for the parashah is:

Wadi Salib riots

The Wadi Salib riots were a series of street demonstrations and acts of vandalism in the Wadi Salib neighborhood of Haifa, Israel, in 1959, sparked by the shooting of a Moroccan Jewish immigrant by police officers. Demonstrators accused the police of ethnic discrimination against Mizrahi Jews.
Background.
Wadi Salib was a pre-1948 Palestinian Arab neighborhood in a predominantly Jewish city. In 1948, the Palestinians were displaced by advancing IDF troops. Mizrahi Jewish immigrants were later placed in the empty houses by the state. The neighborhood quickly became a neglected, over-populated slum. At the same time, Polish immigrants were also looking to settle within Israel. As the Mizrahim were living in poor and cramped conditions, the Israeli government began granting comfortable housing to Polish immigrants. This obvious act of discrimination against the Mizrahim to the benefit of Ashkenazi immigrants was one of the main catalysts to the riot. This event was the initial recognition of an existing ethnic discrimination among Israeli Jews.
In general, the Mizrahim's protest against discrimination and mistreatment collided with the Ashkenazim elite stance that the Mizrahim and Ashkenazim are two distinct communities. At the same time, the Mizrahim were viewed as passive recipients of the Ashkenazi who actively and directly contributed to the creation of the Zionist vision of a Jewish-national community in Israel. 
More broadly, the riots of Wadi Salib were part of a larger movement organized by the Mizrahi Democratic Rainbow Coalition, or Hakeshet Hademocratit Hamizrahit, whose aims were to bring the Mizrahim justice.
History.
On July 9, 1959, police confronted a Wadi Salib resident, Yaakov Elkarif, who was drunk and disturbing the peace. When he began behaving wildly and hurling empty bottles at the policemen sent to arrest him, he was shot and seriously wounded. Residents surrounded the police vehicle and dragged an officer out of it. He was released only after shots were fired in the air. 
Conflicting testimonies arose from the event. One witness claimed Elkarif provoked the officer through threats. Another witness offered that Elkarif -the stereotypical Moroccan immigrant, known for being violent and hot-tempered- was shot for his lack of standing in society. Lastly, another witness claimed that the officer fired with the intention of calming the situation which resulted in Elkarif's accidental death. Despite rumors, Elkarif did not die from the gunshot wounds.
The next morning, several hundred Wadi Salib residents marched to Hadar HaCarmel, smashing shop windows and setting cars on fire. Back in Wadi Salib, the anger targeted the clubhouses of Mapai and the "Histadrut" (the Israeli congress of trade unions). The police tried to disperse the demonstrators by force, leaving 13 policemen and 2 demonstrators wounded. 34 demonstrators were arrested.
On July 11, riots broke out in other places in Israel, particularly in large communities of North African immigrants, like Tiberias, Beersheba and Migdal HaEmek. It was claimed the riots were not completely spontaneous, and that a local movement, Likud Yotsei Tsfon-Africa (Union of North-African Immigrants) was involved in planning some of them. David Ben-Haroush, one of the movement's founders, was sent to prison. Ben-Haroush participated in the following elections while in jail, running on the Union's list, though it failed to cross the electoral threshold. The riots were reported internationally, prompting the King of Morocco to express concern for the plight of Israel's North African immigrants.
The Wadi Salib riots still resonate in Israeli society as a symptom of the social malaise in the early years of the state that led to clashes between Mizrahi and Ashkenazi Jews. 
In 1979, Amos Gitai produced a film on the subject - "Me'oraot Wadi Salib". The Wadi Salib riots have been discussed in many scholarly articles

Bearwood, West Midlands

Bearwood is the southern part of Smethwick, in Sandwell, West Midlands, England, and north of the A456 Hagley Road, and the wider locality extending into North Edgbaston in Birmingham. Bearwood Hill was the original name of the High Street from Smethwick Council House to Windmill Lane. The border at the Shireland Brook where Portland Road (Edgbaston) becomes Shireland Road (Sandwell) is signed "Bearwood" (February 2014).
Bearwood is included in Abbey Ward in Sandwell Metropolitan Borough. In 1903, Bearwood Ward in Smethwick extended from Hagley Road to Smethwick High Street and included part of Cape Hill.
The Bearwood telephone exchange area marked out by the 0121-429 numbers extends as far east as Harborne Walkway.
Bearwood like many areas of the West Midlands conurbation has a local sense of place, although has become absorbed into Smethwick proper. Many locals still use the term "The Bear" especially referring to "The Bear Hotel" located in Bearwood. An old map of the 18th century mentions 'The Bear of Smithwick'.
General description.
Modern Bearwood centres around the Bearwood Road, and especially the crossroads with Sandon Road (to the east) and Three Shire Oak Road (to the west). Historically, Bearwood extended as far north as Smethwick High Street by Victoria Park east of the Council House. The 1899 Smethwick Borough surveyor's map of Smethwick shows Bearwood Ward as including Cheshire Road from its junction immediately opposite the Council House. Bearwood Hill is the old name for the High Street south of Victoria Park. The approach to Cape Hill from Birmingham via Portland Road still (March 2014) has a sign saying Bearwood.
Bearwood has a series of shopping parades along Bearwood Road, including a small indoor market, and a number of other local amenities such as banks, supermarkets, bakeries and pharmacies. There are several opticians and a large NHS dental practice situated on this road. The Birmingham Outer Circle bus routes (the 11A and the 11C), which link Birmingham's suburbs, have stops here. Bearwood also has a number of restaurants serving a range of different cuisines.
Bearwood Road leads northwards to Smethwick High Street, and at the southern end joins Hagley Road, one of the main arterial routes into Birmingham from the M5 at Junction 3. If the plans for the Midlands Metro extension along the Hagley Road are realised, Bearwood will also have a tram stop.
Between 1923 and 1973, Bearwood was the headquarters of the Birmingham & Midland Motor Omnibus Company - or "Midland Red" - based at the company's depot in Bearwood Road. Although most of the company's innovative buses were built at its Carlyle Road workshops in nearby Edgbaston, they were all registered at Bearwood and as such carried the Smethwick 'HA' prefix on their number plates.
History.
Maps of the Bearwood area up to the mid 19th century show the area as being rural, with farms, mansions such as Lightwoods House, and two small hamlets near the main crossroads. Bearwood Road was an important route linking the growing industrial area of Smethwick with Harborne, Selly Oak and King's Norton, with crossroads at Sandon Road (site of The Bear Tavern) and Hagley Road (site of The King's Head). From about 1880, there was quite rapid growth with a mixture of "ribbon development" and planned streets. This development ignored the county boundaries, and covered the Staffordshire central section along Bearwood Road, and spread into Warwickshire (eastwards), Shropshire (north-westwards) and Worcestershire (south-westwards). By 1903, the entire area of Bearwood between Barnsley Road and Wigorn Road, north of Adkins Lane, and as far north as Rawlings Road (marked by the Baptist Chapel) had been developed in an orderly manner.
Also by 1903, most of the norther section of Bearwood Ward had also been developed. The north-east part included the M&B Brewery, and a substantial housing estate for the brewery workers. In 1903, Beakes Farm retained open country from Rawlings Road to Waterloo Road. The older terraces in Willow Avenue, Poplar Avenue and Dorset Road has also been built.
The early 20th century before World War 1 was marked by a number of ornate landmark buildings. One example is the 1908 structure opposite The Bear Tavern on the corner of Sandon Road and Bearwood Road. Built in 1907 for the Cooperative Society, this imposing building with terra cotta ornaments is now divided into a number of separate shops.
The Merrivale Road housing estate south of Hadley Stadium was built from 1905 to 1908.
Some of the Birmingham conurbation's older properties can be found in the roads adjoining Bearwood Road. A traditionally upper working class area of Victorian terraced houses, this has more recently become much sought after, as house prices in neighbouring areas such as Harborne have moved out of the range of first time buyers.
Commerce and industry.
Until the main era of house building in the 20th century, the main industry was agriculture. By 1903, Beakes Farm between Rawlings Road and Hadley Stadium was the last farm. Bearwood has had very little manufacturing industry, the most important being the William Mitchell Pens factory at the northern end of Bearwood Road.
The main commercial activity is shops and other service sector businesses.
Landmarks.
For completeness, landmarks up to the 1899 Bearwood Ward boundary, and those associated with the Bearwood area, both on the Birmingham side of the border, and west of Thimblemill Brook, may be included.
Northern.
This section is now thought of as Cape Hill rather than Bearwood, but it was in the original Bearwood Ward of Smethwick Borough Council as surveyed in 1889.
Central.
For convenience, this is taken as the area south of the junction of Waterloo Road and Bearwood Road, to the north side of the junction of Bearwood Road with Sandon Road and Three Shire Oak Road.
Birmingham side.
Sandon Road has two church buildings which are locally associated with Bearwood.
West of Thimblemill.
Abbey Infant and Junior schools, on the peak of Abbey Road by Warley Woods serves the Bearwood area.
Transport.
Bearwood is well served by major bus routes, with the Bearwood Interchange at the crossroads of the Hagley Road and Bearwood Road. Some other bus routes cross the Bearwood Road by "The Bear".
Parks.
Lightwoods Park is located to the west of Bearwood, on the north side of Hagley Road. It consists of Lightwoods House and grounds. In 1902, following the death of Caleb Adkins, the house and grounds were put up for sale, with the risk that it would be demolished for building houses on the estate. A. M. Chance led a committee which by public subscription purchased the estate and handed it over to Birmingham Corporation as a public park. By 1905, further public subscriptions enabled more land to be bought and added to the park.
The bandstand and other features have the Birmingham City crest with the motto, "Birmingham Forward" in recognition of the ownership of the park by Birmingham City Corporation.
The most recent tenant of Lightwoods House was the Hardman company, which makes stained glass windows. In November 2010, by agreement between the two Councils, Lightwoods Park was handed over to Sandwell MBC.
Features include a skateboard ramp and bowling green. "The Shakespeare Garden", a walled garden alongside the house, was planted with every identifiable plant in Shakespeare's plays. The bandstand (a Grade II listed building ). A drinking fountain also has City of Birmingham inscriptions. The historic Lightwoods House, a Grade II listed building is now undergoing extensive renovation.
Also on 14 September 2012 it was host to a Drive-in movie for the viewing of Grease one of the first Drive-In movie's in the United Kingdom for many years.
Warley Park, colloquially called "Warley Woods", is nearby. It is grade II listed on the English Heritage Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. It covers and includes a meadow, woodland and a public golf course.
Every year Warley Woods hosts a music festival entitled "Picnic In The Park" - to promote local bands & artists and to raise funds to maintain the parkland.
Schools.
Secondary.
At the northern end of the Bearwood area is Shireland Collegiate Academy, on Waterloo Road.
On the southern border, in Harborne, Lordswood Boys School and Lordswood Girls School take a substantial number of students from the Bearwood area.
Places of worship.
The local Church of England parish church is St Mary's, which stands at the junction of Bearwood Road and St Mary's Road. The parish was originally part of the parish of St Peter's, Harborne.
There is a Roman Catholic church (Our Lady and St Gregory's) on Three Shires Oak Road.
The Methodist Church is now in the former Church of Christ Scientist on the junction of Sandon Road and Poplar Avenue.
The original Wesleyan Methodist Church building on the corner of Sandon Road and Barnsley Road is now used by the Redeemed Christian Church of God.
Local entertainment.
Bearwood has a small range of local restaurants:
Azzari Too,
Martin's Restaurant,
The King's Arms,
Purnima (formerly Teknaf Cuisine)
Local pub The Bear Tavern (The Bear Hotel) hosted comedy nights in the 1980s hosted by local comedian Frank Skinner (Chris Collins) and many TV comedians appeared there, including Sean Hughes, Ed Byrne and some of TV's "The Fast Show". It now stages a monthly clubnight, Club Mojo, and hosts an annual charity Music festival entitled Bearwoodstock.
Bearwood's main musical claim to fame lies with Christine Perfect, who grew up in Bearwood and studied sculpture at art college in Birmingham. She joined Fleetwood Mac and married John McVie in 1970 and, as Christine McVie, went on to become one of the outstanding members in the band's long and illustrious career. Keith Law member of the bands, Velvett Fogg and 'Jardine', lived in Park Road, Bearwood, in the mid-1980s. Other musical claims to fame include the now defunct "Little Nibble" cafe getting a mention on Dexy's Midnight Runners "Don't Stand Me Down" album and local -ish band The Twang rehearsing at the Sandwell Snooker Centre in the town. Award-winning actress Julie Walters lived in Bishopton Road as a child.
There are many local musicians in the area and until recently there were regular acoustic performances at Atticus Bar, which closed its doors in November 2008. Until his death in 2012 saxophonist Andy Hamilton performed weekly gigs along with his sons and Blue Notes band at the Corks Club on Bearwood High Street.
In 2011 a group of local people began to stage free music events at the bandstand in Lightwoods Park, these events are known as the Bearwood Shuffle and have attracted large crowds with an eclectic mix of local acts both established and unsigned.

Vayeira

Vayeira, Vayera, or ( — Hebrew for "and He appeared,” the first word in the parashah) is the fourth weekly Torah portion (, "parashah") in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading. It constitutes The parashah has the most words (but not the most letters or verses) of any of the weekly Torah portions in the book of Genesis, and is made up of 7,862 Hebrew letters, 2,085 Hebrew words, and 147 verses, and can occupy about 252 lines in a Torah Scroll (, "Sefer Torah"). (In the book of Genesis, Parashah Miketz has the most letters, and Parashiyot Noach and Vayishlach have the most verses.)
Jews read it on the fourth Sabbath after Simchat Torah, generally in October or November. Jews also read parts of the parashah as Torah readings for Rosh Hashanah. is the Torah reading for the first day of Rosh Hashanah, and is the Torah reading for the second day of Rosh Hashanah. In Reform Judaism, is the Torah reading for the one day of Rosh Hashanah.
The parashah tells the stories of Abraham’s three visitors and Abraham’s bargaining with God over Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot’s two visitors and Lot’s bargaining with the Sodomites, the flight of Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, how Abraham once again passed off his wife Sarah as his sister, the birth of Isaac, the expulsion of Hagar, disputes over wells, and the binding of Isaac.
Readings.
In traditional Sabbath Torah reading, the parashah is divided into seven readings, or , "aliyot". In the Masoretic Text of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Parashah Vayeira has four "open portion" (, "petuchah") divisions (roughly equivalent to paragraphs, often abbreviated with the Hebrew letter ("peh")). Parashah Vayeira has two further subdivisions, called "closed portion" (, "setumah") divisions (abbreviated with the Hebrew letter ("samekh")) within the first open portion (, "petuchah"). The first open portion (, "petuchah") spans the first five readings (, "aliyot"). The second open portion (, "petuchah") coincides with the sixth reading (, "aliyah"). The third open portion (, "petuchah") covers the binding of Isaac, which is most of the seventh reading (, "aliyah"), excluding only the concluding "maftir" () reading. And the fourth open portion (, "petuchah") coincides with the concluding "maftir" () reading. Closed portion (, "setumah") divisions further divide the long fourth reading (, "aliyah").
First reading — Genesis 18:1–14.
In the first reading (, "aliyah"), as Abraham was sitting at the entrance of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre at the heat of the day, he looked up and saw God in the form of three men, and he ran, bowed to the ground, and welcomed them. Abraham offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, and they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah’s tent to order cakes made from choice flour, ran to select a choice calf for a servant-boy to prepare, set curds and milk and the calf before them, and waited on them under the tree as they ate. One of the visitors told Abraham that he would return the next year, and Sarah would have a son, but Sarah laughed to herself at the prospect, with Abraham so old. God then questioned Abraham why Sarah had laughed at bearing a child at her age, noting that nothing was too wondrous for God. The first reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Second reading — Genesis 18:15–33.
In the second reading (, "aliyah"), frightened, Sarah denied laughing, but God insisted that she had. The men set out toward Sodom and Abraham walked with them to see them off. God considered whether to confide in Abraham what God was about to do, since God had singled out Abraham to become a great nation and instruct his posterity to keep God’s way by doing what was just and right. God told Abraham that the outrage and sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was so great that God was going to see whether they had acted according to the outcry that had reached God. The men went on to Sodom, while Abraham remained standing before God. Abraham pressed God whether God would sweep away the innocent along with the guilty, asking successively if there were 50, or 45, or 40, or 30, or 20, or 10 innocent people in Sodom, would God not spare the city for the sake of the innocent ones, and each time God agreed to do so. When God had finished speaking to Abraham, God departed, and Abraham returned to his place. The second reading (, "aliyah") ends here with the end of chapter 
Third reading — Genesis 19:1–20.
In the third reading (, "aliyah"), in chapter as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom in the evening, the two angels arrived, and Lot greeted them and bowed low to the ground. Lot invited the angels to spend the night at his house and bathe their feet, but they said that they would spend the night in the square. Lot urged them strongly, so they went to his house, and he prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. Before they had retired for the night, all the men of Sodom gathered about the house shouting to Lot to bring his visitors out so that they might be intimate with them. Lot went outside the entrance, shutting the door behind him, and begged the men of Sodom not commit such a wrong. Lot offered the men his two virgin daughters for them to do with as they pleased, if they would not do anything to his guests, but they disparaged Lot as one who had come as an alien and now sought to rule them, and they pressed threateningly against him and the door. But the visitors stretched out their hands and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door and struck the people with blindness so that they were unable to find the entrance. The visitors directed Lot to bring what family he had out of the city, for they were about to destroy the place, because the outcry against its inhabitants had become so great. So Lot told his sons-in-law that they needed to get out of the place because God was about to destroy it, but Lot’s sons-in-law thought that he was joking. As dawn broke, the angels urged Lot to flee with his wife and two remaining daughters, but still he delayed. So out of God’s mercy, the men seized Lot, his wife, and daughters by the hand and brought them out of the city, telling them to flee for their lives and not to stop or look back anywhere in the plain. But Lot asked them whether he might flee to a little village nearby. The third reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Fourth reading — Genesis 19:21–21:4.
In the long fourth reading (, "aliyah"), the angel replied that he would grant Lot this favor too, and spare that town. The angel urged Lot to hurry there, for the angel could not do anything until he arrived there, and thus the town came to be called Zoar. As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar, God rained sulfurous fire from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah and annihilated the entire plain. Lot’s wife looked back, and she turned into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before God and looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw the smoke rising like at a kiln. Lot was afraid to dwell in Zoar, so he settled in a cave in the hill country with his two daughters. The older daughter told the younger that their father was old, and there was not a man on earth with whom to have children, so she proposed that they get Lot drunk and have sex with him so that they might maintain life through their father. That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one lay with her father without his being aware. And the next day the older one persuaded the younger to do the same. The two daughters thus had children by their father, the older one bore a son named Moab who became the father of the Moabites, and the younger bore a son named Ben-ammi who became the father of the Ammonites. A closed portion (, "setumah") ends here with the end of chapter 
As the reading continues in chapter Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was sojourning in Gerar, Abraham said that Sarah was his sister, so King Abimelech had her brought to him, but God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him that taking her would cause him to die, for she was a married woman. Abimelech had not approached her, so he asked God whether God would slay an innocent, as Abraham and Sarah had told him that they were brother and sister. God told Abimelech in the dream that God knew that Abimelech had a blameless heart, and so God had kept him from touching her. God told Abimelech to restore Abraham’s wife, since he was a prophet, and he would intercede for Abimelech to save his life, which he and his household would lose if he failed to restore her. Early next morning, Abimelech told his servants what had happened, asked Abraham what he had done and why he had brought so great a guilt upon Abimelech and his kingdom. Abraham replied that he had thought that Gerar had no fear of God and would kill him because of his wife, and that she was in fact his father’s daughter though not his mother’s, so he had asked of her the kindness of identifying him as her brother. Abimelech restored Sarah to Abraham, gave him sheep, oxen, and slaves, and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelech’s lands. And Abimelech told Sarah that he was giving Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve her as vindication before all. Abraham then prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and the women in his household, so that they bore children, for God had stricken the women with infertility because of Sarah. Another closed portion (, "setumah") ends here with the end of chapter 
As the reading continues in chapter God took note of Sarah, and she bore Abraham a son as God had predicted, and Abraham named him Isaac. Abraham circumcised Isaac when he was eight days old. The fourth reading (, "aliyah") ends here.
Fifth reading — Genesis 21:5–21.
In the fifth reading (, "aliyah"), Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born, and Sarah remarked that God had brought her laughter and everyone would laugh with her about her bearing Abraham a child in his old age. Abraham held a great feast on the day that Sarah weaned Isaac. Sarah saw Hagar's son Ishmael playing, and Sarah told Abraham to cast Hagar and Ishmael out, saying that Ishmael would not share in Abraham’s inheritance with Isaac. Sarah’s words greatly distressed Abraham, but God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do whatever Sarah told him, for Isaac would carry on Abraham’s line, and God would make a nation of Ishmael, too. Early the next morning, Abraham placed some bread and water on Hagar’s shoulder, together with Ishmael, and sent them away. Hagar and Ishmael wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba, and when the water ran out, she left the child under a bush, sat down about two bowshots away so as not to see the child die, and burst into tears. God heard the cry of the boy, and an angel called to Hagar, saying not to fear, for God had heeded the boy’s cry, and would make of him a great nation. Then God opened her eyes to a well of water, and she and the boy drank. God was with Ishmael and he grew up in the wilderness and became a bowman. Ishmael lived in the wilderness of Paran, and Hagar got him an Egyptian wife. The fifth reading (, "aliyah") and the first open portion (, "petuchah") end here.
Sixth reading — Genesis 21:22–34.
In the sixth reading (, "aliyah"), Abimelech and Phicol the chief of his troops asked Abraham to swear not to deal falsely with them. Abraham reproached Abimelech because Abimelech’s servants had seized Abraham’s well, but Abimelech protested ignorance. Abraham gave Abimelech sheep and oxen and two men made a pact. Abraham then offered Abimelech seven ewes as proof that Abraham had dug the well. They called the place Beersheba, for the two of them swore an oath there. After they concluded their pact, Abimelech and Phicol returned to Philistia, and Abraham planted a tamarisk and invoked God’s name. Abraham lived in Philistia a long time. The sixth reading (, "aliyah") and the second open portion (, "petuchah") end here with the end of chapter 
Seventh reading — Genesis chapter 22.
In the seventh reading (, "aliyah"), which coincides with chapter sometime later, God tested Abraham, directing him to take Isaac to the land of Moriah and offer him there as a burnt offering. Early the next morning, Abraham saddled his donkey and split wood for the burnt offering, and then he, two of his servants, and Isaac set out for the place that God had named. On the third day, Abraham saw the place from afar, and directed his servants to wait with the donkey, while Isaac and he went up to worship and then return. Abraham took the firestone and the knife, put the wood on Isaac, and the two walked off together. When Isaac asked Abraham where the sheep was for the burnt offering, Abraham replied that God would see to the sheep for the burnt offering. They arrived at the place that God had named, and Abraham built an altar, laid out the wood, bound Isaac, laid him on the altar, and picked up the knife to slay him. Then an angel called to Abraham, telling him not to raise his hand against the boy, for now God knew that Abraham feared God, since he had not withheld his son. Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught in a thicket by its horns, so he offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. Abraham named the site Adonai-yireh. The angel called to Abraham a second time, saying that because Abraham had not withheld his son, God would bless him and make his descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sands on the seashore, and victorious over their foes. All the nations of the earth would bless themselves by Abraham’s descendants, because he obeyed God’s command. Abraham returned to his servants, and they departed for Beersheba; where Abraham stayed. The third open portion (, "petuchah") ends here.
As the seventh reading (, "aliyah") continues with the "maftir" () reading that concludes the parashah, later, Abraham learned that Milcah had borne eight children to his brother Nahor, among whom was Bethuel, who became the father of Rebekah. Nahor’s concubine Reumah also bore him four children. The seventh reading (, "aliyah"), the fourth open portion (, "petuchah"), chapter and the parashah end here.

The parashah has parallels or is discussed in these early nonrabbinic sources:
Genesis chapter 19.
Josephus taught that Lot entreated the angels to accept lodging with him because he had learned to be a generous and hospitable man by imitating Abraham.
The Wisdom of Solomon held that Wisdom delivered the “righteous” Lot, who fled from the wicked who perished when the fire came down on the five cities.
In classical Rabbinic interpretation.
The parashah is discussed in these rabbinic sources from the era of the Mishnah and the Talmud:
Genesis chapter 18.
The Mishnah taught that Abraham suffered ten trials (several in this parashah) and withstood them all, demonstrating how great Abraham’s love of God was. And the Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael taught that Abraham inherited both this world and the World-to-Come as a reward for his faith, as says, “And he believed in the Lord.”
Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina taught that visiting the infirm (as God did in ) demonstrates one of God’s attributes that humans should emulate. Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina asked what means in the text, “You shall walk after the Lord your God.” How can a human being walk after God, when says, “Lord your God is a devouring fire”? Rabbi Hama son of Rabbi Hanina explained that the command to walk after God means to walk after the attributes of God. As God clothes the naked — for says, “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skin, and clothed them” — so should we also clothe the naked. God visited the sick — for says, “And the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre” (after Abraham was circumcised in ) — so should we also visit the sick. God comforted mourners — for says, “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son” — so should we also comfort mourners. God buried the dead — for says, “And He buried him in the valley” — so should we also bury the dead. Similarly, the Sifre on taught that to walk in God’s ways means to be (in the words of ) “merciful and gracious.”
Rabbi Leazar ben Menahem taught that the opening words of “And the Lord appeared,” indicated God’s proximity to Abraham. Rabbi Leazar taught that the words of “The Lord is far from the wicked,” refer to the prophets of other nations. But the continuation of “He hears the prayer of the righteous,” refers to the prophets of Israel. God appears to nations other that Israel only as one who comes from a distance, as says, “They came from a far country to me.” But in connection with the prophets of Israel, says, “And the Lord appeared,” and says, “And the Lord called,” implying from the immediate vicinity. Rabbi Haninah compared the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of other nations to a king who was with his friend in a chamber (separated by a curtain). Whenever the king desired to speak to his friend, he folded up the curtain and spoke to him. (But God speaks to the prophets of other nations without folding back the curtain.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who has a wife and a concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he repairs with stealth. Similarly, God appears to non-Jews only at night, as says, “And God came to Balaam at night,” and says, “And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night.”
A Midrash interpreted the words of "And when after my skin thus is destroyed (, "nikkefu"), then through my flesh shall I see God," to allude to Abraham. According to the Midrash, Abraham reasoned that after he circumcised himself, many proselytes flocked ("hikkif") to attach themselves to the covenant, and it was thus because Abraham did so that God revealed God's Self to Abraham, as reports, "And the Lord appeared to him." (And thus through circumcision performed on his flesh did Abraham come to see God.)
Rabbi Isaac taught that God reasoned that if God said in "An altar of earth you shall make to Me then I will come to you and bless you," thus revealing God's Self to bless him who built an altar in God's name, then how much more should God reveal God's Self to Abraham, who circumcised himself for God's sake. And thus, "the Lord appear to him."
A Midrash interpreted the words of Psalm "Your condescension has made me great," to allude to Abraham. For God made Abraham great by allowing Abraham to sit (on account of his age and weakness after his circumcision) while the Shekhinah stood, as reports, "And the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door."
A Baraita taught that in “in the heat of the day” meant the sixth hour, or exactly midday.
Rav Judah said in Rav’s name that showed that hospitality to wayfarers is greater than welcoming the Divine Presence. Rav Judah read the words “And he said, ‘My Lord, if now I have found favor in Your sight, pass not away’” in to reflect Abraham’s request of God to wait for Abraham while Abraham saw to his guests. And Rabbi Eleazar said that God’s acceptance of this request demonstrated how God’s conduct is not like that of mortals, for among mortals, an inferior person cannot ask a greater person to wait, while in God allowed it.
The Tosefta taught that God rewarded measure for measure Abraham’s good deeds of hospitality in with benefits for Abraham’s descendants the Israelites.
The Gemara identified the “three men” in as the angels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Michael came to tell Sarah of Isaac’s birth, Raphael came to heal Abraham, and Gabriel came to destroy Sodom. Noting that reports that “the two angels came to Sodom,” the Gemara explained that Michael accompanied Gabriel to rescue Lot. The Gemara cited the use of the singular “He” in where it says, “"He" overthrew those cities,” instead of “"they" overthrew” to demonstrate that a single angel (Gabriel) destroyed the cities.
In the heart is refreshed. A Midrash catalogued the wide range of additional capabilities of the heart reported in the Hebrew Bible. The heart speaks, sees, hears, walks, falls, stands, rejoices, cries, is comforted, is troubled, becomes hardened, grows faint, grieves, fears, can be broken, becomes proud, rebels, invents, cavils, overflows, devises, desires, goes astray, lusts, can be stolen, is humbled, is enticed, errs, trembles, is awakened, loves, hates, envies, is searched, is rent, meditates, is like a fire, is like a stone, turns in repentance, becomes hot, dies, melts, takes in words, is susceptible to fear, gives thanks, covets, becomes hard, makes merry, acts deceitfully, speaks from out of itself, loves bribes, writes words, plans, receives commandments, acts with pride, makes arrangements, and aggrandizes itself.
The Gemara reported that sages in the Land of Israel (and some said Rabbi Isaac) deduced from Sarah’s practice as shown in that while it was customary for a man to meet wayfarers, it was not customary for a woman to do so. And the Gemara cited this deduction to support the ruling of Mishnah Yevamot 8:3 that while a male Ammonite or Moabite was forbidden from entering the congregation of Israel, an Ammonite or Moabite woman was permitted.
At the School of Rabbi Ishmael, it was taught that demonstrated how great is the cause of peace, for Sarah said of Abraham in “My lord being old,” but when God reported Sarah’s statement to Abraham, God reported Sarah to have said, “And I [Sarah am old,” so as to preserve peace between Abraham and Sarah.
Reading “set time” in to mean the next “holy day” (as in ) the Gemara deduced that God spoke to Abraham on Sukkot to promise that Isaac would be born on Passover, and that there must have been a leap year that year, as those deductions allow the maximum 7 months between any two holy days.
Ravina asked one of the Rabbis who expounded Aggadah before him for the origin of the Rabbinic saying, “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing.” The Rabbi replied that says, “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing.” Ravina asked from where in the Torah one might derive that teaching. The Rabbi answered that says, “Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing?” And right after that mention of Abraham’s name, God blessed Abraham in saying, “Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation.”
Rabbi Eleazar interpreted the words, “"All" the nations of the earth,” in to teach that even those who spend their time on the ships that go from Gaul to Spain (and thus spend very little time on the dry earth) are blessed only for Israel’s sake.
The Gemara taught that sets forth one of the three most distinguishing virtues of the Jewish People. The Gemara taught that David told the Gibeonites that the Israelites are distinguished by three characteristics: They are merciful, bashful, and benevolent. They are merciful, for says that God would “show you (the Israelites) mercy, and have compassion upon you, and multiply you.” They are bashful, for (20:17 in NJPS) says “that God’s fear may be before you (the Israelites).” And they are benevolent, for says of Abraham “that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice.” The Gemara taught that David told the Gibeonites that only one who cultivates these three characteristics is fit to join the Jewish People.
Rabbi Eleazar taught that from the blessing of the righteous one may infer a curse for the wicked. The Gemara explained that one may see the principle at play in the juxtaposition of and For speaks of the blessing of the righteous Abraham, saying, “For I have known him, to the end that he may command.” And soon thereafter speaks of the curse of the wicked people of Sodom and Gomorrah, saying, “Truly the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great.”
The Mishnah taught that some viewed the people of Sodom as embracing a philosophy of “what’s mine is mine.” The Mishnah taught that there are four types of people: (1) One who says: “What’s mine is mine, and what’s yours is yours”; this is a neutral type, some say this was the type of Sodom. (2) One who says: “What’s mine is yours, and what’s yours is mine”; this is an unlearned person. (3) One who says: “What’s mine is yours, and what’s yours is yours”; this is a pious person. And (4) one who says: “What’s mine is mine, and what’s yours is mine;” this is a wicked person.
The Tosefta employed verses from the book of Job to teach that the people of Sodom acted arrogantly before God because of the good that God had lavished on them. As says, “As for the land, out of it comes bread . . . . Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold. That path, no bird of prey knows . . . . The proud beasts have not trodden it.” The people of Sodom reasoned that since bread, silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls came forth from their land, they did not need immigrants to come to Sodom. They reasoned that immigrants came only to take things away from Sodom and thus resolved to forget the traditional ways of hospitality. God told the people of Sodom that because of the goodness that God had lavished upon them, they had deliberately forgotten how things were customarily done in the world, and thus God would make them be forgotten from the world. As says, “They open shafts in a valley from where men live. They are forgotten by travelers. They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.” As says, “In the thought of one who is at ease, there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for those whose feet slip. The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their
Hand.” And so as says, “As I live, says the Lord God, Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you and your daughters have done. Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, plenty of bread, and careless ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it.”
Rava interpreted the words of “How long will you imagine mischief against a man? You shall be slain all of you; you are all as a bowing wall, and as a tottering fence.” Rava interpreted this to teach that the people of Sodom would cast envious eyes on the wealthy, place them by a tottering wall, push the wall down on them, and take their wealth. Rava interpreted the words of “In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime; they know not the light.” Rava interpreted this to teach that they used to cast envious eyes on wealthy people and entrust fragrant balsam into their keeping, which they placed in their storerooms. In the evening the people of Sodom would smell it out like dogs, as says, “They return at evening, they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.” Then they would burrow in and steal the money.
The Gemara told of the victims of the people of Sodom, in the words of “They (would) lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.” The Gemara said of the people of Sodom, in the words of “They drive away the donkey of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.” In the words of “They remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed them.” And the Gemara told of their victims, in the words of “he shall be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.”
The Gemara told that there were four judges in Sodom, named Shakrai, Shakurai, Zayyafi, and Mazle Dina (meaning “Liar,” “Awful Liar,” “Forger,” and “Perverter of Justice”). If a man assaulted his neighbor’s wife and caused a miscarriage, the judges would tell the husband to give his wife to the neighbor so that the neighbor might make her pregnant. If a person cut off the ear of a neighbor’s donkey, they would order the owner to give it to the offender until the ear grew again. If a person wounded a neighbor, they would tell the victim to pay the offender a fee for bleeding the victim. A person who crossed over with the ferry had to pay four zuzim, but the person who crossed through the water had to pay eight.
Explaining the words, “the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great ("rabbah", ),” in the Gemara told the story of a certain maiden ("ribah") in Sodom who gave some bread to a poor man, hiding it in a pitcher. When the people of Sodom found out about her generosity, they punished her by smearing her with honey and placing her on the city wall, where the bees consumed her. Rav Judah thus taught in Rav's name that indicates that God destroyed Sodom on account of the maiden ("ribah").
Rabbi Judah explained the words of "her cry that has come to Me." Noting that does not say "their cry" but "her cry," Rabbi Judah told that the people of Sodom issued a proclamation that anyone who gave a loaf of bread to the poor or needy would be burned. Lot's daughter Pelotit, the wife of a magnate of Sodom, saw a poor man on the street, and was moved with compassion. Every day when she went out to draw water, she smuggled all kinds of provisions to him from her house in her pitcher. The men of Sodom questioned how the poor man could survive. When they found out, they brought Pelotit out to be burned. She cried out to God to maintain her cause, and her cry ascended before the Throne of Glory. And God said (in the words of ) "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to her cry that has come to Me." 
Reading Abraham’s request in “What if ten shall be found there?” a Midrash asked, why ten (and not fewer)? The Midrash answered, so that there might be enough for a minyan of righteous people to pray on behalf of all of the people of Sodom. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because at the generation of the Flood, eight righteous people remained (in Noah and his family) and God did not give the world respite for their sake. Alternatively, the Midrash said, because Lot thought that there were ten righteous people in Sodom — namely Lot, his wife, his four daughters, and his four sons-in-law (but Lot was apparently mistaken in thinking them righteous). Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon and Rabbi Hanin in Rabbi Johanan’s name said that ten were required for Sodom, but for Jerusalem even one would have sufficed, as says, “Run to and fro in the streets of Jerusalem . . . and seek . . . if you can find a man, if there be any who does justly . . . and I will pardon her.” And thus says, “Adding one thing to another, to find out the account.” Rabbi Isaac explained that an account can be extended as far as one man for one city. And thus if one righteous person can be found in a city, it can be saved in the merit of that righteous person.
Did Abraham’s prayer to God in change God’s harsh decree? Could it have? On this subject, Rabbi Abbahu interpreted David’s last words, as reported in where David reported that God told him, “Ruler over man shall be the righteous, even he that rules through the fear of God.” Rabbi Abbahu read to teach that God rules humankind, but the righteous rule God, for God makes a decree, and the righteous may through their prayer annul it.
Genesis chapter 19.
The Rabbis in a Midrash asked why the angels took so long to travel from Abraham’s camp to Sodom, leaving Abraham at noon and arriving in Sodom only (as reports) “in the evening.” The Midrash explained that they were angels of mercy, and thus they delayed, thinking that perhaps Abraham might find something to change Sodom’s fate, but when Abraham found nothing, as reports, “the two angels came to Sodom in the evening.”
A Midrash noted that in the visitors are called “angels,” whereas in they were called “men.” The Midrash explained that earlier, when the Shechinah (the Divine Presence) was above them, Scripture called them men, but as soon as the Shechinah departed from them, they assumed the form of angels. Rabbi Levi (or others say Rabbi Tanhuma in the name of Rabbi Levi) said that to Abraham, whose spiritual strength was great, they looked like men (as Abraham was as familiar with angels as with men). But to Lot, whose spiritual strength was weak, they appeared as angels. Rabbi Hanina taught that before they performed their mission, they were called “men.” But having performed their mission, they are referred to as “angels.” Rabbi Tanhuma compared them to a person who received a governorship from the king. Before reaching the seat of authority, the person goes about like an ordinary citizen. Similarly, before they performed their mission, Scripture calls them “men,” but having performed their mission, Scripture calls them “angels.” 
A Midrash expounded on the conversation between Lot and the angels. Expanding on the words, “but before they lay down” in the Midrash told that the angels began questioning Lot, inquiring into the nature of the people of the city. Lot replied that in every town there are good people and bad people, but in Sodom the overwhelming majority were bad. Then (in the words of ) “the men of the city, the men of sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old,” not one of them objecting. And then (in the words of ) “they called to Lot, and said to him: ‘Where are the men that came to you this night? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.’” Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said in the name of Rabbi Padiah that Lot prayed for mercy on the Sodomites’ behalf the whole night, and the angels would have heeded him. But when the Sodomites demanded (in the words of ) “Bring them out to us, that we may know them,” that is, for sexual purposes, the angels asked Lot (in the words of ) “Do you have here (, "poh") any besides?” Which one could read as asking, “What else do you have in your mouth (, "peh") (to say in their favor)?” Then the angels told Lot that up until then, he had the right to plead in their defense, but thereafter, he had no right to plead for them.
The Master deduced from and that one can walk five mils (about 15,000 feet) in the time between the break of dawn and sunrise, as reports that “when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,” and reports that “The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar,” and Rabbi Haninah said that it was five mils from Sodom to Zoar. But the Gemara noted that as reports that “the angels hastened Lot,” they could naturally have covered more ground than a typical person.
Rabbi Eliezer taught that Lot lived in Sodom only on account of his property, but Rabbi Eliezer deduced from that Lot left Sodom empty-handed with the angels telling him, “It is enough that you escape with your life.” Rabbi Eliezer argued that Lot’s experience proved the maxim (of Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:5) that the property of the wicked, whether inside or outside the town, will be lost.
Rabbi Meir taught that while made clear that God would never again flood the world with water, demonstrated that God might bring a flood of fire and brimstone, as God brought upon Sodom and Gomorrah.
Rabbi Joshua ben Levi (according to the Jerusalem Talmud) or a Baraita in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yose the son of Rabbi Chanina (according to the Babylonian Talmud) said that the three daily prayers derived from the Patriarchs, and cited for the proposition that Jews derived the morning prayer from Abraham, arguing that within the meaning of “stood” meant “pray,” just as it did in 
Reading the words of "God remembered Abraham and sent out Lot," a Midrash asked what recollection was brought up in Lot’s favor? The Midrash answered that it was the silence that Lot maintained for Abraham when Abraham passed off Sarah as his sister.
Interpreting a Midrash taught that (as Mishnah Shabbat 16:1, Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 115a, 116b rules, if one's house is burning on the Sabbath) one is permitted to save the case of the Torah along with the Torah itself, and one is permitted to save the Tefillin bag along with the Tefillin. This teaches that the righteous are fortunate, and so are those who cleave to them. Similarly, says, "God remembered Noah, and all beasts, and all the animals that were with him in the Ark." And so too, in "God remembered Abraham and sent out Lot."
Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba, citing Rabbi Johanan, taught that God rewards even polite speech. In Lot’s older daughter named her son Moab (“of my father”), and so in God told Moses, “Be not at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle”; God forbade only war with the Moabites, but the Israelites might harass them. In in contrast, Lot’s younger daughter named her son Ben-Ammi (the less shameful “son of my people”), and so in God told Moses, “Harass them not, nor contend with them”; the Israelites were not to harass the Ammonites at all.
Genesis chapter 20.
The Rabbis taught that God appears to non-Jews only in dreams, as God appeared to Abimelech “in a dream of the night” in God appeared to Laban the “in a dream of the night” in and God appeared to Balaam “at night” in The Rabbis taught that God thus appeared more openly to the prophets of Israel than to those of other nations. The Rabbis compared God’s action to those of a king who has both a wife and a concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he goes stealthily. And a Midrash taught that God’s appearance to Abimelech in and God’s appearance to Laban in were the two instances where the Pure and Holy One allowed God’s self to be associated with impure (idolatrous) people, on behalf of righteous ones.
The Mishnah deduced from the example of Abimelech and Abraham in that even though an offender pays the victim compensation, the offence is not forgiven until the offender asks the victim for pardon. And the Mishnah deduced from Abraham’s example of praying for Abimelech in that under such circumstances, the victim would be churlish not to forgive the offender. The Tosefta further deduced from that even if the offender did not seek forgiveness from the victim, the victim must nonetheless seek mercy for the offender.
Rabbi Isaac taught that Abimelech’s curse of Sarah caused her son Isaac’s blindness (as reported in ). Rabbi Isaac read the words, “it is for you a covering ("kesut") of the eyes,” in not as "kesut", “covering,” but as "kesiyat", “blinding.” Rabbi Isaac concluded that one should not consider a small matter the curse of even an ordinary person.
Rava derived from and the lesson that if one has a need, but prays for another with the same need, then God will answer first the need of the one who prayed. Rava noted that Abraham prayed to God to heal Abimelech and his wife of infertility (in ) and immediately thereafter God allowed Abraham and Sarah to conceive (in ).
Genesis chapter 21.
The Rabbis linked parts of the parashah to Rosh Hashanah. The Talmud directs that Jews read (the expulsion of Hagar) on the first day of Rosh Hashanah and (the binding of Isaac) on the second day. And in the Talmud, Rabbi Eliezer said that God visited both Sarah and Hannah to grant them conception on Rosh Hashanah. Rabbi Eliezer deduced this from the Bible’s parallel uses of the words “visiting” and “remembering” in description of Hannah, Sarah, and Rosh Hashanah. First, Rabbi Eliezer linked Hannah’s visitation with Rosh Hashanah through the Bible’s parallel uses of the word “remembering.” says that God “remembered” Hannah and she conceived, and describes Rosh Hashanah as “a remembering of the blast of the trumpet.” Then Rabbi Eliezer linked Hannah’s conception with Sarah’s through the Bible’s parallel uses of the word “visiting.” says that “the Lord had visited Hannah,” and says that “the Lord visited Sarah.”
Rav Awira taught (sometimes in the name of Rabbi Ammi, sometimes in the name of Rabbi Assi) that the words “And the child grew, and was weaned ("va-yigamal", ), and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned” in teach that God will make a great feast for the righteous on the day that God manifests ("yigmol") God’s love to Isaac’s descendants. After they have eaten and drunk, they will ask Abraham to recite the Grace after meals ("Birkat Hamazon"), but Abraham will answer that he cannot say Grace, because he fathered Ishmael. Then they will ask Isaac to say Grace, but Isaac will answer that he cannot say Grace, because he fathered Esau. Then they will ask Jacob, but Jacob will answer that he cannot, because he married two sisters during both their lifetimes, which was destined to forbid. Then they will ask Moses, but Moses will answer that he cannot, because God did not allow him to enter the Land of Israel either in life or in death. Then they will ask Joshua, but Joshua will answer that he cannot, because he was not privileged to have a son, for reports, “Nun was his son, Joshua was his son,” without listing further descendants. Then they will ask David, and he will say Grace, and find it fitting for him to do so, because records David saying, “I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.”
The Gemara taught that if one sees Ishmael in a dream, then God hears that person’s prayer (perhaps because the name “Ishmael” derives from “the Lord has heard” in or perhaps because “God heard” ("yishmah Elohim", ) Ishmael’s voice in ).
The Gemara cited to teach that Sarah was one of seven prophetesses who prophesied to Israel and neither took away from nor added anything to what is written in the Torah. (The other prophetesses were Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Abigail, Huldah, and Esther.) The Gemara established Sarah’s status as a prophetess by citing the words, “Haran, the father of Milkah and the father of Yiscah,” in Rabbi Isaac taught that Yiscah was Sarah. called her Yiscah () because she discerned ("saketah") by means of Divine inspiration, as reports God instructing Abraham, “In all that Sarah says to you, hearken to her voice.” Alternatively, called her Yiscah because all gazed ("sakin") at her beauty.
The Sifre cited Abraham’s reproval of Abimelech in as an example of a tradition of admonition near death. The Sifre read to indicate that Moses spoke to the Israelites in rebuke. The Sifre taught that Moses rebuked them only when he approached death, and the Sifre taught that Moses learned this lesson from Jacob, who admonished his sons in only when he neared death. The Sifre cited four reasons why people do not admonish others until the admonisher nears death: (1) so that the admonisher does not have to repeat the admonition, (2) so that the one rebuked would not suffer undue shame from being seen again, (3) so that the one rebuked would not bear ill will to the admonisher, and (4) so that the one may depart from the other in peace, for admonition brings peace. The Sifre cited as examples of admonition near death: (1) when Abraham reproved Abimelech in (2) when Isaac reproved Abimelech, Ahuzzath, and Phicol in (3) when Joshua admonished the Israelites in (4) when Samuel admonished the Israelites in and (5) when David admonished Solomon in 
Rav Nachman taught that when Jacob “took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba” in he went to cut down the cedars that reports his grandfather Abraham had planted there.
Genesis chapter 22.
Rabbi Johanan, on the authority of Rabbi Jose ben Zimra, asked what means by the word “after” in “And it came to pass after these words, that God did tempt Abraham.” Rabbi Johanan explained that it meant after the words of Satan, as follows. After the events of which reports that Isaac grew, was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast the day that Isaac was weaned, Satan asked God how it could be that God graciously granted Abraham a child at the age of 100, yet of all that feast, Abraham did not sacrifice one turtle-dove or pigeon to God. Rather, Abraham did nothing but honor his son. God replied that were God to ask Abraham to sacrifice his son to God, Abraham would do so without hesitation. Straightway, as reports, “God did tempt Abraham.”
Rabbi Levi explained the words “after these words” in to mean after Ishmael's words to Isaac. Ishmael told Isaac that Ishmael was more virtuous than Isaac in good deeds, for Isaac was circumcised at eight days (and so could not prevent it), but Ishmael was circumcised at 13 years. Isaac questioned whether Ishamel would incense Isaac on account of one limb. Isaac vowed that if God were to ask Isaac to sacrifice himself before God, Isaac would obey. Immediately thereafter (in the words of ) “God did prove Abraham.”
A Midrash taught that Abraham said (beginning with the words of and ) "'Here I am' — ready for priesthood, ready for kingship" (ready to serve God in whatever role God chose), and Abraham attained both priesthood and kingship. He attained priesthood, as says, "The Lord has sworn, and will not repent: 'You are a priest forever after the manner of Melchizedek." And he attained kingship, as says, "You are a mighty prince among us."
Rabbi Simeon bar Abba explained that the word "na" () in “Take, I pray ("na", ) your son,” can denote only entreaty. Rabbi Simeon bar Abba compared this to a king who was confronted by many wars, which he won with the aid of a great warrior. Subsequently, he was faced with a severe battle. Thereupon the king asked the warrior, “I pray, assist me in battle, so that people may not say that there was nothing to the earlier battles.” Similarly, God said to Abraham, “I have tested you with many trials and you withstood all of them. Now, be firm, for My sake in this trial, so that people may not say that there was nothing to the earlier trials.”
The Gemara expanded on explaining that it reports only one side of a dialog. God told Abraham, “take your son,” but Abraham replied, “I have two sons!” God said, “Your only one,” but Abraham replied, “Each is the only one of his mother!” God said, “Whom you love,” but Abraham replied, “I love them both!” Then God said, “Isaac!” The Gemara explained that God employed all this circumlocution in so that Abraham’s mind should not reel under the sudden shock of God’s command.
A Baraita interpreted to teach that the whole eighth day is valid for circumcision, but deduced from Abraham’s rising “early in the morning” to perform his obligations in that the zealous perform circumcisions early in the morning.
A Tanna taught in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Eleazar that intense love and hate can cause one to disregard the perquisites of one’s social position. The Tanna deduced that love may do so from Abraham, for reports that “Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey,” rather than allow his servant to do so. Similarly, the Tanna deduced that hate may do so from Balaam, for reports that “Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey,” rather than allow his servant to do so.
The Sifra cited and for the proposition that when God called the name of a prophet twice, God expressed affection and sought to provoke a response. Similarly, Rabbi Hiyya taught that it was an expression of love and encouragement. Rabbi Liezer taught that the repetition indicated that God spoke to Abraham and to future generations. Rabbi Liezer taught that there is no generation that does not contain people like Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and Samuel.
Noting that reports that “Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him (, "ahar") a ram,” a Midrash asked what “behind” (, "ahar") meant. Rabbi Judan taught that it meant "after all that happened", Israel would still fall into the clutches of sin and thus become victims of persecution. But they would be ultimately redeemed by the ram’s horn, as says, “And the Lord God will blow the horn.” Similarly, Rav Huna son of Rabbi Isaac read to teach that God showed Abraham the ram tearing itself free from one thicket and getting entangled in another. God told Abraham that in a similar manner, Abraham’s children would be caught by the nations and entangled in troubles, being dragged from empire to empire, from Babylon to Media, from Media to Greece, and from Greece to Edom (Rome), but they would ultimately be redeemed through the horns of the ram. And hence says, “The Lord shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord God will blow the horn.”
Rabbi Josiah taught in his father’s name that God created the ram that reports Abraham sacrificed in lieu of Isaac on the eve of the first Sabbath at twilight (indicating the miraculous nature of its appearance).
Some say the merit of Abraham’s actions saved later Israelites. reports that after David ordered a census of the Israelites, God punished the Israelites with a plague. then reports, “And as He was about to destroy, the Lord beheld, and He repented Him.” The Gemara asked what God beheld that caused God to withhold destruction. Samuel taught that God beheld the ashes of Isaac. For in Abraham says, “God will see for Himself the lamb.” (Thus God saw the merit of the sacrifice that Abraham brought — or intended to bring.) Alternatively, Rabbi Johanan taught that God saw the Temple. For explained the meaning of the name that Abraham gave to the mountain where Abraham nearly sacrificed Isaac to be, “In the mount where the Lord is seen.” (Solomon later built the Temple on that mountain, and God saw the merit of the sacrifices there.) Rabbi Jacob bar Iddi and Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani differed on the matter. One said that God saw the atonement money that reports God required Moses to collect from the Israelites, while the other said that God saw the Temple. The Gemara concluded that the more likely view was that God saw the Temple, as can be read to say, “As it will be said on that day, ‘in the mount where the Lord is seen.’”
God’s promise to Abraham in that God would multiply his children like the stars figures in a midrashic interpretation of the Plagues of Egypt. Finding four instances of the verb “to charge,” for example in (, "vayetzan"), a Midrash taught that Pharaoh decreed upon the Israelites four decrees. At first, he commanded the taskmasters to insist that the Israelites make the prescribed number of bricks. Then he commanded that the taskmasters not allow the Israelites to sleep in their homes, intending by this to limit their ability to have children. The taskmasters told the Israelites that if they went home to sleep, they would lose a few hours each morning from work and never complete the allotted number or bricks, as reports: “And the taskmasters were urgent, saying: ‘Fulfill your work.’” So the Israelites slept on the ground in the brickyard. God told the Egyptians that God had promised the Israelites’ ancestor Abraham that God would multiply his children like the stars, as in God promised Abraham: “That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying, I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven.” But now the Egyptians were cunningly planning that the Israelites not increase. So God set about to see that God’s word prevail, and immediately reports: “But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied.” When Pharaoh saw that the Israelites increased abundantly despite his decrees, he then decreed concerning the male children, as reports: “And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives . . . and he said: ‘When you do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, you shall look upon the birthstool: if it be a son, then you shall kill him.’” So finally (as reports), “Pharaoh charged all his people, saying: ‘Every son that is born you shall cast into the river.’”
Noting that speaks of only Abraham when it says, “So Abraham returned to his young men,” a Midrash asked: Where was Isaac? Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of the Rabbis of Babylon that Abraham sent Isaac to Shem to study Torah. The Midrash compared this to a woman who became wealthy through her spinning. She concluded that since she had become wealthy through her distaff, it would never leave her hand. Similarly, Abraham deduced that since all that had come to him was only because he engaged in Godly pursuits, he was unwilling that those should ever depart from his descendants. And Rabbi Jose the son of Rabbi Haninah taught that Abraham sent Isaac home at night, for fear of the evil eye.
A Midrash interpreted the words “his eyes were dim from seeing” in to teach that Isaac’s eyesight dimmed as a result of his near sacrifice in for when Abraham bound Isaac, the ministering angels wept, as says, “Behold, their valiant ones cry without, the angels of peace weep bitterly,” and tears dropped from the angels’ eyes into Isaac’s, leaving their mark and causing Isaac’s eyes to dim when he became old.
A Midrash told that at the very moment in that the angel of the Lord stayed Abraham from sacrificing Isaac, the Satan appeared to Sarah in the guise of Isaac. When Sarah saw him, she asked what Abraham had done to him. He told Sarah that Abraham had taken him to a mountain, built an altar, placed wood upon it, tied him down on it, and took a knife to slaughter him, and had God not told him not to lay a hand on him, Abraham would have slaughtered him. And as soon as he finished speaking, Sarah’s soul departed. Thus the Midrash deduced from the words “Abraham "came" to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her” in that Abraham came directly from Mount Moriah and the binding of Isaac.
A Midrash asked why, in Jacob “offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac,” and not to the God of Abraham and Isaac. Rabbi Berekiah observed that God never unites God’s Name with a living person (to say, for example, “I am the God of Jacob,” while they are alive) except with those who are experiencing suffering. (And thus Jacob referred to the God of Isaac instead of the God of Jacob.) And Rabbi Berekiah also observed that Isaac did indeed experience suffering. The Rabbis said that we look upon Isaac as if his ashes were heaped in a pile on the altar. (And thus Jacob referred to Isaac to invoke the memory of Abraham’s near-sacrifice of Isaac in as if it had been carried out).
Interpreting God’s command to Isaac in not to go to Egypt, Rabbi Hoshaya taught that God told Isaac that he was, by virtue of his near-sacrifice in a burnt-offering without blemish, and as a burnt offering became unfit if it was taken outside of the Temple grounds, so would Isaac become unfit if he went outside of the Promised Land.
Commandments.
According to Maimonides and Sefer ha-Chinuch, there are no commandments in the parashah.
As the sages read “And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre” (when Abraham was still recovering from his circumcision in ) to report that God visited Abraham when Abraham was ill, the "Kitzur Shulchan Aruch" teaches that everyone is obligated to visit a person who becomes ill.
In the liturgy.
Some Jews refer to the ten trials of Abraham in as they study chapter 5 of "Pirkei Avot" on a Sabbath between Passover and Rosh Hashanah.
The Passover Haggadah, in the concluding "nirtzah" section of the Seder, in a reference to Abraham’s visitors in recounts how God knocked on Abraham’s door at the heat of the day on Passover and Abraham fed his visitors matzah cakes, deducing the season from the report in that Lot fed his visitors matzah. The Haggadah recounts that Abraham ran to the herd. And the Haggadah continues that it was thus on Passover that the Sodomites were consumed by God’s fire, as reported in 
Also in the "nirtzah" section of the seder, in a reference to or the Haggadah recounts how God judged the King of Gerar Abimelech in the middle of the night.
The Rabbis understood Abraham’s devotion to God in the binding of Isaac in to have earned God’s mercy for Abraham’s descendents when they are in need. The 16th century Safed Rabbi Eliezer Azikri drew on this rabbinic understanding to call for God to show mercy for Abraham’s descendents, “the son of Your beloved” ("ben ohavach"), in his kabbalistic poem "Yedid Nefesh" (“Soul’s Beloved”), which many congregations chant just before the Kabbalat Shabbat prayer service.
And many Jews, following Kabbalistic masters from the Zohar to Arizal, recite the binding of Isaac, after the morning blessings ("Birkat HaShachar"). The recitation of Abraham’s and Isaac’s willingness to put God above life itself is meant to invoke God’s mercy, to inspire worshipers to greater love of God, and to bring atonement to the penitent.
Haftarah.
The haftarah for the parashah is:
The parashah and haftarah in 2 Kings both tell of God’s gift of sons to childless women. In both the parashah and the haftarah: God’s representative visits the childless woman, whose household extends the visitor generous hospitality; the husband’s age raises doubt about the couple’s ability to have children; God’s representative announces that a child will come at a specified season in the next year; the woman conceives and bears a child as God’s representative had announced; death threatens the promised child; and God’s representative intervenes to save the promised child.

Internet transit

Internet transit is the service of allowing network traffic to cross or "transit" a computer network, usually used to connect a smaller Internet service provider (ISP) to the larger Internet. Technically, it consists of two bundled services:
In the 1970s and early 1980s-era Internet, the assumption was made that all networks would provide full transit for one another. In the modern private-sector Internet, two forms of interconnect agreements exist between Internet networks: transit, and peering. Transit is distinct from peering, in which only traffic between the two ISPs and their downstream customers is exchanged and neither ISP can see upstream routes over the peering connection. A transit free network uses only peering; a network that uses only unpaid peering and connects to the whole Internet is considered a Tier 1 network. In the 1990s, the network access point concept provided one form of transit.
The transit service is typically priced per megabit per second per month, and customers are often required to commit to a minimum volume of bandwidth, and usually to a minimum term of service as well. Some transit agreements provide "service-level agreements" which purport to offer money-back guarantees of performance between the customer's Internet connection and specific points on the Internet, typically major Internet exchange points within a continental geography such as North America. These service level agreements still provide only best-effort delivery since they do not guarantee service the other half of the way, from the Internet exchange point to the final destination.

Fitzroy Harbour, Ontario

Fitzroy Harbour is a small village within the city of Ottawa in eastern Ontario, Canada. It is located on the Ottawa River at the mouth of the Carp River. A branch of the Mississippi River, known as the Snye, also empties into the Ottawa to the west of the village.
Fitzroy Provincial Park [http://www.ontarioparks.com/english/fitz.html] is located nearby.
The village has one school located within it, St.Michael's Catholic school. Formerly, it had a now-defunct public school. There are also three churches. 
History.
The town was founded by Charles Shirreff in 1831. There was a waterfall known as Chats Falls on the river here, later replaced by a hydroelectric power station and dam, currently operated by Ontario Power Generation.
By 1866, Fitzroy Harbour was a post village with a population of 200 of the Fitzroy Township, on the Ottawa river, at the head of the Duchesne lake navigation, on a small bay, dotted with beautiful islands. The picturesque Chats Falls, which form eleven falls, and plunge thirty-three feet is nearby. On the south side of the river, directly opposite the village, was the Government timber slide. The community had hydroelectroelectric power, manufacturing, three churches, built of stone: the Chnrch of England, the Canada Presbyterian church, and the Roman Catholic church. The Fourth Division Court was held here and at Riddle's Corners, alternately. The Loyal Orange Lodge, No. 541, met at thc Orange Hall, on the first Friday in each month. 
In 1974, the township was amalgamated with Huntley and Torbolton to form West Carleton. In 2001, West Carleton became part of the new city of Ottawa.

Walter Keane

Walter Stanley Keane (October 7, 1915 – December 27, 2000) was an American artist who became famous in the early 1960's for a series of widely-reproduced paintings depicting vulnerable waifs with enormous eyes. In subsequent years, it was determined in legal proceedings that the artist Margaret Keane, who was married to Keane from 1955-65, was the actual designer and painter of the works that had become famous under the name of Walter Keane.
Background.
Walter Keane was born in Lincoln, Nebraska in October 7, 1915, one of 10 children from his father's second marriage. His father, Stanley Keane, was born in Ireland; his mother was from Denmark. Keane grew up near the center of Lincoln and made money by selling shoes. In the early 1930s he moved to Los Angeles, California where he attended Los Angeles City College. He moved to Berkeley, California in the 1940s with his bride, Barbara (née Ingham), and went into real estate, both were real estate brokers.
Their first child, a son, died shortly after birth in the hospital. In 1947 they had a healthy baby girl, Susan Hale Keane. Walter and Barbara bought a huge home, over 5,000 sq ft (with a ballroom) designed by the architect Julia Morgan (who also designed Hearst Castle.) In 1948 the Keanes traveled to Europe, living in Heidelberg and later Paris. It was in Paris that Walter studied art, painting primarily nudes and Paris street scenes. His wife Barbara studied cooking at Le Cordon Bleu, and also studied dress design in various Couturier Houses in Paris. When they returned to their home in Berkeley, began an educational toy business called "Susie Keane's Puppeteens", teaching children to speak French through the use of handmade puppets, phonograph records, and a book. The "ballroom" of their large home became an assembly line of hand painted "wide eyed" wooden puppets, with various intricately made costumes. The puppets were sold in high-end stores like Saks Fifth Avenue.
Barbara Keane later became head of her own department in dress design at the University of California in Berkeley. Walter Keane subsequently closed his Berkeley, California real estate firm and the toy company to devote full-time to his painting. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1952. At a fairgrounds in 1953, Walter met an artist doing charcoal sketches, her name was Margaret (Doris Hawkins) Ulbrich. She was married to Frank Ulbrich and had one daughter, Jane Ulbrich. Margaret and Frank later divorced, and Margaret married Walter Keane in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1955.
Walter Keane married his third wife, Joan Mervin of British Columbia, Canada, after his divorce with Margaret was final. They had two children in the early 1970s, while living in London, England. That marriage also ended in divorce.
Art.
Keane claimed his inspiration for the big-eyed children came when he was in Europe as an art student. He is quoted as saying, "My psyche was scarred in my art student days in Europe, just after World War II, by an ineradicable memory of war-wracked innocents. In their eyes lurk all of mankind's questions and answers. If mankind would look deep into the soul of the very young, he wouldn't need a road map. I wanted other people to know about those eyes, too. I want my paintings to clobber you in the heart and make you yell, 'DO SOMETHING!"
In 1957, after having been painting full-time for nine years, Keane decided it would be "a good idea" to display his work at the Outsider Art show being held in Washington Square in Manhattan. In 1959 he and wife Margaret were referred to as "the family that paints together sells together". In a New York exhibition, patrons bought 20 pieces of Walter's, 20 of Margaret's, and six painted by their daughters Susan and Jane. In 1961, The Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation bought Keane's painting "Our Children" and presented it to the United Nations Children's Fund. It is in the United Nations permanent collection of art. In 1965 Keane was named "one of the most controversial and most successful painters at work today", with his works owned by many celebrities and hanging in many permanent collections.
Dispute.
As early as 1957 it was reported that Margaret superimposed some of her work onto her husband's paintings, with Walter quoted as saying, "When I paint people, she usually complains that the eyes aren't big enough and proceeds to make them bigger," but photos released in 1961 showed both Walter and Margaret at the same time painting portraits of actress Natalie Wood, with Margaret representing her as a "pensive, sophisticated woman" and Walter portraying her as a "wistful, wide-eyed waif", as well as additional photos showing the two Keanes at work in their studio, both painting 'big-eyed' portraits, with the figures in Walter's work having their eyes more exaggerated than those of Margaret's. Walter Keane, who claimed credit for her work. Conflict over that issue was cited as one of the reasons they divorced. The Keanes' divorce proceedings went all the way to federal court. At the hearing, Margaret challenged Walter to a "paint-off" and created a painting in front of the judge to prove that she was the artist. Walter declined to paint before the court, citing a sore shoulder.
The couple separated in November 1964 and a divorce was granted in May 1965. After their separation, and in speaking about how the two met, Margaret stated "It was the eyes that did it. I liked the way he painted eyes and he liked mine." "...I admire his genius tremendously." By 1970, Margaret was remarried, having wed Honolulu sportswriter Dan McGuire.
The dispute between Margaret and Walter began after release of a news article in which Walter compared himself to Rembrandt and El Greco. In a response at odds with released photographs of the two at work and her own earlier published remarks, Margaret stated that it was actually she who did all the 'eyes' paintings and then issued a public challenge to Walter for a "paint off" to be held in San Francisco's Union Square. Walter chose to ignore Margaret's challenge, being initially "flabbergasted and at a loss for words", and then later "amused by the claims". Margaret appeared and produced a painting, but Walter did not attend.
In 1984, Margaret continued asserting that her ex-husband "couldn't learn to paint at all", and challenged Walter to another paint-off. In an announcement of the new challenge, she was quoted as saying, "Let him paint or shut up". Walter had suggested to "USA Today" that Margaret was claiming credit for the pictures only because she thought he was dead. In response, she slapped him with a slander suit. During the 1986 lawsuit, a federal judge in Honolulu, Hawaii ordered both Walter and Margaret Keane to paint pictures for the jury. Margaret produced a painting in 53 minutes, while Walter pleaded that he was taking medication for a painfully injured shoulder and declined to paint. Margaret also brought in drawings with similarly over-sized eyes she completed at eleven years of age. Losing the lawsuit, he was ordered to pay her $4 million for emotional distress and damaged reputation.
Even having lost the suit, Keane continued to insist that he was the creator of the big-eyed children. Walter Keane, who habitually referred to himself in the third person, took special pride in the eyes, which were part of the reason for his commercial success. Their dispute continued for decades, with both Walter and Margaret claiming to be creators of the large eye motif. In 1991, he was quoted as saying, "I painted the waifs of the world." Rumors of Keane having died in 1993 were dispelled when he showed up in early December at a location in Brentwood to autograph copies of his autobiography, "The World of Keane."
Keane was 85 when he died 7 years later, on December 27, 2000, in Encinitas, California.
Cultural references.
A Keane painting makes a brief appearance in the 1973 Woody Allen movie "Sleeper". Upon seeing it, Diane Keaton punningly says, "It's keen. No, no, it's greater than keen—it's Cugat!" 
Film.
Tim Burton is directing and producing the upcoming film based on Keane's life, titled "Big Eyes". It is set to release to theaters in August 2014 with Christoph Waltz playing Keane and Amy Adams playing his wife, Margaret.

McDonald criteria

The McDonald criteria are diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS). These criteria are named after neurologist W. Ian McDonald. In April 2001, an international panel in association with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) of America recommended revised diagnostic criteria for MS. They discourage the previously used terms such as "clinically definite" and "probable MS", and propose as diagnostic either "MS", "possible MS", or "not MS". They have undergone revisions in 2005 and 2010.
They make use of advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and are intended to replace the Poser criteria and the older Schumacher criteria. The new criteria facilitate the diagnosis of MS in patients who present with signs and symptoms suggestive of the disease. These include monosymptomatic disease, disease with a typical relapsing-remitting course or insidious progression but no clear attacks and remissions.
The McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis were revised in 2005 to clarify exactly what is meant by an "attack", "dissemination" and a "positive MRI", etc.
Any diagnostic criterion relies on definition or another more basic criterion. The original article of McDonald states that "MS is a clinical entity and therefore should be with clinical and paraclinical criteria". Nevertheless, they acknowledge the existence of lesion-based MS definition, saying that some other groups consider that "the only proved diagnosis of MS can be made upon autopsy, or occasionally upon biopsy, where lesions typical of MS can be directly detected through standard histopathological techniques".
The 2010 McDonald criteria are regarded as the gold standard for MS diagnosis.
Criticism.
McDonald criteria have been shown to have a low sensitivity and specificity (with respect to the presence of lesions) in Asiatic populations. They present instead a good behaviour (respect CIS to CDMS conversion) when evaluated in non-selected populations.
Some other authors consider McDonald criteria as an attempt for a clinical definition and propose a pathological definition instead. According to Hans Lassmann, the pathological definition should be preferred because the clinical definitions have problems with differential diagnosis. Besides, subclinical MS cases would not be accepted as MS cases by these criteria.
Finally, McDonald also states "objective evidence of dissemination in time and space of lesions typical of MS is essential in making a secure diagnosis, as is the exclusion of other, better explanations for the clinical features". Therefore, when used as a definition, the McDonald criteria are defining MS just by exclusion of other diseases.
2010 Revisions.
In 2010, the International Panel on Diagnosis of MS met in Dublin, Ireland for a third time to discuss and revise the McDonald diagnostic criteria above. Reasons for revisions to the criteria included the simplification of demonstration of CNS lesions in space and time via imaging, and the above criticisms that the previous criteria did not appropriately apply to non-Western Caucasian populations.
One study has suggested that the new criteria allow a faster diagnosis, but with slight sacrifice in accuracy.

Tom Veivers

Thomas Robert Veivers (born 6 April 1937, Beenleigh, Queensland) is a former Australian cricketer who played in 21 Tests from 1963 to 1967. He was an all-rounder who bowled right arm off-spin bowler and batted left-handed. He later had a brief political career, holding the seat of Ashgrove in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1983 to 1986 for the Australian Labor Party. He was Commissioner-General of the Australian Pavilion at World Expo 88 in Brisbane in 1988.He was Chairman of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research Trust for ten years from 1991 to 2000 and appointed a Fellow of the Institute in 2000. 
Educated at Downlands College, in Toowoomba in southeastern Queensland, Veivers attended the University of Queensland, whom he represented in club cricket. He was made the captain of the Queensland Colts and scored 126 against the New South Wales Colts in 1958/59. He made his first-class debut in same season against the touring English cricket team and made his Sheffield Shield that season also. He played as a middle order batsman and off-spinner, but did not command a regular spot in the Sheffield Shield team until the following season. He was selected for his first Australian squad in 1962, playing in an Australian XI against the visiting English team, in which he was hit for two sixes by Ted Dexter in his opening over. John Woodcock of "The Times" wrote "I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely to forget it. Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards." He was then selected for the Test team the following season to make his debut against South Africa in the First Test in Brisbane, in which he scored 14 batting at No. 8 and took 1/48. He was omitted for the third and fourth Tests, but managed to defy the South Africans with stubborn batting in the fifth Test in Sydney, salvaging a draw. He toured England in 1964, playing all Tests and scoring two half centuries and three three-wicket hauls. He followed this with two more half centuries and a career best of 4/68 on the tour to India.
He scored his Test best of 88 against Pakistan in Australia the following season but was unavailable to tour the West Indies in 1965 due to personal reasons. He had a difficult 1965-66 Ashes series back home against England, taking just four wickets and one half-century and then went on the 1966-67 tour of South Africa, which was his last international representation for Australia. He retired from first-class cricket the following year. His career was hampered by his bowling, which was seen as economical but not penetrative, with an average of over 40 [http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=1214;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1963-12-06;start=1963-12-06;enddefault=1967-02-08;end=1967-02-08;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype].

Veivers bowled 75 of the last 80 overs delivered from the City end, and finished with figures of 95.1-36-155-3.This is the most number of balls bowled in a single innings of a Test Match by an Australian.
Veivers served as a Brisbane radio station executive, before serving as the secretary of the Queensland Cricket Association from 1974 to 1977 and a state selector from 1977 to 1982. He was the president of the QCA from 1989 to 1992.He was made a Life Member of Queensland Cricket in 2006.

Emory Peak

Emory Peak, located in Big Bend National Park, is the highest peak in the Chisos Mountains. and the highest in Brewster County. The peak is named for William H. Emory, the chief surveyor of the U.S. Boundary Survey team of 1852. From the Chisos Basin the peak appears to be a minor ridge, while the summit of Casa Grande, one mile closer, seems to be much taller. From the west, Emory Peak is clearly visible as a point slightly higher than most of the mountain range.
The peak can be reached by a moderate hike on a well-marked path across steep rocky terrain with an elevation gain of approximately . The Emory Peak Trail is about long. Once at the base there is a semi-technical rock scramble to navigate before reaching the summit. No gear is needed for this climb although hikers should take great care. High-desert flora and fauna including alligator juniper ("Juniperus deppeana"), pinyon pine ("Pinus cembroides"), mule deer ("Odocoileus hemionus"), prickly pear cacti ("Opuntia" spp.), Mexican Jay ("Aphelocoma wollweberi"), sotol ("Dasylirion leiophyllum"), and Texas madrone ("Arbutus xalapensis") may be seen along the trail. There are signs warning of mountain lions and bears.
The view from the top takes in most of the northern section of the park and a good portion of the Chisos range to the south. One surprise at the top, during the right season, is the population of lady bugs on the summit. There are solar panels, radio transmission equipment, and antennae at the top.

Lent Bumps

The Lent Bumps (also Lent Races, Lents) are a set of rowing races held annually on the River Cam in Cambridge. They began in 1887, after separating from the May Bumps, the equivalent bumping races held in mid-June. Prior to the separation there had been a single set of annual bumps dating from its inception in 1827. The races are open to all college boat clubs from the University of Cambridge, the University Medical and Veterinary Schools and Anglia Ruskin Boat Club. The Lent Bumps takes place over five days (Tuesday to Saturday) either at the end of February or start of March and is run as a bumps race. 
The most recent in the series is the Lent Bumps 2013, which ran from 26 February 2013 to 2 March 2013.
Structure.
The races are run in divisions, each containing 17 crews. The number of crews in each bottom division varies yearly depending on new entrants. Each crew contains eight rowers and one coxswain. Unlike the May Bumps, rowers trialling for spaces in university crews are not allowed to take part in the Lents. A total of 121 crews took part in 2012, totalling around 1100 participants. There are currently four divisions for men's crews (referred to as M1, M2 ... M4) and three divisions for women's crews (similarly W1–W3). The divisions represent a total race order with Division 1 at the top. The ultimate aim is to try to finish "Head of the River" (also said as gaining the 'Headship'), i.e. first position in division 1. 
At the start, signalled by a cannon, each crew is separated by a distance of about 1½ boat lengths (approximately 30 m or 90 ft). Once the race has begun, a crew must attempt to catch up with the crew ahead of it and "bump" (physically touch or overtake it) before the crew behind does the same to them. A crew which bumps or is bumped must pull to the side of the river to allow other crews to continue racing. A crew which neither bumps the crew ahead nor is bumped by the crew behind before crossing the finishing post is said to have "rowed over". Any crew which bumps then swaps places with the crew that it bumped in the following day's racing. A crew which rows over stays in the same position. Crews finishing at the top of a division, the "sandwich boat", row at the bottom of the next division to try to move up a division. The process is repeated over four days, allowing crews to move up or down in the overall order of boats. The finish order of one year's Lent Bumps is then used as the starting order of the following year's races.
Crews finishing Head of the River.
Men's Lent Bumps (1887 - 2013).
NB. Lent Bumps were cancelled between 1915 and 1918 due to war, and in 1895 and 1963 due to ice. The Lents in 1888 was not completed due to the death of an oarsman. When the races ceased, were in 1st position. The Lent Bumps 2001 were not completed due to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in the UK. The outbreak closed the tow-path along the river, where all of the umpiring for the bumps takes place. When the races were abandoned on Friday 2 March 2001, were in 1st position.
In 1919, college 1st VIIIs did not race as it was the first race after World War I. The start order for the 1920 races was the finish order for the 1914 races. Prior to 1946 were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.
Women's Lent Bumps (1976 - 2014).
NB. The Women's Lent Bumps were not completed in 2001 due to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in the UK. When the races were abandoned on Friday 2 March 2001, were in 1st position.
Table of Winning Boats (1887-2013).
Eighteen boats have been head of the river. 
"*" The head of the river in 1919 was, unusually, 1st Trinity’s second boat. It was the first race after World War I and 1st eights did not race. The start order for the 1920 races was the finish order for the 1914 races.
NB. Prior to 1946 were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.
CCAT, Christ's, Clare Hall, Darwin, Homerton, Hughes Hall, King's, Lucy Cavendish, Magdalene, Robinson, St. Catharine's, Selwyn, Sidney Sussex, St Edmund's, Wolfson, Addenbrooke's and the Veterinary School are the regular entrants never to have finished Head of the River for either the men's or women's events.

Cladribine

Cladribine (trade names "Leustatin"; "Litak and Movectro"') is a drug used to treat hairy cell leukemia (HCL, leukemic reticuloendotheliosis) and multiple sclerosis. Its chemical name is 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CDA).
As a purine analog, it is a synthetic anti-cancer agent that also suppresses the immune system. Chemically, it mimics the nucleoside adenosine and thus inhibits the enzyme adenosine deaminase, which interferes with the cell's ability to process DNA. It is easily destroyed by normal cells except for blood cells, with the result that it produces relatively few side effects and results in very little non-target cell loss.
Indications.
Cladribine (as injections) is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic hairy cell leukemia.
It is under investigation for other B cell leukemias and lymphomas, such as mantle cell lymphoma, and for use in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
According to the Histiocytosis Association, cladribine is used to treat histiocytosis.
Multiple sclerosis.
In January 2010, a large clinical trial involving more than 1000 patients documented significant reduction in relapse rates in multiple sclerosis patients with use of "oral" cladribine and thus making its use as the first oral medication in multiple sclerosis patients, most likely in year .
Russia was the first country to approve it for treating multiple sclerosis on July 12, 2010. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency's CHMP did not approve cladribine in the first application, as did the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As of March 2, 2011, the FDA has rejected oral cladribine for multiple sclerosis, "acknowledging sufficient data on the drug’s efficacy in multiple sclerosis but requiring more data on safety and risk-benefit " 
June 2011 : Merck has decided to withdraw all marketing applications for cladribine tablets, and to stop selling it in Russia and Australia which had approved it.
Routes of administration.
For hairy cell leukemia, cladribine can be given by i.v. infusion or subcutaneous (s.c.) injection.
For outpatient i.v. infusions, the delivery time (not including time to place the i.v. line) may range from one to four hours; two hours is most common. Continuous i.v. infusion may be chosen; this approach drips in the cladribine slowly, 24 hours a day using a portable pump and a central venous catheter or a PICC line. By contrast, s.c. injections take less than ten seconds per day.
The same total doses are given by both routes. Intravenous and s.c. routes have the same overall outcomes, and the s.c. route may be reduce the infections and other risks associated with venipuncture.
An oral tablet form of cladribine has been successfully tested in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis.
Treatment schedule.
Using either i.v. or s.c. routes of administration, cladribine can be administered on a daily or a weekly schedule. Daily schedules involve one s.c. injection or one i.v. infusion per day for five to seven consecutive days. Weekly schedules involve one injection or infusion each week, for five or six weeks. One cycle is normally sufficient to produce a complete response, but in the event of a partial response, cycles may safely be repeated one to three months after the end of the first cycle.
Actual doses are calculated according to the surface area of the patient's skin instead of by weight, and divided by the number of planned treatments.
All schedules produce the same benefits and disadvantages. Five-day and seven-day daily schedules give the same total amount of drug and have the same outcomes, including remissions and adverse effects. Daily and weekly schedules give the same total amount of drug and have the same outcomes, including similar proportions of complete responses and similar proportions of patients hospitalized for fevers and opportunistic infections.
Adverse effects.
Existing studies estimate that from 18% to 42% of patients will experience a fever after cladribine infusion. This is usually a transient fever which can be treated with acetaminophen (paracetamol). In some cases these fevers resolve in less than 48 hours, with no evidence of infection.
However, other patients have fevers that last longer and may be caused by an infection. Very few infections have actually been documented, but they do happen, and these infections are largely responsible for the 3% mortality rate associated with cladribine therapy in HCL. Factors that increased the likelihood of a neutropenic fever (with or without concomitant infection) include: anemia, hypocholesterolemia, a high proportion of hairy cells in the bone marrow with a low proportion of myelopoietic cells, low albumin, and high C-reactive protein. These are all signs of an advanced case of HCL.
In patients with hairy cell leukemia, there is no benefit to using hormones such as filgrastim or Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor to raise white blood cell counts prophylactically. The use of these expensive drugs does not reduce the number of patients who experience fevers, the number of days that the fevers last, or the number of patients admitted to the hospital for antibiotic treatments. Therefore routine adjunctive use (that is, use when there are no signs of infection) is not recommended.
In addition to fevers, cladribine increases the risk of herpes virus infections, particularly shingles.
Some patients develop a rash after treatment. Nearly all patients who develop a rash are taking other drugs, notably allopurinol or a sulfa drug, which are known to cause rashes, and the rash is likely due to these drugs rather than to cladribine itself.
Some HCL patients will require blood transfusions of platelets or packed red blood cells.
Patients are expected to experience a decline in blood cell counts during treatment. Several weeks after successful treatment, cell counts will begin to rebound, with platelet and neutrophil counts recovering before red blood cells and T cells. T4 cell counts may never reach pre-disease levels. Patients are usually advised to avoid sick people and large crowds of people as well as to wash their hands and keep their hands away from their eyes, nose, and mouth until their neutrophil counts have recovered.
Many patients experience fatigue, even in the absence of anemia, but since fatigue is a common feature of the disease, this may be caused by the disease instead of by the drug.
This drug does not cause hair loss, vomiting, or other side effects that are commonly associated with "old style" alkylating chemotherapy drugs. However, peripheral neuropathy has been reported occasionally after repeated doses of cladribine in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. Overdose may cause kidney damage.
Response.
According to the drug's FDA-approved prescribing information, the median time to normalization of blood counts in patients with hairy cell leukemia is: two weeks for platelets, five weeks for absolute neutrophil counts, eight weeks for hemoglobin, and nine weeks for a patient to have all three parameters normalized. Weeks are counted from the first day of treatment, and all patients were on a seven-day daily treatment schedule for these studies.
History.
Cladribine was designed by Dennis A. Carson as an anti-lymphocyte compound, while he was at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. It was first synthesized at Brigham Young University.
The pharmacology and clinical applications were researched by scientists at Johnson and Johnson , which filed the NDA and launched the drug in 1993.
In 2008, Ernest Beutler of The Scripps Research Institute won the Wallace H. Coulter Award for Lifetime Achievement in Hematology from the Coulter Foundation and the American Society of Hematology in part because of the clinical trials he ran, which established cladribine as the most effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia (HCL).

Energy–momentum relation

In physics, the energy–momentum relation is the relativistic equation relating any object's rest (intrinsic) mass, total energy, and momentum:
holds for a system, such as a particle or macroscopic body, having intrinsic rest mass , total energy , and a momentum of magnitude , where the constant "c" is the speed of light, assuming the special relativity case of flat spacetime.
The energy-momentum relation () is consistent with the familiar mass-energy relation in both its interpretations: relates total energy to the (total) relativistic mass (alternatively denoted or ), while relates rest energy to rest (invariant) mass which we denote . Unlike either of those equations, the energy-momentum equation () relates the "total" energy to the "rest" mass . All three equations hold true simultaneously.
Special cases of the relation () include:
A more general form of relation () holds for general relativity.
The invariant mass (or rest mass) is an invariant for all frames of reference (hence the name), not just in inertial frames in flat spacetime, but also accelerated frames traveling through curved spacetime (see below). However the total energy of the particle and its relativistic momentum are frame-dependent; relative motion between two frames causes the observers in those frames to measure different values of the particle's energy and momentum; one frame measures and , while the other frame measures and , where and , unless there is no relative motion between observers, in which case each observer measures the same energy and momenta. Although we still have, in flat spacetime;
The quantities , , , are all related by a Lorentz transformation. The relation allows one to sidestep Lorentz transformations when determining only the magnitudes of the energy and momenta by equating the relations in the different frames. Again in flat spacetime, this translates to;
Since does not change from frame to frame, the energy–momentum relation is used in relativistic mechanics and particle physics calculations, as energy and momentum are given in a particle's rest frame (that is, and as an observer moving with the particle would conclude to be) and measured in the lab frame (i.e. and as determined by particle physicists in a lab, and not moving with the particles).
In relativistic quantum mechanics, it is the basis for constructing relativistic wave equations, since if the relativistic wave equation describing the particle is consistent with this equation – it is consistent with relativistic mechanics, and is Lorentz invariant. In relativistic quantum field theory, it is applicable to all particles and fields.
This article will use the conventional notation for the "square of a vector" as the dot product of a vector with itself: .
Origins of the equation.
The equation can be derived in a number of ways, two of the simplest include:
Heuristic approach for massive particles.
For a massive object moving at three-velocity with magnitude in the lab frame:
is the total energy of the moving object in the lab frame,
is the three dimensional relativistic momentum of the object in the lab frame with magnitude . The relativistic energy and momentum include the Lorentz factor defined by:
Some authors use relativistic mass defined by:
although rest mass has a more fundamental significance, and will be used primarily over relativistic mass in this article.
Squaring the 3-momentum gives:
then solving for and substituting into the Lorentz factor obtains its alternative form in terms of 3-momentum and mass, rather than 3-velocity:
Inserting this form of the Lorentz factor into the energy equation:
followed by more rearrangement yields (). The elimination of the Lorentz factor also eliminates implicit velocity dependence of the particle in (), as well as any inferences to the "relativistic mass" of a massive particle. This approach is not general as massless particles are not considered. Naively setting would mean that and and no energy-momentum relation could be derived, which is not correct.
Norm of the four-momentum.
Special relativity.
In Minkowski space, energy (divided by "c") and momentum are two components of a Minkowski four-vector, namely the four-momentum;
(these are the contravariant components).
The Minkowski inner product of this vector with itself gives the square of the norm of this vector, it is proportional to the square of the rest mass of the body:
a Lorentz invariant quantity, and therefore independent of the frame of reference. Using the Minkowski metric with metric signature , the inner product in tensor index notation and as matrix multiplication can be calculated as:
and so:
which is the energy–momentum relation. If we had the other metric signature for , the inner product would be
and
so:
which is still the same equation, as it should be because the inner product is an invariant.
General relativity.
In general relativity, the 4-momentum is a four-vector defined in a local coordinate frame, although by definition the inner product is similar to that of special relativity,
in which the Minkowski metric is replaced by the metric tensor field "g":
solved from the Einstein field equations. Then:
Performing the summations over indices followed by collecting "timelike", "spacetime-like", and "spacelike" terms gives:
where the factor of 2 arises because the metric is a symmetric tensor, and the convention of Latin indices "i", "j" taking spacelike values 1, 2, 3 is used. As each component of the metric has space and time dependence in general; this is significantly more complicated than the formula quoted at the beginning, see metric tensor (general relativity) for more information.
Units of energy, mass and momentum.
In natural units where , the energy–momentum equation reduces to
In particle physics, energy is typically given in units of electron volts (eV), momentum in units of eV·"c"−1, and mass in units of eV·"c"−2. In electromagnetism, and because of relativistic invariance, it is useful to have the electric field and the magnetic field in the same unit (Gauss), using the cgs (Gaussian) system of units, where energy is given in units of erg, mass in grams (g), and momentum in g·cm·s−1.
Energy may also in theory be expressed in units of grams, though in practice it requires a large amount of energy to be equivalent to masses in this range. For example, the first atomic bomb liberated about 1 gram of heat, and the largest thermonuclear bombs have generated a kilogram or more of heat. Energies of thermonuclear bombs are usually given in tens of kilotons and megatons referring to the energy liberated by exploding that amount of trinitrotoluene (TNT).
Special cases.
Centre-of-momentum frame (one particle).
For a body in its rest frame, the momentum is zero, so the equation simplifies to
where is the rest mass of the body.
Massless particles.
If the object is massless, as is the case for a photon, then the equation reduces to
This is a useful simplification. It can be rewritten in other ways using the de Broglie relations:
if the wavelength or wavenumber are given.
Correspondence principle.
Rewriting the relation for massive particles as:
and expanding into power series by the binomial theorem (or a Taylor series):
in the limit that , we have so the momentum has the classical form , then to first order in (i.e. retain the term for and neglect all terms for ) we have
or
where the second term is the classical kinetic energy, and the first is the rest mass of the particle. This approximation is not valid for massless particles since the expansion required the division of momentum by mass. Incidentally, there are no massless particles in classical mechanics.
Many-particle systems.
Addition of four momenta.
In the case of many particles with relativistic momenta and energy , where (up to the total number of particles) simply labels the particles, as measured in a particular frame, the four-momenta in this frame can be added;
and then take the norm; to obtain the relation for a many particle system:
where is the invariant mass of the whole system, and is not equal to the sum of the rest masses of the particles unless all particles are at rest (see mass in special relativity for more detail). Substituting and rearranging gives the generalization of ();
The energies and momenta in the equation are all frame-dependent, while is frame-independent.
Center-of-momentum frame.
In the center-of-momentum frame (COM frame), by definition we have:
with the implication from () that the invariant mass is also the centre of momentum (COM) mass-energy, aside from the factor:
and this is true for "all" frames since is frame-independent. The energies are those in the COM frame, "not" the lab frame.
Rest masses and the invariant mass.
Either the energies or momenta of the particles, as measured in some frame, can be eliminated using the energy momentum relation for each particle:
allowing to be expressed in terms of the energies and rest masses, or momenta and rest masses. In a particular frame, the squares of sums can be rewritten as sums of squares (and products):
so substituting the sums, we can introduce their rest masses in ():
The energies can be eliminated by:
similarly the momenta can be eliminated by:
where is the angle between the momentum vectors and .
Rearranging:
Since the invariant mass of the system and the rest masses of each particle are frame-independent, the right hand side is also an invariant (even though the energies and momenta are all measured in a particular frame).
Matter waves.
Using the De Broglie relations for energy and momentum
for matter waves of is angular frequency, is the wavevector with magnitude equal to the wave number, the energy–momentum relation can be expressed in terms of wave quantities:
and tidying up by dividing by throughout:
This can also be derived from the magnitude of the four-wavevector
in a similar way to the four-momentum above.
Since the reduced Planck constant and the speed of light both appear and clutter this equation, this is where natural units are especially helpful. Normalizing them so that , we have:

Lowton Churches Romania Appeal

Lowton Churches Romania Appeal is a charity set up by the five churches of Lowton, Greater Manchester, England (St Luke's, St Mary's, St Catherine's, Lane Head Methodist, Lowton Independent Methodist) after the fall of Ceauşescu in 1990. It grew from work of an aid trip arranged by the churches after knowledge of the living conditions in the country's orphanages first became widespread. The aid trip, which saw many Lowtoners travel to Romania by coach, visited an orphanage in Lugoj, west Romania. The trip was successful but barely scratched the surface of the problem and the individuals who travelled decided LCRA should be created to deliver long-term help. Initially more trips to Lugoj and elsewhere were arranged but as time has gone on the charity has grown and expanded its remit. It now has several ongoing projects in the country.
One area in which Lugoj has strong links is in the town of Sinaia. In 2000 LCRA donated an ambulance to the town's hospital in memory of James Dickinson, who travelled on many of the charity's aid trips and was just 18 when he died in 1999. In 2003, a second ambuance was donated in memory of another of the charity's workers, Carol Jones.

Consumer NZ

Consumer NZ, previously known as Consumers' Institute of New Zealand, is an organization that covers a wide range of activities relating to consumer protection and information. Its work includes comparative tests and surveys of consumer goods and services, research into and advice on financial, food, health, safety, welfare and environmental matters, representation at parliamentary committees and public enquiries and an interest in consumer education and complaints advisory work. 
History.
The Consumers’ Council was established in 1959 ‘to protect and promote the interest of consumers of goods and services’. In 1963 the name Consumers Institute was adopted and in 1967 it became a separate government funded entity. In 1986 the Ministry of Consumer Affairs was established and the Consumers Institute lost its special legal protection and government funding. The Consumers Institute became an incorporated society funded by members’ subscriptions in 1989 and in 2007 the Consumers’ Institute was renamed Consumer NZ.
In 2009 the magazine and website had 70,000 subscribers.
The Minister of Consumer Affairs (New Zealand) has cited Consumer NZ as a source of guidance for consumers wanting to understand the Consumer Guarantees Act. 
With the Ministry of Consumer Affairs (New Zealand), Consumer NZ manages Powerswitch, which is a project to assist consumers in evaluating the costs of consuming electricity.
Testing.
Consumer commissions independent laboratories to carry out product tests. Consumer does not accept free goods for testing or sponsorship. The magazine is completely independent and has no ties with any commercial firm or organisation. Their membership of Consumers International means they benefit from an exchange of information with consumer organisations around the world.
The organization does not permit any marketer to use its test results to promote their products.
The organization has been criticized for emphasizing shortcomings in nursing homes, with health care workers saying that Consumers NZ demands more from health care services than it is reasonable to expect.
The Board.
Consumer NZ is governed by an elected board of seven members who hold office for three years. The current chair is Nicola Wills. The deputy chair is Richard Aston. As part of Consumers’ work on behalf of all NZ consumers, they regularly make submissions to Government and statutory authorities on a wide range of issues affecting consumers.
Consumers' money comes from the sale of publications and subscriptions to "Consumer" and consumer.org.nz. When a customer subscribes to Consumer magazine or consumer.org.nz they become a member of Consumer NZ (unless they request otherwise) and have the right to nominate and vote for Board members. The style of the magazine has been critiqued and described as a "distinctive authorial" presentation.

Qiang (spear)

Qiang () is the Chinese term for spear. Due to its relative ease of manufacture, the spear in many variations was ubiquitous on the pre-modern Chinese battlefield. It is known as one of the four major weapons, along with the "Gun (staff)", "Dao (sabre)", and the "Jian (sword)", called in this group "The King of Weapons".
Common features of the Chinese spear are the leaf shaped blade and red horse-hair tassel lashed just below. The tassel shows elite troop status. It also serves a tactical purpose. [[Image:10th all china games Qiang 928.jpg|thumb|left|Qiang event at the 
10th All China Games]]When the spear is moving quickly, the addition of the tassel aids in blurring the vision of the opponent so that it is more difficult for them to grab the shaft of spear behind the head or tip. The tassel also served another purpose, to stop the flow of blood from the blade getting to the wooden shaft (the blood would make it slippery, or sticky when dried). The length varied from around 9 feet long, increasing up to 21 feet. According to general Qi Jiguang, the Ming military categorized spears above 9 feet as short spears, 14 feet as long spears, and spears below 9 feet as spiked staffs, which were used more for hitting than stabbing. Spears used in war are typically made of hard wood. 
Martial arts (wushu) spears are typically made of wax wood, a lighter and more flexible wood better suited for performance; these are called flower spears.
Many Chinese martial arts feature spear training in their curriculum. The conditioning provided by spear technique is seen as invaluable and in many styles it is the first weapons training introduced to students. Moreover, some schools of empty handed fighting in China credit spear technique as their foundation, notably Xingyiquan and Bajiquan.

Álvaro Parente

Álvaro Parente (born 4 October 1984 in Porto) is a Portuguese racecar driver. He is currently under contract with McLaren racing their GT cars for several customer teams.
Career.
Early career.
After winning the Karting European Junior Championship in 1998, Parente made his debut in auto racing in 2001 at the age of 16, driving in the Spanish F3 Championship. In the following year, he was integrated into the Team Portugal project and scored a win on his way to 4th place in the series.
Formula Three.
Parente than began a more international career in 2003, moving to the F3 Euroseries with Team Ghinzani, but the Mugen-Honda engine proved to be inferior to the Mercedes and he scored a single point. He did better with one-off entries in Italian Formula 3 and at Spa in a round of the British Formula 3 Championship, his first association with Carlin Motorsport, which was repeated that year in the Macau Grand Prix.
This brief contact paved the way for a contract with Carlin for the 2004 season, where he took part in the British series, scoring another win and finishing 7th in the championship standings. He also took part in the Marlboro Masters and at Macau, but in the former the Mugen-Honda could not take the fight to the Mercedes drivers and in the latter he was taken out in the first lap.
Parente stayed in the British Formula Three for another season, and his experience helped him to win the championship with four races to go, scoring a total of 11 wins. This result made him the natural candidate to represent A1 Team Portugal for the new A1 Grand Prix series.
Formula Renault 3.5 Series.
For 2006, Parente joined the Formula Renault 3.5 Series with the Victory Engineering team, and achieved his first win at Istanbul in only his fifth race in the category. He took two further wins at the Nürburgring and Circuit de Catalunya to finish fifth in the final standings. He had hoped to progress onto the GP2 Series in 2007, but a lack of sponsorship scuppered his plans. He did, however, return to the Formula Renault 3.5 Series with the French Tech 1 Racing team, having signed a contract on the eve of the first pre-season test.
During the 2007 season Parente took five podium finishes, including two race victories at Monaco and Spa, and was crowned World Series by Renault champion at the final round in Barcelona on 27 October.
As a prize for winning the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, Parente has tested for the Renault F1 team on 17 January 2008 at the Circuito de Jerez.
GP2 Series.
For 2008 Parente moved to the Super Nova Racing team in the GP2 Series, widely regarded as the primary feeder series to Formula One.
Alvaro Parente made a stunning start to his GP2 career in the opening round of the season at the Circuit de Catalunya, Parente won the feature race making him the first Portuguese driver to win in GP2 Series. Alvaro Parente led from start to finish, to claim victory ahead of Bruno Senna and Andreas Zuber. He eventually finished eighth in the drivers' championship.
Super Nova team nicknamed Parente as "Chachi", due to his likeness to the famous character in Happy Days.
In 2009 Parente participated in the GP2 Asia Series with My Team Qi.Meritus, and competed in the GP2 Series with Ocean Racing Technology, finishing eighth once again.
Parente began the 2010 season without a drive, but replaced Alberto Valerio at the Coloni team from the Belgian round onwards. On his return to the category, he scored a double podium finish, and ended the weekend as the highest scoring driver. He was replaced for the final round by James Jakes.
Parente again went into the 2011 GP2 Series season without a drive, but was called up by Racing Engineering for the second round of the championship at Catalunya. He replaced Christian Vietoris, who had complained of recurring headaches following a heavy crash at the first round in Turkey. Vietoris returned after two rounds, but Parente remained in the series by switching to the Carlin team, where he took the seat previously occupied by Oliver Turvey. After a further six races, he relinquished the seat to Mikhail Aleshin. He then returned for the season finale at Monza, ending up in 16th place in the drivers' championship.
Superleague Formula.
Parente agreed to race at the 2009 Estoril round of the 2009 Superleague Formula season for his football squad team, F.C. Porto, and went on to win the second race, on his series debut.
Formula One.
Parente was a leading contender for a seat at Campos Meta, other contenders were Vitaly Petrov and Pastor Maldonado.
On 15 December 2009, it was officially announced that Parente would join the new Virgin Racing team as a test driver. However, he was not present at the launch of the VR-01 chassis in February 2010, and it was reported that he had left the team due to sponsorship problems. Andy Soucek replaced Parente as the reserve driver.

Jumpers

Jumpers is a play by Tom Stoppard which was first performed in 1972. It explores and satirises the field of academic philosophy, likening it to a less-than skilful competitive gymnastics display. "Jumpers" raises questions such as "What do we know?" and "Where do values come from?" It is set in an alternative reality where some British astronauts have landed on the moon and "Radical Liberals" (read pragmatists and relativists) have taken over the British government (the play seems to suggest that pragmatists and relativists would be immoral (Archie says that murder is not wrong, merely "antisocial")). It was inspired by the notion that a manned moon landing would ruin the moon as a poetic trope and possibly lead to a collapse of moral values.
The play was first performed by the National Theatre Company at the Old Vic Theatre, London on 2 February 1972 with Michael Hordern and Diana Rigg in the leading roles of George and Dorothy. Peter Wood directed the original production and Carl Toms designed its sets and costumes.
The play premiered on Broadway on April 22, 1974 at the Billy Rose Theatre and closed on June 1, 1974 after 48 performances. Directed again by Peter Wood, it featured Brian Bedford and Jill Clayburgh. Bedford won the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Performance. 
A revival directed for the Royal National Theatre by David Leveaux opened in London's Lyttelton Theatre on June 19, 2003 and transferred to Broadway on April 25, 2004 at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre and closed on July 11, 2004 after 89 performances and 23 previews. The Broadway show featured Simon Russell Beale and Essie Davis. The play received a Tony Award nomination for Best play revival.

Absurd Person Singular

Absurd Person Singular is a 1972 play by Alan Ayckbourn. Divided into three acts, it documents the changing fortunes of three married couples. Each act takes place at a Christmas celebration at one of the couples' homes on successive Christmas Eves.
Production history.
The play made its world premiere at the Library Theatre, Scarborough on 26 June 1972 and its London début at the Criterion Theatre on 4 July 1973, transferring to the Vaudeville Theatre in September 1974, completing a run of 973 performances.

The BBC produced a television drama, adapted from the play, first broadcast on 1 January 1985. It was directed by Michael Simpson and starred John Baddeley, Cheryl Campbell, Michael Gambon, Nicky Henson, Lesley Joseph, Maureen Lipman, Geoffrey Palmer and Prunella Scales.
The play was revived in the West End at the Whitehall Theatre, May 1990; and at the Garrick Theatre in December 2007.
A new production was staged during May 2011 at the new Curve Theatre in Leicester, starring Tracy-Ann Oberman and Louise Plowright and directed by Paul Kerryson.
The play was revived once again at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough – 40 years after its original run there, in 2012.
Characters.
Sidney.
A contractor eager for social and professional advancement, Sidney will do anything to impress his perceived superiors—at the expense of his dignity and marriage. Sidney is socially inept, and shares that innocence with his wife, keeping their marriage together. As the play progresses, he becomes wealthier and wealthier, until eventually the friends he was once desperate to impress are now courting him as their own fortunes sink lower and lower. By the final act success has transformed Sidney's innocence into something approaching macabre sadism: in the earlier acts, the other couples view him with indulgent contempt and tolerate his childishness, but as the play progresses and he acquires money and power, they find themselves compelled to take him much more seriously, until self-preservation dictates they play along with his games.
Jane.
Jane is the most sympathetic character in this piece. Sidney's loyal wife, she's not much brighter than he is, but she's equally eager to please. Unlike Marion and Eva, she also has a knack for the housework in which she takes refuge from the complexity and difficulty of the world. She takes most of her social cues from her husband and would do almost anything to help him succeed, but isn't motivated by greed or social standing: she just wants a comfortable living and a happy family.
Geoffrey.
An architect by trade, Geoffrey is initially on the way up, only to fall from grace after a design fails and collapses between the second and third acts. A confident man and something of a Jack-the-Lad, he has many casual affairs and could be said to flaunt it. His indifference towards his wife Eva may have led to her addiction to anti-depressants, and even to cause her suicide attempts in the second act. However, by the third act, he is an utterly broken man: his confidence and charisma have been dashed by his career grinding to a halt, and the prospect of Sidney being the last man on earth willing to hire him doesn't thrill him very much, either.
Eva.
Geoffrey's wife. Eva's appearance in the first act is brief and whimsical, establishing only her addiction to anti-depressants and her difficulties with her husband Geoffrey. She comes into her own in the second act, as a very depressed Eva tries repeatedly to kill herself, growing more and more desperate to end it all even as the other characters prevent her from doing so. By the third act she has recovered, dispensed with her addiction to pain-killers, and appears to be teetotal (or at least a much lighter drinker, refusing alcohol even though she's not driving). She has also taken control of her relationship with Geoffrey, setting the course for his business and forcing him into situations he has typically charmed his way out of but which are now unavoidable. By the end of the play she is in perhaps the best position, being in control of her life and her relationship, neither warped by success nor embittered by failure, though she clearly has many practical challenges to overcome.
Ronald.
An aging banker, Ronald takes pride in his work and enjoys the finer things in life. More conservative than the other characters, he is wry and sardonic. Initially both indulgent and disdainful of Sidney and Jane—although casually admiring Geoffrey—he is something of a side show in the second act and by the third act is clearly in severe financial trouble, unable to afford even to heat his house. Although he tries to maintain a facade of cheerful aristocratic bluster, his nerves show through, and he is forced to submit to Sidney as the holder of a large business account in Ronald's bank. (In fact, it is implied that Sidney is Ronald's only remaining significant client.)
Marion.
Ronald's second wife is charming though snobbish and deeply eccentric. As the play advances more and more of her eccentricities are attributed to alcoholism, climaxing in her thoroughly drunk presence in the third act. Her main role in the play is to reflect and magnify the position of the taciturn Ronald, making his path from polite disdain of Sidney to impoverished failure more clearly elucidated than Ronald's naturally reserved personality would allow.

The Rugby League Victory Cup is a rugby league tournament held in Russia between its national team and those of France, the USA and a British amateur side. Officially it is organised and funded by the Russian Rugby Football League (RRFL); unofficially, the 2003 and 2004 tournaments were largely run by the RRFL's then president, Akhmet Kamaldinov, who had more to do with the organisation and especially the funding then any other person employed by the RRFL.
The Tournament was initially dedicated to the anniversary of the "Victory" of World War II. All teams competing in the first two competitions were allies during the war. 
With Kamaldinov departing as president of the RRFL in early 2005, the Victory Cup underwent some major adjustment. The tournament is to be held as a sevens tournament and has been renamed to the Victory Sevens. It was hoped that the tournament be named the World Sevens since the demise of that competition just a year or two ago. Those plans have seem to have fallen through.

Legio I Maximiana

The Legio I "Maximiana" ("of Maximian") was a comitatensis Roman legion, probably created in the year 296 or 297 by the Emperor Diocletian.
The I "Maximiana" was formed together with II "Flavia Constantia", to garrison the newly created province Thebaidos, in Aegyptus. The legion is also known as Maximiana Thebanorum or Thebaeorum ("Maximian legion of the Thebans"). Since no Legio I "Maximiana" is listed as being stationed at Thebes in the "Notitia Dignitatum", the designation is interpreted more broadly as of the Thebaid in general. The cognomen "Maximiana" originated from Maximian, Diocletian's colleague. 
In 354, I "Maximiana" was in Thrace, in the neighborhood of Adrianople (modern Edirne). Thus it is likely that it fought in the Battle of Adrianople, in 378, when emperor Valens was defeated by Goths. According to "Notitia Dignitatum", the I "Maximiana Thebanorum" was still under Thracian command ("magister militum per Thracias") at the beginning of the 5th century, while the I "Maximiana" was in Philae (Egypt, south of Aswan), under the "dux Thebaidos".
There exists also a purely legendary Theban Legion in the legend of Saint Maurice from the 5th century. According to that tradition, this ("Prima Maximiana Thebanorum") was a legion from Thebes that was ordered to move by Maximian. Thus it is sometimes related to I "Maximiana Thebanorum". However, according to tradition, the Theban Legion of Saint Maurice was martyred in 286, while the I "Maximiana" was not founded until ten years later.

International Research and Training Centre for Rural Education

The International Research and Training Centre for Rural Education (INRULED) is a training and research centre located in the People's Republic of China. The main sponsors of INRULED are the Chinese government and UNESCO.
INRULED’s headquarters are located at Beijing Normal University, where the Centre's secretariat is located. It also has a base at Baoding, Hebei Province, located 130 km south of Beijing. An Associate Centre is located at the School of Education of the Nanjing Normal University and also at the Gansu Institute of Educational Research. INRULED conducts research and training in the area of rural education in line with the aims of the Education-for-All programme.
The International Research and Training Centre for Rural Education (INRULED) with its explicit focus on rural education is unique. It was formed in the latter part of 1994 through a Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and UNESCO. The Centre is commissioned to undertake the following functions:
The overall planning and execution of programmes and activities of the Centre are supervised, monitored and evaluated by the Government of the People’s Republic of China through its National Commission for UNESCO, in co-operation with UNESCO through their Cluster Office in Beijing.
The World Education Forum held in Dakar in April 2000 reaffirmed the critical role education plays for poverty reduction (UNESCO, 2000). Programmes and activities organised by INRULED during the last ten years reflect clearly its fundamental emphasis on the development of better understanding of education, which is a key tool for reducing poverty and improving the lives of rural people, particularly of people who live in the developing and least developed countries. 
Over the years INRULED has initiated and facilitated a wide range of programmes and activities focused on rural education which have direct bearing on rural development and poverty reduction with linkages to the mid-term and biennium programmes of UNESCO in literacy, continuing education and primary education within the broader framework of Education-for-All (EFA). INRULED is inclusive in these programmes and activities in that it has involved practitioners and specialists from around the World with particular emphasis on South-South participation and collaboration. The products and outcomes of these activities are significant and have resulted in many valuable publications (paper and electronic) and informal networking of a wide range of institutions and professionals whose work focus on development of education in rural areas in developing countries.
Since its inception, three International Advisory Board Meetings were convened and three external evaluation missions were mounted (1999, 2001 and 2003). In February 2009 a new management board was established.

Souvenir (play)

Souvenir is a two-character play, with incidental music, by Stephen Temperley.
<br>Set in a Greenwich Village supper club in 1964, it flashes back to the musical career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a wealthy socialite with a famously uncertain sense of pitch and key. In 1932, she met mediocre pianist Cosmé McMoon, and the two teamed up in the hope of achieving success. Over the next dozen years, their bizarre partnership yielded hilariously off-key recitals that became the talk of New York, earned them cultish fame, and culminated in a sold-out performance at Carnegie Hall in 1944.
The play was showcased by the off-Broadway York Theatre Company in 2004. After fourteen previews, the Broadway production, directed by Vivian Matalon (who originally suggested the subject matter to Temperley), opened on November 10, 2005 at the Lyceum Theatre, where it ran for 68 performances. Judy Kaye and Donald Corren comprised the cast. Kaye was nominated for both the Tony and Drama Desk Award for her performance.
The Lyric Stage Company of Boston staged "Souvenir" in early 2007 - their production featured direction by Spiro Veloudous, and starred Leigh Barret as Jenkins, with Will McGarrahan as Cosme. The San Jose Repertory Theater staged the West-Coast premiere of "Souvenir" in their 2007-2008 season; with Mark Anders playing Cosme McMoon and Patti Cohenour playing Florence Foster Jenkins.

<doc id="2875772" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2875772" title="Wheatland Ferry">
Wheatland Ferry

The Wheatland Ferry is a cable ferry that connects Marion County and Yamhill County across the Willamette River in the U.S. state of Oregon. The ferry travels approximately 580 feet (178 meters) across the river, depending on the height of the river, and is powered by two electric motors connected to an on-board diesel generator. The ferry is supported by two steel cables, one under water on the downriver side, and one overhead on the upriver side. The ferry also uses the overhead cable for steering.
Each time a replacement Wheatland ferry is launched, it is always named "Daniel Matheny", after the person who originally established the ferry, followed by its number as a Roman numeral. The current ferry, launched in 2002 is "Daniel Matheny V". This most recent ferry differs from its predecessors in that it has a capacity of nine cars, rather than the six "Daniel Matheny IV" carried, and it has its own self-contained diesel-electric generator. As its source of electricity is now an onboard generator, the current ferry is no longer reliant on electricity from overhead wires. The overhead cable serves the sole purpose of bracing the ferry against the current.
The ferry is a joint operation of Marion and Yamhill counties, with Marion County taking the responsibility of staffing and operating the ferry. It operates every day that river conditions permit. In summer, low water levels can cause the ferry to bottom out. Dredging is sometimes employed to deepen the ferry's crossing lane to keep it operating longer during the dry season. During rainy months, high water levels and fast currents can stop ferry operations.
All vehicles must pay a toll. Pedestrians travel at no charge.
Location.
The Wheatland Ferry is located at Willamette River mile 72, near the former community of Wheatland and Willamette Mission State Park and roughly between the cities of Salem and Newberg. Its location is strategic, because the nearest bridge in either direction is roughly 15 miles distant. The Wheatland Ferry is sometimes used as an alternative to the bridge which crosses the Willamette River in Salem.
History.
The first Daniel Matheny ferry was started by Daniel Matheny himself, in the 1850s. The ferry was a wooden raft powered by men with wooden poles.
The current ferry was built at Mar Com Shipyard in Portland Oregon in 2001.
Controversy.
The Wheatland Ferry has been a catalyst for local political controversy. Some of this is the natural result of the challenges of inter-county politics and budget issues. Motorists who frequently use the ferry are another factor, citing long wait times, frequent closures for maintenance and increasing prices. Because of its proximity to Salem, the state's capital and second largest city, political and practical issues over Salem's own bridge issues affect the Wheatland Ferry.
Additional concerns about the ferry's operation were raised after the ferry operator was found to be intoxicated while running the ferry on November 4, 2012.
Ridership.
The estimated annual number of vehicle crossings for 2007 was 240,000. While Yamhill and Marion counties are trying to increase ridership, the wait for the ferry can be lengthy at peak times. During harvest seasons, the ferry is frequently used by farmers delivering produce to canneries across the river.

<doc id="2875779" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2875779" title="Atropates">
Atropates

Atropates (Greek Aτρoπάτης, from Old Persian "Aturpat" "protected by fire"; c. 370 BC – after 321 BC) was a Persian nobleman who served Darius III, then Alexander the Great, and eventually founded an independent kingdom and dynasty that was named after him. Diodorus (18.4) refers to him as 'Atrapes', while Quintus Curtius (8.3.17) erroneously names him 'Arsaces'.
Biography.
Towards the end of the Achaemenid Empire, Atropates was governor ("satrap") of the Achaemenid province of Media. In the decisive Battle of Gaugamela (October 331 BCE) between Darius and Alexander, Atropates commanded the Achaemenid troops of Media, Caucasian Albania and Sacasene (part of present-day Armenia).
Following his defeat in that battle, Darius fled to the Median capital of Ecbatana, where Atropates gave him hospitality. Darius attempted to raise a new army but was forced to flee Ecbatana in June 330 BCE. After Darius' death a month later at the hands of Bessus, Atropates surrendered to Alexander. Alexander initially chose Oxydates as satrap of Media, but in 328-327 BCE after Alexander lost trust in Oxydates' loyalty, Atropates was reinstated to his old position. In 325-324, Atropates delivered Baryaxes (a sought-after rebel of the region) to Alexander while the latter was at Pasargadae. Alexander's esteem for the governor rose "so high" that soon afterwards Atropates' daughter was married to Alexander's confidant and cavalry commander Perdiccas at the famous mass wedding at Susa in February 324 BCE.
Later that year, Alexander visited Atropates in Ecbatana with his good friend and second-in-command Hephaestion, who fell ill and died in October 324 BCE. At this time, "was related by some authors, that Atropates on one occasion presented Alexander with a hundred women, said to be Amazons; but Arrian ([Anabasis vii. 13) disbelieved the story."
Alexander himself died eight months later on June 10, 323 BCE, and Atropates' new son-in-law Perdiccas was named regent of Alexander's half-brother Philip III. Following the "Partition of Babylon" in 323 BCE, Media was divided into two parts: the greater portion in the south-east was to be governed by Peithon, a general of Perdiccas, while a smaller portion in the north west (principally around the Araxes River basin was given to Atropates. At some point thereafter, Atropates refused to convey allegiance to the diadochi and made his part of Media an independent kingdom, while his son-in-law Perdiccas was eventually murdered by Peithon in the summer of 320 BCE.
Legacy.
The dynasty Atropates founded would rule the kingdom for several centuries, at first either independendantly or as vassals of the Seleucids, then as vassals of the Arsacids, into whose house they are said to have married. They became, however, the new House of Parthia through the marriage of the Arsacid heiress to the Atropatenid heir.
The region that encompassed Atropates' kingdom come to be known to the Greeks as "Media Atropatene" after Atropates, and eventually simply "Atropatene". The Arsacids called it 'Aturpatakan' in Parthian, as did also the Sassanids who eventually succeeded them. Eventually Middle Iranian 'Aturpatakan' became 'Azerbaijan', whence, according to one etymological theory, the modern nation of Azerbaijan and the Iranian province of Azerbaijan (which province is largely contiguous with the borders of ancient Atropatene) got their names; another theory traces the etymology from the ancient Persian words "Āzar" (), meaning "Fire", and "Pāyegān" () meaning "Guardian/Protector" (Āzar Pāyegān = "Guardians of Fire") (), with Āzar Pāyegān later becoming corrupted to 'Azerbaijan' under the dominance of Arabic and the circumstances thereby imposed by that language's lack of facility in producing or pronouncing "G / P / ZH / CH".

Well (play)

Well is a play by Lisa Kron. It concerns relationships between mothers and daughters and "wellness", among other themes. It ran Off-Broadway in 2004 and then on Broadway in 2006.
Production history.
"Well" premiered Off-Broadway at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, opening on March 16, 2004 (previews) and running to May 16, 2004. Directed by Leigh Silverman, the cast starred Lisa Kron and Jayne Houdyshell as Lisa's mother, Ann Kron. The Public Theater production garnered "Best of 2004" lists in "The New York Times" among other publications. 
"Well" next ran at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco in February and March 2005, with Kron and Houdyshell.
The play opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on March 10, 2006 in previews, officially on March 30, and closed on May 14, 2006 after 23 previews and 52 performances. Directed by Leigh Silverman, Lisa Kron and Jayne Houdyshell repeated their roles from the Off-Broadway production. According to "Playbill", it "opened to some of the best reviews for any play this season."
The play was performed by the Huntington Theater Company at the Boston University Theater in March 2007, with Kron and Mary Pat Gleason as her mother and at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in their 2010 season, running February to June 2010. 
"Well" premiered in London at the Trafalgar Studios 2, from 4 September 2008 (previews) to 27 September 2008 and transferred to the Apollo Theatre, London, from 29 December 2008 (previews), 30 December 2008 (official opening) and closed 24 January 2009 after 32 performances. The cast starred Natalie Casey as Lisa Kron and Sarah Miles as her mother, with direction by Eve Leigh.
Overview.
Lisa Kron presents her intended play about mothers and daughters, "illness" and "wellness". The character of Lisa begins the "play": "This play is not about my mother and me." Ann Kron, Lisa's mother, is a semi-invalid. As the "play" progresses, Lisa tries to discuss her past in Michigan and her mother. However, Ann corrects Lisa's version of their past and the other actors leave their assigned roles and instead talk with Ann about her life.
Critical reception.
Ben Brantley, in his review for "The New York Times", wrote "What makes 'Well' much more than a clever, deconstructed theatrical riff is the way it keeps surprising itself with glimpses of an emotional depth, both murky and luminous, that goes beyond any tidy narrative."
Awards and nominations.
Kron (Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play) and Houdyshell (Best Featured Actress in a Play) received 2006 Tony Award nominations. Houdyshell also was nominated for the Drama Desk Award, Outer Critics Circle Award and Lucille Lortel Award, and won the Obie Award, Outstanding Performance. The play was nominated for the Outer Critics Circle Award as Outstanding Off-Broadway Play.

Legio II Flavia Constantia

The Legio II "Flavia Constantia" ("reliable Flavian legion") was a comitatensis Roman legion, created by Diocletian, probably in the year 296 or 297.
II "Flavia Constantia" was formed together with I "Maximiana" to garrison the newly created province Thebaidos, Aegyptus. The name of the legion is related to Constantius Chlorus, who reigned over the eastern part of the empire. II "Flavia Constantia" had its headquarters in Cusas ("Not. Or." XXXI) until the time of the "Notitia Dignitatum". In the course of time, probably under Constantine I, when the troops of the Egyptian provinces were united under the command of a "dux" (CIL II 12073), the legionary troops of the province were increased with units from both legions of Aegyptus I "Iovia", II "Traiana", and III "Diocletiana", the latter gradually being divided into three garrisons ("Not. or." XXXI 31. 33. 38).
II "Flavia Constantia Thebaeorum", which belonged at the time of the "Notitia" to the comitatus of the "magister militum per Orientem" ("Not. or." VII 10 = 45), was certainly spilt off from II "Flavia Constantia", which was for more than a century established as border-legion. The impulse for this split was probably given by a measure of Theodosius I, to mix a part of the Barbarians, which were passed over to him, with the troops in Egypt. These barbarians were added to the Egyptian troops and their accompanying commander in Macedonia (Zosimus IV 30 and 31), who resided at that time in Thessalonica. A part of II "Flavia Constantia" belonged to these "Aiguptioi" (Egyptians). It is fitting that at this time the legion II "Flavia Valentis Thebaeorum" ("Not or." VII 11 = 46), which accompanied the troops in the Notitia and was named after and probably raised by Emperor Valens, was no longer mentioned with the garrison of Thebaidos ("Not. or." XXXI), because of the short time it stayed in the province.

Lennon (musical)

Lennon is a musical with music and lyrics by John Lennon and book by Don Scardino, who also directed its premiere. The musical is about the life of John Lennon and was notable for Scardino's choice to be almost exclusively based on Lennon's own words and to focus on Lennon's solo career, with no songs from the Lennon–McCartney catalogue.
The "$7 million bio-musical" first opened in San Francisco, California in April 2005. After what "The Times" described as "a troubled try-out in San Francisco, a cancelled run in Boston and a radical rewrite", it had 42 previews and 49 performances on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre from August 14 to September 24, 2005. The role of Lennon is played by performers of both sexes and different ages and skin colors, an approach Scardino said was inspired by "I Am the Walrus" where Lennon writes, "I am he, as you are he, as you are me, and we are all together." This use of multiple actors was scaled back after the San Francisco production, with the final rewrite having a single actor narrating Lennon's story.
Yoko Ono was actively involved in the production, retaining final script approval and requiring the show's Broadway producers to complete the script and present it to her live (albeit in workshop format). The show's credits included the phrase "With Special Thanks to Yoko Ono Lennon"; Ono was frequently seen at the theatre during the show's Broadway run.
The limited use of Beatles songs, attributed to creative choices and not licensing issues, led critics to dismiss the work as “Ono-centric”. Ono was unapologetic about the choice: "If we put "Yesterday" in, it's not really fair to the Beatles because we're leaning on their power. We're talking about John now, thank you." She later said “It is definitely John’s story — from Liverpool 1940 to New York 1980. I am the B-side, and that’s how it should be. I think he would have loved it.” The musical also conspicuously omitted any mention of May Pang, Lennon's lover for a period of 18 months in the years 1974-75 when the singer was separated from Ono.
Broadway opening.
The Broadway production went into previews on July 7, 2005, opened August 14, 2005, in which it ran for forty-one days, and closed on September 24 of the same year.
The Broadway premiere was produced by Edgar Lansbury (who conceived the show and brought in Scardino), Clear Channel Entertainment and Jeffrey Sine.
The opening night cast of "Lennon" included Will Chase (who as narrator was the "lead" John Lennon), Chuck Cooper, Julie Danao-Salkin, Mandy Gonzalez, Marcy Harriell, Chad Kimball, Terrence Mann, Julia Murney, Michael Potts, Rona Figueroa, Mark Richard Ford, Nicole Lewis and Darin Murphy.
The show opened to awful reviews, with Ben Brantley of "The New York Times" stating:
In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, "Aieeeee!" A fierce primal scream - of the kind Ms. Ono is famous for as a performance and recording artist - is surely the healthiest response to the agony of "Lennon," the jerry-built musical shrine that opened last night at the Broadhurst Theater.
"Playbill" quoted Paul Shaffer in its coverage of the musical's opening night:
I just thought it was phenomenal. It reminded me of what an influence John was — how strong an influence he was not only in popular music but in culture, and how much we miss him. He was a remarkable writer. He'd do catchy so you loved the song right away, then the second time you would hear more of it. Let's face it: the more you listen to his music, the more you hear. I'm still learning things when I hear his songs.
Songs.
The musical includes two previously unpublished songs by Lennon: "India, India" and "I Don't Want to Lose You". A December 2004 "Playbill" article mentioned that the rarely heard Lennon song "Cookin' (in the Kitchen of Love)" (heard on the "Ringo's Rotogravure" album by Ringo Starr) would also be included, though the song was cut before the musical's Broadway opening.

Eastern Technical High School

Eastern Technical High School is a 1997, 2009, and 2010 Maryland Blue Ribbon High School a 2010 National Blue Ribbon High School, and a 1999 USDE New American High School located in Essex, Baltimore County, Maryland. Along with their regular classes, students enrolled at this magnet school participate in a career major of their choosing. Academic areas include Allied Health, Automotive Technology, Business Management and Finance, Construction Management, Culinary Arts, Engineering Careers, Information Technology, Law Related Careers, Multimedia Communications and the Teacher Academy of Maryland. The school also features a variety of sports teams for both girls and boys. In addition the school offers clubs, National Honor Society, Science Honor Society, a concert band, and yearly drama productions.
Eastern Technical High School (ETHS) used to be known as Eastern Vocational Technical High School (EVT, Eastern Voc-Tech), but due to lack of participation in the vocational program and an increased demand for technology education, the vocational program was removed and the school renamed in 1994. Unlike the other high schools in the area, Eastern Tech is not districted - it is not a "home" high school for any students regardless of location. All students must apply and meet certain standards for acceptance to the school.
Attendance.
Eastern Technical High School is often noted for the exceedingly high attendance rate of its students. In recent years, the school has maintained a daily attendance rate of 97 percent.
Academic performance.
Students at the school consistently perform at high academic levels. In 2006, Eastern Tech had the highest pass rate in Baltimore County of the High School Assessments in Algebra, Biology, English, and Government. Over 20 percent of the student body participate in Advanced Placement programs, and over 80 percent of those students achieve a passing grade on the AP exams.
On June 19, 2011, Newsweek Magazine ranks Eastern Tech as the #131 school in the nation, tops in Baltimore County.
Athletics.
Eastern Technical High School is known for the success of several of its sports teams.
In 2005 the Varsity Baseball Team won the school's first ever State Championship and just a few months later the Girls Varsity Soccer Team Won the second. 
Eastern Tech lacks a 400 meter track as well as the number of fields that many high schools have and, as a result, many teams practice on other campuses around the Essex area, such as the neighboring Kenwood High School or CCBC Essex. The school's mascot is the Maverick. The school colors are orange and black.
State Championships
Career majors.
Although no longer a vocational school, all students attending the school have a career major class during their sophomore, junior, and senior years. The majors offered at Eastern are: Allied Health, Automotive, Business and Administration, Communications/Multimedia and Design, Construction, Culinary, Engineering, Information Technology, Law Related Careers, and Teaching Education. In previous years some programs such as the Engineering major required students to begin career major classes in their freshman year. However that practice has recently been abandoned to give all students a chance to experience the "swing". This course allows students to spend a few weeks at a time in classes pertaining to each major in order to aid in their career choice. All 9th graders have to go through the swing in order to receive their Technology Credit as required by the state. In the present, Eastern Technical High School remains a Blue Ribbon School. "A School Like No Other."
Leadership.
Raymond G. Pluemer served as the first principal for Eastern Voc-Tech high school which first opened its doors in 1970; a role he served in until his retirement in 1991. Robert J. Kemmery served as school's second principal from 1991-2002. Patrick McCusker was the school's third principal from 2002-2007. The principal since 2007 is Thomas G. Evans.

Ayr (Scottish Parliament constituency)

Ayr is a constituency of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood). It elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the plurality (first past the post) method of election. Also, however, it is one of nine constituencies in the South Scotland electoral region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to nine constituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole.
Electoral region.
The other eight constituencies of the South Scotland region are Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley, Clydesdale, Dumfriesshire, East Lothian, Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Galloway and West Dumfries, Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley and Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale.
The region covers the Dumfries and Galloway council area, part of the East Ayrshire council area, part of the East Lothian council area, part of the Midlothian council area, the Scottish Borders council area, the South Ayrshire council area and part of the South Lanarkshire council area.
Constituency boundaries and council area.
The Ayr constituency was created at the same time as the Scottish Parliament, in 1999, with the name and boundaries of an existing Westminster constituency. In 2005, however, Scottish Westminster (House of Commons) constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies.
The rest of South Ayrshire is covered by the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency.
Following their First Periodic review into constituencies to the Scottish Parliament in time for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the Boundary Commission for Scotland recommended alterations to the existing Ayr constituency.

Joseph Huntley

Joseph Huntley was a 19th-century biscuit maker and innovator, who lived in the English town of Reading. In 1822 he founded a small biscuit baker and confectioner shop at number 72 London Street.
Business.
At this time, London Street was the main stage coach route from London to Bristol, Bath and the West Country. One of the main calling points of the stage coaches was the Crown Inn, opposite Joseph Huntley's shop and he started selling his biscuits to the travellers on the coaches. Because the biscuits were vulnerable to breakage on the coach journey, he started putting them in a metal tin. Out of this innovation grew two businesses: Joseph (the elders) biscuit shop that was to become the famous biscuit manufacturer Huntley & Palmers, and Huntley, Bourne and Stevens, a firm of biscuit tin manufacturers founded by his younger son, also called Joseph. In 1838, Joseph Huntley was forced by ill-health to retire, handing control of the shop to his older son Thomas.

CD23

CD23, also known as Fc epsilon RII, or FcεRII, is the "low-affinity" receptor for IgE, an antibody isotype involved in allergy and resistance to parasites, and is important in regulation of IgE levels. Unlike many of the antibody receptors, CD23 is a C-type lectin. It is found on mature B cells, activated macrophages, eosinophils, follicular dendritic cells, and platelets.
There are two forms of CD23: CD23a and CD23b. CD23a is present on follicular B cells, whereas CD23b requires IL-4 to be expressed on T-cells, monocytes, Langerhans cells, eosinophils, and macrophages.
Function.
CD23 is known to have role of transportation in antibody feedback regulation. Antigen that enters the blood stream is captured by antigen specific IgE antibodies. The IgE immune complexes that are formed bind to CD23 molecules on B cells, and are transported to the B cell follicles of the spleen. The antigen is then transferred from CD23+ B cells to CD11c+ antigen presenting cells. The CD11c+ cells in turn present the antigen to CD4+ T cells, which can lead to an enhanced antibody response.
Clinical significance.
The allergen responsible in dust mite allergy Der-p-1 is known to cleave CD23 from a cells surface. As CD23 is soluble, it can move freely and interact with cells in plasma. Recent studies have shown that increased levels of soluble CD23 cause the recruitment of non-sensitised B-cells in the presentation of antigen peptides to allergen-specific B-cells, therefore increasing the production of allergen specific IgE. IgE, in turn, is known to upregulate the cellular expression of CD23 and Fc epsilon RI (high-affinity IgE receptor). 
In flow cytometry, CD23 is helpful in the differentiation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CD23-positive) from mantle cell leukemia (CD23-negative). CD23 can also be demonstrated in germinal centre B-cells using immunohistochemistry, but it is not present in the resting cells of the surrounding mantle zone. Lymphomas arising from the mantle zone are generally negative for CD23, but most B-cell chronic lymphomocytic leukaemias and low-grade B-cell lymphomas are positive, allowing immunohistochemistry to distinguish these conditions, which otherwise have a similar appearance. Reed-Sternberg cells are usually positive for CD23.

<doc id="2875860" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2875860" title="Aminocaproic acid">
Aminocaproic acid

Aminocaproic acid (also known as Amicar, ε-aminocaproic acid, ε-Ahx, or 6-aminohexanoic acid) is a derivative and analogue of the amino acid lysine, which makes it an effective inhibitor for enzymes that bind that particular residue. Such enzymes include proteolytic enzymes like plasmin, the enzyme responsible for fibrinolysis. For this reason it is effective in treatment of certain bleeding disorders, and it is marketed as Amicar. Aminocaproic acid is also an intermediate in the polymerization of Nylon-6, where it is formed by ring-opening hydrolysis of caprolactam.
Clinical use.
Aminocaproic acid is used to treat excessive postoperative bleeding, especially after procedures in which a great amount of bleeding is expected, such as cardiac surgery. It can be given orally or intravenously. A meta-analysis found that lysine analogs like aminocaproic acid significantly reduced blood loss in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
Aminocaproic acid can also be used to treat the overdose and/or toxic effects of the thrombolytic pharmacologic agents tissue plasminogen activator (commonly known as tPA) and streptokinase.
Bleeding due to elevated fibrinolytic activity.
Aminocaproic acid is used for the treatment of excessive bleeding resulting from systemic hyperfibrinolysis and urinary fibrinolysis. In life-threatening situations, fresh whole blood, fibrinogen infusions, and other emergency measures also may be required.
Aminocaproic acid is used in systemic hyperfibrinolysis associated with surgical complications following heart surgery (with or without cardiac bypass procedures) and portacaval shunt; in carcinoma of the lung, prostate, cervix, or stomach; in abruptio placentae; and in hematologic disorders such as amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia accompanying aplastic anemia (reduces the need for platelet transfusions).
Aminocaproic acid is used in urinary fibrinolysis associated with complications of severe trauma, anoxia, and shock, and as manifested by surgical hematuria especially following prostatectomy and nephrectomy, or in nonsurgical hematuria accompanying polycystic or neoplastic disease of the GU tract.
Aminocaproic acid is used in conjunction with heparin therapy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Use is not currently included in the labeling approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. It is used as initiate therapy when plasma α2-antiplasmin (α2-plasmin inhibitor) levels have decreased to <40% of normal levels.
Ocular hemorrhage.
Aminocaproic acid has been used effectively for the prevention of secondary ocular hemorrhage in patients with nonperforating traumatic hyphema (Use is not currently included in the labeling approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.). Designated an orphan drug by FDA for topical treatment of traumatic hyphema.
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.
Aminocaproic acid has been used orally for the management of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. This use is not currently included in the labeling approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Side effects.
Its side effects include nausea, vomiting, and chronic mild fevers (37.2 to 37.8 °C). When used long-term (for approximately 6 to 12 months), there is a risk of the inflammation of one's internal organs, especially the appendix (appendicitis) and liver, as well as failure of the liver and cyanosis. It almost always causes generalized myalgia and fibromyalgia. In some cases, successive organ failure can occur after long-term usage. However, the main risk associated with aminocaproic acid is the increased risk for thrombosis because of the inhibition of fibrinolysis.

<doc id="2875862" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2875862" title="Heckler &amp; Koch HK36">
Heckler &amp; Koch HK36

The HK36 was an experimental assault rifle introduced by Heckler & Koch in the early 1970s. At the time, research in small-caliber military cartridges had become more popular thanks to the United States' adoption and combat use of the M16 and its 5.56 mm round. 
The HK36 rifle fired a 4.6×36 mm round whose bullet has a "spoon point" (German: "Löffelspitz") designed by CETME's Dr. Gunther Voss. Low bullet weight and the straight-line layout of the rifle reduced recoil, while the high velocity of the round gave it an almost flat trajectory out to , which was also the limit of its effective range. Beyond that point, the bullet lost velocity very quickly.
Operation.
The HK36 used H&K's delayed blowback system, with a four-position selector switch for the firing mode. In order from top to bottom, these were safe (marked "0"), single-shot ("1"), full-automatic ("25" or "30") and controlled burst ("3")—however, the weapon was intended to be available with 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-round burst mode.
Ejection of empty cartridge cases was to the right, while the bolt remained open once all ammunition had been expended.
Magazine.
Early versions of the weapon had a standard detachable box magazine made from stamped metal.
The method of reloading for the later prototypes was an unusual departure from modern systems, being intended to reduce weight along with eliminating the handling of individual rounds. The rifle had a metal box mounted permanently below the receiver, in front of the trigger guard; this magazine had a side-opening "door" through which a pre-packaged box of 30 cartridges could be inserted once a knob on the rifle had been pulled down. The box had an open top and bottom, closed by tape, so that the magazine follower could push the rounds up into the rifle during firing.
Variants.
As mentioned, early models used a conventional detachable box magazine while later versions had the integral one. In addition, most of the rifles appear to have been fitted with a telescoping stock of a completely different type than that fitted to most other Heckler & Koch weapons (such as the G3 and MP5), but some are known with a fixed, plastic stock.
Legacy.
Despite never being accepted for military service, the rifle was notable for introducing the three-round burst concept and integrated optics to Heckler & Koch weapons. The various innovations gave H&K some interesting ideas for the future, which have resurfaced in the Heckler & Koch MP7 PDW and G36 rifle.
